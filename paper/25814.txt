ABSTRACT
Takeover targets often experience substantial share price appreciations around public
announcements of mergers and acquisitions. We analyze hedge fund and mutual fund holdings
around takeover announcements to assess the differences in investment strategies across
institutions. Our results indicate that hedge funds in the aggregate increase their holdings of soonto-be takeover targets by 7.2% during the quarter prior to the public announcement. Conversely,
mutual funds reduce their equity holdings in impending targets by 3.0% during the quarter before
M&A announcements and therefore potentially forgo profitable investment opportunities.

Introduction

Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) often generate substantial appreciation of the targets’
equity. As Figure 1 illustrates, the stock prices of target companies increase on average by
more than 20% immediately after the public announcements of M&A transactions. Trading
in anticipation of these announcements can significantly improve the performance of an
investment strategy.1 In this paper, we analyze the holdings of hedge funds and mutual
funds around takeover announcements to better understand the investment strategies of
these two types of institutions.
Different types of investors might have different access to private information or distinct
abilities to process public information since they exhibit various regulatory restrictions,
compensation structures, and trading strategies. For example, whereas mutual funds face
significant regulatory restrictions and disclosure requirements, hedge funds are less regulated and offer limited transparency. Also, the compensation of hedge fund managers
is typically more performance sensitive than the compensation of mutual fund managers.
Moreover, although mutual funds frequently follow more straight-forward long-only investment strategies, hedge funds often take advantage of more complex investment strategies
that use derivatives, short-selling, and leverage.2 Consequently, the incentives and the ability to obtain private information and process complex public information is likely to vary
by institutional type.
To study the trading strategies of institutional investors around M&A deals, we analyze
a sample of 7,184 M&A announcements from 1990 through 2015. Our main results show that
1

As noted by Jensen and Ruback (1983), Holmström and Kaplan (2001), Betton, Eckbo, and Thorburn
(2008), and many others, M&A deals are among the main events of corporations.

hedge funds substantially increase their holdings in takeover candidates before the merger
announcement. In contrast, we find that mutual funds reduce their exposure to takeover
candidates before the merger announcement. The target ownership changes in takeover
targets by both mutual funds and hedge funds are not only statistically significant but also
economically important. On average, hedge fund ownership in impending takeover targets
increases by 7.2% (from 3.74% to 4.02% of shares outstanding) during the quarter prior to
the merger announcement. On the other hand, mutual fund ownership in takeover targets
decreases by 3.0% (from 11.82% to 11.46% as a fraction of the target’s shares outstanding)
during the calendar quarter preceding the public merger announcement. The decline in
mutual fund ownership of to-be takeover targets becomes more pronounced if we adjust
for the change in mutual fund ownership in peer firms with similar characteristics over our
sample period. Notably, at least some of the decline in mutual fund ownership can be
attributed to an equilibrium response to the increase in ownership of hedge funds.
Although our analysis focuses mostly on the portfolio changes in the quarters prior
to the public announcement of an M&A transaction, we find that the ownership changes
further accelerate during the announcement quarter. Mutual fund ownership decreases by
27.2% (from 11.46% to 8.39% of shares outstanding) and hedge fund ownership increases by
53.0% (from 4.02% to 6.13% of shares outstanding) during the quarter the M&A transaction
is publicly announced. Using daily mutual fund returns we find that, during the M&A
announcement quarter, most of the ownership change occurs after the deal is announced.
Mutual funds are less interested in the target stock after the M&A announcement, since the
stock price of the target will depend primarily on the stock price of the acquirer (if the target
shareholders are paid in shares of the acquiring company) or on the offer price (if the target
shareholders are paid in cash). Conversely, the increase in hedge fund ownership during
the announcement quarter is consistent with merger arbitrage strategies, as discussed by
Mitchell and Pulvino (2001), Baker and Savasoglu (2002), Hsieh and Walking (2005), and
Jiang, Li, and Mei (2016).
To investigate whether our results are affected by Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg-FD),

3

which requires that all material information be shared with all investors at the same time,
we compare the ownership changes before and after 2001. Our results indicate qualitatively
similar effects before and after the regulatory change. Furthermore, the ownership changes
are also robust across transactions of different sizes, different takeover premia, and different
deal characteristics.
In an analysis of all publicly-traded firms, we find that increases in hedge fund ownership
and decreases in mutual fund ownership over several quarters increase the probability that
a company becomes a takeover target in subsequent quarters. This analysis also allows
us to control for common characteristics of the companies (e.g., industry, size, market-tobook, momentum) that might be used as trading signals by institutional investors. We
find that the ownership changes by mutual funds and hedge funds remain an economically
and statistically significant predictor of M&A transactions after controlling for these style
characteristics. These results indicate that the trading decisions of mutual funds and hedge
funds are not subsumed by these common characteristics.
Our results on ownership changes might be affected by the affiliation of fund management companies with the advisors for the acquirers and targets, as previously discussed by
Bodnaruk, Massa, and Simonov (2009). These asset management firms might obtain early
access to the information about a forthcoming acquisition. We find that the ownership in
a target firm by mutual funds affiliated with the target’s M&A advisor increases slightly
several quarters prior to the M&A announcement. Conversely, we note that the ownership
in a target firm by mutual funds affiliated with the acquirer’s M&A advisor declines in
the quarters prior to the M&A announcement, consistent with our overall results. Thus,
trading by affiliated investors does not explain our results in the overall sample.
We also study whether our hedge fund results are driven by the activist hedge funds
identified by Brav, Jiang, and Kim (2015). Of the 7,184 M&A takeover targets in our
sample, only 76 are associated with hedge fund activism. Our results show that hedge
fund activists significantly increase their stakes in these 76 target companies prior to M&A
deal announcements. In contrast, ownership changes by non-activist hedge funds are less

4

pronounced. These findings suggest activism as a possible channel that some hedge funds
may use to generate gains. However, the ownership changes by activist hedge funds cannot
explain the vast majority of the trading in takeover targets prior to the announcement.
Next, we analyze whether there are important cross-sectional differences among institutional investors who trade the targets’ equity prior to merger announcements. We find
significant persistence in the ownership stakes held across time by both mutual funds and
hedge funds. Specifically, funds that allocate a higher weight in to-be targets a quarter
prior to the announcement tend to allocate a higher portfolio weight to future targets as
well. This evidence indicates that there are systematic differences in allocations toward
upcoming targets across funds.
While a substantial literature documents that the performance of mutual funds and
other investors is related to several fund characteristics,3 there is a paucity of research on
the specific investment strategies that they use to generate abnormal performance. We
study whether the allocation to future target companies is related to the activeness of a
fund. We use three different proxies for active management: the Active Share of Cremers
and Petajisto (2009), the R2 of Amihud and Goyenko (2013), and the absolute value of the
Return Gap of Kacperczyk, Sialm, and Zheng (2008). We find that mutual funds that are
more actively managed tend to decrease their ownership of future takeover targets to a lesser
extent. Thus, less active funds, which have been shown to exhibit lower investment ability
than more active mutual funds, tend to forgo the largest benefits of takeover announcements
by selling out their shares in takeover targets prematurely.
Our work contributes to the active debate on whether institutional investors profit from
takeover announcements. Jegadeesh and Tang (2010) find that institutional investors whose
main broker is also a target advisor are net buyers of target shares before announcements
and their pre-announcement trades are significantly profitable. Similarly, Lowry, Rossi, and
3

See for example, Carhart (1997), Wermers (2000), Chen, Jagadeesh, and Wermers (2000), Kacperczyk,
Sialm, and Zheng (2005, 2008), Gaspar, Massa, and Matos (2006), Massa and Rehman (2008), Bodnaruk,
Massa, and Simonov (2009), Cremers and Petajisto (2009), Agrawal and Nasser (2012), Edmans, Goldstein,
and Jiang (2012), Amihud and Goyenko (2013), Berk and Van Binsbergen (2015), Pastor, Stambaugh, and
Taylor (2015), Cremers, Ferreira, Matos, and Starks (2016), and Jiang and Zheng (2018).

Zhu (2018) use evidence from options holdings to find that advisor banks trade in client
firms ahead of merger announcements In contrast, Griffin, Shu, and Topaloglu (2012) do
not find much evidence to support that investment bank clients take advantage of takeover
advising connections. Whereas those papers are primarily interested in short-term trading
immediately prior to the merger announcement, we analyze trades over longer horizons
for a broader set of mutual fund and hedge funds. We add to this literature by showing
that, unlike mutual funds, some hedge funds accumulate large stakes in soon-to-be takeover
targets. In a related study, Dai, Massoud, Nandy, and Saunders (2017) analyze the trading
by short- and long-term hedge funds around merger announcements. Our paper focuses on
the overall trades of institutional investors and contrasts mutual funds and hedge funds.
This study also contributes to the literature that investigates the specific methods that
institutional investors use to create value for their investors. Cohen, Frazzini, and Malloy
(2008) find that fund managers exhibit superior performance when they trade shares of
firms they are connected through their educational networks. Baker, Litov, Wachter, and
Wurgler (2010) find that a significant amount of outperformance of mutual funds takes
place around corporate earnings announcements. Our paper moves this literature forward
by showing that some investment managers create value by increasing their holdings in
prospective takeover targets.
Our paper also adds important evidence to the strand of the M&A literature evaluating
the role of institutional investors during these transactions (see, for example, Officer, Ozbas,
and Sensoy (2010), Greenwood and Schor (2009), and Fich, Harford, and Tran (2015)).
The paper proceeds as follows. We describe the sample construction and the summary
statistics in Section 2. Section 3 includes the empirical results on trading by mutual funds
and hedge funds. Section 4 provides cross-sectional evidence. Section 5 concludes.

Data and Sample Construction

We obtain information on M&A deals for the period of 1990 through 2015 from the SDC
database. The initial sample of completed and withdrawn deals consists of 34,144 transactions with the following deal characteristics: mergers, acquisitions, and acquisitions of a
majority interest. We eliminate targets that are not publicly traded and those that have a
market capitalization of less than $25 million four quarters prior to the deal announcement
(in real 2015 dollars). This yields 7,184 transactions.
The Thomson holdings database provides data on mutual fund equity holdings. To
merge the Thomson holdings database with the CRSP Mutual fund database, we use
MFLINKS from the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS). To examine the evolution of
hedge fund trading in target firms, we identify those within the pool of all 13F institutions
reported in Thomson Financial. We use the hedge fund identifier from Maslennikov and
Hund (2015).4
We obtain mutual fund monthly returns, expenses, total net assets, turnover ratio, and
other fund characteristics from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) SurvivorBias-Free Mutual Fund database. Individual stock prices and returns are from the CRSP
monthly stock file and firm characteristics are from the COMPUSTAT database.
Panel A of Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the 7,184 M&A offers in our sample.
These deals have a completion rate of 82.1%. About 42.4% of the transactions in our sample
are paid fully in cash, and 26.6% are paid fully in stock. Deals with multiple bidders
constitute 9.6% of our sample. In 68.1% of the offers, the deals are diversifying since both
the target and the bidder operate in different industries. About 18.7% of the transactions are
tender offers and 9.3% are characterized as hostile. The premium offered according to the
SDC database is 40.7%. This premium is measured relative to the price four weeks prior to
the announcement date. The average market capitalization of the targets is $1,420 million.
However, the distribution of market capitalizations is fairly wide: the 5th percentile equals

7

$33 million and the 95th percentile equals $5,776 million. The average market-to-book ratio
of the target firms is 2.4. These summary statistics are similar to those reported in other
M&A studies (e.g., Gaspar, Massa, and Matos (2005), Chen, Harford, and Li (2007), and
Fich, Harford, and Tran (2015)).
The benefit of owning a target’s equity during the M&A announcement is substantial.
Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of the average cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) around
M&As during the trading day window [-250; +55] relative to the deal announcement date.
Pt
We calculate cumulative abnormal returns as CARij =
j=1 (rij − rmj ), where rij is a
firm’s i0 s return and rmj is the CRSP value-weighted market return at time j. To mitigate
the effect of delisting on CARs after announcements, we set abnormal returns of delisted
targets to zero. The three-day average CAR for the targets in our sample is 20.5%. We find
a significant increase in the prices of target companies prior to the M&A announcement, as
shown previously by Keown and Pinkerton (1981) and Schwert (1996). The mean return in
the year prior to the announcement for the target stock is 9.3%.
To obtain the aggregate holdings of takeover candidates by mutual funds, we sum the
holdings by any mutual funds in the Thomson holdings mutual fund database over the
period from 1990-2015.
For the cross-sectional results in Sections 3.7.2, 3.9, and 4, we focus on a smaller sample
of actively-managed domestic equity mutual funds. We start with a sample of 3,864 funds
for the period 1990-2015 in the Thomson holdings database with available fund names and
with the following investment objective styles: aggressive growth, growth, and growth and
income. We eliminate index funds by screening out fund names for the following words:
“Index,” “Indx,” “Market,” “S&P,” “ETF,” and “NYSE.” Consistent with other studies
(e.g. Kacperczyk, Sialm and Zheng, 2008), we remove fund observations with fewer than 11
stocks in a portfolio. As a result, we obtain 3,640 funds. Next, we record fund returns, total
net assets under management (TNA), and other fund characteristics (e.g., turnover, expense
ratio) from the CRSP Survivor-Bias-Free Mutual Fund database and merge these data with
the Thomson holdings database. There are a number of mutual funds with multiple share

8

classes. Typically, fund share classes differ in fee structure and clientele (e.g., institutional
or retail). Similar to the procedure used by Kacperczyk, Sialm, and Zheng (2008) and
Wermers, Yao, and Zhao (2012), we combine multiple share classes into one fund. We then
calculate the TNA for each fund as the sum of all values of assets across multiple fund shares.
Fund age is the maximum age of its share classes. For the remaining fund characteristics, we
aggregate different share classes by taking the TNA-weighted average across all share classes
of a fund. We exclude the first 18 months of fund returns to decrease the impact of the
incubation bias reported by Evans (2010). In addition, we require non-missing fund returns
and non-missing total net assets under management. Because Elton, Gruber, and Blake
(2001) suggest that the returns of funds with TNA less than $15 million are biased upwards
in the CRSP Mutual Fund database, we exclude all funds with TNAs below $15 million
as of the beginning of the month. In addition, we require non-missing fund characteristics
(age, turnover, and expense ratio). Our smaller sample of actively-managed domestic funds
contains 1,926 unique funds.
Panel B of Table 1 provides summary statistics for our sample of mutual funds. These
are calculated from 70,200 fund-quarter observations. The average fund manages around
$2 billion in assets, is 19 years old, has an expense ratio of 1.22%, and exhibits a turnover
ratio of 80%. On average, funds achieve a raw portfolio return net of expenses of 2.22% per
quarter and attract flows of 2.29% per quarter. These summary statistics are consistent
with those documented in the literature (e.g., Huang, Sialm, and Zhang (2011), Amihud
and Goyenko (2013), and Jiang and Verardo (2018)). The activeness of a mutual fund is
captured by its Active Share following Cremers and Petajisto (2009), the R-squared from
Amihud and Goyenko (2013), and the absolute Return Gap over the prior 12 months from
Kacperczyk, Sialm, and Zheng (2008).5 The funds in our sample have an average Active
Share of 81.4%, an average 1 − R2 of 13.3%, and an absolute Return Gap of 0.26%.
To construct our sample of hedge funds, we obtain institutional holdings from the Thom5

son institutional holdings database over the period of 1990-2015. There are 6,569 unique
institutional investors who file a 13F schedule during this time period. Using the updated
identifier from Maslennikov and Hund (2015), we obtain 1,162 unique hedge funds. Based
on the reported 13F holdings across 31,089 fund-quarter observations, an average hedge
fund holds about 93 stocks in its portfolio. This constitutes about $885 million in equity
holdings. The average hedge fund reports its holdings over a period of six years.

Mutual Fund and Hedge Fund Trading in Takeover Targets

In this section we analyze the holdings of mutual funds and hedge funds around takeover
announcements. We present both univariate and multivariate analyses.

3.1

Univariate Analysis for the Overall Sample

We start by examining the aggregate mutual fund and hedge fund ownership in takeover
targets around the M&A announcement. For each target, we calculate the total number of
shares held by all mutual funds as a fraction of total shares outstanding in each of the four
quarters prior to the M&A announcement quarter, which are denoted as Q(t) − 4 through
Q(t) − 1.6 Similarly, we aggregate hedge fund ownership for each to-be target and analyze
the ownership by these investors as a fraction of shares outstanding. We also report the
holdings of mutual funds and hedge funds at the end of the announcement quarter Q(t).
Figure 2 compares the evolution of mutual fund and hedge fund ownership in to-be
targets from several quarters prior to the M&A announcement until one quarter after.
Panel A depicts the aggregate ownership of takeover targets, whereas Panel B reports the
difference in aggregate ownership between takeover targets and matched control firms. The
figures show that hedge funds start building their positions in takeover targets well ahead of
the merger announcement date. In contrast, mutual funds gradually reduce their positions
in these firms. According to Figure 2, mutual funds are net sellers of takeover targets, and
6

We adjust holdings for stock splits by multiplying the reported number of shares by the CRSP adjustment
factor.

10

hedge funds, in aggregate, are net buyers of these potentially profitable stocks.
For both mutual funds and hedge funds, we test the statistical significance of the changes
in takeover target ownership during the merger pre-announcement period. We cluster the
standard errors by time, since several takeover announcements can take place in the same
quarter and since the mutual fund and hedge fund holdings are available at a quarterly frequency. Table 2 reports the results. We find that mutual fund ownership in takeover targets
significantly decreases by 36 basis points (from 11.82% to 11.46% of shares outstanding)
one quarter prior to the announcement quarter. The average change in aggregate mutual
fund ownership during the previous quarters is small in magnitude. In contrast, we observe
persistent increases in target ownership by hedge funds during the quarters preceding the
M&A announcement quarter. Hedge fund ownership in takeover targets increases by 27
basis points (from 3.74% to 4.02%) during the quarter prior to the announcement and by
63 basis points (from 3.38% to 4.02%) during the three quarters prior to the announcement.
The largest ownership changes occur during the announcement quarter. Mutual funds
decrease their holdings of target stocks from 11.46% to 8.39% of shares outstanding, whereas
hedge funds increase their ownership from 4.02% to 6.13%. We do not know whether the
positions in takeover targets are adjusted before or after the public M&A announcements.
The accumulation of target stocks by hedge funds might be due to merger arbitrage strategies by hedge funds.7 On the other hand, mutual funds might reduce their holdings in
the targets after the M&A announcement since they might not be interested in holding the
shares of the acquiring firm if the deal is stock financed or since they might not be interested
in holding a stock where the value depends primarily on the offer price if the deal is cash
financed. We explore these issues in more detail in Section 3.7.
Panel B summarizes the number of separate mutual funds and hedge funds that own
shares in the target firms. We observe that the number of mutual funds significantly de7

A common strategy of hedge funds is to purchase target company stocks immediately after the public
announcement, as discussed by Mitchell and Pulvino (2001), Baker and Savasoglu (2002), and Hsieh and
Walking (2005). Jiang, Li, and Mei (2016) provide evidence that activist shareholders can change the course
of an announced M&A deal through public campaigns.

11

creases from 64.39 to 62.43 and the number of hedge funds significantly increases from 5.11
to 5.47 in the quarter prior to the announcement.8 The change in the number of mutual
funds and hedge funds (i.e., extensive margin) accounts for most of the change in the aggregate ownership proportion of these institutions. On the other hand, the change in the
ownership share conditional on owning the target firm (i.e., intensive margin) is relatively
small. Thus, the ownership changes are driven primarily by exits and entries of institutions
and not by partial reallocation or rebalancing among institutions owning the target stocks.
It is at first glance surprising that mutual funds reduce their holdings in companies that
are subsequently becoming takeover candidates. These funds might forgo significant gains
by prematurely selling these companies due to the large announcement effects. However,
it must be recognized that if one type of investor accumulates some securities then it is
necessary that another type of investor decumulates these securities in equilibrium. Thus,
as hedge funds build up positions in impending takeover candidates other investors, such
as mutual funds, have to liquidate their positions. These results are consistent with the
hypothesis that hedge funds have superior information or better information processing
ability than mutual funds, as least with respect to M&A announcements.

3.2

Economic Magnitude

We estimate the economic effects of changing institutional ownership prior to merger announcements by calculating the dollar amount of these changes in target holdings. We
multiply the change in aggregate mutual fund shares (in the quarter prior to the M&A
announcement) by the end-of-quarter target share price. Mutual funds, on average, reduce
their holdings in to-be targets on average by $2.95 million. In contrast, hedge funds increase
their holdings in target firms, on average, by $3.83 million.
To consider various scenarios of the dollar amount associated with declining mutual
8

The number of hedge fund owners corresponds to the number of management companies that own
specific stocks, since the 13-F filings by hedge funds are reported at the management company and not the
fund level. The number of unique hedge fund owners can therefore be larger since a management company
can have multiple distinct hedge funds.

12

fund ownership (including price run-ups, announcement premiums, and price markups), we
multiply the aggregate change in shares during the quarter prior to the announcement by
the price change from the end of the prior quarter to the day prior to the announcement
(i.e., run-up), the price change from one day before to one day after the announcement
(i.e., premium), and the price change from one day after to 60 days after the announcement
(i.e., markup).9 The average values for mutual funds across the 7, 184 deals amount to
−$344, 523 for the run-up, −$775, 006 for the premium, and −$350, 818 for the markup.
Thus, the mutual fund sector as a whole leaves significant “money on the table” by trading
the target stocks prematurely.
Using a similar procedure, we find that the hedge fund sector gains, on average, for
each deal as a result of increasing their ownership in to-be targets in the quarter prior to
the announcement: $204, 571 from the run-up, $350, 062 from the premium, and $101, 325
from the markup. Overall, our evidence suggests that mutual funds in the aggregate are
not informed about upcoming merger announcements. In contrast, many hedge funds are
either informed about future deal announcements or are skillful enough to predict these
events.

3.3

Matched Subsample

Table 3 reports the ownership proportion by mutual funds and hedge funds for the target
firms and for the matched control firms. Firms are matched by industry classification,
market capitalization, and book-to-market ratio.10 Although mutual fund ownership in
9

The run-up is defined as (NQ(t)−1 − NQ(t)−2 ) × (Pt−1 − PQ(t)−1 ), where NQ(t)−1 is the number of shares
held at the end of the quarter immediately preceding the announcement quarter, NQ(t)−2 is the number of
shares held at the end of the quarter two quarters prior to the announcement quarter, Pt−1 is the price of
the target stock on the trading day prior to the announcement, and PQ(t)−1 is the price of the target stock
at the end of the quarter immediately preceding the announcement quarter. The premium is defined as
(NQ(t)−1 − NQ(t)−2 ) × (Pt+1 − Pt−1 ), where Pt+1 is the price of the target stock on the trading day after
the announcement. Finally, the markup is defined as (NQ(t)−1 − NQ(t)−2 ) × (Pt+60 − Pt+1 ), where Pt+60 is
the price of the target stock 60 trading days after the announcement.
10

To assemble the matching sample, we use the following procedure. We have 7,146 out of 7,184 target
firms with non-missing industry codes and market capitalizations. We impute the book value data with any
available observations going back up to four quarters from Q(t) − 4. This results in 6,589 target firms with
available book values (557 targets are with missing book values). Next, we match on the 48 Fama-French

13

target firms decreases by 36 basis points in the quarter prior to the announcement, it
increases by 18 basis points for the matched firms.11 The decline in mutual fund ownership
of target firms is further strengthened if we adjust for the change in mutual fund ownership
of peer firms during our sample. This decline can therefore not be explained by changes
in ownership triggered by the style characteristics of the target stocks. In contrast, the
increase in hedge fund ownership of target firms of 28 basis points in the quarter prior to
the announcement is slightly reduced if we adjust for the increase in hedge fund ownership
of matched control firms of 8 basis points. Thus, the change in the average hedge fund
ownership in target stocks can partially be explained by changes in hedge fund ownership
for stocks with similar style characteristics as target stocks.
We also observe that the matched control firms tend to exhibit lower ownership by
both mutual funds and hedge funds than the actual target firms in the quarters prior to
the merger announcement. We discuss next whether this could be due to the fact that
institutional ownership might increase the probability of takeovers.

3.4

Institutional Ownership and Takeover Probability

Hedge funds might purchase stocks with specific characteristics (e.g., small stocks, value
stocks, momentum stocks). These stocks, in turn, might also be more likely to become
takeover targets, because acquiring companies might consider similar characteristics when
selecting potential takeover targets, as discussed by Edmans, Goldstein, and Jiang (2012).
Furthermore, hedge funds might not only increase their positions in eventual takeover candidates, they might also increase their positions in similar firms that fail to become takeover
industry classification and time and make sure that the book-to-market ratios and the market capitalizations
of the potential control firms at the end of quarter Q(t) − 4 are between 0.5 and 2 times the corresponding
values of the target firms. We eliminate self-matches and other firms that become takeover targets in any of
the six quarters Q(t) − 4, Q(t) − 3, Q(t) − 2, Q(t) − 1, Q(t), and Q(t) + 1. We also require non-missing shares
outstanding in four quarters prior to and in the announcement quarter. If there are multiple candidates,
we pick the firm with the closest market capitalization to that of the target firm. This process yields 6,259
matches.
11
The ownership changes differ slightly between Tables 2 and 3 since we do not have valid control firms for
all takeover targets. Table 2 is based on 7,184 takeover targets, whereas Table 3 is based on 6,259 takeover
targets.

candidates and therefore might experience a decline in their stock prices since the anticipated acquisition does not materialize.
To address these concerns, we estimate linear probability specifications modeling the
probability that a company receives a takeover bid using the universe of publicly traded
firms and controlling for firm characteristics.12 Our tests explore the effect of mutual fund
and hedge fund ownership (both in levels and in changes during the M&A pre-announcement
period) on the probability of a takeover. In Table 4, the dependent variable is one if a firm
is a takeover target during the announcement quarter, Q(t), and 0, otherwise. The variables
of interest in these regressions include the mutual and hedge fund level ownership in firms
in Q(t) − 4, as well as the changes in ownership by these institutional investors during the
quarters preceding the M&A announcement quarter.
The control variables are the target firm’s market capitalization, market-to-book ratio,
and one-year stock return. These controls capture popular quantitative investment strategies based on size, value, and momentum. The standard errors are clustered at the quarter
level and the regressions include time-fixed effects and two-digit SIC fixed effects.
Consistent with our univariate results, the results in Table 4 show that ownership
changes in the quarters prior to the announcement are related to the likelihood of a company becoming a target. The likelihood decreases if mutual funds raise their ownership and
increases if hedge funds raise their ownership prior to the public announcements.
Controlling for style characteristics of the target firms does not qualitatively affect the
results. In fact, the magnitude of the hedge fund results increase after controlling for
style characteristics. The results also show that both mutual and hedge fund ownership in
Q(t) − 4 are positively associated with the probability of a firm becoming a takeover target
four quarters later. The coefficients on the control variables indicate that smaller firms and
firms with lower market-to-book ratios are more likely to become takeover targets.
The fact that the effects of institutional ownership on the takeover probability are spread
over several quarters indicates that the ownership changes are not just due to the anticipa12

Our results from logit regressions are consistent.

15

tion of imminent takeovers. Changes in holdings have long-lasting associations with firms
that are becoming takeover targets.

3.5

Changes Around Regulation FD

Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg-FD), passed in 2000, requires that all material information
be shared with all investors at the same time. In Table 5, we separate the takeovers
according to whether they were announced during 1990-2000 or during 2001-2015. Despite
these changes, we find consistent results across the two sub-samples. Mutual funds reduce
and hedge funds increase their holdings of takeover targets prior to the announcement
during both time periods. The magnitudes of the portfolio changes appear stronger during
the more recent time period (2001-2015). However, this result is primarily due to the growth
of the holdings for both fund types. Thus, changes in regulation and other changes over our
time period do not qualitatively affect institutional trades around merger announcements.

3.6

Univariate Subsamples by Deal Characteristics

We also perform univariate tests for partitions of targets with different deal characteristics.

3.6.1

Target Size

We divide in Panel A of Table 6 the sample based on the market capitalization of the
targets four quarters prior to the announcement. The results are broadly consistent across
the three subsamples. For all size groups, mutual funds reduce their ownership prior to
the M&A announcement, whereas hedge funds increase it. The ownership levels by mutual
funds and hedge funds tend to be more substantial for larger targets (in terms of their
market capitalizations). For example, four quarters prior to the takeover announcement,
mutual funds hold 5.06% of shares outstanding for targets below $100 million and 17.04%
for targets above $250 million.

16

3.6.2

Target Premium

Panels B and C of Table 6 examine whether funds’ purchases are stronger in targets with
higher premiums and three-day CARs around the deal announcements. We sort targets
based on SDC premiums and three-day CARs around M&A announcements. Overall, we
find qualitatively similar results across subsamples. We do not find that hedge fund buying
activity is more pronounced for more profitable transactions. Indeed, the increase in hedge
fund ownership is stronger for targets that experience lower CARs around announcements.
It is possible that hedge fund trading increases the pre-announcement price of to-be targets
which, in turn, may lower the price appreciation during the public M&A announcement.

3.6.3

Tender Offers

An interesting finding is that mutual funds substantially reduce their ownership in targets
associated with tender offers (by 128 basis points) relatively to non-tender deals (by 15 basis
points) in the quarter prior to the announcement, as reported in Panel D. Tender offers are
generally more of a surprise than non-tender offers, which may explain why we see stronger
selling activity among mutual funds for this type of deals. Mutual funds might be less
reluctant to sell securities if they cannot anticipate an impending merger announcement.

3.6.4

Multiple Bidders

Panel E of Table 6 separates the sample between transactions with multiple bidders and
transactions with single bidders. Slightly less than 10% of target companies attract multiple
bidders. While our baseline findings for both mutual funds and hedge funds are unaltered,
we observe more pronounced ownership changes in the minority of deals with multiple
bidders.

3.6.5

Deal Completion

Our sample includes complete and incomplete (or withdrawn) takeover attempts. We observe results consistent with our main findings across both subsamples, as summarized in
17

Panel F. Interestingly, the ownership changes are slightly stronger in the subsample of
incomplete deals. The increase in ownership by hedge funds in the subset of withdrawn
deals is notable given that Malmendier, Opp, and Saidi (2016) find that many targets in
withdrawn deals experience a permanent revaluation of 15% for all cash targets.
In general, the subsample results in Table 6 corroborate our main findings: prior to
M&A announcements, mutual funds tend to decrease and hedge funds tend to increase
their ownership in takeover candidates across different time periods and for deals with
different characteristics.

3.7

Dynamic Ownership Changes

We can only observe institutional ownership at a quarterly frequency. This prevents us
from studying trades during a shorter window around takeover announcements. In this
subsection, we indirectly infer the higher-frequency trading of institutional investors by
evaluating ownership changes for deals announced at different times during a quarter and
by taking advantage of daily fund returns.

3.7.1

Timing of Announcements

Table 7 divides our sample of deals based on the timing of the M&A announcement during
the event quarter. Such timing is informative because it helps us to understand the timing
of trades within a quarter. For example, if a merger announcement takes place at the
beginning of quarter Q(t), then the holdings at the end of quarter Q(t)−1 are more likely to
incorporate the trades by institutions that anticipate an imminent takeover announcement.
On the other hand, the holdings at the end of quarter Q(t) − 1 are less likely to incorporate
a takeover announcement that occurs at the end of quarter Q(t). Of the 7,184 deals, 1,479
are announced within the first 20 calendar days of the quarter, 4,073 are announced in
the middle of the quarter, and the remaining 1,632 deals become public within the last 20
calendar days of the announcement quarter.
The estimates in Table 7 show stronger ownership changes in the quarter prior to the

18

M&A announcement by funds for transactions announced at the beginning of the event
quarter. This evidence indicates that trading by mutual funds and hedge funds in takeover
targets accelerates immediately prior to the M&A announcement. Thus, the trades in
quarter Q(t) − 1 prior to the announcement (reported in Table 2) likely understate the
overall trading activity prior to the M&A announcement because additional trading occurs
just before the announcement during quarter Q(t).

3.7.2

Daily Fund Returns

An alternative way to infer the timing of trades is to compare the daily returns of mutual
funds on the announcement dates with the returns of the holdings of the mutual funds
including and excluding the target stock holdings. The actual fund return will correspond
more closely to the holdings return including the target stock if the mutual fund continues
to hold the target stock on the announcement day. On the other hand, the actual fund
return will correspond more closely to the holdings return excluding the target stock if the
mutual fund sells the target stock prior to the announcement.
Conditional on the mutual fund owning of a target at the end of quarter Q(t) − 1, we
compare the actual (reported) fund return with the holdings-based-return including and
excluding the target’s stock over a three day window around the M&A announcement.13
We focus in this subsection on the sample of domestic equity mutual funds, as summarized
in Panel B of Table 1 and described in Section 2.
The results are reported in Panel A of Table 8. Mutual funds holding target stocks at
the end of the prior quarter generate an actual return of 21.1 basis points during a three13

The holdings-based return is calculated as the value-weighted average three-day return across various
asset classes of the portfolio composition. For each fund at Q(t) − 1, we obtain the percent of a portfolio
allocated to equities, cash, and bonds/preferred stocks from the CRSP fund summary file. The return on the
equity part of the portfolio is based on the mutual fund holdings at Q(t) − 1 and is obtained by multiplying
the stock weight by the corresponding three-day stock return around the deal announcement date, and
summing these products at the portfolio level. We proxy for the cash and bond/preferred stock returns
using published indices. For bonds and preferred stocks, we use the total return of the Bloomberg Barclays
US Aggregate Bond Index, while for cash holdings we use the one-month Treasury bill rate. We adjust the
holdings-based returns for the three-day expense ratio, obtained by dividing the annual fund expense ratio
into 250 and multiplying by 3. The weights of the equity positions are rebalanced for the portfolio that
excludes the target stock.

19

day window around the announcement of the M&A transaction. In addition, the average
three-day return based on the previously-disclosed holdings amounts to 24.3 basis points
including the target stock and 16.5 basis points excluding the target stock. The difference
between the holdings returns including and excluding the target stock of 7.8 basis points is
due to the announcement effect of the target stock.
We also compare the actual fund returns with the holdings returns for our sample of
control firms. We consider mutual funds that invest in the control firms at the end of
the quarter prior to the acquisition announcements. This comparison with control funds
is important since the reported fund return might be systematically different from the
holdings return due to unobserved trading costs or interim trading benefits, as discussed
by Kacperczyk, Sialm, and Zheng (2008). We find that the funds holding the control firm
exhibit a return of 14.5 basis points over the three-days around the announcement. The
difference in the holdings returns including and excluding the control firm of 0.1 basis points
is much smaller than the corresponding difference of 7.8 basis points for the funds holding
the target stock. Interestingly, the small return difference of 0.1 basis points is statistically
significant, indicating that matched firms also appreciate slightly on the announcement day.
For the control funds, the reported fund return underperforms the holdings return including
the target by 2.1 basis points, indicating that trading costs exceed interim trading benefits.
In Panel B of Table 8, we explore the announcement effects in a regression framework.
We regress the three-day reported fund return in excess of the holdings return including the
target firm around the announcement day on the announcement effect and on the holdings
return including the target. The announcement effect is defined as the product of a fund’s
allocated portfolio weight to the target firm at the end of Q(t)−1 and the target’s three-day
return around the M&A announcement day. The holdings-based return including the target
is defined as the return of a fund holding the disclosed fund positions at the end of the prior
quarter, Q(t) − 1.
The coefficient on the announcement effect estimates the proportion of the target stock
that is sold prior to the M&A announcement. If all funds completely sell their holdings

20

of the target stock before the announcement, then the coefficient on the announcement
effect will be −1. However, if all funds continue to hold the target until after the M&A
announcement, then the coefficient on the announcement effect will be equal to zero.
The results in Panel B of Table 8 indicate that around one-third of mutual fund holdings
in the target are, on average, liquidated prior to the M&A announcement. Thus, the
liquidation behavior of mutual funds actually accelerates during the announcement quarter.
We repeat this analysis on the control firms and find that the results are in contrast to those
for target firms in that the coefficient on the announcement effect for the control firms is
insignificantly positive.
Our findings suggest that mutual funds are generally uninformed about forthcoming
M&A announcements. For hedge funds, possible drivers of their accumulation of the targets’ stock prior to the M&A announcements could be related to the possession of private
information, or superior managerial ability to identify to-be targets, or both. While we do
not take a particular stand on the mechanism behind this behavior, it appears that mutual funds, in the aggregate, “leave money on the table,” and hedge funds pick it up. Our
results provide a striking contrast between mutual funds and hedge funds with respect to
their trading behavior in to-be M&A targets.

3.8

Short Selling Activities

Institutional investors are only required to disclose their long positions in their 13F filings.
This restriction is particularly important for hedge funds, who frequently participate in
short selling. Ignoring short positions might result in misleading inferences if the long
positions by some investors are offset by the short positions by other investors of the same
type.
We examine short selling activity in targets and bidders prior to M&A announcements
using data from COMPUSTAT following Rapach, Ringgenberg, and Zhou (2016). The
aggregate amount of short selling is reported monthly in the middle of each calendar month.
For deals announced in the first half of a month (that is, before the short interest report),

21

we treat the short interest report one month prior to the M&A announcement month as a
report in month M (t) − 1. For deals announced after the short interest report is announced,
we treat the short interest report in the M&A announcement month as a report in month
M (t) − 1. We normalize the short selling by the number of shares outstanding on the
corresponding dates.
Although we do not know the identity of the short-sellers, it is likely that a substantial
fraction of short selling derives from hedge funds. Retail investors, and to a lesser extent,
mutual funds might also contribute to the short selling.
Table 9 reports the aggregate proportion of short positions as a proportion of shares
outstanding for targets and bidders. We do not find a significant increase in the proportion
of short selling in the target during the month prior to the public M&A announcement.
The increase in short selling in the target stock is slightly larger, but still insignificant, if
we consider a longer window. Since we do not uncover a decline in short selling prior to the
announcement, short sellers in the aggregate do not appear to be anticipating the M&A
announcement. The change in short selling before the M&A announcements is substantially
smaller than the change in the long positions of hedge funds over the same time period.
Thus, even if we attribute all the changes in short selling to hedge funds, we would still
observe an increase in net holdings of target companies by hedge funds in the months prior
to the announcement. We also find a slight increase in the short selling of the bidder
companies over several months prior to the announcement.
The changes in short selling in targets and bidders after the M&A announcement are
more pronounced than the changes prior to the announcement. We observe a decline in short
selling in target firms from 3.98% to 3.45% in the month of the takeover announcement.
Furthermore, we also find an increase in short selling in bidder firms from 3.28% to 3.75% in
the month of the takeover announcement. This increase in short selling for acquirers could
be due to the activities of merger arbitrageurs who go long the stock of the target and go
short the stock of the acquiring company immediately after the acquisition announcement.

22

3.9

Mutual Fund Affiliation with M&A Advisors

Fund management companies that serve as M&A advisors to targets and acquirers may
provide information about forthcoming deal announcements to their affiliated funds. We
therefore analyze trading by mutual funds whose management company serves as an M&A
advisor to targets or acquirers.
Growing evidence suggests that financial conglomerates may exploit their access to private information in various ways. Bodnaruk, Massa, and Simonov (2009), for example,
document that financial conglomerates in which affiliated investment banks advise acquirer
firms take positions in target companies before M&A deal announcements. Massa and
Rehman (2008) find that mutual fund managers increase their holdings in companies that
borrow from their affiliated banks. Jegadeesh and Tang (2010) also study institutional
trades around takeover announcements. They provide evidence that funds whose main broker is also a target advisor are net buyers of target shares before announcements and their
pre-announcement trades are significantly profitable.
In our sample, some mutual funds are affiliated with financial conglomerates that also
provide M&A advisory services. Out of the 1,926 funds in our sample, 1,901 have information about the identity of their affiliated management company. The target M&A advisor’s
identity is available for 6,527 (out of 7,184) deals, and the acquirer M&A advisor’s name
is available for about 67% of our sample offers (4,854 transactions). Some companies have
multiple M&A advisors. We identify funds affiliated with M&A advisors by name matching
and examine their ownership in to-be targets prior to deal announcements.
Table 10 reports the ownership of the target company by mutual funds whose management company advises M&A targets or acquirers. The funds affiliated with M&A target
advisors do not exhibit an increase in their ownership in the quarter immediately preceding
the merger announcement. However, over the three quarters prior to the merger announcement, their ownership in affiliated takeover targets increases by about 1.6 basis points. This
longer-term increase in ownership of target firms by affiliated advisors is not necessarily due
to trading based on private information. It could also occur because financial firms with
23

increasing mutual fund ownership stakes might be more likely to be selected as advisors by
potential takeover targets.
In contrast, the ownership in the target firm by funds that are affiliated with M&A
bidder advisors declines by about 1.4 basis points during the three quarters prior to the
deal announcement quarter. An indication that ownership changes are not driven by shortterm information about an upcoming takeover is provided by the fact that fund ownership
in an impending target does not change significantly in the quarter immediately prior to the
M&A announcement. This finding is consistent with those reported for all mutual funds in
our sample, as reported in Table 2.

3.10

Hedge Fund Activism

A number of studies provide evidence that hedge fund managers are able to influence corporate management and act as informed monitors. For example, Brav, Jiang, Partnoy,
and Thomas (2008) find a relatively large average abnormal return for a firm subject to
activism of about 7% over the period beginning 20 days prior to the filing of a Schedule
13D to 20 days after. Brav, Jiang, Partnoy, and Thomas (2008) document improvements
in the affected firms’ operating performance associated with hedge fund activism. Such
positive outcomes can be explained by activists’ intervention and the disciplinary mechanism imposed on the management of firms subject to activism. and Wu and Chung (2019)
also show that hedge fund activism increases shareholder wealth by forcing corporate M&A
to be more efficient and disciplined. In contrast, Greenwood and Schor (2009) argue that
most of the activism announcement returns are explained by activists’ ability to force activism firms into a takeover. Greenwood and Schor (2009) suggest that activists pursue
certain firms because they anticipate that those companies will soon be acquired. Gantchev
and Jotikasthira (2018) show that institutional sales raise a firm’s probability of becoming subject to activism and Boyson, Gantchev, and Shivdasani (2017) find that activist
interventions substantially increase the probability of a takeover offer.
While it is not straightforward to disentangle the drivers of the market reaction to

24

activism announcements, it is plausible that hedge fund activists influence corporate management decisions; and through this relation with a firm’s management, hedge fund may
have access to information that other market participants do not.
We explore this plausible channel between hedge funds and their holdings in activism
firms that become takeover targets. The expanded sample from Brav, Jiang, Partnoy, and
Thomas (2008) includes 4,058 activism-firm observations over the period 1994-2014 for the
sample of 663 unique hedge funds.14 The number of unique hedge funds in our sample is
1,162. After matching by fund name, we find that 114 out of 663 activists appear in our
sample of hedge funds. A total of 548 activism firms are held by these 114 activists. Out
of 548 firms subject to activism, 76 firms are also acquisition targets held by activists who
filed 13D during the 365-day period before the M&A announcement date.
We next examine the trading activity by activists in takeover targets prior to M&A
announcements. The first column of Table 11 reports the ownership for the identified
activists holding shares of all M&A target firms in our sample regardless of whether these
firms are subject to activism. Consistent with our baseline results for hedge funds reported
in Table 2, activists increase their ownership in M&A targets from 0.048% to 0.090% of
shares outstanding over the three quarters prior to deal announcements. The ownership
levels by activist hedge funds is very small since they only account for a small fraction of
hedge fund investors.
The second column reports hedge fund ownership for transactions excluding the activist
hedge funds. The findings in this subsample are consistent with the baseline results for all
hedge funds: the ownership by non-activist hedge funds also increases significantly in the
quarters prior to the M&A announcement. Thus, our baseline hedge fund results are not
primarily driven by this sample of activist hedge fund investors.
The third column of Table 11 includes hedge fund activist ownership in the 76 activism
14

We are grateful to Alon Brav, Wei Jiang, and Hyunseob Kim for sharing their data on hedge fund
activism between 1994 and 2014. By law, investors are required to file Schedule 13D within 10 days after
transactions that cause them to go over the 5% ownership threshold. Typically, crossing this 5% threshold
is aimed at pursuing activism by hedge funds.

25

firms that are also M&A targets held by funds who file a Schedule 13D within one year
before the merger announcement date. We observe a very significant increase in their
holdings from 6.59% to 11.57% during the three quarters before the M&A announcement.
Thus, activist hedge funds contribute to a significant increase in ownership in a relatively
small sample of firms targeted by activism.
The fourth column reports the percentage ownership in the 76 activism firms that are
also acquisition targets by non-activist hedge funds. Holdings in these firms by non-activist
hedge funds is fairly high and also increases gradually over time. Thus, non-activist hedge
funds might cooperate explicitly and implicitly with activist hedge funds in increasing ownership in firms targeted by hedge fund activism, as also discussed by Brav, Dasgupta, and
Mathews (2018), Kedia, Starks, and Wang (2016), and Apple, Gormley, and Keim (2018).
The last column reports the aggregate ownership by all hedge funds in the 76 activism
firms. In the small subset of firms that are both subject to activism and an M&A bid, the
increasing trend in hedge fund ownership prior to deal announcements is primarily driven
by activists’ trading.
The evidence in Table 11 shows that hedge fund activism is one of several possible
channels for value creation vis-a-vis their accumulation of ownership in eventual takeover
targets.

4

Cross-Sectional Evidence

In this section we study whether there are systematic differences in trading across mutual
funds around takeover announcements. Consequently, we transition in this section to fundlevel analyses. We focus in this section on the sample of domestic equity mutual funds, as
summarized in Panel B of Table 1.

26

4.1

Persistence

We explore whether this tendency of allocating higher (lower) portfolio weights to target
firms by mutual funds or hedge funds is persistent over time. If institutional investors
have an ability to identify takeover targets, then we should observe that they persistently
overweigh these companies. On the other hand, if they are just lucky to once hold a
high stake in a takeover target, then we should not observe that the same institutions will
continue to overweigh takeover targets in subsequent periods. To evaluate this, we sort all
mutual funds based on the total portfolio weights of holdings in one or more M&A targets
at the end of the quarter prior to the announcement quarter. The first group corresponds
to the funds that do not hold at the end of quarter Q(t) − 1 any companies that become
takeover targets in the subsequent quarter Q(t). The remaining three groups correspond
to terciles based on the weights invested at the end of quarter Q(t) − 1 in companies that
become takeover targets in the subsequent quarter. We then examine the portfolio weights
allocated to future target firms in the following four quarters. Every quarter we average
the proportional holdings in takeover companies across the funds within each group. In a
second step, we take the time-series average of the cross-sectional averages.
Panel A of Table 12 reports the average weights allocated to takeover targets by mutual
funds in the four groups formed at the end of quarter Q(t) − 1. In the formation period,
the lowest tercile with positive holdings exhibits a weight of 0.45%, whereas the highest
tercile exhibits a weight of 3.33% in to-be targets. Although we observe a mean reversion
in ownership weights, we detect significant persistence in the weights invested in takeover
targets across time. For example, mutual funds that do not own any takeover targets in the
prior quarter will only invest 0.49% of their portfolios in new takeover candidates in the next
quarter. In contrast, funds in the highest tercile of target ownership in the prior quarter
will invest 0.74% of their portfolios in new takeover targets in the subsequent quarter. We
compute the differences in average weights for the highest and lowest terciles, and report
Newey-West-adjusted t-statistics with a lag length of five quarters. This evidence suggests
that mutual funds dedicating higher portfolio weights to target firms announced in the next
27

quarter tend to allocate significantly higher weights to future M&A targets.
We perform similar tests on the hedge funds’ portfolio weights in to-be takeover targets.
The results are reported in Panel B of Table 12. Similar to the outcomes for the mutual fund
sample, we observe significant persistence in portfolio weights in takeover targets allocated
by hedge funds over an extended time period. For example, hedge funds that do not own
any takeover targets in the prior quarter will only invest 1.21% of their portfolios in new
takeover candidates in the next quarter, whereas funds in the highest tercile will invest
2.02% of their portfolios in new takeover targets in the subsequent quarter.
These results demonstrate that propensity to hold impending takeover targets is a persistent feature of their investment strategies of mutual funds and hedge funds and not simply
the result of lucky draws.

4.2

Fund Activeness

The activeness of mutual funds has been associated with positive investment ability (e.g.,
Kacperczyk, Sialm, and Zheng (2008), Cremers and Petajisto (2009), Amihud and Goyenko
(2013)). Funds need to deviate from their benchmarks to be able to outperform these
benchmarks. In this section, we explore whether trading in takeover targets depends on the
activeness of mutual fund managers.
We consider several measures of mutual fund activeness. First, we use the Active Share
measure proposed by Cremers and Petajisto (2009). Active Share is computed as the
share of portfolio positions that differ from the benchmark index holdings. We follow the
methodology of Amihud and Goyenko (2013) and construct the second measure of stockselectivity, Fund (1 − R2 ). The R2 comes from four-factor regressions using the previous 36
monthly return observations. Since a lower R2 is indicative of greater investment ability,
we subtract its value from one for easier comparability with the other activeness measures.
Our third measure of activeness is the absolute value of the Return Gap, proposed by
Kacperczyk, Sialm, and Zheng (2008). This measure is the difference between the reported
fund return and the return on the portfolio that consists of previously disclosed holdings.

28

For each target, we merge all funds in the sample that exist at the time of the deal
announcement. We repeat this procedure with the control firms, and integrate the two
datasets. The unit of observation is at the fund-firm level, where firm refers to either a
target company or its corresponding control firm. The control group is obtained from the
procedure described in Table 3. The T arget f irm indicator variable equals one if a firm
is a takeover target, and is zero if a firm is a corresponding control group company. The
dependent variable is a fund’s difference in log(1 + sharesQ(t)−1 ) and log(1 + sharesQ(t)−2 ),
given that Q(t) is the announcement quarter. If a fund does not hold a potential target
(or a firm from the control group), its number of adjusted shares is zero. The independent
variable of interest is the interaction term between activeness measures and a target firm
dummy. Other independent variables include fund and firm characteristics.
Table 13 reports the results. We find a strong positive relation between the change in
fund ownership in takeover targets prior to M&A announcements and the three measures
of fund activeness. Consistent with the base-case specification in Table 2, we find that the
holdings of impending target firms decrease in the quarter prior to the announcement. This
decline is significantly less pronounced for funds that exhibit a higher level of activeness.
This evidence suggests that more active mutual funds do not decrease their stake in tobe targets as much as other mutual funds do. The cross-sectional differences in holdings
adjustments of target firms are also economically substantial. For example, a mutual fund
with a mean level of Active Share (i.e., 0.814 according to Table 1B) tends to reduce
positions in to-be target stocks by around 0.88 basis points in the quarter before the M&A
announcement (i.e., (0.247 × 0.814 − 0.289)/1000 = −0.88bp). In contrast a fund with a
one-standard deviation higher active share than the mean fund tends to reduce positions
in to-be target stocks by only 0.48 basis points prior to the announcement (i.e., (0.247 ×
(0.814+0.160)−0.289)/1000 = −0.48bp).15 Even though the mutual fund sector, as a whole,
15

The average decrease in target stocks for an average fund is small because few individual mutual funds
actually hold the target stock in the quarter prior to the announcement. Furthermore, the difference log(1 +
sharesQ(t)−1 ) − log(1 + sharesQ(t)−2 ) does not exactly correspond to the log-change in number of shares
since we add one to the number of shares. However, the difference corresponds closely to the log-change if
a fund holds a significant number of shares in both periods.

significantly decreases their holdings in targets prior to deal announcement, more activelymanaged funds appear to be either better informed or more skillful to predict takeover
targets than more passively-managed funds.
These results show that less active funds are most likely to sell impending target candidates prior to the public announcement of an M&A transactions. Consistent with the prior
literature, we find that the mutual funds exhibiting high activeness are more skilled and its
trading strategies around merger announcements correspond more closely to the strategies
of hedge funds.

Conclusion

We analyze the holdings of institutional investors around takeover announcements to better understand the investment strategies of institutions facing different regulatory environments, compensation policies, and investment restrictions. We find that while mutual funds
generally reduce their exposure to takeover candidates in the quarters prior to the merger
announcement, hedge funds increase it. Overall, our results suggest that mutual fund managers are generally uninformed about future M&A deals. In contrast, either due to better
information about an impending merger or superior ability in identifying takeover targets,
hedge funds are more likely than mutual funds to benefit from their ownership in target
firms during M&A transactions.

Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CARs) around M&As

This figure illustrates the evolution of the equal-weighted average cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) P
around merger announcements. We calculate cumulative abnormal
returns as CARij = tj=1 (rij − rmj ), where rij is a firm’s i’s return and rmj is the CRSP
value-weighted market return at time j. To mitigate the effect of delisting on CARs after
announcements, we set abnormal returns of delisted targets to zero.

These figures illustrate the evolution of the mutual and hedge fund ownership in acquisition targets around M&A announcements. We sum up all shares held by mutual funds
(hedge funds) for each company in each quarter. We then obtain aggregate ownership by
dividing the summed shares held by total shares outstanding. Panel A displays the average

Table 2: Mutual fund and hedge fund ownership in takeover targets
Panel A of this table reports the average mutual fund and hedge fund ownership (in %) and changes in
ownership in takeover targets around M&A announcements. We denote Q(t) as the merger announcement
quarter. Mutual (hedge) fund ownership is the total number of shares held by mutual (hedge) funds in our
sample as a fraction of total shares outstanding. Panel B reports the average number of mutual funds and
hedge funds that hold a takeover firm. If none of mutual (hedge) funds in our sample hold a target firm,
this number, as well as the percent ownership, is set to 0. Standard errors are clustered at the quarter level.
The t-statistics are shown in parentheses. Symbols ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1%,
5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 3: Mutual fund and hedge fund ownership in takeover targets and control group firms
This table reports the average mutual fund and hedge fund ownership (in %) and changes in ownership
in takeover targets and control group firms around M&A announcements. We denote Q(t) as the merger
announcement quarter. Mutual (hedge) fund ownership is the total number of shares held by mutual (hedge)
funds in our sample as a fraction of total shares outstanding. We match our sample of targets based on
the Fama-French 48 industry classification and time, and obtain all firms with book-to-market and market
capitalization between 0.5x and 2x of that of the target firm at Q(t) − 4. We also eliminate self-matches
and other companies that become takeover targets in any of the six quarters Q(t) − 4, Q(t) − 3, Q(t) − 2,
Q(t) − 1, Q(t), and Q(t) + 1. We require non-missing total shares outstanding in four quarters prior to and
in the announcement quarter. If there are multiple candidates, we pick the firm with the closest market
capitalization to that of the target firm. This results in 6,259 matches. Standard errors are clustered at
the quarter level. The t-statistics are shown in parentheses. Symbols ***, **, and * indicate statistical
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 4: Linear probability model of takeover decisions
This table reports the linear probability regression results relating mutual and hedge fund ownership levels
and changes with the probability of a firm becoming a takeover target. We use all firms in CRSP for the
period 1990-2015 as the universe of stocks. We run the linear probability model with a dependent variable
equal to 1 if a firm is a takeover target, and 0 otherwise. The key explanatory variables are the mutual fund
(MF) and hedge fund (HF) ownership in levels and changes. To obtain the aggregate ownership by mutual
(hedge) funds, we sum up all shares held by mutual (hedge) funds and divide by total shares outstanding
(TSO). Other controls include the natural logarithm of market capitalization, the market-to-book ratio, and
the one-year return. All continuous variables are winsorized at the 1% level. Standard errors are clustered at
the quarter level. p-values are reported in parentheses. Symbols ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance
at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 5: Mutual fund and hedge fund ownership in takeover targets by subperiods
This table reports mutual fund and hedge fund ownership in target firms during the period of 1990-2000
(before Regulation Fair Disclosure) and during the period of 2001-2015 (after this regulatory change). We
denote Q(t) as the merger announcement quarter. Mutual (hedge) fund ownership is the total number of
shares held by mutual (hedge) funds in our sample as a fraction of total shares outstanding. Standard errors
are clustered at the quarter level. The t-statistics are shown in parentheses. Symbols ***, **, and * indicate

Table 7: Mutual fund and hedge fund ownership in takeover targets by announcement timing
This table reports the average mutual fund and hedge fund ownership (in %) for the target firms sorted
based on the timing of the deal announcement during the event quarter. The first two columns report the
average ownership in takeover targets associated with the deals announced in the first 20 calendar days of
the announcement quarter. The middle two columns report the average fund ownership in targets associated
with the deals announced in the last 20 days of the event quarter, and the last two columns show these
statistics for the remaining deals. We denote Q(t) as the merger announcement quarter. Mutual (hedge)
fund ownership is the total number of shares held by mutual (hedge) funds in our sample as a fraction
of total shares outstanding. Standard errors are clustered at the quarter level. The t-statistics are shown
in parentheses. Symbols ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels,

Table 8: Tests with daily mutual fund returns
Conditional on fund ownership of target at Q(t) − 1, we compare the actual (i.e., reported) fund return with
the holdings-based return including and excluding the target stock over a three-day window around the
announcement. When the target firm is excluded, we rebalance the portfolio proportionally. The holdingsbased-return is calculated as the value-weighted average three-day return across various asset classes of the
portfolio composition. For each fund at Q(t) − 1, we obtain the percent of a portfolio allocated to equities,
cash, and bonds/preferred stocks from the CRSP fund summary file. The return on the equity part of the
portfolio is based on mutual fund holdings at Q(t) − 1 and is obtained by multiplying the stock weight by
the corresponding three-day stock return around the deal announcement date, and summing these products
at the portfolio level. We proxy for the cash and bond/preferred stock returns using published indices. For
bonds and preferred stocks, we use the total return of the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index,
while for cash holdings we use the one-month Treasury bill rate. We adjust the holdings-based returns for
the three-day expense ratio, obtained by dividing the annual fund expense ratio into 250 and multiplying by
3. Panel A reports these returns for both the treatment and control groups. The control group is obtained
following the methodology described in Table 3, and the analysis is also conditional on fund ownership of
control firm at Q(t) − 1. Standard errors are clustered at the quarter level. We explore the announcement
effects in a regression framework in Panel B. The dependent variable is the reported three-day fund return
around the deal announcement minus the fund’s holdings return including the target. The announcement
effect is defined as a product of a fund’s allocated portfolio weight to the target firm at the end of Q(t) − 1
and the three-day target’s return around the announcement day. Similarly, we define the announcement
effect for the control group. The standard errors in both regressions are clustered at the quarter level. The
t-statistics are shown in parentheses. Symbols ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%,
and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 9: Short selling of targets and acquirers prior to M&A announcements
We examine the short selling activity of targets and acquirers around M&A announcements. This table
reports the percentage of shares shorted between six months prior and the M&A announcement month,
M (t). The report with shares held short is published in the middle of each month. For deals announced
in the first half of a month (that is, before the short interest report), we treat the short interest report
one month prior to the M&A announcement month as a report in month M (t) − 1. For deals announced
after the short interest report is published, we treat the short interest report in the M&A announcement
month as a report in month M (t) − 1. Standard errors are clustered at the quarter level. The t-statistics
are shown in parentheses. Symbols ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10%
levels, respectively.

Table 12: Persistence in mutual fund and hedge fund weights
We sort all mutual funds based on the total portfolio weights of holdings in M&A targets at the end of the
quarter prior to the announcement quarter. The first group corresponds to funds which do not own any
M&A target stocks at the end of Q(t) − 1. The remaining funds that own at least one M&A target stock are
divided into terciles based on the weight invested in target stocks at the end of Q(t) − 1. We compute their
portfolio weights in future to-be targets in subsequent quarters between Q(t) and Q(t) + 3. Panel A reports
average weights allocated to to-be targets by mutual funds in each group formed in Q(t) − 1. Following
this approach, we report average weights allocated to future takeover targets by hedge funds in Panel B.
We calculate the differences in average weights for the highest and lowest terciles, and report Newey-Westadjusted t-statistics. Symbols ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels,
respectively.

Table 13: Mutual fund trading in takeover targets and fund activeness
This table shows the relation between trading targets and fund activeness. For each target, we merge all
funds in the sample that exist at the time of the deal announcement. We repeat this procedure with the
control group firms, and integrate the obtained two datasets. The unit of observation is fund-firm level,
where firm refers to either a target company or its corresponding control group firm. The control group
is obtained from the precedure described in Table 3. T arget f irm equals 1 if a firm is a takeover target,
and is 0 if a firm is a corresponding control group company. The dependent variable is a fund’s difference
in log(1 + sharesQ(t)−1 ) and log(1 + sharesQ(t)−2 ), given that Q(t) is the announcement quarter. If a
fund does not hold a potential target (or a firm from the control group), its number of adjusted shares
is 0. A vector of controls consists of firm and fund characteristics: a fund’s TNA, a fund’s age, a fund’s
expense ratio, a fund’s turnover ratio, a fund’s flows, a firm’s market capitalization, a firm’s stock return
in quarter (t − 1) and its stock return in (t − 2), as well as a firm’s stock turnover ratio. The activeness
variable is either Active Share (Model (1)), Fund (1-R2 ) (Model (2)), or the absolute value of Return
Gap (Model (3)). Since Active Share data is annual, for each fund×quarter observation, we take Active
Share of a fund for the year preceding the merger announcement year. All independent variables (except
Active Share) are measured as of quarter Q(t) − 2, plus a firm’s stock return that is measured at Q(t) − 1.
In model (1), Active Share is measured as of year before the merger announcement year. All continuous
variables are winsorized at the 1% level. Standard errors are clustered at the fund level. All coefficients are
multiplied by 1,000. t-statistics are reported in parentheses. Symbols ***, **, and * indicate statistical
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.
