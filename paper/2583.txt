May 1988

Endogenous Participation in Agricultural Support Programs and
Ad Valoreim Equivalent Modelling

ABSTRACT

This paper argues that a price wedge treatment of

agricultural surports can seriously misrepresent their welfare
and quantity effects.

We make our point by focusing on pre-1985

US wheat programs, but features of programs in many other

countries lead to comparable problems with the ad valorem
approach.

This line of argument raises questions over the

current approach in the multilateral trade negotiations of
negotiating on producer subsidy equivalents (PSEs)

or some other

subsidy-like measure.

Introduction
Numerical models of the effects of domestic agricultural support

programs usually treat them

as

subsidizing production, in effect introducing a

series of ad valorem distortions or price "wedges" between foreign and
domestic prices.2 The

purpose

of this paper is to argue that a price wedge

treatment of agricultural supports can seriously misrepresent their welfare
and quantity effects.

We make our point by focusing on pre—1985 US wheat

programs3, but features of programs in many other countries lead to comparable
problems with the ad valorem approach.4

This line of argument raises

questions over the current approach in the multilateral trade negotiations of
negotiating on producer subsidy equivalents (PSEs), or some other subsidy—like
measure.
The essence of the argument in the US wheat case is that since cossnodity

programs are voluntary, producers who receive deficiency payments must also
comply with acreage limitations.

Farms who are already participating

same

tine,

in

But at the

farms will be encouraged to enter the

program if price supports increase, and they will set aside land which was
previously in use.

Thus, rather than simply subsidizing output, the program

as a whole nay have production incentive or disincentive effects, depending on
the relative strength of the price effects for farms already participating,
and the land set—aside effects for new program participants.

It is, therefore, misleading to represent these programs as equivalent
to an ad valorem subsidy which unambiguously increases output, as is done in
price wedge models.

The welfare costs of support programs will be mismeasured

by an approach using an ad valorem treatment, since the resources idled as a

2

result of the set—asides are not explicitly modelled.

Whet is needed to

capture the effects of programs on output and welfare is to explicitly model
the program participation

decision of fames.

Generating unambiguous analytical results from models with set—asides
and endogenous participation

decisions is something that the existing

literature has been unable to do.

We use a numerical general equilibrium model0 in which set—asides are
explicitly modelled,

along with endogenous participation decisions of farms.

We use data for 1981 to which we calibrate the model,

This allows ua to

analyze the joint impact of US price supports and set—aaidea on US wheat
output, and calculate the social coat of these programs.
Our numerical results show, in contraat to what ia predicted by
conventional price wedge models, that removing price aupporta for wheat given
1981 program characteristics

reduces rather than increases output, because of

the impact on participation decisions and aasociated set aaidea.

Comparing

our welfare evaluations of the aociai cost of program supports to those
obtained using the same data in a traditional "price wedge" model, shows that
resuits are sharply different.

Given the program parameters P end A, end knowing the market price

optimal yields and input demands under participation

and non—participation.

This allows for a comparison of the two profit functions (3) and (4), and a
determination of the participation decision.

This, in turn, allows input

demands and outputs to be calculated.

Whether farms choose to participate in any configuration of program
supports and set asides depen's on the level of program supports, the way
marginal cost functions change as land is idled to comply with set asides, and
the lump sum costs that set aside requirements cause.

We assume that the

elasticity of substitution between inputs across farms is uniformly
distributed over a pre—specified

interval.

Farms with higher elasticities of

substitution have higher average yields, and, given that land is a fixed
factor for each farm, these farms have more shallowly sloped marginal cost
functions.

The parameter values we use in the model along with the data to

which the model is calibrated, imply that low elasticity (high yield) farms
participate in program support, while high elasticity farms do not.

The Remainder of the Model
As indicated above, this treatment of the US wheat sector has been
introduced into a multi—country

general equilibrium structure of the global

grain market, used by Trela et al. (1987) to analyze the effects of global

policy interventions in grains.

This model uses the same ad valorem

equivalent approach which we criticize here, and our modification of the
earlier treatment of the US is aimed at highlighting the pitfalls of ad
valorem modelling that we discuss above.

Also, proceeding in this way allows

comparisons between the approach used here, and a more conventional "price
wedge" approach to be made for comparable data.

Thirteen countries or blocs10 of countries are identified in this
earlier model, with wheat and other goods as the only produced consuodities.
Demands in each region are based on utility maximizing behaviour with a single

10

national consumer assumed who receives all the income originating in the
country.

This consumer faces domestic consumer pricea in making

consumption decisions, but the country as a whole satisfies trade
balance at world prices, i.e.:

Distortions in the wheat sector in these countries are modelled in ad valorem

between producer end consumer prices within the country.

In the present modified model, a OFT function is used in the US to
describe the economy's production possibilities for other goods (Xp ) and

Solution cf

the

Model

The equilibrium structure of this extended model involves three prices;
those for wheat, other goods, and non—land inputs into wheat production in the
US.

There are three associated market excess demand functions.

The first two

prices affect behaviour in all regions captured in the model, including the
US, the third price only affects behaviour in the US component of the model.

In regions other than the US, the relative price of wheat in terms of
other goods, along with the ad valorem domestic subsidies or taxes allows
production and consumption of these two goods to be calculated using the first
order conditions for utility and profit maximizing behaviour.

(nowing

producer prices in the country (given by world prices gross of any distortions

at producer level), a tangency to the production frontier can be found.

The

country will then trade along a world price line, such that a tangency of an
indifference curve and a domestic price line is found on the world price line
through the production point,

Solving for production and consumption

behaviour in this way implies the net trades for each region in wheat and
other goods.
In the case of the US, information on the prices of non—land inputs into
wheat and other goods allows outputs of these two goods in the US to be
determined from the first order conditions from profit maximization subject to

the value of production of other goods and non-land inputs, and the return to

land for all farm types, allows aggregate income and hence US demands for
other goods and wheat, to be etermined.

Aggregating across the US and all the other countries or regions in the
node! yields the market demands for wheat and other goods.

Summing production

across all countries yields total supply, and hence excess demand for wheat
and other goods.

The third excess demand is given by the difference between

the demand for non—land inputs into wheat summed across all farm types, and
output of

The model thus generates a system of three excess demands involving
three prices.

The global

of the model has been calibrated to the 1981 data set using the

inverse function method outlined in Mansur and Whalley (1984).

This involves

solving for values of share and scale parameters in the CES and CET functions

so as to produce data on quantities demanded and produced as solutions to
optimising behaviour at 1981 equilibrium prices.

the extent to which a 1 percent acreage reduction in the program due, say, to

Slippage reflects the response of farmers to a

number of substitution margins in response to set aside requirements.

These

include more intensive use of remaining land, setting aside the least

productive of the land they have available for cuitivation, end planting all
land and then subsequently plowing under the least productive

are large, emphasizing ti-ia point we make in the introduction to our paper,
that ad valorem equivalent modelling of the effects of these programs can be
highly misleading.

We also explore the sensitivity of model resuico to

elasticity values and other parameters.

Secsuse of the sharp escalation of program supports in recent years, we
have chosen to dramatize our model results by using the escimates of ad
valorem equivalent for wheat support programs represented as the producer
subsidy equivalent (P5K), reported in recent USDA publication (1987) rather
than the actual levels of program supports for 1981 in our nicroconsistent

though our earlier discussion suggests the net effect of commodity programs is

This is because of the offsetting effects of set—aside

With the programs modelled explicitly, as in earlier sections, the
results could hardly be more different.

This is shown in Table 3.

When

modelled as ad valorem subsidies, eliminating the programs causes US output to
fall and the world price to rise.

When the policies are explicitlymodelled

to capture changing participation decisions and acreage set asides, the

opposite result occurs.

Our estimated PSE is low, and increasing it to the

middle of the range suggested by the USDA5 calculations would only serve to
increase the disparity in results between the two approaches.

Under explicit program modelling, output rises when programs are
abolished because the increase in production

from the extra acreage planted

more than offsets the fall in production due to the decrease in prices
received by producers originally in the program.

Summary and Conclusions

This paper stresses the pitfalls involved in modelling domestic
agricultural support programs in ad vaiorem equivalent form, illustrating how
in the use of US commodity programs for wheat, payments to producers who

participate in programs are linked to non—marginal reductions in total acreage
planted.

High support prices which might appear to subsidize production can

thus also increase participation in support programs cutting acreage planted,
and potentially reducing output.

Ad valorem modelling will miss these effects.

in periods when price supports (and loan rates) have been high, such as
in the late 1970s, a sharp growth in stockpiles of wheat and feed grains
has occurred.

Further policies beyond acreage reductions have then been
