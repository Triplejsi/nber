The Role of Export Subsidies When Product Quality Is Unknown

as a signal of quality, a role for export subsidies can arise. In
particular, we show that absent export subsidies, entry of high quality
firms may be blocked by their inability to sell at prices reflecting
their true quality. Export subsidies enable high quality producers to
begin exporting profitably even while unable to credibly convey their
high quality to consumers in the "introductory" period. Thus, in
breaking the entry barrier for high quality firms, export subsidies can
raise average quality in the merket and a welfare—improving role for
export subsidies emerges. Moreover, even when high quality firms find
it possible to signal their high quality to consumers through an
introductory pricing strategy, a role for government policy can arise:

These models share the

characteristic that the subsidy—induced terms—of—trade loss in one
market is offset by

a

terms—of—trade gain in another, raising the

possibility of national benefit from a policy of export subsidization.
Another body of literature, as reviewed by Brander (1986), has focused
primarily on the role of export

subsidies

as a means to 'enhance the

strategic position of domestic firms engaged in competition for world
markets with foreign rivals" (p. 26).

This 'profit—shifting" motive has

been the subject of a large number of recent

articles.

We explore in this pacer a different motive for export subsidies,
based on the notion that goods arriving from foreign countries may
initially be of unknown quality to domestic consumers, who learn about
their quality only through consumption.

Nelson (1970) refers to goods

whose cuality can be known only after they have

even when high

firms find it possible to signal their high

quality to consumers through an introductory pricing strategy, a role
for government policy can arise:

the signal (low introductory price)

represents a transfer of surplus from foreign producers to domestic
consumers which, as we show below, can be avoided with an appropriate
export tax/subsidy policy.
Tn one respect, the role played by export subsidies in the
presence of uninformed consumers bears a fundamental resemblance to the
profit—shifting motive noted above:

are quite different:

In another respect, however, the two policies

while profit—shifting (end terms—of—trade

shiftins) subsidies are beggar—thy—neighbor policies, the export
subsidies explored in this paper are oareto improving.

As such, the

implications that emerge for an appropriate domestic policy response to
export subsidies differ merkedly from those of the crofit—shifting and
terms—of—trade shifting models.
After developing the basic model in section II, we consider the
effect of export subsidies in section III.

The Pole of rxoort Subsidies

In this section, we establish three basic results.

First, in the

absence of export subsidies, high quality firms may be unable to find
buyers In the domestic market.

Incomplete information about quality can

therefore act as a barrier to welfare ImprovIng exports.

Moreover, this

barrier emerges even though fixed costs of production and competition
from incumbent producers in the domestic country are absent

the high

quality firms are unsuccessful because they cannot distinguish
themselves from low quality firms.

Second, with no private information

about firm quality but with the ability to precommit to a tax/subsidy
program over the two—period life of the firm, the foreign government can
increase foreign welfare by undertaking an export tax/subsidy program
which supports a separating equilibrium with only high quality firms
exporting.

Thus, as in the rent—shifting export subsidy literature, the

ability of governments to precommit where firms are unable to do so can
provide a rationale for government intervention.

Third, even in the

absence of the ability to precommit to 8 two—period policy, the foreign
government may be able to raise foreign welfare from its no—export level
(and leave domestic welfare unchanged) with an export subsidy in the

The notion that a governsent program of export subsidies can raise

Extensions

Tn this section we extend the basic model of section II in several
directions,

First we explore the role of export subsidies in the

presence of several potential export goods when oualities are correlated
across markets,

We then relax the assumption of a oassive domestic

government, and consider its response to the ezport policies of the
foreign country.

The one case in which the program of Theorem 2 will be a beggarthy—neighbor policy is when separation would have occurred without
intervention, Here the program is simply a first oeriod export
tax, and involves no export subsidy.
A different interpretation, suggested to us by Dani Rodrik, is
that high quality producers fail to internalize the post1ve
externality of their sales on the profits of low ouslity
producers. The export subsidy is then viewed as a way of
externality.
