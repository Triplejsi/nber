Military Service and Public Sector Employment: Birthdates Called in the Vietnam Draft Lotteries
Appear Excessively in the Population of Civilian U.S. Federal Personnel Records

ABSTRACT
Since at least T.H. Marshall, scholars have recognized military service as a form of sacrifice that
warrants compensation from the state. Indeed, some see the very genesis of the modern welfare
state as compensation for wartime sacrifice. War-widow pensions, expansion of the franchise, and
subsidized higher education are all examples of rights and benefits “bestowed” in return for
wartime mobilization. Similarly, in the U.S., governments have hired veterans preferentially for
civilian public jobs as recompense for active military service. Although oft-overlooked, those
policies appear influential: the percent of job holders identifying as veterans in the civilian U.S.
executive branch exceeds the proportion in the wider population by several multiples. This
century-old pattern suggests a significant means by which wartime mobilization has influenced
the state. Yet efforts to understand it have struggled to rule out the possibility that those who
serve in the armed forces are predisposed to work for the state in both military and civilian
capacities (for example, preferring the stability of government employment). Here we rule out
this possibility by examining whether birthdates randomly called for induction in the Vietnam-Era
Selective Service Lotteries (VSSL) appear disproportionately in the population of non-sensitive
personnel records of the civilian U.S. executive branch. We find that birthdates called for
induction appear with unusually high frequency among employees who were draft eligible and at
risk of induction, but not among other employees. This finding suggests a treatment effect from
military service, thus dovetailing with the hypothesis that wartime mobilization has substantially
and continually influenced who works in the contemporary administrative state.

Introduction
Research argues that early states emerged from efforts to muster resources for war (Tilly,
1990), and the modern welfare state shares a similar origin. At least since T.H. Marshall (1950)
identified wartime sacrifice as a basis for making claims upon the state, scholars have
documented how states have extended rights, privileges, and subsidies both to encourage
wartime sacrifice (Levi, 1997; Ferejohn and Rosenbluth, 2017) and compensate for it (Skocpol,
1992). Expansion of the franchise (Ferejohn and Rosenbluth, 2017), commitments to procedural
fairness (Levi, 1997), pensions for war widows (Skocpol, 1992), and subsidized higher education
(Mettler, 2005), to name a few examples, all reflect state efforts to elicit or reward sacrifice in
times of war. Together, these mechanisms of compensation formed the modern welfare state, and
their amplification in recent decades for military personnel and their families has transformed the
armed forces into an enterprise with both martial and welfare purposes (Gifford, 2006).
Yet, while these policies had a foundational role in the formation of the contemporary
welfare state, an often-ignored form of compensation for military sacrifice may continue to shape
the contemporary state. For over a century, the U.S. federal government and various state
governments have hired military veterans preferentially for public jobs (Lewis, 2013; Johnson,
2015). These policies echo similar practices in early states (Gorski, 1993; Kiser and Cai, 2003;
Johnson, 2017) and research claims that these policies explain why veterans staff over 25% of
U.S. executive-branch positions, despite constituting less than 10% of the U.S. population
(Lewis, 2013; Lewis, 2016). Such figures suggest a marked, continual influence of wartime
compensation on the state: compensation for military participation may open a path to civilian
public service that veterans are particularly inclined to traverse. Indeed, evidence indicates that
federal government jobs offer a wage premium (Belman and Heywood, 2004); thus, with

1

preferential hiring in place, military service amounts to the assignment of a voucher giving
greater access to a desirable asset.
The over-representation of military veterans among civilian employees of the government
also may stem from the bundle of treatment effects that military service potentially assigns to job
seekers. For instance, veterans might acclimate to the organizational structure of the military,
which shares features with the civilian public bureaucracy, thus making them even more inclined
to take advantage of the opportunities made available via preferential hiring (Johnson, 2015).
Perhaps less optimistically, veterans might lack experience in the civilian labor market, thus
impeding their efforts to find private-sector work and causing them to gravitate toward public
jobs in which preferential hiring compensates for their lack of civilian labor market experience.
Military service might increase patriotism, thus inspiring civilian public service after discharge.
Any one of these mechanisms might underlie the effect of military service—which is indelibly
linked with the receipt of federal preferential hiring benefits—on entry into public employment.
Estimating such treatment effects of military service on choice of employment sector is
complicated by selection dynamics. Namely, those who serve in the armed forces might be
predisposed to enter both military and civilian public service. For instance, they might prefer the
comparative stability of public employment, or exhibit consistently high levels of patriotism
throughout their lives, or possess a taste for working in large enterprises. That is, veterans’ rates
of entry into public jobs might merely reflect confounding, not the effect of military service and
the eligibility for preferential hiring that is linked with it. Accordingly, to understand how the
assignment of military service in the presence of preferential hiring influences entry into the
executive branch and, thus, to gain insight into the way that wartime mobilization might continue
to affect the state, research must eliminate possible confounders and examine how exogenous
2

variation in military service affects the ranks of the civilian public service. If exogenously
assigned military service does not co-vary with entry into public employment, then pre-service
factors—not military service in the presence of preferential hiring—likely drive veterans toward
public jobs.
Existing evidence, indeed, is inconsistent in its assessment of whether exogenous
variation in military service affects the likelihood of subsequent public employment. Angrist and
Chen (2011)—in a study of the late-life, labor-market experiences of men eligible for the
Vietnam-Era Selective Service Lotteries (VSSL)—discovered that men’s chances of working in
the public sector increased with their risk of military induction thanks to having their draft
number called. Green et al. (2018), on the other hand, in a study of whether the VSSL shaped
draftees’ political attitudes, found—in a separate sample—that the estimated effect of lotteryinduced military service on public-sector employment was smaller than its standard error—i.e. a
“null” effect. Unfortunately, the different methods of each study—an instrumental variable
analysis (Angrist and Chen, 2011) and an intent-to-treat analysis (Green et al. 2018)—prevent
direct comparison of the studies’ discrepant effect estimates. Furthermore, both studies
investigate a sample, thus their divergent findings could be attributable merely to sampling error:
chance sampling variation could result in data sets that, say, over- or underrepresent study
participants from geographical areas with more generous (or less generous) state and local
preferential hiring policies. Also, by grouping federal and lower-level employment into the same
indicator of public employment, these studies mask potentially heterogeneous treatment effects
that result from the systematic variation in treatment dosage across governmental jurisdictions.
The study we report in this paper overcomes these problems by studying the population
of data for one level of government that is subject to a single set of preferential hiring policies.
3

Specifically, the study examines whether birthdates called for induction in the Vietnam Selective
Service Lotteries appear with disproportionately high frequency in the population of U.S.
executive branch employees who were draft-eligible and at risk of induction. This analysis tests
whether the assignment of military service increases rates of entry into federal jobs, thus
shedding light on whether wartime mobilization not only played an important role in forming the
state, but also continuously shaped it by populating its ranks.

Methods
The VSSL provides an exogenous source of variation in draft-eligible men’s risk of
military service (Berinsky and Chatfield, 2015). We parrot past studies’ description of the VSSL
here (see Johnson et al., 2018, fn.6). In the VSSL, the U.S. Selective Service System printed
calendar dates on paper strips, placed the strips in small pods, put these pods in a receptacle, and
drew pods one-by-one, assigning numbers sequentially to each month-day combination until all
received numbers. These “Random Sequence Numbers” (RSNs) identified when draft-eligible
men reported for military induction in the following year. Men with RSN 1 reported first, those
with RSN 2 reported second, and this process continued until the RSN reached the year’s
“Administrative Processing Number” (APN). The APN was set before induction; it equaled 195
for the 1969 lottery, 125 in the second year, and 95 every year until 1975’s final lottery. After the
VSSL’s first three years, numbers were assigned, but not called.
Knowing these procedures, one of the authors (TJ) filed a Freedom of Information Act
request with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for all birthdates in the Central
Personnel Data File (CPDF)—the population of official personnel data for nondefense and nonpostal agencies of the U.S. federal executive branch. These data include all employees, whether

4

they work a full-time or part-time schedule, across all agencies and occupations included in the
CPDF. Officials at OPM supplied a count of the total number of males and females, respectively,
holding each birthdate in the monthly-archived population of personnel data from June 2011 (the
first month in which full birthdates were systematically collected) to March 2016 (the mostrecent month of data available at the time of the request). Rare birthdates held by less than five
employees had their counts set to zero to protect employee privacy, but no such birthdates
appeared in the data studied in the analyses we report below. The time period of the data make
them roughly comparable to those of Angrist and Chen (2011) and Green et al. (2018), which
both reported the effect of the VSSL on later-life public employment. Given that this time period
extends decades beyond the VSSL, estimates from our research design inevitably reflect patterns
of retirement and mortality caused by draft-eligible men’s lottery numbers. However, due to our
study’s aim of examining the lasting effect of military service on the administrative state, such
effects should be a part of our estimation: if low lottery numbers drove individuals to work in the
federal government later into their lives or to retire earlier than their colleagues with high lottery
numbers, then those phenomena ultimately shaped how military service affected employment in
the federal government over the long term, which is the phenomenon we seek to understand.
We subset the data to include birthdates from 1950-1956, thereby focusing exclusively on
birth cohorts turning 19-years old during the VSSL, as is deemed best practice (see Angrist,
1990). To study these data, we used the research design of Conley and Heerwig (2012). We
calculated 𝑃𝑆,𝑡 —that is, the proportion of employees, P, identifying with sex, S, born in year, t,
whose birthdates were assigned an RSN ≤ APN. If the VSSL influenced entry into civilian
executive-branch employment, one would expect: 𝑃𝑀,1950 > 𝑃𝐹,1950, 𝑃𝑀,1951 > 𝑃𝐹,1951 , and
𝑃𝑀,1952 > 𝑃𝐹,1952 . Moreover, given that no numbers were called after 1952, one would also
5

expect: 𝑃𝑀,1953 ≅ 𝑃𝐹,1953 , 𝑃𝑀,1954 ≅ 𝑃𝐹,1954 , 𝑃𝑀,1955 ≅ 𝑃𝐹,1955 , and 𝑃𝑀,1956 ≅ 𝑃𝐹,1956 . As an
additional counterfactual, we calculated 𝑃𝐸,𝑡 —that is, the theoretically-expected proportion of
employees holding birthdates assigned an RSN ≤ APN, for either sex, E, in year, t, if birthdates
are uniformly distributed across the year (see Conley and Heerwig, 2012). For instance,
𝑃𝐸,1950 =195/365=0.5328 because 1950 had 365 possible birthdates (it was not a leap year) and
the APN equaled 195 for the 1950 birth cohort. Accordingly, we expect: 𝑃𝑀,1950 > 𝑃𝐸,1950,
𝑃𝑀,1951 > 𝑃𝐸,1951, 𝑃𝑀,1952 > 𝑃𝐸,1952, 𝑃𝑀,1953 ≅ 𝑃𝐸,1953 , 𝑃𝑀,1954 ≅ 𝑃𝐸,1954, 𝑃𝑀,1955 ≅ 𝑃𝐸,1955,
and 𝑃𝑀,1956 ≅ 𝑃𝐸,1956.

Results
Results dovetail with these expectations (see Table 1). In the 1950-1952 birth cohorts, the
proportion of male birthdates assigned an RSN ≤ APN is markedly higher than the corresponding
proportions for birthdates held by females. Furthermore, in those birth cohorts, the female
proportions more-closely approximate the theoretically expected proportion of birthdates
assigned an RSN ≤ APN than do the corresponding male proportions. In the 1953-1956 birth
cohorts, the proportions of male birthdates assigned an RSN ≤ APN differ less noticeably from
the corresponding proportions for birthdates held by females. Also, the male proportions for the
1953-1956 birth cohorts approximate their corresponding, theoretically expected proportion of
birthdates more closely than do the male proportions for the 1950-1952 cohorts.

Note: Values are rounded.
These findings arise from an analysis that pools monthly-archived sets of the CPDF.
Repeating the analysis on each monthly-archived CPDF does not lead to different conclusions.
Figure 1 presents kernel density plots showing the distribution of 𝐷𝑀𝐸,𝑡 = 𝑃𝑀,𝑡 − 𝑃𝐸,𝑡 (upper
left-hand panel), 𝐷𝐹𝐸,𝑡 = 𝑃𝐹,𝑡 − 𝑃𝐸,𝑡 (upper right-hand panel), and 𝐷𝑀𝐹,𝑡 = 𝑃𝑀,𝑡 − 𝑃𝐹,𝑡 (lower
left-hand panel), by annual birth cohort, when repeating the analysis on each monthly archived
version of the CPDF. Across panels, the distribution of these differences yield substantively
comparable findings to the pooled results: birthdates assigned an RSN≤APN appear with
disproportionately high frequency solely among draft-eligible male employees at risk of
induction.
These results indicate a link between lottery numbers and civilian public employment.
However, they rely heavily on the assumption that the APN cutoff value was administered
7

accurately and uniformly. That said, errors in the administration of the induction call may have
meant that adherence to the APN cutoff was more variable in practice than was stated in policy.
Accordingly, we examined whether the substantive interpretation of the findings—namely, that
the VSSL influenced the ranks of executive-branch employment—remained valid even when the
APN cutoff did not figure prominently in the study design. To do so, we examined the
relationship between the numerical value of RSNs assigned to federal employees and the number
of employees holding the birthdates associated with those RSNs.
[FIGURE 1 HERE]
Given that low RSNs were called for induction first and given that the military’s need for
personnel diminished as the induction call proceeded, one would expect—if the VSSL
influenced rates of federal employment—a decreasing relationship between the value of RSNs
and the number of employees holding birthdates assigned those RSNs solely in data concerning
men born from 1950 to 1952. However, among females as well as males in the placebo cohorts,
one would expect to find a null relationship between the value of employees’ lottery numbers
and the number of employees holding the birthdates to which those RSNs were assigned.
[FIGURE 2 HERE]
As a first step in testing those expectations, Figure 2 shows a plot of the average number
of employees holding a given lottery number and the value of that lottery number. Only among
male employees born from 1950 to 1952 does a negative relationship appear between lottery
numbers and the mean number of employees holding those RSNs. Moreover, among male
employees born from 1950 to 1952, this negative relationship appears strong over the first 200
lottery numbers, then it flattens out thereafter. This trend reflects the fact that the highest APN
8

capped the call for induction at 195: if exposure to military service influences rates of entering
the federal civilian bureaucracy, one would not expect the value of lottery numbers beyond this
highest APN to influence the number of federal employees holding birthdates associated with
those RSNs.
[FIGURE 3 HERE]
Figure 3 shows that a similar trend appears in annual birth cohorts and it displays the
discontinuity that appears at the APN cutoff in each year. That is, in each panel of Figure 3, we
present raw data—from monthly archived versions of the CPDF—concerning federal employees
distinguished by their sex and annual birth cohort; these data are plotted such that the value of
lottery numbers appears on the horizontal axis and the raw number of employees’ holding those
numbers appear on the y-axis. Furthermore, in each panel, we display two smoothers estimated
on, respectively, employees with lottery numbers at or below the APN and employees with
lottery numbers above the APN. The three left-hand panels of Figure 3, appearing on the figure’s
first page, display data for male employees born from 1950 to 1952; in each panel, the number of
male employees declines as the values of their lottery numbers approach the APN. Furthermore,
across each of these birth cohorts, a noticeable discontinuity appears at the APN, thus indicating
a drop in the number of employees holding lottery numbers greater than the APN. No other
panels show this drop at the APN cutoff as vividly. Although male employees born in 1953 (on
the second page of the figure) exhibit a decreasing relationship between lottery numbers and the
number of employees to the left of the APN (n.b. APN=95 in 1953),1 no noteworthy
In both this analysis and in the findings reported earlier in the main text, numbers in the VSSL seem to
have had a slight effect on the executive-branch employment of men from the 1953 birth cohort. Given
that 1953 was the first year in which VSSL numbers were not called for induction, it could be that men
with low numbers volunteered for forms of military service they perceived as less risky in anticipation of
their numbers being called. This phenomenon would have resulted in exposure to military service and the
1

9

discontinuity appears at the APN’s value. On the other hand, data concerning female employees
born in 1951, 1954 and 1955, respectively, exhibit a pronounced discontinuity at the APN, but
the smoother slightly increases as it approaches the APN value from the left, indicating that
higher lottery numbers appeared more frequently in the data. Overall, in these panels concerning
placebo cohorts, the data appear to exhibit a null relationship, suggesting that birthdates
associated with lottery numbers at or below the APN do not appear with disproportionate
frequency in the placebo cohorts. The findings indicate that a study design that puts less
emphasis on the APN cutoff still provides evidence suggesting that the VSSL influenced the
ranks of the civilian executive branch.

Conclusion
Efforts to mobilize martial resources sparked the development of early states (Tilly,
1990), and methods of repaying and inspiring wartime sacrifice resulted in the modern welfare
state (Skocpol, 1992). Although these germinal effects of war on the state have been well
studied, the continual effect of wartime mobilization on who works in the contemporary state has
received less attention, even though long-standing evidence indicates unusually high rates of
public-sector employment among veterans—especially in the U.S. executive branch (Lewis,
2013; Johnson, 2017). This pattern, however, could result from a predisposition that drives
individuals to work for the state in both military and civilian capacities, thus calling into question
the notion that wartime compensation continually affects the state by influencing who works for

acquisition of veteran status, thus remaining consistent with the possibility that personnel policies
incentivizing veterans to join the executive branch are responsible for veterans’ overrepresentation in
public jobs. In any event, the modest effects for that cohort—as compared to the comparable findings for
the 1950-1952 male cohorts—suggest that even if such a phenomenon took place its substantive import is
relatively limited.

10

it. To rule out that possibility, we examined whether birthdates randomly called for induction in
the Vietnam-Era Selective Service Lotteries (VSSL) appeared excessively in the population of
non-sensitive personnel records of the civilian, nondefense and non-postal U.S. executive
branch. We found that draft-eligible birthdates did indeed appear with unusually high frequency
among male employees, but not among female employees. Our findings dovetail with the notion
that exogenously imposed military service increases rates of entering civilian U.S. executive
branch employment, thus supporting the hypothesis that wartime mobilization has influenced the
contemporary administrative state continually. These results, furthermore, suggest that largescale military mustering in times of war or the maintenance of large peacetime armies may have
important long-term consequences on the composition of public and private sector labor markets,
as well as the productivity of workers in those labor markets. Research indicates that veterans’
high level of entering public employment alters the demographic representation of government
workforces (Lewis, 2013); also, empirical studies have debated whether military veterans climb
to higher levels of responsibility or pay—surrogates for productivity—at the same rate as
nonveterans (Johnson, 2015; Johnson and Walker, 2018). Viewed in light of this study’s results,
the present findings provide further reason to believe that mobilization policies affect the makeup and performance of the public sector—thus offering more reason to consider those effects in
the evaluation of policies aimed at wartime mobilization.
With those implications recognized, some limitations of the present study should be
noted. Here we focused on only one slice of the public sector—the U.S. federal, executive
branch. With roughly 2.06 million employees, the non-defense and non-postal executive branch
of the U.S. federal government is the largest single civilian public sector employer in the United
States (U.S. Congressional Research Service, 2019). In comparison, the U.S. federal judicial
11

branch employs only 32,711 employees and the legislative branch employs 30,103 employees
(U.S. Congressional Research Service, 2019). The non-postal and non-defense executive branch
also employs about half of a million more workers than the total number of state and local
employees in California, which ranks as the state with the most such workers, but that portion of
the federal executive branch would still amount to only 14% of the 14,617,399 individuals
working in state and local governments across the U.S. (U.S Census Bureau, 2018). Thus,
readers should recognize that the results reported here, though comprehensive for one segment of
the public sector, do not tell the full story of how the VSSL affected public-sector employment
across the U.S.
In fact, if we assume that the treatment effect of Vietnam-Era military service compelled
veterans to seek other forms of public service (such as at the state or local level), then the overall
impact on labor markets is proportionally greater than what we have shown here. However,
given that the draft lottery induced military service into the U.S. Army and not, say, state
National Guard units, its treatment may have induced veterans to seek federal employment to a
greater extent than local or state-level public sector service. We think future research using the
draft lottery is warranted to investigate the treatment effect of military induction on all levels of
public-sector employment as well as that in the private sector (particular occupations, job
categories, or agencies may disproportionately drive the effects we observe). Likewise, beyond
studies of earnings, the impact of draft status on private sector job type is also worthy of study.
A second limitation of this study is our inability, with the present data, to distinguish the
mechanism for the treatment effect we observe. While our study design effectively rules out
simultaneous selection into the military and civilian public sectors, we cannot discern the nature
of the effect. Such overrepresentation in the public sector after military service may stem from
12

the preferential hiring of veterans, increased feelings of patriotism, a loss of competitiveness in
the private sector due to missing private labor market experience, a sense of entitlement to public
sector “spoils” after serving in the military, socialization to organizational structures common
across the military and civilian public bureaucracies, or any number of other dynamics.
Adjudicating between these mechanisms will further illuminate the findings of the present study,
which show a prominent way in which mobilization for war continues to affect the state.
