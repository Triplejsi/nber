Excessive Entry and Exit in Export Markets
Hiroyuki Kasahara and Heiwai Tang
NBER Working Paper No. 25878
May 2019
JEL No. D8,F1,F2
ABSTRACT
Using transaction-level data for all Chinese firms exporting between 2000 and 2006, we find that
on average 78% of exporters to a country in a given year were new exporters. Among these new
exporters, an average of 60% stopped serving the same country the following year. These rates
are higher if the destination country is a market with which Chinese firms are less familiar. We
build a simple two-period model with imperfect information, in which beliefs about their foreign
demand are determined by learning from neighbors. In the model, a high variance of the prior
distribution of foreign demand induces firms to enter new markets. This is because the profit
function is convex in perceived foreign demand due to the option of exiting, which insures
against the risk of low demand realization. We then use our micro data to empirically examine
several model predictions, and find evidence to support the hypothesis that firms' high entry and
exit rates are outcomes of their rational self-discovery of demand in an unfamiliar market.

Introduction

Research shows that firms’ turnover (entry and exit) rates are much higher in foreign markets than in domestic markets.1 This suggests that firms face considerable uncertainty
in new foreign markets. Existing theoretical studies postulate that firms can learn about
idiosyncratic demand by experimenting with exports to new markets themselves. In practice, however, firms typically attempt to acquire as much information as possible from
other firms before undertaking any risky decisions (Hausmann and Rodrik, 2003), especially when this exploration of foreign markets can entail significant sunk costs.2 While
economists have studied how learning from neighbors determines individuals’ decisions
(e.g., Foster and Rosenzweig, 1995, 2010; Conley and Udry, 2010; Moretti, 2011), it has
not received the same level of attention in the study of export dynamics.
This paper studies the roles of information and learning from others in shaping firms’
export dynamics. We first establish several stylized facts using transaction-level trade data
for the universe of Chinese exporting firms over the period of 2000-2006. We find that
1. The majority of firms exporting to foreign countries are new exporters (78% on
average across 180 countries).
2. Among these new exporters, on average 60% did not continue to serve the same
country the following year.
3. Firms’ exit and entry rates are strongly and positively correlated across destination
countries.
4. These entry and exit rates are particularly high for exports to new markets, especially
to markets with which Chinese exporters are less familiar, like those in Africa (where
83% of exporters on average are new, and among which 68% stopped exporting to
the same country the following year).
5. Both firms’ entry and exit rates are negatively correlated with destination countries’
GDP.
1

According to Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, and Scarpetta (2009), the average turnover (entry + exit) rate
in the domestic market is 5-10%, and is several order of magnitude bigger in foreign markets, as shown by
Eaton et al. (2008), Albornoz et al. (2011), and Blum et al. (2013).
2
Research in international trade has emphasized how high sunk costs of exporting shape export patterns.
Das et al. (2007) and Dickstein and Morales (2018), among others, have provided sizeable estimates of those
costs. Notice that high sunk costs could explain low export entry rate, but not the marjority of small firms
among export starters.

2

6. Both firms’ entry and exit rates are positively correlated with the distance from
destination countries.
These facts are intriguing. One can argue that as fast-growing firms are often seeking
new markets, the high entry rates in many foreign markets among Chinese exporters may
not be surprising given the rapid growth of both the Chinese economy and its firms during
the sample period. That said, it is surprising to see such high firms’ exit rates after their
first year of exporting. If sunk costs are high, as is commonly assumed in heterogeneousfirm models in trade, embedding the standard Melitz-type model in a dynamic setting with
firms’ perfect knowledge about future productivity or demand shocks will not be sufficient
to explain such high exit rates (see, for instance, Ruhl and Willis, 2017). To do so, we will
need a model that features ex-ante uncertainty in firm-specific demand.
One may propose two intuitive reasons to rationalize such high firms’ entry and exit
rates. The first is that new destinations are characterized with high risks but high returns.
A dispersed distribution of firm-specific demand with a thick right tail (e.g., a log-normal
distribution of firm export sales) may induce firms to rationally enter a new market when
the expected sum of profits exceeds the sunk cost of entry. Ex post, however, only a small
fraction of firms survive, with some making large profits. The second potential reason is
simply that firms are irrationally optimistic about the market’s demand, relative to its true
level.
To guide our empirical analysis of the reasons behind firms’ excessive entries and exits
in foreign markets, we develop a simple two-period model of firms’ export decisions when
the true individual demand in foreign markets are unknown to the firms. At the beginning
of the first period, a firm decides whether to export to a foreign market or not, given the
prior distribution of the true demand. If it decides to export, it will learn about the true
demand at the end of the first period. In the second period, it will decide whether to
continue exporting to or exit from the foreign market.
Our model predicts that not only high expected demand but also a large variance of
the prior distribution, can induce firms’ to enter new markets. It is obvious that a higher
expected demand is associated with larger expected profits and therefore more market
entries. The reason why a high variance of perceived market demand will also encourage
firm entry is less clear. In the model, given the option of exiting from the market as a
result of low realized demand, the profit function in the second period is convex in perceived
foreign demand. By Jensen’s inequality, a higher degree of uncertainty in foreign demand
3

translates to a higher expected value of profit in the second period, which encourages more
firms to enter foreign markets in the first period. Thus, our model rationalizes “optimism”
based on a standard rational agent model, without any specific assumptions about the
distribution of demand factors or firms’ irrational behavior.
To sharpen our point that information flows shape firms’ excessive entries and exits, we
also discuss how firms’ observations of neighboring firms’ export performance in a market
change their priors. Based on information inferred from neighbors’ export performance in a
market, a firm updates its prior about the part of the market demand that is common across
firms. However, the signals about foreign market demand are noisy, as observed neighbors’
export performance could be affected by individual firms’ unobserved product appeals,
more so for differentiated products. The model shows that a firm’s export decision and
post-entry performance depend not only on the number of neighboring exporters serving
a particular market, but also the levels and heterogeneity of their export sales, as well as
the firm’s own prior knowledge about the market. While more neighbors may offer a more
precise signal about a foreign market’s demand, the strength of the signal—the average
performance of the neighbors in the market—also matters. A larger number of neighbors
selling in a foreign market will raise the rate of firms’ entry into the same market only if
the signal is positive, whereas it will actually deter entry when the signal is negative. Our
model suggests that to identify potential information spillover in trade, in addition to the
stand-alone measures of the number of neighbors serving a foreign market (defined as a
country-sector pair) and their average performance in the market, an interaction between
the two should be included as a regressor.
Using export transaction-level data for all Chinese exporting firms, we find evidence
supporting the main theoretical predictions. We first show that across countries, firms’
entry and exit rates are both positively correlated with the distance from the countries,
but negatively correlated with their GDP.3 Moreover, the number of exporters in a market,
which presumably provides information about its demand, is negatively correlated with
both the entry and exit rates in the market. This negative correlation is even stronger for
homogeneous goods than differentiated goods. These results are consistent with the model
predictions that exploratory entry and exit are more intense in unfamiliar markets, and
3

The entry rate of a country in year t is defined as the fraction of exporters that did not sell there in
year t − 1, but started selling in the country in year t. The exit rate of a country in year t + 1 is defined as
the ratio of the number of new exporters in a country in year t that ceased exporting to the same country
in year t + 1. These facts are robust to alternative definitions that partially address the phenomenon of
one-off exporting. See Section 3 below.

information from other firms is more useful for predicting post-entry export performance
in homogeneous product markets.
We then show, at the city-sector-country level, that the exit rate is higher on average in
markets that are farther away, even after sector-year and exporting-city-year fixed effects
are controlled for. The exit rates for distant markets are lower for differentiated goods,
consistent with the idea that firms’ decisions are less responsive to new information from
neighbors if market demand is more idiosyncratic.
We then use a restricted sample of all Chinese firms exporting to Sub-Saharan Africa
to test the model predictions about firms’ entries. The choice of this regression sample is
partly due to the computational constraints of using the full sample, and partly due to the
fact that the continent, which has received rapidly growing imports from China, offers an
interesting case for our study. We find that a firm is more likely to enter a new market
(a country-sector pair) in Sub-Saharan Africa if the strength of the signal—measured by
the average demand factor of the market revealed by existing exporters in the same city
exporting to same market—is stronger, more so if the number of such neighbors is higher.
These correlations are found even with the inclusion of firm-year fixed effects to control for
firms’ supply shocks, city-sector-year fixed effects to control for city-level supply shocks,
country-sector-year fixed effects to control for countries’ demand shocks, and city-country
fixed effects to control for historical linkages between a city and a country.4
Finally, we find evidence for the option value of waiting. Specifically, we find that
the number of future entrants (in years t+1 and t+2) in a market—our proxy for firms’
(expected) option value—is negatively correlated with firms’ entry rates in a market after controlling for the contemporaneous number of entrants in the same market and an
exhaustive set of fixed effects.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the literature. Section 3
describes the data. Section 4 establishes some stylized facts. Section 5 introduces a simple
model to guide the empirical analysis. Section 6 presents the results of our empirical
analysis. The final section concludes.
4

In particular, city-country fixed effects capture all path-dependent factors that may simultaneously
determine new exporters’ sales dynamics and neighbors’ export performance, avoiding the common “reflection” problem often encountered in the literature on information or technology spillover.

Related Literature

This paper relates to various strands of literature. First, our paper applies the influential
theoretical work on social learning (e.g., Jovanovic, 1982; Banerjee, 1992; Bikhchandani,
Hirshleifer and Ivo, 1992) to the study of international trade. It also contributes to the
empirical studies that use micro data to test those theories (Foster and Rosenzweig, 1995;
Conley and Udry, 2010; Moretti, 2011).5
Second, it adds to a recent literature on firms’ export dynamics (Eaton, et al., 2008;
Albornoz et al., 2012, among others) by showing the low survival rates of exporters in a
new market.6 The related theoretical literature incorporates self-learning in trade models
to rationalize these findings (Rauch and Watson, 2003; Freund and Pierola, 2010; Iacovone
and Javorcik, 2010; Albornoz et al., 2012; Nguyen, 2012; Eaton et al., 2014; Timoshenko,
2015; Berman, Rebeyrol, and Vicardm, forthcoming, among others),7 whereas we focus on
learning from other firms’ experience, which is a significant departure from existing studies.8
As such, our paper offers a theoretical model as a guide to interpret the findings in the
literature about information spillover in trade (e.g., Chen and Swenson, 2008; Greenaway
and Kneller, 2008; Koenig et al., 2010, Kamal and Sundaram, 2016).
Third, our paper relates to the early empirical studies on the determinants of exporters’
entry and survival (Aitken et al., 1997; Clerides et al., 1998; Bernard and Jensen, 2004).
Our work is different from recent research that also uses transactions-level trade data
(Alvarez et al., 2008; Cadot et al., 2011)9 by focusing on the effects of information flows
5

See Foster and Rosenzweig (2010) for an extensive review of other micro evidence of technology adoption.
6
For instance, Eaton et al. (2008) show that over half of new exporters in Colombia do not survive into
the next year, but survivors account for a significant share of the country’s aggregate exports. Albornoz
et al. (2012) find that in Argentina only about half of new exporters continue into the second year of
exporting. Freund and Pierola (2010) find high entry and exit rates in export markets among Peruvian
agricultural exporters. Blum et al. (2013) find that one-third of Chilean exporters enter into and exit from
exporting multiple times in a 19-year panel.
7
For example, Albornoz et al. (2012) build a model that predicts firms’ “sequential exporting” strategy,
which arises when a firm realizes its export profitability through exporting and then decides whether to serve
other destinations based on its past export performance. Nguyen (2012) develops a model that features
uncertain foreign demands that are correlated across markets.
8
A notable exception is Segura-Cayuela and Vilarrubia (2008), who develop a dynamic general equilibrium model, which features uncertainty and learning about country-specific fixed costs. By observing
existing exporters’ profits in foreign markets, firms update prior beliefs about fixed costs. We focus instdead
on learning about foreign demand.
9
Alvarez et al. (2008) find firm-level evidence from Chile that the probability of exporting in a new
market (product or destination) increases with the prevalence of other exporters in the same market. Cadot
et al. (2011) find evidence for four Sub-Saharan African countries that the probability of export survival

6

firms’ entries and exits in foreign markets. In addition, by exploring information spillover
across destination countries within firms, we can include an exhaustive set of fixed effects
to control for unobserved shocks that drive a firm’s export decisions. It is worth noting
that similar to this paper, Fernandes and Tang (2014) also use the same data set to explore
the presence of information spillovers in firms’ exporting. The main difference between the
two papers is that we take the option value of waiting more seriously in both the theoretical
and empirical analyses, and also highlight firms’ excessive entries and exits in unfamiliar
markets.
Finally, given the reliance on the spatial distribution of existing firms serving different
markets, our paper is naturally related to the new economic geography literature (Krugman, 1991; Krugman and Venables, 1995; and Duranton and Puga, 2004).10

Data

The raw data we use in this paper covers monthly export transactions of the universe
of Chinese firms between 2000 and 2006. For each transaction, the data set reports the
value (in US dollars) and quantity at the product level (over 7000 HS 8-digit categories)
to/from each country (over 200 destination and source countries).11 The data set also
offers information on a firm’s ownership type (domestic private, foreign, and state-owned)
and trade regime (processing versus non-processing) in which it registered, as well as the
prefecture city it is located. We study learning from neighboring exporters in the same
city. There are on average 425 cities plus municipalities, according to China’s Customs’
definition.12
We aggregate all observations to the annual frequency to alleviate measurement issues
related to infrequent trade that varies across products or countries. In the empirical analysis, we will focus on learning about demand in a market, which is defined as a country-HS2
pair.
All firms in China engaged in international trade are required by Chinese law to register
as either processing exporters or non-processing (ordinary) exporters.13 The majority of
increases with the presence of other firms’ exporting the same product to the same country. Our model,
together with that of Fernandes and Tang (2014), offer theoretical insights to rationalize their findings.

The number of cities in our sample increses from 408 in 2000 to 425 in 2006.
13
Since the beginning of economic reforms in the early 1980s, the Chinese government has implemented

7

processing exporters have long-time committed foreign buyers (e.g. Foxconn has Apple as
the single most important long-time customer). One would be concerned that for processing
exporters, the room for learning about foreign demand is limited, as the related information
is often provided directly by the foreign partner. Without a convincing way to separate out
information provided by foreign buyers, we will exclude all processing firms and trading
companies (e.g., wholesale-retail firms) from the sample used in the empirical analysis
below.

Stylized Facts

Our empirical analysis relies on the fact that firms enter and exit foreign markets actively. Table 1 presents summary statistics about the number of countries served by (nonprocessing) exporters. The average number of countries served by an exporter ranges
between 5 and 6, with the median fluctuating between 2 and 3. The large number of multicountry exporters permits us to examine the within-firm variation in export performance
across countries, even after we control for firm-year fixed effects in the regressions.
We first document several stylized facts about Chinese firms’ exporting dynamics. The
first set of facts are about the very high entry and exit rates into different foreign markets
among Chinese exporters. As reported in the first row of Table 2, we find that across
the 180+ countries in our sample over 6 years (2001-2006), the entry rates, defined as the
fraction of exporters selling in a country in year t that did not sell there in year t − 1,
average around 78%.14 Among these new exporters, a majority of them stopped exporting
to the same market the following year. Specifically, the second row shows that the exit
rates, defined as the fraction of new exporters that ceased exporting to the same country in
the year right after the year of entry, average around 60% across all countries and years.15
various policies to promote exports and foreign direct investment. Most notable of all is the exemption of
tariffs on imported materials and value-added tax for processing plants, which assemble inputs into final
products for foreign buyers. Readers are referred to Naughton (1996), Feenstra and Hanson (2005) and
Fernandes and Tang (2012) for more details about the regulatory regimes governing processing firms in
China.
14
The average entry rate is computed as the mean of the average entry rates cross years, with the average
entry rate per year computed first as a mean entry rate across destination countries in that year. The
entry rate for 2000, the first year in our sample, is excluded in the calculation as it is always equal to 1 by
definition.
15
Using Danish firm-level monthly data, Geishecker et al. (2019) find that 33 percent of firm-productdestination export spells last less than one month. They argue that such “one-off exporting” events are
due to unsolicited buyer-side driven exporting.

8

One may be worried that the high rates are driven by a few outlying markets that are
recently served only by a few firms, which might enter and drop out immediately after
some experimentation. In the third and fourth rows, we show comparably high entry and
exit rates even for the median country in each sample to invalidate this concern.
We report in Panel B the same set of statistics by focusing on the sample of firms that
export to Sub-Sahara Africa, in which Chinese firms’ economic engagement has increased
substantially. The entry and exit rates are even higher for this restricted sample of firms.
In particular, the entry rates and exit rates of a Sub-Sahara Africa country average around
83% and 68% across years, respectively. These findings are consistent with the prior that
many Chinese firms are less familiar with the African markets than other markets.
One may also be concerned that our results simply reflect the phenomenon of occasional
exporting (e.g., Blum, Claro and Horstmann, 2013 and Geishecker et al., 2019). It is
possible that our identified new exporters might have already sold in a market in year
t − 2 or even before, but somehow stopped exporting to the market for one year in t − 1.
Similarly, our identified exiters might somehow stop exporting to a market for one year in
t + 1, but then came back in year t + 2 or any future years. To examine the potential issues
related to this occasional exporting, we report in Table 3 the entrants in a market in 2001,
that exited in 2002, and re-entered in subsequent years. Across all country-HS2 markets,
there were 133,972 new export transactions by firms that did not serve those markets in
2000. Of those 133,972 transactions, 64% exited from the markets in 2002, but 5%, 2.4%,
1.3%, and 0.9% re-entered the same markets in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively.
While the percentage of exits that lasted for only one year were not trivial, the cumulative
rate of re-entry between 2003 and 2006, among those that exited for one year in 2002 is
only 15%. It is unlikely that the patterns shown in Table 2 and in the rest of the paper
are largely driven by occasional export entries and exits.
To alleviate the concerns for occasional exporting, in all empirical analyses in the rest
of the paper, we use a more restrictive way than the standard approach to define entries
and exits. In particular, an entry is defined as a firm’s export transaction in a market (a
country or a country-sector) in year t but not in years t − 1 and t − 2. Symmetrically, an
exit is defined as a firm’s export transaction in a market that is observed in year t but
not in years t + 1 and t + 2. Because of the data requirement to observe a firm’s export
status 2 years before an entry, the sample we use to analyze entries is a reduced panel with
2002 as the first sample year. Likewise, since we need two years of observations after an
entry to define exits, the sample we use to analyze exits is an even a shorter panel that
9

covers only three years from 2002 to 2004. It is worth noting that all our empirical results
below remain robust to using a longer panel of firms with firms’ entries and exits defined
in the standard way, which only require information on a firm’s export status either the
year before or after the year of the firm’s first year of exporting to a market.
Using the cohort of entrants in 2003 with the restrictive definitions of entries and exits,
we show in Figure 1 a tightly positive relationship between firms’ entry and exit rates
across countries (for 2003). Figure 2 shows the same positive relationship across countries
for differentiated and homogeneous products, using the classifications proposed by Rauch
(1999).16 The positive correlation appears to be higher for differentiated products, suggesting that for the same entry rate per market, a larger fraction of firms exit. To the
extent that differentiated goods are intuitively associated with more firm-specific idiosyncratic demand factors, the degree of ex ante uncertainty should be higher, which will be
associated with higher ex-post exit rates.
These facts are, to the best of our knowledge, novel relative to those documented in the
literature. High entry rates may not be surprising as the Chinese economy and its firms are
growing during the sample period. However, it is surprising to see such high exit rates in
those markets. If sunk costs are high, the standard dynamic heterogeneous-firm model in
trade, say the dynamic extension of Melitz (2003) that features stochastically growing firm
productivity and perfect information, cannot rationalize such high exit rates. To guide our
empirical exploration of the reasons behind these intriguing stylized facts, we introduce a
simple two-period model with imperfect information next.

5

A Simple Model

The facts documented above motivate us to develop a model in which firms face ex-ante
uncertainty in demand, and form expectations about market-specific demand when making
export decisions. We develop a two-period model in which firms do not know the exact
level but only the distribution of a foreign country’s market demand. At the beginning
of the first period, a firm decides whether it exports to a foreign market or not given the
prior distribution over the true demand; if it decides to export, then it will learn about
the true demand at the end of the first period. It can always wait for a period and decides
16

Specifically, the product differentiation indicator is set to 1 for a sector (HS2) if at least half of the HS
4-digit products within that HS2 are classified by Rauch (1999) as differentiated goods. A concordance is
used to map each SITC 4-digit (Rev 2) to multiple HS 4-digit categories.

10

to export in the second period when the signal about the foreign market’s demand may
become more precise. In the second period, for those that decided to export in the first
period, a firm will decide if it will continue to export or exit from the foreign market.

5.1

Setup and notations

To focus on the main mechanisms at work, we make a number of simplifying assumptions.
Consider a set of firms with heterogenous productivity. Each firm is endowed with firmspecific productivity ϕ, which is known to the firm and remains constant over time. The
density function of ϕ for the firms that are not exporting at the beginning of first period
is given by g(ϕ).
The true demand in a foreign market, denoted by x∗ , is fixed and non-stochastic. A
firm does not know the value of x∗ at the beginning of the first period, and holds a prior
belief that x is distributed normally with mean µ and variance σ 2 :
x ∼ N (µ, σ 2 ).
Given the productivity ϕ and the demand level x, the per-period profit of exporting to
foreign market is given by
π(x, ϕ) = x + ϕ − f
where x + ϕ is interpreted as the gross profit while f is interpreted as the per-period fixed
cost of exporting.17
Denote the firm’s export decision in the period t by dt ∈ {0, 1} for t = 1, 2., where
dt = 1 indicates that a firm exports in period t.

5.2

The second period after exporting in the first period

At the end of the first period, the true value of foreign demand x∗ is revealed to the firms
who exported in the foreign market. A firm will export in the second period if π(x∗ , ϕ) ≥ 0,
i.e.,
d2 = 1

if x∗ + ϕ ≥ f.

17
Unlike in Fernandes and Tang (2014), we specify the per-period profit function, π(x, ϕ), to be linear
in the demand level x so that the per-period profit function is not strictly convex in x. In our model, an
option to exit is the reason why the profit function in the second period is convex.

11

In this case, a firm with ϕ < ϕ∗2 := f − x∗ will exit from the foreign market in the second
period. Note that the value of ϕ∗2 does not depend on the prior belief.

5.3

The first period

In the first period, given the prior belief x ∼ N (µ, σ 2 ), a firm’s subjective expected profit
from the second period is given by
Z
V (ϕ) := Ex [max{π(x, ϕ), 0}] =

max{x + ϕ − f, 0}(1/σ)φ((x − µ)/σ)dx,

√
where φ(t) = (1/ 2π) exp(−t2 /2).
A firm will receive zero profit in both periods if it decides not to export. On the other
hand, the discounted sum of subjective expected profits from the two periods when a firm
decides to export is Ex [π(x, ϕ)] + βV (ϕ), where β ∈ (0, 1) is a discount factor. Therefore,
a firm will export in the first period if Ex [π(x, ϕ)] + βV (ϕ) ≥ 0, i.e.,
Z
d1 = 1

if µ + ϕ − f + β

max{x + ϕ − f, 0}(1/σ)φ((x − µ)/σ)dx ≥ 0.

In this case, a firm with ϕ ≥ ϕ∗1 will export in the first period, where ϕ∗1 is uniquely defined
R
by µ + ϕ∗1 − f + β max{x + ϕ∗1 − f, 0}(1/σ)φ((x − µ)/σ)dx = 0.
The following proposition states that, as the value of µ or σ increases, a firm with lower
productivity will be induced to export in the first period and that some firms decide to
export in the first period even when the expected per-period profit in the first period is
negative.
Proposition 1. (a) ϕ∗1 is strictly decreasing in µ and σ 2 and is independent of x∗ . (b)
µ + ϕ∗1 − f < 0.
Part (a) of Proposition 1 implies that when a firm is more optimistic (higher value
of µ) or is more uncertain about foreign demand (higher value of σ 2 ), it has a stronger
incentive to export. The fact that a firm is more likely to export when it is more optimistic
about foreign demand is intuitive. The effect of σ 2 on an incentive to export is related
to the option of exiting from the foreign market in the second period when demand turns
out to be low. Because a firm has an option to exit, the profit function in the second
period, max{x + ϕ − f, 0}, is a convex function of x. As illustrated in Figure 9, by Jensen’s

12

inequality, a higher degree of uncertainty in x translates into the higher expected value of
max{x + ϕ − f, 0}, leading to a stronger incentive to export in the first period.
Part (b) of Proposition 1 implies that firms with ϕ ∈ (ϕ∗1 , ϕ̄) decide to start exporting
in the first period although their expected first-period profit is negative, where ϕ̄ is defined
by the zero-profit condition µ + ϕ̄ − f .
In sum, our model shows that the high exit rates in the second period arise when the
mean and the variance of the prior distribution over the true demand in the initial period
are high. In the model, the high mean value of the prior distribution induces entries due
to “optimism” and will lead to exits after learning the true demand. A high variance of
x also results in more entries in the first period because a firm has an incentive to learn
about the true demand in a foreign market by hoping that the true demand is really high
while insuring against the risk of low true demand by keeping the option to exit from the
foreign market.

5.4

Exit rates in the second period

Consider a set of firms who have different productivity ϕ ∼iid g(ϕ) but share a common
prior belief over the true demand. We now analyze how the average exit rates in the second
period among firms who start exporting in the first period depends on their prior belief
characterized by the value of µ and σ 2 .
We impose the following assumption to exclude a trivial case that all firms continue to
export in the second period.
Assumption 1. ϕ∗2 > ϕ∗1 .
Figure 10 illustrates a firm’s entry and exit decision as well as the determination of
exit rate. The density function of ϕ among firms who decided to export in the first period
is given by g(ϕ)/(1 − G(ϕ∗1 )) if ϕ ≥ ϕ∗1 and 0 if ϕ < ϕ∗1 , where G(ϕ) is the cumulative
distribution function of ϕ. Because any firm whose productivity is below ϕ∗2 will exit in
the second period, the fraction of firms exiting in the second period (the exit rate) among
the firms that start exporting in the first period is given by
exit rate =

G(ϕ∗2 ) − G(ϕ∗1 )
.
1 − G(ϕ∗1 )

(1)

Because ϕ∗2 is independent of µ and σ 2 , together with G(ϕ∗2 ) < 1, the following is a
direct consequence of Proposition 1 and (1).
13

Proposition 2. Suppose that Assumption 1 holds and x∗ is finite. Then, the exit rate in
the second period among the firms that start exporting in the first period, as defined in (1),
is increasing in the value of µ and σ 2 .
In an extreme case, as x∗ → −∞ so that exporting becomes not profitable to any firms,
the exit rate in the second period approaches 1 while some firms will choose to export in
the first period as long as their prior mean µ is finite.

5.5

Learning from neighbors

Let us now extend the model to incorporate learning from neighboring firms, in an attempt
to show how firms respond to available information. Realistic learning implies that firms
will never be able to learn the true demand within finite time. As such, we need to introduce
some frictions in learning in the form of firm-specific demand factor. Specifically, let us
suppose that the per-period profit of exporting to foreign market is now given by
π(x, ϕ) = x + ϕ + z − f
where z ∼ N (0, σz2 ) is a firm-specific demand attribute, which is unknown to the firm when
it makes an export decision.
Different from most existing papers on learning to export that focuses on learning
from one’s own experience, we focus on learning from neighboring firms instead (see also
Fernandes and Tang, 2014). A firm updates its subjective distribution of x by observing
neighboring firms’ (indexed by j) export sales in the same market. Suppose that the firm
knows each neighbor’s productivity. It can then extract a signal for x from its revenue
from selling in the same market as
ζj := x + zj = ln Rj − ϕj .
In Section 6 below, we will discuss how to compute ϕj and thus ζj based on this formula,
using only trade data.
Given the subjective mean and variance (µ0 , σ02 ) in the initial period, the updated subjective mean and variance (µ, σ 2 ) at the beginning of next period, after observing neighboring firms’ exports, are determined by the number of new exporters n in neighborhood
P
in the current period and the signal ζ̄ := n1 nj=1 ζj . Specifically, in the way proposed by

14

Because a higher µ will induce a firm to start exporting, the comparative static result
in (3) implies the following proposition.
Proposition 3. The likelihood of a firm’s starting to export to a foreign market is increasing in the strength of the signal about the market’s demand (high ζ̄) inferred from
neighbors’ exports, and more so if the signal is revealed by more exporting neighbors (high
n) and less so if the product is differentiated (high σz2 ).
In view of Proposition 1, equation (4) implies that, conditioning on the strength of the
signal, an incentive to export is smaller when the number of exporting neighbors (n) is
larger or when the initial uncertainty (σ02 ) is smaller. Furthermore, equation (5) implies
that the effect of the number of exporting neighbors or the initial uncertainty on export
decision approaches zero as the value of σz2 increases.
Proposition 4. Conditional on the strength of the signal, the likelihood of a firm’s starting
to export to a foreign market is decreasing in the number of exporting neighbors and increasing in the initial uncertainty, but these effects can be arbitrarily small for sufficiently
differentiated products.
In view of Proposition 2, the exit rate among new exporters is related to µ and σ 2 at
the time of entry as implied by Propositions 3-4. Therefore, Propositions 2-4 lead to the
following predictions.
15

Prediction 1 (Exit Rates)

The exit rate among firms that start exporting to a for-

eign market is increasing in the expected level (µ) and uncertainty (σ 2 ) about the market’s
demand. The relationship between the exit/entry rate and uncertainty is stronger for homogeneous goods than for differentiated goods, as learning is less effective for the latter.
Prediction 2 (Strength of Signals and Entry Decisions)

The entry rate among

the firms that have not exported before increases with the strength of the signal (high ζ̄),
especially so when the number of exporting neighbors is large and when the product is
homogeneous.

5.6

The model with one-time sunk cost and the option value of waiting

Now suppose that, in addition to the per-period fixed cost f , a firm has to pay one-time sunk
cost K to start exporting. In such a case, a firm has an incentive to wait for exporting if it
anticipates that the value of x will be revealed through learning from exporting neighbors.
Consider two extreme cases. In the first case, a firm anticipates that no neighbors start
exporting (n = 0) so that no additional learning happens in the second period. Then, a
firm will export in the first period if the expected sum of profits over two periods is greater
than 0, i.e.,
µ + ϕ − f − K + βEx [max{x + ϕ − f, 0}] ≥ 0.

(6)

Let ϕ̄0 be the value of ϕ such that (6) holds with equality so that a firm will export in the
first period iff ϕ ≥ ϕ̄0 .
In the second case, a firm anticipates that it will perfectly learn the value of x with
n → ∞. Then, a firm will export in the first period if the expected sum of profits over
two periods when it starts exporting in the first period is greater than the expected sum
of profits if a firm does not export in the first period and it decides to export or not in the
second period after learning the value of x, i.e.,
µ + ϕ − f − K + βEx [max{x + ϕ − f, 0}] ≥ βEx [max{x + ϕ − f − K, 0}].

(7)

Let ϕ̄∞ be the value of ϕ such that (7) holds with equality so that a firm will export in
the first period iff ϕ ≥ ϕ̄∞ .
Proposition 5. ϕ̄∞ > ϕ̄0

16

Therefore, due to the option value of waiting, a firm with ϕ ∈ (ϕ̄0 , ϕ̄∞ ) will not export
in the first period when it anticipates perfect learning while it will do so when no learning
on the value of x is anticipated.
We examine the following prediction empirically.
Prediction 3 (Option Value of Waiting) (a) The option value of waiting (i.e., postponed entry) is higher when a firm anticipates that more neighbors start exporting next
period. (b) The option value of waiting is lower for differentiated products.
Part (a) of Prediction 3 is an implication of Proposition 5. While we do not offer an
explicit theoretical analysis on part (b), the logic behind this prediction is in line with
the result of Proposition 5: The incentive to enter a new market is higher for differentiated goods than for homogeneous goods because the option value of waiting is higher
for homogeneous goods than for differentiated goods. In an extreme case of no learning
from neighbors in differentiated goods, a firm producing differentiated goods can only learn
about market demand by entering into a new market, leading to higher entry rates. This
implies that, other things equal, entry rates are higher for differentiated goods than for
homogeneous goods because firms producing differentiated goods have less incentive to
wait for entry.

Empirical Evidence

6.1

Suggestive Evidence

Guided by the model predictions, we first establish a few more facts before presenting our
regression results. Given that σ 2 is not directly observed in the data, we use three proxies
for uncertainty about a market’s demand. The first proxy is the (log) distance between
the destination country and China, based on the idea that distance impedes information
flows and communication. The second proxy is the (log) number of Chinese entrants to
a market. If other firms offer information about a market, the measure of uncertainty
about the market should be a decreasing function of the total number of entrants into a
market. The third proxy is the (log) GDP of a destination country. The basic idea is that
information about larger economies should be more abundant.
Figure 3 shows a positive and significant (with a t-stat of 2.16) cross-country correlation
between the entry rate and the destination country’s distance from China for the year
17

2003. Figure 4 shows instead a positive and significant (with a t-stat of 2.73) cross-country
correlation between the exit rate and a destination country’s distance from China. The
results in both figures are consistent with our model prediction that uncertainty about a
country’s demand will encourage seemingly excessive firms’ entries and thus exits.
Next we explore the relationship between firms’ rates of entry into a country and
the number of existing Chinese exporters selling there the year before. To address the
concern that the relationship is simply capturing the market size effect, we partial out (log)
GDP of the destination country by first regressing the (log) number of Chinese exporters
in a country on (log) GDP of the same country, and then taking the residuals as our
dependent variable of interest.18 Our model predicts that both the entry and exit rates
will be negatively correlated with the (log) number of existing exporters, and the slope is
expected to be steeper for homogeneous than differentiated goods. Indeed, Figure 5 shows
a statistically significant and negative relationship between the country-specific entry rate
and the number of existing exporters in a market (after partialling out the correlation with
destination countries’ GDP). The relationship is stronger for homogeneous goods than
differentiated goods. Through the lens of our model, the idea is that if demand for firms
producing differentiated products is more idiosyncratic, information about a market from
other firms is less useful.
Figure 6 shows that the rate of firms’ exit from a country is negatively correlated with
the (log) number of existing exporters (after partialling out the correlation with destination
countries’ GDP) to the country. Since entry and exit rate are highly correlated and are
essentially affected by information asymmetry in the same way, it is not surprising to see
such negative correlation, based on the reasons we used to explain the patterns in Figure
5.
Figures 7 and 8 plot the entry and exit rates on the (log) GDP across countries for
the year 2003. Both rates are strongly and negatively correlated with the market size of
countries. While GDP can be correlated with many other economic fundamentals, the
usual conjecture that firms are less likely to enter smaller markets contrasts sharply with
the negative correlation we find here. The idea that firms know more about large markets,
either because they are more visible or there have been many existing exporters offering
information about the market, is consistent with the negative correlation between entry
(exit) rates and market size across countries.
18
The pattern is robust to simply using the (log) number of Chinese firms without partialling out the
correlation with countries’ GDP.

18

To sum up, we find that the majority of exporters are new exporters in many countries
(78% on average across 180 countries). Among these new exporters, a majority of them
(60% on average) did not continue to serve the same country the following year. The entry
and exit rates are positively and significantly correlated across destination countries. They
are particularly high for exports to small and developing countries, especially those in Africa
(83% of exporters on average are new; with 68% of the entrants stopped exporting to the
same country the following year). Both firms’ entry and exit rates are negatively correlated
with the GDP of destination countries, but positively correlated with the distance from
them. These are suggestive evidence so far, and we now come to the firm-level regression
analysis, which can tackle various usual suspects behind the suggestive evidence.

6.2

Empirical Analysis

This section aims to empirically verify Predictions 1 to 3.
6.2.1

Exiting decisions in the first year of exporting

Prediction 1 states that the exit rate, defined as the fraction of new exporters that exit
from a market, should be increasing in the expected level and uncertainty of the market’s
demand, but less so for differentiated goods than homogeneous goods, as learning from
others is more effective for the latter.
To empirically verify Prediction 1 and to confirm more systematically the patterns
documented in Figures 4 and 6 about the average exit rate for each market, we estimate
the following regression specification:


2
2
Exitc,m,s,t = α + βp σm,s
+ δDif fs × p σm,s
+ {F E} + c,m,s,t ,

(8)

where the dependent variable, Exitc,m,s,t , stands for the fraction of firms that enter country
m and sector s (a HS 2-digit category) from Chinese city c in year t, but stop exporting in
the same country-sector market in years t + 1 and t + 2.

2
The regressor of interest, p σm,s
, is a proxy for uncertainty about market m, s. It is
equal to either the (log) distance between China and country m (in that case, the sector
subscript s is redundant) or the (log) number of Chinese existing exporters in market
m, s in year t. {F E} includes sector-year fixed effects to control for all global supply and
demand shocks in a sector; and city-year fixed effects to control for any supply shocks

19

coming from the region where the firm is located. c,m,s,t is the residual.
The variable Dif fs represents product differentiation of sector s. As a proxy, we use
the indicator for product differentiation, constructed based on the classification by Rauch
(1999), as discussed in Section 4.
A drawback of using Rauch’s product differentiation indicators is that it captures not
only the importance of firm-specific product appeals that affect demand, but possibly also
the inverse of market competition. To the extent that competition can be less intense in differentiated product markets, any positive correlation we find between firms’ entries or exits
and Rauch’s production differentiation indicators may be independent of the information
story. To this end, we propose a second measure of Dif fs , based on our model. According
to our model, we can use estimated σz2 , the standard error of firm-specific product appeals
(z) in each market (country-sector) and year, as a direct measure of Dif fs . To estimate
σz2 , we need to first discuss how to use customs transaction-level data to construct the
measure of firms’ productivity in each sector.
Estimating firm productivity in each sector and product appeal in each market
We can estimate firm i’s productivity in sector s and year t (φi,s,t ) by estimating the
following specification:
ln Ri,m,s,t = φm,s,t + φi,s,t + i,m,s,t ,

(9)

where ln Ri,m,s,t is the log of firm i’s export sales to country m in sector s in year t,
while φm,s,t is a dummy to absorb the demand factor of the same market in year t, which is
common to all firms. We estimate this equation using the sample of export sales to countries
outside of Africa, and take the estimated φi,s,t , φbi,s,t , as the estimated productivity of firm
i in sector s. The residual from the estimation i,m,s,t will be the empirical counterpart to
the firm’s product appeal in the market in year t.
Using a firm’s sector-specific productivity estimate and its market-specific sales, we can
then construct a measure of the signal for sector s in country m from every neighboring
firm that exports to the same market. The idea is to partial out a firm’s (j) sector-specific
productivity from its sales in market m and year t, as ζj,m,s,t = ln Rj,m,s,t − φ̂j,s,t . The
average value of the signals among the set of neighboring exporters can be computed as
ζ̄c,m,s,t =

1

X

|Nc,m,s,t |

20

j∈Nc,m,s,t

ζj,m,s,t ,

(10)

where Nc,m,s,t is a set of existing firms that export from city c to market m, s in year
t. Firms’ individual product appeals i,m,s,t will be averaged out to 0 empirically, as the
underlying distribution is assumed to have mean 0.
Finally, for each market-year (m, s, t), we can construct a measure of model-based
2
idiosyncrasy of firms’ demand (σz(m,s,t)
) by computing the standard error of the estimated

signal ζj,m,s,t ’s from the set of exporters selling in the same market as:

where Nm,s,t is the set of exporters to market m, s in year t.
Regression Results

As described in Section 6.1, we use the restrictive panel that in-

cludes all country-sector pairs in which Chinese firms ever started exporting in a new
market since 2002, but did not export in the previous two years. Since we need two years
after a firm’s initial exporting to define exits in a restrictive way, our panel is further
reduced to the period between 2002 and 2004.
The results of estimating equation (8) using the restrictive sample are reported in
Table 4. Standard errors are clustered by city. In column (1) when we use (log) distance
2 ), we find that after controlling for sector-year
as the proxy for demand uncertainty (σm,s

and city-year fixed effects, there is a statistically significant positive correlation between
the (log) distance and the rate of firms’ exits from the market. In column (2), when
we use the (log) number of firms in the same city (neighbors) that export to market
(m, s) to proxy for market uncertainty, we find results that are consistent with those in
column (1). Specifically, we find a statistically significant and negative coefficient on (log)
number of neighboring firms, suggesting that more neighbors, presumably by providing
more information about market m, s to potential entrants, may lower the post-entry exit
rates.
We also find that the correlations between the two proxies for market uncertainty and
the city-market specific exit rates are weaker for differentiated product markets. Specifically, when we use Rauch’s differentiation indicators as proxies for product differentiation
in columns (3) and (4), we find a negative and significant coefficient on the interaction term


Dif fs × p σm,s
if p σm,s
is proxied by (log) distance; and a positive though insignificant


coefficient on the interaction term if p σm,s

exporting to the market m, s in the same year.
In columns (5) and (6), when Dif fs is measured by our constructed σ̂z(m,s,t) , the

2
coefficients on the interaction terms Dif fs × p σm,s
take the same signs (positive when

2
p σm,s is log distance and negative when it is (log) number of neighbors) and become
statistically more significant. Table A1 in the appendix shows entirely consistent results
when we repeat all exercises reported in Table 4 by using provinces, rather than cities, to
define neighborhoods. In sum, the results in Table 4 support Prediction 1.
6.2.2

Learning from neighbors

Our next exercise is to empirically verify Prediction 2, which is about how learning from
neighbors affects firms’ entry decisions.
Entryi,c,m,s,t = α+β ζ̄c,m,s,t +θζ̄c,m,s,t ×nc,m,s,t +δnc,m,s,t +γ ln(T F Pi,c,s,t )+{F E}+i,c,m,s,t .
(12)
The dependent variable, Entryi,c,m,s,t , is an indicator for the entry of firm i from city
c in market m, sector s in year t. It is equal to 1 if the firm reports exports to country m
in sector s and year t, 0 otherwise. Since we are gauging the effects on firms’ propensity
to enter a market, we drop all existing exporters in a market (i.e., all firms that already
exported to market m, s in year t−1). As explained in the introduction, we use a regression
sample that includes all potential markets only in the 46 Sub-Sahara African countries to
avoid the computational constraints.
The regressors of interest are the number of neighbors exporting to country m, sector
s in year t (nc,m,s,t ) and its interaction term with the signal from the neighbors ζ̄c,m,s,t ,
computed based on (10). Following our comparative statics (3)-(5), we use nc,m,s,t instead
of its log version although the results remain qualitatively identical when we use the log
of nc,m,s,t . Proposition 2 predicts that the propensity to enter a new market, among the
firms that have not been exporting in the same market before, increases with the strength
of the signal, especially when there are more existing neighboring firms exporting to the
same market. Thus, β > 0, θ > 0, γ > 0, while the sign of δ is ambiguous.
By exploiting variation in export performance across countries and years within firms,
we can include an exhaustive set of fixed effects ({F E}) to control for many unobserved
determinants of new exporters’ export dynamics. In particular, in all the regression specifications, we always include city-country fixed effects, which control for the bilateral distance

22

between a city and a country, as well as physical distance and any unobserved city-marketspecific determinants of export performance and dynamics, such as historical linkages that
may affect the available information and infrastructure for exports from a city to a country.
In addition, we control for city-sector-year, country-sector-year, and firm-year fixed effects,
respectively. Country-sector-year fixed effects control for any aggregate shocks that may
affect the general attractiveness of a market, such as time-varying demand, exchange rates,
and economic policies in the importing countries. City-sector-year fixed effects control for
any supply shocks, such as government policies, which affect all exporters in a city. Firmyear fixed effects further control for firm productivity shocks. Importantly, by focusing
on the within-firm cross-country correlation between new exporters’ performance and the
prevalence of neighbors’ export activities, we address the potential sample selection bias
that arises from the endogenous entry decisions that vary across heterogeneous firms.
In addition to the firm-year fixed effects which already capture any firm-specific productivity shocks, we can also control for a firm’s sector-specific total factor productivity
(TFP), which is estimated based on (9). Including ln(T F Pi,c,s,t ) as a control comes with
considerable cost in terms of a significant reduction in sample size, as we can only estimate
TFP for firms that export to both Africa and non-African nations within a sector.
Table 5 reports the results of estimating equation (12). Standard errors are clustered
at the city-destination level. The results remain robust to clustering by other groups.
As shown in column (1), after controlling for country-sector-year fixed effects, city-sectoryear fixed effects, and city-sector-country fixed effects, we find that a firm’s probability of
entering a market is positively correlated with the strength of the signal, ζ̄c,m,s,t , inferred
from the same-market export performance of neighbors in the same city. The learning
effect is stronger if there are more neighboring exporters revealing the signal, as suggested
by a positive coefficient (θ) on ζ̄c,m,s,t × nc,m,s,t . The coefficient (δ) on the number of
neighbors serving the same market (nc,m,s,t ) is actually negative, but our model has no
specific prediction about its sign. This set of results remains robust to the inclusion of
firm-year fixed effects (column (2)) and firms’ sector-level TFP (column (3)).19
Next we empirically verify the last part of Prediction 2 about the smaller learning
potential for differentiated products. To this end, we include in addition to the baseline
regressors, the corresponding interaction terms between the estimated σ̂z(m,s,t) and each
of the following regressors: ζ̄c,m,s,t , ζ̄c,m,s,t × nc,m,s,t , and nc,m,s,t . Column (4) shows that
19
When we repeat the same set of regressions but with a neighborhood defined as a province rather than
a city, we find consistent and significant results.

23

while the interaction term σ̂z(m,s,t) × ζ̄c,m,s,t is insignificant, the coefficient on the triple
interaction σ̂z(m,s,t) × ζ̄c,m,s,t ×nc,m,s,t is negative and significant, suggesting that conditional
on a positive signal inferred from a fixed number of neighbors, the learning effect is weaker
for the more differentiated products (high σ̂z(m,s,t) ).20 The last two columns confirm the
robustness of these results by including firm-year fixed effects and firms’ sector-level TFP
sequentially.
6.2.3

Option value of waiting

Our final exercise is to examine Prediction 3, which is about the option value of waiting
(i.e., postponed entry). To this end, we estimate the following specification
Entryi,c,m,s,t = α + βnec,m,s,t+n + δnec,m,s,t + {F E} + i,c,m,s,t ,

(13)

where Entryi,c,m,s,t is the same dependent variable as in equation (12). For the same
computational constraints about the feasible size of the regression sample discussed in
the previous section, the regression sample includes only potential markets in Sub-Sahara
African countries. As in the previous analysis on firm entry, we drop firms that have
already exported to market m, s in year t − 1.
The first task is to find a way to construct a proxy for the option value. In our model
with perfect foresights, we can approximate the option value by the realized number of
entrants (not logged) in the future. We therefore use the number of entrants, nec,m,s,t+n , in
the following two years as a proxy for the option value of waiting.21
As reported in Table 6, we find in column (1) a negative and significant coefficient on
the number of future entrants (the total number of entrants in year t + 1 and t + 2) in a
market, after controlling for the number of contemporaneous entrants in the same market
(nec,m,s,t ) and the identical set of fixed effects reported in Table 5. There results are robust
to the control of the firm’s sector-specific TFP (column (2)).
In columns (3) and (4), we add in addition to the regressors described in (13) the
interaction terms between each of the regressors and our estimate of product differentiation,
σ̂z(m,s,t) . We find no significant coefficient on the interaction term between the number of
20
Notice that the stand-alone σ̂z(m,s,t) is absorbed by the country-sector-year fixed effects. The number
of observations drops when σ̂z(m,s,t) is used in interaction terms as there are city-market-years in which
there’s only one existing exporter (i.e., σ̂z(m,s,t) = 0).
21
The regression results remain robust to using the number of entrants in the following one year to proxy
for the option value of waiting.

24

future entrants in the same market and σ̂z(m,s,t) . In sum, even we find significant evidence
about the option value of waiting on average, which supports Prediction 3, there is no
systematic difference in the option value between homogeneous and differentiated product
markets.

Conclusion

This paper studies the surprisingly high entry and exit rates among Chinese firms selling
in foreign markets. We first use a data set that covers all export transactions from Chinese
firms to all countries over the 2000-2006 period to document several stylized facts that
are new to the trade literature. We find that a majority of exporters to a country are
new exporters. More surprisingly, over half of the new exporters in a market stop serving
the same market the following year. We also find that a destination country’s entry rate,
defined as the fraction of exporters that are new, is positively correlated with its exit rate,
defined as the fraction of new exporters that stopped exporting in the following years. Both
entry and exit rates are negatively correlated with destination countries’ market size, but
positively correlated with their distance from China.
We build a simple two-period model with imperfect information about foreign demand,
in which firms’ beliefs about their foreign demand are determined by learning from neighbors. The model predicts that a high variance of the prior distribution of foreign demand
induces firms to enter new markets, as the profit function is convex in perceived foreign
demand due to the option of exiting. We then use our micro data to empirically examine
several model predictions, and find supporting evidence that firms’ high entries and exits
are outcomes of their rational self-discovery of demand in an unfamiliar market.
In research in progress, we extend the model to a dynamic one and structurally estimate the key parameters in the model. The goal is to quantitatively assess the value of
information offered by neighboring firms and the option value of waiting to enter different
foreign markets.

Appendix

9.1

Proof of Proposition 1

Using a change of variable x = µ + σ, we have
Z
V (ϕ) =

max{µ + σ + ϕ − f, 0}φ()d = (µ + ϕ − f )Φ((µ + ϕ − f )/σ) + σφ((µ + ϕ − f )/σ).

Define W (µ, σ, ϕ) = µ + ϕ − f + β(µ + ϕ − f )Φ((µ + ϕ − f )/σ) + σφ((µ + ϕ − f )/σ).
Taking a derivative of W (µ, σ, ϕ) with respect to ϕ, µ, (1/σ), while noting the property of
the standard normal density function φ0 (t) = −tφ(t), we have

∂W (µ, σ, ϕ)
= 1 + βΦ((µ + ϕ − f )/σ) + ((µ + ϕ − f )/σ)φ((µ + ϕ − f )/σ) − ((µ + ϕ − f )/σ)φ((µ + ϕ − f )/σ
∂ϕ
= 1 + βΦ((µ + ϕ − f )/σ) > 0,
∂W (µ, σ, ϕ)
= 1 + βΦ((µ + ϕ − f )/σ) > 0,
∂µ
∂W (µ, σ, ϕ)
= (µ + ϕ − f )2 φ((µ + ϕ − f )/σ) − σ 2 φ((µ + ϕ − f )/σ) − (µ + ϕ − f )2 φ((µ + ϕ − f )/σ)
∂(1/σ)
= −σ 2 φ((µ + ϕ − f )/σ) < 0.
∂W (µ,σ,ϕ)
> 0.
∂σ
W (µ, σ, ϕ∗1 (µ, σ)) = 0. It

Note that the last equation implies that
Define ϕ∗1 (µ, σ) implicitly by

follows from the implicit function

theorem and ∂W/∂ϕ, ∂W/∂µ, ∂W/∂σ > 0 that we have ∂ϕ∗1 /∂µ = −(∂W/∂µ)/(∂W/∂ϕ) <
0 and ∂ϕ∗1 /∂σ = −(∂W/∂σ)/(∂W/∂ϕ) < 0. 

9.2

Proof of Proposition 5

Note that µ + ϕ − f − K + βEx [max{µ + ϕ − f, 0}] is strictly increasing function of ϕ.
Then, the stated result follows from βEx [max{µ + ϕ − f − K, 0}] > 0.

The sample contains firms that first started exporting to a market (a country-HS2 pair) in 2001, but not in 2000. A sector (HS2) is considered differentiated based on
Rauch's (1999) classification (see Section 4 for details). Countries that have distance from China above the sample median are considered distant countries, while those
with distance below the median are considered nearby destinations.

The sample includes all city-country-sector pairs in which Chinese firms ever started exporting in a new market during the 2002-2004 period,
but did not export in the previous two years (i.e., t-1 and t-2). The sample is constructed in a way eliminate temporal exiters that
immediately re-entered in t+1, in light of the findings in Table 3. A market is defined as a country-sector pair, while a firm's neighborhood is
defined as the city in which it operates. Standard errors are clustered by city and are robust to clustering at other levels. T-statistics are
reported in parentheses.

The sample considers markets in the 46 Sub-Saharan African countries. The restricted sample includes all new country-sector pairs in which
Chinese firms could potentially enter during the 2002-2006 period, but did not sell in the previous two years (i.e., t-1 and t-2). Existing
exporters are dropped from the sample, so that a firm's entry propensity is compared with "no entry". Standard errors are clusterd at the
city-destination level, and are robust to clustering at other levels. T-statistics are reported in parentheses.
