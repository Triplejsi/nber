The Macroeconomics of the Greek Depression

ABSTRACT
The Greek economy experienced a boom until 2007, followed by a prolonged depression
resulting in a 25 percent shortfall of GDP by 2016. Informed by a detailed analysis of
macroeconomic patterns in Greece, we estimate a rich dynamic general equilibrium model to
assess quantitatively the sources of the boom and bust. Lower external demand for traded goods
and contractionary fiscal policies account for the largest fraction of the Greek depression. A
decline in total factor productivity, due primarily to lower factor utilization, substantially
amplifies the depression. Given the significant adjustment of prices and wages observed
throughout the cycle, a nominal devaluation would only have short-lived stabilizing effects. By
contrast, shifting the burden of adjustment away from taxes toward spending or away from capital
taxes toward other taxes would generate longer-term production and consumption gains.
Eliminating the rise in transfers to households during the boom would significantly reduce the
burden of tax adjustment in the bust and the magnitude of the depression.

Introduction

The Greek economy experienced a significant boom between 1999 and 2007, with real GDP per
capita growing by 34 percent, followed by a sustained depression, with real GDP per capita
contracting by 25 percent between 2007 and 2016. The magnitude and length of the depression and
the ensuing fiscal adjustment have no precedent among modern developed economies. The severity
is atypical even among economies experiencing sudden stops, sovereign defaults, or leverage cycles
(Gourinchas, Philippon, and Vayanos, 2016).
In this paper we ask two set of questions. First, what are the driving forces of the Greek boom
and bust and how important are frictions such as in the adjustment of nominal prices and wages or
in financial markets for amplifying the effects of shocks? Second, to what extent would exchange
rate devaluation or alternative fiscal policy have mitigated the depression?
Answering these questions is important for reasons that extend beyond the Greek case. The
macroeconomics of great depressions (Kehoe and Prescott, 2002) has received less scholarly attention than analyses of typical business cycles possibly because contractions as large as in Greece
rarely occur. The recent international business cycle literature attributes a role to price or wage
rigidities (Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2016) and financial frictions (Neumeyer and Perri, 2005; Mendoza, 2010) for understanding economic fluctuations when shocks are relatively small, but the role
of rigidities and frictions may change with the magnitude and persistence of the recession. Likewise, the literature evaluating fiscal consolidations (Alesina and Ardagna, 2010) typically focuses
on smaller contractions. Greece provides a unique case study of a developed economy undergoing
large fiscal adjustments during a crisis of unprecedented magnitude.
We answer these questions quantitatively by developing and estimating a rich dynamic general
equilibrium model of a small open economy operating within a currency union. We inform the
model environment, the shocks influencing the economy, and the estimation of parameters with a
detailed analysis of macroeconomic patterns in Greece during both the boom and the bust periods.
Several features of the Greek experience are important to our analysis. First, the boom period
is characterized by an increase in labor and capital accumulation, whereas both declines in factors
of production and total factor productivity (TFP) contribute to the bust of economic activity. We
document that a significant fraction of the decline in TFP stems from the decline in the utilization
of factors of production. The comovement of TFP and utilization informs our model economy in

1

which endogenous TFP movements arise from firms’ choice of how intensively to utilize factors.
Firm and household leverage increase significantly during the boom. Household leverage decreases throughout the bust, but firm leverage rebounds after a few years. These financial cycles
occur in quantities rather than prices; while the secondary market interest rate for Greek sovereign
debt rose to as high as 30 percent in 2012, the average rate paid by non-financial firms in that
year barely exceeded 6 percent. The model, therefore, features quantity restrictions on borrowing.
Financial conditions also motivate disaster risk in the model. Using option prices, we infer an
elevated risk of an economic disaster coinciding with major events such as the debt restructuring
in 2012 and the election and fiscal negotiations in 2015.
We model in detail fiscal policies motivated by the fact that the burden of the adjustment fell
on both spending and taxes. Government purchases and transfers to households rise during the
boom and fall precipitously during the bust even relative to GDP. Building on the methodology of
Mendoza, Razin, and Tesar (1994), we construct effective tax rates on consumption, investment,
labor, and capital. All tax rates rise sharply during the bust and remain elevated through 2016.
For example, the capital tax rate in the non-traded sector, which includes property taxes, increases
by roughly 20 percentage points in the last years of our sample.
While measures of production comove strongly between the traded and non-traded sectors,
the dynamics of the terms of trade and real exchange rate lead us to consider a multi-sector
environment as well as changes in the external demand for Greek traded goods. The considerable
terms of trade appreciation during the boom motivates our modeling of Greek traded output as
imperfectly substitutable with traded goods produced by the rest of the world. Using observed
changes in exports and relative prices, we find a significant increase in external demand for Greek
traded goods during the boom, a period coinciding with the entry of Greece to the euro and the
hosting of the Olympic Games, and a significant decline during the bust, a period coinciding with
a global slump in shipping that particularly impacted Greece.
We use the model to account for the drivers of the boom and bust. Our approach differs from
estimated dynamic general equilibrium models in the tradition of Smets and Wouters (2007) in that
we do not estimate the shocks that best fit macroeconomic data. Rather, we feed the time series of
the exogenous processes as measured in the data without adding to them any measurement error
and then estimate parameters with Bayesian Maximum Likelihood. This disciplines significantly
our exercise as it restricts the freedom of shocks to account for the behavior of time series. Despite
2

this discipline, the model performs well in accounting for the time series. The model accounts
perfectly for the 11 percent increase in output in the boom (relative to 2 percent trend growth) and
matches closely the contributions of labor, capital, and TFP. During the bust, the model generates
an output decline of 30 percent (compared to 45 percent in the detrended data), a decline in labor
of 16 percent (17 percent in the data), a decline in capital of 11 percent (19 percent in the data),
and a decline in TFP of 17 percent (26 percent in the data).
What shocks drive the Greek boom and bust? In the absence of innovations to government
spending, transfers, and tax rates, output in the estimated model would have been 15 percent
higher in 2016.1 Government spending cuts manifest mainly through declines in labor, whereas
increases in tax rates manifest mainly through declines in capital and TFP. We find a significant
role for external demand and, to a lesser extent, exogenous productivity during both the boom
and bust. Financial conditions, such as firm and household leverage, interest rates, and disaster
risk, partly account for the boom and the initial bust of macroeconomic variables. However,
because these variables mostly revert back to their pre-crisis levels by the end of the sample, they
collectively exert a limited role in accounting for the persistence of the Greek depression.
We provide an account of the structural elements of the model responsible for these conclusions.
Without variable utilization, the model would generate 13 percentage points smaller declines in
output and TFP by the end of the sample. By contrast, we find a limited role for price or wage
rigidity in accounting for the magnitude of the boom and the persistence of the bust, reflecting
the significant increase in nominal prices (11 percent relative to euro trend inflation) and wages
(24 percent relative to trend) in the boom and decline in the bust (4 and 39 percent relative
to trend). The observed shocks generate significant movements in labor without a high Frisch
elasticity of labor supply (estimated at 0.48) or sensitivity of labor demand to firm borrowing
constraints. Finally, we estimate a relatively high fraction of households who are constrained at
their borrowing limit (0.43) and a strong complementarity between consumption and labor in
preferences, both of which contribute to the consumption decline during the bust.
1
We take the fiscal consolidation as given and quantify its macroeconomic effects. The fiscal consolidation itself
was triggered by a combination of the 2008-2009 recession and the budget deficit revisions announced in October
2009 and became necessary due to the high pre-existing level of public debt. Martin and Philippon (2017) have
adopted this interpretation of fiscal consolidations in periphery euro economies. Viewed through these lens, 15
percent should be interpreted as the gain in output if pre-existing conditions such as high debt level had not
made the fiscal adjustment necessary or, alternatively, if Greece had received substantial additional debt relief.
Ardagna and Caselli (2014) discuss further the political economy of the early stages of the Greek debt crisis and
the negotiations with external creditors and institutions that influenced the fiscal adjustment.

3

The model generates modest government spending multipliers, with a unit increase in government spending raising output contemporaneously by 0.5 when financed by lump sum taxes
and by 0.9 when financed with deficits. The most important parameter governing the multiplier
in the presence of nominal rigidity is the persistence of government spending shocks because it
determines the amount of crowding out of private consumption. Lowering the persistence in the
autoregressive process from close to 1 in our baseline to 0.3 raises these impact multipliers to
roughly 1.3. Conversely, the model generates larger tax multipliers over longer horizons and when
tax rate changes are more persistent. The seven-year percent decline in output in response to a
one percentage point increase in the labor tax rate is 0.35 and in the capital tax rate is close to
0.15. Variable utilization plays an important role for tax multipliers through its impact on TFP.
We consider three sets of counterfactual exercises to evaluate the benefits of alternative policies
during the bust. The first is a nominal devaluation in 2010. This policy raises output on impact
through an expenditure-switching channel. However, given the low estimated degree of nominal
price and wage rigidity, a nominal devaluation boosts the economy only for one to two years. There
is larger scope for mitigating the bust in output if Greece had followed different compositions of
fiscal policy in order to achieve the observed reduction in deficits. A shift of the burden of fiscal
consolidation in 2010 away from tax increases toward spending cuts raises output by close to
3 percent by 2016 and 2025. Alternatively, shifting away from labor and capital taxes toward
consumption taxes generates output gains of almost 6 percent by 2025. Finally, we highlight the
benefits of running less expansionary fiscal policies during the boom. Removing the debt-financed
rise of household transfers during the boom and reallocating the freed-up resources to reduce
capital taxes during the bust would generate output gains of 15 percent by 2016.2
The seminal paper of Gourinchas, Philippon, and Vayanos (2016) provides the first systematic
analysis of macroeconomic aspects of the Greek depression. Confirming quantitatively a broad
message of their analysis, we also attribute roughly half of the bust in output to fiscal consolidation.
Whereas they use total revenues to infer the time series properties of a single income tax rate,
our modeling and measurement of different tax rates leads to the more nuanced conclusion that
2

Our analysis of the effects of capital income taxes is in line with the conclusions of Mendoza, Tesar, and Zhang
(2014) that have first highlighted the importance of dynamic Laffer curve effects with respect to capital income tax
rates in open economy models with variable utilization. Our results also corroborates the analysis of Martin and
Philippon (2017) who demonstrate that if Greece had followed more conservative fiscal policies during the boom,
the ensuing fiscal consolidation would have been smaller and employment would have dropped by substantially less
between 2010 and 2012.

4

the tax side is at least as important as the spending side of the consolidation, especially in the
later years of the depression. Another important departure from their work is that, in our model,
endogenous movements in TFP from utilization emerge as a key propagation mechanism of the
various shocks whereas they impose constant TFP.3 Finally, Gourinchas, Philippon, and Vayanos
(2016) externally set parameters implying a relatively high degree of price and wage rigidity and
find that these rigidities help the model generate the boom and bust. We estimate the strength of
these rigidities using observed quantities and prices and find a smaller role for nominal rigidities
relative to other features of the model economy.4
The Greek experience contrasts with earlier narratives of the boom and bust in the broader euro
area. For example, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016) emphasize the problem of downward nominal
wage rigidity in preventing internal devaluation for several countries including Greece between
2008 and 2011, yet in Greece nominal wages (not detrended) fell by 18 percent from their peak in
2010 and nominal prices (not detrended) fell by 7 percent from their peak in 2012. This difference
suggests that downward wage rigidity may depend on the persistence and severity of shocks. The
misallocation literature in the euro area (Gopinath, Kalemli-Ozcan, Karabarbounis, and VillegasSanchez, 2017) emphasizes declines in TFP and the deterioration of resource allocation in Spain
and Italy before the crisis, but for various Greek industries we do not observe significant declines in
trend TFP during the boom. The strong comovement between the traded and non-traded sector
and the fact that Greek traded output has not recovered despite a decline in wages challenge
narratives of slow economic growth focused on non-traded sectors such as the government or
housing.5 To generate this comovement, our quantitative model attributes an important role
to supply-side influences such as tax rates and supply-side amplification mechanisms such as
utilization. Our emphasis on utilization to reconcile movements in output and factor inputs echoes
3

Consistent with both our and the Gourinchas, Philippon, and Vayanos (2016) results, Economides, Philippopoulos, and Papageorgiou (2017) also attribute a substantial role to fiscal consolidation for the bust. Dellas,
Malliaropulos, Papageorgiou, and Vourvachaki (2018) highlight the tax side of the fiscal consolidation and the
amplification of the decline in measured economic activity by a sizable informal sector. Relative to these papers,
we examine both the origins of the boom and the bust, study the propagation of fiscal shocks through endogenous changes in TFP, and allow external demand, price and wage rigidity, and financial forces to play a role.
Fakos, Sakellaris, and Tavares (2018) present firm-level evidence that roughly half of the decline in manufacturing
investment is accounted for by tighter credit constraints and the other half by lower productivity and demand.
4
Additionally, Gourinchas, Philippon, and Vayanos (2016) infer a significant increase in the price markup shock
that accounts for the lack of recovery in economic activity and a significant decrease in the wage markup shock
that accounts for the decline in wages, whereas these shocks are absent from our analysis.
5
Arkolakis, Doxiadis, and Galenianos (2017) document the difference between the experiences of Ireland, Portugal and Spain where most of the external adjustment is accounted for by increases in exports and the experience
of Greece where all of the external adjustment is accounted for by a decline in imports.

Model

We model Greece as a small open economy within a currency union. We quote domestic prices
and values in domestic currency and use asterisks for variables denominated in foreign currency
which is the euro. The small open economy takes as given the interest rate i∗t on euro-denominated
∗
debt and the euro price PF,t
of imported goods. Given that Greece uses the euro for most of our

sample period, we let the exchange rate between domestic currency and the euro be Et = 1. As
a result, the interest rate on debt denominated in domestic currency equals it = i∗t . The law
of one price holds for traded goods, so the domestic price of foreign traded goods is given by
∗
∗
. For our counterfactual analyses in which Greece exits the euro and devalues
= PF,t
PF,t = Et PF,t
∗
unexpectedly, the change in Et introduces a wedge between PF,t and PF,t
.

2.1

Households

Household heterogeneity. There is a measure one of workers i ∈ [0, 1]. Workers belong to two
types of households h = {r, o}. A constant fraction ζ of households are relatively impatient and
discount with factor β r and a fraction 1 − ζ of households are more patient and discount with
factor β o > β r . In steady state, impatient households choose to borrow as much as possible and do
not hold firm shares, whereas patient households choose bonds and share holdings in an interior
solution. Anticipating this result, we label households as rule-of-thumb r and optimizing o.6
Preferences. There is full insurance within each household and, thus, consumptions are
equalized cht (i) = cht for all members i ∈ I(h) belonging to household h. Members of the household
supply differentiated labor services `ht (i) to the market. Household h values flows of consumption
and labor from its members according to:

We motivate the inclusion of rule-of-thumb households into the model by referring to the empirical evidence

population requires an average annual marginal propensity to consume of 0.34.

elasticity of labor supply. The latter is used, among others, by Shimer (2010) and Trabandt
and Uhlig (2011) and is consistent with a balanced growth with constant hours. Parameter χ > 0
governs the disutility of labor, σ > 0 governs risk aversion, and  > 0 is the Frisch elasticity of labor
supply. Parameter ρ > 0 governs both the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption
and the complementarity between consumption and labor. When ρ → 1 preferences are separable
between consumption and labor and when ρ < 1 consumption and labor are complements.
Consumption is a CES aggregator of traded cT and non-traded cN goods, where traded goods
are a CES aggregator of home-produced cH and foreign-produced cF goods:

is the bundle of labor for each type of household h with an

elasticity of substitution across varieties εw > 1. In equation (4), Wth (i) denotes the cost of hiring
one unit of `ht (i). The perfect substitutability between `rt and `ot implies a common wage Wt for
both types of households. Workers in each household are symmetric and share consumption risks
and, thus, in equilibrium we obtain `ht = `ht (i) and Wt = Wtr (i) = Wto (i).

Influential work in the open economy by Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016) emphasizes downward nominal
wage rigidity of the form Wt ≥ γWt−1 , where parameter γ disciplines the extent of rigidity. We adopt quadratic
adjustment costs in part because this specification allows us to use standard perturbation methods to solve the
model and then estimate its parameters. We acknowledge the qualitative difference between our specification and
downward nominal wage rigidity, but wish to highlight that our inference of relatively flexible nominal wages is
informed by their 18 percent decline (when not detrended) between 2010 and 2016. In Appendix B.4 we demonstrate
that using sample windows after 2008-2011 leads to lower estimates of γ than in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016).

Firms

There are two types of firms. Production is done by intermediate goods firms who use labor and
capital to supply traded yH and non-traded yN goods to retailers. Price setting is done by retailers,
who transform these intermediate inputs into differentiated traded goods yH (j) sold to domestic
households, production firms, and the rest of the world and differentiated non-traded goods yN (j)
sold to domestic households and the government.
Production. Production of traded and non-traded intermediate goods is Cobb-Douglas:10
yH,t = zH,t uH,t (st kt )αH (`H,t )1−αH , yN,t = zN,t uN,t ((1 − st )kt )αN (`N,t )1−αN ,

(8)

where αH , αN ∈ (0, 1) govern the shares of capital income and zH and zN denote exogenous
productivity in each sector.
Firms hire labor inputs `H,t and `N,t at a wage Wt . Production uses capital kt , with fraction st
allocated to the traded sector and fraction 1−st allocated to the non-traded sector.11 Motivated by
the observation that the significant drop in sectoral TFP (as measured by Solow residuals) in the
bust coincides with declines in utilization, we allow firms to choose endogenously the utilization
of factors uH and uN in production. The cost of utilizing factors more intensively is increased

The representative firm setup is appropriate in our context given that declines in value added and employment
in the bust occurred throughout the firm size distribution (Appendix Figure B.1). Additionally, for almost all
industries, the decline in labor productivity is accounted for by declines in labor productivity within size class
rather than by a reallocation of economic activity across firms of different sizes (Appendix Figure B.2).

We model the allocation of capital st without adjustment costs because the time series generated by the model
are not significantly affected by these adjustment costs and, thus, parameters of the adjustment cost technology

The baseline specification of Jermann and Quadrini (2012) features intraperiod loans on output instead of the
wage bill. However, they show that this difference is relatively immaterial for the quantitative effects of θt shocks
on the model-generated time series of output and labor. Similarly to them, we write equation (11) with equality
assuming that the financial constraint always binds. In the steady state of our model the borrowing constraint
always binds because interest expenses are deducted from taxes and financing production with debt maximizes firm
value. We assume that the constraint also binds in an approximation around the steady state, which allows us to
infer θt directly from equation (11). The most important difference is that Jermann and Quadrini (2012) impose
κ = 1, whereas we estimate κ = 0.12 because in the data the comovement between firm leverage θt and labor
`t ≡ `H,t + `N,t is weak.

Driving Forces

The first set of exogenous processes consists of sectoral productivities log zH,t and log zN,t . The

second set includes rest of the world demand for Greek goods āT,t and the price of imports PF,t
.

Financial processes include government debt log Btg , the borrowing limit of rule-of-thumb households log B̄tr , the interest rate rt∗ on public debt, the interest rate i∗t on private debt, and the
fraction θt of the value of capital firms use as collateral to borrow. Finally, fiscal processes include
government spending log gt , transfers to rule-of-thumb households log Ttr , and tax rates τtc , τtl , τtx ,

To these forces we add a rare disaster following Gourio (2012). We motivate the possibility of
rare disasters by the elevated uncertainty Greece experienced around 2012 and 2015 during the
debt negotiations and the possibility of exit from the euro.15 A disaster event moves the economy
permanently to a state in which the levels of variables such as productivity and external demand
scale down by a factor exp(−ϕ) < 1 (see Appendix A.2 for details). Disasters occur with timevarying probability πt . To discipline our quantitative exercise, we fix ϕ to a constant and assume a
disaster does not actually occur in sample. Instead, we consider only the impact of changes in the
probability of a disaster πt as estimated from options data. An increase in πt is equivalent to an ino

crease in the effective discount factor of optimizing households, β (1 − πt + πt exp((σ − 1)ϕ))

The exogenous processes are collected in vector zt and follow an autoregressive process:

where z̄ is a constant that depends on steady state values and the size of the disaster ϕ, R is
a diagonal matrix containing the persistence of each stochastic process, Σ is a diagonal matrix
containing the standard deviations of the innovations, and the vector of innovations νt+1 ∼ N(0, I).

the government budget constraint (15) holds. We let transfers to optimizing households Tto adjust
endogenously to satisfy the government budget constraint (15).
Appendix A.1 collects all conditions in the symmetric equilibrium of the model.16 We solve the
model using a first-order approximation of the equilibrium conditions around the steady state. We
prefer a first-order approximation because it facilitates the estimation of parameters. Appendix
Figure C.1 shows that, for given parameters, paths of model-generated variables do not differ significantly between the first-order, second-order, and third-order approximations of the equilibrium
conditions.

Measurement

Our sample covers the period between 1998 and 2016. We use 1998 as a burn-in period to initiate
the dynamics of the model from steady state and display time series beginning from 1999 when the
euro area was formed. We divide all quantities by total population in Greece. To account for trend
growth we deflate per capita quantities with 2 percent per year, which is the average growth rate
16

The equilibrium is symmetric across types of labor services, so we obtain `rt (i) = `rt , `ot (i) = `ot , and Wtr (i) =
= Wt . The equilibrium is symmetric across varieties of traded and non-traded goods, so we also obtain
yH,t (j) = yH,t , yN,t (j) = yN,t , crH,t (j) = crH,t , coH,t (j) = coH,t , crN,t (j) = crN,t , coN,t (j) = coN,t , gt (j) = gt , ΠH,t (j) =
ΠH,t , ΠN,t (j) = ΠN,t , PH,t (j) = PH,t , and PN,t (j) = PN,t .

of constant-price GDP per capita in Greece between 1970 and 1998 from the Penn World Tables.
To account for trend inflation we deflate prices and interest rates with 1 percent per year, which is
the average euro inflation rate during our sample. Values and nominal wages are deflated with 3
percent per year. Finally, we deflate productivity measures with ((1 + 0.02)0.46 − 1) ≈ 0.9 percent
per year, where 0.46 is the mean labor share observed in our sample. While we prefer to detrend
variables to account for trend growth and inflation, we also report results without detrending in
sensitivity analyses below.

3.1

Outcomes

We begin by describing the measurement and evolution of outcome variables used to estimate
and evaluate the model. Figure 1 presents their deviations from 1999 values. We use 11 outcome
variables to estimate 11 parameters and collect the time series in a vector:


PN
, log Py , log W .
y = log `H , log `N , log uH , log uN , log k̃, s, log c, log(PN cN ), log
PT

(17)

We obtain constant-price total output y and its price Py from the Eurostat National Accounts
ESA 2010 database.17 The traded sector consists of agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transportation, and accommodation and food services. The latter belong to the traded sector because
a significant fraction of economic activity in accommodation and food services in Greece is related
to tourism. Denoting the current-price value added of industry i by Pi yi , we sum up value added
P
for traded goods PH yH = i∈H Pi yi , construct their price PH as the Paasche price index of the
underlying prices Pi , and obtain constant-price value added yH as the ratio of the two. We follow
a similar procedure to measure PN and yN . Figure 1(a) shows strong comovement between yH
and yN over time. Both variables increase up to 2007, decline by roughly 30 percent between 2007
and 2012, and do not recover after 2012.
Labor inputs `H and `N are total hours worked per capita in each sector. These measures
include both employee hours and hours of the self-employed. The underlying source data come
from national surveys of households and establishments. As Figure 1(b) shows, both labor inputs
fell by roughly 15 percent after 2008 despite their divergence over the first part of the sample.
Labor inputs have recovered only weakly in the last years of the sample.

Figure 1 plots the evolution of macroeconomic variables relative to 1999. H denotes the traded sector for production
measures and T for consumption measures. N denotes the non-traded sector. y is output, ` is labor, k̃ is the capital
stock, s is the share of capital in the traded sector, TFP is total factor productivity, u is utilization, c is consumption,
PN /PT is the price of non-traded goods relative to traded goods, PF /PH is price of foreign to domestic traded
goods (terms of trade), Py is price of output, Pc is price of consumption, and W is the wage. Quantities are
detrended with 2 percent per year, prices with 1 percent, TFP with 0.9 percent, wages with 3 percent.

To construct the stock of capital, we use the perpetual inventory method with a fixed depreciation rate for each of four types of assets (structures, machinery and equipment, cultivated
biological resources, and intellectual property assets) and the time series of constant-price investment x from the national accounts. We denote this variable by k̃t = (1 − δ̄)k̃t−1 + xt to distinguish
it from the variable k in the model which accounts for variable depreciation due to utilization. We
measure the share of capital allocated to the traded sector s using Eurostat industry-level fixed
asset accounts. Figure 1(c) shows a roughly 10 percent increase in capital during the boom period,
followed by a roughly 20 percent decline after 2010. The significant decline in the capital stock
reflects a more than 80 percent collapse of investment between 2008 and 2016. By contrast, the
share of capital across sectors remains relatively stable over time.
We obtain total factor productivities using a growth accounting approach (see Appendix B.2
for details). Within each sector, we use a constant returns to scale production function with timevarying income shares that maps labor and capital services into value added. To construct capital
services, we aggregate the four type of assets using user cost weights that depend on asset-specific
depreciation rates and a common required net return. These measures capture both withinindustry productivity and the reallocation of inputs across industries within sectors.18 Figure 1(d)
shows the evolution of sectoral and aggregate TFP. Relative to trend, TFP in the traded sector
increases in the first years of the sample whereas TFP in the non-traded sector decreases slightly.
Both TFP indices decrease substantially during the bust period and do not recover.
Measures of utilization uH and uN come from two Joint Harmonised European Commission
Surveys. We average the quarterly responses to the Industry Survey question “At what capacity is
your company currently operating (as a percentage of full capacity)?” to obtain utilization in the
manufacturing sector. For services industries, we use the question added in 2011 to the Services
Survey: “If the demand expanded, could you increase your volume of activity with your present
resources? If so, by how much?”. We use the fraction of respondents reporting “None” to the
question “What main factors are currently limiting your business?” to extend this measure back in
time.19 We then aggregate within sectors to obtain uH and uN . Figure 1(e) shows that utilization
18

Applying the Basu (1996) decomposition of total factor productivity into a within industry component and a
between industry component, we find a relatively small role for reallocation across industries in accounting for the
dynamics of total factor productivity at the sectoral or aggregate level.
19
In Appendix B.2, we present an alternative series for utilization based on Basu (1996). This approach relates
unobserved utilization to the growth of materials inputs. Our baseline survey measures and the implied utilization
measures from this alternative approach yield consistent time series for utilization and, in particular, both measures
show a sharp decline in utilization during the bust period.

16

declined substantially in both sectors between 2007 and 2012 and remained depressed thereafter.
We measure current-price consumption of non-traded goods as value added of non-traded
output less government purchases of consumption and investment, PN cN = PN yN − PN gt . Consumption expenditure on traded goods is, therefore, PT cT = Pc c−PN cN , where Pc c is current-price
consumption of households and non-profits. We obtain cN using the Paasche index PN from the
underlying industry prices that comprise the non-traded sector, cT using the Paasche price index
PT from the price of domestic traded goods PH and the price of foreign traded goods PF , and c
from the consumption price index Pc .20 Figure 1(f) displays a consumption boom in until 2007
and then a significant decline and lack of recovery. Expenditure on non-traded goods comprises
roughly 70 percent of total expenditure and, thus, total consumption comoves more closely with
non-traded consumption than with traded consumption.
Figures 1(g) and 1(h) display the evolution of prices and wages. Until 2008, the relative price
of non-traded goods was increasing and the Greek terms of trade was appreciating. These trends
reverse after 2010. Relative to their corresponding trends, the Greek price indices of output and
consumption increased by roughly 10 percent in the first part of the sample and declined by
roughly the same amount in the second part. Finally, relative to their trend, wages increased by
more than 20 percent by 2010 and then declined by more than 30 percent. We measure wages as
total employee compensation divided by total employee hours. In Appendix B.3 we document that
this measure correlates highly with other wage series available for Greece including the Eurostat
Labor Cost Index and the quadrennial Structure of Earnings Survey, that both public and private
sector employees experienced declines in nominal wages after 2010, and that significant nominal
wage declines occur across all age groups, skill categories, and throughout the wage distribution.

Driving Forces

We next describe the measurement of the exogenous processes that drive the model:

z = log zH , log zN , log āT , log PF∗ , log B g , log B̄ r , r∗ , i∗ , θ, π, log g, log T r , τ c , τ x , τ ` , τHk , τNk .

(18)

Productivity. We obtain (utilization-adjusted) traded and non-traded productivity, zH and
zN , by subtracting the contribution of utilizations, uH and uN , from the TFP measures displayed
20

As in the model, these price indices are basic meaning that they exclude indirect taxes. Expenditure series
and price indices in national accounts are at market prices, meaning that they map into to (1 + τ c ) Pc . We use our
series on the consumption tax rate τ c described below to obtain Pc from the national accounts price index.

in Figure 1. Figure 2(a) shows that traded productivity zH increases in the first years of the sample
and then decreases significantly during the bust period. By contrast, non-traded productivity zN
does not display systematic fluctuations over the sample.
External demand. We measure external demand āT for Greek goods using equation (13) in
the symmetric equilibrium of the model:

η−1


PT,t
PF,t
PH,t yH,t = γ
PT,t (cT,t + xt ) + (1 − γ)
PF,t āT,t .
PH,t
PH,t

(19)

Given values γ = 0.24 and η = 1.65 that we estimate below, we populate this equation with traded
value added PH yH , traded domestic demand PT (cT + x), and prices of traded goods PH and PF to
solve for external demand āT . Figure 2(b) displays a roughly 20 percent increase in āT from the
beginning of the sample until 2008, followed by a cumulative decline of roughly 30 percent until
the end of the sample. To understand this behavior of āT , equation (19) decomposes the value of
Greek production of traded goods into the value of the domestic absorption of Greek traded goods
(the first term) and the value of exports (the second term). Given a trade elasticity η > 1, Greek
exports increase when the terms of trade PF /PH depreciate. Figure 1(g) shows an appreciation
of PF /PH in the first part of the sample and a depreciation after roughly 2010. In the absence of
movements in external demand āT , the behavior of the terms of trade would generate a decrease
in Greek exports initially and then an increase. As a result, the increase and then decline in āT
rationalizes the increase and then decline in exports, given the behavior of the terms of trade.21
The increase in āT over the first part of the sample coincides with the entry of Greece into
the euro area and the hosting of the Olympic Games. The bust of āT coincides with a period
of depressed global demand. In Appendix B.5, we further investigate the bust period and document that the lack of recovery in exports is concentrated in the Greek shipping industry (water
transportation). Kalouptsidi (2014) documents substantial increases in freight rates globally and
a surge in the new ship backlog between 2003 and 2008 driven by a growth of raw material imports
particularly in China. Given substantial time to build constraints, she argues that the 2008 crisis
21
Since PH yH is value added in the Greek traded sector, the second term in equation (19) corresponds to valueadded exports and not gross exports as reported in the national income accounts. Value-added exports differ from
gross exports because of imports of intermediate goods used in the production of gross exports. For example,
Greece imports crude petroleum and exports refined petroleum products. Accordingly, we could have obtained
āT using data on the value-added content of exports from input-output data and the procedure of Johnson and
Noguera (2012). Appendix Figure B.5 shows that the value-added export series and the implied āT obtained from
equation (19) are comparable to alternative series for value-added exports and āT using data from the World
Input-Output Database. Our preferred measure understates the importance of āT during the boom years. The two
measures display similar declines during the bust period and neither measure recovers by the end of the sample.

led to a persistent decline in freight rates and the idling of the existing fleet. These developments
are consistent with a persistent decline in āT after 2008.
Financial conditions. Figure 2(c) plots the evolution of government debt B g from flow of
funds data reported by the Greek Central Bank. Government debt B g is the market value of debt
and loans at all maturities net of assets, currency held, and deposits. The visible decline in B g
in the figure reflects the mid-2011 announcement that private lenders would incur a roughly 20
percent decline in the net present value of their bond holdings. The increase in B g after 2012
to pre-2011 levels reflects the long-term loans made to Greece by the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund under the second bailout program in the beginning of 2012.
Figure 2(c) also plots the borrowing limit of rule-of-thumb households B̄ r . We measure B̄ r
with household short-term liabilities in loans and other payables from the flow of funds. Thus,
we assume that constrained households use short-term liabilities to finance their consumption
expenditures and unconstrained households incur only long-term liabilities, to which we add assets,
currency, and deposits to arrive at B o . Figure 2(c) shows the leveraging cycle for rule-of-thumb
households who increased their borrowing by roughly 80 percent until 2010 and then decreased it
by roughly 60 percent by the end of the sample.
Figure 2(d) plots the evolution of government r∗ and private i∗ interest rates. We measure
r∗ as an effective interest rate on government debt by dividing (net) interest payments by the
government from the national accounts to the market value of debt B g from the flow of funds.
The interest rate i∗ is the interest rate on loans with duration less than one year for non-financial
corporations available from the European Central Bank. Consistent with the experience of other
Southern economies of the euro area, both interest rates exhibit a downward trend over time with
most of the decline concentrated in the first years of the sample.
We invert equation (11) to measure firm-level leverage θ =

Btf +κWt `t
Qkt kt+1

using flow of funds data for

the non-financial corporate sector. The numerator equals debt, loans, and other payable liabilities
less assets, currency held, and deposits. In the denominator, we measure the price of capital Qk
as the ratio of the market value of equity and debt to the replacement cost of all assets (physical
and financial) and we impute capital k for the non-financial corporate sector using the capital of
the business sector available in the national accounts. Figure 2(e) shows a significant increase in θ
until 2007, a decline through 2013, and a recovery since then. The contrast between θ, which would
decline if firms find borrowing prohibitively expensive, and the interest rate i∗ , which does not
20

necessarily increase when firms cannot borrow, demonstrates the importance of modeling changes
in leverage in addition to changes in the interest rates.22
Disaster risk. We follow Barro and Liao (2016) to recover a time series of disaster probabilities
π from prices of far-out-of-the-money put options. A far-out-of-the-money put option pays off only
when stock prices fall by a large amount, so the price of such an option provides information about
the probability a disaster occurs (in which case the option becomes in the money), the size of a
disaster conditional on one occurring, and risk aversion. Appendix B.6 details our implementation
of the Barro and Liao (2016) procedure. Our data contain the universe of put options traded on
the Athens Stock Exchange between 2001 and 2017. The Barro and Liao (2016) model fits the data
well, with an elasticity of the option price to moneyness similar to that found for other countries.
We estimate monthly averages of daily disaster probabilities which we then annualize and average
across months in a year to arrive at our series for π plotted in Figure 2(f). Figure B.6 reports the
monthly series and shows that the peaks of the disaster probability coincide with major political
and economic events during the crisis period.
Government spending. Government purchases of goods and services gt include both ownaccount production and purchases of market goods for consumption and investment. We equate
transfers to rule-of-thumb households Ttr with social benefits to persons which include transfers
such as pensions, health insurance, disability insurance, unemployment insurance, and in-kind
benefits. Figure 2(g) shows that both g and T r rise during the boom, but T r by significantly
more. Both series contract during the bust by roughly 40 percent.
Tax rates. Greece levies taxes on transactions, individuals, corporations, and property. We
allocate all tax receipts and actual social contributions into taxes on consumption, investment,
labor, and capital. Our methodology for measuring tax rates builds on Mendoza, Razin, and
Tesar (1994) who calculate effective tax rates using national income and product accounts. There
are two reasons to use effective rather than statutory tax rates. First, tax evasion in Greece is
rampant.23 Effective tax rates capture changes in tax compliance over time that would otherwise
22
Bocola (2016) emphasizes that, at times of elevated sovereign default risk, banks may perceive firms as riskier
and reduce lending or increase rates. While we think of θ as capturing lending constraints arising both from reduced
bank liquidity and higher perceived risk and, additionally, we allow for elevated disaster risk π in our model, we
acknowledge that θ and π could be affected by policies that reduce risk and by fiscal consolidation.
23
Artavanis, Morse, and Tsoutsoura (2016) use bank-level data to document that in industries with significant
fraction of self-employed, such as accounting, education, law, tourism, and medicine, household debt payments are
close to or exceed reported income. Based on a statistical model of banks’ adaptation to underreporting of income,
they infer that almost half of self-employed income goes unreported.

21

not show up in statutory rates because the European System of National Accounts records taxes
“only when evidenced by tax assessments, declarations ... and missing taxes are not imputed”
(page 106-107 in Eurostat, 2013). Second, income taxes in Greece depend not only on income
but also on so-called objective criteria such as the surface of a house or the type of car engines
individuals own. This feature of the tax code makes it difficult to estimate tax rates accurately
even in the most complete micro datasets. We summarize the most important aspects of our
measurements here and refer the reader to Appendix B.7 for more details.
Taxes on production and imports less subsidies are allocated to consumption and investment,
with the exception of property taxes paid by enterprises which are allocated to capital income.
From taxes on production and imports net of property taxes, we allocate a part that unambiguously falls on consumption and the residual to consumption and investment in proportion to
their expenditure shares. We then calculate the tax rates as τ c =
τx =

investment taxes
.
investment−investment taxes

consumption taxes
consumption−consumption taxes

and

The denominators subtract taxes from spending because in national

accounts spending is at market prices and includes taxes. Figure 2(h) shows that τ c and τ x increase by roughly 4 and 3 percentage points after 2010. This is consistent with the increase in
statutory VAT rates from 19 to 23 percent in 2011 (Eurostat, 2010).
We measure the labor income tax rate τ ` as the sum of the tax rate on social security contributions τ SS =

social security contributions
labor income

contributions τ NL = τ y

and the tax rate on labor income net of social security

contributions
1 − social security
. Labor income in the denominators equals
labor income

compensation of employees, which includes social security contributions, adjusted for the income
of the self-employed that we allocate proportionally between labor and capital. The tax rate
τ NL equals the fraction of labor income not subject to social security contributions taxed at the
individual income tax rate τ y , where:
τy =

2.08 × (taxes on individual income − taxes on dividends and interest)
.
GDP − production/import taxes, contributions, depreciation, dividends, interest

(20)

The individual income tax base includes unambiguous labor income (such as income from salaried
employment), unambiguous capital income (such as dividends, interest, and rentals), and ambiguous income (such as income from self-employment, agriculture, and liberal professions). Equation
(20) excludes dividend and interest from the numerator and denominator because for those types
of capital income we have independent information on tax payments and allocate them directly
to capital taxes. The factor 2.08 in the numerator represents our estimate of the gap between the
22

average marginal tax rate and the average average tax rate.24 Figure 2(h) shows that τ ` increases
by roughly 10 percentage points between 2010 and 2012 and then remains at levels higher prior
to 2010. In Appendix Figure B.7 we document that the timing of these increases coincides well
with the observed increases in statutory income tax rates and that these increases affect especially
lower income households.
We measure capital tax rates τHk and τNk as capital tax payments divided by taxable capital
income generated in each sector. There are six types of capital tax payments. Property taxes paid
by households are allocated to the non-traded sector. Property taxes paid by corporations are
allocated to each sector in proportion to its share of non-residential structures used in production.
The other four categories, taxes on dividends and interest, income and capital gains taxes paid by
corporations, taxes on capital income paid by households, and other capital taxes, are allocated to
each sector in proportion to its share of capital income net of depreciation. Finally, taxable capital
income equals the capital share of GDP less net taxes on products and imports less depreciation.
Figure 2(h) shows a significant increase in both capital taxes after 2012. The increase in τNk exceeds
the increase in τHk , reflecting the significant increase in property taxes falling on the residential
sector after 2011.25

Parameterization

Parameters set without solving the model. Beginning in the upper panel of Table 1, the
coefficient of relative risk aversion is σ = 3, consistent with the Barro and Liao (2016) choice of σ
and our implementation of their methodology for recovering the time-varying disaster probability
π. Using their methodology, we estimate ϕ = 0.24 so that the economy scales down by exp(−ϕ) =
0.79 conditional on a disaster. Goods and labor demand elasticities, εp and εw , are such that in
the flexible price and wage equilibrium markups equal 10 percent, consistent with the range of
estimates reported by Basu and Fernald (1997). We estimate depreciation rates when utilization
takes its mean value, δ̄H = 0.08 and δ̄N = 0.05, using sectoral data on depreciation and capital
24
To estimate this ratio, we use binned up data from the Statistics of Income (SOI) between 2006 and 2011. This
ratio is relatively stable over time. The SOI data has not been publicly disclosed after 2011. Corporate income
taxes are generally flat in Greece and, so, we focus on average capital tax rates. Using the SOI, we have confirmed
that the ratio of marginal to average corporate income tax is close to one.
25
As shown in Appendix Figure B.7, statutory tax rates on corporate income increased from 20 percent to 26
percent in 2013 and to 29 percent in 2016. Taxes for properties with objective values above 400,000 euros in 2011
and 200,000 in 2012 were introduced as part of the fiscal adjustment programs. In 2014, Greece introduced taxes
on the unified property owned by individuals (ENFIA) without exemptions.

The lower panel of Table 1 displays means of exogenous processes that drive the model. We
normalize the levels of traded productivity, external demand, and foreign price to one. The mean
value of all other exogenous processes equals their sample average between 1998 and 2007. We
choose this time frame for estimating the means because disaster risk, fiscal policies, and financial
conditions in Greece before 2008 provide a closer approximation to their long-term values than
the period after 2008 characterized by an unprecedented depression of economic activity. Mean
values of debt and government spending are relative to the value of output, Py y, as our choice of
parameters implies that Py = y = 1 in the steady state of the model.
Parameter estimates of exogenous processes. Table 2 displays estimates of the persis26

For the estimation of the trade elasticity η, our identifying assumption is that preference for Greek relative to
foreign goods γ is uncorrelated with relative prices. We identify the foreign country as the euro area and extend the
procedure in Johnson and Noguera (2012) to recover Greek value-added exports and imports from the euro area.
In Appendix B.8 we describe the details of this procedure and discuss other trading partners, potential differences
between elasticities of exports and imports, and industry aggregation.

tence and standard deviation of the autoregressive processes that we estimate outside the model
using ordinary least squares between 1998 and 2016. Several of the exogenous processes display
high persistence, with some of the fiscal processes exhibiting nearly random walk dynamics.27
Shocks to external demand āT , the borrowing limit of rule-of-thumb households B̄ r , firm leverage
θ, and the probability of disaster π display the largest volatilities.
Parameters calibrated to steady state targets. The upper panel of Table 3 presents
values of parameters calibrated from steady state conditions involving endogenous model variables.
The disutility of labor χ and the shifters in the utilization technologies, ξ¯H and ξ¯N , are chosen to
normalize output and utilizations to one in the steady state of the model. We choose the preference
weight on traded goods ω such that the steady state expenditure share of traded goods equals the
sample average between 1998 and 2007. We calibrate the capital elasticities, αH and αN , such that
the capital-output ratios equal their sample averages over the same period. We choose the mean
value of the debt limit per rule-of-thumb household B̄ r such that, in combination with our estimate
of their fraction ζ in the population, steady state debt accumulated by rule-of-thumb households
over output equals the 1998-2007 sample average value. We choose the mean value of lump sum
transfers to rule-of-thumb households, T r , to equalize consumption per capita in steady state
between the two types of households, cr = co , and the mean value of non-traded productivity zN
to normalize the steady state price of non-traded goods to one. Finally, we calibrate the discount
factor of optimizing households to β o = 0.89 such that the steady state interest rate equals 0.07,
given our estimates of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution ρ, the mean disaster probability
π, and the size of the disaster ϕ. For rule-of-thumb households we set β r = 0.87, which follows
from the result in Carroll, Slacalek, and Tokuoka (2014) that reproducing the observed distribution
of liquid assets in Greece requires a 0.02 gap of discount factors between households.28

11 parameters and use both the vector of outcome variables y and the vector of exogenous processes
z as observables for the estimation. Crucially, we feed the time series of z as measured in the data
prior to the estimation of the parameters and we do not add to them measurement error. This
disciplines our exercise as it restricts the freedom of shocks to account for the behavior of observed
outcome variables. For the estimation, we instead allow for measurement error in each element
of the vector of outcome variables y. We subsequently remove the measurement error component
27

when evaluating the performance of the model and in the counterfactual analyses.
We estimate an intertemporal elasticity of substitution ρ = 0.32, starting from a prior mean of
1, with a tight confidence interval. This parameter also controls the strength of the complementarity between consumption and labor. Our estimate of ρ < 1 accords well with other estimates found
in the literature, including Barsky, Juster, Kimball, and Shapiro (1997) who estimate ρ = 0.18
based on survey responses on intertemporal substitution, Hall (2009) who picks ρ = 0.5 based
on a collection of studies focusing on the observed covariation between consumption growth and
interest rates, and Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis (2016) who estimate ρ = 0.66 based on
the observed decline in consumption upon unemployment. A value of ρ < 1 means that disaster
risk effectively increases households’ patience and makes consumption and labor complements in
the utility function, both of which help the model to match consumption fluctuations.
We estimate an elasticity between traded and non-traded goods of φ = 0.79, starting from a
prior mean of 0.44 from the international business cycle model of Stockman and Tesar (1995).
A value of φ closer to one reflects the relative stability of expenditure shares despite significant
fluctuations in the relative price of non-traded goods. However, the confidence interval for this
parameter is wide and we cannot exclude values as low as 0.3 and as high as 1.3.
We estimate a Frisch elasticity of labor supply of  = 0.48 with a confidence interval ranging
from 0.2 to 0.7. Our observables contain information to identify , since the mean prior was set at
1.5 as a compromise between numerous labor supply studies discussing the role of the extensive
margin and the gap between micro and macro estimates (see, for example, the discussion in Chetty,
Guren, Manoli, and Weber, 2012). We also estimate a small fraction of the wage bill subject to
working capital, κ = 0.12, with a confidence interval that includes the value of 0. As a comparison,
the value of κ = 1 is found in Jermann and Quadrini (2012) in their study of financial sources
in U.S. business cycles and Neumeyer and Perri (2005) in their study of interest rates shocks in
emerging markets. The small κ in our case reflects the weak comovement between labor and firms’
leverage ratio θ. Given the size of shocks hitting the Greek economy and the amplification of these
shocks through variable utilization, the model generates significant fluctuations in labor without
a high  or κ.
We estimate a fraction of rule-of-thumb households equal to ζ = 0.43, with a confidence interval
ranging from 0.3 to 0.5. The significant fraction of rule-of-thumb households reflects the strong
comovement of consumption and labor income over the entire sample. This estimate falls within
28

the set of values that have been used elsewhere in the literature, ranging from 0.25 in Drautzburg
and Uhlig (2015) to 0.5 in Mankiw (2000) and Gali, Lopez-Salido, and Valles (2007). Martin and
Philippon (2017) use the value 0.65 for Greece, based on the fraction of households with liquid
assets below two months of income.
Our estimated elasticities of utilization are ξH = 5.0 and ξN = 3.2 and are also tightly estimated. Lower values of ξH and ξN are associated with lower responsiveness of depreciation to
utilization and, therefore, larger responsiveness of utilization to fluctuations in the marginal revenue product of capital. The low estimated ξH and ξN reflect the sharp decline in utilization in
the bust period in Figure 1. Utilization in the non-traded sector collapses by more than in the
traded sector, consistent with a lower estimated value of ξN than ξH .
Finally, the estimated adjustment cost parameters are mainly tied to the observed movements
in capital, prices, and wages. As we discuss further below, we characterize price and wage rigidities
as having only short-lived effects because under ψp = 0 and ψw = 0 the evolution of quantities at
horizons longer than one to two years is similar to the baseline with estimated values of ψp = 47
and ψw = 38 and because under the estimated values ψp = 47 and ψw = 38 an exchange rate
devaluation leads to short-lived only changes in real variables. This characterization is consistent
with the significant declines in Greek prices and wages observed during the bust period.

Quantitative Results

We begin by demonstrating the ability of the model to account for key macroeconomic time series.
Next, we quantify the importance of each driving force in generating time series that resemble
those observed in the data. Finally, we assess the importance of various model elements for the
performance of the model and present model-generated fiscal multipliers.

5.1

Model Fit

Figure 3 compares time series of production measures generated by the model to their analogs in
the data. The model generates an increase in output y between 1999 and 2007 that mimics closely
the increase observed in the data. Similar to the experience of Greece in the boom period, the
growth of output is mostly accounted for by growing labor and capital inputs and not so much by
changes in TFP. The model is also successful in generating comovement across sectors, with both
traded output yH and non-traded output yN increasing by roughly as much as in the data.

Figure 3: Model vs Data: Production
Figure 3 plots the evolution of macroeconomic variables relative to 1999 in the model and in the data. H denotes
the traded sector and N denotes the non-traded sector. y is output, ` is labor, k̃ is the capital stock, TFP is
total factor productivity, and u is utilization. Quantities are detrended with 2 percent per year and TFP with 0.9
percent.

Turning to the bust period after 2007, the model generates roughly two-thirds of the observed
decline in output. As in the data, the decline in output is accounted for by both a decline in
factors of production and in TFP. The model performs better in the early years of the bust, when
output fell by more than 20 percent. After 2012, there is a divergence between output in the data
which continues to fall (relative to trend) and output in the model which remains depressed at
roughly 20 percent below its 1999 value. This discrepancy concerns mainly the non-traded sector,
in which the model generates a smaller decline in utilization than observed in the data.30
Figure 4 compares expenditures and prices generated by the model to their analogs in the data.
During the first part of the sample, the model generates increases in consumption c, investment
x, exports, and imports that are broadly consistent with the increases in the data.31 Additionally,
the model generates increases in the price of traded goods PH , non-traded goods PN , the consumer
price index Pc , and wages W that quantitatively match the increases observed in the data.
The model generates a decline in expenditures during the bust. However, the decline in consumption is significantly smaller than the decline observed in the data by 2016. Part of the
discrepancy occurs because the consumption decline in the model begins three years prior to the
decline in the data. The model performs better with respect to investment, generating roughly
two-thirds of its decline until the end of the sample. The model generates a larger drop in exports
than observed in the data, but accounts quite well for their lack of recovery after 2012. Additionally, the model generates exactly the drop in imports observed in the data. Regarding prices, the
model generates a significant fraction of the observed devaluation in the price of non-traded goods
and in wages, although the model and data trends diverge somewhat in the last few years.

The Sources of the Greek Boom and Bust

Table 4 documents the sources of the boom (1999-2007) and Table 5 the sources of the bust (20072016). The first two rows of each table report changes in selected variables in the data and the
model. In each other row, we shut off the time evolution of particular exogenous processes and
30

We have detrended quantities in the data with a constant rate of 2 percent per year. Detrending with a smaller
rate would lower the success of the model during the boom and close the discrepancy during the bust. We highlight
that our estimates of price and wage rigidities are very similar when we do not detrend the data. Appendix Figure
C.3 presents model results against the raw data.

set them equal to a constant. A positive entry means that the time evolution of the exogenous
process contributes to an increase of a variable. For each variable, summing up entries across
exogenous processes totals the reported sum in the model row. We summarize the contributions
of the driving forces in five categories (productivity, external, financial, fiscal spending, and taxes).
Beginning with the boom period in Table 4, we note the importance of traded productivity
zH for output and external demand āT for output, consumption, and prices. Financial forces are
significant contributors to the boom of many variables. Among financial driving forces, we note

the importance of declining interest rates i∗ and r∗ and relaxation of the borrowing constraint B̄ r ,
especially in fuelling a consumption boom. Among fiscal driving forces, government spending g
contributes to the production boom and transfers to rule-of-thumb households T r contribute to
the consumption boom. Taxes do not contribute significantly to any variable because they do not
vary much during this period.
Table 5 presents the sources of the Greek bust. The decline in traded productivity zH contributes significantly to the decline in output, but only directly and not through the observed
34

declines in factors of production. Non-traded productivity zN does not contribute significantly
to any macroeconomic variable. The decline in external demand āT is at least as important for
output as the decline in productivity and contributes to the bust both through a decline in factors
of production and through a decline in TFP. Changes in external demand also matter more than
productivity quantitatively in generating declines in prices and wages during the bust.
We find a limited role for financial shocks during the bust period. The exception is the
decline in the borrowing limit of rule-of-thumb households B̄ r which is quantitatively important for
generating a decline in consumption. The leverage ratio of firms θ does not contribute significantly
to the bust because, as seen in Figure 2(e), it rebounds quickly to pre-2007 levels. The probability
of disaster π exerts a significant effect on consumption until 2012 and again in 2015, but these
effects dissipate quickly by 2016 when π reverts back to lower levels.32
We find a significant role for fiscal shocks during the bust. Collectively, fiscal forces generate a
15 percent decline in output, reflecting declines in both factors of production and TFP. Disaggregating fiscal shocks into the various components, we note the importance of government spending
g and labor income taxes τ ` for labor and the importance of capital income taxes τHk and τNk for
capital and TFP. While taxes and transfers T r account for a significant fraction of the decline
in consumption, reduced government spending more than offsets this decline. At the same time,
declines in fiscal spending generate declines in prices and wages, but the increase in capital income
taxes in the non-traded sector substantially mitigates the devaluation of the economy.33

5.3

The Importance of Structural Elements

In this section, we assess the quantitative importance of the model’s mechanisms in accounting
for the Greek boom (1999-2007) and bust (2007-2016). The first two rows in each panel of Table
6 report changes in selected variables in the data and in the baseline model for the boom period
(upper panel) and the bust period (lower panel). Each other row reports changes in the same
variables when we feed the same sequence of shocks but under different parameter values relative
to the baseline model. This exercise also clarifies the identification of the estimated parameters.
32

Appendix Table C.3 documents the contribution of exogenous processes in the first part of the bust period and
shows that π accounts for a 12 percent consumption decline between 2007 and 2012.
33
Farhi, Gopinath, and Itskhoki (2014) analyze the optimal mix of tax instruments that allow a small open
economy to replicate the real effects of a nominal devaluation. We note two prominent deviations of the Greek tax
1−τ `
adjustments relative to their prescriptions. First, the labor wedge induced by taxes, 1+τ
c , increases by roughly
15 percent during the bust period. Second, capital income taxes increased substantially more than labor income
taxes, distorting the equilibrium mix of factors of production.

Variable utilization of factors plays a central role in the model’s ability to account for the
Greek macroeconomic time series. In the absence of variable utilization (ξH = ξN = ∞), the
model would generate larger increases in labor, consumption, and prices during the boom and
smaller declines in output and TFP during the bust. Increasing the responsiveness of utilization
relative to the baseline (ξH = ξN = 2) allows the model to generate a larger decline in output and
TFP in the bust but at the cost of generating a counterfactual increase in prices and a smaller
decline in wages than observed in the data. The tension between accounting for the behavior of
quantities and the behavior of prices during the bust explains why our estimated elasticities of
utilization (ξH = 5.0 and ξN = 3.2) lie between these more extreme values.
Turning to preference parameters and household heterogeneity, Table 6 shows that increasing
the Frisch elasticity of labor supply  to 1 relative to the baseline value of 0.48 allows the model
to generate a larger decline in output during the bust period. However, such a higher value would
counterfactually generate a larger decline in labor and a smaller decline in wages than observed
in the data. Both complementarities between labor and consumption (reflected in a low value of
ρ) and rule-of-thumb behavior (reflected in a significant value of ζ) are important in generating a
decline in consumption during the bust. With the exceptions of consumption and wages during
the bust, the performance of the model is not too sensitive to substantial variations of the trade
elasticity η around our point estimate of 1.65.
The last rows in each panel illustrate the role of adjustment costs. Shutting off price or wage
rigidity completely does not affect significantly the performance of the model in terms of accounting
for the boom and bust relative to the baseline with ψp = 47 and ψw = 38. We explore why the
model favors a low degree of nominal rigidity by increasing the price or wage rigidity to the extreme
values of ψp = 1000 and ψw = 1000. Under these extreme values, the consumption decline during
the bust comes closer to matching the data. However, higher degrees of nominal rigidity introduce
significant deviations of the model from the data in terms of consumption in the boom and, most
importantly, in terms of prices and wages in both the boom and bust. The magnitude of the boom
and bust is not too sensitive to the value of the adjustment costs of profits ψπ . By contrast, the
magnitude of the boom in the model is sensitive to the value of the adjustment cost of capital ψk
because, without the adjustment cost, the model would generate an excessive boom relative to
the data.

Fiscal Multipliers

Table 7 presents fiscal multipliers generated by our estimated model for each instrument f =
{g, ζT r , τ c , τ x , τ ` , τHk , τNk }. Entries denote the cumulative output multiplier at horizon h:
Mfy (h)

+ i∗ )1−t ∆ft

(21)

generated by an initial impulse ν0f in fiscal instrument f and its autoregressive process in equation
(16). Changes in output ∆yt are calculated as the difference between the path of output given
the fiscal impulse and the path of output in the absence of the fiscal impulse. Because output in
steady state equals one, the multipliers with respect to tax rates can be interpreted as the percent
change in output resulting from a one percentage point change in a tax rate. In the table we report
contemporaneous multipliers at horizon h = 1 year, cumulative multipliers at horizon h = 7 years
to benchmark our results to the fiscal adjustment that began in 2010, and multipliers at infinite
horizon h = ∞. We discount future changes at the steady state interest rate of i∗ = 0.07.
The upper panel of Table 7 reports multipliers under various financing systems and horizons.34
The model generates a government spending multiplier of around 0.5 when financed with lump
sum transfers T o . The multiplier with respect to transfers to rule-of-thumb households ranges
from roughly 0.6 upon impact to 0.1 as we increase the horizon. Capital income and investment
tax multipliers are increasing in the horizon, whereas labor income and consumption taxes are
more stable with respect to the horizon. At infinite horizon, tax multipliers range from less than
-0.3 to roughly -0.1. With respect to the financing system, we stress the importance of deficit
financing B g for the government spending multiplier upon impact which rises from 0.5 to 0.9.
To understand the importance of model elements for the multipliers, the second panel reports
multipliers under different parameterizations of the model for the case with T o financing and
horizon of h = 7 years. In the presence of nominal rigidity, the most important parameter for the
spending multiplier is the persistence ρf of the fiscal shocks because it determines the required
increase in taxes and, therefore, the degree of crowding-out of private consumption. Lowering
34

The baseline case considers lump sum transfers to optimizing households T o adjusting to satisfy the government
budget constraint in equation (15). As an alternative we allow lump sum transfers to both types of households, T r
and T o , to adjust by introducing innovations to T r such that the change in T r equals the change in T o in every
period and the budget balances. Finally, we consider deficit finance in which we keep T o fixed to its steady state
value and introduce an innovation to B g with size such that, upon impact, the government budget constraint holds.
For subsequent periods, B g follows its autoregressive process in equation (16) and we solve for innovations to T r
and T o to satisfy the budget constraint.

the persistence from close to 1 in our baseline to 0.3 raises the multiplier to roughly 0.9.35 The
government spending multiplier is more stable with respect to other parameters. Higher nominal
price rigidity, a higher labor supply elasticity, and lower capital adjustment costs are associated
with somewhat higher government spending multipliers. The transfer multiplier also increases
when the persistence of fiscal shocks is lower and nominal price or wage rigidities are stronger.
How do the spending multipliers compare to the existing literature? On the theoretical side,
our model contains elements — nominal stickiness, liquidity-constrained agents, and consumptionlabor complementarity — identified by earlier literature (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2014; Farhi and
Werning, 2016; House, Proebsting, and Tesar, 2017) as contributing to larger government spending
multipliers for countries such as Greece that belong to a currency union. Despite this, our model
generates smaller multipliers than in these papers for two reasons. First, this literature considers
more transient changes in spending than observed in Greece.36 Second, some of the theoretical
literature considers complete asset markets whereas we model Greece operating within incomplete
international asset markets. In response to government spending shocks, complete asset markets
trigger a transfer of wealth that offsets the negative wealth effect on consumption and the rise
in local prices. With incomplete asset markets, the multiplier in Nakamura and Steinsson (2014)
falls from 1.4 to 0.8 and in House, Proebsting, and Tesar (2017) from 2.0 to 1.5.
On the empirical side, the closest analogs are estimates of government spending multipliers in
subnational regions belonging to a currency union (such as U.S. states) or in countries with fixed
exchange rates. Chodorow-Reich (2019) reviews empirical estimates of subnational multipliers
and emphasizes that, because subnational spending is financed by the central government, these
estimates should be compared to model-generated multipliers for transitory spending shocks for
which the associated increase in tax burden is small. The impact multiplier of 1.3 for more
transitory spending shocks in our model falls in the middle of the range of estimates he reviews.
Using the identification scheme pioneered by Blanchard and Perotti (2002), Ilzetzki, Mendoza,
and Vegh (2013) report multipliers above 1 for countries with fixed exchange rates, but smaller or
35
The contemporaneous multiplier (h = 1) rises to roughly 1.3. We report these results in Appendix Table C.4.
Additionally, in Appendix Tables C.5 and C.6 we report results for deficit financed multipliers at various horizons.
36
In their quantitative evaluation, Farhi and Werning (2016) consider spending which lasts 1.25 years. Nakamura
and Steinsson (2014) and House, Proebsting, and Tesar (2017) both consider spending with annual persistence
of 0.75. The European Central Bank (2015) reports multipliers for 15 models maintained by central banks in
the European System. The closest experiment to our own is the short-run impact of a permanent reduction in
government purchases with no contemporaneous change in taxes. These multipliers range from 0.25 to 0.97, with the
Bank of Greece model at 0.87, close to the value of 0.90 shown in Table 7 for the impact effect of a deficit-financed,
persistent change in spending.

40

even negative multipliers for countries with high debt burdens such as Greece.37
The tax multipliers in Table 7 tend to decline in magnitude as the degree of price rigidity
increases because output becomes less sensitive to supply-side distortions and adjusts to satisfy
demand. Higher nominal wage rigidity also tends to lower the tax multipliers, with the exception
of labor income taxes. The labor tax multiplier increases in magnitude the more responsive labor
supply is, which in terms of our parameters corresponds to a higher nominal wage rigidity, a
higher Frisch labor supply elasticity, and a higher complementarity between consumption and
labor. Capital income tax multipliers are sensitive to variable utilization. To understand this
result, we note that the first-order conditions for utilization in each sector i = {H, N } imply

 ξ1
(1−τ k )P̃ y
ui = ξ̄i (1+τix )PiT iki i . Capital taxes lower utilization and exert a negative impact on output even
before capital adjusts. Finally, the model generates larger effects of capital income tax rates
on output when tax rates are more persistent because persistent changes in taxes affect capital
accumulation more.
The closest related evidence for tax multipliers comes from the study of fiscal consolidations by
Alesina, Favero, and Giavazzi (2019). Using a panel of countries which excludes Greece, they find
that a change in tax rates resulting in a 1 percent increase in revenue to GDP over 4 years causes
GDP to fall by 2 percent. They do not distinguish among different types of taxes. Comparing
their estimated multiplier to ours requires converting the tax rate multipliers shown in Table 7 into
revenue multipliers, which we report later in Table 9. This yields revenue multipliers of roughly
-0.5 for consumption, -1 for labor, and -2 for investment and capital taxes at a 7-year horizon.38

Policy Experiments

Nominal devaluation. The first policy experiment is an exchange rate devaluation that would
have accompanied a hypothetical Greek exit from the euro. Specifically, we set the exchange rate
37
House, Proebsting, and Tesar (2017) arrive at somewhat larger multipliers in Europe for the post-2010 period
by comparing forecast errors of government spending and output. However, this approach does not by itself isolate
a government spending multiplier, since other variables could affect the forecast errors of both spending and output.
Blanchard and Leigh (2013) find that forecasters underestimated fiscal multipliers during this period but do not
distinguish between government spending and tax multipliers.
38
Other evidence comes from the Mertens and Ravn (2013) implementation of the Romer and Romer (2010)
discretionary tax changes for the United States. The short-run semi-elasticities of output to personal income taxes
(roughly -1.5) and corporate income taxes (roughly -0.5) in Mertens and Ravn (2013) are significantly higher than
ours (roughly -0.4 and 0 respectively). The revenue-based multipliers they report for personal income taxes (roughly
-2.5) are higher than our labor income tax multiplier (roughly -1). Their revenue-based multipliers for capital taxes
are similar to ours because in Table 9 we find no significant revenue effects from changing capital income taxes.

Figure 5 plots the time series of selected variables in our baseline model and under a counterfactual where the
nominal exchange rate depreciates by 10 percent in 2010. The red dashed line plots a counterfactual where debt is
denominated in euro, and the blue dashed line a counterfactual where debt is denominated in local currency.

Et to 1 for all years until 2009 and in 2010 introduce an unexpected and permanent increase
in Et to 1.1. The depreciation raises the domestic price of foreign traded goods PF = EPF∗ by
10 percent.39 Figure 5 presents the evolution of output y and the terms of trade PF /PH in the
baseline economy and in the counterfactual economy in which a devaluation happens in 2010.
In the dashed-dotted red line, debt is denominated in euros and, as a result, the devaluation
increases the local currency price of debt liabilities for households, firms, and the government.
In the dashed blue line, debt is denominated in local currency and, as a result, the devaluation
results in a transfer of resources from foreigners to Greece. In all cases, the devaluation stimulates
output in the first couple of periods through a switch of expenditures toward cheaper domestically
produced goods. However, given the low estimated degree of price and wage rigidity, a nominal
devaluation would have only short-lived effects and would not have helped the Greek economy
escape the depression after 2012.
Fiscal adjustment mix. The effects of fiscal innovations on macroeconomic outcomes in
Table 5 maintain the assumption that lump sum transfers to optimizing households T o adjust to
satisfy the government budget constraint. The fiscal multipliers in Table 7 additionally consider
adjustments in government debt B g . Because changes in debt or direct transfers may not be
39
We consider only the devaluation component of an exit and not any costs associated with transitioning to a
new currency. Because the depreciation is unexpected and permanent, the uncovered interest parity implies an
equalization of the domestic interest rate i to the foreign interest rate i∗ in all periods.

politically feasible, we now assess the macroeconomic effects of more policy relevant scenarios
under which alternative compositions of policy instruments {g, ζT r , τ c , τ x , τ ` , τHk , τNk } are used to
achieve fiscal consolidation.
Table 8 presents results from alternative fiscal consolidation policies. The first column of the
table reports a set of fiscal instruments for which we set all innovations to zero beginning in 2010.
The second column of the table reports which fiscal instruments adjust to balance the government
budget constraint. For example, in the first row we set all tax innovations to zero starting in 2010
and introduce innovations to government spending g and transfers to rule-of-thumb households
T r such that the government budget constraint is satisfied. In these experiments, households and
firms perceive the law of motion of fiscal instruments to still be governed by the autoregressive
process in equation (16). As a result, all changes we introduce to fiscal instruments are unexpected,
which we view as a desirable property of our exercise since the Greek fiscal consolidation process
went through various unexpected changes during the three adjustment programs.
We find significant macroeconomic effects of tilting the Greek fiscal adjustment process away
from tax increases toward spending cuts. In the first rows of each panel of Table 8, this alternative
fiscal mix would increase output y by 2.5 percent in 2016 relative to the observed fiscal adjustment
43

and by 2.8 percent in 2025 relative to the evolution of the economy predicted by our model but
without changes in the composition of the adjustment.40 The medium-term gains in output are
mostly accounted for by an increase in TFP, whereas the longer-term gains accrue from capital
accumulation. We also find significant gains in real wages W/Pc and private consumption c. The
second row of the table shows that the production gains are smaller and the consumption gains
are larger if the removal of tax increases is offset by only government spending g cuts. Similarly,
the third row demonstrates that removing the decline in T r and introducing even larger declines
in g results in modest losses in production and gains in private consumption.41
The other rows of Table 8 present experiments that change the fiscal consolidation process
on the tax side only. Removing the increases in capital taxes and substituting them with even
larger increases in labor income taxes results in a modest increase in output by 2016, reflecting
offsetting effects from an increase in TFP and a decline in labor. However, by 2025 such a policy
leads to significant capital accumulation and is associated with output gains of 4.5 percent and
consumption gains of 2.5 percent. The final row shows significant gains by tilting the consolidation
away from all taxes other than consumption. By 2025 such a policy would generate output gains
of 5.7 percent, accounted for by capital accumulation and an increase in TFP.42
To understand the relative effectiveness of the various options, Table 9 presents the output
and revenue effects of each fiscal instrument. The output effects at 1-year, 7-year, and infinite
horizon are given by the multipliers Mfy (h) in equation (21), under the assumption that lumpsum transfers T o adjust to balance the budget. The revenue effects correspond to the change in
lump-sum transfers required to balance the government budget constraint after a response ν0f in
instrument f = {g, ζT r , τ c , τ x , τ ` , τHk , τNk } following the autoregressive process in equation (16):

Dividing Mfy (h) by Mfr (h) yields the revenue-based multiplier for instrument f at horizon h. For
example, at a 7-year horizon a cumulative one percentage point decrease in τ ` would necessitate
40
For periods after 2016, we set innovations to all exogenous processes in vector zt to zero. The endogenous
variables (including T o ) evolve according to their policy functions given the state vector and zt evolves according
to its autoregressive process in equation (16).
41
We acknowledge that private consumption c is an imperfect proxy of welfare if government spending g is valued
by households. For the policy experiments below in which we change only the tax side of the adjustment, g remains
constant and changes in c are more relevant for welfare.
42
Papageorgiou (2012) uses data up to 2008 and highlights that increasing consumption and lowering labor
income taxes stimulates the economy. Our emphasis on capital income taxes is justified by their significant increase
during the bust period.

additional lump-sum taxes of 0.4 units. A unit increase of revenues induced by higher τ ` would
then lower output by −0.35/0.4 ≈ −0.9 units.
Table 9 highlights significant differences across fiscal instruments in their ability to raise revenues. A one percentage point increase in consumption or labor income taxes increases revenues by
significantly more than a one percentage point increase in capital income taxes, with the difference
magnified at longer horizons. In fact, the economy is close to the peak of the Laffer curve with
respect to capital tax rates at longer horizons. This result explains why shifting the burden of
adjustment away from capital taxes toward either consumption or labor taxes produces significant
output and consumption gains by 2025 — the required increase in other taxes is relatively small.43
The production and consumption gains from adjusting through consumption taxes also reflect
the equivalence between an anticipated declining path of consumption taxes and a decrease in
capital income taxes. In the counterfactual, innovations in consumption tax rates between 2010
and 2016 are unexpected, while the post-2016 decline follows the autoregressive process (16) and
is fully anticipated by households. Thus, this policy mimics an initial capital levy followed by
declining capital income taxes.

utilization to 0.04 and 0.16 without variable utilization. Our results corroborate the analysis of Trabandt and Uhlig
(2011) who demonstrate that the Greek revenue maximizing capital tax rate is roughly 40 percent, implying small
revenue losses from cutting capital taxes.

argue that reducing fiscal spending in the boom would have allowed both Greece and other periphery euro countries to adjust by less in the bust. Table 10 repeats the spirit of their exercise
within our model economy. Each row represents an experiment in which we shut off innovations in
transfers to rule-of-thumb households T r or government spending g in the entire sample. Between
1999 and 2009, government debt B g adjusts to make the flow government budget constraint hold.
Starting in 2010, we solve for the path of capital taxes τ k or labor taxes τ ` such that the flow
government budget constraint holds and government debt B g grows linearly back to its observed
level in 2016. Effectively, our exercise calculates the macroeconomic outcomes that Greece could
have accomplished if in 2010 it had entered with a lower stock of debt and used the freed-up
resources to reduce distortionary taxes during the depression.
As Table 10 documents, removing the spending during the boom years would lower output in
2007 by roughly 3 percent, with roughly two-thirds of this decline accounted for by the decline
in government spending. If the freed-up resources from a lower debt level in 2010 were used to
finance a reduction in capital taxes, output would have been 15 percent higher by 2016. We note
a significant difference between shutting off the growth of transfers T r , which account for roughly
three-quarters of the 15 percent increase, and government spending g. This difference occurs
partly because T r grows by more than g in euros during the boom and partly because the transfer
multiplier is lower than the government spending multiplier. As the table reveals, using the freedup resources to lower labor income taxes would have produced significantly smaller output gains.
The difference between labor and capital taxes is consistent with our findings in Table 9 showing
that the economy is closer to the peak of the Laffer curve with respect to capital income taxes.

Conclusion

We develop and estimate a rich macroeconomic model of the Greek economy with the goal of understanding the boom and bust experienced over the past two decades. Our exercise is disciplined
by detailed analysis of macroeconomic patterns and by feeding in directly time series of shocks as
measured in the data. Lower external demand for traded goods and contractionary fiscal policies
account for the largest fraction of the Greek depression. Financial forces account for some of
the boom but have a limited part in accounting for the persistence of the depression. In terms
of mechanisms, we attribute an important role to lower utilization of factors in amplifying the
depression. On the other hand, the observed adjustment of prices and wages throughout the cycle
suggest a limited role for nominal rigidities in terms of accounting for the significant boom and
the sustained depression of the Greek economy. While these conclusions challenge some prevailing narratives of the Greek and broader southern euro experience, they follow from equilibrium
analysis of simple patterns in the macroeconomic data.
We use the model to evaluate alternative policies that Greece might have pursued. A nominal
devaluation raises output on impact, but, given the low estimated degree of nominal price and
wage rigidity, would have only short-lived stabilizing effects. In contrast, shifting the burden of
adjustment away from taxes toward spending or from capital income taxes toward other taxes
would generate significant and persistent production and consumption gains. Finally, we quantify
substantial benefits if Greece had avoided the debt-financed rise of household transfers during the
boom and used the additional fiscal space to reduce capital taxes during the bust.

Model Appendix

In Appendix A.1 we list the equilibrium conditions of the model and in Appendix A.2 we describe
how we incorporate rare disasters into the model.

A.1

Equilibrium Conditions

We present the equilibrium conditions for the baseline model in which the exchange rate is Et = 1
and households and firms expect Et to always be constant. For the exchange rate devaluation
experiment we assume that Et rises unexpectedly and permanently. Because the depreciation is
unexpected and permanent, the uncovered interest parity implies an equalization of the domestic
interest rate i to the foreign interest rate i∗ in all periods.

Rare Disasters

In this appendix we discuss how we incorporate rare disasters into the model. As described in the
main text, a time-varying probability of a rare disaster πt enters multiplicatively with the discount
factor in the intertemporal optimality conditions of the model. This simplifies significantly the
solution and estimation of the model with time-varying disasters because it allows us to use
standard perturbation techniques. This result, adapted from Gourio (2012), is a consequence
of the assumptions that all endogenous and exogenous state variables scale with the cumulative
realization of disasters over time. Owing to this assumption, we can reformulate the economy with
disaster risk into a transformed economy in which the probability of disaster only enters into the
intertemporal optimality conditions.
We denote by n̂ some variable in the primitive formulation of the economy and by n the same
variable in the transformed economy. The disaster process is:

 0 with probability 1 − π ,
t
ϕ̂t+1 =
 ϕ with probability π ,

and the cumulative effect of disasters is:
log Φ̂t = log Φ̂t−1 − ϕ̂t .
The exogenous state variables affected by disasters are given by:
log ẑH,t = log zH,t + (1 − αH ) log Φ̂t ,
log ẑN,t = log zN,t + (1 − αN ) log Φ̂t ,
log ĝt = log gt + log Φ̂t ,

Data Appendix

Appendix B.1 presents evidence on the decline in value added and employment by firm size and
decomposes the decline in aggregate labor productivity. Appendix B.2 details the growth accounting methodology and the measurement of utilization. Appendix B.3 presents alternative measures
of wages. Appendix B.5 presents alternative measures of value-added exports and external demand and decomposes the change in exports during the bust by industry. Appendix B.6 provides
additional details on the estimation of disaster probabilities using options data. Appendix B.7
provides additional details on the measurement of effective tax rates. Appendix B.8 describes the
estimation of the trade elasticity.

B.1

Value Added, Employment, and Productivity by Size Class

In this appendix we use data between 2009 and 2014 from the Structural Business Statistics to
analyze the declines in value added, employment, and labor productivity for firms of different size
classes. The Structural Business Statistics provide value added and employment aggregates for
firms belonging to different employment sizes, ranging from firms with 1-9 employees to firms with
more than 250 employees. The data are available at the industry level for up to four digits of
disaggregation.
Figure B.1 presents value added and employment trends by firm size class. The decline in
value added and employment is observed throughout the size distribution.
Figure B.2 decomposes the decline in labor productivity into a within-firm size component and
a between-firm size component. Each industry is represented by a dot in the figure. For almost
all industries, the decline in labor productivity is accounted for by declines in labor productivity
within firms belonging to a particular size class rather than by a reallocation of economic activity
across firms with different size classes and different levels of productivity.

B.2.1

Total Factor Productivity

We measure TFP as the Solow residual. Data on value-added and total hours worked come directly
from Eurostat. We construct capital services by aggregating four types of capital (structures,
machinery and equipment, cultivated biological resources, and intellectual property assets) using
user cost weights based on actual depreciation and a required 5 percent net return.2 Capital typeby-industry data come from the Eurostat non-financial asset accounts. Under the assumptions
of competitive output markets and constant-returns-to-scale production, we calculate the hours
elasticity by multiplying total labor compensation by the ratio of total to employee hours in each
industry and obtain the capital elasticity as a residual.3
B.2.2

Utilization Measurement

Our main measures of utilization come from the Joint Harmonised European Union Industry
Survey and the Joint Harmonised European Union Services Survey. Both surveys are administered
quarterly by the European Commission and are representative of firms in their respective sectors.
Since 1985, The Industry Survey has asked the question (INDU13QPS):
At what capacity is your company currently operating (as a percentage of full capacity)?
We average the quarterly responses to obtain annual utilization for the manufacturing sector. In
2011 the Services Survey added the question (SERV8QPS):
If the demand expanded, could you increase your volume of activity with your present
resources? If so, by how much?”
For 2011 forward, we use the annual average of responses to this question to obtain utilization
for the services sector. We extend the measure of utilization in the services sector further back in
time using the fraction of respondents reporting “None” to the question (SERV7F1S):
What main factors are currently limiting your business?
2

We have experimented with thresholds for the required return up to 20 percent and an internal return based
on capital income payments with little change in the results.
3
As is well known, with non-competitive output markets the output elasticities equate to factor cost shares
rather than factor revenue shares. It follows immediately that a time-invariant markup scales TFP growth by
the markup. Time-varying markups pose additional difficulties which we do not pursue since we lack independent
evidence on this margin.

Figure B.3: Aggregate TFP and Alternative Measures of Utilization
Specifically, a regression of the four quarter change to question SERV8QPS, ∆4 SERV8QPS, on
the four quarter change in this fraction, ∆4 SERV7F1S, yields:
∆4 SERV8QPS = −1.4 + 0.47∆4 SERV7F1, N = 19.
The Newey-West standard error with bandwidth of 4 on the coefficient for ∆4 SERV7F1 is 0.09 and
the R2 of the regression is 0.62, making the question a plausible proxy for the utilization question
asked starting in 2011. We use the fitted values from this regression to impute SERV8QPS for
quarters prior to 2011 and then take annual averages and cap the resulting measure at 100. Finally,
as no survey measures exist covering agriculture or mining and quarrying, we assume no utilization
margin exists in these industries.
We construct an alternative measure of utilization by building on the framework of Basu (1996).
Suppressing superscripts for simplicity, this approach starts by specializing the production function
for gross output to a CES aggregate of value-added V (.) and materials m:
i σ
h 1
1
σ−1
σ−1 σ−1
σ
σ
σ
+ ξm m σ
,
z ξv V (uk k, u` `)
where uk and u` denote utilization of capital k and labor `, ξv and ξm are distribution parameters,
and σ is the elasticity of substitution between value added and materials. Letting Rv and Rm be
the shadow costs of a unit of value-added and materials, cost minimization implies:
d log u ≡ α` d log u` +αk d log uk = d log m−(α` d log ` + αk d log k)−σ (d log Rv − d log Rm ) . (B.1)
Equation (B.1) says that when the growth of materials exceeds the weighted average growth
of labor and capital, either the cost of materials must have risen by less than the cost of value11

Notes: The solid black line reports the ratio of total national accounts employee compensation to total employee

The dashed green line shows the labor cost index series for the total economy. The green triangles and diamonds

added or unobserved utilization of capital and labor must have risen. When production is Leontief
between value-added and materials (σ = 0), any excess growth of materials over labor and capital
must reflect unobserved utilization. We implement equation (B.1) in the Leontief case. Figure B.3
plots aggregate TFP along with the two measures of utilization. As the figure shows, the survey
measure of utilization displays a similar drop between 2007 and 2011 with the drop observed in
the Basu (1996) measure of utilization.

B.3

Alternative Measures of Wages

Appendix B.3 reports alternative wage series. The wage data in this figure have not been detrended. The solid black line reports the measure used in the main analysis, equal to the ratio
of total employee compensation to total employee hours worked. The dashed blue lines show the
same wage concept separately for non-traded and traded industries. The dashed green line shows
the labor cost index series for the total economy. The green triangles and diamonds show the labor
cost indexes separately for public sector and private sector employees, respectively. The orange X
and yellow o report public and private sector wages from the quadrennial Structure of Earnings

Survey. Finally, for comparison the dotted pink line shows the national accounts wage measure
for the total euro area.
We next examine changes in hourly wages (not detrended) during the bust for different types of
workers. These changes come from the Structure of Earnings Survey, a large sample enterprise-level
survey conducted every four years by Eurostat. The sampling frame includes all establishments
with at least 10 employees, excluding public administration. Table B.1 reports hourly wage changes
between 2010 and 2014, by worker age, skill, and position in the within age-skill wage distribution.
Strikingly, nominal wage declines occur across age groups, skill categories, and in all parts of the
wage distribution. These patterns militate against interpretations of the aggregate data focused
only on compositional effects or changes specific to certain parts of the wage distribution that
arise, for example, from changes in the statutory minimum wage.

B.4

Downward Wage Rigidity Measures

In this appendix we repeat the analysis of Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016) for the inference of
downward nominal wage rigidity in our data. Before proceeding we make two comments. First,
Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016) infer the extent of downward wage rigidity using data between
2008 and 2011 and stopped their analysis in 2011 because later data were not available at the time
they were conducting their analysis. Second, our inference of wage rigidity does not come from
a particular time period as we estimate the model with Bayesian Maximum Likelihood using the
time series of nominal wages between 1999 and 2016. Despite these differences, we document in
this appendix that the inference of downward nominal wage rigidity can be sensitive to the timing
of wage declines.
Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016) impose a constraint of the form Wt ≥ γWt−1 on the evolution of wages. Using quarterly data between 2008(1) and 2011(2), for Greece they estimate
quarterly
γ2011(2)/2008(1)
= 0.998. To compare their to our estimates that come at annual frequency, we

define the following two estimates of the extent of downward nominal wage rigidity:

In Table B.2 we calculate values of γ for different three year periods. We begin by noticing that,
similarly to the experience of many other countries, the employment decline in Greece lagged the
GDP decline by roughly one year. Our quarterly estimate of γ using data between 2008 and 2011

is 0.994. Part of the difference between our estimate of 0.994 and the estimate 0.998 in SchmittGrohé and Uribe (2016) comes from the different detrending. Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016)
detrend wages with 2.4 percent, appealing to the fact that growth in Southern European countries
between 1990 and 2011 averaged 1.2 percent per year and inflation in Germany during 2008 and
2011 averaged 1.2 percent per year. We detrend wages with 3 percent, appealing to the fact that
growth in Greece between 1970 and 1998 averaged roughly 2 percent and euro inflation between
1999 and 2016 averaged roughly 1 percent. The remaining difference in our estimates come from
the fact that we use annual data (which averages across quarters) whereas Schmitt-Grohé and
Uribe (2016) use data between 2008(1) and 2011(2).
Moving across rows in Table B.2 illustrates the sensitivity of the estimated γ to the three year
window used in the estimation. During the particular Greek experience, the estimated γ falls when
latter data is used during the recession. For example, if one used 2009 to 2012, which represents
the window with the maximal GDP and employment decline, the quarterly γ is 0.989 and the
annual γ is 0.957.

To gain further insight into the decline in āT during the bust, Table B.3 reports the 2007 to
2014 change in gross exports and value-added exports by industry using the WIOD data, expressed
as a percent of 2007 GDP. Four features merit mention. First, total gross exports barely grow
despite the real exchange rate depreciation. Second, value-added exports actually fall, highlighting
the importance of separating gross from value-added exports. Third, the difference between gross
and value-added exports mostly comes from the refined petroleum industry, reflecting Greece’s
status as an importer of crude and exporter of refined petroleum. Fourth, the fall in shipping
(formally, water transport) more than accounts for the decline in value-added exports.

are: (i) a representative agent with Epstein-Zin preferences; (ii) a downward jump component in
the process for output; and (iii) a power law distribution of output loss conditional on a downward
jump occurring.
Let Ωi,t denote the price, expressed as a ratio to the date t stock price, of put option i at date
t with strike Si and remaining maturity Ti,t in days. Let “moneyness” Mi,t denote the ratio of Si
to the date t stock price. Equation (25) of Barro and Liao (2016) prices a put option with short
enough maturity Ti,t and low enough moneyness Mi,t such that drift and diffusion components of
the process for output growth have negligible effect on the option’s price:

Ωi,t =

(α − σ) (1 + α − σ)

(B.3)

where α is the Pareto coefficient for loss conditional on a disaster occurring, L0 is the minimum
disaster size, σ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion, and πt is the daily disaster probability.
Thus, the model predicts a unit elasticity of the option price with respect to time-to-maturity
and an elasticity with respect to moneyness which is a function of the Pareto coefficient and risk
aversion.
Our data contain the universe of put options traded on the Athens Stock Exchange between
2001 and 2017.4 Starting from the universe of transactions (53,121 observations), we keep only

options on the FTSE/Athex Large Cap Index (renamed from FTSE/ATHEX 20 on December 3,
2012, 49,154 observations) and further follow Barro and Liao (2016) in restricting the estimation
sample to options with maturity remaining of less than six months and moneyness less than 0.9
(4,025 observations). The estimation is robust to restricting maturity remaining to less than 60
or 30 days and to restricting to options at least 15 percent out of the money.
We take logs of equation (B.3) and estimate using OLS the log-linear equation:
ln Ωi,t = bT ln Ti,t + bM ln Mi,t + dtm + errori,t ,

(B.4)

where bT and bM are coefficients to be estimated and dtm is a month fixed effect.5 The model fits
the data well. We estimate b̂T = 1.16, b̂M = 5.82, and obtain an R2 = 0.83 and a “within” R2
of 0.71. The estimate of b̂T is close to the theory-predicted value of one and our recovered time
series of πt changes little if we impose bT = 1 in the estimation. The estimate of b̂M = 5.82 is
nearly identical to the estimate reported in Barro and Liao (2016) of 5.83 pooling across the nine
countries in their data (none of which is Greece).
The exponentiated fixed effect exp(dtm ) pins down changes over time but not the level of
the disaster probability. To obtain the level requires parameterizing the term in brackets in
equation (B.3). We follow Barro and Liao (2016) and assume a minimum size of disaster L0 of
10 percent and a coefficient of risk aversion σ = 3. Matching coefficients in equation (B.3) and
equation (B.4), we obtain α = b̂M + σ − 1 = 7.82. Given this estimate of α, we then recover the
bracketed term in equation (B.3) and back out monthly averages of daily disaster probability as
h
i
αLα
0
πt = exp(dtm )/ (α−σ)(1+α−σ)
. We annualize these daily disaster probabilities and average across
months in a year to arrive at the disaster probability series used in our analyses. Figure B.6
reports the monthly probabilities along with markers of important political and economic events.
Finally, given the minimum size of disaster L0 and our estimate of α, we recover a mean decline
in output conditional on a disaster occurring equal 21 percent.

Measurement of Tax Rates

Greece levies taxes on transactions, individuals, corporations, and property. We allocate all tax
receipts and actual social contributions into taxes on consumption, investment, labor, and capital.
The two largest revenue categories are taxes on production and imports (code D.2) that account

With more data, we could estimate a date fixed effect dt rather than a month fixed effect dtm . The month
fixed effect constrains the date fixed effects to be the same for every day in a month.

for roughly 60 percent of tax receipts and current taxes on income and wealth (D.5) that account
for roughly 40 percent of tax receipts. Taxes on production and imports less subsidies are allocated
to consumption and investment, with the exception of property taxes paid by enterprises (D.29)
which are allocated to capital income. From taxes on production and imports net of property
taxes, we allocate to consumption the taxes that unambiguously fall into consumption such as
excise duties, taxes on entertainment, lotteries, and gambling, taxes on insurance premiums, and
other taxes on specific services. We then allocate the residual to consumption taxes and investment
taxes in proportion to their expenditure shares and calculate the tax rates as:
τc =

consumption taxes
,
consumption − consumption taxes

τx =

investment taxes
.
investment − investment taxes

(B.5)

The denominators subtract taxes from spending because in national accounts spending is at market
prices and includes taxes.
Current taxes on individual’s income fall on both labor and capital and current taxes on the
income of corporations fall on capital. We measure the labor income tax rate τ ` as the sum of
the tax rate on social security contributions τ SS and the tax rate on labor income net of social
security contributions τ NL , where:
τ

(B.6)

Labor income in the denominators equals compensation of employees, which includes social security
contributions, adjusted for the income of the self-employed that we allocate proportionally between
19

labor and capital. For τ SS , we use an average tax rate because contribution rates are generally
flat within each occupation up to a cap that, according to the Statistics of Income (SOI), affects
less than two percent of tax payers.
The tax rate τ NL equals the fraction of labor income not subject to social security contributions
taxed at the individual income tax rate τ y , where:
τy =

2.08 × (taxes on individual income − taxes on dividends and interest)
.
GDP − production, imports taxes, contributions, depreciation, dividends, interest

(B.7)

In Greece taxes are levied on individual income which consists of unambiguous labor income (such
as income from salaried workers), unambiguous capital income (such as dividends, interest, and
rentals), and ambiguous income (such as income from self-employment, agriculture, and liberal
professions). The denominator of equation (B.7) denotes taxable income which, in addition to
taxes on production and imports, contributions, and depreciation, excludes dividends and interest
because for those types of capital income we have independent information on their taxes and
allocate them directly to capital taxes. The factor 2.08 represents our estimate of the gap between
the average marginal tax rate and the average average tax rate.6
We measure capital tax rates τHk and τNk as capital tax payments divided by taxable capital
income generated in each sector. There are six types of capital tax payments. Property taxes paid
by households are allocated to the non-traded sector. Property taxes paid by corporations are
allocated to each sector in proportion to its share of non-residential structures used in production.
The other four categories, taxes on dividends and interest, income and capital gains taxes paid by
corporations, taxes on capital income paid by households, and other capital taxes, are allocated to
each sector in proportion to its share of capital income net of depreciation. Dividend and interest
taxes are calculated as the product of their respective time-varying statutory tax rates with the
size of dividends and interests from the national accounts. Income and capital gains taxes paid
by corporations come directly from national accounts (in code D.51). Capital income taxes paid
by individuals equals the product of the individual income tax rate τ y in equation (B.7) with the
share of net income accruing to capital. Other capital taxes (code D.91) include inheritance taxes,
death duties, taxes on gifts, and capital levies. Finally, taxable capital income equals the capital
share of GDP less net taxes on products and imports less depreciation.
In Figure B.7 we document the time series of statutory measures of taxes.
6

To estimate this ratio, we use binned up data from the SOI in Greece between 2006 and 2011. This ratio is
relatively stable over time. The SOI data has not been publicly disclosed after 2011.

Estimation of the Trade Elasticity of Substitution

Aggregating equation (13) across retailers and using the corresponding expression for the demand
for the foreign traded good, we obtain an expression relating relative expenditure on domestic and
foreign traded goods and the relative prices of these bundles:
ln(PH,t aH,t /PF,t aF,t ) = ln (γ/ (1 − γ)) + (1 − η) ln(PH,t /PF,t ),

(B.8)

where aH,t and aF,t denote Greek expenditure on the domestic and foreign traded goods, respectively. First differencing equation (B.8) and allowing for a normalizing constant and measurement
error in relative absorption yields the estimating equation:
∆ ln(PH,t aH,t /PF,t aF,t ) = b0 + b1 ∆ ln(PH,t /PF,t ) + et ,

(B.9)

where η = 1 − b1 . The identifying assumption is that preferences for Greek versus foreign goods,
γ in our notation, are stable over time and hence do not appear in the linearized equation (B.9).
We estimate equation (B.9) using Eurostat data and identifying F with the euro area. Since
our model abstracts from intermediate inputs in production, the price indexes and quantities in
equation (B.9) correspond to a value-added concept. Value-added price indexes for the Greek (H)
and euro area (F ) traded goods sector come directly from the national accounts. However, national
accounts do not report either value-added exports or imports. We extend the procedure in Johnson
and Noguera (2012) and apply it to the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) described to
21

recover Greek value-added exports to and imports from the euro area.7 Estimating equation (B.9)
over the period 2000-14, the maximum sample for which we have data from the WIOD, yields
η = 1.65 with standard error equal to 0.25.
We now describe the Johnson and Noguera (2012) procedure for obtaining value-added exports
to and imports from the euro area. The key equation is the (nominal) market-clearing condition:
Q=

X

(I − M)−1 cj ,

(B.10)

j

where Q is an N S × 1 vector of nominal gross output in each industry s ∈ S and country j ∈ N ,
cj is an N S × 1 vector of final demand in country j of output from each country-sector, M is a
global input-output matrix with generic entry given by the share of intermediate goods produced
in sector s in country j used in sector s0 of country i as a share of output of sector s0 in country i,
and we have dropped time subscripts for simplicity since the relationship in equation (B.10) holds
statically. Under the assumption that the value-added content of an industry does not depend
on whether the output is used domestically or exported, one can pre-multiply both sides by a
diagonal matrix R of value-added shares of gross output in each country-sector to obtain:
Py = R

X

(I − M)−1 cj ,

(B.11)

j

where Py is the vector of nominal value-added. Total value-added exports from Greece are then:
X

PH a∗H = ι0Greece R

(I − M)−1 cj ,

(B.12)

j6=Greece

where ιj is an N S × 1 selection vector with a value of one in the rows corresponding to the traded
sectors in country j and zeros elsewhere.8 Greek value-added absorption of Greek traded goods
is:
PH aH = PH yH − PH a∗H .

(B.13)

Similarly, we obtain Greek value-added imports from the euro area as:
P F aF =

X

ι0j R (I − M)−1 cGreece .

(B.14)

j∈euro area

For a description of the WIOD, see Timmer, M. P., Dietzenbacher, E., Los, B., Stehrer, R. and de Vries,
G. J. (2015), “An Illustrated User Guide to the World InputOutput Database: the Case of Global Automotive
Production”, Review of International Economics 23: 575605.
8
In practice, we sum over the sectors which we include in the traded sector aggregate, even though other sectors
may have small but positive value-added exports.

22

We make five remarks on the estimation of η. First, most Greek trade occurs with partners
outside of the euro area. This fact does not invalidate the above procedure, because equation (B.8)
follows directly from a first order condition for the relative expenditure between any two bundles
of goods available to Greeks. Second, our model assumes the same elasticity governs both imports
and exports. In that case, one can also estimate η using relative absorption of Greek and euro area
products by euro area residents. Using the WIOD data, we obtain an almost identical coefficient
of 1.64 for this specification (standard error 0.80). Third, two recent papers have raised criticisms
of regressions designed to uncover the Armington elasticity. Imbs and Mejean (2015) argue that
elasticity estimates based on aggregate data may understate the true elasticity because most aggregate variation comes from sectors with volatile prices which may also have low elasticities.9 In
our data, however, the aggregate elasticity exceeds the weighted mean sectoral elasticity, which is
almost exactly unity. Feenstra, Luck, Obstfeld, and Russ (2018) argue the relevant elasticity in
most models is that between domestic goods and imports but many papers instead estimate an
elasticity across exports from different countries.10 Equation (B.9) directly estimates the appropriate elasticity as advocated by Feenstra, Luck, Obstfeld, and Russ (2018). Fourth, we prefer the
first-differenced specification (B.9) because any changes to preferences likely accumulate over time,
making the levels specification (B.8) more vulnerable to mis-specification. Nonetheless, estimating
the equation in levels implies a slightly lower estimate of η of 1.25 (standard error 0.15). Fifth,
the WIOD does not measure local purchases by non-residents and hence the WIOD VAX measure
excludes tourism exports. Effectively, we impute the same elasticity to the tourism sector as we
obtain for other traded sectors.
We obtain γ as the sample average ratio of domestic absorption of domestic traded to domestic
absorption of all traded, where we first normalize each variable by domestic output:

Here, since γ depends on properly measuring the level of Greek absorption of Greek traded valueadded, we add to the WIOD VAX Greek tourism exports reported in the Balance of Payments
scaled by the ratio of value-added to gross output in accommodation and food services to arrive
at a measure of value-added exports.

Additional Model Results

In this appendix we present additional results from the model.
• Figure C.1 presents the path of variables in the model under a first-order (baseline), secondorder, and third-order approximation of the policy functions. Second and third-order approximations are pruned. We start the higher-order approximations at the same initial point
as the first-order approximation, which is the deterministic steady state in 1998. The plotted paths in the higher-order approximation difference out effects arising from differential
transitional dynamics by taking the difference between the path with all innovations and the
path with no innovations.
• Table C.1 presents the priors used in the estimation and various other statistics of the
estimated parameters.
• Table C.2 presents estimated parameters under a higher prior mean for the adjustment costs
of prices and wages. Figure C.2 shows that the model-generated paths of variables under
the parameters estimated with these higher mean priors are similar to the paths under the
baseline estimation.
• Figure C.3 compares model-generated variables to variables in the data without detrending.
For this figure, we reestimate all model parameters. The estimated values for the price and
wage rigidity are ψp = 61 (confidence interval 30 to 91) and ψw = 42 (confidence interval 9
to 76) as opposed to ψp = 47 (confidence interval 21 to 70) and ψw = 38 (confidence interval
6 to 67) in the baseline when we detrend the data.
• Table C.3 presents the sources of macroeconomic dynamics during the first part of the bust
(2007-2012).
• Table C.4 present fiscal multipliers financed with lump sum transfers T o at horizon h = 1
for various alternative parameter values.
• Table C.5 present fiscal multipliers financed initially with deficit B g and then with lump
sum transfers T r and T o at horizon h = 1 for various alternative parameter values.

• Table C.6 present fiscal multipliers financed initially with deficit B g and then with lump
sum transfers T r and T o at horizon h = 7 for various alternative parameter values.

Figure C.3: Model vs Data Without Detrending
Figure C.3 compares data to model-generated variables when we do not detrend the data and reestimate all model
parameters. y is output, ` is labor, k̃ is the capital stock, TFP is total factor productivity, c is consumption, x is
investment, Pc is the price of consumption, and W is wages.
