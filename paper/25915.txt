The Effects of Multispecialty Group Practice on Health Care Spending and Use
Laurence C. Baker, M. Kate Bundorf, and Anne Beeson Royalty
NBER Working Paper No. 25915
June 2019
JEL No. I11
ABSTRACT
U.S. physicians are increasingly joining multispecialty group practices. In this paper, we analyze
how a primary care physician’s practice type – single (SSP) versus multispecialty practice (MSP)
– affects health care spending and use. Focusing on Medicare beneficiaries who change their
primary care physician due to a geographic move, we compare changes in practice patterns before
and after the move between patients who switch practice types and those who do not. We use
instrumental variables to address potential selection by patients into practice types after the move.
We find that changing from a single to a multi-specialty primary care group practice decreases
annual Medicare-financed per capita expenditures by about $1,600 - a 28% reduction. The effect
is driven primarily by changes in hospital expenditures and is concentrated among patients with
two or more chronic conditions, suggesting that MSP improves care delivery by reducing
hospitalizations among relatively sick patients. The results imply that, while research has shown
the potential for physician consolidation to increase prices in some settings, large multispecialty
groups also have the potential to lower costs.

Physician practices in the U.S. have been increasing in size and scope. In 1998, 29% of
physicians worked in solo practices and only 13% worked in practices of 100 or more. By 2010, this
was nearly reversed with 24% of physicians in practices of 100 or more and only 18% in solo
practices (Baker et al., 2018). As the vast majority of very large practices are multispecialty (MSP)
rather than single specialty (SSP), this growth in practice size has been accompanied by a shift
toward MSP. Despite this transition, many physicians continue to work in small practices – in 2010,
40% of physicians worked either in solo practice or in a group with 2 to 9 physicians (Baker et al.,
2018). Continued interest among public and private payers in moving away from volume-based
payment using “alternative payment models” is likely to continue the trend toward larger, more
integrated physician organizations.
While the pervasive view underlying many of these policies is that larger, more integrated
organizations provide care more efficiently primarily through greater coordination of care (Baicker
and Levy, 2013), the literature on physician integration largely does not support this view (Burns,
Goldsmith et al. 2013). In a comprehensive review of the literature from the 1970s to the present,
Burns et al. (2013) find little evidence that these arrangements systematically improve quality or
lower costs. They note, however, several gaps in the literature making it difficult to draw
conclusions from the studies they reviewed. The studies cover a very long time-period during which
the health care market changed in many ways, including the rise of managed care plans and dramatic
developments in the capabilities and use of information technology. In addition, much of the
evidence is based on case studies of one or a few organizations, and study outcomes are often very
basic and, in many cases, self-reported. A recent study documenting that larger practices are
characterized by higher rates of preventable admissions and higher overall spending than their
smaller counterparts also challenges the conventional wisdom larger physicians organization are able
1

to reduce health care expenditures through more effective care coordination (Casalino et al., 2018,
2014).
Against this relatively sparse evidence supporting the beneficial effects of larger, more
integrated provider organizations is a growing body of literature documenting that physician
consolidation increases prices for health care services (Baker et al., 2014b; Dunn and Shapiro, 2014).
While the policy objective of promoting larger organizations is that it may lead to more coordinated
care, the potential downside is that it may generate market power on the part of providers leading to
higher prices for health care services (Baicker and Levy, 2013). Evidence of higher prices, however,
does not necessarily signal that integrated groups are not providing health care more efficiently.
Firms may have different motives for integrating; they may integrate explicitly to achieve market
power or they may integrate with the objective of providing care more efficiently, with the
generation of market power as a by-product (Bresnahan and Levin 2012). Thus, evidence of a
positive relationship between provider market concentration and prices leaves open the possibility
that integration could, on net, have beneficial effects on the efficiency of health care delivery.
However, better evidence of the effects of integration on care delivery is essential for evaluating the
implications of these types of organizational changes for consumers and patients.
In this paper, we analyze how physician practice type – single specialty (SSP) versus
multispecialty practice (MSP) – affects the cost and use of care for U.S. Medicare beneficiaries. We
focus on the organization of primary care practice, as a patient’s primary care physician often serves
as a patient’s agent in navigating the health care system (Fuchs, 1998). Our basic approach is to use
a difference-in-difference design to examine spending and outcomes for patients who move across
geographic areas, comparing those who remain in the same types of practice (SSP versus MSP) to
those who change practice types. By focusing on movers, we observe a set of patients who are
2

required to change the set of providers from whom they receive care for reasons arguably
independent of their health status (Finkelstein et al., 2016). While the decision to move may be
exogenous with respect to health status, the choice of practice type in the destination location may
not be - patient preferences for health care delivery may be correlated with both their health status
and their choice of practice type. To address demand-side selection, we use instrumental variables to
generate exogenous variation in the organization of the practice of the patient’s post-move primary
care physician. The instrument is the market-level organization of primary care practice in the
geographic area to which the patient moved. Our instruments require, however, that market-level
practice-type share affects expenditures only through its effect on patient decisions regarding the
practice type of their primary care physician. Supply-side changes in health care delivery, such as
changes in the organization of insurer markets or hospital-physician integration, may affect marketlevel health care delivery in ways that would create an alternative channel through which patient
choices may be correlated with health care spending and use, violating the assumptions necessary for
the instrument to generate unbiased estimates. Our movers approach offers an important advantage
in addressing this concern. In particular, it allows us to include HHR-by-year fixed effects, enabling
us to control for both fixed and time varying characteristics of markets that may affect both practice
type share and spending outcomes.
We find the MSP decreases Medicare-financed per capita annual medical expenditures by
approximately $1,600 relative to SSP – a 36% reduction. The reduction is concentrated primarily on
hospital spending and on patients with two or more chronic conditions. Taken together, these
results suggest that MSP is more effective at keeping relatively sick patients out of the hospital. Our
results also suggest that multispecialty group practice attracts less healthy patients, and our research
design provides some insight into the source of unfavorable selection into MSPs. While the OLS
results indicate that MSPs are more costly, when we instrument actual practice type switch with
3

share of practice type in the destination HRR, we find that that MSPs have significantly lower costs
per patient than SSPs. Because our difference-in-difference analysis without instruments controls
for unobservable differences in patients that are fixed over time, the deviation between the OLS and
IV results indicates that patients select MSP after the move based on changes in their unobserved
health status around the time of the move.
We improve on existing work by providing one of the first analyses of the effects of
physician organization that is national in scope and is based on administrative data to measure
outcomes; the bulk of the literature is based on case studies of a single or a few organizations and
often relies on self-reported data (Burns et al., 2013). While more recent studies have begun to
analyze broader sets of organizations using administrative data (Casalino et al., 2018, 2014; Weeks et
al., 2010), they have not directly addressed the complex selection issues potentially affecting this
literature. For example, Weeks et al. (2010) compare patients receiving care from large multispecialty
practices associated with the Council of Accountable Physician Practices (CAPP) with patients
receiving care from other physicians in the same market – a mix of physicians who are part of other
multispecialty or single specialty groups or who are unaffiliated. They find that patients in CAPPaffiliated practices – all large MSPs -- had slightly lower costs (3.6%) and higher quality. CAPP
affiliated practices, however, represents only a subset of physicians in the market. As a result, the
findings are unlikely to represent a generalizable effect of MSP on care delivery potentially due to
selection of physician groups into CAPP affiliation, the presence of many patients with primary care
physicians in MSPs in the control group, and the selection of patients into MSP. Our results are
similar to those from a recent study examining primary care physician consolidation which uses
physician relocation to identify the effects of practice organization on health care use (Chen et al.,
2019).

4

Our results provide new evidence for consideration in the development of antitrust policy
with respect to multispecialty group practice by demonstrating that patients receiving care from
primary care physicians associated with multispecialty practices use substantively less care than their
counterparts seeking care from primary care physicians who are not part of multispecialty practice.
While evidence on the effects of MSP on health care quality and outcomes is necessary to fully
evaluate the implications of our findings, any negative effects of the formation of larger
multispecialty groups in the form of higher prices due to greater market power should be weighed
against any increases in efficiency leading to lower costs.

Theoretical Framework
Our theoretical framework focuses on how integration between primary care physicians and
specialists affects health care delivery. In a MSP, physicians of different specialties work together as
part of a single organization. In a SSP, primary care physicians coordinate treatment decisions with
other independent physicians or group practices. The economics literature offers several
mechanisms by which integration between primary care physicians and specialists could increase the
efficiency of health care delivery.
Models based on contract theory emphasize the existence of externalities in production
when separate organizations are involved in joint production. Under these conditions, integration
can lead to higher profits if the integrated organization can internalize the externality (Hart and
Holmstrom, 2010). These theories propose that larger and more integrated organizations may
produce more efficiently when ambiguity exists in the specific tasks necessary for production, when
specific assets are necessary for production, or when difficulty measuring and verifying outcomes
makes it difficult to write contracts that adequately specify the set of possible contingencies relevant
for production (Bresnahan and Levin, 2012). Because each of these characteristics is inherent to the
5

production of health care, integrated organizations, in this case, MSP, may be a mechanism for
overcoming problems of incomplete contracts that hinder coordination among non-integrated
providers.
(Rebitzer and Votruba, 2014), hower, argue that the economic theory on the mechanisms by
which integrated organizations may improve care is not well developed. The clinical literature points
to the potential for integration to facilitate consultation among physicians of different specialties for
patients with complex conditions that are difficult to diagnose and manage:

"Somebody comes in with a very difficult problem and gets taken care of by the internist
and the surgeon and the radiologist and anesthesiologist, all of whom know each other, work
together, eat lunch together," said Dr. Maurice Fox, a retired [Palo Alto Medical] Clinic
endocrinologist. 1
A formal literature points to multispecialty groups as an organizational response to the
“referral problem”, a situation which requires an agent responsible for diagnosing a patient to either
treat the patient or refer the patient to a specialist (Garicana and Santos, 2010). Spot contracts, the
types of payment systems generally used in the absence of integration, create incentives for underreferral – less skilled agents hold on to opportunities for which more skilled agents have a
comparative advantage. Groups, in contrast, through income-sharing arrangements, can create
incentives for efficient referral. Consistent with more efficient referral patterns, Epstein, Ketcham
et al. (2010) demonstrate that greater specialization, in the form of physicians who focus on highrisk deliveries, exists among obstetricians working in groups than among those working individually,

and that greater specialization leads to better matching of patients to physicians and improved health
outcomes.
Group practice, whether single or multispecialty, may also generate economies of scale or
scope. Since many of the costs of monitoring new evidence and implementing appropriate changes
in response have components that are fixed across multiple doctors, economies of scale likely exist
in accessing and internalizing evidence about new medical treatments and technologies. In a study
gathering qualitative evidence on group formation, some physicians expressed the view that groups
need to be at least moderately sized “to create organized processes that will improve care” (Casalino
et al., 2003). The high fixed costs of information technology, such as the implementation of
electronic medical records, is another potential source economies of scale (Gans et al., 2005). While
these examples are driven in part by group size and, thus, are not restricted to multispecialty, as
opposed to single specialty group practice, multispecialty group practices are often larger and able to
spread very high fixed cost investments over an even larger number of physicians or may be able to
take advantage of complementarities across specialties in improving processes of care. Previous
work has reported apparent economies of scale in physician practice size (e.g. (Bradford and Martin,
2000), although has not identified the specific source of these differences.
While these theories point to the potential for efficiencies associated with mulitspecialty
group practice, thre are also reasons why these efficiencies may not materialize. First, large physician
groups have greater difficulty translating group incentives to the behavior of individual practitioners
and weaker individual-level incentives may lead to less effort (Gaynor et al., 2004; Gaynor and
Gertler, 1995), making it difficult to achieve any potential increases in efficiency.
Relatedly, qualitative interviews point to a lack of a tradition of organizational leadership roles
among physicians and, correspondingly, a lack of compensation systems that reward physicians for
organizational leadership (Casalino et al., 2003). Physicians also often cite a desire for autonomy and
7

difficulty in cooperating with each other as barriers to forming groups (Casalino et al., 2003). These
factors may hinder the ability of larger multispecialty groups to drive the types of substantive
changes in care delivery that may be necessary to achieve the gains from greater coordination. The
existence of these types of costs suggests that multispecialty groups will form when the benefits in
the form of greater profitability due to coordinated production are relatively large. They also help to
explain the observed heterogeneity in the decisions of small groups or individuals to form multispecialty organizations since these costs are likely to vary across individuals and small groups.
Finally, economies of scale and scope may be limited. A comprehensive review found limited
evidence on the existence of scope economies and suggested that any scale economies appeared to
be reached by a group size of about 10 – far smaller than most of the multispecialty group practices
observed in the market (Burns et al., 2013).
The impact of larger, more integrated organizations on health care delivery also likely
depends on the financial incentives facing organizations. When delivery organizations receive feefor-service payment, they have incentives to provide more services and more profitable services.
Under payment schemes, such as capitation, in which they bear the financial risk associated with
greater utilization, in contrast, using fewer services and fewer costly services increases profitability.
Thus, how organizations are paid may determine how they use any advantages related to
coordination or economies of scale to increase profitability. For example, larger groups may be able
to respond more effectively to FFS incentives by investing in and using ancillary services that
support large profit margins (Casalino et al., 2003), effectively increasing total cost of care. In
contrast, groups paid by capitation or other risk-bearing payment forms would have incentives to
use these types of services more parsimoniously, effectively lowering cost of care. Thus, the extent
to which and how organizations use greater coordination among physicians to increase profits
depends on the financial incentives facing the organization.
8

In this paper, we study traditional Medicare, a setting in which physicians are paid largely by
fee-for-service, suggesting that greater coordination will lead to greater use of more and more
profitable services that are billed by the organization. Yet, many physicians serve patients enrolled
in Medicare Advantage plans as well as traditional Medicare, and there is evidence that practice styles
developed in response to incentives created by both Medicare Advantage enrollees and Accountable
Care Organizations spill over into outcomes for patients in the practice whose costs are not
reimbursed under these organizations (Baker, 1997; Chernew et al., 2008; McWilliams et al., 2013).
This suggests that it is costly to distinguish between patients within a practice covered by different
types of insurance and that therefore, FFS financial incentives may be blunted in settings where
physicians are treating both managed care and FFS patients.
Finally, research in industrial organization also emphasizes strategic rather than efficiency
motivations for vertical integration – integration can be a tool for consolidating or extending market
power (Whinston, 2007). In other words, firms may not integrate with the objective of increasing
health care efficiency, but rather for charging higher prices or influencing referral patterns. While
there is little evidence on the competitive effects of multispecialty groups, research from physician
and hospital markets suggest that these types of motivations for integration are important. Larger
physician groups charge higher prices (Baker et al., 2014b; Dunn and Shapiro, 2014) and vertical
integration between hospitals and physicians also leads to higher prices for hospital services (Baker
et al., 2014a). In a review of the literature on physician organization, Burns and coauthors conclude
that the scale and scope economies of physician practice are limited and suggest that market power
is a primary motivation (Burns et al., 2013). Thus, integration may not necessarily lead to greater
efficiency in the production of services if the primary motivation for integration is to increase
market power. Our analyses of claims of Medicare patients will, however, pick up only utilization
differences, not price differences, since Medicare operates under administered prices.
9

In summary, our theoretical framework suggests that, while MSP may allow physicians to
provide services more profitably through greater care coordination across physicians, the
implications for expenditures, particularly for physician services are not straightforward. In
particular, fee-for-service payment may create incentives for physicians to leverage greater
coordination to provide more services, particularly those that are both beneficial for patients and
generate payments for physicians. To the extent that larger MSPs are more likely to have riskbearing payment contracts for at least of subset of their patients, however, may dampen these
incentives by making greater utilization less profitable for at least a subset of patients. In the end,
the effects of MSP on health care delivery is an empirical question.

Data
We use data from Medicare claims for 1999-2010. Our data contain information about all
Medicare-billed services provided to a 20% random sample of traditional (fee-for-service) Medicare
beneficiaries during this time period. We use claims from physician offices, hospital outpatient
departments and inpatient hospitalizations.
Study Sample
As described in more detail below, most of our analyses use only a sample of geographic
movers. Beneficiaries are classified as geographic movers if their hospital referral region (HRR) of
residence changes during the financial year (between April 1st of year t and March 31st of year t+1) as
defined by IRS records. We develop our sample following the sample restrictions of (Finkelstein et
al., 2016). We retain individuals over age 65 and under age 99, and those with both Medicare Part A
and Part B coverage but who are not enrolled in Medicare Advantage for each month in the data.
Those beneficiaries with more than one move are excluded to provide cleaner “before” and “after”
move periods. Also following Finkelstein et al. (2016), for movers, we compare the share of claims
10

in the destination HRR before and after the move, and drop those patient-years where the difference
is less than 0.75. This restriction is meant to exclude those who divide time between two residences
and those who do not physically move to a new location but have some reason to change their IRS
address. For comparison purposes, we also retain a 25% random sample (of the 20% Medicare
sample) of non-movers. Non-movers are defined as those observed always residing in the same
HRR.

Measures
Identifying Physician Practice Type
We use Medicare claims to characterize physician practice types. The Medicare claims data
include the physician’s unique identifier, tax ID number of the practice that the physician is affiliated
with, and the physician’s specialty. Following previous work (Baker et al., 2018, 2014b), we identify
physicians reporting the same tax ID numbers on their claims as part of the same practice. In this
study, we restrict our analysis to practices with at least one primary care physician, where primary
care physicians, as defined by CMS, are those reporting specialties of general practice, family
practice, geriatrics and internal medicine. We use the information on physician specialty and the tax
ID-based practice definition to classify practices into two groups: (1) single specialty primary care
practices (SSPs) and (2) multispecialty practices (MSPs). SSPs include both solo and group primary
care practices. For this study, multispecialty groups must include at least one primary care physician
(since we assign patients to practices based on where the patient receives most of his primary care)
and at least one physician specializing in something other than primary care. 2

2

Physicians can have multiple specialties listed in the data and we use only that specialty of the physician that accounts
for the maximum number of claims. Physicians with specialties identified as pediatrics, multispecialty group, osteorelated, other surgery unmatched, and other unmatched specialties were removed from the sample.

11

Claims for all beneficiaries in the 20% Medicare sample are used to categorize practice types
and to construct a measure of the total number of physicians in each practice. In prior work, we
concluded that the 20% sample will include the vast majority of physicians providing services to
Medicare patients (Baker et al., 2018). For example, we found 566,149 unique physician ID’s in the
2010 data. This is consistent with other calculations that, though done in a slightly different way,
reported the number of physicians appearing in the 2010 100% sample of Medicare claims (Welch,
Cuellar et al. 2013). 3
We follow the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) assignment strategy to assign patients
to primary care physicians and thereby practice type (CMS, 2014). Patients must be assigned to a
physician in order to track an ACO’s performance and CMS provides rules for that assignment
when patients see physicians in multiple practices. In our setting this assignment strategy simply
requires that a patient’s home practice is the practice in which she has the maximum charges by a
primary care physician in a particular year. For geographic movers, we assign the beneficiary to a
practice in both the year before and the year after a geographic move. Because we know only the
year of the move and not the exact date, we exclude the year of the move from the analysis and only
examine outcomes in the year before and the year after the move.
Dependent Variables
Key outcome variables include expenditures incurred for physician services, outpatient visits
and inpatient visits. We construct these variables by summing expenditures from claims files within
the year before the move and within the year after the move. Expenditures include those from the

3

As a further way of gaining information about the completeness of the 20% sample data, we computed the number of
unique physician IDs in the 2010 5% sample of Medicare claims. We found 94% of the total in the 20% sample were
also found in the 5% sample. Because nearly all of the physicians identified in the 20% sample are also identified with
only the 5% sample, we take it as unlikely that there would be a large number of additional physicians providing services
to Medicare patients that are not represented in the 20% sample.

12

practice assigned as the patient’s home practice as well as those from practices other than the
patient’s home practice. Total expenditure measures include expenditures on physician and other
provider visits, outpatient visits, and hospitalizations, including both Medicare- and beneficiaryfinanced components of expenditures. We also estimate separate models by expenditures type
(physician, hospital and outpatient) and examine measures of health care use including indicators of
whether the patient was hospitalized one or more time or 2 or more times in a given year.
Control Variables
The claims data provide information on demographics and health status. Demographic variables
include age, sex, and race (white or non-white). We also control for the presence of chronic
conditions including diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, COPD,
asthma, arthritis, hypertension, and high cholesterol, as reported in the CMS Chronic Condition
Warehouse data. In most of our analyses, we restrict the sample to one year before and after the
move.
Methods and Models
Our basic specification is a difference-in-difference model comparing, among Medicare
beneficiaries who experience a geographic move, those who do and do not switch practice type after
their move. Restricting our analysis to Medicare beneficiaries who move allows us to focus on a set
of patients who must change primary care physicians for reasons other than their health status. A
naïve model of the effect of practice type on outcomes using patients that switch to a different
practice type in the absence of a move, in contrast, faces the problem of whether people who
change practice types– say, those moving to a MSP from a SSP—differ from those who did not
move in unobservable ways. Using a sample of geographic movers mitigates this selection problem
because geographic movers must change their physician practice while those who do not move but

13

change practices may be exceptionally motivated – perhaps by unobservable aspects of their health –
to change practices and practice types.
Focusing on our sample of geographic movers, we limit the dataset to one observation for
the year before the move (pre-period) and one observation for the year after the move (post-period),
for each person and estimate the following model on two mutually exclusive samples of movers: (1)
beneficiaries receiving care in a single specialty practice before the move and (2) beneficiaries
receiving care in a multispecialty practice before the move.

i represents an individual,

p represents whether the observation is the year pre- or post-move,
a represents the geographic area as defined by HRR in the calendar year, and
t represents calendar year.

“Switch” turns on in both periods if the person switches practice type after the move,
“Post” indicates that the observation represents the year subsequent to the move, and
“Switch*Post”, the interaction of the two, represents the difference-in-difference estimate of the
effect of changing practice type. We control for the time-varying characteristics of individuals as
described above with 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

The model includes HRR*Year fixed effects, allowing us to control for both fixed and time-

varying characteristics of markets. We can include HRR*Year fixed effects because the treatment,
changing practice type, is not perfectly correlated with either area or calendar year. Because we are
focusing on a sample of movers, each person in the dataset is observed in two geographic areas, an

14

“origin” and a “destination” HRR, and we observe some people moving to and others moving away
from each HRR.
Instruments
While limiting the sample to geographic movers mitigates selection driven by the types of
patients who chose to change practices, movers must choose a new primary care physician practice
after their move, creating the possibility of selection bias based on the types practices patients
choose after the move. Additionally, because we do not observe the exact date of the move, we do
not include data from the year of the move in our analysis. Thus, our estimates could also be biased
if changes in health that occur around the time of the move – in this case an entire year – are
correlated with choice of practice type in the new location.
To address potential bias due to demand-side selection of provider type after the move, we
combine our difference-in-difference framework with an instrumental variables approach. Our
instruments are based on the observation that people moving from the same HRR of origin may
move to destination HRRs with differing distributions of practice types. We expect that the
prevalence of different types of practices in the destination HRR does affect patients’ choice of
practice type but does not affect an individual patient’s expenditures or outcomes through
mechanisms other than practice type choice, conditional on including HRR*Year fixed effects in the
model to control for any changes in the local market.
Specifically, our instrument, Ziat, is the practice type share in the patient’s post-move HRR. Z
varies across, but not over time within individuals. The share of patients in each practice type in the
HRR is calculated using the 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries, and is not restricted to our
sample of movers. In models of patients initially in SSPs and for whom a switch represents a switch
to MSP, we instrument “Switch” with the share of patients in MSPs in the destination HRR in the
year after the move. For those initially in a MSP, we instrument “Switch” with the share of single
15

specialty practices in the destination HRR in the year after the move. We then use those
instruments interacted with the Post dummy as instruments for (Switch to MSP)* Post and (Switch
to Single Spec)*Post.
The identifying assumption is that the practice type share affects expenditures and other
outcomes only through its effect on the decision to switch practice types, conditional on the other
variables in the model. But there are potentially important market factors that are not fixed over
time that could be correlated with the prevalence of MSPs or SSPs in the market. For example,
perhaps markets with an increasing prevalence of MSPs are also markets in which either insurer
concentration or physician-hospital integration are increasing. If these other time-varying marketlevel changes affect expenditures and are correlated with the change over time in practice type
prevalence, then our instruments would be invalid.
We address this concern by including HRR-by-year fixed effects in the model. Although our
instrument, practice-type share, varies by HRR-year, we are able to include HRR-by-year fixed
effects without introducing perfect collinearity because of the way we have structured the data and
how we define our instruments. The instrument is based on physician practice organization in the
patient’s destination HRR. However, we use the patient’s destination share to instrument for switch
in both the origin and destination observations for each patient. This introduces variation in the
instrument within each HRR-Year, breaking the perfect collinearity that would occur if the
instrument was constant within HRR*Year (as would be the case if the instrument were practice
type share in the HRR of residence in the current rather than the destination year). This in turn
allows us to include HRR-by-year fixed effects in the IV model. This is potentially very important
since otherwise it would likely be impossible to control for all the market and other geographic
factors that vary over time within HRRs and could be correlated with the share of practice types in
an HRR and with patient treatment patterns.
16

In the discussion above, we have identified several sources of threats to identification.
When presenting the results, we compare estimates from models with only HRR and year fixed
effects with those from models with HRR-by-year fixed effects as well as estimates from models
with and without instruments to determine the sensitivity of our results to alternative empirical
strategies. We also present information on how movement of patients both in and out of HRRs
allows us to use an HRR-year-level instrument while also including HRR by year fixed effects in the
models.
Results
We identified 119,272 movers, as defined above, during the study period. Table 1 presents
characteristics of movers and a 25% random sample of people who remained in the same HRR
during the study period. We find that movers are slightly older and more likely to be female and
white. Movers, based on residence prior to the move, were more likely to be located in the south
and the west than non-movers. Movers are slightly healthier than non-movers based on the average
number of chronic conditions (2.00 for non-movers and 1.86 for movers), and movers are either
equally or slightly less likely to have each of the conditions we examined.
A substantial number of people change practice type after a move. In Table 2a, which
provides comparisons of the characteristics of patients based on their practice type before and after
the move, we report the number of people in each group. Out of 119,272 geographic movers, 60%
(40% plus 20%) and 40% (24% plus 16%) had primary care physicians in SSPs and MSPs,
respectively, prior to the move. 36% switched practice type after the move with 20% moving from
SSP to MSP and 16% moving the opposite direction.
The groups differ very little in their demographic characteristics including age, sex and race
(Table 2a). Patients initially with MSP primary care physicians are disproportionately located in the
Midwest. There is little difference in the pre-move health status of patients in the different groups.
17

Table 2b provides some information on the size and structure of the two types of groups –
SSPs and MSPs. SSPs tend to be very small groups. Average physician group size is 5 to 6
members for patients seeing SSP primary care physicians. For patients seeing MSP physicians, in
contrast, average group size is 80 to 100 physicians, representing an average of 6 to 7 specialties.

Effects of Practice Type on Total Spending
Table 3 presents the estimates for the key variables of interest: the type of move variables
interacted with Post, which capture the effect of each type of move, after the move, relative to
patients who were cared for in the same type of practice both before and after the move. The OLS
results indicate that moving to a MSP from a SSP is associated with a statistically significant and
large ($1,085) increase in total expenditures, while there is a small, positive but not statistically
significant effect for beneficiaries moving the opposite direction Table 3 – Columns 1 and 2).
In Columns 3 and 4, we include HRR-by-year rather than HRR and year fixed effects to
control for time-varying characteristics of markets that may be correlated with both patient choice of
provider and health care use. We find little evidence, however, of bias from these types of factors.
The estimates in models 3 and 4 from models including HRR by year fixed effects are very similar to
those in columns 1 and 2 which include HRR and year fixed effects.
In columns 5-8 of Table 3, we present estimates from the instrumented versions of Models
1-4. The instrumented models address the possibility of bias generated by a correlation between
unobserved patient characteristics that influence demand for medical care and practice type choice
in the destination HRR. Due to the difference-in-difference design, the instrumented estimates
address changes in patient health status. As discussed earlier, we instrument the switch indicator
with practice type share in the destination HRR. The results indicate that this is an important source
of bias. While the OLS results show an association between higher costs and being treated in a MSP
18

practice (Table 3 – Column 1), the evidence from the IV models shows the opposite. In the IV
specifications, moving to a MSP practice (Table 3 - Column 5) lowers expenditures by
approximately $1600, while the opposite direction move from a MSP to a single specialty practice
(Table 3 – Column 6) increases expenditures by almost exactly the same amount. In summary, using
instruments to control for endogeneity in patient choice of practice type reverses the direction of the
estimate of the effect of changing from a SSP to a MSP and introduces symmetry in the estimates of
switching from one direction to the other.
In columns 7 and 8 of Table 3, we reestimate the instrumented models, including HRR by
year, rather than HRR and year, fixed effects. We find that the estimates are very similar to the
instrumented estimates in columns 5 and 6. This is consistent with the results in columns 1 through
4, which indicate that within-market changes in supply-side characteristics are not an important
source of bias in our analyses.

Identifying Variation
As discussed earlier, while we focus on movers to generate arguably exogenous sources of
changes in practice type, our differences-in-differences strategy faces potential bias from both
demand and supply side sources. From the demand side, patient decisions regarding practice type,
conditional on moving, may be correlated with difficult-to-observe changes in their health status.
For example, among those who move, people with worsening chronic conditions may be more likely
to choose a multi-specialty practice in their new location. From the supply side, changing market
characteristics, such as increasing insurer concentration, may be correlated with both changes in
practice types and patient expenditures. Because we focus on movers, the structure of our data
allows us to address both sources of bias. We instrument patient switching with the share of

19

practices of a particular type in the destination HRR to address patient selection into practice type,
and we include HRR by year fixed effects to control for changing market characteristics.
We are able to adopt both strategies simultaneously because our instrument is not perfectly
correlated with the HRR by year fixed effects. More specifically, the identifying variation is of two
types. First, there is variation due to the fact that two individuals may move from the same HRR in
the same year to different destination HRRs; therefore the instruments based on the practice share
in the destination HRR vary within the Origin HRR*year combination. Second, identifying variation
occurs when, in a given HRR and year, we observe one beneficiary moving into that HRR and
another mover moving out. This creates variation within the HRR*year since the practice share
instrument for movers who moved into that HRR is based on the practice share of the current
HRR, while the instrument for movers who move out of that HRR is based on the practice share in
their new location. Importantly, in this case there is also variation within the HRR*Year in the
share*post instrument because some movers in the HRR*Year are in the pre-period and others are
in the post-period. In short, our ability to control for both demand -and supply-side sources of bias
is based on the fact that we observe market conditions (by controlling for HRR*Year) for patients
both leaving and arriving in a given HRR in a given year, allowing us to control for time-varying
market characteristics. The variable we are instrumenting for, in contrast, is a person-level
characteristic (whether the person switched practice type after the move) which is held constant in
both periods in which we observe an individual even though their geography is changing.
Identification is, thus, dependent upon observing many different HRRs as both origin and
destination locations for patients. In Table 4, we present evidence on the extent to which this type
of variation exists in the dataset. We observe an average of 65 people in each HRR-year. HRRyears are usually observed as both destination and origin locations. In a given HRR, on average,
forty-six percent of these observations are as on origin HRR and 54% are as a destination HRR.
20

For a given HRR in a given year, patients come from and move to many different locations. When
an HRR-year is observed as an origin, it has on average 38 different destination. When an HRR-year
is observed as a destination, patient come from an average of 52 different origins.
Appendix Table 1 presents the first stage results for the IV model. The instruments are
highly predictive and easily pass the weak instruments test.
Interpreting the Differences between the OLS and IV Estimates
Figures 1 and 2 provide a graphical representation of the difference between the OLS and
IV results. In all cases, health expenditures increase after the move. (Note that the estimates in the
figure are not adjusted and part of the increase represents the aging of the sample over the study
period). Focusing on observed switching from SSP to MSP (Figure 1 – Top Panel), the increase in
expenditures associated with the change to MSP is driven by the relatively large increase in
expenditures among patients who change to MSP – an increase of $4,514 to $7,986. The
corresponding change among patients who do not change practice type – they remain in an SSP – is
an increase of $4,402 to $6,749. Thus, the positive OLS estimate of the effect of MSP is driven by
the larger increase in expenditures among those who actually enroll in MSPs after the move. The
graph in the bottom panel of Figure 1, which is based on the predicted probability of enrolling in an
MSP, provides a different story. This figure presents average expenditures for the 1st and 4th quartiles
of the predicted probability of enrolling in either a SSP or MSP based on the share of a given type of
organization in the destination HRR. The increase among those likely to stay in SSP is larger than
the increase in spending among those likely to change. This dynamic underlies the IV estimate of a
negative effect of MSP on spending. The dynamic is similar for beneficiaries who are in MSPs prior
to the move (Figure 2). The change in total expenditure between the pre- and post-move time
periods is similar for the two groups based on their observed switching behavior. The difference in

21

changes over time is greater between the two groups, in contrast, based on the predicted probability
of switching to SSP with the change greater among those with a high probability of switching
A possible explanation for the difference between the OLS and IV results is that
beneficiaries whose health declined more around the time of the move were more likely to choose
multispecialty practices after the move. When we instrument for actual practice type switch with
share of practice type in the destination HRR, that source of endogeneity would be removed,
revealing that MSPs have lower costs per patient than single specialty practices. In other words,
among patients who move and choose a new practice, MSPs differentially attract those whose health
is deteriorating.
The results in Table 3 also suggest that changes in market conditions were not a threat to
validity in this context. Neither the OLS nor the IV results are sensitive to including HRR*Year as
opposed to HRR and Year fixed effects. The HRR*Year fixed effects control for many possible
changes in market conditions that have potential to bias the estimates such as markets with a
growing share of very large practices, markets becoming increasingly concentrated, and markets
experiencing physician integration with hospitals. The similarity between the estimates from models
with and without the HRR*Year fixed effects suggest that these types of factors were not
substantive sources of bias in this analysis. The main limitation of the model with HRR-by-year
fixed effects is that the precision of the estimates declines. Thus, while we present the results of
models including HRR-by-year fixed effects in the main tables as our preferred specification since
they control for both potential sources of bias, we also include the results of models with HRR and
year fixed effects in the appendix for comparison.

The Effects of Physician Practice Type by Type of Spending and by Subpopulation

22

Table 5 illustrates that that these effects are primarily concentrated in expenditures for
hospitalizations as compared to physician or outpatient services. The effects on hospital
expenditures are largest on both an absolute percentage basis. The estimates indicate that a switch
from SSP to MSP decreases hospital expenditures by $1,406, a 58% reduction relative to baseline
expenditures. Similarly, a switch in the other direction, from MSP to SSP increases hospital
expenditures by $1,536. The effects on physician services are generally smaller and not statistically
significant. Those for outpatient services are in the same direction as the effects on hospital
services, but the estimates are imprecise.
One potential mechanism to explain this result could be that coordination of care within a
MSP helps keep patients out of the hospital. To explore that possibility, we next look at the effect
of practice type on hospitalizations. The results in Table 6 support the hypothesis that MSPs are
more effective at keeping their patients out of the hospital. The results suggest that for patients
associated with a MSP before the move, switching to a single specialty practice after the move
increases the probability of having at least one hospitalization in the year after by about 23% relative
to staying in a MSP. The increased probability of having two or more hospitalizations is over 80%.
While moving from a SSP to a MSP reduces the probability of both any hospitalization and two or
more hospitalizations, the estimated effects are smaller in magnitude and not statistically significant.
Lower hospitalizations by MSPs is consistent with the idea that integration lowers the costs of
consultation among physicians of different specialties for patients with complex conditions.
We also examine if our results are driven by, for example, the very sick or the very old, given
that there may be greater opportunity to coordinate care among less healthy patients. In Table 7, we
estimate models of total expenditures separately by number of chronic conditions (0-2 and >2) and
age (65-75 and > 75). As we see in Table 7, the expenditure declines in MSP and increases in single
specialty practices are larger for those with more than two chronic conditions; however, the point
23

estimates suggest that cost savings at MSPs relative to single specialty practices are also seen for
those with fewer than three chronic conditions. Larger effects for those with more chronic
conditions is again consistent with the idea that practice integration across specialties lowers the cost
of coordination by primary care physicians and specialists, since such coordination is likely to be of
greatest value for those with complex health problems such as those with multiple chronic
conditions. The effects of physician practice type are more precise in the models without HRR-byyear fixed effects (Appendix Table 4).
Table 7 also includes results for models run separately for those aged 65-75 and those over
age 75. While only two of the four key results remain statistically significant in these smaller
samples, the patterns remain the same and the point estimates are similar for the two age groups.
Once again we see that once we instrument for switching practice types, those moving to MSPs have
lower expenditures and vice-versa for those switching to single specialty practices. The effects are
not disproportionately concentrated among either the younger or the older elderly.
In Table 8 – Columns 3 and 4, we explore the sensitivity of our results to the definition of
practice type. In particular, we accentuate the difference in practice types by dropping observations
of relatively large SSPs and relatively small MSPs. This potentially makes a cleaner comparison
between the two types of practices. Columns 1 and 2 repeat main estimates from Table 3 for
comparison. When we restrict the two group types by size as described above, the results are
similar, although the positive effect of moving from MSP to SSP is larger and the negative effect of
moving from SSP to MSP is smaller and less precise. But, overall, the effects continue to be large in
magnitude and in the same direction.
In Table 8 -Columns 5-8, we also examine whether the effect we observe varies based on the
level of Medicare Advantage penetration in the market of the beneficiary. We hypothesized that any
negative effects on expenditures could be driven by spillovers from MA to traditional Medicare. We
24

find little evidence to support this as a mechanism driving our results. While the estimates are less
precise due to the smaller sample size in each group, they are similar in magnitude in both low and
high penetration areas.
Conclusions

In this paper, we investigate the effect of multispecialty practice organization on the costs and
use of health care by Medicare FFS beneficiaries. Using a difference-in-difference approach in
combination with an instrumental variables strategy, we focus our analysis on people with an abrupt
change in their primary care physician due to a geographic move and address the issue of selection
into practice type after the move. We find that controlling for patient selection into practice type is
quite important. Results from OLS difference-in-differences models are very different from the IV
DD results. It appears that patients whose health is changing for the worse around the time of a
geographic move are more likely to choose primary care physicians working in MSPs, causing bias in
the OLS estimates and making it appear that MSPs are more costly.
Once we address selection into practice type at the time of the move, we find that
expenditures are lower for patients whose primary care physicians work in MSPs that for those
whose primary care physician is in a SSP. The IV DD models also produce approximately
symmetric estimates for the two types of move: that is, the cost savings when moving to a MSPs are
approximately equal to the cost increases when moving to a single specialty practice. While such
symmetry in the size of the effect would be expected under standard assumptions, we do not
observe that symmetry with OLS, giving further credence to the IV results. The results are robust
to a number of sensitivity checks.
While MSP has the potential to reduce health care costs through greater coordination of care
in the form of, for example, less duplication of services or better management of chronic conditions,
25

there is little evidence in the existing literature that it achieves these types of efficiencies. Our study,
in contrast, suggests that MSP lowers health care spending primarily by reducing inpatient
hospitalizations. While we do not provide direct evidence of the mechanism underlying our result,
this finding is consistent with MSP providing better management of patients with chronic
conditions, particularly since the effect is concentrated among people with two or more chronic
conditions. We did not find evidence that MSP used its ability to coordinate care to increase
referrals to specialist or the use of other types of care that would ultimately increase Medicare
payments.
In summary, our results suggest that MSPs may lower health care spending, providing some
evidence in support of potential benefits from the formation of larger health care organizations.
Thus, any increases in prices due to greater market power must be viewed against reduction in costs
due to lower health care use. An important consideration is the effect on health care quality and
patient outcomes. Additional research should address the implications of lower spending on health
care services for patient health.
