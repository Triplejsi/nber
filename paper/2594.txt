Unemployment Insurance, Recall Expectations and
Unemployment Outcomes

ABSTRACT

This paper shows the importance of explicitly accounting for the
possibility of recalls when analyzing the determinants

of

unemployment spell durations and the effects of unemployment
insurance (UI) on unemployment outcomes in the United States.

These

issues are examined using a unique sample of UI recipients from
Missouri and Pennsylvania covering unemployment spells in the 1979—
1981 period.

We find that those expectjn recall who are

recalled tend

to have quite long unemployment spells.

n

Furthermore,

ex-ante temporary layoff spells (the spells of individuals' who
initially expect to be recalled) may account for over 60 percent of
the unemployment of UI recipients and appear to account for much more
unemployment than ex-post temporary layoff spells (spells actually
ending in recall).

We estimate a competing risks model in which the

finding of a new job and recall are treated as alternate routes of
leaving unemployment.

Our results using this approach show that the

recall and new job exit probabilities have quite different time
patterns and are often affected in opposite ways by explanatory
variables.

We also find that the probability of leaving unemployment

(both through recalls and new job finding) increases greatly around
the time that UI benefits lapse.

Temporary layoffs, where workers are laid of f when demand
declines and often rehired by their original employers, are an
important feature of the U.S. labor market.

Feldstein (1975) and

Lilien (1980) conclude from examinations of establishment data on
turnover that over seventy percent of workers laid of f in U.S.
manufacturing in the 1970's were subsequently rehired by their former
employers.

The layoff—rehire process also appears to be widespread

outside of manufacturing.

Data from the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics for 1980 and 1981 indicate that about fifty percent of heads
of households laid off from nonmanufacturing jobs have unemployment
spells ending in recall.1

Not only do many unemployment spells end

in recall, but a large fraction of the total weeks of unemployment
accumulated by some labor force groups (e.g. unemployment insurance
recipients, manufacturing workers, and prime—age males) occur in
temporary layoff spells.

For example, Feldstein finds that forty

percent of all weeks of unemployment for men age 45—59 in the 1966—71
period were accumulated by individuals who did not change employers,2
This paper shows the importance of explicitly accounting for the
possibility of recalls when analyzing the composition of
unemployment, the determinants of unemployment spell durations, and
the effects of unemployment insurance (UI) on unemployment outcomes
in the United States.

These issues are examined using a unique

unemployment in Canada. Robertson (1988) finds for Canada in 1984
that approximately 35 percent of total weeks of unemployment were
accounted for by persons who eventually returned to their former

The first focus of our empirical work is on the composition of

In particular, we attempt to

determine the fraction of unemployment spells and fraction of time
spent unemployed accounted for by the layoff-recall process. Most

of

clark and Summers (1979) argue that temporary layoffs do not account
for a large share of total unemployment in the United States. The
difference in the conclusions appears to come from the emphasis of
the first papers on joblosers, manufacturing employees, and primeage males, all of whom (like UI recipients) are more likely to be
involved in temporary layoffs. Murphy and Topel (1987) present
evidence for 1968 to 1985 on the fraction of ongoing unemployment

Furthermore, ex—ante temporary layoff spells

The second part of our empirical work shows the value of
explicitly treating the possibility of recall when analyzing
unemployment spell durations.

Models that allow recalls naturally

lead to a competing risks specification of the duration of
unemployment spell in which the finding of a new job and recall are
alternate routes of leaving unemployment (Katz, 1986). This
specification differs from the single risk approach typically used in
most studies of unemployment spell durations.

Our findings using the

competing risks approach shows that the recall and new job exit
probabilities have quite different patterns and are often affected in
opposite ways by explanatory variables.

We also find that the

The duration of unemployment is typically analyzed using a
standard job search model in which unemployed workers generate job
offers by costly search. This approach leads to

a

single risk model

of unemployment spell durations in which unemployment spells can only
end through the finding of an acceptable new job. This formulation is
less appropriate when analyzing the unemployment durations of workers

5
on

layoff

with some possibility of recall. The prospect of recall

affects the probability of leaving unemployment directly through the
rate of actual recalls and indirectly by affecting worker search
behavior. Katz (1986) extends the standard McCall (1970) model of job
search to include an exogenous probability of recall.4

Katz finds

that under reasonable conditions better recall prospects reduce the
new job finding rate by raising the reservation wage and reducing the
likelihood of search.

This suggests that workers who expect to be

recalled may have extremely lpng unemployment spells if their
expectations are not fulfilled.
Katz (1985) also analyzes a model in which unemployed workers
learn about their recall prospects in a Bayesian manner.

He shows

that the longer a worker is unemployed, all else held constant, the
lower will be his or her subjective probability of recall.

This

result leads to a decreasing reservation wage and possibly increasing
search intensity.

Consequently, the new job finding rate for those

who initially expect to be recalled should rise with unemployment
duration (display positive duration dependence) under this scenario.
Furthermore, the statistical model of unemployment spell
durations generated by the job search models extended to allow for
recalls is a competing risks model in which unemployment spells can
end either through recall or the finding of an acceptable new job.5
The predictions of standard job search models for how variables

job search models that incorporate the possibility of recalls.

Mortansen (1977) utilizes a standard dynamic search model with no

on worker

constant rate of job offers.

As the remaining number

of

of

benefits decreases, the value of remaining unemployed also decreases.
This drop causes search intensity to rise and the resenatiom wage to

fall

as an individual gets closer to when benefits lapse.

These

changes in behavior imply that the hazard rate (or escape rate) from
unemployment rises till the date of benefits exhaustion and stays

On

the other hand,

if

can locate jobs and arrange mot to begin work until their

benefits run out, one could find a discrete increase in the escape
rate near the point of benefits exhaustion.

An alternative approach is taken by Moffitt and Nicholson

(1982)

who use a static model where unemployed workers have preferences over

7

income and unemployment.

Some unemployment is valued because of its

leisure component and because one can search while unemployed.

At

the tine of job loss, individuals choose income and weeks of
unemployment subject to a budget constraint.

The budget constraint

has a convex kink at the week of UI exhaustion because unemployment
ceases to be subsidized.

This kink implies that there may be a

bunching of unemployment spell durations around the time benefits
lapse.
Mortensen

(1987)

analyzes a joint wealth maximizing model of job

separations with transitory demand changes facing firms and limited
duration of unemployment benefits.

The discrete change in the flow

value of being unemployed when benefits are exhausted yields the
prediction that many firms may recall laid-off workers around the
benefit exhaustion point.
The theoretical models of unemployment spell durations surveyed
indicate the importance of explicitly taking into account the recall
process and the limited duration of unemployment benefits when
analyzing the unemployment spells of UI recipients.

II. Data Description: The Missouri—Pennsylvania

UI Recipients Sample

We use a unique data set to determine the fraction of
unemployment of UI recipients due to ex-ante and ex—post layoffs and
the relation of recall expectations to worker job search behavior.
The data set consists of a sample of unemployment insurance
recipients from Missouri and Pennsylvania beginning their
unemployment insurance benefit years during the period October 1979

8

to March igso.6

The data set ccmbines records collected by the

Unemployment Insurance Service under the Continuous Wage and Benefit
History (CWBH) system with ipformation from special supplemental
telephone interviews ccnducted in late 1980 and early 1981.

The CWBH

data include recall expectations, pre—Ul weekly income, and
demographic veriebles obtained from a survey administered when
individuals tiled for UI.

Also included are edministrative records

The construction of

original data set is described by Corson and Nicholson (1983)
The major advantage of this deta set is that it provides
information on whether individuals expected to be recalled at the
time they filed for UI benefits, on how their initial unemployment
spells ended, end on the level end length of unemployment insurance
benefits available to each individual. Most previous work has used
either CWBH data or survey date in isolation. Studies using only CW8H
data (e.g. Moffitt, 1985; Meyer, 1988) miss the period prior to
61n other words, the individuals in the sample all filed for
unemployment insurance benefits during the October 1979 to March 1980
period. The initial unemployment spells for almost all of these
individuals began during this time interval. The rare exceptions are
those individuals with unemployment spells that began before October
1, 1979, but who did not file an unemployment insurance claim until
after October 1, 1979,

version of the data set we utilized to extract our sample.

filing for UI, the uncensored length of spells for those who exhaust
benefits, and whether spells end through recall or the finding of a
new job. Studies using micro survey data sets such as the Panel Study
of Income Dynamics or National Longitudinal Survey (e.g.

Dynarski and

Sheffrin, 1987. Katz, 1986) tend to have poor information on the UI
system parameters facing unemployed individuals and may have greater
measurement error because of the retrospective nature of many of the
questions.

One disadvantage of the data set that we use is that it

contains individuals from only two states over a short time period so
that there is not a great deal of variation in the UI system
parameters.

A second disadvantage is that the data set does not

allow us to examine the unemployment experiences of those who do not
receive UI.

This is an important issue because a large and

increasing fraction of the unemployed in the U.S. are not UI
recipients
The original Missouri-Pennsylvania telephone interview data set
contains 2035 observations. Exclusions for missing demographic data
end incomplete or inconsistent information on unemployment spells
leaves a sample of 1499 observations.9

Since the data set consists of a sampling of workers beginning
unemployment insurance spells within a reasonably short interval in
each state, the sample provides an approximation to a random sample
drawn from the inflow of UI recipients into unemployment.10 For an
economy in a steady state, the distribution of first spells of
unemployment of entrants into unemployment is the same as the
distribution of the completed spells of a orosssection of the
unemployment

unemployed.

This provides some justification for analyzing the

characteristics of initial unemployment

spellsJ

Our further

justification is that the data set provides much better informstion
on first spells then on total unemployment in the benefit year for
unemployment spell, or irreconcilable inconsistencies among their
claim dates, spell start dates, and spell end dates were deleted.
10Wbila the entire sampling frame covers UI spells beginning
from October 1979 to March 1980, the vast majority (95 percent) of
the individuals from Missouri have benefit year begin dates in from
November 1979 to Jenuary 1980 end the vast majority (92 percent) from
Pennsylvania have benefit year begin dates from January to March 1980.

0ne

problem with the data set is that the steady state
assumption is likely to be violated, First, since the sample
includes individuals with spells starting in the fourth and first
quarters, meny seasonally unemployed workers are likely to be
included. This is especially likely in Pennsylvania since most of the
sample has unemployment spells beginning in the first quarter. The
likely importance of seasonal unemployment means one must be somewhat
cautious in drawing inferences concerning the distribution of
unemployment over the full year from this sample, Second, fewer
weeks of UI benefit eligibility, if any, are likely to be remaining
for second or third unemployment spells in a benefit year. Thus, the
incentives during the first unemployment spells examined here are
different from those in a random sample of unemployment spells of UI
recipients.

and Missouri.

These two measures can be computed for both Pennsylvania
PAYSPELL is an alternative measure that more fully

utilizes administrative records on the actual number of weeks of
benefits received, but it can be computed only for individuals from

All three unemployment spell measures lead to similar

conclusions concerning the fraction of unemployment due to either
spells ending in recall or individuals who expected recall.

The

analyzing the distribution of unemployment spell durations.
is defined as weeks from UI first payment date until
reemployment (or until the interview date if the first unemployment
spell is still in progress at the interview date). We utilized
administrative records rather than respondent retrospective
information whenever possible in constructing PAYSPELL. CWBH
administrative information on the first payment date and on the weeks
of benefits received in the benefit year were only available for
Missouri. For individuals who had a single compensated unemployment
spell in the benefit year and who gained reemployment before benefits
were exhausted, PAYSPELL can be computed from CWBM administrative
records and equals the weeks of benefits received in the benefit
year. Since the available CWBH data does not disaggregate the total
number of weeks of benefits received in a benefit year into
individual spells of compensated unemployment, we were forced to use
respondent retrospective information on weeks of benefits received
for individuals with multiple compensated unemployment spells in the
benefit year. In this case, PAYSPELL equals the survey respondent's
self—reported weeks of benefits received during his or her initial
unemployment spell. For individuals who exhausted their benefits
during their initial unemployment spell, PAYSPELL is given by weeks
from the UI first payment date (from CWBH records) until the self—
reported reemployment date (or until the interview date if the spell
is censored)

in Pennsylvania and only 51 percent in Missouri.

The rules concerning the level and duration of UI benefits were
much more generous in Pennsylvania than in Missouri during the period
of our sample.15 In particular, the maximum weekly benefit available
was $105 in Missouri and $170 in Pennsylvania in 1980.

In fact, the

mean weekly benefit amount of $125 for individuals from Pennsylvania
in our sample is greater than the maximum possible benefit in
Missouri.

Pre-Ul earnings were similar in the two states leading to

a much higher replacement rate in Pennsylvania.

Regular UI benefits

in Pennsylvania had a uniform duration of 30 weeks, while Missouri
had a maximum potential duration of 26 weeks with variation in the
potential duration that depended on base period and high quarter
earnings.

The Missouri sample provides substantial variation in the

potential length of benefits, while the Pennsylvania sample provides
almost none. Extended benefits were triggered in February 1980 in

Pennsylvania

and in May 1980 in Missouri.

The extensions raised the

potential length of benefits to 39 weeks in Pennsylvania and
increased the potential length by fifty percent in Missouri.
The extent to which firms' UI payroll taxes depended on their
previous layoff rates also differed greatly in the two states.

A

firm's future payroll taxes increased with layoffs until the firm's
unemployment rate reached 6.3 percent in Missouri as compared to 3.6
percent in Pennsylvania.

On the other hand, Topel (1985) calculates

On the other hand, very few individuals in the sample reported
weeks of benefit receipt the same as indicated by their CWBH records.
Only 15 percent of the 561 individuals in Missouri with a single
spell of unemployment in the benefit year reported weeks of benefit
receipt equivalent to the number provided by administrative records,

determinants of unemployment spell durations

Reca11ptatlons, JobSearch

and

theCposijonofUnipygnt

The usual method of assessing the contribution of temporary
layoffs to unemployment uses an ax-post concept of temporary layoffs
(Feldstein, 1975; Lilian, 1980)

Ex—post temporary layoffs are

unemployment spells that end through rehire to the original employer.
This concept is appropriate if one Is interested in the amount of
unemployment that does not involve a change in employers.
This concept is not the correct one for assessing the
contribution of the temporary layoff process to total unemployment,
The ax—post approach does not take into account the fact that some
workers who expect to be recalled at the tire of layoff are not
recalled or find other jobs before being recalled. Workers expecting
recall whose expectations are not met, may have quite long
unemployment spells since they are unlikely to search intensively for
a new job as long as they regard the probability of recall to a

valuable old job as high.

If these workers receive UI benefits, they

may be willing to wait as long as the benefits last before searching
for another job.

Imperfectly experience—rated firms may have an

incentive to encourage workers in whom they have invested to wait for
recall.

Other employers may be unwilling to incur the initial fixed

costs of hiring and training workers with reasonable prospects of

17
recall to

a

more attractive job.

These factors suggest an ex— ante

temporary layoff concept as the proper measure of the amount of
unemployment affected by the layoff-recall process. We define ex-ante
temporary layoff unemployment as the unemployment arising in spells
in which the individual expected to be recalled at the time of
layoff.

The recall expectations information in our Missouri—

Pennsylvania data set allows us to compare this unemployment concept
with the usual ax-post temporary layoff approach.
Table 2 presents the distribution of first unemployment spells
and weeks of first spell unemployment by spell outcome, recall
expectations, and definite recall status for our entire sample using
the ItJSR unemployment concept.

Since it is unlikely that many of the

long censored spells ended in recall, it appears reasonable to
conclude that about 57 percent of the unemployment spells and 32
percent of the weeks of unemployment of UI recipients in our two
states are accounted for by ax-post temporary layoffs.17

The typical

spell ending in recall was substantially shorter than those ending in
the finding of a new job.

Less than 10 percent of unemployment is

accounted for by spells in which individuals had a definite recall
date.

On the other hand, almost 64 percent of unemployment is

accounted for by ex-ante temporary layoffs. Table 3 yields
qualitatively similar findings for Missouri alone using the PAYSPELL
unemployment Spell measure which more fully uses available
17The share of
unemployment accounted for by temporary layoffs
is likely to be overstated in this sample relative to a random sample
of unemployment spells over the calendar year since most of the
spells started in the peak period for temporary seasonal layoffs

UI recipients who cx ante expected to be recalled and ax post were
not recalled tend to have quite long unemployment spells. While this
flanfiftsercent

group accounts for only 21 percent of the entire sample, it accounts
for approximately 34 percent of first spell unemployment.

Since many

of the individuals of this group had spells censored at the interview
date, 34 percent may be an underestimate.18
One plausible reason why those who expect be recalled but are not
tend to have long unemployment spells is that they may rationelly
decide to wait for recall and not search very intensively for a new
job.

(They may also have a difficult time gaining new jobs since

employers will be reluctant to hire those likely to return to their
old jobs.)

of the UI recipients in our sample.

This result is consistent with the finding

of Barron and Mellow (1979) that those who classify themselves as
being on "temporary layoff" in the Current Population Survey spend
less time searching than do other individuals who classify themselves
as unemployed. Low search intensity may play a role in the low rate
of new job finding of those who expect to be recalled.
One may be interested in the distribution of total weeks of
unemployment in
unemployment.

a

benefit year rather than just first spell

If some groups have proportionally more unemployment

in second and third spells, examining only the first spell would give
a distorted picture of the distribution of unemployment.

This bias

would occur if past unemployment was either an inoculation against
future unemployment or a cause for greater difficulty in finding and
keeping a job.

While the data set does not allow the construction of

a good measure of total unemployment weeks in the benefit year, it
does provide information on total weeks of compensated unemployment
(Weeks of UI benefit receipt) for the Missouri sample.

This measure

is also directly relevant for evaluating the fraction of UI benefits
accruing to individuals involved in temporary layoffs.
The distribution of total compensated unemployment in the benefit
year by outcome of the first spell and first spell recall
expectations is presented in Table 6.

Individuals whose first spell

ended in recall account for almost 41 percent of the total weeks of
compensated unemployment.

This percentage is substantially larger

20
than their share of total weeks of first spell unemployment.

This

difference arises because those recalled are more likely to have
multiple spells of UI receipt in a year and because weeks of

A

reasonable

conclusion from this table is that a large fraction (maybe 40 percent

or more) of the weeks of compensated unemployment in Missouri in this
period were accounted for by ax-post temporary layoff Spells.
finding is quite similar to that of Robertson (1988)

This

for Canada.

Robertson finds that 44 percent of total UI weeks in Canada in 1984
were accounted for by ex-post temporary layoffs.

Thus, a substantial

proportion of insured unemployment in both the U.S. and canada
appears to be related to the layoff—recall process.

mentEarnins
An important element in the evaluation of the success of a UI
program is the effect of UI on the wages of reemployed workers.
Table 7 provides information on the post—UI job earnings relative to
pre-Ul job earnings of those individuals in the Missouri-Pennsylvania
sample reemployed by the interview date.19

Those with unemployment

spells ending in recall appear to go back to their old jobs since
their post-UI hourly earnings are quite similar to their pre-Ul

19Pre—UI earnings are from information provided by respondents
at the time that they made their UI claims. Post-UI earnings are
from the follow-up survey. The choice of deflator (Average Hourly
Earnings vs. CPI) affects conclusions about the magnitude of earnings
changes. The earnings losses are substantially larger when the CPI
is used as the deflator. On the other hand, the choice of deflator
does not substantively affect any conclusions concerning relative
earnings changes of any of the groups compared.

21
hourly earnings. On the other hand, the usual weekly hours of those
rehired by their previous employers do decline by about 4.5 percent
on average.

The reduced hours of those recalled suggest may relate

to the cyclical downturn that gained force by the middle of 1980.
Individuals with spells ending through the finding of new jobs
typically experienced substantial earnings declines.

In particular,

the hourly earnings of those who expected to be recalled but were not
fell by 15 percent on average, while new job finders who did not
expect to be recalled experienced 11 percent earnings losses on
average.

Table 7 also illustrates that individuals who exhausted

their benefits experienced the largest earnings declines by a
substantial margin.

Their hourly earnings declined by 30 percent on

average and their weekly earnings declined even further.

The large

losses of exhaustees suggest that reservation wages are likely to
fall substantially and that the new job finding rate is likely to
increase substantially as benefits run out.

An alternative

explanation for the low relative reemployment earnings of those with
long spells is heterogeneity in reemployment prospects.

Workers with

low job offer arrival rates are likely to have both low reservation
wages and low escape rates from unemployment for many plausible wage
offer distributions

(Mortensen, 1986).

These basic differences in the recall and new job finding

This suggests that workers may stop

waiting for recall and start taking new jobs as their benefits run
out.

In fact, when we look only at workers who indicated when their

spells began that they expected to be recalled, the new job finding
rate is extremely low early in spells and there is a prolonged sharp
increase in the new job escape rate from four weeks before exhaustion
through three weeks after exhaustion.

support for the Mortensen (1987) joint wealth maximizing model of the
layoff-recall process. The model predicts many recalls occurring when

spells are positive randam variables which are often censared (9,3

Many important explanatory

conditions, etc.) change values during an unemployment spell.

The

entire time path of time—varying explanatory variables and the
possible censoring of the dependent variable are easily incorporated
in a hazard model.
We use a proportional hazards model estimator that allows for
time—varying explanatory variables and which nonparametrically
estimates the change in the hazard over time.

This semiparametric

approach is analyzed in detail in Meyer (1986).

The estimates are

the parameters of a continuous time hazard model and thus retain a
clear interpretation.

Nonparametrically estimating the change in the

hazard over time eliminates the need to impose

restrictive functional form that has no theoretical justification.
If an incorrect functional form were assumed,
estimates from the model would be inconsistent.

The

recall and new job finding hazards.

The large and significant increases in the recall and new job
hazards apparent in Figure 4 at the week of benefits exhaustion are
strongly confirmed in the more sophisticated hazard model estimates.
Higher UI benefits are associated with higher recall rates and lower
new job finding rates.

The UI benefit coefficients in the new job

hazard appear reasonable; higher benefits greatly depress the new job
finding rate, and this effect disappears after benefits are
exhausted.

The positive and significant coefficient in the recall

hazard is a puzzle.

High UI benefits may be linked to the short-term

temporary layoff sector of the Missouri economy.

The effect of UI

and the pre-Ul wage on the total hazard are of opposite sign from the
findings of most studies, although they are not statistically
significant.

The odd UI benefit coefficient estimates may arise

because the variation in benefits in Missouri has a peculiar form:
over 71 percent of the sample received either exactly $105 or exactly
$85 in benefits.

Variation in benefits across states and points in

time is usually available in studies finding that UI benefits
increase unemployment spell durations (e.g.

Ehrenberg and Oaxaca,

1976; Meyer, 1988).

6Although uncontrolled heterogeneity biases estimates of the
overall hazard towards spurious findings of negative duration

individual escape route hazard in a competing risks framework. If
uncontrolled factors that raise the recall hazard also lower the new

dependence in the new job hazard. Han and Hausman (1986) have

27Whether or not the gamma distribution is sufficiently flexible
is a subject of debate. Hecknan and Singer (1984) argue that it is
not, but their results come from am example where a fairly
restrictive parametric form for the baseline nazard is assumed.
Ridder and 'Jerbakal (1983) offer some evidence that the gamma
distribution does fairly well. Some pralzminary Monte Carlo
experiments by one of the current authors indicates that coefficient
estimates are relatively insensitive to the distribution of
heterogeneity when the baseline hazard is estimated nonparametrically.

32
unemployment rate and occupation dummies were always insignificant.
The behavior of the search variable again illustrates the usefulness
of the competing risks approach.

In the total hazard the search

variable comes in negative and highly significant, implying that
those who search initially are reemployed less quickly,

However,

this may arise because initial search acts as a further proxy for the
likelihood of recall.

Those who strongly expect to be recalled may

not search and may also be recalled quickly.

The recall and new job

hazard estimates provide some support for this interpretation.

The

search variable has a large negative value in the recall hazard, but
is small and insignificant in the new job hazard.
Overall, the lack of variation in the UI parameters within
Missouri suggests the need to look at a date set covering more states
and a longer time period to more accurately determine the impect of
the length and level of UI benefits on spell durations,28

The

results with the Missouri sample do indicate that the recall process
plays a major part in determining the duration of unemployment spells
of UI recipients and the increase in unemployment escape rate around
when benefits lapse,
We also examined hazard model estimates for the Pennsylvania
subsample, though we were less confident about the accuracy of the
spell lengths since their derivation relied more heavily on survey
responses rather than administrative records,

V. Conclusion
This paper has examined the extent to which the unemployment of
UI recipients in the U.S. can be attributed to alternative concepts
of temporary layoffs and the impact of the potential duration of UI
benefits on the distribution of unemplonent spell durations of UI
racipiants.
We find that an understanding of the layoff-rehire process is
critical to understanding the composition of unemployment
(particularly insured unemployment) in the United States,

Over 30

percent of the total weeks of unemployment of UI recipients in
Missouri and Pennsylvania were attributable to unemployment spells
ending in recall,

Tx-ante temporary layoffs (those in which the

individual initially expected to be recalled) may account for over 60
percent of the unemployment of UI recipients.

Individuals who

initially expect to be recalled search less intensely for new jobs
than other UI recipients and tend to have extremely long unemployment
spells if they are not actually rehired by their original employer.
The recall rate is quite high at short spell durations and right
around the point at which UI benefits lapse.
The potential duratict of UI benefits appears to have a

29Solon (1981) found a similar result in am examination of CWBH
data for 3 states during the 1978—79 period.

35
substantial impact on the length of the .anamployment spells of U.S.
UI recipients.

Our findings indicate that the probability of leaving

unemployment (both through recalls and new job finding) increases
greatly around tha time that benefits are exhausted.

Furthermore,

some rough sioulationa based on hazard model estimates for taelve
states in Katz and Meyer (1988) indicate that an increase in the
potential duration of benefits of tne size that naturally occurs when
a state passes through an extended benefIts trIgger increases the
mean weeks of corpensated oneoployrent in a benefit year by 15
percent (2.6 weeks1.

This is a large effect given that most spells

are corpleted well before regular benefits run out,

In fact, the

impact of the extended benefits trigger on the duration of UI
recipient unemployment spells ix estimated to be almost identical to
the io'pact of a uniform

2')

percent increase in the level of benefits.

Alterstively, Moffitt and Nicholaon '1982, using a labor supply
estimatIon framework find that a one—week Increase in the potential
duration of benefits increases the length of an average spell by 0.1
week.
These findings cuggeats that a further examination of the impact
of the potential length of UI benefits on onemployment could be quite
useful.

Most work on the effects of UI focuses on differences in

replacement rates or experience rating provisions,

Rules concerning

potential benefit durations very greatly across OECD countries with
the typical potential duration ranging from 26 weeks in the United
States, to two end a half years in Denmerk, and to a virtually
unlimited duration in Belgium (Emerson, 1988).

Shorter maximum

36
durations of UI and the much greater importance of the layoff-recall
process

may play a major role in the lower incidence of extremely

long—term unemployment in the U.S. and Canada than in most European
countries.

workers to the following question: "I'd like to ask you about the period of
time after that job [pre-Ul job[ ended. Did you look for work at that time?"
Workers who answered yes to this question were later asked "And about how many
hours per week on the average would you say you spent looking for work?"
