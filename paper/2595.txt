MARXET STRUCTURE• STRIKE ACTIVITY • AND UNION WAGE SETTLEXENTS
Abstract
We attempt a synthesis

of

the industrial relations market structure hypothesis

with the modern asymmetric infonsation theory of wage and strike outcomes.

The

industrial relations literature contains a variety of arguments indicating that wage
settlements should be positively related to the degree of product market sales
concentration and the degree of product market coverage by the union. An asymmetric
information bargaining model is specified

that relates these same variables to strike

probabilities as well as wage settlements.
Our empirical analysis is conducted for the periods from 1970-1980 (strikes)
1976-1980

(wages).

and

We find that the relation between trade-adjusted sales

concentration and wage settlements is positive at low levels of concentration hut
negative at high levels of concentration. The relation is always negative for strike
probabilities. We also find that the relation between the trade-adjusted percent of
the product market covered by the same

union

and the percentage covered by other union

are positively related to both wage settlements and strike probabilities. Our
empirical analysis includes a rich set of controls including unrestricted time and
industry

I. Introduction

The market structure hypothesis in the industrial relations literature postulates
that unions should have the greatest power when they are effectively organized in
noncompetitive industries. According to this hypothesis, two key determinants of the
level of union wages are the firm's "ability to pay" and the union'a "ability to
appropriate". In this paper we empirically test these predictions by incorporating
measures of the market structure ard the bargaining structure in both union wage
settlement and strike equations. We also introduce a modern asymmetric information
theory that predicts the effects of market and bargaining structure variables on
strike probabilities and wage settlements. The information asymmetry model is used to
resolve some of the anomalies in the estimated equations that are not consistent with
the market structure hypothesis.

The market structure hypothesis can be traced back to John R. Commons'
discussion of the American Shoemakers)
the dynamics

of

(1909)

Commons argued that prior to the Civil War,

the shoemaker's trade union movement was driven by market developments

and not by technological developments (j,. changes in the footwear production process
itself).

The modern formulation of the market structure hypothesis evolved out of two

long standing empirical observations concerning union wage determination. Ross and
Gardner (1950) and Segal (1961) demonstrated, using aggregate data, that union wage
levels are increasing in the level of unionization and in the level

concentration in the industry.

of sales

A theoretical literature developed that attempted to

rationalize these empirical findings (See Garbarino (1950) and Schlesinger (1958)).
The hypothesis was not without its critics, however.

Rees (1962) argued that the

in its
hypothesis had no clear theoretical foundation and that the empirical evidence
support was inconclusive. While a noncompetitive market structure may increase the
firm's ability to pay, Rees pointed out that it may also increase the firm's incentive
to resist unionism.

The fact that the oligopolistic industries were the last to be

Further doubt

was cast on the hypothesis by Lewis (1963), Weiss (1966), and Rosen (1969) who found a
negative union wage coefficient on the interaction between coverage and concentration.
Fees' critique led to

a series of papers that developed and refined the market

structure hypothesis (See Livernash (1963), Segal (1964), and Levinaon (1967)).

We have also expanded the typical specification to

include several new variables. Union coverage rates are adjusted to reflect the
nonunion labor component embodied in imported goods.

Overall union coverage in the

industry is disaggregated into coverage by the union representing the bargaining unit
and coverage by all other unions.

In addition, we disaggregate nonunion coverage into

domestic and foreign components. Finally,

of Race' theoretical critique of earlier formulations of the hypothesis.
The ability of the firm to pay wage premis

ability to pass on higher labor costs and its ability to offset higher labor coats
through reductions in other production costs.

The degree to which the firm can shift

the incidence of wage preaia to other agents in the economy is determined by four
factors:

the level of concentration in the industry;

the extent

of "spatial

limitation" that exits in the product market; whether the firm is in a regulated
industry;

and the importance of government contracts and subsidies in the industry.

Firms that exercise considerable market power in an industry can finance wage
premia out of the rents generated by nonmarginal coat pricing.

In this case, the

incidence of the wage premia can be thought of as being shifted in part onto consumers
through higher prices. However, the wage premia may instead simply reflect a transfer
of rents from the firm's equity holders to the union members with no significant
change in the product price occurring. This would be the case if the union contract
reflected a bargaining outcome on a vertical contract curve±

Empirical evidence

2This is the "strong efficiency" bargaining outcome as described in Brown
and Ashenfelter (19g6). See Abowd (1987) for evidence that unexpected changes
in the value of a union contract generate on average dollar for dollar

suggests that there is a nonlinear relation between concentration and profitability
(See Scherer (1980)).

Marginal increases in concentration do not lead to significant

increases in profitability until the industry becomes highly concentrated.
Consequently, we might expect that there will exist a nonlinear relation between
concentration and union wages and between concentration and strike activity.
There are several problems in using the four firm sales concentration data as

of domestically produced
published in the Census of Manufacturing. First, only sales
goods are included in the concentr

don

calculation. Variations in the level of

concentration across industries at a point in time or within an industry across time
and
may not accurately reflect variations in market power due to cross-sectional
time-series variation in import penetration. Second, concentration figures may
overstate the degree of market power in those industries characterized by a few large
rent
buyers of the industry's output.3 In this situation, much of the noncompetitive
may be appropriated by buyers of the product through price discounting. Finally,

the

unadjusted concentration figures do not take into account possible spatial limitations
of the product market or patent protection for specific product lines.4
The Federal government has played an important role in collective bargaining in
two respects.

Government regulation of an industry may increase a firms ability to

in
pay wage premia by allowing the firm to pass through any increase in labor costs
the form of a rate increase.

Regulation, then, helps to take the wage "out of

competition". Examples include the trucking, railroad,

airline,

and telephone

industries. Recent deregulation of many of these industries provides a natural test
transfers between equity holders and union members.
3An example is the tire and tube industry.
4The newspaper industry is an example of an industry with spatially
limited product markets. Within the industry, the degree of concentration is
quite low, although within a city, the degree of concentration is typically
quite high. The pharmaceutical industry is an example of an industry in which
the level of concentration is low although firms may earn noncompetitive
returns on individual patented drugs. Weiss (1966) developed an adjusted
concentration series that incorporated these concerns.

Industries that do a significant amount of contract

work for the Government may also be in a better position to finance wage premia. A
"cost-plus' contract allows the firm to pass on to the government increases in overall
labor costs.

Examples include the aerospace industry.

In addition to rent-sharing or shifting the incidence of labor cost increases
onto consumers or the government, firms can attempt to offset higher union wages

the

As Rams pointed out, noncompetitiwe market structures are not a sufficient
condition for high union wage levels.

The union must also be "effectively organized"

so as to be able to make the firm pay a wage premis.

Three factors that govern the

ability of the union to appropriate rents are the extent to which the union has
organized the "relevant" work force; the absence of "competitive unionism" in the
industry;

and whether the union has put in place the "appropriate" bargaining

structure.
Ocganizscion of the relevant work force allows the union to take the wage out of
competition. What constitutes the "relevant" work force will vary by industry and
and try and regulate
occupation. Craft unions need to organize all skilled workers

In contrast, industrial unions need to

plants during strikes,

be
Similarly, regional redistribution of production must

offset by new ocganization drives.

The rise of the mini-mill steel companies in the

South is an example of this problem.

9

Spatial considerations are also important for defining the relevant work force.
If the product market is spatially limited or a key aspect of the production process
is spatially limited,

then,

the union need not organize the entire work force.

Levinaon (1967) introduced the notion of spatial limitation.
"Under this type of industrial structure, the union need only achieve a high
degree of organizational strength within the limited strategic areas
involved in order to be protected against the undermining effects of new
nonunion entrants or of runaway shops, irrespective of how easy entry into
the industry itself might be." (p. 202)
For example,

longahoring unions need only organize a few seaports rather than the

entire shipping process to he effectively organized. A second example is the
construction industry where the relevant work force is defined at a local level.
In addition to organizing the relevant work force, effective unionism requires
that the structure

of

the organization is not fragmented between competing unions.

Craypo (1986) distinguishes between competitive unionism and "rival" unionism.
Competitive unionism refers to two or more unions that work against each other in
economic bargaining because they represent parts of the same relevant work force,
contrast,

In

rival unionism refers to two or more unions that represent different

relevant groups of workers within the same firm or industry.

An

example

of the problems inherent in a fragmented bargaining structure is the

post-war experience of the electrical workers at General Electric (GE).

In 1946 the

United Electrical Workers (UE) union was involved in a two month strike with GE in an
attempt to force GE to match wage increases that had been negotiated in the auto and
steel industries. In response to this costly strike, GE adopted a take-it-or-leava-ic
bargaining philosophy that has since been named after its originator Lemuel Boulware.
The firm marketed its "fair, firm" offer directly to its workers rather than going
through the unions.
The practice met with considerable success during the 1950's in part due to the
fragmentation that was taking place in the structure
coverage.

of

GE's

bargaining strategy came in

1969 when a Federal Appeals Gourt upheld an unfair labor practice charge against GE by
finding that "Boulwareimm" constituted a violation of the "duty to bargain in good
faith".

The third factor in determining the effectiveness of a union's organization is
the bargaining structure used by the union.

The appropriate bargaining structure will

depend on the structure of the product market and/or production process.

Ideally,

the

bargaining mtructure should be broad enough to cover all workers whose products are
sold in competition. This does not require that a single contract cover all of these
workers.

Strong settlement patterns may serve as a substitute for a common contract

(See Livernash (1963)).

There are two advantages that are derived by a union from

having the appropriate structure.
"Because the relevant work force includes workers producing goods or
services that sell in competition, a union aim is to expand the bargaining
structure or pattern to include them all to obtain the greatest union impact
during strikes.
Bargaining structures should be sufficiently centralized to
ensure that economic terms and conditions affecting the relevant work force
are negotiated at the same time. This structure removes the relevant work
force from economic competition." (Craypo (1986). p. 34)

One counter balancing factor is that as the bargaining structure broadens, the union
is faced with representing a more eterogeneous work force,

This can make it more

difficult for the union to obtain a consensus on priorities in bargaining and more
difficult for the union to maintain cohesiveness during economic strikes.

III. Recent Empirical Evidence

on the Market Structure Iypothesis.

The two most comprehensive empirical studies of the relation between market
structure, bargaining structure, and union wages are Hendricks (1975) and Mishel
(1986).

g0th studies use disaggregate data and control for a variety of measures of

the level and structure of unionism,

Contracts were included in the analysis if the contract

listed the wages for specific occupational groups. The sample period is from 1970 to
1971.

Employee Compensation (EEC) Surveys.

at least 50% of the workers were unionized. The wage data consist of the average

that increasing the level of concentration

(holding constant the level of union coverage) raises wages only when a high level of

With both moderate and low coverage levels the interaction is

negative as found in previous aggregate studies.

This provides supports for Rees'

criticism that concentration per se need not lead to higher wages. Mishel finds that
the composition of coverage is important as well as the level of coverage.
Controlling for overall coverage, increasing the share of the dominant union leads to
higher wages.

Similar results were found when the Herfindahl index was substituted

for the dominant union share.

the claim that competitive

In

Hishel finds that wages increase in general with centralization. Mishel

also finds that union workers receive higher wages in more concentrated product
markets regardless of the type of bargaining structure in place.
Interpretation of these empirical findings regarding the effects of bargaining
structures on wage outcomes is made difficult by the fact that bargaining structures
are both an outcome of the bargaining process as well as a determinant of the
bargaining process, Unions and firms may value particular bargaining structures
independent of their effect on future wage settlements. For example,
structures provide scale economies

more centralized

in the costs of contract negotiation and

administration while decentralized structures provide more local autonomy.

The wage

effects discussed above could be interpreted as compensating differentials for
different bargaining structures.
A few empirical studies have examined the role of bargaining structures as
outcomes of the bargaining process.

Deaton and Beaumont (1980) examine the

determinants of bargaining structure using British data while Hendricks and Kahn
(1982) use U.S. data.

Several of the variables used in our wage specifications (j,.,.

sales concentration) were found to be important predictors of bargaining structure.
This may make it difficult for the data precisely to determine independent effects of
bargaining structure and variables such as sales concentration on wages.

However,

there is no necessary statistical bias in the coefficient estimates themselves.
The situation that would lead to statistical bias occurs when the error in the
wage (or strike) equation is correlated with the bargaining structure variables.
example,

For

if "strong" unions (or firms) can negotiate both their desired bargaining

structure and more favorable compensation terms, then our bargaining structure
coefficients would no longer measure the independent effect of bargaining structure on
wages.

Correcting for this excluded variable bias would require using predicted

15
rather than actual measures of the bargaining structure. However, there seems to be
no proclivity as to which direction this bias would take.

Livernash (1963) writes 'On

the other hand, single-employer bargaining may prevail because of union inability to
organize the total product market.

Inability to organize has in recent years

essentially destroyed both multiemployer bargaining and unionism in hoisery and
textiles.

Single-employer bargaining also exista as a deliberate union choice were

pattern-setting and -following tdd to union strength in negotiating with a relatively
small number of large employers.

Single-employerbargaining thus appears both as a

sign of union weakness (inability to organize)

and as a sign of union strength" (p.

13).

Given that there is no definite direction of the potential bias, we will follow
the previous empirical literature and include actual rather than predicted measures

IV. Introducing Strikes into the Market Str'.icture

Hypothesis

The final problem to consider before the empirical analysis is the role of
strikes in the market structure hypothesis. Modern strike models rely on an
information asymmetry or signalling structure in order to accommodate disputes as part
of an economically rational bargaining process.9 To model the implications of the
market structure hypothesis for strikes we consider a very simple asymmetric
information model in which the employer has perfect information about quasi-rents per
worker,

which are defined as the difference between net revenues and the alternative

wage rate of union labor, but the union only knows the distribution of these
quasi-rents. In the appendix we derive the implications of a single round bargaining

constant,

increases

the wage settlement (the optimal offer increases) and increases

the strike probability (the higher offer is less likely to be accepted by the firm).
Finally,

increasing the alternative wage rate, holding the distribution of net

revenues constant,

increases wage settlements and strike probabilities (because labor

market opportunities outside of the bargaining unit are better).

All of the arguments in the literature suggest that increased sales

concentration is intended as a proxy for increased quasi-rents per worker.

This

implies that increases in sales concentration should be associated with incressed wage
settlements and decreased strike incidence.

The arguments in the literature also

suggest that the increased product market coverage by the union is associated with an
increased opportunity cost of time for the members of the bargaining unit.

This

implies that increases in product market coverage by the union involved in the
negotiation should be associated with increasedwage settlements and increased strike

10Quasi-rents, in this model, are defined as the difference between
revenues net of all variable costs except labor and labor costs evaluated at
the alternative wage rate. Therefore, quasi-rents per worker are uncertain
from the union viewpoint (because of the uncertainty about net revenues per
worker) but are fully known from the firm viewpoint. When the alternative
wage rate is held constant, varietion in the parsmetric distribution of net

both the wage settlement and strike probability equations may be interpreted as

only apply to the first category of nonunion workers,

the composition of the nonunion

Nishel (1986) proxied the degree of industrial competitiveness with the percent

of the industry workers organized by the

largest union.

overall coverage into a union-specific and a general component, we will use a
Herfindahl index of union coverage to proxy for the degree of fragmentation. In
addition,

we also include a variable that measures the relative weight that a

particular industry has in the distribution of a union's overall membership.
Specifically, we control for the percent of the union's total membership that is
organized in the industry in question.

coverage constant, we expect that unions exert more influence in their primary

An alternative specification is to code an indicator variable for the case when the
contract-specific structure is the same as the dominant structure observed in the
industry.

If the dominant structure reflects the most appropriate structure for that

industry,

then there may be gains to a union from being able to adopt that particular

structure in its bargaining.

VI. Empirical Results for Strike Activity

manufacturing industries over the period 1970 to 1980.

We model the incidence rate of

studies,

Workers in industries where a large percentage of the unionized workers are

inclusion of unrestricted industry effects substantially reduces the estimated
magnitude. Workers in industries where a large percentage of the unionized workers

This is because at low levels of sales concentration the marginal

decrease strike probabilities. This configuration of results is only consistent with

At high levels of sales concentration the

VIII. Conclusions

How important ia the market structure hypothesis for explaining strike and wage
settlement outcomes?

Our statistical analysis baa ahown that over the decade of the

1970's (late 1970's for wage settlements) trade-adjusted increases

in the four firm

sales ooncentration ratio were associated with higher wage settlements at low sales
concentration levels, lower wage settlements at high sales concentration levela, and
lower strike probabilities at all sales concentration levels.

These results are

inconsistent with the original market structure hypothesis. However,
asymmetric

strike probabilities suggests

reasons that industrial organization theorists have advanced to suggest that this

33
explanation La at least plausible. Of course, a direct estimate of the relation
between quasi-rents per worker and trade-adjuated sales concentration could offer a
more complete explanation.
Trade-adjusted coverage by the union involved in the negotiation fares
considerably better.

This variable is always positively related to both wage

settlements and strike probabilities. This result was predicted by the industrial
relations theorists and is consistent with the economic interpretation the increased
product market coverage by the union increases the alternative wage rate faced by that
union's workers

Appendix

Al.

A Simple Asymmetric Information Model

of Wages and Strikes

In this appendix we present a simple one-period bargaining model that illustrates
the effect

of a set of variables on strike and wage

outcomes,

For simplicity we

assume that negotiations consist of a single 'take-it-or-leave-it'wage demand by the
union.

If the firm rejects the union wage demand, then the bargaining pair dissolves

and the quasi-rents associated with the pair are lost.

That is, the firm receives a

competitive return on its capital while the union receives the alternative wage for
its labor services,

At

We assume that the union enters into bargaining with

the belief that the firm's

profitability is uniformly distributed over the interval from P1 to h'

P —

U[P1,

What is the union's optimal wage demand? Assuming that the union is
risk-neutral, then, it is straight forward to write down the union's decision problem.
Faced with any wage demand W, the firm's optimal response given the one-round nature
of the bargaining is to accept W if W is less than or equal to P and to reject
otherwise. Given the union's prior beliefs about F, the expected value from any
contract demand W is given by

then, the optimal wage demand can be rewritten as

W

+ 1/2 Q

That is, the union demands a contract wage which is equal to the alternative wage plus
a fifty percent share of the maximum potential wage.

This implies that the union's

share of the actual rent will exceed fifty percent if it successfully negotiates a
contract with the firm.
Define the probability of a strike as the probability that the firm rejects the
union's

wage demand.

This probsbility can be expressed in terms of the parameters of

the bargaining model by substituting for the union's optimel wage demand.

All. Summary Statistics for Bargaining Structure Variables
Some descriptive information concerning the distribution of bargaining structures
is presented in Tables Al through A3.

In Table I

shows

the percent of union workers

in manufacturing who were covered by each type of bargaining structure. Separate
figures are given for the years from 1970 to 1950.

Industry/Area agreements acccunt

for the smallest proportion of workers although bargaining units using this structure
are large in size.

Comparing across years shows that there was a decline in the use

of plant level bargaining in the early to mid-seventies although this type of
structure regained its lost market share by l9gO.

Table A2 shows the distribution of

bargaining structures by two-digit industry classification. The figures reflect the
overall average for the industry over the sample period.
exist.

Distinct industry patterns

For example, while Asaociation agreements are the least used type of structure

in general,

they are the dominant structure used in Food, Apparel,

and Printing.

The

Chemical industry is atypical On its heavy use of Plant level bargaining. Because of
the panel structure of our contract data, we can detect bargaining units that changed

41
their bargaining structure during our sample period.

In total, 21.8% of our

bargaining units changed structures. The three industries with the least stability
were Instruments (36.7%),

Petroleum (34.3%), and Rubber (34.4%).

The three industries

with the moat stability were Apparel (10.9%), Stone, Clay, and Glass (12.7%),
Printing (13.2%).

and

Table A3 shows the empirical transition matrix among the types of

bargaining structures. Centralized bargaining structures displayed the most stability
over the period. There was very little movement between Single Company structures and
more centralized structures. Most of the switches occurred between Single Plant and
Multiple Plant structures.

Note: (a) The remaining variables in all models are identical to the ones used in Table 6.
(b) The equations were estimated using weighted least squates with weights proportionaL
to the size sf the bargaining unit. Standard errors (in parentheses) have been
corrected for the hetetosced.aaticity induced by the weighting.
(c) The standard error of the equation and the adjusted R-squared are based on
conventional least squares formulas.
