Inflation and the EMS

Abstract
Since the European Monetary System was instituted in March 1979, there

has been a dramatic reduction in the inflation rates of member countries.
This development

is widely attributed to the EMS

itself.

The purpose of this

basis for such a claim
paper is to argue that the theoretical and empirical
is far from conclusive.
On the theoretical side, the paper develops a model which highlights two
issues.

First, changes in the 'rules" of the exchange rate system need not

coincide with changes in expectations about Central Bank behavior.
expectations

in France do not seem to have changed until policy makers "got

tough" in 1982-83.

In fact,

Second, different researchers have made quite different

about exactly what "rules"

the

EMS imposes.

The paper shows that

how the system works matters in terms of the effect joining will have on
inflation.

On the empirical side, the paper shows that effects which have been
attributed to the EMS

are

in large part due to the global deflation since

1979 and to the fact that EMS members had relatively

Introduction
In 1978, the year before the European Monetary Syatem (EMS) waa

inatituted,

By the end

of 1986, average EMS inflation had fallen to 2.4%, and the range had narrowed
considerably:

-0.2% in Germany and 5.9% in Italy.

developments suggests what I will call the "EMS-Inflation

This approach does allow us to ask whether, ceteris parabus, joining the

To solve the model, each country's inflation must be solved for in terms
of outputs. This is easily done in two steps.

As usual, the real exchange rate depends on differences in the policies of

The second step is to solve for inflation using equations (5), (6) and

and whether Germany and other members are treated

syr.metrically or asymetrically.

Many authors assume both non-cooperative behavior and assymetry by
depicting Germany aa the "leader". For example, Fischer (1987, p. 41) says
that "the EMS can be viewed as an agreement by France and Italy to accept

German leadership in monetary policy, imposing constraints on domestic
monetary and fiscal policies."
There are two different formulations of German leadership.

the second is a game in

which one player (Germany) selects a quantity while the other selects a price
(the exchange rate).

It is a well known result from game theory that, in

most cases, the outcome of a game depends on whether the instruments are
prices or quantities.
Melitz (1985) takes the opposite tack,

He assumes that EMS policy

making is cooperative and treats the members symmetrically.

Roubini

(1987)

and Oudiz (1985) both condsider cooperation as one of many alternative views
of the EMS.
Finally, countries may act symmetrically, but noncooperatively.

Instead, I make two observations.

and Giovannini (198?) and Roubini (1987) argue that Germany has conrir,ued to
sterilize the impact of foreign exchange interventions on the domestic mousy
supply.

As they point out, assymmetric sterilization can turn a systam with

symmetric rules for intervention into an assymmetric system.
The second is that none of these regimes is likely to do a good job over

In both of these regimes, a reduction in the initial inflation

This discussion provides one explanation for the original doubts but

During the first few years

of the EMS, there was little empirical evidenoe supporting the view that
joining had fostered convergence.

It was not until perceptions of government

attributed it to the EMS.
