When a future reversal of the liberalization

deficit on the current account (Calvo, 1986; see also van Wijnbergen, 1985).

problem for the

government: its optimal ex-post strategy may differ from its optimal ex-ante
strategy.

For example, once the private sector sets wages and prices, the

authorities may find it tempting to disinflate less than they had promised in
order to get some output gains (Barro and Cordon, 1983).

Similar temptations

to "surprise" the private sector may exist with trade policy as well (see
Staiger and Tabellini, 1987).

The framework I will consider is one in which the private sector is

unable to distinguish between a govemnment intent on trade reform end one

which simply feigns interest in reform because this is a precondition for
direly needed foreign aid.

The general message that will come acroee is that

the rate at which the reform is introduced may serve to convey the

Note

credible policy reform will requite going overboard: the
govetnment will have to go much further than it would have chosen to in the
absence of the credibility problem. In the case considered here, the reformspecifically,

provides a solution to the

credibility problem in that the reformist government's nemesis would never
find it advantageous to go as far.

Signaling in this faahion is of course

costly, and its ultimate desirability will depend on a number of factors.
But, and this is the key point, achieving credibility will always require a

igrggr policy reform than would have been dictated in the absence of the
credibility problem.2

trade reforms are more likely to be successful when they are undertaken

recent review of 37 liberalization episodes in 19 tountries concludes that
"the likelihood of survival of a liberelization atterpt is substantially
higher where the initial policy measures undertsken are major and significant:
halting or hesitating policy sctions leading to s very gradual liberalization
are much more likely to cause a collapse. This is particularly true in
instances of countries (characteristic of most of Latin America) in which the
history restrictions on trade is long and pervasive" (Papageorgiou, Michaely

of either capital-account restrictions or credit rationing abroad, capital
