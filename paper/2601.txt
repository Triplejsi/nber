VERTICAL RESTRIANTS

Abstract
This paper examines the rationale for vertical restraints.

Such arrangements are shown to increase consumer

effects

The

The following assumptions
are more precisely presented
and discussed in Rey-Stiglitz [19851.
The two main assumptions
are the asymmetry in information between retailers and producers
about retail prices and sales, and the fact that all contracts
are common knowledge. The first assumption may be justified in
several ways, including moral hazard aspects on the retail side
The assumption that the retailers

Similar effects are present in the context analyzed by
Bonannon-Vickers l987]. Two situations are there compared:
the
first one corresponds to what we called "direct competition"
between producers; in the second one, each producer delegates to
a single agent the distribution of his good.
Formally, the first
situation is similar to the situation where each product is
distributed via perfectly competitive retailers, while the second
situation (delegation) corresponds to exclusive territories in
our framework.
