Given the existing debt, the primary surpluses projected for the future
and the projected future interest rates, expressions such as (13), or

(13') or (13") in footnote 16] can be used to assess the consistency of the
external debt strategy. If, under current policy projections, equation
(13) is violated (specifically if the left—hand side exceeds the
right—handside) this doesn't mean that default is inevitable, only that
the strategy under consideration won't work. What will "give" to achieve
equality in (13) is what the debate during the current debt crisis is all
about,
