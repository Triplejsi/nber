THE CHOICE OF MONETARY fl"STRLMNTIN TWO
INTERDEPENDENT ECONOS LNDER LNCERTAINTY

Abstract
This paper analyzes the choice of monetary instrument in

a stochastic two country setting

where each country's set of monetary policy instruments includes both the money supply and the
interest rate, It shows how the optimal choice of instrument is determined in two stages. First, for
each pair, the minimum welfare cost for each economy is determined. This defines a pair of payoff

matrices and the second stage involves determining the Nash equilibrium for this bimatrix game.
In our illustrative example for the alternative shocks considered, a dominant Nash equilibriumis
always obtained.

INTRODtCTION

The question of the optimal choice of monetary instrument was First introced nto:ae
macrostabilization literature by Poole (1970) and has been extensively discussed since, The ey
conclusioh is

that in a

world

of uncertainty, the superiority of the

money stock or Interest rate

as the operating target depends upon the sources of the stochastic disturbances impnging on the
economy.
A crucial assumption underlying this literature is the presence of only a single policy maker.
and much of the derivative work, deals with a closed economy, in which
Poole's

original analysis,

this assumption is the obvious one.

Likewise, the international extensions are typically to small

of his actions on the rest
open economies, in which the policy maker can ignore the repercussions
of the world. However, much of the recent work in international monetary policy stresses the in-

creasing interdependence between econorrues and policy making. Disturbances and policy actions
occurring in one country exert influences abroad, thereby inducing policy reactions. which in turn
feed back on

the first economy. Monetary

policy therefore involves important strategic consid-

erations. Beginning with early work by Hamada (1976), more recent authors such as Carizoneri
and Gray (1985) and others have analyzed strategic monetary policy under alternative behavioral
assumptions.
The present paper analyzes the choice of monetary instrument in a stochastic two—country
setting. As will become evident, the nature of the monetary instrument in a two country environment is of second order of dimensionality. Specifically, each country's set of policy instruments
includes both the money supply and the interest rate. The monetary instrument problem therefore involves assessing welfares in situations where the monetary authorities choose to set dl1erent
policy instruments, as well as in cases where the same instrument is selected. These various combinations of instrument choice give rise to a pair of 2 x 2 payoff matrices in welfare costs and we treat
the monetary instrument problem as being to determine the equilibrium outcome to this bimatrix

game.

used. SpeciOcally. we consider

two identical economies, each producing a common traded good and trading a single common bond.

Purchasing power parity (PPP) and uncovered interest parity are therefore assumed to hold. In
deviation form, the model is expressed by the following equations:

Domestic variables are unstarred; foreign variables are denoted with asterisks,

Equation (1) describes purchasing power parity assumed to hold between domestic and foreign
goods. Equation (2) describesequilibriumin the world goods market, where worlddemand depends

upon world output, the real interest rates in the two economies, and the stochastic disturbance
in demand, The money market equilibrium conditions n the two countries are standard and
described by (3) and (3') respectively. The perfect substitutability between domest,c and foreign
bonds is described by the interest parity condition (4). Finally, equations 5} and (5') describe
outputs in the two economies in terms of standard Lucas 5UPiY functions: the dev:ation n output
from its natural rate is postulated to be a positive function of the unanticipated movement in
the price of output, together with the stochastic disturbance in supply. The stochastic variables,

Ut,V,Wt,W, are assumed to be independently distributed with zero means and finite variances,
etc. If, in addition, as in fact turns out to be the case, the optimal choices of
policy instruments are fixed over time, then, as is well known, the rational expectations solution to

denoted by

the system (1)

(5) implies that expectations for all future periods are constant, With the system

specified in deviation form, this constant is zero, so that

= ((P÷1) = e,(E,) = 0.

(6)

Equations (1) - (6) describe the structureof the two economies. The policy makers in these
economies are assumed to take as benchmarks, the level of output in a frictonless economy, one
where wages and prices are fully flexible and the labor market clears, As is shown in the Appendix,
assuming that labor is immobile internationally, the output in such an economy, responds only to
its own SUPPlY shocks. In terms of the present notation this adjustment can be expressed as

=kw —kw
where

kw (1+n)
1+ n+-i

(7)

n is the elasticity of supply of labor. The level of output fluctuates less than proportionately

with the supply disturbance. Thus the respective objective functions of the two policy makers are
taken to be to minimize?

E(Y,

(8')
These objective functions are assumed to be optimized through monetary policy. whioh we
assum.e can be conducted either by controlling

the money supplies or

by eetting the interest rates.4

Our concern is to compare the alternativeapproaches and to determine the cature of the "mcnetary
instrument" prnblem confronting policy makers within a strategic cotsxt. To do this requires us

to obtain alternative reduced form solutions,appropriate for each chcseo combinationof mcretary
instruments.

a detalled discussion of these reduced formc. which in any event are

straightfoard. However,severalobservationsare worth making. First, the impacts of exogenous
shocks on the two economies depend upon the chosen monetary policy choice, Secondly, in the
two cases of identical instrument choice, the symmetryof the underlying economies is re6ected in

the symmetry of the reduced form solutions. The cross country effects of policy on outputs are
negative. This is the "negative transmission" mechanism dating back to Mundell (1963) and which
under PPP is at its most potent. Essentially, a monetary expansion abroad say. leads to a nominal
depreciation of the foreign currency, ic, and appreciation of the domestic currency. This in turn
leads to a decline in the domestic price level, as PFP is restored, leeding to a reduction in domestic
output. Finally, with asymmetric choice of instruments, this symmetry is lost.
3.

DETERMrATION OF STRATEGIC EQUILIBRIA

We now determinethe strategic equilibriumunder alternative assumptions regarding the choice

of monetary

policy instrument. We do so under the assumption of Cournot behavior, in which

each policy maker takes the behavior of his rival as given, and we allow for both the money supply
and the interest rate to serve as (alternative) policy instruments. Rather than discussing each case
in turn, the general approach is outlined.

First, substitute for Y5 and Y from the reduced forms and for the frictionless output levels
from (7) into the welfare functions (8), (8'). Taking expected values, in general these are
seen to be quadratic functions of the form

6

(i,i,o)

(12)

= (i,i,o')

(12')

=

where

u denotes the vector of variances and covariances of the stochasticdisturbances, Henceforth

time subscripts are dropped and

i,i, index the choice of policy instruments in the domestic and

foreign economies, respectively. Specifically,

i = M, I, and i = M, 1, giving rise to the four

possible combinations of instrument choice.

The optimality conditionsare obtained by minimizing (12) with respect to i, (12') with respect
to

i Under the assumption of Cournot behavior, this yields

äi

'ai•'

r13

Given the quadratic welfare functions, these equations are linear in the policy instruments and
define each country's reaction function, the slopes of which depend upon the policy choice. In a1
cases, since the random variables are independently distributed over time, the optimum calls for

setting = 1 = O(i = M,I;i = M',1). Substituting these values back into (12), (12') yields the
minimized welfare costs under the different regimes.
4. CHOICE OF MONETARY INSTRUMENT
Table 1 summarizesthe minimized welfarecosts under the alternative instrument combinations
in the form of a 2 x 2 payoff matrix for each country. The three parts of this table summarize the
effects of: (i) monetary; (ii) real demand; and (iii) supply disturbances, each taken in turn. In all
cases unit variances are assumed. The optimal choice of monetary instrument is defined to be the
Nash equilibrium to this bimatrix game, in the sense that neither policy maker has an incentive
to switch unilaterally from this point.5 The three disturbances shall be discussed in turn.
A. Monetary Disturbances

instrument combinations represent Nash equilibria. Moreover, both are

admissible in the sense that neither is dominated by the other. in terms of welfare costs.
With a perfectly correlated worldwide monetary disturbance, it

is

clear that the

I— P

in-

strument oombination is a Nash equilibrium, since both countries allow their respective money
supplies to absorb their monetary shocks, thereby perfectly insulating the output levels in the two
economies. This is a direct analogue of Poole. It is clear that neither the M —

P combination nor

the P — M combination can be a Nash equilibrium, since in either osse the policy noaker controllIng the money supply can be made better off by switching to setting the interest rate. But it ie

have an incentive to switch unilaterally to setting the money supply. The intuition is the same as
in Poole. By controlling the money supply, the monetary authority allows some of the fluctuations

fact, either inequality in (14) may hold, dependingupon parameter values. For example, suppose

= .75,d .5,a = 1,cs = .5,' = 1 are taken as reasonable values
implying a.,,, = .573,e, =
807. In this case, the M — M" combination is chosen if and only if k < .69, i.e., if and only if
the elasticity of supply of labor n < 1.23; otherwise, the domestic authorities choose to set the
interest rate, in which case the Nash equilibrium is the I — M policy combination. The
to
key

the choice here is which policy regime "tracks" the frictionless output level better. With n
large,
the frictionless output is more sensitive to domestic supply shocks. For this
particular parameter
set this is more closely followed by setting I, but this is not true in all cases.
Finally, C(ii) summarizes the welfare costs for worldwide supply disturbances. In this case one
can establish that both the M—M and the I—I" policy combinations are Nash
equilibria in that
starting from either, neither policy maker has an incentive to deviate unilaterally. However, one
of the two equilibria can always be shown to be superior. Which one it is, depends
critically upon

f

parameter values. For the above set, M — M is superior for n < .538, while I — dominates
for n > .538. Since both policy makers have symmetric welfare costs in this
case, there is no
potential conflict in the choice of these two Nash equilibria. But it is possible for the inferior
Nash equilibriumto be chosen and for the policy makers to be unable to coordinate their actions

to attain the dominant outcome. In this case, some form of communication between the

tThis is similar to Hamada's (1979) approach to deterrn.ning.nernalional monetary arraogements as a two—stage game. In the first stage the rules are set; ifl the second, the pOcies are
determined for the chosen set of rules.
2For examples

of such models see some of the papers in Bhandari (l985.

3The objective functions (8), (8') are well known to have desirabie welfare properties: see e.g
A.izenrnan and Frenkel (1985)

4Our analysis follows the usual monetary instrument terature by restrIcting the choe oZ
alternative monetary instruments to the money stock and the interest rate. This restrict.on IS
somewhat arbitrary, since the monetary authorities can choose to control other aggregates as weli.
There are also other ways of conducting monetary policy such as adustng the money stock to

the price Level. While this would be optimal in the face of aggregate demand shocks u anc
monetary shocks v,v, it would be an inappropriate policy for dealing with supply shocks. In any
extended range of monetary
event, the approach of this paper can be adapted to analyzing an
peg

policy instruments.

tOne minor point is the familiar observation that under rational expectations, pegg1ng the
interest rate leads to an indeterminate mean price level, This is not serious, since the analysis
focuses on deviations about equilibrium. Furthermore, the indeterminacy can be resolved by
simultaneously setting a corresponding mean level for the money supply
