THE DEBT CRISIS: STRUCTURAL
EXPLANATIONS OF COUNTRY PERFORMANCE

ABSTRACT

This paper develops a cross-country statistical model of debt rescheduling,
and

the secondary market valuation of LDC debt, which links these variables
to key structural characteristics of developing countries, such as the trade
regime, the degree of income inequality, and the share of agriculture in CNP.
Our most striking finding is that higher income inequality is a significant
predictor of a-higher probability of debt rescheduling in a cross-section of
middle-income countries. We attribute this correlation to various
difficulties of political management in economies with extreme inequality.
We also find that outward-orientation of the trade regime is a significant
predictor of a reduced probability of debt rescheduling.

Introduction

The debt crisis can be studied as a problem in epidemiology. A
powerful virus, high world interest rates, hit the population of capital-

importing developing countries in the early l9BOs. Some countries succumbed
to the virus, having to reschedule their debts on an emergency basis, while

others did not. And of those countries that arrived for emergency
treatment, some recovered sufficiently to enter a period of quiet
convalescence, while others are still suffering from febrile seizures in the
ElF's intensive care unit.

The epidemiologist studies the progression of a disease in order to
understand the disease better, and to recommend improved forms of treatment.

For the same reason, it is important to understand why some countries fell
prey to the debt crisis while others did not, and why some countries have
recovered from the crisis while other countries remain deeply enmeshed in

it. The goal of our paper is to find answers to these questions, and then
to draw inferences about the fundamental nature of the debt crisis itself.

Was the crisis mainly the result of external shocks, internal policy
mistakes, the organization of political power within the debtor countries,
or other structural features of those economies that succumbed to crisis?
Several earlier studies (e.g. Cline, 1984; McFadden, et. al. ,

1985)

have tried to identify the proximate causes of the debt crisis by estimating
a probability model of rescheduling for a cross-section of debtor countries.

Typically, such studies try to explain the crisis by looking mainly at the
cross-country variation of a set of financial variables, such as the ratio

of

debt service to exports,

the ratio of foreign exchange reserves to

imports, and so forth. These studies are problematical, however, since many
of the supposedly "causal" variables (e.g. low foreign exchange reserves)

are really symptoms of the crisis rather than fundamental causes. Moreover,
learn little about the kinds of policies or structural conditions within an
economy that lead to the adverse changes in the financial variables.
Our study seeks to identify causes of the debt crisis that are more
fundamental than the values of financial variables on the eve of

rescheduling. Several earlier studies provide us with the foundation for

such an analysis. Ealassa (1982), Sachs (1985), and many others, for -

example, have shown that the forej2n trade regime in each country is an
extremely important determinant of which countries succumbed to the debt

crisis, and which ones did not. The accumulated evidence is clear that
outward-oriented trade policies, such as those pursued in East Asia, have
been successful in raising the share of exports in national production,
spurring overall growth, and providing the foreign exchange earnings to
service foreign debts without reschedulings in the 1980s.

Other studies such as those in the NEER Study on Foreign Debt (edited
by Sachs, 1988) stress the political prerequisites for avoiding a debt

crisis, and for recovering from such a crisis after it begins. It appears
that in many developing countries, the reliance of a government on heavy
foreign borrowing of the l97Os was determined by the political needs of the
incumbent government, rather than by calculations of intertemporal economic

efficiency. Foreign borrowing was, in many cases, a way for governments to
satisfy intense social demands for higher government spending without having
to suffer (in the short-term) the political consequences of higher tax

2

collections or the inflationary consequences of money-financed deficits)
In our view, the political pressures for excessive foreign borrowing
tend to be wore acute in economies with extreme inequalities of income. In
such economies, the pressures for redistributive policies tend to be
greatest, while the ability of the wealthy to resist the pressures for
income redistribution also tend to be strong given their significant command

over economic and political resources in the country. Competing interest
groups tend to see very little commonality of interests given the wide
disparities in income, and the economic policies that resqlt from this

distributional tug-of-war may tend to be short-sighted and to oscillate
widely over time. In many Latin American countries, for example, urban
workers support populist regimes, while landowners and other economic elites

often support highly repressive governments that promise to suppress worker
demands. Policies vary significantly as these groups alternate in political
power,

Another key dimension of the political system is the extent to which
agricultural versus urban interests influence the political decisions over

economic policymaking. Huntington (1968) and other political scientists
1

Note that while the social pressures leading to overborrowing were
probably around for many years before the debt crisis, the manifestation of
those pressures in the form of heavy foreign debt had to await the dramatic
rise in the willingness of commercial banks to engage in cross-border
sovereign lending in the l970s. The sudden rise in international commercial
bank lending no doubt reflected other structural changes in the world
economy, such as: expansionary U.S. monetary policies in the early l970s,
the breakdown of the fixed exchange rate system and the sharp rise in global
liquidity attendant upon the collapse of the system, the OPEC oil price
increases in 1973-74 and the consequent growth of "petrodollar recycling",
the dimming of bankers' memories of the defaults on sovereign loans in the
Great Depression. Moreover, without the sharp and remarkable rise in world
interest rates in the early 1980s, the heavy lending to the developing world
could well have continued without overt crisis for many more years.

have stressed that itt the case of developing countries, urban politics tends

to be a cauldron of instability and populist policies. Governments are most
secure which find a significant base of support in the agricultural sector,
which tends to favor more conservative and stable policies.

In Huntington's

words:

In modernizing countries the city is not only the locus of
instability; it is also the center of opposition to the
government. If a government is to enjoy a modicum of
stability, it requires substantial rural backing. If no
government can win the support of the countryside, there is
no possibility of stability. (p.435)
-

In

some instances, urban revolts may overturn rural-based
governments, but in general governments which are strong in
the countryside are able to withstand, if not to reducs or
eliminate, the continuing opposition they confront in the
cities.
(p. 437)

These considerations lead us to expect that the structural importance of
agriculture in the economy, which we measure roughly as the share of
agriculture in GNP, will help to predict the extent of political stability,
and by extension, the proneness of countries to an external debt crisis.

Several other variables have been mentioned by observers of the debt
crisis as possible structural factors which may raise or lower the
probability of debt crisis in a particular country.

Possible explanatory

variables include: movements in the terms of trade; the structure of foreign
trade (e.g. the share of manufacturing goods versus primary products in
total exports, and the extent of the commodity diversification of exports);

the level of per capita income in the country; and the geographical location
of the country, especially if there are regional "contagion effects" in
commercial bank lending.
Thie size of the debt burden (e.g. the debt-export ratio) at the time

4

of the rise in real interest rates in the early 1980s helps to explain the
effect of the debt crisis in the various countries.

tie expect that our

structural variables should help to explain the debt-export ratios of the
individual countries (e.g. more unequal countries will have a higher

expected debt-export ratio). We also expect indecendent effects of our
structural variables, after controlling for the debt-export ratio, since the
structural variables should help to account for how much of any given amount
of debt was acquired on grounds of intertemporal optimality, and also how
effectively the country was able to respond to the rise in world interest
rates.

Our strategy in this paper is to develop a basic statistical model of
debt rescheduling, that links reschedulings to key structural
characteristics of developing countries: trade regime, income inequality,

share of agriculture in production, etc. In Section II of the paper, we
introduce the basic statistical models and the key explanatory variables.

In Section III we present the empirical estimates of the basic models. In
Section IV we explore the robustness of the statistical results by
considering additional candidate variables in the key regression equations.
In Section V, we discuss the implications of our findings for the

understanding of the debt crisis, for the choice of policies in the debtor
coutries, and for future research on the political economy of stabilization
in the developing countries.

II. Structural Factors in Debt Reschedulings: A Probability Model

Several earlier studies, including Callier (1985), dine (1984), Feder
and Just (1977), and McFadden et. al. (1985), have developed probability
S

models of debt reschedulings. From these studies we learn that debt
reschedulings tend to occur when governments have heavy external debts and a

shortage of foreign exchange reserves. The equations usually tell us little
about the kinds of countries that are likely to arrive at that unpleasant
condition. The study by Callier is a partial exception to this statement,
since in addition to the usual financial indicators he considers some
"structural' variables in the debtor countries, including population,
investment rates, and openness to trade.

Consider Cline's (1984) influential study of debt reschedulings. dine
estimates a logit model on a time-series, cross-section of developing

countries during 1972-1983. In terms of country-specific variables, dine
demonstrates that the probability of debt rescheduling in year t is a
function of the following variables in year t-1 (with the sign indicated in
parentheses): the country's current account deficit (s-), the debt serviceexport ratio (+),

the

ratio of foreign reserves to imports (-),

ratio of net debt to exports (+) .

and the

Other structural variables that Cline

includes in his model, such as the economy's growth rate, per capita income
level, and savings rate, turn out to have little explanatory power.

Our approach differs from Cline's treatment by attempting, like
dallier, to relate debt reschedulings to deeper structural characteristics
of the economies, characteristics which change slowly over the course of a
decade and thus can be considered as temporally prior to the financial

distress itself. In general, where the data are available we measure these
structural characteristics during the L97Os (e.g. as an average for 1970-

80), to emphasize that we are looking at country
preceeded the debt crisis itself.

characteristics

that

We develop two basic probability models, the first for the onset of the
debt crisis, and the second for the difficulties of the various countries in

overcoming the crisis. The first model is a standard cross-section probit
model of rescheduling, of the form:

?rob(Ri_l) —

(1)

where Ri is a variable equal to I if country I rescheduled it debt during
1977-85, and equal to Oif there was no rescheduling. The vector Z

includes

-

the economic and political variables in the model. I is the

cumulative

standard normal distribution.

The second model is a tobit model, based on the secondary market value

of the country's debt as of July 1987. The idea is as follows. The
secondary market value of a country's debt can be used as a cardinal measure

of the country's creditworthiness. Countries which have escaped the debt
crisis will have debt that sells at par or very close to par in the
secondary market. Countries enmeshed in the crisis will have debt that
sells at a discount relative to par, with the size of the discount providing
a good indicator of the political and economic incapacity of the country to
service its debt.

A tobit model allows us to test for the factors that determine the size
of the discount on the debt, taking into account the fact that for a range
of creditworthiness, the discount will be zero.

explanatory variables in the model.

Throughout this study, our attention is focussed on commercial
borrowers and commercial bank reschedulings, as defined by the World Bank.

The World Bank and International Monetary Fund define commercial borrowers
as those developing countries for which at least one-third of foreign

borrowing is from private sector creditors. Thus, we restrict our attention
to the subset of developing countries with access to commercial bank lending
during the l970s, and do not analyze the conditions leading to reschedulings

of official debt in the Paris Club. While our sample includes a few low
income countries that did have access to commercial loans (e.g. India, Sri
Lanka, and China) most of the focus is on middle-income developing countries

with per capita incomes above $600 per capita. Even with the restriction to
commercial borrowers, the range of countries is enormous, with per capita

CR in 1981 ranging from $260 in India to $5670 in Trinidad and Tobago.
Our sample is further restricted to countries with a population in
excess of 1 million in 1980, and to countries for which the key income

distributional data are available. The resulting list of countries, with
their rescheduling histories is shown in Table 1. Note that there are 35
countries in the sample, of which 15 have rescheduled with commercial

creditors, In Latin America and the Caribbean, 10 of 12 countries are
reschedulers, with Colombia and trinidad and Tobago the only two

nonreschedulers.2 In East Asia, only 1 in 9 countries, the Philippines, is

Colombia has not rescheduled its principal, but it has lost a measure
of access to new lending on normal market terms. In 1985, it negotiated a
"concerted" loan of $1 billion from the commercial bank creditors, while

rescheduled (Ivory Coast), while two did not (Kenya and Mauritius). In
Europe and North Africa, 2 out of 4 countries rescheduled (Morocco and
Yugoslavia).

We must stress the severe but inevitable problem of working with a

very

small sample. Not only are we restricted to a subset of commercial
borrowers, but our hypothesis testing is limited by the fact that the number

of non-Latin American reschedulers is only 5. Note that all of the
significance tests reported for the probits and tobits are justified

asymptotically. Moreover, it should be recognized that our explanatory
variables are no doubt measured with error (especially the distribution of
household income, and the index of outward orientation).
We now turn to our principal explanatory variables.

A. Trade Regime
There is now a considerable amount of evidence that outwardorientation of trade policy enhances the growth prospects of developing

countries, as well as their capacity to adjust to external shocks. Several
classic studies have addressed the relative merits of outward orientation
versus inward, import-substitution policies, as a strategy of long-ten

development. Virtually all such studies reach the conclusion that outwardorientation has produced superior results in the intermediate

term (see for

example Little, Scitovslq', and Scott (1970), the Bhagwati-Krueger NBER Study

(see Krueger (1978) for a summary of the conclusions), and Balassa (1982).

remaining current on debt servicing obligations. As noted later in the
text, we may interpret Colombia as having had a "mini-debt crisis".
Interestingly, in our probit model, it turns out that Colombia is almost
always estimated to be just on the borderline between rescheduling and non-reschedul
9

More recently, several authors have stressed that outward orientation has
led not only to better growth performance but also an enhanced ability to

adjust to external shocks, including the debt crisis of the l980s. Balassa
(1984) and Sachs (1985) give evidence in support of such a conclusion.
It should be stressed that outward orientation refers to the relative
incentives given to the production of exportables versus importables (with a
zero bias or a pro-export bias both considered to be outward oriented), and

na to

the extent to which the trade regime is laissez faire. As argued by

many authors, e.g. Bradford (1987), tin (1985), Sachs (1987), several of the

most outward-oriented economies (such as Korea and Taiwan) have hijhly

diriziste governments, with highly regulated trade. The difference of these
countries from the inward-oriented policies elsewhere is that the dirigisme
is directed towards export promotion rather than import-substitition.
There are several linkages between trade orientation and the

probability of debt rescheduling. Most directly, outward-oriented economies
have typically maintained a lower ratio of debt service to exports, because

of the rapid rise of export earnings. Moreover, outward-oriented economies
have tended to maintain exchange rates at levels necessary to maintain
export profitability, given that exporters represent a major interest group

with strong influence on exchange rate policies. These countries therefore
have avoided the political commitments to overvalued exchange rates that
characterized many Latin American economies in the late 1970s and early
l980s (e.g. Mexico and Venezuela during 1980-82), and thus have avoided the

worst excesses of capital flight that were produced by exchange rate
overvaluations.

Our basic measure of outward orientation comes from the World Bank

data are reported in the fourth data•column of table 2. The World Bank
variable divides countries into four categories (strongly outward oriented,
moderately outward oriented, moderately inward oriented, and strongly inward
oriented), and we use this fourfold division as an index ranging from 1

(most inward oriented) to 4. The great advantage of the World Bank measure
over other indicators of the trade regime, such as the growth in exports or
the share of exports in GNP, is that it is based on an assessment of trade
nolicies in the developing countries rather than trade outcomes.

It has two majorprobleuns however. First, it is available for only 24
of the 35 countries in our sample. To handle this we run two set of
regressions: one with the 24 observations, and one with the 35, but

correcting for the missing observations (see details below). The second
problem is one of timing. The variable is constructed for the "average"
policy orientation during 1960-73, which is too early for our analysis, and
for the average during 1973-85, which is a bit too late, since it includes

years after the onset of the debt crisis. After experimenting with both
measures, we have used the later measure despite this timing problem (it
turns out that an average over the two periods produces similar results to
the variable that we use).

We experimented with other outcome-based" measured of the trade
regime, such as the growth of the export-GNP ratio and the excess of the

export-GNP ratio over a predicted value. In general these alternative
measures entered the models with the expected sign but often with much less

explanatory power than did the World tank variable. Their use did not
change the explanatory power of the other included variables. For the sake

Il

of brevity, we do not report the estimates using the alternative measures.

Political Determinants

For many countries, the debt crisis reflects a political crisis as well

as an economic crisis. The political crisis shows up most directly in the
inability or unwillingness of governments to restrain large and chronic

public sector deficits. In some cases, the large deficits reflect a decline
in the legitimacy of a governing party, which attempts to use public
spending to maintain political support and to buy off the opposition for as

long as possible. In some cases, the regime is so narrowly based and so
precarious that it chooses to use the public purse to enrich a small part of

the population, aware that political power may slip away at any time. The
time horizon of fiscal policymaking becomes extremely short, and the
incentives for any particular government in power to balance the budget

become extremely weak. In yet other cases, the political process is
paralyzed, because power is too widely dispersed among various groups who
hold a veto over economic policy, but who cannot coalesce around a
consistent economic program.

Because of data limitations, we cannot directly test for the importance
of fiscal deficits in the debt crisis, since available cross-country data on

budget deficits in developing countries are very poor. Without a detailed
analysis of the fiscal data, as in the country monographs in the NBER Study
on Foreiwn Debt and Economic Performance: the Country Studies, edited by
Sachs (1988b), it is not possible to make a meaningful cross-country
comparison of budget deficits.

More generally, it is also not possible to construct clear direct

12

measures of the political determinants of country performance. In
particular, we are concerned that political weakness and instability come in

many guises. We may observe, for example, continuing political stalemate, a
rapid alternation of governments, the attempt of a ruling group to buy off
the opposition through unsustainable expansionary macroeconomic policies,
political violence, and so forth.

We therefore choose to follow a

'reduced form" strategy, by identifying two structural characteristics in
the economies of the debtor countries that would tend to contribute to
political polarization, inefficient and dynamically inconsistent policies,

and inability to respond effeitively to crises. In other words; we seek to
identify fundamental economic factors that might contribute to instability,
rather than using direct measures of the instability itself as predictors of

debt rescheduling. In a later study, we will attempt to draw the
statistical linkages between our structural "predictors" of policy
ineffectiveness and alternative measures of political stability.

We identify two fundamental characteristics that we believe should be
important for effective political management: the extent of income
inequality, and the division of the economy between agricultural and non-

agricultural sectors. The extent of income inequality should matter in
several distinct ways. Higher income inequality should be expected, all
other things being equal, to:

raise

-

the pressures for redistributive policies among the
poor and working classes;

-

enhance the power of economic elites to resist taxation
to the extent that they command a large share of national
resources;

-

reduce the size of the more taxable income classes;

• decrease the political legitimacy of a governments that

policies that promote development in the long term, but which may
impose costs on some social groups in the short term.
Thus, one of our central hypotheses is that a high degree of income
inequality should be associated with a high probability of rescheduling,
since the income inequality undermines the political stability and political
effectiveness needed for successful macroeconomic management.
Alesina and Tabellini (1987) have presented a formal model showing how
distributional cleavages among competing income classes in a society can

contribute to a debt crisis. In their model, a left-wing labor force
competes with capitalists for political power (the competition may or may

not be via the electoral process). The groups alternate randomly in their

hold on power, and both groups recognize that each governments tenure is
likely to be quite short. When labor is in power, it has an interest in
squeezing the profits of capitalists, while capitalist governments have the
incentive to tax labor heavily.

Whichever group is in power, there is a strong incentive of that

government to borrow up to the lending limit of the forcing banks. This is

14

because the group in power can benefit heavily from an increase in
contemporaneous government spending (financed by foreign funds), while there
is a good chance that the opposing 2roup will be saddled with the debts,

assuming that political power alternates in the future. The shorter is the
expected longevity of the government, the greater is the government's
incentive to over-borrow from abroad (relative to the amount that the
government would borrow were it certain that it would maintain its hold on

government forever). At the same time, the risk of political alternation
induces all residents in the economy to hold their wealth outside of the
country (i.e. to engage in capital flight), and thereby to keep their wealth
beyond the tax collections of the opposing group.

Note that the focus on income distribution as a causal factor in
explaining economic performance reverses the usual focus in the development
literature on explaining income distribution as the result of government

policies and the development process itself. In Adelman and Robinson's
(1987) valuable survey of "Income Distribution and Development", for
example, almost the entire focus is on the effects of growth on income
distribution, rather than the possible effects of income distribution on

growth. They focus on the problem that in the growth process in developing
countries the income distribution tends to become more unequal before it
begins to equalize (as was suggested by Kuznets (1955)), and suggest that
there may be an ethical case for equalizing incomes (e.g. via land reform)

before the growth process begins (a strategy that Adelman has termed
"redistribution before growth", in contrast to "redistribution with
growth").

15

A few authors have adopted the strategy here of reversing the
direction of causality, and attempting to explain economic performance as a

result of the income distribution. Pyo (1986), Sachs (1987), and Williamson
(1987), all suggest that the relatively equal income distribution in East
Asia is an important factor in that region's strong economic performance in

the post-War period. For a broad cross-section of developing countries, Pyo
shows that the Cmi coefficient has a significantly negative effect on
aggregate growth during 1960-80 (i.e. higher inequality is associated with
slower average growth). -

In

our sample of countries it is also true that the
-

average CNP growth rate between 1960 and 1980 is highly and negatively

correlated

with the degree of income inequality.3 Political scientists more

than economists have studied the effects of income distribution on social

outcomes. For a useful survey of the political science literature, and some
empirical results linking income inequality to political violence, see

Sigelman and Simpson (1977).
In many of the countries under study, the adverse effects of high

income inequality on policymaking are readily observable. According to the

We use a measure of inequality the ratio of income of the richest
quintile of households to the poorest quintile of households (we label this
variable RATIO). Then, in a regression of the average growth during 1965-85
on RATIO we find:

Sigelman and Simpson summarize the political science literature up
till 1977 as holding that "antisystem frustrations are apt to be high where
a substantial proportion of the public does not share fully in the
allocation of scarce resources." (p. 106)
16

analysis of Mexico by Buff ie and Sangines in Sachs (1988b), for example,

attempts to contain social conflict during 1970-82 contributed to heavy
government spending with a populist -

redistributive

aim, while at the same

time the government bowed to the objections of the economic elites, and
dropped tax reform measures that might have provided an adequate revenue

base for the increased government spending. The government spending boom
was therefore financed heavily by foreign borrowing and by oil in the late

1970s and early 1980s. This precarious financing base collapsed in 1982.
In Argentina, similar problems (inadequate tax revenues and pressures
for large government spending) have afflicted virtually all governments

since World War II. But the problems are greatly exacerbated relative to
Mexico by the powerful and well-organized Argentine labor movement, which
has resisted real wage cuts and fiscal austerity through direct labor

militancy. As a famous example, the worker riots in Cordoba during 1969
(known as the TMcordobazo") effectively killed the Krieger-Vasena

stabilization program begun under a military government in 1967, and thereby
set the economy on a trajectory of sharply rising deficits and inflation.
That instability continued to worsen for several years, and led to the

return of Juan Peron from exile in 1973, and eventually to a militarycoup
that toppled Peron's wife from power in 1976.

In Brazil, the fears have centered less on labor militancy than on the
potential for direct and destabilizing violence in the favelas of Rio and

Sao Paulo. It is frequently saidof Brazilian governments in the past
fifteen years that they dared not risk a slowdown in the economy because of
the possible consequence of unleashing uncontrollable social conflict, and
because of the concern for protecting the course of redemocratization that

17

has been underway during this period. The government's felt need to
maintain growth at all costs because of the social pressures was a major

contributing factor in Brazil's eventual crisis. Rather than cooling off
the economy in the late l970s, the government kept the economy in high-gear

with heavy foreign borrowing. At a crucial moment in 1979, when Brazil
still had the chance of avoiding crisis by slowing the economy, the
Brazilian finance minister Mario Simonsen was sacked for recommending
austerity, and was replaced by Delfim Netto, whose policies helped to run
the economy straight into its debt crisis.

-

Countries with a low degree of income inequality can likely avoid many
of these policy debacles. Sachs (1987) has suggested, for example, that the
extremely j3 levels of inequality immediately after World War II in Japan,
Korea, and Taiwan, can help to account for the economic success of those
countries, by giving the governments in power the opportunity to focus on

issues of growth rather than redistribution.5 To some extent, the low
levels of inequality were fortuitous outcomes of the political upheavals of

the time. In Japan, the destruction caused by the war, followed by massive
land reform under the U.S. occupation authorities, and the high post-war

inflation, resulted in a profound narrow of income inequalities. In Korea
and Taiwan, the same factors (war, land reform, and high inflation) played a
similar role, as did the decolonization from Japan, which removed a class of
wealthy overlords from the two economies.

Dornbusch and Park(l987) suggest for the Korean case:
"Exactly how income distribution has influenced growth,, other than
by promoting social stability, is open to discussion. But it would
certainly shape the domestic market firms face, it may influence saving
behavior, must influence politics, and may have important implications for
the ease with which the government can shift economic policies."
18

In more recent years, these economies have displayed the capacity to

adjust to external shocks with little public upheaval. At the same time
that Brazil sacked its finance minister in 1979 for urging fiscal restraint,
South Korea embarked on a period of fiscal austerity in response to the

early signs of tightening foreign credit conditions. Between 1980 and 1983,
South Korea reduced its budget deficits (from 3.2 percent of CNP to 1.6
percent of GM?, according to Collins and Park, Table 4 in Sachs(1988b)),
while Brazil's inflation-corrected deficit soared to 15.2 percent of COP in
1983 (see Cardoso and Fishlow, Table 1 in Sachs(19a8b)). We

are fully aware of the fact that a given degree of income inequality

by itself will have quite varying effects on the political order depending

on the political institutions in place in the society. Huntington suggests
that a country with strong political parties may be able to channel the
grievances over income distribution into partisan political conflict, with

little jeopardy to the fundamental political order. Similarly, a country
with competing interests organized by peak associations (e.g. a unified
national labor organization) may be able to incorporate potential opponents
of the regime at relative low cost, and thereby purchase a degree of

political stability. This is the strategy known as neo-corporatism, which
is exemplified in the developed countries by Sweden, and in the developing
countries by Mexico.

In our empirical work, we measure income inequality by taking the ratio
of the income share of the top 20 percent of the households, relative to the

income share of the bottom 20 percent of the households, as reported by the

World Bank and the United Nations (see Table 2 for sources). As seen in the

19

third data column of Table 2, this ratio is unusually high in the Latin
American countries, a point which remains true after controlling for the

level of per capita income. To see this, we follow the idea of the Kuznets
curve and regress, in cross-section data, the income ratio on per capita

GNP, per capita GNP squared and regional dummy variables for Latin America
and for Last Asia. As seen in regression 2 of table 3, the ratio of income
of the top to the bottom 20 percent is significantly higher in Latin America

than in East Asia, The ratio averages 21.1 in Latin America (the per
household income of the rich is 21.1 times greater than the perhousehold
income of the poor), and only 8.7 in East Asia.

We have restricted ourselves to income distribution data which in
principle come from household surveys of the entire population, use a common

unit (the household), and include income from all sources. This variable is
measured with error, of course; we can only hope that the cross-country
variation will dominate measurement error. For a discussion of the sources
and quality of this data, see for example Jain(l975).

A second indicator of political stability that we investigate is the
share of the national production that is located in the agricultural sector,

as reported in the fifth data column in Table 2. The share of agriculture
in production is included to offer a rough indication of the extent to which
governments can derive their political backing from rural interests rather
than urban interests, on the theory that a rural power base tends to be more
stable and more supportive of export-promoting policies.

We have already touched on Huntington0s analysis of the links between a

rural base of power and political instability. Mobilized opposition to the

government tends to be found in the urban centers, where students,
government works, industrial workers, and so on, can be successfully

organized. Not only can these groups threaten the survival of a regime,
they can also apply effective pressure for government spending and low taxes

on the urban population as the price for political peace. There may also be
a direct link between agriculture and trade policy: in most countries
agriculture is a tradeable good that is hurt by an overvalued exchange rate
and by a heavy emphasis on import-substitution policies.
These ideai find initial support in our sample of countries. It is
noteworthy that among the 35 countries that we are considering, the
incidence of violent coups in the 1970s can be partially explained in a
probit model as a negative function of the share of agriculture in CNP
during the decade, controlling for the level of per capita income (higher
income countries, cet. par., showed a smaller probability of a violent

coup).6 To see why this relationship is found, note that of the 15
countries in the sample with a share of agriculture in GNP of 15 percent or
less, 6 countries (40 percent) experienced a violent coup during the 1970s.

21

more, only Thailand (9 percent of the cases) experienced at a violent coup.7
In our view, it is the importance of the rural base of politics that
helps to explain why Colombia is the only commercial borrower in Latin

America to have escaped a debt crisis in the l980s. Colombia's share of
agriculture in GNP averaged 29 percent during 1970-81, which was by far the
highest for the region, and more than twice the overall average for Latin

America and the Carribbean, 12.1 percent of 01W. It has been suggested by
some observers that the heavy political influence of the coffee growers in
Colombia contributed importantly to the government's decision to introduce
the crawling-peg exchange rate in 1967, a policy innovation which has been
instrumental in the past two decades in permitting Colombia to avoid the
worst ravages of currency overvaluation.

Along a similar line, Urritia (in Sachs, 1988a) explains Colombia's
relative fiscal prudence during the l970s according to the unusual structure
of its politics:

Finally, the government in 1974-78 had a large rural base of
support, and the President had developed a strong commitment
to promoting development in the rural sector and dismantling
the import substitution model of development. He was against
subsidizing organized labor and industrialists, was antibureaucracy, and had his urban support among the unorganized
who suffered most from inflation. . . The main objective of
the government in power between 1974 and 1978 was to control
inflation, and with this objective, it carried out a tax
reform in 1974, and also to control inflation, the government
did not increase the foreign debt.
In contrast, in the early eighties, another government, whose
political base was largely the bureaucracy, increased debt
and government expenditure rapidly. That policy created a
mini-debt crisis in 1983-84, but Colombia was the only
country in Latin America that adjusted successfully after

1982. It did it by almost wiping out the fiscal deficit in

are:

increasing taxation.

III. Empirical Implementation of the Probability Model

We now turn to the empirical implementation of the probability models.
We run two basic equations: a probit model that estimates a probability
function for reschedulings with commercial creditors, and a tobit model that
estimates the size of the discounts on borrowing country debt sold in the

secondary markets. For each model, we use twodistiact samples: a sample of
the 24 countries for which the World Bank's outward-orientation variable is
available, and a more inclusive sample of 35 commercial borrowers.

In order to include the outward-orientation variable in the large

sample, we follow a standard procedure (see for example Maddala (1977)). In
a first-stage regression, we regress the outward-orientation measure on the

other right-hand side variables in our sample of 24 countries. Using the
estimated coefficients, we then create a fitted measure of outward
orientation for the 11 missing countries, by applying the regression

coefficients to the right-hand-side values for the 11 countries. The new
synthetic outward orientation variable now has 35 observations, the 24
original observations and 11 fitted values.8
8

This procedure w411 improve the efficiency of estimation in that it
allows us to use a larger sample of data. However the use of the estimated
explanatory variable will introduce heteroskedasticity as well as additional
small sample bias. The net effect is uncertain. Furthermore the tstatistics shown in the paper are calculated as if the estimated values were
the true ones. They should probably be corrected for degrees of freedom,
although of course these tests are only asymptotically valid anyway.
Finally, this procedure is consistent only for linear estimation, since the
expectation of a non-linear function is not equal to the function evaluated
at the expectation of its arguments. However to make a careful correction
23

The basic probit model attempts to explain the pattern of reschedulings
and no reschedulings according to four variables: the income distribution
(ratio of household income of top 20 percentiles over bottom 20 percentiles,

RATIO), outward orientation of policies during 1973-85 (0UT7385), the share
of agriculture in CNP during 1970-81 (Agv7OBl). and the level of per capita
GNP (in $tJ.S.)

in

1981 (CNPcB1). The last variable is included for several

reasons. First, higher-income countries may be less likely to reschedule
than poorer countries since the costs of rescheduling (a loss of access to
new lending on -normal market terms, a partial disruption of normal trade

relations, IMF surveillance, and so forth) would tend to be more onerous for

more advanced economies. Second, the high levels of per capita income may
reflect other characteristics of a country that would tend to reduce the
chances for debt rescheduling, e.g. more effective economic and political
institutions (controlling for income distribution, agricultural share of
CMI', etc.). Third, the other explanatory variables are also known to be a
function of per capita CMI'. It is thus especially important to verify that
income distribution and the agricultural share are not simply proxying for
the level of economic development, but are indeed reflecting a deeper
structural feature of the economy.
In most of the regressions that follow, CMI' per capita is actually
entered as CMI' per capita squared, since some preliminary regressions

indicated that the nonlinear specification slightly improves the performance

of the model. The variable always enters with a negative sign, suggesting

for this problem would require very special assumptions about the
distributions. All this should serve to emphasize that our econometric
results are designed primarily to be descriptive of the data, not rigourous
statistical tests.

24

that indeed higher income countries are less likely to reschedule that
poorer countries. Since the variable enters best as a squared term, we find
that the very high income countries in our sample are considerably less

likely to reschedule than the poorer countries. Indeed, none of the
countries with a per capita income above $5000 actually reschedules.

Venezuela, at $4220 per capita, is the country with the highest per capita
income to reschedule.

The probit equation for the sample of 24 countries proves to be an

embarrassment of riches. Specifically, the four variables in the model
perfectly discriminate among the reschedulers versus the non-reschedulers.
What this means is that there exists a linear combination of the right-hand-

side variables such that a rescheduling probability of 1n than 0.5 is
assigned by the probit model for all countries that do not reschedule, and a
probability of 2reater than 0.5 is assigned for all countries that do

reschedule. Suppose that fi

is an estimated vector of coefficients with

that property (technically, Zfl is greater than 0.5 if and only if
Then, any multiple of fi,

—

1).

v > 1, will also perfectly discriminate

among the reschedulers. Indeed, higher and higher values of v will raise
the estimated liktihood function, since higher v will assign probabilities
closer to 1.0 for countries that actually reschedule, and 0.0 for countries
that do not.

The upshot of all of this is that because of the small sample, and the
"perfect" fit, we cannot actually estimate coefficients and standard errors

for the probic equation. We can, however, get an ordinal ranking of the
probabilities of rescheduling from "most likely" to reschedule to "least

likely" to reschedule. This list is shown in Table 4. As advertised, the

equation perfectly orders the countries: those that are "most likely" to
have rescheduled are exactly those at the top of the list, and those "least
likely" are on the bottom.

The list itself is extremely illuminating. The "worst" case is Peru.
It is has a hifhly uneaual income distribution, a low share of atriculcure

in CNP, a low Der canita income, and an inward oriented trade Dolicy. It is
perhaps not surprising then that Peru's debt is also the lowest valued of
all the commercial borrower debt on the secondary market as of the end of
1987. For all of the- reasons that Peru- is likely to have rescheduled,

Israel escaped rescheduling: the income distribution is quite equal, the
agricultural share in CNP is large. per capita income is large, and trade

policy is outward oriented. Looking at the ranking of countries, it is
evident that the Latin American countries rank near the very top (with the
exception of Colombia). while the East Asian economies are near the bottom.

The "hard" cases are the countries like Turkey, Tunisia, Philippines,
and Colombia, which fall in the middle of the probability distribution.
Interestingly, Turkey is probably the rescheduling country that has

recovered most vigorously from the debt crisis. Colombia, on the other
hand, narrowly escaped a debt crisis (remember that Urritia calls the period

1983-84 a "mini-debt crisis"). The presence of the Philippines in the

center of the distribution might appear as a bit of a surprise. On most of
the variables, however, the Philippines is not an extreme case: it is fairly

unequal in measured income distribution, especially in comparison with its
East Asian neighbors, but is not as extreme as many Latin American
countries; it has a large agricultural sector which at least in principle

26

should offer the opportunity for a moderately stable, rural based

government. One is led to wonder whether the peculiar characteristics of
the Karcos regime, rather than the inherent structural problems of the
Philippines account for much of that country's economic crisis in recent
years.

Interestingly, the "perfect" results are eliminated if we drop any of

the explanatory variables from the equation. In other words, each of the
variables is helping to account for the rescheduling experience. If income
distribution is dropped, for example, Tunisia and turkey are misclassified.
In Table 5, we show how each of the variables on the margin improves the
predictive accuracy of the model.

The probit results for the sample of 35 countries is shown in

regression 6.1. Note that all of the variables are of expected sign: income
inequality raises the probability of rescheduling, while outward
orientation, agricultural share, and GNP per capita squared, all reduce the
probability .of rescheduling. The equation is no longer "perfect" in the
larger sample, so that we can estimate coefficients and standard errors of

estimate. Income distribution and Agriculture are statistically significant
at the 5 percent level (i.e. t-statistics are greater than 1.96). The
outward orientation variable is not significant in the large sample. Again,
remember that because of the procedures for concocting the outwardorientation variable for the missing countries, that variable is measured
with error and should be e.pected to have a larger estimated standard error,
and a lower t statistic.

The equation now properly predicts 89% percent of the cases (i.e. for
31 out of 35 countries, the probit model assigns a rescheduling probability

of greater than 0.5 for countries that actually reschedule, and a
probability of less than 0.5 for countries that actually do not reschedule).
The countries that are incorrectly classified are: Mauritius, Portugal,

Turkey, and the Philippines. Table 7 presents fitted probabilies of
rescheduling for this sample. Note that Turkey and the Philippines are in
the small sample, and they are among the same countries that were estimated
to be in the center of the probability distribution in that sample. Table 8
presents the fitted probability of rescheduling for this regression.
It is worthwhile to test the robustness of these estimates by including
other variables that have been mentioned by other anaLysts as structural

factors in the debt crisis. One key variable is the terms of trade of the
*developing countries in the l9BOs relative to the l97Os. Are the
reschedulers simply those countries whose export prices deteriorated more
significantly in the l980s, with our own candidate variables proxying for

the terms of trade decline? To test this possibility, we include as a
right-hand-side variable the terms of trade of the countries in 1983
relative to an average terms of trade in the l97Os (measured as the simple

average for 1970, 1975, and 1980). As seen in Table 8, most of the
countries experienced a terms of trade decline in the l980s, but there is
little evidence that the extent of the terms-of-trade deterioration in fact

played a major role in affecting which countries required rescheduling and

which ones did not. Many oil exporters (e.g. Venezuela), for example,
enjoyed a terms of trade improvement comparing the 1980s and the l970s, but
in fact succumbed to rescheduling, while many oil importers (such as Israel,

Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand) suffered a sharp terms-of-trade deterioration
without a rescheduling.

The probit model in the sample of 35 countries is estimated with the

terms of trade in regression 6.2. The terms of trade is statistically
insignificant, while the other variables maintain their earlier signs and

approximate magnitudes. The variables for income distribution and
agricultural shares remain significant. The weak finding on the terms of
trade is consistent with earlier studies, particularly Sachs (1985), who
showed the the differences in experiences of Latin American and East Asian
countries economies could not be explained by differing patterns in the
terms of trade.

Since most of the rescheduling countries are in Latin America; and
since the Latin American economies are characterized by extremely unequal
income distributions, it is important to check whether the income
distribution variable is merely proxying for other characteristics of the
Latin American economies (note that 10 of the 12 economies in Latin America
and the Caribbean reschedule, while only 5 of the remaining 23 countries

reschedule). In other words, is the income distribution effect truly
structural, or is it merely a dummy variable for Latin America? To examine
this question, we introduce in regressions 6.3 and 6.4 two alternative dummy
variables for the region, depending on whether we count Trinidad and Tobago

as part of Latin America. (If the idea of the dummy variable is to measure
an effect specific to "Latin" societies, Trinidad and Tobago should be
excluded; if the idea is to capture a geographical effect in which the
creditor banks redline the developing economies of the Western Hemisphere,
then Trinidad and Tobago should be included in the dummy variable).

Rather remarkably, the both versions of the Latin American dummy
variable are statistically insignificant, and while their introduction

29

reduces the significance of income disribution, the magnitude of the
coefficient on income distribution increases and the dummy variable for
Latin America has the unexpected sign (lower probability of rescheduling.

controlling for the other variables)? In other words, once our structural
variables are included, the fact that a country is in Latin America does not

seem to have raised the probability of rescheduling. It is also worthwhile
to verify that the equation is not proxying for the East Asian economies. A
dummy variable for East Asia also is insignificant, has less effect on the

other variables (equation 6.5), and also has the unexpected sign. Adding
both the Latin American and East Asian dummy ,ariables yields similar
results (not shown).
-

Another convincing way to verify that we are picking up something more
than a "Latin" effect in our regression model is to run the probit model for
the non-Latin
countries

American sample. There are, of course,

that

a yy small number of

remain in the sample, but as seen in regression 6.6, all of

the structural variables maintain their signs and increase in magnitude in

the non-Latin sample of countries. Given the small size of the sample, the
statistical significance of the explanatory variables is reduced, but the
income distribution variable remains near the 10 percent level of
significance.

The next step in our investigation is to estimate a Tobit model of the

size of the discount on each country's debt in the secondary market. The
idea of the Tobit model is as follows. We assume that the discount on the
debt is a non-linear function of the explanatory variables that we have
already introduced, with the non-linearity arising from the fact that the
discount on the debt can be positive or zero, but never negative (the

30

discount measures the percentage difference in the par value of the debt and

the secondary market value). For a range of creditworthiness, the debt will
sell at par, i.e. with a zero discount. If the creditworthiness falls below
a certain threshhold, then the discount on the debt becomes positive.

The specific model is as follows. Let D*i be a latent
creditworthiness variable for country i, that is a function of the
explanatory variables

and a random error term v distributed normally,

so that:

-

(4) D*j_ Zfi ÷ v
where

is a vector of coefficients. Higher D' signifies lower

creditworthiness. For

less than or equal to zero, the actual discount

Di is equal to zero, while for D*i greater than zero, the actual discount
Di. is set equal to D*i. That is,

(5)

Di —

D*i <

Di —

D*j > 0

0

In general, D*i represents a threshold for rescheduling. For countries
that have not rescheduled, the discount is zero (or very close to zero).

while for countries that have rescheduled1 the discount tends to be
positive.

In practice, this last observation may be violated. For example,
Colombian debt sold at a 60 percent discount at the end of 1987, despite the

fact that Colombia never rescheduled. For

31

countries that have not

rescheduled, the secondary market price of the debt is not publicly quoted
(e.g. by the investment banks, that send newsletters on secondary market

prices). For those countries, we assume in the tobit regressions that
follow that the actual market discount is equal to zero. This is probably a
good assumption, since if the country's debt in fact traded at a discount,
the secondary market price of the country's debt would tend to be quoted.

It is our basic assumption that the variables that conduce to
reschedulings are the same ones that lead to low secondary market prices for

a country's debt. This conclusion is borne out by the battery of tobit

regressions reported in Table 9. As usual, regression results are reported
for samples of 24 arid 35. In both cases, the income distribution variable
is always positive (higher inequality leads to a greater discount on the
debt), while the outward-orientation variable, the agricultural share
variable, and CNP per capita squared, are always negative (higher values

tend to decrease the secondary market discount). In most regressions, all
of the explanatory variables are statistically significant.

Consider the basic regression over the sample of 24 countries, reported

as equation 9.1. For those countries with a reported secondary market
discount, the actual and fitted values of the debt are reported in Table
10.

Note that among countries with a discount on the debt, Peru has the

largest fitted discount, and the largest discount actually reported in the
data, while the fitted discount on Colombia is the lowest among the

countries with a positive discount. It is instructive to consider the
sources of the fitted discount on Peru as compared with the fitted discount

on a hypothetical average East Asian country. Peru's fitted discount is
actually above 100 percent, at 105 percent, versus the discount of about -2

percent for 'East Asia'9. Of this difference of 107 percentage points, 31

can be attributed to Peru's worse income distribution; another 31 can be
attributed to the lower level of agriculture in Peru; another 44 can be
attributed to the greater outward orientation of 'East Asia'; and, finally,
a negligable amount can be attributed to Peru's lower level of per capita
income.

The tobit model is also an appropriate model for testing the role of
terms of trade shocks, and dummy variables for Latin America and East Asia.

Various results are reported in Table 9. We find that the terms of trade
has even less effect in accounting for the size of the discount on the debt.

While the dummy variables for Latin America and East Asia are always small
and insignificant once we control for the structural variables in our model,
the Latin American dummy variable does have more power than in the probit
regressions.

Many earlier studies have shown that the probability of debt

rescheduling is a positive function of the debt-export ratio. It is
therefore worthwhile to ask whether our variables help to account for the
debt-export ratio, or whether our variables work through some alternative

mechanism (in which case the debt-export ratio might be an additional
explanatory variable).

We conclude this section by examining this issues.

(Table 8 presents the debt-export ratio data)
As shown by regression 11.1 and 11.2, it is the debt owed to private

creditors rather than public creditors that poses the greatest risk of
forcing the country into a rescheduling or reducing the secondary market

The 'predicted discount' cannot actually be negative, of
course, but the prediction for the average of the region is near enough to
zero that no great violation is done.

value of the country's debt (not shown). Note for example that the ratio of
debt to private creditors relative to exports is a highly significant
predictor of reschedulings, while the debt owed to foreign official

creditors, as a proportion of exports, does i help to explain
reschedulings and even has the wrong sign. The relative importance of debts
to private creditors rather than official creditors reflects the fact that
the interest rates on most of the private debt were set on a variable rate
basis, and thus rose sharply when U.S. interest rates increased after 1979.

The interest rates on debts owed to official creditors rose far more slowly
in the early l9BOs.
According to regression 11.4, our set of explanatory variables accounts

well for the cross-country differences in debt-export ratios (note that we

now restrict our atte.ion to debt owed to private creditors). As per our
earlier political arguments, higher income inequality and a lower
agricultural share in GNP are associated with higher levels of debt relative
to exports. The. relationship is not particularly robust, however, since the

statistical significance of the link between income distribution and the

debt-export ratio disappears when we move from the small sample of
countries to the larger sample (regression 11.3).

According to the probit and tobit equations in regressions 11,5 -

11.7,

the effects of income distribution, agriculture, and outward orientation on
the probability of rescheduling and the discount on the debt are fairly

strongly mediated by the debt-export ratio. Even after controlling for the
debt-export ratio, the key variables of our model remain significant in the

tobit analysis. The debt-export ratio itself is statistically significant
once these other variables are included in the regressions. Thus, while

34

high income inequality tends to raise the country's debt-export ratio, it
also seems to reduce the country's capacity to deal, with any particular

level of the debt. Given this, however, the level of the debt-export ratio
seems to have some independent effect.

IV. Additional Variables in the Probability Model

There are many additional variables that have been suggested in the

literature as having played a role in the debt crisis. To our rather
considerable surprise, most of the variables had little explanatory power in
the probit and tobit equations either by themselves or in conjunction with

our other variables. We examined, without success, the following variables
for a possible contribution to our models
the share of manufacturing exports in total exports (expected
to reduce the probability of rescheduling)
the share of fuels, mineral, and metals in total exports
(expected to raise the probability of rescheduling)
the rate of population growth between 1970-85
the size of the population in 1981

the commodity concentration of exports (expected to raise
the probability of rescheduling, because of increased
vulnerability to terms of trade shocks, and increased
difficulty in short-term export promotion)
the rate of national savings (expected to lower the
probability of rescheduling)

Only the last two variables came at all close to adding to the explanatory
power of the model, but neither variable reached statistical significance.

35

10

The regressions with the additional variables are reported in Table 12,

the data in Table 13.

V. Towards an Interpretation of the Linkage of Economic Inequality and
Foreign Debt Management

We have identified four key structural variables that help us to
explain which of the developing countries succumbed to debt crises in the
l9SOs, and we have suggested some of the linkages between the structural

varibles and the outcomes of debt management. In this section we discuss
further the possible linkages between income inequality and the quality of
debt management.

In terms of formal empirical analysis, we have so far made little
headway in measuring the direct linkages between high income inequality,

political and social instability, and external debt crises. We suspect, but
have not yet proved, that the observed correlations of income inequality and
debt rescheduling can be accounted for by two kinds of linkages, operating at

a more basic level: between income inequality and political instability; and
between income inequality and the choice of macroeconomic policies.

We have pointed out that income inequality is likely to affect
political stability in several different ways, making a test of the role of
income inequality for political stability exceedingly difficult to quantify.
In some countries, the income gap between strongly competing social groups
may lead to a coup (as in many Latin American countries, when the government

has been captured by populist forces); in other cases, the same kind of
10

The share of fuels, minerals, and metals in total exports came in
significantly in the smaller sample, but with a netative sign (a larger
share reduced the predicted probability of rescheduling).

competition may lead to a fruitless and debilitating alternation of power

between populists and orthodox politicians. In still other cases, a
government may be able to hold on to power for a considerable period but
only by "bribing" the organized opposition, at the expense of fiscal
discipline.

Through these effects, and others as well, we suspect that high income
inequality hinders the adoption of needed policy changes on a timely basis.
The basic decisions to liberalize trade or to cut budget deficits become too
risky to bear in an environment of high income inequality.- Wiçh regard to
trade policy, for example, the shift away from inward-oriented growth
towards outward-oriented growth seems to require an initial large real
devaluation and sharp reduction in real wages, as demonstrated by several

historical examples: Korea in the early 1960s, Brazil in the mid-l960s,

Chile in the 1970s, and Turkey in the early l980s. It may be the case that
income inequality must be sufficiently modest at the beginning of such
experiments in order to carry out and sustain oolitically a major change of
this sort.

11

Similarly, the maintenance of realistic exchange rates and balanced
budgets is probably more difficult the greater is the income inequality.

Unfortunately, because of the absence of good cross-country data on budget
deficits we have not yet made any formal tests of the links of income

inequality and budget deficits. It is our intention to piece together

Il

It is our guess that at least some of the staying power of the
outward orientation model in East Asia results from the relative equalities
of income in the region. In Latin America, shifts in the trade regime
towards outward orientation have been tried many times, and have repeatedly
failed, under the weight of political protest by aggrieved workers.
37

better data on a country-by-country basis as a prelude to such a testj2
Our analysis remains much too sketchy to attempt to draw any strong

policy implications from our findings. The evidence presented in this paper
says little about how to adapt policy recommendations to the political
constraints that arise from the structural factors we have discussed. If the
causal mechanisms we discuss are important, however, then successful
policies, in particular sucessful stabilization and structural adjustment
programs, will take into account distributional consequences.
While the evidence suggests that low- income inequality is a precious

asset for an economy, we have not yet investigated the efficacy of different

kinds of redistributive policies as ways to enhance the long-term political
stability, and the effectiveness of economic management, in developing
countries. In the absence of an improved distribution of income, however,
we might pessimistically conclude that many Latin American economies will be
faced with continuing cycles of political and economic instability.

12

Similarly, measures of fundamental exchange rate misalignment, such
as those presented in Edwards(1988), might allow a direct test of the
importance of exchange rate misalignment and its relation to our structural
variables.
