METEOR SHOWERS OR HEAT WAVES?
HETEROSKEDASTIC INTRA-DAILY VOLATILITY IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET
ABSTRACT

This paper defines and tests

form of merket efficiency called narket

dexterity which requires that asset prices adjust instantaneously and completely

ARQi models are employed to model heteroskedasticity across intra—daily narket
segments. Statistical tests lead to the rejection of the heat wave and therefore

In the following subsection, our attention is focused first on the heat

varIance of the change in one earket depends solely upon the past shocks in this
