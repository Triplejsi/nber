Since 1970, a new

kind of protectionism involving non tariff barriers (NTBs) has arisen.
The leading instri.aents of this "new protectionis." have been the socelled "voluntary export restraint" or VER, and Its rsletion. the orderly

Consider their legal and political advantages. There are at least three
such advantages.
The first one Is that GAIl

Thus,

It is natural

Quotas are expressly forbidden

The second advantage of VERs compared to less discriminatory measures

is

that the VERS are set on particular industries and countries. Their
inherently discriminatory nature allows producer and labor groups in the
effected industry,

who stand to gain from a VER, to easily coordinate their

efforts in the hope of mutuil advantage.

On the other hand, consumer losses

from higher prices are spread over all consu.ers and this makes it harder to
coordinate opposition to such measures from consumers, since an Individual
consumer has less to lose than th. interest groups in the affected Industry
do.

As VERa on each industry are

call these the "competitive", "monopoly" and

The "competitive" or "C" effect is the only one that operates in
competitive environments.

In

a competitive framework, a VER works by altering

market demand and/or supply functions wherever the constraint is binding.

If

the VER is set at the free trade level of imports it will have no effect,
since such policies only affect equilibrium in competitive markets by being

set

at restrictive levels.
With domestic monopoly and foreign competition, even VERa set at free

trade levels have effects.

These arise because VER5 alter demand and/or

operates in addition to any "C" effect that may occur,
In

an oligopoly model not only do the effects present under monopoly

occur, but because each agent can be affected in the same manner as the
monopolist, and the actions of all agents are interdependent, an additional
effect,

which I call the interactive or "I" effect, arises.

In the analysis of VERa with differentiated products, when firms co.pete
in price and produce substitute goods,

the imposition of a VER on the foreign

firm makes the domestic firm's demand function less elastic for price
increases. This makes it profitable for the domestic firm to raise its price
at what would be the free trade equilibrium.

This is the "H" effect.

The

increase in the domestic firm's price makes the constraint bind on the foreign

—8-

firm bnd makes it optimal for it to also raise its price since it is
effectively supply constrained. This is the essence of the "I' effect.
Both "I" and "N" effects raise domestic profits when the goods are
Substitutes. Moreover,

as long as foreign supply is not constrained too far

below the free trade level, foreign profits also rise along with prices.

This

is basically the argument in Krishna (1983) about how VERs facilitate
collusion with substitute goods.

The equilibrium with a VER is shown to be a

mixed strategy one which gives the domestic firm the profits of a Stackelberg
leader when a particular rationing rule is used, and raises profits both at
home and abroad.
Since Harris (1965) assumes that a yEn makes the domeStic firm into a
Stackelberg leader, his results on profits are similar to the above when goods
arm substitutes. However, when complementary products are considered, there
are no "H" and therefore no "I" effects,

There has been a good deal of work on the effects of VERs in other market

briefly review some of

this literature in order to relate the results to those of this paper.5
Work has focused on the effects of VERs in Stackelberg leadership models,
Cournot models, repeated game models, and on the quality change effects of
quotas.

The models traditionally used are duopoly or monopoly models since

they ar. the si.plest ones in which such issues can be adressed.

it is

a bit unsatisfactory to use
