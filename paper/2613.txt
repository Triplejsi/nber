FISCAL POLICY WITH IMPURE
INTERGENERATIONAL ALTRUI SM

ABSTRACT

Recent work

demonstrates that dynastic assumptions gtarantee the

irrelevance of all redistributional policies, distortionary taxes, and
prices——the neutrality

of fiscal policy (Ricardian equivalence) is only

the "tip of the iceburg.'

In this paper, we investigate the possibility

of reinstating approximate Ricardian equivalence by introducing a small

of friction in intergenerational links. If Ricardian equivalence
depends upon significantly snorter chains of links than do these
amount

stronger

neutrality results, then friction may dissipate the effects

that generate strong neutrality, without significantly affecting the
Ricardian result.

Although this intuition turns out to be essentially

correct, we show that models with small amounts of friction have other
untenable implications.

We conclude that the theoretical case for

Ricardlan equivalence remains tenuous.

Introduction
In recent years, Robert Barro's [1974] version of "Ricardian

equivalence" has stimulated much controversy concerning the effects of
government

In his well—

the traditional overlapping generations

model with intergenerational altruism, and argued, in essence, that
voluntary transfers between parents and children cause the representative family to behave as though it is a single, infinite—lived
individual——a "dynastic" unit.

From the point of view of the family,

neither debt nor social security alters available alternatives; both are
therefore neutral.

Barro's analysis identifies the strength of

The purpose of this paper

formally

is

to evaluate the preceding argument by

introduciing various forms of friction into a model with

altruistically motivated intergenerational transfers. We focus on
frictions arising from three sources:

the derivation of pleasure

directly from the act of giving; incomplete information about others'
preferences; and egalitarian social norms that constrain parents to
divide transfers evenly between children. The first two sources of
friction turn out to be quite similar analytically, and give rise to
qualitatively similar results,

Ricardian equivalence by introducing a sufficiently small

Furthermore, for any given amount of friction, one

can reinstate the relevance of other redistributional policies by taking
the population to be sufficiently large (it follows from this that taxes

It is therefore appropriate to think of

intrafamily relations as a kind of circle (pictured in figure 1),
consisting of an outer layer (parents) and an inner layer (children).
This representation of intrafamily relations is unquestionably
highly stylized, and does not reflect the full complexity of family
networks, particularly in cases where these networks span more than two
generations (see Bernheim and Bagwell [1986]). On the other hand, this
framework has the advantage of rendering our current analytic objectives
