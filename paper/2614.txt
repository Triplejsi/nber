JAPANESE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT
AND THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

ABSTRACT

discussions
in Japan have increasingly
recognized the
important role of land values and land-use patterns in Japanese
macroeconomic adjustment.
In Japan in recent years, land wealth
constitutes more than half of financial wealth, a proportion that
is much higher than in the United States and other industrialized
shifts in land-use patterns can have
economies.
Consequently,
important effects on Japanese savings and investment patterns,
and thereby on the Japanese trade balance and current account.
Policy

This papers studies the implications of land-use policies for the
Japanese macroeconomy using both a theoretical model and a multi.
sectoral dynamic simulation model.

manner which maximizes

Japanese economic welfare and minimizes the economic volatility during

The case for domestic demand expansion is made on several interrelated
levels.

A

major

argument is KeynesIan.

It is widely assumed the U.S. policy

of reducing government deficits will reduce Japanese aggregate demand.
this view, policy should attempt to offset that contractionary

domestic demand expansion.

gr.wth, some assert that Japan should substitute for the U.S.
Another case sometimes made for domestic-demand-led growth is that Japar. is

misusing

high savings by Investing heavily abroad rather than at home.

The argument holds that domestic distortions in the Japanese economy reduce
domestic

investment (e.g. in housing) and favor foreign investment, even

though the social returns of incremental domestic Investment would be higher.
In this view, greater domestic demand in the form of efficient domestic
investment should be encouraged.

Yet another argument is that Japan should

abroad.
There are significant differences of opinion both within Japan and in the
teat of the world about the kind of policiea that Japan should pursue to
spur

domestic demand.

In part those differences reflect different assessments of

the functioning of the macroeconomy, and in pert they reflect the fact that
there ate many differing motivations for wanting to spur domestic demand in
the first place.

There are three main schools of thought
regatdng possible

policy measures. One view holds that

as the U.S.

policy mix changes (towards

fiscal contraction and monetary ease), and the dollar depreciates, normal

market mechanisms will lead to a rise of Japanese domestic demand, even
without maJor policy actions by the Japanese government.1

A competing view

holds that such a market-based expansion would be insufficient to
a U.S. fiscal contraction, and that Japanese fiscal
policy

should thetefote turn mote expansionary, for its own sake and for the rest of
the world.2

A

third view stresses the role of microeconomic

in spurting domestic demand.

An important argument

is

that changes in land-

use policy (including zoning, land taxation, and import liberalization for
foodstuffs) could spur housing demand, and well as investment in
nonresidential

structures, and thereby overall aggregate demand.3

believe that the growing trade imbalances since the early lPSOs have been

In Sachs and Roubini (1987), a multi-country simulation model was used to
assess, however roughly, the quantitative role of these factors in accounting
for the trade imbalances in the United States and Japan. For the U.S. trade
balance, the Japanese trade balance, and the Yen-Dollar real exchange rate,
the effects of the three factors were
quantified, with the results reproduced

in Table 1.

would likely be stimulative on balance for

the Japanese economy, holding fixed the Japanese fiscal policy and money

supply.5 The traditional Keynesian thinking holds that such a policy aix, by
weakening the dollar, will tend to depress Japanese export demand, and thereby
lower Japanese overall demand.

What that analysis underestimates

empirically

is that the policy mix will also allow for a significant reduction in interest
rates, which will spur the non-export portion of Japanese demand.

In other

words, a tight-fiscal, easy-money policy in the U.S. will automatically spur

Japanese domestic demand at the same time that it depresses demand for
Japanese exports.

In sum, the overall effects of the U.S. policy mix on the

level of Japanese output will probably not be large, and may well be positive.

The case for a significant Japanese fiscal expansion might still be made,

not on aggregate demand grounds, but on the putattve urgency of reducing the
Japanese trade surplus at any cost.

It is indeed true that a Japanese fiscal

expansion would have a significant effect in reducing the trade surplus

A reimposition of capital controls, even with unchanged

fiscal policies, could substantially reduce Japan's trade surpluses.

Such a

policy would prevent further capital outflows, and thereby tend to reduce
Japanese interest rates and to spur private investment.

But again, there

would be high costs (both to the financial sector and to the economy as a
whole) of reversing several years of financial liberalization,

and the

putative benefits of reduced international frictions from a cut in the trade
surpluses probably do not justify such a course of policy.

Remarkably, as seen in Table 2, the value of claims to

1984, as opposed to a mere 24 percent in the United States.

The value of land

equalled about 317 percent of GNP in 1984. as opposed to 80 percent of CNP in

One criticiam of our model specification is that it ignores the possibility
of target savings for house purchases.

Ito, }Iayashi,

and Slemrod(l987),

amongst others, have discussed how savings in Japan may be artifically high
due to credit market imperfections which cause the young to save for large
down payments towards housing purchases.

Any policy which resulted in a

change in the price of a housing unit could in turn affect the steady-state
level of wealth by changing the savings of the young for this purpose.

Our

model, which assumes perfact capital markets, ignores this so-called "house

savings" phenomenon.

Thus, the net foreign asset stock initially

In the more carefully specified simulation model of the next section, the
investment boom in housing extends beyond the first period.

This is because

housing investment in the more elaborate model is supplied by a construction
industry,

that produces houses with a rising marginal cost in the short term.

Thus there are 'external" costs of adjustment in the short-run housing boom,
with the price of housing being bid up by the limited capacity of the
construction industry.

This short-run rise in construction costs has the

effect of spreading out over several periods the adjustment of the physical
stock of housing.
We can similarly use the theoretical framework to study the effects of
other types of changes in land policy.

their buildings.

Rather, they rent the land each period, at the same rental

rate as the land in agriculture.

Since the discountedvalue of those rents is

equal to the value of a unit of land, the owners of housing are indifferent

The

remains at 1.11 percent of ON? above baseline for the following few years.

Note that the savings rate begins to fall in the second year, so that the rise

By the third year, the current account deficit is about 0.3

Conclusions and Extensions

The taking-off point for this paper is the current Japanese policy goal of
stimulating domestic demand,

That policy aim has several motivations:

(1)

to

counteract contractionary effects of a shift in the U.S. policy mix towards
fiscal contraction and monetary ease; (2) to reduce Japan's trade surplus in
order to reduce protectionist

and housing

We introduced a theoretical model to study the interactions of
and investment.

The purpose of this model was to emphasize a

number of linkages which are particular to Japan, and could have important
implications

for the affects of policy upon the Japanese economy.

The

key

point from this discussIon is that these policies have effects both on
investment

and savings, often with indeterminate signs.

In general, policies

that reduce agricultural land values tend to raise savings, the external
surplus, and the net foreign investment position, while at the same tIme such

policies tend to raise housing invesment, thereby lowering the external
surplus and the net foreign Investment position.

We emphasize that these results are derived from a

highly stylized model of the Japanese economy, and that more definitive
results could only be obtained by carefully
examining the other important

linkages which we have discussed above, but have nor chosen to focus on in
this paper.
A multi-sectoral

simulation model was then introduced, to begin the process

of quantifying some of these effects.

the more likely it is that a

reduction of land prices would produce a rise in the external surplus, rather
than the fall that is goal of the policy.
Let us conclude wtth several obseriations about the research agenda in this
area.

In our view, it wIll be fruitful to proceed with a more careful

quantificatIonand specificatIon of a model like that presented in Section .
Most importantly, we need to broaden the scope of our theoretical work in
order to determine

the relatIve Importance

of the various tax and trade

policies in maIntaining the high price of land,

In empirical work, much more

information must be included about the patterns of land use in Japan, and the
technical

tradeoffs between alternative uses of land.

Even rudimentary

information such as the average ratios of land to fixed capital in various
uses should be investigated more fully.

Also,

the response of that ratio to

relative price changes should be examined econometrically.
It should be possible to test directly for the effects of land prices on
the cost of housing and on the demand for housing.

Moreover, the links of

land prices to agricultural policies could also be studied fruitfully.

The

extraordinary premium of rice prices above world market levels is a relatively
recent phenomenon, dating back to the late l960s, when the regulations
involving price maintenance for rice were changed.

From the early 1960s to

the late l960s the premium of the domestic price of rice over the import price

of rice rose from about 20 percent to more than 100 percent.22

It should be

prices and land use patterns.

Another area where quantification is

importantly needed is on the effects of tax policies on land allocation
decisions.

Little seems to be known rigorously about the overall effective

tax rates on the different uses of land.

The model has so far neglected various potentially important linkages of
housing investment with other forms of spending, that could significantly
affect the quantitative estimates.

investment,

It is widely believed that Japans relatively low

stock of housing relative to income is matched by a lowsupply of other

consumer durables relative to income.

Indeed, an important reason for the

difference in U.S. and Japanese household savings rates is the fact that
American households save a much larger share of income in the form of consumer
durables (which typically gets counted as part of consumption rather than
savings).

To the extent that a decrease in land prices stimulates housing

demand it is likely that it would also stimulate the demand for other
consumer durables, thereby increasing the liklihood in the short rim of a
significant

reduction in the external surplus. Similarly,

one presumes that

many forms of public investment spending (e.g. on sewage and roads) should
also rise in tandem with a housing boom.

These complementarityeffects in

private demand can be investigated through empirical estimation of copsulner
demand systems.
A further major area for empirical
investigation is the fiscal implications
of the land-use policies.

Bergstert and Cline contended in late 1985 that "Japan, as the second
largest economy in the world and perhaps the major beneficiary of an open
trading system, must alter its fiscal policy substantially and go the extra
mile to deal with the criticisms so widely leveled against its trade

1985, p. 129, More recently, Marris has argued for a Japanese fiscal
expansion: "Europe and Japan have not yet taken expansionary fiscal policy
action on the scale needed to offset the inevitable negative drag on their
growth as the US trade deficit is elfminated." In Marris, S., "Deficits and
the Dollar Revisited", Institute of International Economics, August 1987 p. 39.

Th& role of strUctural policy measures, especially fn the area df land
use, has been a major point of emphasis in several important commissions in
Japan, including the Okita Advisory Committee for External Economic Relations,
April 1985, and the two reports of the Maekawa Commission.

According to OECD estimates, the 1987 fiscal expansion amounted to
approximately a 0.3 percent of ON? rise in the structural deficit in Japan.
Some commentators have attributed Japan's recent rise in domestic demand to
this modest stimulus. In our view, more of the explanation lies in: (1)
falling real interest rates; (2) rising household wealth; (3) the terms of
trade improvement in Japan following the 1986 decline in oil prices, which
only recently have been pasied on to consumers.
4.

This calculation is based on the assumption that Japan pegs the money
supply, and not the interest rate. The U.S. policy mix causes Japanese shortterm tnterest rates to fall. If Japan instead pegged the interest tate, it
might choose to reduce the money supply in response to the U.S. policy
measures, and this could turn the mildly stimulative effect into a mildly
contractionary effect.

the land share of value, since the 31
percent is estimated as the total value of non-farm land in the U.S. divided
by the sum of this value plus the value of net structures. Some of the land
counted in this ratio probably includes land that is not associated with
structures.
The 35 percent estimate is taken from a study of Hayashi, Ito,
and Slemrod (1987), who cite a 1982 survey of the ministry of construction.

8. To the extent that land and government bonds are highly substitutable
financial assets in private portfolios, and to the extent that government
purcahses of land have little affect upon the price of land, a bond-financed
purchase of land would have little effect on aggregate demand.

The price of housing land in Tokyo rose by about 95% in 1987, prompting
protests at the Bank of Japan's low interest rare policies, which were accused
of fueling land speculation. In all of Japan, land prices rose only by about
7%, however. (Data from The Economist, December 5, 1987)

far-reaching measures in large urban areas in order to ensure the promotion of
the orderly supply of housing land and the stability of land prices. 2,4.3
In so doing, it Is necessary to implement specific policies with specIal
attention to: a the redistrIbutIon of space (e.g. easing regulatIons and
restrictions regarding the landfIll reclamation of public waters, promoting
the conversion of paddy land to other uses in urbanization promotion areas,
and reviewIng zoning regulations), b.
the intensive use of land (e.g. easing
regulations regarding on total floor space and promoting urban redevelopment
work to meet the need for more offices and other commercial sites), c. the
greater use of unused or under utilIzed sites (e.g. promoting the thore
efficIent use of government- and corporate-owned sites and encouraging the
conversIon of abandoned plant sites to housirg sItes), d. the utilIzatIon of
new modalities of housing land supply (e.g. formulas allowing joint-use with

the
utilization of tax policy to promote the supply of housing land. (e.g.
strengthening the application of taxation on agricultural land in urbanization
promotion areas to more approximate tax rates on residential land), and f.
the stabIlization of land prices (e.g. utilizing the National Land Use

One interesting preliminary attempt to quantify the potential effects of
the Meekawa Commission recommendations is Takenaka and Ishli (1987). This
otherwise informative study does not, however, attempt to explain the precise
economic channels through which the ?taekawa recommendations would operate.

consumer demand functions are Cobb-Douglas, and where the liquidity
constraint requires that agents pay a fixed proportion of the total cost of a

not change as long as steady-state income did not change. If the policy
considered had no effect upon the nature of the liquidity constraint in the
housing market, than, in a model such as ours, the steady-state level of
aggregate wealth in the economy would be unaffected.
