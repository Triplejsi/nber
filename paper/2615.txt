Production and Trade in Services by U.S. Multinational Firms

ABSTRACT

Direct investment in foreign countries by U.S. goods industries represents a response to differences in labor costs to

amuch

greater extent than

the more rapidly growing investment by service industries. The latter seem to

be less able to allocate different types of production to different areas of
the world, probably because services are less tradable than goods they must

more often be produced where they are consumed or consumed where they are produced. Therefore, while direct investment abroad in goods industries represents

an allocation of production that increases the demand for high-skill labor and
for R & D input in the U.S. and decreases the demand for low-skill labor,
direct investment in service industries, while it increases a firm's share of
foreign markets, is likely to have little effect on the firm's demand for labor
in the U.S. or on the composition of its labor force.

Introduction
Several trends in the U.S. ec-nosy have raised the question of whether
the comparative advantage of the United States has shifted towards service
industries and whether the exports of these industries can help to close the
apparently persistent U.S. trade deficit. One of these trends is the decline
in the competitiveness

of U.S. manufacturing, as reflected in the fall in the

share of the U.S. in world and developed-country exports of manufactured goods
and in the increasing shares of imports in U.S. consumption of manufactured
products. Another is the long—term rise in the importance of service
industries relative to goods-producing

industries, as measured, for example,

by GNP originating, and particularly by employment. One reflection of the
belief in U.S. comparative advantage in service industries is the strong
effort the U.S. has been making to reduce barriers to what is referred to as
trade in services.

*The research reported on here, part of the National Bureaus prograni

-2—
The International Role of Service Industry Multinationals

pts

and Affiliate Production of Services as Alternatives

To understand the nature of the international market For services, some
clarifications of its scope may be in order. To begin with, the analogy between trade in services, as measured in the balance of payments, and the sore
familiar trade in merchandise, is a very tenuous one

Merchandise trade

involves the passage of goods across international borders, no matter who the
buyers or sellers are. A shipment of goods From the

US

to a Foreign country

is a U.S. export even if the good has been produced by a foreign company
operating in the U.S. and even if it is bought by a U.S

company operating

abroad, A shipment of goods from a foreign country into the U.S. is a U.S.
import even if the good has been produced by a U.S. company abroad and even if
it is purchased by a foreign company operating in the U.S. In contrast, there
is little passage of services across these borders. By some definitions of
services, there is almost none; indeed, services are defined by the fact that
production and consumption take place simultaneously

(see,

for example, Hill,

1987). Service transactions in the balance of payments, unlike goods transsctions, are largely defined'by the residence of the transactors; in most cases
either the producers have moved to the point of consumption or the consumers

have moved to the location of production, but the transaction itself takes
place within one country.

There are some exceptions, in which a service, such

as telecommunications, re—insurance, or some banking activities, is produced
in one country and simultaneously consumed in another country, but these are
not a large part of service production or trade

Both the intangibility of

the services and the fact that the seller often has no information about the
nationality or residence of the buyers, mean that the measurement of many 5cr-

—3—
vice transactions is extremely difficult and the data poor.

An additional difference between the two sectors is that while goods
exports are generally the product of a country's goods-producing industries,
many service exports, as reported in the balance of payments, have little to

do with domestic service produc'ng industries.

It seems appropriate, there-

fore, to relate merchandise exports to the domestic output of goods-producing
industries but of more limited significance to relate service exports to the
domestic output of service industries.
The lack of association between 'service exports," in the balance of
payments sense, and U.S. service industries, is illustrated by the content
of U.S. service exports in 1984. Of $131 billion in officially reported
exports of services in that year, $86 billion, or two thirds, consisted of
receipts of income on U.S.

assets abroad (Krueger, 1987). This income was

from capital employed in both goods industries and service industries as well

as from loans to foreign governments and corporations.

Another $6 billion was

receipts of royalty and license fees, mostly paid by foreign manufacturing

affiHates of U.S. companies to manufacturing parents in the U.S. Aside from
government services, the other items, among wnich we might look for some relation to U.S. service industries, accounted for about $39 billion.

Of this

total, travel, which draws on the U.S. hotel and restaurant industries, among
others, in the service sector, but which is consumed entirely within the U.S.,
was almost a third, at $1U4 billion. Transportation, part of which was
wholly within the United States, accounted for $17 billion.
There is a good deal of evidence that service exports are underestimated
in the official data. The Office of Technology Assessment has suggested a
range of $69-91 billion for non-factor services in 1984, the middle of which

-4is about twice the official Department of Commerce figure in the U.S.
International Transactions accounts (OTA,

1986, p. 38), including travel and

transportation. The major revisions suggested by OTA are outside the travel
and transportation items, and would multiply the estimates for those service
items more than four times.

However, some of the major entries suggested by

OTA, Such as construction, franchising (mainly auto and gasoline dealers), and
licensing, were associated with U.S. companies in industries outside the ser-

vice sector,

In any case, the OTA estimates, excluding capital services,

royalty and license fees, travel, and transportation, ranged from $27 to 43
billion in 1982, or 8 to 12 per cent of the official, presumably underestimated, total of goods and services exports.

On the import side, capital services again accounted for most of the
"service" trade, $67 billion or over 60 per cent Out of $111 billion.

Of the

remainder of about $44 billion, U.S. travel "imports" consumed entirely Outside the U.S., were $15 billion.

The OTA estimates for service imports other

than capital services, royalties and license fees, travel, and transportation,
were about $15 to 29 billion, or about 4 to 8 per cent of goods and services
imports ((U.S. Congress, OTA, 1986, p. 38, and Krueger, 1987)
Why then the strong current interest in services? That concern can be
understood by looking at the service-industry activities of U.S.
operating overseas.

The total sales of

firms

all U.S. affiliates outside of goods-

producing industries amounted to over $445 billion in 1982, as compared with
$359 billion in manufacturing, and almost $200 billion in petroleum and coal
mining and refining (Appendix Table A).

That figure of $445 billion undoub-

tedly exaggerates the amount of activity in these service industries for
several reasons. One is that it includes wholesale and retail trade, for which

—5-.
much of the input and output is in the form of commodities.

Excluding these,

are
although they do also involve a substantial amount of service output, we
left with over $150 billion in service industry sales, still far above the
official estimates of direct service exports. The OTA calculations show affiliate sales almost 50 per cent aoove direct exports, and almost three times as
great outside of royalties and license fees, travel, and transportation.
Furthermore, the recent IMF Working Party on the Statistical Discrepancy in
World Balance of Payments Accounts suggested that there was a large degree of
underreporting of foreign investment income of industrial countries (Taylor,
1987). Thus, outside the travel and transportation area, the sale of services
by U.S.

firms to buyers outside the U.S. is performed largely by

U.S.-controlled firms operating in foreign countries. In other words, it is
accomplished through direct investment rather than through trade (on this
point, see also Kravis, 1985, and Lee and Naya, 1986). Not only are direct
service exports considerably smaller tnan sales by U.S. service affiliates in
foreign countries, even by the OTA estisates, but a substantial part of the
direct eports consists of transactlons that take place entirely within the
United States. They are therefore not part of any plans for liberalizating
trade in services. That must be the case for exports of almost all education
and health services and most of travel services, $16 billion out of the OTA
estimate of $80 billion in 1984 service exports.
Is this large overseas output of U.S.-controlled service-industry

firms a

reflection of U.S. comparative advantage in services? Since the output in
these firms is taking place outside the U.S., it would be wrong to associate
it with U.S. comparative advantage. An increase in U.S. comparative advantage
in service industries would be reflected in an increase in the movement of

-6—
service—industry customers to the US., such as a rise in the number of
foreign tourists in U.S. hotels and restaurants, a rise in the number of
foreign students in U.S. universities, or a rise in the use of U.S. medical
facilities by foreigners, as well as in some increase in direct exports of
services
Is an increase in service industry activity overseas by U.S. firms then
unrelated to U.S.

comparative

advantage? The extent of such activity reflects

the comparative advantage not of the U.S. but of U.S. firms in the service
industries. As we have pointed out elsewhere in connection with manufacturing
industries (Lipsey and Kravis, 1985 and 1987), the comparative advantage of a
country's firms can be different from, and move differently from, that of the
country itself. The comparative advantages of firms reflect assets that are
mobile across international borders but not from firm to firm even within a
country, while the comparative advantages of countries reflect assets
(endowments) that are immobile across international borders but mobile between
firms within the country. It is possible, of course, that the comparative
advantage of a country's Firms is in the same industries as the country's comparative advantage, because the firms have built up their knowledge and skills
from their home operations. We might expect that to be particularly likely in
service industries in which the provider of services must move to the consumer
rather than vice versa.
In considering the causes and effects of changes in the extent to which
U.S. firms satisfy foreign demands for services, we wish to make a clear
separation between the two methods of meeting the demand, Changes in exports
translate directly into changes in the use of U.S. factors of production, such

as labor. Changes in U.S.-owned production abroad involve changes

in the use

—7—
of internationally mobile U.S.-owned factors of production, such as capital
and technology. The effect on U.S. labor is more ambiguous. The most negative
effect would be displacement, if production is simply moved abroad without any
change in the level.

Lt could, instead, involve increases in the demand for

labor, if production abroad captures large market shares and requires inputs
of components or services from the U.S.

We begin our attempt to explain the service activities of U.S. multinational firms by describing the types of activities involved and their
growth over the last 35 years or so. The characteristics of the overseas
service activities are then analyzed with a view to relating them to the
characteristics generally associated with U.S. comparative advantage and
with changes in it,
The Scope of the Service Sector
The definition of the service sector varies among authors who write about
it.

Stigler (1956) excluded transportation, communication, and public utili-

ties from the sector in his book on the service industries as did Victor Fuchs
(1968) and Simon Kuznets (1966),

the last describing the basic feature of ser-

vice industries to be that "none of the activities represents in any significant
way the production of commodities; each renders a product that is intangible
and not easily embodied in a lasting and measurable form" (p. 143).
The broadest definition of the service sector is that it includes all the
industries not covered in the goods-producing sectors. That would include
government, transportation, communication, and public utilities, as well as
trade, finance, and personal and business services. We will use a broad definition, but excluding government services, when the data require it, but will
disaggregate the data, where possible, so as to permit comments on narrower

-8versions of

the service sector.

We exclude holding companies, where possible,

because they are basically a conduit for U.S. investment rather than a part of
host-country service industries,
they control forelan companies,

-9Some of the measures of the size of service sector operations available
directly from the data are assets, sales, employee compensation, employment, and
the amount of direct investment.

Assets reflect only capital input and should

be adjusted for price differences. They have the even worse drawback, as compared to net or gross property, plant, and equipment or depreciation, that the
assets may not be in the same location as the fureign affiliate and may not be
inputs into the affiliate's production,
cases,

They may even be in the U.S. in some

Sales in some industries include large amounts of goods imported by the

foreign affiliate and therefore exaggerate production in the affiliate,
although they are the best measure of market share.

Employment and employee

compensation reflect labor input, and employee compensation has the advantage of
combining crude labor input with a measure of human capital input or the quality

or skill

level

of labor, as will be discussed later.

Employee compensation is

omitted from the table only because the shares are very similar in these aggregates to employment shares.

Direct investment reflects the parents

by others.

investment

of Foreign labor or of investment

It has the drawbacks of the asset measure as an indicator of total

input, but these are compounded by the omission of assets financed by borrowing
from sources other than the parent company.

Its main advantage is its availabi-

lity over time and for comparison with other Countries.

From these calculations, we find that the broadly defined service sector
accounted for two thirds of the total assets employed in foreign affiliates, but
for less than half of labor input, sales, and U.S. investment.
the assets is in banking and much of it is provided not by U.S.

by local depositors.

A large share of
investors but

Service industries outside of trade, finance, construction

and public utilities, accounted for under 6 per cent of assets, sales, and

-

employment.
Within the service sector, defined to include all except goods production,
banking was a large part, over two thirds of assets, about 20 per cent of sales,
and about 9 per cent of employment (Table 1). Wholesale and retail trade
accounted for only a bit over 10 per Cent measured by assets, but for over half
of service industry sales and employment.

The other services' share is

largest, over 20 per Cent, measured by employment, but was less than 7 per
cent of sales and 4 per cent of assets.
Trends in the Importance of the Service Sector in U.S. Direct Investment
To follow trends over time in the importance of the service sector, we

must compromise on definitions of both scope and activity, because breakdowns
by detailed service industry of data on assets, sales, and employment were
published in less detail before 1982.

We can follow one measure of the share

of service industries in U.S. firms' operations abroad back to 1929: that is,
their share in the book value of direct investment.

The defects of this

measure were mentioned above, but it is the one for which the historical
record is most readily available.
Two very different trends are evident: one for public utilities, including
transportation and communication, and the other for the remaining parts of the
broadly defined service sector.

U.S. direct investment in foreign public uti-

lities was concentrated in the 1920s; their share of the investment stock hit
a peak Sometime during the early 1930s and declined rapidly after that. By
1985, their Share was only 2 per cent of the total, something like one tenth

of their earlier importance.

The share of other service industries, aside from what appears to have been

an aberration in 1943, was

little over 10 per cent of U.S. direct investment

from 1929 through the niid-1950s.

After 1957, it began to grow, doubling by

1985. it is that growth in the importance of the more narrowly defined sector,
trade, finance, and other services, that is the basis for the belief that the
importance of service industries in U.S.

investment has been increasing

rapidly.

Of the three major components of this narrowly defined Service Sector, the
ones responsible for the Sector's growth after 1950 were trade (largely wholesale trade) and finance, especially the latter.

The finance part of the service

sector

grew from

per cent of total direct investment to over 15 per cent.

The Importance of Trade and Overseas Activity for

U.S.

Service Industry

Multinationals
The impact on the U.S. of the activities of service industry parent companies and affiliates is related to the degree to which they engage in trade
in services1 or affect trade in goods. The extent to which service output is
tradable and the extent to which the competitive advantages of service firms

can be exploited outside their home countries determine many of the other
impacts of service industry direct investment.
Parents in service industries are, on the average, less export-oriented
than those in manufacturing (Table 2). There are exceptions, however.
Companies in wholesale trade, equipment rental, engineering and architectural
services, and construction, all make close to 10 per cent or more of their
sales to foreigners. These service industries, at least,

do not appear to be

confined to their local markets, but most service industry parents do very
little exporting.
Service industry parents not only trade less than parents in goods
industries but also do far less of their trade with their affiliates
(Table 3). Only about 20 per cent of their exports are to affiliates, as compared with about 45 per cent for goods industries. Thus, direct investment
seems to be much less important as a conduit for the exports of service
industry parents than for the exports of parents in goods industries,
The lack of connection between investment and trade is evident on the
import side as well; imports from affiliates are less than 1 per cent of service industry parent sales, as compared with 4 per cent in goods industries.
One reason for the unimportance of trade with affiliates in the service

1We define exports here as sales by a parent or affiliate to a buyer in
another country. For goods industries outside of the petroleum sector, this
is close to the amount of goods physically shipped from the exporting firm.
The meaning is much more uncertain for service industries because "shipment"

must be the fact that the service parents have fewer affiliates,

and have affiliates in fewer countries than parents in goods industries. Thus,
the positive relationships between investment in production abroad and exports
from the home country or by the investing firms, usually found for manufacturing industries, are likely to be of little importance for service
industries.
Unlike their parents, affiliates owned by service industry parents are
quite export-oriented. More than 40 per cent of the sales of affiliates of
service industry parents were exported, while the proportion for affiliates of
parents in goods producing industries was about one third (Table 4). The
highest export propensities are in affiliates of parent firms in wholesale
trade, including petroleum trade, and in equipment rental.
While in most cases the export propensities of affiliates reflect their
parents' industries as well as their own-—that is, the propensities are similar for affiliates classified by their parents' industries and by their own
industries-—there are exceptions. For example, affiliates in financial services are much more export—oriented

than affiliates of financiel service

parents. Affiliates of parents in the equipment rental and public ucilicies
industries are very export—oriented, but affiliates in those industries are
not. On the other hand, affiliates whose parents are in management, consulting, and public relations do relatively little exporting, while affiliates
that are themselves in that industry export more than two thirds of their

where production has taken place. Thus, it is conceivable,

The inference is that the consulting and management affiliates that

are so export-oriented are owned by parent firms in other industries.
The relatively high reported export ratios for some finance sectors are
subject to some of the doubts referred to above in the discussion of assets as
a

size measure. Since much of the assets of a Finance affiliate may be located

outside the host country, exports to the U.S. b, a Caribbean
liate

of a U.S.

financial

affi-

firm may in fact originate in the U.S. and never involve any

factors of production located in the host country.
Aside from financial services

some of the other service industries

appear in the data to be particularly host-country oriented: hotels, advertisirg, health services, and other services all export less than 10 per cent

of their output. Particularly in the case of hotels, there

is good reason to

be suspicious of the reported ratios. The affiliate questionnaire asks for
"sales to persons in affiliate's country of location," a question that would
most likely put sales to many U.S tourists in the category of domestic sales
even though, since the tourists are U.S. residents, the balance of payments criterion would treat the males as exports (see Whichard, 198T).
Almost all of the exports of U.S. affiliates in goods-producing
industries are goods rather than services, and almost all the exports of affiliates in public utilities, finance, and other service industries are services
(Table 5). However, there are some substantial exceptions. Wholesale trade
affiliates, including those in petroleum trade, export goods almost entirely,
as does the construction industry. The wholesale trade affiliates account for
such a large share of service industry exports that the share of goods in
total exports of service industry affiliates is almost 90 per cent.
Another characteristic of the trade of affiliates of service industry

is that it is less oriented to the United States, and particularly to

the parent companies, than is the trade of affiliates of goods producing companies. Their exports to parents are less than half as large, relative to
their total sales, as those of affiliates of goods producing firms, and their
imports from their parents are only a third as large (Table 5). Thus, while
affiliates of manufacturing firms often appesr to be pert of an integrated
structure of supply for the parent companies' coridwide demand, the affiliates

of service firms seem to be much more free-standing, neither supplying their
parents nor bsing supplied by thea to any great degree,
The relatively weak trade connections between affiliates of service
parents and the U.S. and between the affiliates and their own parents are
visible also for affiliates that are themselves in service industries.

Their

exports to their parents, in particular, were only a little more than half as
large relative to affiliate sales as those of affiliates in goods industries
(Table 7). However, affiliates in some service industries were very much
oriented to exports to the U.S. and to their parents, particularly those in
non-bank(rg finance and in management, consulting, and P.R.

The strongest

trade ties with parents and with the U.S., it is clear, are between affiliates
in these two industries and parents in other industries, possibly goods
industries. Thus, the cases in which service affiliates are tied into worldwide intracompany trade networks probably involve parent firms outside the service industries.
For broad industry groups, it is possible to observe differences between
affiliates in industrial countries and those in LOC5 in the extent of their
trade ties with the U.S. Those in LDC's were more closely tied to the U.S. as
a market than those in developed countries.

However, the outstanding cases of export orientation were finance affiliates

in Bermuda and the Netherlands Antilles. The former exported to both the U.S.
and other countries, while the latter dealt mainly with the U.S. These two
countries overwhelmingly dominated the data for the finance sector in LDCs
most of the LDCs had no U.S. finance affiliates at all.

the data

19
show that

service

multinationals

outside

of banking have much smaller shares of their capital and labor inputs producing overseas than do multinationals in goods industries: physical capital
input in affiliates of service parents is only 8 par cent of parent capital,
while in goods industries it is more than a third,

Labor input

of

in affiliates

service parents is a little under 20 per cent of that of the
parents while in
goods industries it is close to half (Table 8).

Banks, in sharp contrast to

most other service industries, hold a third of their assets through their
foreign affiliates, although their share of labor input in affiliates is close

to that of other service industries.
The capital and labor input measures of Table 8 give partial views of the
extent to which these firms operate outside the United States, More comprehensive measures, comparing sales and production inside and outside the U.S.' are
given in Table 9. The difference between the sales and production columns is in
the treatment of parent shipSents to affiliates. The sales column includes affiliates' imports from their parents in affiliate sales but not in
parents' sales,

hiie

the production estimate treats all parents' sales as
parents' prcdicton

and subtracts parents' shipments to affiliates from affiliate sales to estimate
affiliate production.

By both of these measures, parents in goods industries are more international than those in service industries. There are a few
exceptionally
international service industries, however, that are close to or even above the
level

of the goods industries, and particularly that of
manufacturing. The

most international of the service companies are those in banking and oil and
gas field services, but in advertising, engineering and architectural services, construction, and wholesale trade, foreign affiliates' sales are at

a third of parents' sales. The largest differences between the sales and

production measures are in primary production and manufacturing, because
imports from parents are relatively important as a part of affiliate sales.
The one respect in

international is their exporting. As could be inferred from the fact that
export propensities are higher

fr

service industry affiliates than for

parents in service industries, a large part of service exports is accounted
for by the affiliates. For firms in the service industries, more exports were

made from affiliates than from their parents. That was true also for manufacturing, but the margin was larger for services, mainly as the result of the
large exports of finance industry affiliates. Thus, financial service
industries seem to have chosen their affiliates to serve not only host-country
markets, but other markets as well,

including the U.S. As noted earler,

however, these finance affiliates are heavily concentrated in a few Caribbean
and West Indies countries.

inputs of labor and capital, a fact that is implicit in the higher export
propensities of affiliates relative to parents mentioned above.
Characteristics of Multinationals

in Service Industries

Service industries are often described as offering mainly low paid jobs to
workers of little skill, and it is usually assumed that service industries are

more labor intensive than goods producing industries.

in the service

If they did, and

were characterized by low physical capital and particularly by humsn capital
intensity, it would not be likely thst these industries would be ones in which
U.S. firms would have any comparstive advantage.

itionsandConceta
The measure of labor input we use in forming ratios of capital or other
inputs to labor is the number of employees. Annual hours of work would be
better, but work hours are available in the benchmark surveys only for production workers in manufacturing; these workers account for not much over half of
the manufacturing employment of majority-owned foreign affiliates (U.S.

Dept. of

Commerce, lgSSa, Table II1.F 13) and less than 40 percent of all employment in
majority—owned affiliates (MOFA5) (Table 1II.F 11).

Some inkling of the dif-

ference the use of hours could make is given by the fact that among 32 detailed
manufacturing industries for which hours data are provided, the highest number
of annual hours per worker (averages across host countries) was 27 per cent
abcve the lowest (Table 1II.F 14).
For the measures of nonhuman capital input, the published reports of the
benchmark surveys offer several varianta of assets, including total assets and
gross and net property, plant and equipment. All three measures are based on
historical coat and are converted from local currencies to U.S. dollars via
exchange ratsm, whereas purchasing power parities for capital goods would be
preferable converters, at least for fixed capital.

"Net property, plant and

equipment" (hereafter "net property"), in addition to the assets named, includes
land, mineral rights, construction in progress, and capitalized tangible and

intangible natural resource exploration and development costs.

Total assets

include current

Toe case for

unsest-

ments is clear; investments in other firms or entities do not represent capta'
employed in the production carried on within the enterprise.

However, bank

accounts and other receivables may also represent capital used outsde the affiliate's country and do not necessarily contribute to output in the affiliate's
host country,

The difference between the total asset and net property concepts

is particularly great for financial institutions, for which fixed assets play a
small role in input.
Our measure of human capital or skill intensity is average compensation per
worker, including fringe benefits as well as wages and salaries. This suffers

—

from

23 —

the previously mentioned defects of employment as a measure of labor input,

and average compensation per hour would be preferable if it were available. A
further problem is that, where employees of affiliates are concerned, the cornpensation, paid mainly in non-dollar currencies, is converted to dollars via
exchange rates. The appropriate converter is the purchasing power of each
currency over labor of different qualities, The exchange rate method understates
the purchasing power of the currencies of low income countries, particularly
ever unskilled labor (Kravis and Lipsey, 1982; Bhagwati, 1984) and thus
understates these labor inputs. Also, the premium for education and skill in
different countries is inversely correlated with the per capita income level,
and employee compensation for different industries may, on this account also, be
influenced by the industry to industry variations in the distribution of

hate employment over countries with different per capita

affi

incomes,

An alternative approach to human capital would be to measure labor quality
directly by characteristics of the labor force. A difficulty with this procedure
is that such quality indexes have

to be based on proxies, such as years of

cation completed or school enrollment,

not

the relation of which to productivity is

well established. Furthermore, the indexes would

apply

to a nation's labor

force as a whole rather than to the corkers employed by individual parents
and affiliates or even the aggregate of affiliates in individual countries.2
The last type of capital input we examine is the input of technology in the
form of research and development. The measure should ideally be in the form of
the return on technological capital plus the depreciation on it or, as in the
case of physical capital, at least the stock of technological capital.
Unfortunately, we must settle for the current investment in such capital in the

of research and development expenditures, with the factor input ratio

proxied by R & 0 expenditures per worker.

A mitigating factor is that because P

& 0 investment is much more stable than physical capital investment, a single

expenditure gives a better estimate of the long-run rate of expenditure

and of the accumulated stock than would be the case for a single years data on
physical capital investment.
Factor Intensities of Service Sector Multinationals
Contrary to the common impression, parents in the combination of sectors

we refer to as services operate with higher physical capital intensity than
those in goods production and particularly those in the manufacturing sector.
About half of the service industries are relatively

labor intensive, but there

are a few that are extremely capital intensive, such as petroleum trade and
services, real estate, equipment rental, and transportation and public utilities (see Table 10).

affiliates are more capital intensive than their

parents in four cases and the uneighted average of ratios of affiliate to
parent capital intensities is 82 per cent, consideraDly above the average
ratio for manufacturing.
The fact that affiLate physical-capital intensities are closer to those of
parents in most service industries than they are in

manufacturing

suggests that

in these ind,stries, there is less room tnan 4n manufacturing, either for

adjusting factor proportions to take advantage of ioer wages outside the
U.S. or of splitting up the production process into labor—intensive and capitalintensive segments and moving the labor-intensvesegments to the developing
countries.
Despite their

overall physical capital per worfrer relative to service

parents, affiliates of service industry parents are, on the average, as
capital intensive as those of manufacturing parents.

With only one exception, the service industries in

which

additional capital intensive service sectors in finance and wholesale trade.
In fact, by this standard, more than half of the service industries were more

The capital-intensive service affiliates were sostly

A surprising feature of these capital intensities

is the high values for

affiliates in developing countries. In manufacturing, parents are more capital-

intensive than affiliates in developed countries and they, in turn, are more
capital intensive than affiliates in developing countries.3

That is the

ordering one would expect if firms responded to labor costs by adjusting the
capital intensity of production in each location, or allocated their production processes among locations according to the capital intensities of the
processes and the prices of labor in different locations. No such allocation
can be observed for service industries.

In many of them,

it is the affi-

liates in developing countries that have the highest assets per worker, even
larger than those of their parents.

A drawback of this measure of capital intensity, mentioned ebove pege

9)

is that financial assets attributed to an affiliate, unlike plant and equipment, are fairly likely to be located outside the host country, and to
contribute little or nothing to host-country production or employment. Some
evidence for this phenomenon is provided by a comparison between value added
in affiliates and value added in the whole host-country industry, as reported
in national accounts.

Somtimes, as

is the

case

in the Bahamas and Panama,

the estimated value added in U.S. affiliates, particularly for financial sec-

implication is that almost all the assets of these affiliates are outside the

the financial sector are purely paper transactjons, shifting the nomina1
ownership of assets to developing countries, but not increasing the availability

of capital to their businesses, households, or governments.

The cost to

the

U.S. economy, if there is any, may be limited to whatever fees the host governments can extract for providing the service of registration or incorporation.
Since the service is almost costless to produce, the competition to provide it
is probably keen enough to keep the price charged quite low.
The average skill level of employees of parent firms in service
industries is, if we judge by average compensation levels, well below that of
employees of parent firms in manufacturing.

There are, however,

a

number of high-skill service sectors, including

those associated with the petroleum industry, public utilities, and construction.

Within the grouos more usually identified as services, finance other

industry affiliates, in contrast to their parents, are relatively

high—skill operations. Manufacturing multinationals and all goods producers in
the aggregate apparently go further in allocating their low-skill operations to
developing countries.

This is suggested by

a

comparison between manufacturing

and service industries with respect to average compensation in different
groups of countries.

In manufacturing, average compensation in developing

countries is less than half that in developed countries, and less than a third
of that in parent operations, while in service industries, average compensation in developing countries is only 15 per cent below that in developed
countries, and a little more than 40 per cent below that in the United States.
In fact, in a number of service industries, such as management consulting and

countries is even above that of the parents in the United States, and above
that of affiliates in the developed countries (Tables 10 and 13). Thus, there
is little evidence that these industries allocate their activity to take

of skill than manufacturing affiliates. This was true

not only for the average, but for service industries in general.

Of those

service industries shown separately in Table 13, 16 out of 22 pay higher compensation per employee in developing countries than do manufacturing affiliates. This suggests that U.S. service industry multinationals are either
sending highly skilled employees to work in deieloping countries, or are using
or training highly skilled indigenous workers.
U.S. multinationals in service industries do,

in fact, use a higher pro-

portion of U.S. citizens in their labor forces abroad than do manufacturing
firms, but the numbers are so small relative to total employment that they
could not account for the difference in measured skill levels.

The high skill level in service affiliates, particularly those in
developing countries, points up the major difference between direct investment in services and direct investment in manufacturing mentioned earlier.
The manufacturing operations seem to be more able to take advantage of low
labor Costs fl

developing

countries, perhaps for serving worldwide markets.

The service operations show little evidence of that incentive.

this

contrast

bet-

abroad by U.S. firms in goods industries is more likely to reduce the demand
for low-skill labor at home then investment by service industries.

The reason

is that investment in goods industries more frequently represents an allocation of the firm's worldwide production to take advantage of differences in
labor cost. Foreign affiliates in most service industries, on the other hand,
are apparently more free-standing, independent operations, much less tied to
their parent companies by trade links.

Aside from finance affiliates in a few

countries, affiliates of a service industry parent are a way for the parent to
exploit its skills in competing in the host country market, and do not compete
with their parents for these markets. If this is the case, the likelihood of
any substitution of host country input for home-country input would seem very
small, and the likelihood of a complementary relationship also slight, except
perhaps for some managerial service, P & 0, and similar central activities.
Factor Intensities and the Provision of Services to Foreign Buyers

We inferred earlier that the comparison between parent and ffilite
characteristics suggested that firms in goods industries were able to allocate
different parts of their production to different areas of the world, placing
labor-intensive and low—skill operations in LOC5, but that firms in service
industries were less able to do that, probably because the stages of production could not be separated.
In this section we explore the extent to which factors that explain the
exports of American multinationals from the US., and their production (salesl
abroad through foreign affiliates, differ between goods and service industries.
There is a substantial literature on the factors explaining exports by U.S.

-

32 —

goods industries, and particularly manufacturing industries, and some on the
relation of foreign production to exports among and within manufacturing
industries (Baldwin, 1971 and 1979, and Branson and Monoyios, 1977, for the
former issues, and Lipsey and Weiss, 1981 and 1984, and Blomstrdm, Lipsey, and
Kulchycky, 1988,

for the latter),

but little on the service industry sector.

Some possible determinants of the extent to which production by multinational firms in an industry is carried on outside the United States are examined in Table 14. The unit of observation here is an industry, not a firm,
In the first four equations, variables representing the usual factor intensities, physical capital per worker and average compensation per worker, in
parent production do not manage to explain any of the differences in the propen—

sity to produce abroad among goods industries or among service industries,
although P & 0 per worker does seem to be positively related to the extent of
overseas production in goods industries. When the ratio of affiliate to parent
average compensation per worker is added to the equations, some of the other
variables become significant, and this variable is related to differences among
goods industries but not to those among service industries,

Among the goods

industries, the lower the average compensation in affilites reative to that in
parents, the larger was affiliate employment relative to parent employment.
The meaning of that relationship is somewhat ambiguous because the relative
compensation variable combines the effects of any differences in relative wages
for labor of identical quality with the effects of differences in the mix of low
and high income countries in which the affiliates operate and with differences
in the extent to which skill levels differ between parents and affiliates in
particular countries. Since firms in all industries presumably face the same
prices for labor in any given country, the variable is not likely to represent

the relative price of labor encountered by different industries.
interpretation is the one alluded to earlier:

A possible

goods industries, in which firms

can divide up their production into parts requiring different levels of skill
and different capital inteOsities tend to produce more abroad and thus to hire

more of their labor input abroad, and to produce more in low-income countries
abroad.

Given their ability to divide up their production, and to produce in

one country for consumption in another countrj, some goods producers a:'

fire

the lower-skilled workers among those available in any partcular foreign
country and concentrate production in low-wage countries

Among service

is not
industries, however, this separation of parts of the production process
areas of the
feasible; firms cannot produce in very different ways in different
world, and there s, therefore, no correlation between average compensation differences between parents and affiliates and the extent of overseas production.

A test of our hypothesis that the firms

in goods producing industries are

more able to allocate employment to low-wage countries than are firms in servce
industries is to ask how much of the interindustry differences in affiliate wage
levels anu affiliate compensation levels relative to parent compensat:on levels
is accounted for by intenindustry differences in the country distribution of
affiliate employment. We estimated what the average affiliate compensation in
each industry would have been if the only differences among industries had been
in the geographical distribution of employment; that is, if each industry had

paid the identical average compensation in each area We then correlated this
estimated compensation level with the actual one and with the actual ratios of
affiliate to parent average compensation, with the following results:

Interindustry differences in average affiliate compensation and relative
affiliate/parent compensation levels reflected the geographical distribution of
employment to a much greater degree than did those of service industries. It
appears that among goods industries, the greater the opportunity to reduce production costs by allocating labor-intensive elements of production to iox-age
countries, the greater the extent of foreign relative to domestic employment.4

When the factor proportions and R & 0 variables of Table 14 are used to
explain differences in export propensities among goods industries and among service industries in Table 15, they do so to a much greater degree than for
foreign employment propensities.

Again, large differences betaeen goods

industries and service industries emerge.

Factor intensities of parent frms do

explain a substantial part of differences in export propensities among goods
industries, but not among service industries. The P & 0 intensity of an industry
is the only statistically significant variable at conventional levels of the

t-ratio, but there is also some suggestion among goods industries of a negative
relationship with physical capital intensity and a positive one with the average
skill levels of employees.
If we add to these equations a variable for the ratio of parent to aft i-

hate average compensation levels, the results suggest that large gaps in

corn-

4Since foreign production is labor intensive relative to domestic production,
the allocation of production is not identical to the allocation of employment.

levels, which were important determinants of overseas production, had

no visible effect on export propensities among goods industries or among service
industries.
Conclusions
Although service transactions in the balance of payments have clearly been
underestimated, corrections for the understatement would still leave sales by
foreign affiliates as the main channel through which U.S. service sector firms
serve foreign markets, Service sector firms have played a smaller role in U.S.
direct investment abroad and in foreign direct investment in the U.S. than have
firms in goods producing sectors, but the share of the narrowly defined service
sector (excluding construction and public utilities) in investment has been
growing rapidly. The service industries mainly responsible for the growth in
U.S.

investment have been wholesale trade and financial services, including

banking.
There appear to be major differences in behavior between goods and service
industries. Service sector parents other than those in wholesale trade export
less of their output and, in particular, trade less with their own foreign

fFi]iates. Service industry foreign affiliates, on the other hand, are about as
export-oriented as goods-industry affiliates. However, for some service affiliates, particularly those in wholesale trade,

the exports are almost entirely

of goods rather than services. The share of the exports of service affiliates
that goes to their parents is much smaller than for
goods-industry affiliates.
Service sector affiliates are more similar to their parents in two respects
than are those in goods industries. One is physical capital intensity and the
other is human capital or skill intensity. It is clear that multinationals in
manufacturing allocete their activities in such a way as to respond to differen-

-

35

-

ces in labor cost by producing labor-intensive products or by using labor-intensive methods of production in countries in which labor is cheap (Lipsey, Kravis,
and Roldan, 1982).

In service industries, there is little sign of such an allo-

cation of production affiliates are more similar to parents in each industry,
and affiliates in LOCs are more similar to those in developed countries.
Our interpretation of these facts is that in the service sector, it is more
difficult to break down production for a world market into parts adapted to
various countries' factor prices. Partly, this is because of the limited trademust be produced where they are
bility of services: the fact that most of them
consumed or consumed where they are produced. The -esult is that service sector
affiliates in foreign countries, to a greater extent than goods affiliates, are
like miniature versions of their parents rathe' than specialized elements in a
worldwide production allocation.
While this hypothesis stems from the comparisons of characteristics of
efforts to explain difparents with those of affiliates, it is reinforced by
ferences in the extent of foreign operations and the export propensities of
W:tri resoect to the first, we
parents among goods and among service industes.

found that the Importance of foreign employment relative to domestic employment
in a goods industry was significantly associated with the size of the difference
in average compensation between parents

arid

their foreign affiliates. Our

but not
interpretation of that result is that goods industry multinationals,
those in service industries, can split their operations into low-skill and highskill components and take advantage of low prices for unskilled labor in poor
countries by placing their low-skill operations there. This interpretation is
reinforced by the finding that the proportion of interindustry differences in
affiliate compensation levels and relative affiliate/parent compensation levels

—

that

37 —

is accounted for by differences in the geographical location of affiliate

employment is much greater for goods industries than for service industries.
With respect to exporting, we find that factor proportions explanations of the
pattern of U.S.

exports, particularly the technological intensity of an

industry, works well for goods industries but not for service industries.
The implication of these results is that foreign investment in goods
industries represents an allocation of production among locations that should
produce an increase in the demand for high-skill labor and for P & U input in
parent companies and a decrease in the demand for low—skill labor.

Investment in

service industries, on the other hand, while it increases the multinationals'
shares in foreign markets, and may be necessary for any share, does not affect
the composition of the parents' production or the parents' demand for different
types of labor.
