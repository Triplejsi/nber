Flexible Staffing Arrangements and Emgloyer#' Short-term Adjustment
Strategies
A batract

This paper reports new evidence from a survey of over 400 U.S.
employers concerning their use of temporary and on-call workers.

More

than 90 percent of responding organizations reported reliance on these
flexible staffing arrangements.

They accounted for an average of 1.5

percent of total labor input at user organizations during 1985; at some
organizations, they accounted for 10 percent or even 20 percent of total
Four-fifths of survey respondents indicated that flexible

labor input.

staffing arrangements play an important role in absorbing workload
fluctuations.

Moreover,

organizations with highly seasonal or highly

cyclical demand made significantly greater use of flexible staffing
arrangements during 1985 than organizations with less seasonal or less
cyclical demand.

The use of flexible staffing arrangements appears to

be a more important component of employers' short-term adjustment
strategies than has previously been recognized.

While these models capture important features of

arrangements,

a full understanding of the evolution of flexible staffing

patterns will eventually require consideration of the overall demand for
different sorts of workers and the supply of labor to different sorts of
jobs.

Stochastic Demand for Output
Varisbllity in product demand is one potentially important

motivation

for using flexible staffing arrangements.

Tn a perfectly competitive labor market in which the workers'
preferences for stable versus unstable work were static and firms'
flexible staffing needs were uncorrelated, individual employers would

For both of these reasons,

In a perfectly competitive labor market in which flexible and regular
staffing arrangements coexist, equilibrium wages for flexible staffers
should exceed those for equally-able regular employees; with bl, the
stated assumption holds. 8hapiro and Stiglitz (1984) and Bulow and
Summers (l986 argue that, if labor markets are not perfectly
competitive, it may be optimal for employers to pay some workers
above-market wages. They reason that fear of losing a high-paying 3ob

hours worked by the regular workforce during a given time period will
eventually decline.

For a firm with a given regular workforce, beyond a

certain point it will be cheaper to accomodate higher-than-usual demand
or higher-than-usual absenteeIsm by using supplemental staff rather than
by increasing regular orkers' hours.
Adjusting the size of the regular workforce is another approach to
accomodating changing circumstances. If there is a change in demand or
in employees' labor supply behaviour (for example, an increase in
expected absenteeism) that is expected to persist for an extended period
of time, one would expect an employer to make changes in the size of the
regular workforce.

But one would not expect an employer to hire

additional regular staff to meet short-term needs; any wage savings
associated with using additional regular staff rather than flexible
staffers would be more than offset by the fixed costs of increasing and
then decreasing the size of the regular workforce.

in certain goods-producing industries, inventories may be used to
buffer fluctuations in demand or, possibly, in regular employees' labor
supply. The degree of relIance on inventory buffer stocks will depend,
ilflus on the costs associated with holding them, A strategy
of holding sufficient inventories to cover ol 1 possible contingencies is
likely to he very expensive. Thus, even in industries producing
reasonably standardized and storable products where the use of Inventory
buffer stocks is feasible, there is likely to be a role for flexible
staffers. A similar argument can be made oonoerning the stretegy of
lengthening delivery or waiting times during busy periods. Some
lengthening of the customer queue may be optImal; however, if delivery
or service lags become too long, customers will seek other sources of
supply. Thus, beyond a certain point, It will pay to hire flexIble
staffers.

While previous studies have suggested that many U.S. employers use
flexible staffers, particularly agency temporaries, to my knowledge none
has yielded estimates of how intensively these arrangements are used.13
For each type of flexible staffing, the survey described here collected
two pieces of information that together permit an estimate of use
intensity;

the total number of assignments during calendar year 1985;

and the typical duration of oelendsr year 1985 assignments (which can be
expressed as a fraction of a year).

For each organization for which

both of these pieces of information were reported, their product yields
an estimate of person-years worked by flexible staffers.

This person-

years number was then divided by regular employment as of year-end 1985
and the resulting ratio multiplied by 100 to yield a use intensity
measure that is a rough proxy for the average percentage addition made
by flexible staffers to the regular workforce's labor input over the
14
course of the year.
The second panel of Table 1 reports estimates of

study was carried out by Donald flayell and Kristin

(1985)). Their data apply to 1981. a year in which use of flexible

The

use intensity distribution is markedly skewed.

organizatlone, use intensities are small:

For most

43 percent of user

orgsnzstions had use intensIties for all three categories of flexible
staffers combined of less than

0. 5

percent and another 21 percent had

use intensities of less than 1.0 percent.

But for a minority of user

organizations, use intensities are very large:

0 percent had use

intensities in excess of 5.0 percent and 2 percent had use intensities

excess of 10.0 percent.
An important assumption underlying the discussion in Section II
was that flexIble staffers cost more per hour to employ than comparably
productive regular employees; otherwise, I reasoned, there would be an
in

for employers to employ only flexible staffers, at least in
certain types of jobs. Testing this assumption turns out to be very
dIfficult. The data in the top panel of Table 2 pertain to the direct
hourly costs associated with using flexible staffers. The answers imply

temporary help agencies' per-hour charges typically equaly or

exceed the per-hour wage and benefit costs associated with regular
employees in comparable positions; however, a substantial share of users

The

in the bottom panel of Table 2 are at least consistent with this

implication.

Substantial numbers of organizations assign flexible

poaitiona,

but very few make use of flexible staffers

in either ranagerial/adminstrative or sales positions.

15

NayslI and Nelson (1982) and Nangum, Nayall and Nelson (1985) argue
that the relative median assignment durations associated with each of
the three flexible staffing arrangments reflect differencesin their
respective cost structures.

16 One
might also hypothesize that managerial/administrative and sales
personnel are particularly difficult to monitor, so that it is very
expensive to use flexible staffers in these positions.
It may also
be relevant that managerial/administrative and sales personnel are
most likely to represent the organizstion to the outside world.

How important are flexible staffers in employers' overall staffing

strategies?

The fact that flexible staffing arrangements account for

less than 2 percent of employment at responding firms over the course of
the year might at first blush suggest that they are of little strategic
importance.

But on further reflection,

it is obvious that flexible

staffers could account for an even smaller part of total average
employment but still absorb a substantial fraction of the day-to-day and
month-to-month fluctuation in demand and/or Isbor supply.

Can the Survey Results Be Oeneralizs4t
Given the nonrandom nature of the survey sample,

an obvious

question is whether the survey findings are at all generalizabie. Two
specific concerns are, first,

that the pattern of answers might have

iooked significantiy different had the industry composition of the
sampie more ciosely mirrored that in the economy as a whole, and,
second,

that the organizations responding to the survey are

that organizations that

did not use flexIble staffers might have felt that the survey

For this reason, tne short letter accompsnying the followup

that we were interested In answers from all organizations, including
those that made no use of flexible staffing arrangements.

were warranted, one might expect the answers of those who replied
following the first mailing to differ systematically from the answers of
those who replied only after receiving this second letter.

However,

there were only minor differences between early and late responders'
23
answers,

it would be particularly reassuring if estimates of use frequency
and use intensity based on the survey data could be shown to correspond
to estimates from other sources.

Unfortunately, there is little other

information on flexible staffing use availsble indeed,

the paucity of

information on flexIble staffing usage was the primary motivation for
carrying out the survey in the first place.

The Bureau of Labor

Statistics does collect information on employment in the temporary help
industry that provides one useful benchmark, As reported in Table

1,

my

survey results indIcate that 77 percent of employers used agency
temporaries during 1965 and that agency temporaries sdded an average of
0.76 percent to these firms' employment levels over the course of the
year,

which implies that agency temporarIes accounted for an 00003qo of

0,56 percent of total employment during 1965.

Conclusions

IV.

This paper represents a first lock at employers' use of agency
tempcrarea,

short-term hires and on-call workers.

My starting point

to hypothesize that variability in demand and stochastic variation
in regular employees' labor supply should lead many employers to sake
use of one or more of these flexible staffing arrangements. The models
in Section II developed these hypotheses more formally, and also yielded
was

some additional implications concerning the likely cnaracterlstlca of
flexible slatting assignments and the characteristics of organizations
likely to make the greatest use of flexible staffers.

Nonaupervisory employment in the temporary help industry averaged
691,300 and total nonagricultural payroll emolcyment for the year
averaged 97,519,000 in 1985. The ratio of these two numbers would

organizations that report their demand to be either highly seasonal or
highly variable across yeare make greater use of flexible staffing
arrangements than other organzatona.
While fluctuations in both output and input markets do provide a
central motivation for using flexible staffers,

this does not imply that

other reasons for using flexible staffers are never important.

One

possible alternative motivation is that flexible staffing arrangements
permit employers to do a better job of screening candidates for regular
posItions.

Although very few organIzations report this as a reason

for their use of flexible staffers,

a substantial number say they often

occasionally hire these flexible staffers into regular jobs.
Identification of potential permanent hires thus seems to be, at this
point, mainly an unanticipated benefIt of the use of flexible staffing
or

Bull and Tedeschi (undated) discuss this possibility. Fine and
Gibbons l986) consider screening of temporary workers in a somewhat
different context, in ;hich temporary workers never become permanent
workers, but the firm keeps some temporary workers on the job longer
than others.

Some of the same factors that lead firms to use

flexible staffers may also lead to decisions to contract work out; these
decisions are another important subject for future study,
Considerable recent interest has been focused on the question of
how and why employers' deciaions to ume flexible staffers and to
contract cut have changed over time.

Altogether, 40 percent of the 441 organizations providing information
on changes in flexible staffing use intensity reported greater use of
agency temporaries in 1985 than in 1980, while only 15 percent

In addition,

many observers have pointed to the

growing proportion of youth and women in the labor force if these
workers are more willing than adult men to take temporary and on-call
positions, the relative wages of flexible staffers may have fallen and
thus encouraged their greater use.

Slack labor markets may also have

contributed to employers' ability to restructure their employment
relationships in ways they find advantageous

These hypotheses merit

more careful investgstion.
Finally, this paper has focused exclusively on employers'
decisions concerning the use of flexible staffing arrangements and the
role played by flexible stsffera within the firm.

The broader sooial

implications of employers' reliance on flex±ble staffing arrangements
should also be explored.
