Despite this distinction there are substantial imbalances in date resources in
that the
this area and in the progress in understanding labor-market
available data have made possible. Also, areas where we think that our
kxwle&e has been furthered by recent studies are in fact less advanced than
we believe be"e of problmns with date. Finally, the ability to generalize
our findings is in many cases limited by difficulties involving the interaction
of the sets of data used and the nature of the prthlmm under study.
In Section II I present a general framework for analyzing the appropriateness of a variety of date sets to the porposes for which they are used. This
approach is narrwer than that of Griliches (1986), wbo laid special wçhasis

errors and sysenatic errors of measurenent are likely to be iortant problens

literature, and I pay then relatively little attention in the discussion
hereafter. 2) Is the sauçle that underlies the set of sub.xnits {I} that is

eoonxtric issue of saisple selection bias that has received so much attention

The length of "the short nm' varies with the problen under study. The
intervals in the set {T} should be such as to make it possible for the estimates
of (2) to infons us about the speed with which equilibrii.n is reestablished
after the systen underlying (1) is shocked. Also, while we often view crosssection data as allowing us to infer equilibrii.u relationships, that assuiption
is not necessarily valid. A time series of sufficiently long I can be useful

in allowing the inference of the structure of the equilibria that arise after a
shock. The problen here is to use the level of teiporal disaggregation
aprcpriate to the question under study. Another difficulty arises if the
5

units in (I) are too large to prevent us fran asstnnisq that all underlyi.i
relationships are linear, and thus that estimation over aggregated data yields
unbiased results. Are they emall enoth so that decision makers' ncnlinear
responses can be detected, or are they so highly aggregated that nonlinearities
and disoontinuities are all miothed out? The problem here is that of
appropriate spatial disaggregation.
This discussion is couched in

te

of estimation (of the true underlyim

thoth, labor econunists are interested in hypothesis testii as well as in
estimation. A discussion similar to that above could be developed to deal with
the structurirxj of data appropriate to hypothesis testir. The main difference
would be that, in addition to the four problems discussed above, problems that
produce the eguivalent of the bias te in a mean squared error based on a
and b, we would also have to consider the statistical
oaarison of

distribotions of the

problems we consider here to analyze data appropriate to estimation are a

Labor Supply—Synergy nong Data, Estimation and Theory
Exiriag

the past twenty-fiveyears research on the supply of labor has been

the crown jewel of labor econunics (perhaps even in all of applied econcinics).
We have learned scnnething about important phenunena; major threads of micro-

irical

work have been cplicitly
theory that had not been used in
eiloyed in estimation; and these applications have generated important advances

changes; and there

is clearly no problam of cessive aggregation in what are

chiefly sets of data that have households as the i.mits of observation.
The inortant esplorations in labor supply occurred along with a flowering
of data collection. Careully constructedcross—section sets of iseho1d data
became available during the 1960s; and the cxçuter technology, both barare

to analyze then was developed simultaneously. By the mid-l970s
the major longitudinal household data sets, the National LongitliM n*I Surveys
and the Panel Study of Inoone Dynamics, began to be used to study labor supply.
It is inçossible to believe that the developnent of these sources of
iMoation "forestall (ed] the denise of irical ecoxics," as inplied by
the title of Stafford's (1986) essay, or even to prove that causality ran fron
the development of these data to advances in theory and eoonanetrics. It is
difficult enough to prove causality in well-specified econcinetric nodels
dealing with hypotheses that are grounded in eooncnic theory. One should not
expect in this case to dam,nstrate sanething that historians of science have
debated and about which philosophers of science have prescribed for generations.
One naist believe, though, that we would know a lot less, and labor eoonanists'
fascination with problens of labor supply would be less intense, if these data
sources had not been constructed and the resources devoted to then bad instead
gone into data nore readily usable in other areas of labor ecosanics or in

and software,

other subfields of econcinics.

I believe there have been three major advances in the eiirical study of
labor supply: 1) The estimation of inoc*ne and substitution effects; 2) The
growth in our understanding of labor—force dynamics; and 3) The recognition of
the life-cycle nature of labor supply. Cviously there have been advances in
understanding other supply-related pherena, such as household production,
population and

the demand for education.

is
fairly secure about the relative magnitudes of labor—supply elasticities of
different dexgraphic groups, and
consensus limits have been placed on the
range of the absolute magnitudes of these parameters.
The second advance taught us that for many groups there is substantial
mebility into and out of the labor force. The irk of Heckman and Willis (1977)
and others damnstrated that it is as wrong to view a 65 percent participation
rate as reflecting participation by 65 percent of the population all year long
as it is to view it as reflecting part-year participation by the entire
population. Without longitudindal data this dnstration could nct have been
made. The discovery affected the irse of advances in theoretical ecozetrics,
for it generated an interest in developing eoonanetric techniques to analyze
the detenninants of sover-stayer distinctions. These techniques have been used
ctensively in other areas of labor eooics and have been applied to other
subfields of econcinics as well. Thus, for anple, the distinction between

Retirmnent History Survey. Interest in migration stained fron concern about

The questions and previous studies designed to answer then fall into two

involves the analysis of paths of asployxment adjustment

Aisost all the available evidence (see
1988a, for a survey) suggests
that asploysent responds to shocks fairly rapidly. This means that nrn1 data
are inherently incapable of telling us such abont the underlying path of
ssploymant adjustment: The data are too highly aggregated taçorally. They
are also too highly aggregated spatially. If there is any nonlinearity in the
adjustment process at the micro level, the use of aggregate data will in
general fail to identify it. 7iggregation should be done over the relationships
estimated as characterizing the micro units, not over the micro data in a way
that reguires assuçtions of linearity in those relationships. Since many
reasonable structures of adjustment oosts generate nonlinearities, this set of
studies will not help such in identifying what generates the path of sployment
adjusnt. Because the data oover only manufacturing, it is also hard to
claim that the results do well on the criterion of representativeness.

function. One method is to rsplicate the early studies in specific labor

sore infoznation at lower cost would conbine the longitudinal establisbeent
survey proposed in Section IV with a linked survey of substantial saoples of

Is There a

Need for

Validation Usirq International Data?

In the discussion in Section II I set out as the desiderattu the
auisition of data that will provide the best estimates of the vector of
parameters b describixq the underlyi relationship. Do these parameters
describe behavior generally, or are we only concerned with characterizing
agents' actions in one particular econany? If the former we naist be especially
careful to consider whether, even if our data meet all the criteria for
appropriateness that I have laid out, the results they generate can be used to
draw inferences that apply beyond this country's borders. The issue is basically
one of representativeness of the data, except that too often we think that the
universe we are trying to represent is the eoonany of the particular oountry
where we reside. The obverse question involves the uses to which studies of
other countries' labor markets can be put by 7'.merican econanists. These are
basically: 1) To provide additional laboratories for the estimation of
parameters describing econcinic behavior generally; and

Studies of labor-denand phenanena and of

the interaction of sup1y and dnand in the labor market have been based on
data that are often inaçrcpriately disaggregated, unreçresentative or

wcharacteristic of current structures. Indeed, the trenens resairces
devoted to oollectiu data that are best suited for analyzim labor suçly, and
the consequent availability of those data, have reduced incentives to collect
data that are nore suitable for these other questions.
This is not a condamation of recent axpirical research on issues other
than labor suçly. We have learned a lot; b.it what we can possibly learn about
these issues is severely limited by the lack of açropriate data. Rather than
rely on inaçropriate data, those of us interested in xpirical research in
labor econanics outside the narri and decreasinly fertile area of labor
suly must adopt same of the sociologists' williiness to generate new sets of
data (thoh, one would hope, without abandonim our willirqesa to construct
ndels to organize the analysis of those data). 1lso, given the limited
resources available for collectiog data, we must urge public officials
responsible for funding data collection to get out of the rut of concentrating
on ever-larger and ever-longer sets of household data and redirect resources
toward the kinds of data that are nre likely to yield new basic insights into
the operation of labor markets. The individual data-collection efforts inched
by such a redirection of public and private activities will not be inexpensive
of time and noney. If coupled with sm curtailing of the increasing tendency
