Sovereign Debt:

Is to Forgive

to Forget?

ABSTRACT

International lending to a less-developed country cannot be
based on the debtor's reputation for making repayments.
loans to LDCs will not be made or repaid unless

That is,

foreign creditors

have legal or other direct sanctions they can exercise against
sovereign debtor who defaults.

a

Even if some lending is feasible

because of direct sanctions, having a reputation for repayment in
no way enhances a small LDC's ability to borrow.

The period from 1973 to 1982 saw a startling increase in the

However, the assumption that

very minor changes in the proofs.

The worst fate that can befall a country which defaults

on a reputation contract is that it will never again be allowed

Investment,

it can still buy consumption-insurance contracts by

A "cash-in-advance" contract is just a

conventional insurance contract under which a country makes a
payment up front in return for a state-contingent,
future payment.

Implicitly,

we are aasuming that there are

foreign investors who can make commitments.

These commitments

are enforced by the legal system in investors'

countries.

Thus a

small country can hold foreign assets such as bank accounts,

treasury bills, stocks and other state-contingent aaaeta.9 Of
course,

it can also stockpile reserves of precious metals and

foreign currency.

In particular,

the country must never

switch completely over to cash-in-advance contracts.

(Otherwise,

the contract is not the true implicit contract.)

Given the implicit contract, one can write the world market
value of the country's reputation debt at time t,

D,

as the

expected present-discounted value of its future repayments:

For example, the candidate equilibrium can involve
trigger-strategies as in Eaton and Gersovitz (1981), Eaton,
Gersovitz and Stiglitz (1986), and Grossman and Van Huyck (l987'.
Alternatively, the equilibrium can involve lenders having
imperfect information about the country's utility function
(provided they know that it has a positive marginal utility of
consumption)
11

This specification does not preclude randomized
strategies. One can view 8, as a vector, one of whose elements
has no effect on fundamentls such as output. If the foreign
investor can make legal commitments, then the implicit contract
and the explicit legal contract will coincide whenever P
0. In
states of nature where P

Thus if one traces

out the game tree governed by any

reputation contract, there must exist some node at which the
country can switch to a sequence of cash-in-advance contracts
which dominates the reputation contract.

The collateral for the

cash-in-advance contracts is drawn from funds the country would
otherwise have used to pay back its reputation contract.

Despite

the fact that the collateral may at first be quite small,

it is

still sufficient to provide at least as much insurance as the
