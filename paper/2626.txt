WHAT DOES THE TERM STRUCTURE TELL US ABOUT YUTUKE INFlATION?
Abstract

This paper examines empirically what the term structure of interest
rates tells us about future inflation. The evidence indicates that the
information in the term structure about the future path of inflation is
quite different at the shortest end of the term structure (maturities six
months or less) than it is for maturities of nine to twelve months. For
maturities of six months or less, in all the sample periods examined ——
February 1964 to December 1986, 1964 to October 1979, November 1979 to
October 1982, November 1982 to December 1986 -— the term structure
provides almost no information about the future path of inflation. On
the other hand at this end of the term structure, the results do indicate
that the term structure of nominal interest rates contain a great deal of
information about the term structure of real interest rates. This
finding is quite important because it suggests that researchers can
examine observable data on the shortest end of the nominal term structure
to provide them with information about the behavior of the real term
structure.

For maturities of nine and twelve months, the term structure does
appear to contain information about the future path of inflation in the

longer maturities, however, there does not appear to be much information
in the nominal term structure about the term structure of real interest
rates.

The evidence in this paper suggests that some caution should be
exercised in using the term structure of interest rates as a guide for
assessing inflationary pressures in the economy, as is currently under
consideration by the Federal Reserve. Although there is apparently
significant information in the term structure about the future path of
inflation for maturities greater than six months, there is no information
about the future path of inflation that can be obtained from the shorter
end of the term structure.

I. Introduction

Much recent research has focused on the information in the term

structure of interest rates. Specifically, this research explores to
what extent the relaticnship between interest rates for different maturities helps to predict the future movement of short—term interest rates.
Although Shiller,. Campbell and Shoenholtz (1982) and Mankiw and Summers

(1984) have questioned the value of the term structure in predicting
future short-term interest rates, recent evidence in Faina (1984), Fama

and Bliss (1987), Campbell and Shiller (1986), Hardouvelis (1986) and

Mishkin (1988) indicates that the term structure is capable of forecasting future interest rates.

The information in the term structure can also be examined from a

somewhat different perspective. Fama's (1975) classic study on interest
rates as predictors of inflation suggests that movements in interest
rates primarily reflect fluctuations in expected inflation (the so-called
Fisher effect) rather than changes in real interest rates. Subsequent
work supports this conclusion for the postwar United States except for

the period of the change in Federal Reserve operating procedures from
October 1979 until October 1982.1 This evidence along with the evidence
that the term structure contains information about future interest rate
movements suggests that the term structure might also contain information
about the future path of inflation.

This paper examines empirically what the term structure of interest

rates tells us about future inflation. This is an important topic

Gibbons (1982) and Huizinga and Mishkin (1986).

because inflation is a major concern of policymakers. Indeed, the Federal
Reserve is currently considering using the slope of the term structure as

a policy guide for assessing inflationary pressures in the economy. The
evidence in this paper bears directly on whether such a Fed strategy
makes sense. This paper will alsp provide evidence on the prevalent view
that a downward sloping yield curve reflects expectations of a falling
rate of inflation, while a steeply upward sloping yield curve indicates

expectations of a rising rate of inflation. The behavior of the term
structure has thus been a central element in debates about whether
Federal Reserve anti-inflation policy has been credible or not.

2

In addition, this paper provides evidence on whether movements in
the term structure of real interest rates (which is not directly observ-

able) are revealed by movements in the term structure of nominal interest rates (which is observable). This is also an important topic because
it will tell researchers whether using stylized facts about the observ-

able nominal term structure provides them with information about the
behavior of the real term structure, which has an important role in
understanding asset pricing and in theories of the business cycle.

II. The Basic Methodology

The empirical analysis in this paper primarily focuses on estimation

of two forecasting equations. The first, which will be referred to as
the "inflation forecasting equation," is a regression of the level of the
rn-period inflation rate (g) on the rn-period interest rate

2Blancbard (1984).

3

(1)

Tests of the statistical significance of the

coefficient and whether

it differs from one provide information about whether the overall level

of interest rates helps predict the overall level of future inflation.
This forecasting equation, which was first studied by Fama (1975), is
estimated in this paper in order to allow a comparison of the results
here with those in previous research.

Estimates of this equation,

however, do not indicate whether the term structure contains information
about the future path of inflation because the -term structure could have

no marginal explanatory power for predicting the path of future inflation
and yet

estimates for many maturities could be statistically

significant.

The main focus of the paper is, therefore, on estimates of a fore-

casting equation that does tell us whetherthe term structure helps to
predict future inflation. This equation, which will be referred to as
the "inflation change equation," is a regression of the change in the
future rn—period inflation rate from the n-period inflation rate (n -

the term structure about future changes in inflation.

The regression framework outlined above is quite simple, but we
need to carefully examine the link between nominal nominal interest
rates, real interest rates and expected inflation in order to understand
how to clearly interpret the results. According to the Fisher (1930)

4

equation, expected inflation over rn periods is equal to the rn-period

nominal interest rate minus the rn—period real interest rate:

The realized inflation rate over the next ! periods can be written as
the expected inflation rate plus the forecast error of inflation:

If as in Fama (1975), we assume that expectations are rational and
the real interest rate is constant, tften ordinary least squares (OLS)

estimates of the forecasting equation above produce a consistent estimate

of

= 1 and the nominal interest rate adjusted by a constant is the

optimal predictor of the inflation rate.

We see this by first recogniz-

ing that rational expectations implies that the forecast error of infla-

tion, e, is orthogonal to the right-hand-side regressors because under

rational expectations Et& = 0

——

i.e.,

the forecast error of inflation

must be unforecastable conditional on all available information at time t

which includes i. Constancy of the real rate then makes OLS estimates
consistent because u disappears, leaving an error term for the forecasting equation of e, which is orthogonal to the right—hand-side regressors
under rational expectations and is also a minimum variance error.

If the real rate is not constant, then the nominal interest rate can
still contain information about the future inflation rate but it is no

longer an optimal predictor because u is no longer equal to zero.
Furthermore, if the nominal interest rate is correlated with the real

rate, then u and hence

is correlated with i and the OLS estimate of

will have a probability limit different from one. In addition,
correlation of

and i implies that the OLS estimate of

also will

not be a consistent estimate of minus the mean real rate
The discussion above leads to the following conclusions about tests
on the

coefficient. If the null hypothesis m = 0 is rejected statis-

tically, then nominal interest rates contain significant information

about the level of future inflation. If the null hypothesis m =

I

is

rejected, then the empirical evidence indicates that the real rate of
interest is not constant.

implies that the coefficient [1 -

on the

nominal interest rate i equals zero in the ex—post real rate regression. Since the ex—ante real interest rate is just the conditional
expectation at time t of the ex—post real interest rate, a rejection of

(or equivalently,

—

in the inflation forecasting

equation indicates that nominal interest rates contain significant

information about ex-ante real interest rates.3 Using similar rea-

soning, a rejection of

= 0 (or equivalently, 1 -

= 1)

means that

the null hypothesis that ex-ante real interest rates move one-for-one
with nominal interest rates can be rejected.

A natural way to examine the information in the term structure about
future changes in the inflation rate is to subtract equation (5) for the
n-period inflation rate from equation (5) for the rn-period inflation rate
to obtain,

also indicates that changes in the slope

of the nominal term structure contains significant information about
changes in the slope of term structure of real interest rates.

III. Some Additional Econometric Issues

Before going on to a discussion of the data and the empirical
results, several additional econometric issues that have important

consequences for hypothesis testing need to be discussed. One important
econometric consideration is that the error term fl will be serially
correlated when in

when the number of periods for the inter-

est rate and the inflation rate are greater than the observation inter-

val, as occurs in the following empirical analysis. In this overlapping

will follow an

M(m—1) process. Because of the resulting serial correlation, the
standard errors of the OLS parameter estimates will be incorrect.

Correct standard errors are generated using the method outlined by Hansen
and Hodrick (1980), with a modification due to White (1980) that allows
for conditional heteroscedasticity and a modification suggested by Newey

and West (1985) that insures the variance—covariance matrix is positive—
definite by downweighting the off-diagonal elements.4

4The formula for the variance—covariance matrix of the parameter
estimates, V, is
V =

(T = the number of observations, k = the number of

the variance—covariance matrix of the residuals

and the (i,j)th element of the estimated 0 is defined as

9

Because contemporaneous errors in forecasting inflation for different horizons may be highly correlated, seemingly unrelated regression
(SIJR) estimates of a system of equations with different horizons may

produce substantial gains in efficiency.5 The SUR standard error estimates will again be incorrect because of the serial correlation of the
error terms. The Hansen-Hodricic, Newey—West estimate of the variance—
covariance matrix allowing for conditional heteroscedasticity can be
generalized to apply to a seemingly unrelated regression system of &
equations as follows.6

the off—diagonal elements of the the 0 matrix and the possibility that
has a MA process of order greater than rn—i, I also constructed
Newey-West estimates of the variance—covariance matrix where q is replaced by 2q in the equation above. The estimated standard errors of the
coefficients typically were quite close to those reported in the tables
and none of the conclusions were affected. The results thus do not
appear to be sensitive to allowance for a higher order NA process for the
error terms or to use of a more gradual down-weighting scheme.

rate differentials implies that the error terms

Since under rational expectations these forecast errors are uncorrelate
with all information available at time t, which includes m for all m,
constancy of the real rate differentials implies the conddion for
consistency of the SUR estimates, that all of the explanatory variables
in the equations are orthogonal to all the error terms.

IV. The Data

The empirical analysis makes use of monthly data on inflation rates
and one to twelve-month U.S. Treasury bills for the period February 1964.

to December 1986. The sample starts with February 1964 because this is
the first date that data on all the Treasury bills became available

(twelve-month Treasury bills were not issued until late 1963). Because
six month Treasury bills were first issued in late 1958, tests using one
to six-month Treasury bills can be conducted with sample periods starting

error term of any equation in the system. The order of the MA process is
assumed to be the same for all the equations in the system because
otherwise the Newey—West method used here does not insure that the
variance-covariance matrix is positive definite.
Note that the presence of the 0 matrix in the formula for the
variance—covariance matrix in (8) takes account of serial correlation of
the error terms both within an equation and across equations as well as
for conditional heteroscedasticity in these covariances. Thus even
though SUR estimation only takes account of contemporaneous correlation

of error terms across equations, the variance—covariance matrix above is
corrected for serial correlation both within and across equations as well
as for conditional heteroscedasticity.

in January 1959. The results are very similar to those for sample periods

starting with February 1964 and are reported in the appendix. End of
month T—bill data were obtained from the Center for Research in Security

Prices (CR8?) at the University of Chicago. The one-month bill was
defined to have a maturity of 30.4 days, the three—month bill. 91.25 days,

on up to the twelve month bill with a maturity of 365 days. For each
defined maturity the interest rate was interpolated from the two bills

that were closest to the defined maturity. In effect, this means that
the slope of the term structure is assumed to be constant between these

two bills.8 The interest rates are expressed on a continuously compounded basis at an annual rate in percent as are the inflation rates.

The inflation data is calculated from a CPI series which appropriately
treats housing costs on a rental—equivalence basis throughout the sample
period. For more details on this series see Huizinga and ?lishkin (1984,
1986).

The timing of the variables is as follows. A January interest rate
observation uses the end of December bill rate data. A January observa-

tion for a one—month inflation rate is calculated from the December and
January CPI data; a three-month inflation rate from the December and
Harch CPI data; and so on.9

8iama (1984) instead chooses a bill that has a maturity closest to
six months and then keeps on taking the interest rate from this same bill
every month as its maturity shortens in order to get interest rates on
one to six-month bills. In effect, Fain is assuming that the slope of the
term structure is flat around the chosen bill. The differences between
these two procedures is very slight and makes no appreciable difference
to the results.
9The appropriate dating for the CPI is a particular month is not
clear since price quotations on the component items of the index are
collected at different times during the month. As a result, there is

V. The Empirical Results

Table 1 contains the estimates of the inflation forecasting equa-

tions for horizons of one, three, six, nine and twelve months. Panel A
contains the results for the full sample period, February 1964 to Decem-

ber 1986, while Panels B, C and D contain the results for three subperiods, February 1964 to October 1979, November 1979 to October 1982,
and November 1982 to December 1986. The sample has been split into these

three sub-periods because results in Clarida and Friedman (1984),
Huizinga and Nishkin (1986) and Roley (1986) indicate that the relation-

ship of nominal interest rates and inflation shifted with the monetary
regime changes of October 1979 and October 1982.

For the full sample period, 3m is significantly different from zero
for all time horizons, indicating that one to twelve month Treasury bill
rates do contain a significant amount of information about future inflation. This finding is especially strong for the pre—October. 1979 sample

period (Panel B) where the t—statistics on the

coefficients range from

9.76 to 11.85. However, after October 1979, the one to twelve month
nominal interest rates contain much less information about future infla-

tion. In the October 1979 to October 1982 period of the Fed's nonborrowed reserves target operating procedure, none of the

coefficients are

some misalignment of the inflation data and the interest rate data which
is collected at the end of the month. In order to see if this misalignment could have an appreciable affect on the results, I also estimated
the regressions in this paper lagging the interest rate data one period
(i.e., for the January observation I used the end of November bill
rate). The results with the lagged interest rate data are very similar
to those found in the text and none of the conclusions of the paper
changes.

is negative at all time horizons in •the pre—October 1979

sample period (Panel B), indicating that real interest rates are nega-

tively correlated with nominal interest rates. In the October 1979 to
October 1982 period, 1 t—statistics of 1 —

the real interest rate. After October 1982, 1 -

that the probability of

obtaining that high a value of the test statistic under the null hypothesis that

The results in Table 1 and Table 2 are consistent with earlier

findings in the literature which have examined the relationship between
future inflation and nominal interest rates for a more limited range of

time horizons (one to three months). To summarize the results here:
nominal interest rates with maturities of one to twelve months do contain

a great deal of information about future inflation, especially in the
pre-October 1979 sample period; the constancy of the real rate is
strongly rejected; nominal interest rates are negatively correlated with
real interest rates in the pre—October 1979 period and are positively
correlated with real interest rates thereafter; only during the October
1919 to October 1982 period of the fed's nonborrowed reserves target
operating procedure do nominal interest rates move one—for—one with real
rates; and the relationship between nominal interest rates and future
inflation does undergo significant shifts with the changes in monetary
policy regimes in October 1979 and October 1982.

Although we have found that nominal interest rates contain signifi-

cant information about the level of future inflation at all the maturities we have looked at here, this does not mean that the slope of the
term structure contains information about the future path of inflation.
The significant

coefficients at all maturities may not reflect any

marginal explanatory power for the term structure, but might rather just
reflect the fact that the overall level of nominal interest rates is

correlated with the overall level of future inflation. To see if the

16

term structure helps to forecast future inflation, we turn to the inflation change equations which regress the change in the future rn-period

inflation rate from the n—period inflation rate (n'

of the term structure (i -

i).

- t) on

the "slope"

These results are found in Table 3.

As we can see in Table 3, at the shortest end of the ten structure
(maturities six months or less) the results for the inflation change
equations is strikingly different than that found for the inflation level

equations in Table 1. For all sample periods and time horizons of six
months or less in Table 3, the R2s of the inflation change equations are
near zero and none of the Bmn coefficients is statistically significant.
Further tests, found in the appendix, which look at all combinations of in

and

ii,

for

rn and n less than or equal to six months, also strongly con-

firm these findings. Apparently, the ten structure for maturities of
six months or less contains almost no information about the path of
future inflation.

The results for the longer maturities, nine and twelve months, tell

a different story, however. For the full sample period in Panel A, the
difference between the twelve month and six month rate and between the
twelve month and nine month rate do have substantial information about

the path of future inflation. The P126 and p12,9 coefficients are quite

from one.

Indeed, in three of the four sample periods the [1 —

term is statistically significant from zero at the one percent level,
and for the full sample period, its t-statistic is very large, exceeding
five.

The evidence thus suggests that most fluctuations in the slope of

the term structure at the very short end reflect changes in the slope of

the term structure of real interest rates on a one-for-one basis and do
not reflect changes in expectations about future changes in inflation.

The t—tests of 1 -

nine months, provide some evidence for the the nominal term structure
containing information about the real term structure, but the evidence is

not always strong. For

of eight cases in Table 3, but is statistically significant only once
(when rn = 9 in Panel B, the February 1964 -

October 1979 sample period).

However, additional results in the appendix lend stronger support for the
view that the term structure of nominal interest rates provides information about the term structure of real interest rates for maturities up to
six months.

At the longest end of the term structure studied here, however, the
story is quite different. For in

equal to twelve months, (1 —

m,n1

is

only significantly different from zero in one case, and in this case it
is negative and is only barely significant at the five percent level. The
evidence for maturities around twelve months thus suggests that the term
structure of nominal interest rates does not provide information about
the term structure of real interest rates, but is rather more likely to
reflect changes in expectations about future changes in inflation.

Table 4 indicates that we cannot reject the equality of the

For m,n =

and 12,6,

Table 4 indicates that mn do shift from one sub-period to another, but
as the comparison of the Table 3 versus Table 1 results indicates, these

shifts are in exactly the opposite direction for the inflation change

equations than they are for the inflation level equations. In the
inflation level equations, the

coefficients decline in November 1979 —

October 1982 period and become statistically insignificant, thus indicating that the level of interest rates is unable to forecast the future

level of inflation. In stark contrast, the 96 and p12,6 coefficients
increase in the November 1979 — October 1982 period and become statisti-

cally significant, thus indicating a greater ability to forecast the
and
future path of inflation. Tests for shifts in both a

As was discussed in the section on some additional econometric
issues, if equation residuals across different time horizons are correlated, more efficient estiDates can be obtained by exploiting this

information with seemingly unrelated regression (SUB) estimation. Table

tions found in Table 3, indicates that SUR estimation sometimes leads to
large increases in efficiency --

Table 12 Even greater increases in efficiency can be achieved by
choosing a system of equations in which the error terms are highly

correlated. For example, in the system of eleven equations in which ! =

2,

3,

.

12 and a =

1, SUR estimation results in standard errors which

typically decline by 50% and in a few cases decline by as much as 80%.
The increased efficiency of the SUR estimates, however, does not

change the conclusions we reached before; indeed, in the cases where
there are large efficiency gains it only tends to strengthen them. In

the full sample of Panel A, we find that, in addition to B26 and B12,9,
now is significantly different from zero at the one percent level.
B12,6 also becomes significant in the February 1964 to October 1979

sample period and in the November 1979 to October 1982 sample period, we
now also find that all three of these coefficients are statistically

significant at the one percent level. SUR estimation thus strengthens
the conclusion that the slope of the term structure around maturities of
nine and twelve months provides substantial information about the path of
future inflation.

VI. Conclusions.

The empirical evidence in this paper indicates that the information
in the term structure about the future path of inflation is quite

t2Note, however, that in several cases, the estimated standard
errors are higher in Table 5 than they are in Table 3. Even though the
SUR estimates are asymptotically more efficient than OLS estimates, in
small samples estimated SUR standard errors can turn out to be larger
than OLS standard errors, especially when the order of the MA process for
each equation is taken to be the highest order of the MA process for the
error term of any equation in the system. (This is done to assure
posttxve-definiteness of the variance-covariance matrix. See footnote 7.)

different at the shortest end of the term structure (maturities six
months or less) than it is for maturities nine months or greater. For
maturities of six months or less, in all the sample periods examined --

February 1964 to December 1986, 1964 to October 1979, November 1979 to
October 1982, November 1982 to December 1986 -—

the

term structure

provides almost no information about the future path of inflation. On
the other hand at this end of the term structure, the results do indicate
that the term structure of nominal interest rates contain a great deal of

information about the term structure of real interest rates. This
finding is quite important because it suggests that researchers can
examine observable data on the shortest end of the nominal term structure
to provide them with information about the behavior of the real term
structure.13

For maturities of nine and twelve months, the term structure does

appear to contain information about the future path of inflation. The

13me inability of the shortest end of the term structure to provide
information about the future path of inflation is related to research
that suggests that term premiums undergo substantial fluctuations over
time (Jones and Roley (1983), liankiw and Summers (1984) Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz (1983), and Startz (1982)). If these premiums are an
important enough source of fluctuations in the slope of the term structure, then they can obscure any information that the term structure might
contain about expected changes in inflation and hence future changes in
inflation.
Furthermore since fluctuations in these term premiums are
reflected in both nominal and real interest rates, it is logical that the
slopes of the nominal and real term structures move together.
The fact
that the term structure of nominal interest rates for very short maturities contains a great deal of information about the term structure of
real interest rates is then just a consequence of substantial fluctuations in term premiums which dominate fluctuations in expected changes in
inflation. One way that this could occur is if changes in the inflation
rate are not very predictable for short horizons (as would be the case if
the inflation rate were close to a random walk over short horizons). Then
fluctuations of expected changes in inflation would be small, while
fluctuations in the slope of the term structure of real interest rates
might be high because term premiums vary substantially over time.

22

m,n coefficients

for these maturities are often highly significant in

the full sample period and in the sub-periods before October 1982.14 At
these longer maturities, however, there does not appear to be much
information in the nominal term structure about the term structure of
real interest rates.

The results in this paper on the information in the term

structure

strongly contrast with those which find that, for much of the postwar
period, nominal interest rate movements reflect changes in expected

inflation rather than real interest rates. Furthermore, while the degree
to which the overall level of nominal interest rates reflects expectations
of future inflation decreases dramatically with the change in the
monetary policy regime in October 1979 and October 1982, the information
in the term structure about future inflation remains unchanged for the
shortest maturities, but increases for maturities of nine and twelve

months in the October 1979 to October 1982 period. The nature of the
relationship between the term structure and future inflation is thus
strikingly different from that found between the overall level of
interest rates and future inflation.

The evidence in this paper suggests that some caution should be
exercised in using the term structure of interest rates as a guide for
assessing inflationary pressures in the economy, as is currently under

consideration by the Federal Reserve. Although there is apparently
significant information ia the term structure about the future path of

that the interest rate spread between five year bonds and one year bonds
helps forecast future one—year changes in inflation for horizons of two
to five years.

about the future path of inflation that can be obtained I rom the shorter
