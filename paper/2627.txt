We show

that these differentials arise in markets with consumer discrimination and
incomplete information about the price of the good and the race of the seller.
Equilibrium income distributions have two properties:

mean black incomes are

lower than mean white incomes, and the returns to ability are lower for black

than for white sellers.

Able blacks, therefore, are less likely to self-

select into the self-employment sector than able whites.

Using the 1980

Census data, we find that observed differences in the self-employment income
distributions are consistent with the theoretical predictions.

Introduction

After a long period of neglect, economists have recently begun to
systematicallyanalyze the role that self-employment plays in the labor
market.

This developing literature has already established a few

interestingempirical regularities regarding the determinants of selfemployment rates and the compensation of self-employed persons.

For

example, Blau (1987) finds that changes in tax laws and technology account
for a large fraction of the observed increase in self-employment

rates over

the last two decades; Lazear and Moore (1984) document that the age/earnings

profiles of self-employed persons are substantially flatter than the
age/earnings profiles of salaried workers; and Evans and Leighton (1987)

show that the transition rates into and Out of self-employment are
independent of age and labor market experience.

It is also well known (Moore 1983; 8orjas 1986) that there exist
sizable differences in the characteristics of the self-employment
across ethnic/racial

groups.

In particular, whites have larger self-

employment rates and incomes than blacks or Hispanics.

sector

This fact is hard to

in the traditional framework of an employer discrimination model

since self-employed persons have no reason to discriminate against
themselves.1

This paper presents a theoretical and empirical analysis of

the differences in both self-employment rates and incomes across racial
groups.

Our maintained hypothesis

by consumer discrimination,

is thatthese differences are generated

whereby white consumers dislike purchasing goods

and services from blacks and other minorities (becker 1971).

The simplest consumer discrimination model assumes perfect information
(i.e., consumers costlessly know the price of the good and the race of the
sellers)

and generates an equilibrium of complete segregation (Cain 1986).

-2-

Racial

differences

in self-employment rates and incomes in this model can

only be created by differences across black and white consumers and/or
sellers.

In particular, black and white consumers have to differ in their
for goods or incomes, or there must be racial variation in

preferences

therefore,

The theoretical analysis,

then depends on a number of extraneous assumptions about

heterogeneity between the black and white populations.2
A more powerful analysis results if consumers can only obtain information
about the price of the good and the race of the seller at a cost.

The

existence of imperfect information yields two important implications about
the population income distributions

of self-employed blacks and whites.

First, the mean income level of blacks will be smaller than that of whites

due to consumer discrimination.

Second, the relative gains of entering the

sector are reduced for able blacks.

This expansion, however, requires

that high ability blacks lower their prices in order to "compensate' white

consumers for their disutility.

Our empirical analysis uses the 1980 U.S.

Census and shows that indeed blacks and other minorities are negatively
selected into self-employment, but that whites are not.3

Because of imperfect information, the offer price distribution is likely
to be non-degenerate.

We define an equilibriur price distribution as a set of offer prices and

such that given F(P) consumers choose optimal reservation prices P*(i,j)
that collectively generate C(P*); and given G(P*) sellers choose utility

The (maximum) price whites are willing to pay white sellers [P*(w,w)} is at

[p*(w,b)}:

White buyers set higher reservation prices if they contact a

white seller because their potential gains from search are reduced by the
possibility of encountering a black seller in their next contact.

Further,

since blacks are indifferent to the seller's race, blacks have a single

Finally, our definition of

(l-d)P*(w,w).

If sellers serve a segregated market it will be of the same racial

group as the seller.

Equation

(5)

indicates that sellers of race I must

charge the same or lower price in order to attract buyers of race

j

(i

j).

Sellers of race i, therefore, have no incentive to cater solely to buyers of
race j.
iv.

High ability sellers of any race group only segregate if low ability

sellers of that race group have also segregated.

This result is implied by

the production technology since the opportunity costs of "wasted contacts"
(i.e., contacts that do not result in a sale) are greater the more able the
seller.

This behavior implies that the offer price distribution

can be

ordered as follows:

1'wl

wh

(6)

bh

This ranking follows from the fact that the lowest price a white seller will
ever charge is the black reservation price, and this is the highest price
that a black seller can ever charge.

Further, since within each race group

high ability sellers are more likely to integrate, they cannot charge a
higher price than low ability sellers if they want to cater to all consumers.
In order to assess the impact of consumer discrimination on economic
welfare, it is essential to compare the income distributions of black and
white sellers.

Equation (4) shows that income levels will depend on the

offer price distribution.

In effect, this reduces white income inequality, and thus the impact of

small minority it is unlikely that the black income distribution has less

have an impact not only on the relative size of the black self-employment
sector, but also on the composition of sellers in that sector.11

Moreover,

this prediction of the impact of consumer discriminationdoes not follow
from a simpler complete information model.
Zero search costs imply that buyers and sellers are sorted perfectly by
race and that a single price will prevail in the market.

Since consumers

can costlessly identify the price of the good and the race of the seller in
all firms, there are no "wasted contacts".

Consumer discrimination in a complete information model, therefore, does not
lead to racial differences in the returns to ability.12

There are, of

differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients by race and by

sector, but the overall comparisons of the earnings equations

do not support

the hypothesis that earnings determination in the two sectors is

qualitatively different.20
Of course, the main focus of the study is the determination of the kinds
of selections that generate the pools of self-employed and salaried workers.
The type of selection is determined by the sign of the coefficients of the
selectivity variables.

One key result in Table 4 is that the coefficient of

the selectivity variable in the self-employment income regression is

positive for whites, but zero or negative for all minority groups.

Since,

as defined in equation (16), the selectivity variable in the self-employment
sector (A1) is positive, this result implies that there is positive
selection into self-employment

In

this coefficient is positive for whitea but negative and

significant for all minority groups.

Since the selectivity variable (A0)

is negative in the salaried sector, the coefficients imply that there is

Our theoretical model is based on the premise that personal contacts

discrimination.

To the extent that the degree of personal contact differs by

selection would differ by occupation.

it is unclear a priori which

University of Chicago, and to a referee for helpful comments.

if employers are the only source of racial discrimination in

the marketplace, one would expect that self-employment rates for minorities
would be higher since these groups would find it less profitable to be in
salaried jobs.

substitutes" in the marketplace (i.e.

white self-employment sector, though on a smaller scale.
3Blau (1985) examines the choice between self-employment and salaried
jobs in a self-selection model where individuals differ in their managerial
ability.

His model, however, does not generate predictions about the types

of selection that are expected to arise.
4The assumption that

he

percent black among consumers equals the

percent black among sellers is not necessary for the theoretical analysis.
It only simplifies the notation and the presentation.
5The model can be generalized by allowing black buyers to discriminate
against white sellers.

This extension complicates the presentation of the

analysis, without fundamentally changing the nature of the results. This
generalization will be discussed in more detail below.

Large Numbers, we assume that sellers making n

contacts with consumers contact exactly Gn blacks and (l-9)n whites.
Allowing the number of consumers of each race group to be a random vatiable
to the firm does not alter the important results of our model, but simply
generates variation in income and output across firms of the same race and
ability level.

In addition,

we focus on a "steady state" equilibrium of the

model, where the number of consumers leaving the market in each period just
equals the number of new consumers entering the market.

For simplicity,

we

also assume that each consumer who is searching makes exactly one contact in
the period.
7Thjs property follows from the assumption that utility is additively
separable in income and leisure (Scitovsky 1943)
8Note that the ordering in equation (5) implies that there can be at
most three prices in the equilibrium distribution.

The fact that black and

white sellers may charge the same price implies that price alone is not a
perfect signal for the race of the seller.

10Although the proposition has been derived under the assumption that
contacts are random, and that each sellers probability of encountering a
consumer of race j equals the population proportion of consumers of race j,

-30-

we can generalize our results to allow for racial "ghettos". The existence
of racial ghettos implies that although contacts between buyers and sellers
are random, sellers encounter a larger fraction of consumers of their same
race than the overall population proportions.

It is easy to show that the

proposition still holds given the alternative values of r which result from
racial ghettos, although "ghettoization"

does increase the incentives for

both whites and blacks to segregate.
11Throughout this section, we have used a very simple form of consumer
discrimination by ignoring the possibility that black consumers prefer to
purchase from black sellers.

It can be shown that the key result that the

black income distribution (under certain conditions) is more compressed than
the white income distribution holds even in the general case where both types
of consumers have a taste for discrimination. The ranking of black and white
mean incomes, however, depends on the relative strengths of discrimination by
the two types of consumers and on the percent black in the marketplace.
12

The discussion implicitly assumes that white and black buyers are

"perfect substitutes" in terms of their demands for the good.

Suppose

instead that black buyers have less income and therefore a lower demand for
the good.

High ability black sellers may not be able to attain their optimal

level of output by catering to only blacks, and will have to lower their
price to P(l-d) in order

attract white buyers.

Competition among black

sellers reduces the price in all black firms to P(ld).

This leads to lower

black self-employment incomes, but it is easy to show that

15An extension of Reinganum's (1979) search model to the case of
employer discrimination under incomplete information reveals that, under some
conditions, wage skill differentials remain independent of race.

The returns

to ability for blacks, however, may be reduced in more general formulations
of the model that allow for differential search costs by ability level.

two sets of regressions, however, does not provide any evidence that enclave

21The professional category includes all persons working in managerial
and professional specialty occupations according to the 1980 Census
occupation codes.

All other workers are in the residual category which

includes sales, service, craftsmen, operators,

and laborers.

The fraction of

salaried workers who are in the professional occupation group is 31.2% for
whites,

14.2% for blacks, 14.0% for Hispanics,

and 34.3% for Asians.

The

fraction of self-employed workers who are in the professional occupation
group ia 46.7% for whites, 29.6% for blacks, 34.1% for Hispanics, and 52.4%
for Asians.
22smith and Welch (1979) present an analysis of income inequality by
race, and also find that the black income distribution in the salaried sector
exhibits substantially more dispersion than the white income distribution.
