ABSTRACT
Since the 2001 recession, average core inflation has been below the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.
This deflationary bias is a predictable consequence of the current symmetric monetary policy
strategy that fails to recognize the risk of encountering the zero-lower-bound. An asymmetric rule
according to which the central bank responds less aggressively to above-target inflation corrects
the bias, improves welfare, and reduces the risk of deflationary spirals—a pathological situation
in which inflation keeps falling indefinitely. This approach does not entail any history
dependence or commitment to overshoot the inflation target and can be implemented with an
asymmetric target range.

Introduction

Since the 2001 recession, core in‡ation has been on average below the Federal Reserve’s
implicit 2% target. This phenomenon has become even more severe in the aftermath
of the 2008 recession. In other words, the “conquest of US in‡ation”that started with
the Volcker disin‡ation seems to have gone too far. In‡ation, instead of stabilizing
around the desired 2% in‡ation target, has kept falling down. This de‡ationary bias
is a predictable consequence of a low nominal interest rate environment in which the
central bank follows a symmetric strategy to stabilize in‡ation. We argue that a low
in‡ation target should be combined with an asymmetric monetary policy strategy
calling for more aggressive actions when in‡ation is below target than when in‡ation
is above target.
Figure 1 provides evidence for the stylized fact that we are interested in. The yearto-year PCE core in‡ation is reported with its ten-year moving average. In the early
1990s in‡ation was still well above 2%. By the end of the same decade, the Federal
Reserve had completed the long process that had started with the Volcker disin‡ation.
Around this time the Federal Reserve started discussing the possibility of moving to
an explicit in‡ation targeting regime. While an explicit 2% target was only announced
on 25 January 2012 by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, the existence of an
implicit 2% target predates this historical shift. However, as the graph illustrates,
in‡ation has not stabilized around the desired target, instead it has kept on falling. As
of today, the ten-year moving average is around 1.6%. Importantly, a similar picture
emerges even when removing the 2001 and 2008 recessions. Furthermore, surveybased measures of long-term in‡ation expectations also declined in recent years. The
University of Michigan’s survey-based expectations on in‡ation …ve to ten years out
have fallen by 80 basis points since the 2007. The survey of professional forecasters’
ten-year-ahead expectations on CPI in‡ation has followed a similarly declining pattern
since 2012.
The de‡ationary bias poses serious challenges to the central bank. For instance,
it may entail a considerable reputation loss if the private sector loses con…dence in
the Federal Reserve’s ability to bring in‡ation back to target in an expansion. This
outcome may be very costly as it could impair the central bank’s capability to credibly
commit to future actions, which is particularly critical to stimulate the economy when
the current interest rate is at its zero lower bound (ZLB) constraint (Krugman 1998;
and Eggertsson and Woodford 2003). Furthermore, a prolonged period of low in‡ation

might cast doubts about whether or not the Federal Reserve is in fact committed to
a symmetric 2% in‡ation target, as opposed to a two-percent ceiling on the in‡ation
rate. Such an interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s commitment can be shown to
exacerbate the bias.
In addition to these challenges, we show that the de‡ationary bias is the harbinger
of de‡ationary spirals. De‡ationary spirals represent a pathological situation in which
in‡ation keeps falling unboundedly. The de‡ationary bias arises when the probability
of hitting the zero lower bound is nonzero. To counteract this de‡ationary pressure, the
central bank keeps the interest rate low even when the economy is healthy and away
from the zero lower bound. This de‡ationary pressure can become so large that the ZLB
becomes binding also in good states. Lacking the o¤setting e¤ects of monetary policy,
the real interest rate starts increasing and, in doing so, depresses aggregate demand,
exacerbating the de‡ationary pressure. This vicious circle of low in‡ation, rising real
interest rates, and even lower in‡ation sets the stage for de‡ationary spirals and implies
that no stable rational expectations equilibrium exists. Note that this scenario does
not require any recessionary shock to materialize. All it takes is a su¢ ciently large
risk of encountering the ZLB constraint in the future, which could be driven by an
increase in macroeconomic uncertainty or a fall in the natural interest rate. Given the
persistent and increasing de‡ationary bias observed in the last twenty years, the US
economy might currently be in the proximity of this scenario, implying that remedying
3

the de‡ationary bias is an issue of …rst order importance.
The interaction of the following two factors explains the de‡ationary bias: (i) the
remarkably low long-run nominal interest rates and (ii) the perfect symmetry of the
current monetary policy framework, which treats positive and negative deviations of
in‡ation from the central bank’s target on equal footing. We formalize our argument
using a prototypical non-linear New Keynesian model, which we solve with global
methods to show that in the absence of either one of these two factors the bias would
not emerge.
When the long-run real interest rate is calibrated to the low values that seem plausible today (Laubach and Williams 2003), the model predicts that average in‡ation will
remain below target even during expansions. Forward-looking price setters anticipate
that in case of a large negative shock the central bank will be unable to fully stabilize
in‡ation due to the ZLB constraint on nominal rates. These beliefs bring about de‡ationary pressures and depress in‡ation dynamics even when the economy is away from
the ZLB. All changes in the macroeconomic environment that make ZLB episodes more
likely or more persistent also cause the de‡ationary bias to become more severe. Thus,
a decline in the long-term real interest rate raises the probability of hitting the ZLB
in the future and consequently makes the de‡ationary bias larger. Similarly, heightened macroeconomic uncertainty causes or prolongs the ZLB and, hence, contributes
to exacerbating the de‡ationary bias.
We argue that the symmetric approach to in‡ation stabilization, which is currently
followed by the Federal Reserve, loses e¢ cacy in a low interest rates environment because it contributes to the formation of the de‡ationary bias. An example of the Federal
Reserve’s symmetric strategy is in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary
Policy Strategy, which reads: “The Committee would be concerned if in‡ation were
running persistently above or below this objective. Communicating this symmetric
in‡ation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term in‡ation expectations …rmly
anchored [. . . ]”. We show that in the current low interest rate environment, it is advantageous for the Federal Reserve to be more concerned about in‡ation running below
target than about in‡ation going above target.
The central bank can remove the de‡ationary bias and can raise social welfare by
committing to adjust the policy rate less aggressively when in‡ation is above target
than when in‡ation is below target. By removing the de‡ationary bias, this asymmetric strategy raises the long-term in‡ation expectations and hence makes de‡ationary

4

spirals less likely. The proposed strategy raises the probability of in‡ation on the upside and, in doing so, o¤sets the downside risk due to the ZLB. Thus, an apparent
paradox emerges: In order to interpret its in‡ation target as symmetric, the central
bank should follow an asymmetric strategy. This paradox is only apparent, because
the asymmetric strategy corrects for the constraint represented by the ZLB.
Of course, in practice, it may not be easy for the central bank to convince agents
that it has adopted an asymmetric strategy. When in‡ation is below target, announcing
to be less aggressive in countering future upswings in in‡ation is time inconsistent.1 In
this context, the central bank can conduct an opportunistic re‡ation to demonstrate
its commitment to the asymmetric strategy. To conduct an opportunistic re‡ation, the
central bank announces the adoption of the asymmetric strategy in the aftermath of
a shock that pushes in‡ation above target. Even though this action leads to a higher
in‡ation rate in the short run, which entails a welfare loss, this rise in in‡ation o¤ers
the central bank the opportunity to show to the public that the central bank is now
committed to follow the asymmetric strategy, which raises welfare in the long-run by
removing the de‡ationary bias.2 We show that in our calibrated model an opportunistic
re‡ation improves welfare, unless the size of the shock is implausibly large.
In the minutes of the meeting of September 17-18 2019, the Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC) discussed whether its current long-run framework can be improved
by adopting asymmetric strategies that require to “respond more aggressively to belowtarget in‡ation than to above-target in‡ation,” in line with what advocated in this
paper. Furthermore, according to the minutes, several participants suggested a target
range as an e¤ective way to communicate this asymmetric strategy. We use the model
to show that the introduction of such a range can indeed close the de‡ationary bias and
hence reduce the risk of de‡ationary spirals provided that the range itself is asymmetric
around the desired in‡ation objective. For instance, if the central bank is committed
not to respond to in‡ation when in‡ation is within the target range, specifying a range
between 1.5 percent and 2.85 percent will remove the de‡ationary bias. We show that
while the degree of asymmetry in the range required to remove the bias depends on
1

If the announcement is believed by the public, the de‡ationary bias disappears and once this
happens, the central bank has an incentive to renege on its announcement and to respond aggressively
to future upswings in in‡ation.
2
Under the asymmetric rule, the weaker systematic response to positive deviations of in‡ation
from target raises agents’long-run uncertainty about in‡ation and hence, everything else being equal,
lowers welfare in the long-run. However, in our model these losses are dominated by the gains from
removing the de‡ationary bias.

5

the strength of the central bank’s in-range response to in‡ation, the required degree of
asymmetry is generally fairly modest.
Kiley and Roberts (2017) and Bernanke et al. (2019) study a set of rules to mitigate
the severity of recurrent ZLB episodes. Mertens and Williams (2019) evaluate a large
varieties of monetary policy rules (including dynamic rules such as price-level-targeting
rules, average-in‡ation-rate rules, and shadow-rate rules) and conclude that dynamic
rules, which make up for forgone accommodation after the ZLB episode, can eliminate
the de‡ationary biases and deliver better macroeconomic outcomes than static rules
(such as the Taylor rule). Unlike dynamic rules, the asymmetric strategy we propose
does not rely on history dependence to solve the de‡ationary bias. Therefore, the
central bank is not committed to engineer de‡ation following a period of above-target
in‡ation. Similarly, the asymmetric strategy does not contemplate in‡ation overshooting; that is, a contingency in which the central bank maneuvers the policy rate so as
to create positive deviations of in‡ation from its target to make up for past periods
in which in‡ation ran below the central bank’s target. Unlike the standard approach
in this literature that studies linearized models with a kink in the monetary policy
reaction function, we solve the fully non-linear speci…cation of the model with global
methods.
Adam and Billi (2007) were among the …rst to formally show that the de‡ationary
bias and the corresponding output bias arise in New Keynesian models in which the
nominal interest rate is occasionally constrained by the zero lower bound. With respect
to the existing literature, we emphasize that the symmetry of standard monetary policy
rules (e.g., the Taylor rule) plays an important role for these biases to arise and show
that adopting an asymmetric strategy can remove these biases.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present a prototypical New
Keynesian model to study the de‡ationary bias, the solution method, and the calibration of the model to U.S. data. In Section 3, we introduce a simpli…ed version of the
model to illustrate the conditions that give rise to the de‡ationary bias and when the
de‡ationary bias turns into de‡ationary spirals. In Section 4, we show that given the
low long-run real interest rate, in‡ation fails to converge to the Federal Reserve’s 2%
in‡ation target in the long run. We also assess that the sensitivity of the bias to the
level of macroeconomic uncertainty and to the natural rate of interest. In Section 5, we
introduce the asymmetric strategy and show that it can remove the de‡ationary bias.
We also show that this strategy improves households’welfare compared to following a

6

symmetric Taylor rule. We also show how the asymmetric strategy can be implemented
in the aftermath of an in‡ationary shock (opportunistic re‡ation) to avoid time inconsistency. In Section 6, we use the model to evaluate the e¤ects of introducing a target
range, which was recently discussed by the FOMC as a way to implement asymmetric
strategies of the kind proposed in this paper. In Section 7, we conclude.

The Model

In this section, we introduce a prototypical New Keynesian model in the tradition of
Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000), Woodford (2003), and Galí (2008) augmented with a
zero lower bound constraint for the nominal interest rate set by the monetary authority.
The model is solved with global methods in its non-linear speci…cation.

Model description

The economy consists of households, …nal goods producers, a continuum of monopolistic intermediate goods …rms, a monetary authority, and a …scal authority. Households
buy and consume the …nal goods from producers, trade one-period government bonds,
and supply labor to …rms. The …nal goods producers buy intermediate goods and
aggregate them into a homogenous …nal good using a CES aggregation technology.
The intermediate goods …rms set the price of their di¤erentiated good subject to price
adjustment costs a la Rotemberg. They demand labor to produce the amount of di¤erentiated goods to be sold to households in a monopolistic competitive market. Labor is
the only factor of production. The …scal authority balance its budget in every period.
The monetary authority sets the interest rate for the government bonds.
The Representative Household In every period, the representative household
chooses consumption Ct , labor Ht , and government bonds Bt so as to maximize the

Model Solution and Calibration of Parameters

We solve the model with time iterations and linear interpolation as in Richter et al.
(2014). Expectations are evaluated with Gauss-Hermite Quadrature. A detailed description about how we solve the model is provided in Appendix A
We set the discount factor
to 0:9975 that corresponds to an annualized real
interest rate of one percent, which is in line with the FOMC’s Summary of Economic
Projections (SEP) of September 2018. The standard deviation of preference shocks
d
is chosen to be in line with the standard deviation of the U.S. real GDP growth
rate over a period ranging from the …rst quarter of 1983 through the fourth quarter of
2007. This period has been characterized by record low macroeconomic volatility and
therefore the calibrated value of the standard deviation of preference shocks should be
regarded as low by historical standards. For instance, the standard deviation of the
U.S. real GDP growth rate was twice as big in the 1970s. We will show how trend

9

in‡ation and the long-term real interest rate vary under di¤erent assumptions about
the Post-Great Recession macroeconomic volatility.
The Rotemberg parameter ' is the equivalent to a Calvo parameter of 0.75 in case
of a …rst-order approximation. The calibrated value for the demand elasticity implies
a steady-state markup of 15 percent. The parameter controlling the disutility of labor
is set to normalize the steady-state level of employment to unity.
The persistence of preference shocks is set to 0:60. Higher values for this parameter prevents us from solving the model. The same problem occurs as well if one raises
the variance of the shock too much. Both parameters lift the unconditional volatility
of preference shocks and hence the number of future periods agents expect monetary
policy to be passive because of the ZLB constraint. We set the in‡ation target to 2%.3
The remaining parameters are standard and are listed in Table 1.

De‡ationary Bias and De‡ationary Spirals

To gain intuition about the causes of the de‡ationary bias and its relation with the
de‡ationary spirals, we consider a simpli…ed version of the model presented in the
previous section. We assume that the central bank does not respond to the output
gap ( Y = 0) and that the preference shock can only take two values low (bad state)
d
d
and high (good state); i.e., dt 2
with dH > dL . When the realizations of
L; H
the preference shock are binary, equilibrium outcomes can be conditioned on the high
or low value of the preference shock and hence can be characterized by solving a set
of nonlinear equations as explained in greater detail in Appendix B. This simpli…ed
version of the model will prove useful for understanding the causes of the de‡ationary
bias and those of the de‡ationary spirals and why these two outcomes are intertwined.
Once we have established these points, we will go back to the benchmark model and
the calibration introduced in the previous section.
Given the structure of the simpli…ed model, we can partition the model equilibrium
conditions into two blocks of equations, one for the good state and one for the bad
state. In what follows, we focus on the equilibrium in the good state because - as we
will see - this is the state where the de‡ation bias arises. The red dashed line in Figure
2 represents the interest rate RH as function of in‡ation H as implied by the Taylor
3

There is some disagreement about what the Federal Reserve’s e¤ective in‡ation objective was
before 2012 (Shapiro and Wilson 2019). However, there is a strong consensus that the objective has
been 2 percent since 2010.

rule in the good state, subject to the ZLB constraint. The blue line in the same …gure
con‡ates the restrictions imposed on the in‡ation rate and the nominal interest rate
in the good state by all the other equations. Importantly, this curve also takes into
account the equilibrium conditions for the bad state because agents in the model are
forward looking. The intersections between the red dashed line and the blue solid line
give us the (stable) Rational Expectations equilibria in the good state. Appendix B
describes how these two lines are worked out.
The blue line is downward sloping because a fall in the equilibrium in‡ation rate
in the good state, H , lowers in‡ation expectations and hence the nominal interest
rate in the good state, RH .4 The blue line also presents a kink and gets steeper for
low values of in‡ation in the good state. When in‡ation in the good state declines,
the partial equilibrium e¤ect is such that expected in‡ation declines under both states,

Next period’s in‡ation expectations are the weighted average of the equilibrium in‡ation expectations in the two states. In symbols, Et t+1 = pHH H + (1 pHH ) L , where pHH is the probability

depressing in‡ation in the bad state. When the ZLB is not binding, the central bank
responds by lowering the interest rate in the bad state. However, for su¢ ciently low
levels of in‡ation in the good state, the central bank encounters the zero lower bound in
the bad state. The existence of this threshold creates the kink in the blue line. When
in‡ation is below this threshold, the ZLB constraint is binding in the bad state and
any further decline in in‡ation in the good state implies an increase in the real interest
rate in the bad state, which exacerbates the recession and the drop in in‡ation in the
bad state. In the good state, agents anticipate that the recession and de‡ation in the
bad state will be more severe and these beliefs determine a steeper decline in in‡ation
expectations and the nominal interest rate in the good state. For comparison, the blue
dashed-dotted line captures the counterfactual case in which we do not impose the
ZLB constraint on the nominal interest rate in the bad state and hence the slope of
the blue dashed-dotted line does not change.
The four plots of Figure 2 show the equilibrium in the good state for various levels
of volatility of the discrete shock.5 In particular, we consider scenarios of low volatility
( dL = 0:9875, dH = 1:0025), medium volatility ( dL = 0:9625, dH = 1:0075), high
volatility ( dL = 0:9375, dH = 1:0125) and very high volatility ( dL = 0:9125, dH =
1:0175) with a transition probability of staying in the good state p = 0:9 and staying
in the bad state q = 0:5 …xed for all the levels that are considered. Across the four
panels, we can see that as the volatility of the demand shock increases, the kink in
the blue line occurs for larger values of H , implying that the ZLB becomes a more
relevant concern, even if the economy is currently in the good state.
In the upper left graph of Figure 2, we consider a low-volatility scenario. The
volatility is relatively low and hence the severity of the negative preference shock is
contained. In this case, there are two equilibria in the good state of the economy. One
equilibrium implies that the nominal interest rate is not constrained (the star mark in
the plot) and the other one is constrained by the ZLB (the square mark in the plot)
in the good state.6 In what follows, we disregard the equilibrium implying that the
ZLB is binding in the good state and focus on the other equilibrium, corresponding to
The mean of the binary random variable dt is unchanged when we raise its variance throughout
this exercise. So when we raise the volatility of the preference shock, we e¤ectively make the negative
and positive realizations of the shock bigger.
6
This result is reminiscent of the two steady-state equilibria characterized in a perfect-foresight
environment in the in‡uential paper by Benhabib et al. (2001). However, the equilibria in upper left
plot are derived in a stochastic environment where agents take into account the probability that the
economy may be hit by preference shocks in future periods.

the star mark in the plot. In the upper-left plot, the economy is away from the ZLB.
Furthermore, in this case the negative preference shock is too small to make the ZLB
constraint binding in the bad state. This can be seen by observing that the equilibrium
of interest, which is denoted by the star mark in the graph, lies on the ‡atter part of
the blue line.
We now slightly increase the volatility of the preference shock, which implies that
the negative preference shock is now larger than what it was in the previous case.
Now the target equilibrium lies on the steeper part of the blue line, implying that the
economy will go to the ZLB if a negative preference shock will hit tomorrow. These
expectations have important e¤ects on today’s equilibrium outcomes. Now in‡ation is
lower than what it would have been if the blue line were less steep as in the case in
which we do not impose the ZLB constraint (the dashed-dotted blue line in the graph).
We call the lower in‡ation rate in the good state due to the binding ZLB constraint in
the bad state the de‡ationary bias. The magnitude of the de‡ationary bias is shown
in the graph.
A further increase in the volatility of the binary preference shock causes the nominal
rate and in‡ation to fall further, as illustrated in the lower left graph of Figure 2. Now
the de‡ationary consequences of hitting the ZLB in the bad state are even more severe.
As a result, the in‡ation rate in the good state falls further down and the de‡ationary
bias widens. To respond to this large de‡ationary bias, the central bank has to drive
the nominal interest rate to the ZLB even in the good state. This can be seen in the
graph where the solid blue line intersects the kink of the red dashed line, implying
that the two good-state equilibria now coincide in the graph and the ZLB is binding
in both. Furthermore, note that the de‡ationary bias is now larger than that in the
previous case.
What happens if the volatility increases even further and the realization of the
preference shock in the bad state becomes even worse? The central bank would like
to lower the nominal interest rate further in the good state in order to mitigate the
de‡ationary pressures owing to the severe de‡ation expected in the bad state. However,
the binding ZLB constraint in the good state prevents the central bank from doing so.
As a result, the fall in in‡ation expectations combined with the forced inaction of
the central bank lead to an increase in the real interest rate in the good state, which
depresses in‡ation expectations even further. We call this vicious circle of lower and
lower in‡ation de‡ationary spirals. In the lower right graph, the blue solid line and

13

the dashed red line do not intersect, implying that no stable Rational Expectations
equilibrium exists.
This exercise illustrates two important points. First, the de‡ationary bias emerges
when agents expect with some probability that the interest rate will become constrained
by the ZLB in the future. Second, the de‡ationary bias and the de‡ationary spirals
are intertwined: de‡ationary spirals occur when the de‡ationary bias is so large that
the central bank cannot prevent in‡ation expectations from spiraling down.

ZLB Risk and Macroeconomic Biases

The previous section illustrated the origins of the de‡ationary bias and the link between
the de‡ationary bias and de‡ationary spirals. We can now return to our benchmark
calibration, which are shown in Table 1, with a continuum of possible realizations for
the preference shock.
Hitting the in‡ation target is more challenging for the central bank when the probability of encountering the ZLB is non-negligible. Even in tranquil times and away from
the ZLB, the mere risk that monetary policy might become constrained in the future
hinders the convergence of in‡ation to the central bank’s in‡ation target. This is because forward-looking price setters anticipate that in case of a large negative shock the
central bank will be unable to fully stabilize in‡ation due to the ZLB constraint. These
beliefs cause in‡ation expectations to become disanchored from the central bank’s target and to depress in‡ation dynamics.
The existence of this de‡ationary bias constitutes an important anomaly that should
concern policymakers. Failure to acknowledge this anomaly may lead the central bank
to conduct expansionary monetary policy that ends up overheating the economy and
creating more macroeconomic biases. These macroeconomic biases are broadly consistent with the recent performance of the U.S. economy.7 Moreover, the size of these
biases increases exponentially as the volatility of the macroeconomic environment rises
and the natural rate of interest declines. In the subsequent sections, we will show
that the symmetric approach followed by the central bank to in‡ation stabilization is
responsible for these biases.

Figure 3: The risk of the zero lower bound. Left graph: Expected frequency of the zero lower bound as the variance
of preference shocks varies and for di¤erent values of the long-run real rate. The frequency is in percentage points and
it is computed as the ratio between the number of periods spent at the zero lower bound and the total sample size
(300,000). Right graph: Probability of hitting the zero lower bound next period conditional on being at the stochastic
steady state in the current period for di¤erent values of the variance of preference shocks and of the steady-state real
rate. The probability is expressed in percentage points.

Probability of encountering the zero lower bound The left plot of Figure 3
shows the percentage of periods spent at the ZLB when the model is simulated for a
long period of time (300,000 periods). In technical jargon, this is the ergodic probability of being constrained by the ZLB. As shown in the …gure, this probability is
a¤ected by how volatile the shocks are (x-axis). The di¤erent lines are associated with
1
di¤erent assumptions about the long-run annualized real rate of interest r =
.
Our benchmark calibration for this parameter is one percent, which is in line with the
FOMC’s projections (SEP) of September 2018. The red stars on the lines denote the
calibrated standard deviation of the preference shock.
A lower long-term real interest rate raises the expected frequency of the ZLB as
it shrinks the central bank’s room of maneuver to counter the de‡ationary e¤ects of
recessionary shocks. We are closer to the bound on average so the central bank is
expected to hit the lower bound more often. Note that the expected frequency of the
ZLB as a function of macroeconomic volatility grows at an increasing speed as the
long-term real interest rate r falls. Symmetrically, a given drop in the long term real
interest rate r implies larger increases in the probability of encountering the ZLB if
the volatility of the shock is higher. Thus, the more volatile shocks are and the lower
r is, the higher the expected frequency of the ZLB, with the two e¤ects reinforcing
each other.
The graph on the right shows how likely it is for monetary policy to become constrained by the ZLB in the next period conditional on being currently at the (stochastic)

15

steady state. As for the expected frequency of the ZLB, we study how this probability
varies as we change the standard deviation of the preference shocks and the steadystate real rate of interest r . The larger the volatility of the shock, the more likely
it is that the ZLB will be binding in the next period. It should be noted that the
probability rises exponentially with the volatility of the shock. Lowering the long-term
real rate of interest leads to similar results.
The worrying …nding highlighted by both graphs is that in a low real-interest rate
environment (low r , black dashed lines) the two functions are very steep. This means
that even a small increase in the volatility of the shocks can lead to substantial increases
in the probability of encountering the zero lower bound. Recall that our benchmark
calibration for the volatility of the preference shock is arguably very low for the U.S.,
given that it was chosen to match the level of volatility during the Great Moderation.
The results above imply that even a small increase in macroeconomic volatility may
lead agents to believe that the ZLB constraint has become a pervasive problem for
monetary policy. These beliefs cause serious macroeconomic biases and distortions
and can potentially lead to de‡ationary spirals.
Deterministic and stochastic steady state To show that in‡ation fails to converge to the central bank’s target in the absence of in‡ationary shocks, it is useful to
de…ne the stochastic steady-state equilibrium of the model.8 We de…ne the de‡ationary bias as the di¤erence between the rate of in‡ation at the stochastic steady-state
equilibrium and the central bank’s in‡ation target, which coincides with the rate of in‡ation at the deterministic steady state. The de‡ationary bias arises when in‡ation at
the stochastic steady state is lower than the central bank’s target. A large de‡ationary
bias implies serious hurdles for the central bank to hit its in‡ation objective.
Both the deterministic and stochastic steady states de…ne an economy that has not
been hit by shocks for a su¢ ciently long number of periods, so that their variables have
stabilized around their steady-state values and do not vary anymore (unless a shock
suddenly hits). However, in the deterministic steady state, agents fail to appreciate the
macroeconomic risk due to future realizations of the shocks. Instead, in the stochastic
steady state, agents appreciate the macroeconomic risks due to future realizations of
the shocks and adjust their behavior accordingly. While in a linear model these two
concepts of steady-state equilibria lead to the same macroeconomic outcome, in non8

Some scholars use the terms “risky steady state” to refer to what we call stochastic steady state.
See, for instance, Coeurdacier et al. (2011).

16

linear models whether agents act in response to future macroeconomic risks matters.
Unlike the stochastic steady state equilibrium, the deterministic steady-state equilibrium of our model can be characterized analytically.9 The real interest rate in the
deterministic steady state, r ; coincides with 1 and captures the long-run level of the
real interest rate in the absence of risk. Importantly, r = ln ( ) also coincides with
the deterministic steady state of the natural interest rate. The deterministic steady
state of in‡ation is pinned down by the in‡ation target of the central bank, ; and
can be e¤ectively dealt with as a parameter. Since the price adjustment cost function
takes into account the deterministic steady-state in‡ation rate, the chosen value of the
in‡ation target does not a¤ect any macroeconomic outcomes either at the deterministic steady state or away from the deterministic steady state. Thus, the deterministic
steady state for output Y is purely determined by the level of TFP.
Unlike the stochastic steady state, the deterministic steady state is not a¤ected by
macroeconomic uncertainty, which in‡uences the optimal behavior of rational agents
in non-linear models. Such volatility drives a wedge between the outcomes of these
two steady-state equilibria and hence fuels the de‡ationary bias. In this section, we
will show that among the many sources of non-linearity in the model (e.g., the nonlinearities that give rise to precautionary savings), the zero lower bound constraint is
the main culprit behind the formation of the de‡ationary bias and all the associated
macroeconomic biases.
The De‡ationary Bias The left graph of Figure 4 shows the di¤erence between the
in‡ation rate at the stochastic steady state and in‡ation at the deterministic steady
state with (blue solid line) and without the zero lower bound constraint (black dashdotted line). Comparing the blue solid line with the black dash-dotted line allows us
to isolate the e¤ects of the ZLB constraint on the in‡ation bias. From the …gure,
it is easy to conclude that when removing the ZLB constraint, the gap between the
deterministic and stochastic steady state is quite low. Instead, the risk of hitting the
zero lower bound can lead to large discrepancies between the desired and realized levels
of in‡ation.
9

As shown by Benhabib et al. (2001), there exist two deterministic steady-state equilibria once the
zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is taken into account. The …rst steady state is characterized
by positive in‡ation and a positive policy rate. The second steady state is characterized by a liquidity
trap, that is, a situation in which the nominal interest rate is near zero and in‡ation is possibly
negative. In line with most of the literature studying new-Keynesian models, we focus on the positivein‡ation deterministic steady state.

Figure 4: Macroeconomic distortions due the zero lower bound as the volatility of the preference shocks varies. Left
graph: The in‡ationary bias due to model’s non-linearities. The red star denotes the calibrated value of the standard
deviation of this shock. The di¤erence between the blue solid line and the black dot-dashed line captures the de‡ationary
e¤ects of a risk of a recession that pushes the nominal interest rate to its lower bound. Center graph: the same as the
left graph but the bias is computed with respect to output (level). Right graph: the same as the left graph but the
bias is computed with respect to the real interest rate. The gray area marks the region of the values for the standard
deviation of the preference which trigger de‡ationary spirals. Units: In‡ation and real interest bias is measured in
percentage points of annualized rates while the output bias and the standard deviation of the preference shocks are in
percent.

The red star denotes the de‡ationary bias that arises at the benchmark value of the
standard deviation of the preference shock (Table 1). In‡ation undershoots the central
bank’s in‡ation target by 27 basis points because of the risk of hitting the ZLB in the
future. As the macroeconomic volatility increases, the bias widens up exponentially.
A one-percentage-point increase in the standard deviation of shocks causes a 15-basispoints reduction in the model’s long-run in‡ation rate. Furthermore, it would take
just a two-percentage-point increase in the standard deviation of preference shocks to
make de‡ationary spirals possible. Given that our benchmark calibration re‡ects a
record-low macroeconomic volatility, this result is a reason for concern.
It should also be noted that the steepness of the function of the de‡ationary bias
has to be chie‡y imputed to the presence of the ZLB constraint. Indeed, the slope
of the black dash-dotted line, which captures the counterfactual case where the ZLB
constraint is not enforced and nominal rates are allowed to become negative, is tiny
and close to constant for di¤erent values of the standard deviation of the shocks.
What if the central bank realizes that in‡ation is in general below the desired target
and decides to lower its in‡ation target to make it coincide with average in‡ation? The
de‡ationary bias induced by the ZLB constraint would become even larger because
lowering the target would make the probability of encountering the zero lower bound
even larger. We discuss below what the central bank can do to bring in‡ation in line
with the desired target.
18

The Output Bias The center graph of Figure 4 shows the e¤ects of the risk of
hitting the ZLB on the long-run level of output. As before, the long-term output bias
due to the zero lower bound is given by the vertical di¤erence between the blue solid
line and solid dashed-dot line, which gives us the bias when the ZLB constraint is
not imposed. The output bias is positive because the central bank has a two percent
in‡ation target but in‡ation ‡uctuates around its stochastic steady state that is lower
than the central bank’s target (see the left graph of Figure 4). As a result the central
bank keeps the interest rate lower than its deterministic steady-state level to close the
negative in‡ation gap. Since the central bank applies the Taylor principle ( > 1),
this expansionary monetary policy leads to a negative bias in the real interest rate, as
shown in the right graph of Figure 4. This monetary stimulus drives a positive wedge
between the level of output at the stochastic steady state and that at the deterministic
steady state.
It should be noted that if we relax the ZLB constraint, the other non-linearities
in the model would imply a level of output lower than the deterministic steady-state
value. The di¤erence between the two would be increasing in the volatility of the
shock. In the absence of the ZLB constraint, the de‡ationary bias becomes tiny (see
the graph on the left) and therefore the central bank will respond to this by lowering
the interest rate only by a little. Moreover, in this case precautionary motives, which
prompt households to save more to shelter themselves against future risks, become
the driver of the negative long-term output bias. The positive bias due to the lower
bound constraint dominates these e¤ects for our benchmark calibration of the standard
deviation of preference shocks, which is marked by the red star in the plot.
Implications of a Low Natural Interest Rate. The results we have discussed so
far rely on the assumption that the long-run natural rate of interest is …xed and equal
to one percent. Now we show that the combination of a low interest rates environment
and the presence of the zero lower bound gives rise to the de‡ationary bias. Increasing
values of the real rate of interest would mitigate or even completely eliminate the bias
on in‡ation because it would be less likely that monetary policy will become constrained
by the ZLB, as shown in the right plot of Figure 3.
Figure 5 precisely illustrates these results by showing the e¤ects of changing both
the standard deviation of shocks and the long-term real rate of interest r . The important takeaway from this graph is that as the long-term real interest rate r in-

Figure 5: Macroeconomic distortions due the zero lower bound as the standard deviation of preference shocks varies
(x-axis) and for alternative values of the steady-state real rate of interest. Left graph: The in‡ationary bias due to the
zero lower bound constraint. The red star denotes the calibrated value of the standard deviation of this shock. Center
graph: the same as the left graph but the bias is computed with respect to output (level). Right graph: the same as
the left graph but the bias is computed with respect to the real interest rate. Units: In‡ation and real interest bias is
measured in percentage points of annualized rates while the output bias and the standard deviation of the preference
shocks are in percent.

creases su¢ ciently, the long-term in‡ation and output biases disappear. The intuition
is straightforward: when the long-term real interest rate is higher the central bank has
more room to counteract the de‡ationary e¤ects of a contractionary shock and hence
is less likely to become constrained by the zero lower bound (see Figure 3).
It is worth noting that a slightly lower real interest rate r than that of our benchmark calibration can lead to de‡ationary spirals (the gray area). In such an unfavorable
state of the world, the central bank loses control over in‡ation expectations because
the binding ZLB constraint becomes so pervasive that the central bank cannot prevent
in‡ation expectations from being swallowed by the de‡ationary spirals, as shown in
Section 3.
Moreover, a higher real rate of interest r would make the function of the de‡ationary bias less steep and therefore would increase the threshold of the volatility of shocks
that triggers the de‡ationary spirals. It is also interesting to notice that an increase
in the long-term real rate of interest of one percentage point more than halves the
de‡ationary bias in our benchmark calibration, denoted by the red star in the graph.
The size of the bias due to non-linearities in the model other than the ZLB does not
vary with the long-term real interest rate (not shown), suggesting that the long-term
macroeconomic biases linked to a low-interest-rate environment is entirely due to one
speci…c source of non-linearity in the New Keynesian model: the zero lower bound.
To sum up, the de‡ationary bias brought about by the presence of the ZLB can
generate …rst-order distortions for a central bank that tries to stabilize in‡ation around
20

the target. Furthermore, we noticed that the combination of a low long-term real
interest rate, r , and moderate macroeconomic risk can trigger the long-run bias in
in‡ation and output or, even worse, de‡ationary spirals.
The Unconditional Bias The previous section has shown that even when the economy is at the stochastic steady-state equilibrium and thus away from the zero lower
bound, a de‡ationary bias arises because of the risk of encountering the zero lower
bound in the future. This, in turn, triggers a bias in the real interest rate, as the central bank tries to lift in‡ation closer to the target and drives a wedge between actual
output and optimal output. While the de‡ationary bias can be de…ned and measured
within the context of a structural model, it cannot be directly measured in the data.
A concept of de‡ationary bias that can be observed more directly in the data is the
unconditional de‡ationary bias, which we de…ne as the di¤erence between the model’s
unconditional mean of in‡ation and in‡ation at the deterministic steady-state equilibrium (i.e., the central bank’s in‡ation target ). This alternative concept of gap does
not only re‡ect the risk of hitting the ZLB but it also re‡ects the in‡ation outcomes
observed when ZLB episodes actually materialize. As such, the unconditional de‡ationary gap is more closely related to the bias shown in Figure 1 than the concept used
in the previous section.
To compute the unconditional in‡ation bias, we simulate the model for several
periods and then compute the mean of the variables of interest. Figure 6 reports the
average bias as the volatility of the preference shock varies. The bias is computed by
taking the mean of in‡ation, output, and the real interest based on a simulation lasting
1,000,000 periods. We drop the …rst 100,000 observations to minimize the e¤ects of
initial conditions. The biases are reported on the same scale used in Figure 4.
The unconditional de‡ationary bias is even larger than the de‡ationary bias shown
in Figure 4. When computing the unconditional bias, the zero lower bound is not
a mere possibility, but an event that occasionally occurs and, in fact, depresses the
dynamics of in‡ation. Thus, average in‡ation is even further away from the desired
in‡ation target because the economy experiences the de‡ationary pressures associated
with the ZLB period.
This behavior of in‡ation seems consistent with what is reported in Figure 1. In
the late 1990s, the conquest of US in‡ation was completed. The central bank was
successful in convincing agents about the 2% in‡ation target. In terms of the model,

Figure 6: Average macroeconomic biases as the volatility of the preference shock varies. The bias is computed by taking
the mean of in‡ation, output, and the real interest based on a simulation lasting 1,000,000 periods. We drop the …rst
100,000 observations to minimize the e¤ects of initial conditions. The biases are reported on the same scale used in
Figure 3.

this event can be captured as convergence toward the stochastic steady state associated
with a 2% in‡ation target. Such a low target, combined with the low natural rate of
interest leads to a de‡ationary bias
even if the zero lower bound is not binding
and causes in‡ation to drift down and away from the desired 2% target. In fact, during
those years the Federal Reserve was genuinely concerned about the risk of de‡ation
(Krugman 2003). With the 2008 recession, the ZLB risk materialized. The model
predicts in this case a further reduction in in‡ation, as in the data. Finally, as the
economy recovers, the model predicts that in‡ation does not return to a 2% target,
but it stabilizes around a lower value corresponding to the stochastic steady state.
When it comes to the behavior of output and the real interest rate, the bias is
largely gone. When looking at the average bias for the real interest rate, there is a
countere¤ect that pushes the bias to be positive. This countere¤ect is brought about
by the presence of the ZLB itself that truncates the left tail of the distribution of
the nominal interest rate. Thus, the negative bias that arises away from the zero
lower bound is compensated by the fact that at the zero lower bound the central bank
cannot further lower the interest rate, making the e¤ective real interest rate too high.
Importantly, the two phenomena are just the two sides of the same coin: The negative
bias away from the zero lower bound is generated by the de‡ationary pressure that
arises exactly because at the zero lower bound the central bank is not able to lower the
interest rate to mitigate the fall in in‡ation.

22

5

The Asymmetric Rule

We have shown that the de‡ationary bias induced by the ZLB increases when the
natural interest rate r declines or macroeconomic volatility rises. We now turn our
attention to what the central bank can do to address the de‡ationary bias.

5.1

The Policy Proposal

In the academic literature and in policy circles, there has been an ample discussion
about the possibility of increasing the in‡ation target as a way to avoid the perils of
the zero lower bound. An increase in the target would reduce the possibility of hitting
the zero lower bound and the associated bias, as shown by Coibion et al. (2012) and
Nakata and Schmidt (2016). However, Nakamura et al. (2018) show that standard
models are unreliable when it comes to assess the welfare implications for the optimal
in‡ation target. Moreover, policymakers have been quite reluctant to reconsider the
target of in‡ation because they fear losses of reputation and argue that higher in‡ation
is historically associated with more volatile in‡ation. Another line of research has
proposed price or nominal GDP targeting or average-in‡ation targeting (Mertens and
Williams 2019). However, such policies are perceived as risky because they may require
the central bank to engineer a de‡ation over certain periods of time.
In this paper, we are advocating a di¤erent approach that does not require the
central bank to explicitly aim at hitting a time-varying in‡ation target. The central
bank can commit to react less aggressively to positive deviations of in‡ation from target
than to negative deviations. We will show that embracing this asymmetric strategy
can e¤ectively remove the macroeconomic biases.
The policy strategy that we propose implies a smaller response to in‡ation when
in‡ation is above target. Speci…cally, we consider the following modi…ed policy rule:

function that is equal to one when in‡ation is below target ( t < ). In what follows,
we set
= 2 as in the benchmark calibration of Section 2.2 and study how the average
and stochastic steady state biases vary in response to changes in .

Figure 7: Macroeconomic biases due to the ZLB constraint as the central bank varies its response to positive deviations
of in‡ation from target. The in‡ation bias (left plot), the output bias (center plot), and the real interest rate bias
(the right plot) are computed by taking the di¤erence between these variables at the stochastic steady state and their
value at the deterministic steady state (blue solid line). These biases are also computed as the di¤erence between the
unconditional mean of these three variables and their value at the deterministic steady state (red dashed-dotted line).
The response when in‡ation is below target is always equal to 2 as in the benchmark calibration. The red star marks
the symmetric case in which the central bank responds with equal strength to in‡ation or de‡ation. Units: The in‡ation
and the real interest rate biases are expressed in annualized percentage points and the output gap in percentage points.

The asymmetric rule in equation (10) can be interpreted as a strategy according
to which the central bank promises to be slower in raising the rates when in‡ation
goes above target. This strategy reduces the risk of encountering the zero lower bound
and its undesirable e¤ects. It is therefore particularly e¤ective in a low interest rates
environment, like the current one, in which the biases on key macroeconomic variables
can be sizable.
Figure 7 shows how the macroeconomic distortions due to the zero lower bound vary
as the central bank promises to be less aggressive when in‡ation is above its target. We
examine the behavior of the bias away from the zero lower bound (stochastic steady
state, blue solid line) and its unconditional mean (black dashed line). The red stars
denote the distortion under a symmetric rule with a response to in‡ation equal to two,
as in the benchmark calibration.
We observe that being less aggressive when in‡ation is above target helps to mitaround 1.5, the ZLB-driven
igate all the three biases. Speci…cally, for a response
macroeconomic distortions become negligible. In a nutshell, to remove the macroeconomic distortions due to the ZLB constraint, policymakers need to be willing to
tolerate in‡ation above the target for longer periods of time. By raising the long-run
in‡ation expectations, the asymmetric strategy also makes the de‡ationary spirals less
likely to happen. Graphically, this makes the gray areas in Figure 4 smaller. This is
an important point to which we will return in Section 5.3.

24

It is worth emphasizing that this policy e¤ectively reduces the probability of hitting
the ZLB. This is re‡ected in the reduction of the distance between the in‡ation target
(deterministic steady state) and the stochastic steady state of in‡ation. As explained
above, in this case, the economy is currently away from the zero lower bound. The
reduction in the bias is therefore a result of a lower risk of hitting the zero lower bound
in the future.
The Asymmetric Strategy Is Not a Makeup Strategy The asymmetric strategy
proposed in this paper removes the de‡ationary bias because raises the probability of
in‡ation on the upside and, in doing so, o¤sets the downside risk due to the ZLB. Hence,
our strategy di¤ers from the so-called makeup strategies (e.g., price-level targeting, and
average in‡ation targeting) that correct the de‡ationary bias by committing the central
bank to overheat the economy after the ZLB episodes. Consequently, makeup strategies
rely on history dependence which it is often argued makes these strategies hard
to communicate to the public.
While both approaches require the central bank to make some sort of commitment,
the nature of the commitment is very di¤erent. The asymmetric strategy commits the
central bank to respond asymmetrically to current deviations of in‡ation from the central bank’s target with no account for the past dynamics of in‡ation. The asymmetric
strategy never requires the central bank to engineer an overshooting in in‡ation. In
Appendix C, this important property of the asymmetric strategy is illustrated using
a simulation exercise. The challenges in communicating the asymmetric strategy are
discussed in the next section.

Figure 8 shows welfare Wt (left axis) and the in‡ation bias (right axis). As the central bank deviates from the symmetric strategy (the red star) by lowering the response
to above-target in‡ation, welfare increases. When this response is around 1.6, the welfare peaks and then it declines as the response to positive in‡ation deviations from

Inflation Response above Target

Figure 8: Welfare and in‡ation bias as the response to positive deviations of in‡ation from target varies in magnitude.
Welfare is evalutated at the stochastic steady state and reported on the left axis. The in‡ation bias is de…ned as
the di¤erence between the annualized percentage rate of in‡ation at the stochastic steady state and the annualized
percentage rate of in‡ation at the deterministic steady state and is reported on the right axis.

target is further decreased. It should be noticed that to close the de‡ationary bias, the
central bank has to respond more weakly to in‡ation than optimal. The asymmetric
strategy that completely removes the de‡ationary bias, is suboptimal in that it allows
too large and persistent positive deviations of in‡ation from the central bank’s target.
To see this, note that the optimal asymmetric rule solves the following trade-o¤. On
the one hand, by tolerating some persistent positive deviations of in‡ation from its
target the central bank manages to mitigate the de‡ationary bias. On the other hand,
the central bank allows larger positive deviations of in‡ation from its target.
Opportunistic Re‡ation Announcing that the central bank will respond less aggressively to in‡ation when in‡ation will be above target is time inconsistent if this
announcement is made when in‡ation is below target. Therefore, the central bank
needs an opportunity to show the public its commitment to the new asymmetric rule.
The arrival of a shock that pushes in‡ation above target is such an opportunity. We call
this scenario opportunistic re‡ation. We now investigate the implications for welfare
and the macroeconomic outcomes of a central bank pursuing an opportunistic re‡ation.
Let us assume that the economy is initially at the stochastic steady state associated
with the symmetric rule when it gets hit by a positive preference shock that boosts
consumption and aggregate demand. The central bank receives now the opportunity to
show to the private sector that it is willing to commit to the optimal asymmetric rule by
responding less aggressively to the in‡ation consequences of this shock. It is assumed
that by observing the muted response to in‡ation, the private sector immediately
believes that the central bank will follow the asymmetric rule forever.

Figure 9: The dynamics of welfare, the output gap, and the in‡ation gap after a two-standard-deviation positive
preference shock hits the economy in period 1. Two cases are reported: the case in which the central bank adopts the
optimal asymmetric rule and conducts an opportunistic re‡ation of the economy (solid blue line) and the case in which
the central bank does not take this opportunity and sticks to the symmetric rule (red dashed-dotted line). In both
cases, the economy is initialized at its stochastic steady state. Units: In‡ation gap is measured in percentage points of
annualized rates while the output bias is expressed in percentage points.

In Figure 9, we show the impulse response function of welfare and the macroeconomic gaps (in‡ation and output) to a two standard deviation positive preference
shock under the symmetric rule and under the optimal asymmetric rule. The output
gap is measured in deviations from the ‡exible price economy whereas the in‡ation
gap is expressed in deviations from the central bank’s two-percent target. The optimal
asymmetric rule raises the output and in‡ation gaps in the short run relative to the
symmetric rule whereas it mitigates the macroeconomic gaps in the longer run. Welfare
is reported in the left graph of Figure 9, which shows that the optimal asymmetric rule
raises welfare both in the short run and in the longer run.
Why is welfare higher in every period when the central bank adopts the asymmetric
rule even though this rule causes output and in‡ation gaps to widen more at the
beginning? Welfare does not depend only on the current in‡ation and output gaps but
it is also a¤ected by the expected discounted stream of welfare gains that will be accrued
over time. The short-term responses of social welfare to a two-standard-deviation
positive preference shock implies that the long-term welfare gains associated with the
mitigation of the macroeconomic biases outweigh the short-term welfare losses.10
The opportunistic re‡ation involves a trade-o¤ between short-term and long-term
macroeconomic stabilization. Hence, a myopic central bank may refrain from seizing
10

Under the asymmetric rule, the weaker systematic response to in‡ation raises agents’ long-run
uncertainty about in‡ation and hence, everything else being equal, lowers welfare in the long-run.
However, in our model these losses are dominated by the gains from removing the de‡ationary bias.

The left plot of Figure 10 shows the myopic central bank’s welfare gains from carrying
out an opportunistic re‡ation following a positive preference shock as the size of the
shock varies. The gains are computed by taking the di¤erence of the welfare under
the asymmetric rule and welfare under the benchmark symmetric rule at the time the
in‡ationary shock hits the economy. The level of asymmetry is the one we …nd to
be optimal for the non-myopic central banker. The di¤erent lines are associated with
four degrees of the central banker’s myopia, which is captured by the relevant horizons
k = 4; 8; and 12 quarters. The shorter the horizon k, the more myopic the central
banker. The gains are shown as a function of the size of the shock. The myopic central
banker’s gains decline as the size of the preference shocks increases and, hence, the
short-run response of in‡ation to the shock is more pronounced. The speed of this
decline increases as the myopia of the central banker becomes less severe.
11

In what follows, a myopic central bank can also be interpreted as a conservative central bank that
cares too much about the short-term in‡ation consequences of its actions.

28

If the relevant horizon is less or equal than four quarters (k 4), gains are negative
for all positive shock sizes. Such high levels of myopia dissuade the central bank from
seizing the opportunity of re‡ating the economy as the policymaker is more allured
by the short-run welfare gains, which stem from mitigating the immediate in‡ationary
consequences of the shock. If the myopic central bank has a horizon of two years, it will
opportunistically re‡ate the economy if the standard deviation of preference shocks is
lower than two. Lower degrees of myopia (higher k) lead the central bank to carry
out the opportunistic re‡ation even when the magnitude of the shock is large and the
likely short-run in‡ationary consequences of the shock are considerable.
The right plot of Figure 10 shows the welfare gains from opportunistic re‡ation for
the case of the non-myopic/benevolent central banker (k ! 1). In this case, the
optimal asymmetric rule dominates the symmetric rule if the size of the shock is less
than 6 times the calibrated standard deviations of the shocks (i.e., 100 d = 1:175). We
consider this value as fairly high, which suggests that opportunistic re‡ation increases
the economy’s welfare by removing the de‡ationary bias, as long as the central bank
internalizes the long term bene…ts of the policy.
Finally, if no opportunity to rein‡ate the economy occurs, the central bank can
implement the asymmetric strategy by cutting the rate more aggressively when in‡ation
is below target. This action shows to the public that the central bank has credibly
adopted an asymmetric strategy. Appendix D shows that this alternative asymmetric
strategy also removes the de‡ationary bias by lowering the probability of hitting the
ZLB.

5.3

Asymmetric Rules and De‡ationary Spirals

As already discussed in Section 4, adopting an asymmetric strategy does not only remove the de‡ationary bias but it also lowers the risk for the economy of experiencing
de‡ationary spirals. Since in our model parameters are …xed, welfare is not directly
a¤ected by this risk. Nevertheless, falling into a de‡ationary spiral may be very costly
for the economy. The gray areas in Figure 11 denote the values of the standard deviation of preference shocks (upper panels) and the values of the long-term real interest
rate (lower panels) that trigger the de‡ationary spirals for any given above-target response to in‡ation (left panels) and for any given below-target response to in‡ation
(right panels). The bigger the asymmetry in the parameters of the rule, the bigger the
macroeconomic uncertainty (the smaller the real rate of interest) has to be to trigger

de‡ationary spirals. This is because asymmetric rules make the risk of encountering
the ZLB lower.
Mertens and Williams (2019) study a rule according to which the Federal Reserve
enforces an upper bound on the federal funds rate to resolve the de‡ationary bias. This
rule, while correcting the bias, would imply an increase in the probability of de‡ationary
spirals because e¤ectively monetary policy becomes passive when in‡ation goes above
a certain level. Therefore, such a rule reduces the risk of de‡ationary spirals at the
cost of increasing the risk of triggering in‡ationary spirals. Instead, our asymmetric
rule always implies active responses to in‡ation deviations from the target and hence
does not expose the economy to the risk of indeterminately large increases in in‡ation.

Target Ranges

In a recent meeting, the FOMC focused on two classes of alternative proposals to revisit
the long-run monetary policy framework. The …rst class involves dynamic strategies
that make up for periods of below-target in‡ation. The second class is in line with what
advocated in this paper and it includes “those [strategies] that respond more aggressively to below-target in‡ation than to above-target in‡ation,”(minutes of the FOMC
meeting, September 17–18, 2019). According to the minutes, several FOMC members
also proposed a speci…c way to implement the asymmetric strategy: “In this context,
several participants suggested that the adoption of a target range for in‡ation could
be helpful in achieving the Committee’s objective of 2 percent in‡ation, on average, as
it could help communicate to the public that periods in which the Committee judged
in‡ation to be moderately away from its 2 percent objective were appropriate.” In
what follows, we show that the asymmetric strategy proposed in this paper can in fact
be implemented using target ranges as long as the target range is in itself asymmetric
around the in‡ation objective.
To illustrate this point, we consider the following policy rule:
" "

This policy rule prescribes a di¤erent response to deviations of in‡ation from the objective depending on how far in‡ation is from the desired level. Speci…cally, when
in‡ation is inside the target range [ L ; H ], the central bank adjusts the interest rate
less aggressively than what it does when in‡ation is outside the target range: I < O .12
Such a rule is arguably easy to communicate. For example, if the in-range response
I
is set to zero, the central bank could simply announce that levels of in‡ation inside
the target range are not reason of concern. However, an asymmetric target range is
required to correct the de‡ationary bias.
In the left panel of Figure 12, we …x the in-range response to in‡ation to zero ( I =
0), while keeping the out-of-range response unchanged with respect to the benchmark
case ( O = 2). We then report the target ranges that remove the de‡ationary bias
(the solid blue line). Speci…cally, for each value of the lower bound of the target range,
12

The target range rule could also be expressed in deviations from the boundaries of the target
range. We prefer this formulation because it nests both a standard Taylor rule and the asymmetric
rule presented above.

In-Range Response to Inflation

Figure 12: The target range required to close the de‡ationary bias. The left plot: the blue line shows the lower and
upper bounds of the range that closes the de‡ationary bias when the central bank’s in-range response to in‡ation is zero.
The dashed red line marks the bounds implied by the symmetric target range. The right plot: the blue line shows the
upper bound of the range as the central bank’s in-range response to in‡ation varies on the horizontal axis. The lower
bound of the range is …xed to 2 percent. The vertical red-dashed line is an asymptote that arises when the in-range
response to in‡ation equals the above-target response to in‡ation in the asymmetric rule that removes the de‡ationary
bias.

L,

we report on the y-axis the upper bound, H ; that corrects the de‡ationary bias.
Thus, the u-shaped line reported in the panel represents all the pairs [ L ; H ] such
that the de‡ationary bias is fully corrected.
We start with a lower-bound L equal to 1%. In this case the upper bound needs
to be only slightly larger than 3:5%, implying a modest level of asymmetry around the
2% objective. As the lower bound keeps increasing, the upper bound starts declining,
but the asymmetry always remains. For instance, a target range [1:5%; 2:85%] would
also allow the central bank to remove the de‡ationary bias. To see this, note that the
solid blue curve is always above the red-dashed line that implies a symmetric target
range.
When the lower bound reaches the 2% objective, the upper bound is around 2:7%:
Thus, a target region [2%; 2:7%] is necessary to achieve the 2% objective under the
assumption of an in-range response to in‡ation equal to zero. To understand why,
it is worth emphasizing that a target region with a lower bound equal to the 2%
objective is conceptually very similar to the asymmetric rule presented in Section 5.
When in‡ation is below the objective, the response of the policy rate is strong. When
in‡ation is above the target the response is weaker, but in a piecewise fashion. In fact,
the rule presented in Section 5 can also be thought as a degenerate target range rule
32

in which the upper bound of the target range goes to in…nity. The advantage of the
target range is arguably that it preserves the message that excessively high levels of
in‡ation will not be tolerated.
The gray area of the graph denotes values of the lower bound L that are larger
than the objective 2%. While these target ranges also succeed in eliminating the
de‡ationary bias, we believe that they are less interesting because they are not so
easy to communicate: The target range now excludes the in‡ation objective ( L > ).
Nevertheless, we review this case for completeness. Once the lower bound become larger
than the in‡ation objective, the upper bound of the target range starts increasing again.
This is consistent with the results presented so far. Recall that in order to correct the
de‡ationary bias, a rule needs to feature more tolerance to high in‡ation than to low
in‡ation. When the target range is above the desired objective, higher and higher
levels of in‡ation become progressively acceptable.
The right panel of Figure 12 shows that the amount of asymmetry required to
correct the de‡ationary bias depends on the strength with which the central bank
responds to in‡ation inside the target range. In this exercise, the lower bound of the
target range is …xed to 2%. On the x-axis, we report di¤erent values of the in-range
response to in‡ation I . For each of them, the y-axis reports the upper-bound H
required to remove the de‡ationary bias. When the in-range response is equal to zero,
the upper bound is around 2:7%, implying only a mild level of asymmetry around
the 2% objective: [2%; 2:7%]. However, as the in-range response I increases, the
required level of asymmetry of the target range increases. For example, with an inrange response I equal to 1, the required target range becomes: [2%; 3:06%]. This
pattern accelerates over time and the curve approaches a vertical asymptote. The
level of asymmetry goes to in…nity as the in-range response I approaches 1:47 and
the target range rule collapses to the asymmetric rule of Section 5 that removes the
de‡ationary bias.
Summarizing, a target range can be an e¤ective way to implement an asymmetric
policy strategy. However, the target range needs to be asymmetric around the desired
objective for in‡ation. The extent of the asymmetry depends on the response to in‡ation inside the target range. In the benchmark case of a zero response inside the
range, we show that the range needed to remove the de‡ationary bias is only modestly
asymmetric. A target range also allows the central bank to preserve the message that
excessively high in‡ation will trigger a strong policy response.

Conclusions

In an environment in which monetary policy faces the risk of encountering the zero lower
bound, in‡ation tends to remain persistently below target, even if monetary policy is
not constrained. This is because agents anticipate the possibility of low in‡ation in the
future. We showed that an asymmetric policy strategy eliminates the macroeconomic
biases due to the ZLB. A strategy according to which the central bank reacts less
aggressively to positive deviations of in‡ation from the 2% target than to negative
deviations can e¤ectively remove the macroeconomic biases, improve social welfare,
and reduce the risk for the economy to fall into highly costly de‡ationary spirals.
We argue that convincing agents that the central bank will abandon the old symmetric strategy to embrace the asymmetric one is non-trivial when in‡ation is below
target. Once the central bank has removed the bias by announcing the asymmetric
strategy, it has an incentive to renege on its announcement and to stick to the symmetric rule, which lowers the short-run volatility of in‡ation. A way to address this time
inconsistency is to conduct an opportunistic re‡ation. We show that an opportunistic
re‡ation is welfare improving in a standard New Keynesian model. Nevertheless, the
welfare gains are back-loaded and hence the policymaker needs to be su¢ ciently forward looking to be willing to conduct an opportunistic re‡ation. Finally, we showed
that the asymmetric strategy can be implemented with a target range, as long as the
target range is in itself asymmetric. A target range is arguably easy to communicate
and allows the central bank to preserve the message that excessively high in‡ation will
not be tolerated.

The model is solved with global methods. The agents take the presence of the
zero lower bound into account and form their expectations accordingly. Therefore,
the possibility of hitting the zero lower bound in the future a¤ects potentially the
equilibrium outcome in times of unconstrained monetary policy. We use time iteration
(Coleman 1990 and Judd 1998) with piecewise linear interpolation of policy functions
as in Richter et al. (2014).13 Expectations are calculated using numerical integration
based on Gauss-Hermite quadrature.
The state variable is dt , while the policy variables are t and labor Ht :

where g = (g 1 ; g 2 ) and g i : R1 ! R1 . To solve the model, we approximate the unknown

This approach can handle the non-linearities associated with zero lower bound. Richter et al.
(2014) demonstrate that linear interpolation outperforms Chebyshev interpolation, which is a popular
alternative, for models with zero lower bound. The kink in the policy functions is more accurately
located which gives a more precise solution.

A Model with Binary Realizations of the Shock

In this binary case, we treat the Taylor rule in the good state and all the other remaining
equilibrium equations separately. Using di¤erent candidates of in‡ation for the good
state ( H ), we calculate two nominal interest rates for the good state RH1 ( H ) and
RH2 ( H ). The …rst one stems from the Taylor rule, while the other one results from
the other remaining equations.
The candidate for the nominal interest rate RH1 ( H ) resulting from of the Taylor
rule in the good state reads as follows:

Figure 13: Simulations of in‡ation and nominal interest rate during an arti…cial recession. The economy is at its
stochastic steady state in period 0, 1, and 2. From period 3 through period 8, the economy is hit by a one-standarddeviation negative preference shock in every period. Starting from period 9 no more shocks occur and the economy
evolves back to its stochastic steady-state equilibrium. Units: percentage points of annualized rates.

ically.14 The mapping of H to RH2 corresponds to the blue solid line in Figure 2.
To calculate a hypothetical economy without a zero lower bound in the bad state, we
we assume that the ZLB constraint is not binding in that state. This gives us the
dash-dotted blue line in Figure 2.
An equilibrium for the economy exists for a given in‡ation in the good state H if
RH1 ( H ) = RH2 ( H ). This corresponds to an intersection of the red and the blue line
in Figure 2. Looping over H allows to check the existence of equilibria and …nd all
possible solutions of the economy with binary realizations of the preference shock.

C

The Asymmetric Strategy is Not a Makeup Strategy

In this appendix we will show that the asymmetric strategy does not require the central
bank to engineer an overshooting in in‡ation after a ZLB episode as makeup strategies
(e.g., price-level targeting, average in‡ation targeting. etc.) do. To this end, we
simulate the economy under a sequence of negative shocks large enough to bring the
economy to the zero lower bound for a certain number of periods. We assume that
the central bank is following the asymmetric rule that removes the de‡ationary bias.
14

To handle the kink in the Taylor rule in the low state, we use a guess and verify approach in
practice. First, we solve the whole system assuming that the Taylor rule is not binding in the bad
state. We keep the results if the result does not violate the zero lower bound in the bad state. Then,
we guess that zero lower bound is binding in the bad state and keep the results if this is indeed the
bad-equilibirum outcome.

42

Figure 13 shows the path for the endogenous variables in the three cases. We assume
that the economy is initially at its stochastic steady states and the size of the each
shock is one standard deviation. In period 3, a sequence of negative demand shocks
hits the economy. Starting from period 9 no more shocks occur and the economy slowly
goes back to the stochastic steady state.
In the left plot of Figure 13, the ZLB is binding when the negative preference
shocks hit the economy. After the ZLB period, no more shocks hit the economy and
the central bank lifts the nominal interest rate o¤ the ZLB constraint. In the right plot
of Figure 13, the dynamics of in‡ation in the simulation is reported. In‡ation falls as
the economy is hit by the negative preference shocks. As the e¤ects of these shocks fade
away, the in‡ation rate converges to the desired two-percent in‡ation target. Note that
in‡ation converges to the desired target from below because the central bank does not
try to overshoot its in‡ation target as it would have done if it had adopted a makeup
strategy.

D

Strategic Interest Rate Cuts

We showed that if the central bank seizes the opportunity of re‡ating the economy by
adopting an asymmetric rule after an in‡ationary shock arises, social welfare generally
increases. If no opportunity to re‡ating the economy arises, the central bank can still
remove the de‡ationary bias and improves welfare by cutting more aggressively the
interest rate if in‡ation is below target while clarifying that the response to in‡ation
above target is unchanged.
This alternative asymmetric rule also eliminates the macroeconomic biases. The
upper panels of Figure 14 report the behavior of the macroeconomic biases de…ned with
respect to the stochastic steady state (blue solid lines) and the observable averages
(red dashed lines) as the response to below-target in‡ation, , varies. The response
to positive deviations of in‡ation from the target is the same as in the symmetric rule
= 2)
( = 2). The red star denotes the distortions under a symmetric rule ( =
as in the baseline calibration. The response to in‡ation below target that zeroes the
biases is approximately three.
The e¤ects of adopting this asymmetric rule on the probability of hitting the ZLB
and the frequency of ZLB episodes is ambiguous ex ante. On the one hand, lowering
more vigorously the nominal interest rate to …ght against de‡ationary pressures could

Figure 14: Macroeconomic biases due to risk of hitting ZLB under the asymmetric rule. The biases are computed
relatively to the stochastic steady state (blue solid line) or the average in‡ation (red dashed-dotted line) and are shown
in the upper panels. The output gap is expressed in percentage points and in‡ation gap is expressed in percentage
points of annualized rates. The lower panels show the risk of hitting the ZLB in the next period (left) and the expected
frequency of the ZLB (right) as the response to in‡ation below target varies. The frequency is in percentage points
and it is computed as the ratio between the number of periods spent at the zero lower bound and the total sample size
(300,000). The probability of hitting the zero lower bound in the next period is conditional on being at the stochastic
steady state in the current period and is expressed in percentage points.

increase the probability of hitting the zero lower bound. On the other hand, committing to respond more aggressively to negative deviations of in‡ation from target
eliminates the de‡ationary bias and thereby raises the long-term nominal interest rate.
Higher nominal rates cause the likelihood of hitting the ZLB to fall. As shown in the
lower panels of Figure 14, the asymmetric rule that allows the central bank to remove
the macroeconomic bias ( = 3) lowers the probability of hitting the ZLB and the
expected frequency of ZLB episodes.
