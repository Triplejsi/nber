Introduction
In 1985, the 50 states raised $349 billion in revenues from their own

sources, and received $84 billion in grants from the federal government.

impact on

One important determinant of a state's ability to conduct

reasonable fiscal policies is the quality of its revenue forecasts. Sensible
deliberations about expenditures cannot be made in the absence of "good"
forecasts.

Indeed, in the presence of constitutional or statutory provisions

for balanced budgets, unanticipated changes in revenues can wreak havoc not
only on proposals that are scheduled for funding, but on plans that have
already been put into effect as well.

Basic Concepts
State revenue forecasters operate

an environment characterized by

great uncertainty. Future revenues generated by a given revenue structure
depend on future values of variables like employment, population, and nominal
income,

none of which is easy to predict.

Additional uncertainty is created

by the fact that the state tax structure itself may be changed in the
future.

Such changes depend in part on the political climate in the state,

Therefore, the forecast error (Rt

Suppose now that only a subset of 't—f Is utilized in making the
prediction.

If this subset Is used efficiently, then the forecast is said to

be weakly rational. That is, even if all information is not fully utilized,
the forecaster gets the correct answer on average.

Hence, a test of weak

There are conflicting views with respect to whether revenue predictions
are unbiased, and if not, whether revenues are over or underpredicted. Klay
[1983, p. 308] argues that the forecasts

are systematically too low:

organizations; Massachusetts does not.)

Indeed,

it could also be argued that

incentives

to forecast rationally. The present and former state budget

officials with whom we spoke claimed that they did their best to be on
target.

Interestingly, they stated that unexpected surpluses are just about

as bad as deficits from their point of view.

When there is an unexpected

surplus, much of the extra revenue goes to localities.

While the localities

are happy to receive the new money, they are Irked that they have to re-do
their planning,

and resent the fact that they were not given correct figures

at the outset.

Budget officials also emphasized the fact that the newspapers

point out forecast errors very aggressively, whether they are negative or
positive.

Background and Data

The Budgetary Process

New Jersey.

The last week of every January the Governor of New Jersey

submits to the legislature a budget statement that includes forecasts of
revenues and expenditures.5 The forecast for each item is made over two time
horizons.

The first, which we call the short forecast,

is for the fiscal

The second, which we call the

forecast, is for the fiscal year beginning the subsequent July 1.

Hence, the

short forecast presented in January 1988 covers the period July 1, 1987 to
June 30, 1q88; the long forecast contained in that message is for July 1,
1988 to June 30, 1989.
In most states, forecasts are made by a budget division within the
executive branch (Hyde and Jarocki [1983,
lies with the governor,

p. 266]).

The final responsibility

who reviews the forecasts, and can modify them before

presentation. New Jersey is typical in these respects.

Legal

responsibility

for revenue estimation resides with the Governor and the Director of Budget
and Accounting.

However, the forecasts are developed in consultation with a

number of offices in the executive branch, particularly the various tax
bureaus.
The forecasting process begins in the October precedIng the budget

address, and a set of figures is produced by November.

However, these

figures are usually revised once or twice before the budget message goes to
press in January.
Revenue forecasting methods differ widely across the states.

Some

states rely on econometric models, others on much more Informal methods. In
the early 197Os Glovinazzo [1971, p. 27] noted that in New Jersey
"formalized, systematic techniques are seldom, if ever, used."

6

Rather than

using econometric models, forecasters

used a 'judgmental approach--they

informally analyzed past trends in different revenue sources, and relied
heavily on the expertise of members of the various tax bureaus.

Our

conversations with current and recent budget officials indicated that this is
still pretty much the case.

These officials indicated that attempts at

econometric modelling generally led to disappointing results, and that It was
better to rely on the advice of 'old hands" who had a good sense of what was
really going on in the state.

Revenue forecasts are made entirely In—house;

Massachusetts. The Massachusetts institutions are very similar to those
of New Jersey.

Revenue estimates are prepared each November,

and forwarded

to the Governor, who presents them during the last week of the following
January. These estimates are prepared by the Bureau of Administration and
Finance

(B,A&F).

Formal econometric modelling plays a somewhat greater role

than it does in New Jersey.

Specifically,

BA&F receives econometric

forecasts for Massachusetts generated by a consulting firm (Data Resources,
Inc.), and then plugs these forecasts

into a micro simulation model based on

Massachusetts tax returns. However, all forecasts are subject to the
judgment of "old hands," and some revenue sources are forecast without any
formal modelling at all.

Corporate income taxes were offered as an example

where familiarity with individual cases was sufficiently important that

forecasts.

Estimates of state revenues in Maryland are developed through

a process that Is similar to the processes of New Jersey and Massachusetts.

Revenue forecasting is carried out by the Bureau of Revenue Estimates (BRE)
under the supervision of the State Comptroller, Treasurer, and Secretary of
Budget and Fiscal Planning.

The Governor receives the estimates in

7

mid—December and incorporates them into his budget message which

is presented

to the state legislature in mid-January.
The use of econometric forecasting techniques appears to be more
prevalent in Maryland than in either New Jersey or Massachusetts. Regression
models have been utilized In forecasting state revenues in Maryland since the
early 1970s.

The models tend to be quite simple——generally there are fewer

than three explanatory variables for each revenue source, and estimation is
by ordinary least squares. While revenue forecasting models are developed
entirely in—house, BRE officials depend significantly on outside econometric
forecasting services for the information on which the models are based.

Such

services provide forecasts of various explanatory variables such as state
personal income.

As of 1987, econometric methods were applied to revenue

sources that comprised 87.5% of Maryland tax revenues.
Of course, the unvarnished regression output is not included in the
governor's message-—quite a few modifications are made.

Nevertheless, it

will be of some interest to see whether the heavier reliance on econonietrics
leads to more accurate forecasts.

The budgetary data are from the budget messages of February

1948 through January 1987.

the 1930s, there appears to have been a change in accounting conventions
after World War II that made it difficult to construct a coherent time series.

reason and for purposes of simplicity, we aggregated all revenues into two

Except

for lagged revenue, each variable Is available on a calendar year basis.7
This leads to a complication in answering the "when" part of the question.
Given that the forecasts are made before the calendar year is entirely over,
it is not clear whether variables dated that year should be included in the

of revenue grew at faster rates In Maryland than their counterparts in New
Jersey and Massachusetts. (Recall, however, that the time periods over which
the averages are taken differ somewhat across the states as do the

definitions of "own revenues.")

With respect to forecasts of own source

revenues, the qualitative picture is much the same as that for New Jersey and
Massachusetts——on average, revenues are underforecast, and there has been
some tendency for the absolute value of the forecast errors to fall over
time.

As is also the case in New Jersey and Massachusetts, grants play an
important role to state public finance.

In 1987,

the ratio of grant to

non—grant revenues was about 24 percent; it has been as high as 31 percent.
However, Table ic indicates

that unlike New Jersey and Massachusetts, in

Maryland predictions of grants are too optimistic on average.

Moreover,

using any method for measuring the errors, the grants forecasts are much
worse than In New Jersey and Massachusetts. Closer investigation of the data
indicated that these results are dominated by several years in the mid—1970s,
when the forecast rate of growth of grants exceeded the actual by as much as

We do not regard these results as "proof" that econometric forecasting
methods are useless--it could be that Maryland implements these methods
poorly,

and/or that the results are ignored by political decision-makers,

and/or that for some reason revenues have become Intrinsically more difficult
to forecast since 1973, so that in the absence of econometric methods, the
results would have been worse.

Still, on the basis of these results, one

would have to be cautious about urging states to fire their "old hands" and
replace them with computers.
Turning now to the grants forecasts,

we see that unlike New Jersey and

Massachusetts, weak rationality is rejected.

This finding is not altogether

surprising given the discussion surrounding Table ic.

rejected weak rationality for own revenues, we expect that strong rationality

V.

Conclusion
This paper has suggested a framework for examining whether state revenue

forecasts are formed rationally, and used this framework to analyze budget
data from New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Maryland. The states are remarkably
similar in several ways:

a) on average the forecasts of the growth of own

revenues have fallen short of actual growth;

b) there has been some tendency

for the forecasts of own revenues to improve over time, but the improvement
is generally not statistically significant;

Their underestimation will

neither restrain legislative spending in a way that might be desired by the
executive, nor provide the executive with "unexpected" surpluses out of which
to fund favored programs.1° As we noted earlier, the time series on grants
forecasts for Maryland is dominated by several large outliers in the
mid-1970s. Of course,

it is illegitimate to discard outliers from a time

series, and we have not done so.

Still,

our

guess is that if the grants

forecasts of other states are analyzed, they will tend to be more like those
of New Jersey and Massachusetts than those of Maryland.11
We also found that Maryland's more extensive use of econometric methods
does not seem to have produced results much different than those of New
Jersey and Massachusetts. However, data on more states are required to test
carefully whether differences in state budgetary methods and institutions
affect the quality of revenue forecasts.
