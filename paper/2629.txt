Introduction

I.

The recent behavior of the external sector in a number of countries,
the United States, has generated concern among policymakers

academics.

and

In fact, in the last few years policy analyses have increasingly

focused on issues related to the evolution of the trade and current
accounts,

and some proposals aimed at altering some countries external posi-

tions have been intensively discussed.

Perhaps one of the most hotly

debated policy measures consists of the imposition of (temporary) import
tariffs as a way of improving the internal terms of trade and, thus, a

it has become customary to emphasize

have in practice ignored this proposition and have proceeded

along the lines of traditional static textbook models.

Also, a number of

applied papers have recently discussed the effects of tariffs on current
account behavior without acknowledging

any interremporal

factors.

On the

other hand, many of the papers that have explicitly used an inttrtemporsl

setting have either used ad-hoc assumptions regarding consumers or
producers,

or have only considered a two-goods world, being unable to deal

with the effects of import tariffs on the real exchange rare.3
II.

The Model

In this section a real general equilibrium intertemporal model of a
small open economy is derived to analyze the way in which different
disturbances affect the current account.

The model is based on Edwards

(1988c) and extends in several directions the intertemporal

models of

Given the nature of preferences, the consumer optimization process can
be thought of as taking place in two stages.

First, the consumer decides

Under the

of homotheticity and separability these price indexes correspond

to unit expenditure functions (Svensson and Razin, 1983)

In models such as the ones developed by Svensson and Razin (1933), Razin and

Concluding Remarks
In this paper I have developed an intertemporal, fully optimizing model

of a small open economy with nontradable goods to analyze how temporary
terms of trade shocks affect the current account.

changes,
