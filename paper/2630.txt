I. Introduction
In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the analysis of smuggling as

an economic phenomenon.' The seminal paper in this area is by Bhagwati and Hansen
[1973), who examined the welfare effects of smuggling under perfect competition and
monopoly in a two good trade model. They found that smuggling would necessarily reduce

welfare only when smuggling coexisted with legal trade. This spawned a series of articles
which, to a large extent, dealt with when the coexistence of legal trade and smuggling
could be welfare increasing. By introducing a third non-tradedgood, Sheikh [1974] showed

that smuggling which coexisted with legal trade could be welfare improving. Pitt [1981]
and Martin and Panagariya [1984] obtained the same result by allowing legal trade to
coexist

with smugglingwhen firms

camouflage their illegal trade by importing some goods

legally.

The appeal of these recent papers

is

that they focus on the microeconomic

foundations of the two types of trade coexisting. Pitt's contributionwas to show that when
competitive firms smuggle by camouflaging, the condition for zero profits in long run
equilibrium implies a price disparity2 (i.e. a domestic price of imports lower than the

tariff inclusive world

price).

The model of Martin and Panagariya is particularly

important because it explicitly introduces the uncertain nature of smuggling into the
individual firm's decision problem and shows that the first order conditions for profit
maximization require a price disparity when the probability the firm will
smuggling is a function of the amount

it trades

be detected

legally. The Bhagwati-Hansen (BH) type

of coexistence without price disparity is shown to follow when the

probability of detection

depends only on the total amount smuggled.
One of the shortcomings of the Pitt and Martin and Panagariya (hereafter P-MP
models) is

that

pure legal traders

are driven out of the market

when smugglingoccurs. At

the other extreme, BH type of smuggling allowe each firm to either smuggle or trade
legally (but not both).

This leaves unexplained the intermediate case

of

camouflaged

smugglingby some, but not all, firms in a market.3 This case is more than a theoretical
curiosity. For example, commercial smuggling of cigarettes from low tax to high tax
states for sale in legal retail or vending outlets has been a problem in the United States.

In

1975 ten

states reported this type

of smuggling

as their most

serious cigarette tax

evasion problem [ACIR, 1977, p. 10], and the revenue loss to state and local governments
in high tax states from cigarette tax evasion was estimated to be $391 million per year
[ACIR, 1977, p. 1]. The Federal Contraband Cigarette Act of 1978 was enacted because

the problem with commercial smuggling was considered so widespread. It seems unlikely,
however,

that

all legal outlets were selling contraband cigarettes. Another example of

camouflaged smugglingis misweighing or misinvoicing

of imports te avoid custems dutiea.

There is no reason, a priori, to expect all importers te do this.

In this paper we model

imports and drives the domestic price in equilibrium down to the level that would prevail
under pure competition. The model allows the coexistence of camoufiagers and legal
traders, but in the limiting case of pure competition it can be shown te be equivalent te the
P-MI' type models. This has the advantage of allowing us

te examine how market

structure, as well as enforcement, affect smuggling and welfare. The major results are:
(1)

that the price disparity that occurs in models where

smuggled

trade is camouflaged is

directly related to the degree of competition in the importing industry; (2) since this price
disparity is welfare improving, ceteris paribus, the welfare effect of smugglingin the model
is directly related to the degree of competition as well; and, (3) since the quantity imported
by

a camouflager exceeds that of a legal trader, ceteris pan bus, an increase in enforcement

may reduce welfare even when enforcement is costless. These results differ markedly
from welfare comparisonsarising from coexistence with BH-type smuggling.

3

Sections II

—

VI are theoretical. Because the literature related to our work focuses

on smugglingacross national boundaries, the discussion in these sections will do so as well.

The model, however, also applies to smugglingacross state lines induced by differential tax
rates, and our empirical analysis will focus on such a case. In Section VII we show that
13.5. cigarette sales for 1975—82 are consistent with our model of camouflaged smuggling.

all e.
However, there is an additionalcost to attempting to smuggle which is paid whether

the firm is successfulor not. This cost could be a real cost (from society's point of view)
such as the cost of special packaging or a payment to foreign suppliers to misinvoice, or it
could be

a transfer

such as a bribe to a customs official to misweigh

or to "look the other

way." In general, we would expect this excess cost to vary across firms.4

Those firms

whose managers have more experience are more likely to have established ties with
suppliers or officials and, hence, lower fees. Similarly, they may have better information
regarding the type of enforcement activity so that packaging effort, and therefore cost,
may differ. The same arguments would hold for managers with familial ties to suppliers
and/or officials.

To allow

for such differences among firms, we specify a firm specific

parameter, y, which with e determines the excess cost of attempting to smuggle. For
simplicity,

we assume the total excess cost of smugglingis given by

increase in the number of legal traders has

an ambiguous effect on the price disparity.

Nevertheless,under the conditions stated, an equal increase in the number of camoufiagers
and legal traders will cause an increase in the price disparity. Even if an increase in the
number of legal traders does reduce the price disparity, ceteris paribus,

a corresponding

increase in the number of camoufisgers will more than offset that effect and the price
disparity will increase.
The intuition behind results

is straightforward. With entry, the

marginal revenue of a legal trader and the expected marginal revenue of a camoufiager

positive estimates will it be clear that smuggling through camouflagingis occurring, and in
this case all firms are smuggling.
VI. Competition

and Welfare

The existence of a price disparity in the model leads to the possibility that smuggling

relative to legal trade can be welfare improving. As in Pitt, when the excess smuggling
cost is merely a transfer to the government,then smugglingimproves welfare via the price
disparity. The results of the last section indicate that this welfare improvement is
maximized when there is free entry of camoufiagers. If, on the other hand, there is

a real

excess smuggling cost, the welfare effect of smugglingdepends on the relative magnitudes

of the

excess cost and lower price due to camouflaging.

Here again, the welfare effect of

smuggling will depend on the degree of competition. While the price disparity is
maximizedwith free entry of camouflagers, free entry will drive up total excess smuggling
cost because entry leads to an increase in the equilibriumquantity firms try to smuggle.
The following propositioncharacterizes the impact of a change in the number of firms on

welfare.

An increase in the number of camouflagers will reduce welfare

In a similar fashion, the

raises price.and leads legal traders to expand imports, but the net effect is fewer total
imports, less smuggling, and a higher price. Welfare is reduced unless the resulting loss in
consumer surplus is offset by a reduction in total excess smuggling cost.

If the fraction

smuggled is inelastic with respect to enforcement, the welfare increase from lower total
excess smuggling cost. (due to the lower fraction smuggled)is not large enough to offset the
loss in consumer surplus. An increase in

shifts the camouflagers' marginal costs up,

causing them to reduce imports with the same effects on equilibrium values, and therefore
welfare, as a change in e.
Finally, it is worth noting why we cannot obtain welfare results for changes in the

tariff and

world price.

Recalling Proposition

5,

an increase in the tariff causes

camouflagers to increase imports and legal traders to decrease imports. Legal traders
reduce imports because their marginal cost shifts up. Camouflagers'marginal cost shifts
up also, but to a lesser extent since they also increase the fraction they try to smuggle.
Increasing the fraction smuggled increases expected marginal revenue enough to outweigh
this effect, so each camouflager expands imports. The net effect on equilibrium total
imports, smuggling, and the price are uncertain. Although the effects of an increase in the
world price are very similar to those of an increase in the tariff, we cannot determine how
any equilibrium values change when p changes. The difference is that

an increase in t

increases camouflagers' marginal cost only through their legal imports, while an increase
in p' increases marginal cost through legal and illegal imports.

All

we consider situations where

this assumption may not be warranted.
An obvious example is where governments restrict entry through import licenses.
Smuggling is generally regarded

as prevalent in Indonesia, and recent data for Indonesia

show that of 5229 traded commodity classifications, 1484 were under license and only 296

of these were

subject to quotas (Pangestu, [1987]).

1360 of these items were

manufactures such as steel, textiles, machinery, pharmaceuticals, and plastics. A natural
question to ask is whether licensing is merely a technicality, or whether there are indeed
few firms in the market. In the case of polyester and rayon fibers, the government
recently liberalized the licensing procedure so that six state trading companies are allowed
to import fibers rather than the previous sole importer (Pangestu, p.32). The right to
import plastics is restricted to three firms (Pangestu, p. 34).
Interstate cigarette smuggling in the U. S. is another likely candidate for our
model. Different cigarette taxes across states provide the incentive

In Sections

A and B we Locus on the cigarette example. The primary reason is

that price data needed to examine the extent of smuggling are readily available for
cigarettes. We present evidence that camouflaged smuggling is widespread enough to be
statistically significant in a regression framework. Moreover, empirical estimates of price
disparity are consistentwith the view that some, but not all, firms in the market smuggle.
A.

Industry Smuggling Characteristics
Cigarette smuggling practices include consumers crossing state lines for personal

consumption purchases, as well as smuggling of cigarettes by wholesalers and retailers for

resale in retail or vending outlets. While we account for casual smuggling in our empirical
estimates, our interest is primarily in the latter. The exact mechanism for commercial
(organized) smugglingvaries, but it generally involves distributors or retailers in high tax

states purchasing cigarettes from a wholesaler in a low tax state.

paid a premium not to affix any tax indicia to the

cigarettes. The distributor or retailer in the high tax state then uses

a counterfeit tax

stamp to evade the higher tax. Enforcement evidence suggests the bulk of these purchases
are made in North Carolina and some in Kentucky [ACIR, 1977 and 1985].
There are a number of empirical studies of cigarette smuggling. The Advisory
Committee on Intergovernmental Relations [ACIR 1977, 1985] estimated the revenue loss
to high tax states from all forms of cigarette smuggling to be $390 million in 1975. A

demand equation for cigarettes was estimated using data from non-smuggling states and
used to predict cigarette consumption in smuggling states. Comparing the estimates with
legal sales (that is, tax paid cigarette sales) gave

a measure of the extent of

not attempt to differentiate between casual and commercial smuggling. Other studies
finding significantsmugglingeffects are Manchester [1973], Baltagi and Levin [1986], and

Baltagi and Goel [1987]. These studies, like the ACIR study, do not provide evidence on
the extent of casual versus commercial smuggling.

18
Like the ACIR, we examine how the presence of smugghng affects demand

estimation.8 But we differ by using data from smuggling as well as non-smuggling
states, and we account for smuggling with regressors expected to he sensitive to the
different forms of smuggling. To differentiate between the two forms of smuggling, we
rely on the fact that casual smuggling is predominantly consumers crossing into adjoining
low

tax states

to purchase cigarettes from retail outlets while commercial smuggling is

predominantly trucking of large quantities of cigarettes purchased from wholesalers in
North Carolina and, to a lesser extent, Kentucky.
Before turning to our estimation strategy, several additional facts need to be

indeterminant because of other excluded variables when smuggling occurs (enforcement,
etc.) and because of interaction of TAXDIF, the excluded variables, and the demand
variables.
Instrumental variables estimation is used because of possible simultaneity due to

E. Empirical Price Disparity
For some of the states in the sample, cigarettes are primarily smuggled in, while
for others there is no smugglingor cigarettes are smuggled out. In this section, we focus
on price disparity in

states where cigarettes are primarily

smuggled into the state.

Combined with our results on the importance of commercial smuggling, the observed price

disparity can be used to indicate whether all firms are smuggling.
In Section IV we discussed the information contained in the sign

— P.

of observed price

To give empirical content to the measure in the cigarette

case, several adjustments are made in calculating PD. Since the cigarette tax is per unit

rather than ad valorem, the first term in PD is replaced by p" + t.5 For the cigarette
case, pt is the wholesaleprice plus distribution costs and federal excise tax.
Our measure of the cigarette price disparity for the ith in-smuggling

t is

where

state at time

21

WP is the wholesale price at time t (equal for all states)
FT is the federal excise tax (equal to $08 for all observations)
ST is the state tax
D is a measure of distribution cost, and
RP is retail price.
Because direct data

are unavailable, we construct a measure of distribution cost

based on observed markup in states with no in-smuggling. Observed markup for the jth
non-smuggling state is (RPJ — WP — FT — STJ) so that it includes factor costs and
profits. As is appropriate for a state with no smuggling, this measure implies a zero
observed price disparity in the jth State at time

t. Barring differences in factor costs

or

market structure across states, this markup would proxy distribution costs in the absence
of smuggling.

However, factor costs do differ across states, and to account for this we

weight the markup by an index of relative wage rates. Since the primary factor cost in
cigarette retailing is labor,1° we use wage rates of grocery store workers. In (13), then,

WI is the ratio of wage rates in j to those in i.
Ideally we would calculate markup using states not engaged in any form of

smuggling (in or out), but we cannot be certain which (if any) states fall in that catagory.
We initially choose North Carolina and Kentucky as the "base" states since

it is

known

that only out-smuggling occurs there. A second base group is composed of states for which
we have strong priors that no commercial smuggling occurs. States in this group have
state taxes within 10 cents per pack of the North Carolina tax (taxes are averages over
the period and stated in 1982 prices). In all exercises we exclude from considerationstates

We calculated the price

disparity in those states for each of the 8 years in our sample. Using the North Carolina
and Kentucky markup, the price disparity is positive in only 7 of the 48 cases. Using

only 16 cases.
We also examine price disparity for states whose average tax rates were

discriminate between commercial and casual smuggling, but it does capture states with the

greatest incentive

to smuggle (either commercially

or casually). Using the North Carolina-

Kentucky markup base, the price disparity is positive in one-third of the cases. For the

VIII. ConcludingRemarks
BH is the only study prior to this one to examine the welfare effects of smuggling
with varying degrees of competition. This paper provides an analysis of smuggling and
market power when smugglingoccurs through camouflaging. The advantage of the model
is that it includes both the realistic type of smugglingmodelled by P-MP and BH's equally
realistic notion of different firms conducting the two types of trade (i.e. smuggling and
legal trade). We have shown that the coexistence of two types of firms is precluded if and
only

if there is free entry

of firms capable of camouflaging.

In particular,

if the smuggling

technology and enforcementeffort make camouflaging profitable for only a small number
of firms, then even in the long run we could observe some firms trading legally and others
camouflaging.
Unlike BH, however, coexistence in this model can be welfare improving. Here, as

in P-MP. this

is due to

the price disparity implied by the first order conditions for

camouflagers. As one might expect, this disparity and therefore the welfare effects of

23
smuggling are related to the degree of competition in the market. In BH's case of
coexistence (where smugglers do not camouflage), monopoly was preferred to perfect
competition (since with no price disparity "the fewer smugglers, the better" p. 184). Here
we obtain the more conventional result

that welfare

is

higher the more firms there are

whenever there is no real excess smuggling cost. When there is a real excess cost to
smuggling, the welfare effects depend on the

extent to

which increased competition

increases excess smuggling costs.
Finally, we show that observed price disparity with camouflaging can be positive

or negative.

In previous models, camouflaged smuggling produced a positive disparity.

This followed because the analysis was restricted to perfect competition. In a more
general setting, camouflaging can occur with negative observed disparity when not all
firms smuggle. Our empirical evidence on commercial cigarette smuggling in the U.S.
consistent with this being the case.
