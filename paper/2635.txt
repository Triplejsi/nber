SAVINGS PROMOTION, INVESTMENT PROMOTION,
AND INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS

ABSTRACT

In an open economy, savings- and investment-promoting policies may
have very different effects on the capital account and on the viability of
export-oriented and import-competing industries. The nature of the effects
is often ambiguous in analytical models. This paper employs a simulation
model that combines a detailed treatment of industry interactions,
attention to adjustment dynamics, and an integrated treatment of current
and capital account transactions to investigate these effects in both the
short and long run. We focus on the different effects of savings- and
investment-promoting U.S. tax policies on the viability of U.S. export
industries. We compare results under the assumption of no international
capital mobility (and no international asset transactions) with those under
the assumption of full international mobility (which assumes no barriers to
or costs of such transactions). Within the case of capital mobility, we
consider the importance of the degree of international asset
substitutability - - the extent to which individuals respond to differences
in anticipated rates of return by altering their portfolios.
Simulation results show that the impacts on export industries differ
fundamentally depending on the degree of international capital mobility.
In the absence of such mobility, savings- and investment- promoting
policies have similar effects on U.S. export industries, with insubstantial
effects in the short run and larger, beneficial long-run effects that
reflect increases in the productiveness of the U.S. economy. Once
international capital mobility is accounted for, however, the effects of
the two policies differ from one another in both the short and long run.
Subsidizing saving helps U.S. export industries initially but hurts them
over the longer term. The reverse is true for a policy that subsidizes
investment. These differences, which are robust across a range of model
specifications and parameter assumptions, stem from the very different
implications of the two types of policies for the capital account of the
balance of payments.

Introduction

In recent years, discussions of U.S. tax policy have been taking on an

increasingly international flavor. As participants in tax policy debates
have become more concerned with the international economic environment and
with the competitive difficulties of U.S. import-competing and
export-oriented industries, many have concluded that changes in capital
income taxation, at both the personal and corporate levels, are essential
to restoring the competitiveness of U.S. industry in the international
marketplace.

This growing attention to international considerations is a natural

consequence of the increasing openness of the U.S. economy. Openness poses
a challenge to tax policy analysts, who traditionally have relied on

closed-economy frameworks for policy analysis. In an open economy, it is
critical to distinguish policies aimed at stimulating saving from those

targeted at promoting investment. The distinction gains importance to the
extent that there is international mobility of financial capital; in its
presence, as Summers (1986) and others have pointed out, the two types of
policies are likely to have opposite effects on the current account of the
balance of payments and on the growth of domestic export and import-

competing industries, particularly in the short runJ
It is one thing to identify potential differences in the effects of
the two types of policies; it is another to determine their magnitude.

Here numerical simulation can play an important role. That role is
particularly significant in the context of a growing, open economy, where

often the sign (let alone the magnitude) of a policy's impact on an

endogenous variable may defy analytical solution. An example of such
indeterminacy appears in Summers's paper, where the long-run implications

2

for the current account of savings and investment policies are ambiguous.
In other analytical studies, even the short-run effects are indeterminate.2
Previous attempts to simulate the effects of growth-oriented tax
policies within a dynamic, open economy framework include the computable
general equilibrium (CCE) simulations of Coulder, Shoven, and Whalley
(1983), who found that the welfare effects of promoting savings through a
consumption tax can be reversed when closed-economy assumptions are

relaxed. Mutti and Grubert (1985) extended this analysis by introducing
foreign production explicitly and by treating foreign tax systems more

realistically. They confirmed that even a limited degree of international
capital mobility can significantly alter results from closed-economy

models. Bovenberg (1986) presented a two-country, two-good model that

integrates the short- and long-run responses to tax policy changes. An
attraction of Bovenberg's work is its more compelling treatment of time:
Mutti and Crubert only consider steady-state results; in Goulder, Shoven,
and Whalley, the behavior of firms is not grounded in intertemporal
optimization.

The present study combines many of the attractive features of these

models. Like Bovenberg's, our model is intertemporal and characterizes not
only the long-run (steady-state) effects of policy initiatives but also

short-run responses and the transition to the new steady state. Decisions
of consumers and producers in the U.S. and abroad derive from intertemporal

optimization. In contrast to 8ovenbergs model but like the others above,
our model is applied to actual U.S. data and contains a great deal of

detail on production and taxes. We distinguish ten domestic industries,

each with a different technology. Industries differ in the extent of their

3

dependence on the export market and in the degree to which they compete

with foreign producers. The model departs from previous work by treating
financial behavior in considerable detail.
There is a natural complementarity between our disaggregated model of
the U.S. economy and ag,regated multi-country models like that of McKibbin

and Sachs (1986). While their model considers six countries (regions), it
does not disaggregate industries within countries. Our model distinguishes
only two countries (the U.S. and the rest of the world) but offers much

additional industry and tax detail. Both models are based on full
intertemporal optimization.

Our model preserves many features of the model of Goulder and Summers
(1987), from which the present work developed, but pays far more attention
to open-economy aspects. In contrast to Goulder and Sunimers, we derive the

behavior of the foreign sector from optimizing behavior. We also introduce
an international market for financial capital: domestic and foreign
households each hold portfolios consisting of assets from both countries,

as in Kouri (1978). Portfolio decisions give rise to capital account
transactions which are integrated with transactions on current account.
In this paper we employ the model to assess the short- and long-run
effects of savings- and investment-promoting changes in U.S. tax policy.

We contrast a savings subsidy (effected through reduced income taxes and
higher taxes on consumption) with investment tax credits (restored to their

effective rates prior to inplementation of Tax Reform Act of 1986). Our
focus is on the implications of these policies for "international
Competitiveness," measured here by the profitability and output of U.S.

export industries. We compare results under the assumption of no

4

international capital mobility (and no international asset transactions)
with those under the assumption of full international mobility (which
assumes that there are no barriers to or costs of such transactions) .

In

the case of capital mobility, we consider the importance of the degree of

international asset substitutability. At one extreme is zero
substitutability, where households hold domestic and foreign assets in

fixed proportions. At the other is perfect substitutability, where
households are indifferent between the two assets and drive their returns

to equality. In general we concentrate on intermediate cases.
Our simulation results show that the implications of these policies
for international competitiveness differ radically once international

capital mobility is introduced. In the absence of such mobility,
investment- and savings-promoting policies each have only minor effects on

U.S. export industries in the short run. In the long run, the effects of
both policies are favorable, since both raise the capital intensity of U.S.
production, increasing productivity and incomes, reducing U.S. goods
prices, and raising the overall volume of trade, all to the benefit of the

export sector. Once international capital mobility is introduced, however,
the effects of the two policies differ from one another in both the short

and the long run. Restoring investment tax credits hurts U.S. export
industries initially but helps them over the longer term. The reverse is

true for the policy of exempting saving from the income tax. These
differences reflect the very different implications of the two types of
policies for the capital account of the balance of payments.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II offers an
overview of our dynamic, open-economy CGE model. Section III lays Out the

S

structure of the model in greater detail. Sections IV and V describe how

we solve and calibrate the model. In Section VI we present our simulation
results, and the final section offers conclusions.

II. Overview of the M1e1
Large CCE models are complex and all too often inaccessible. To
render our model as transparent as possible, we describe here a simple
heuristic model with features similar to those of the larger model used for
simulations. We then describe how the larger model differs from the simple
one.

A.

An Illustrative Model
1. Behavioral Syecjfjcatiorts

Consider a two-country model3 in which each country's output is
produced according to linearly homogeneous production functions with labor
and capital inputs:

(Il-I)

X —

(11-2)

X* —

f(K,L)

f*(K*,L*)

L and K are inputs of labor and capital in home country production, L* and
K* the corresponding inputs into production in the foreign country.

(Asterisks are used throughout to denote foreign-country variables.) X and

X* are outputs of each country. Labor supply is exogenous at each point in
time. Neither labor nor physical (as distinct from financial) capital is
mobile internationally.

6

Total domestic and foreign human wealth, TW}1 and TWH*, can be
expressed as:

(11-3)

TWH —

(11-4)

TWH* —

PV(wL,i)

PV(w*L*,i*)

where w (w*) is the wage, i (i*) is the market interest rate, and PV(. ,

is

the present value operator, defined on flows and interest rates over all

time. If investment is financed solely by retained earnings and firms must
offer a rate of return to equity owners equal to the market interest rate,
then total nonh'unan wealth generated in each country is equal to the

present value of the flow of dividends; that is:

wL

(11-5)

TWK — PV(pX

(11-6)

TWK* — PV(p*X*

-

-

-

pI,i)

w*L*

-

p*I*,i*)

where p (p*) is the price of domestic (foreign) output and I is the

quantity of new capital goods purchased.4 TWK and TWK* are denominated in
the respective currencies of the two countries. In this simple model, the
produced good can be used for consumption or investment, and investment in
each country is a function of the interest rate.

Income, consumption, and saving of each household are expressed in

local currency. At each moment of time, total income Y (Y*) received by
the domestic (foreign) household consists of labor and capital income:

iL

(11-7)

Y —

(11-8)

Y* — w*L* + .1*DIV* + (l--y)DIV.e

+ -yDIV + (l1*)DIV*/e

7

where A is the share of TWK owned by domestic households, A* is the share
of TWK* owned by foreign households, and DIV — pX

-

wL

-

p1 (similarly for

DIV*). e is the nominal exchange rate, defined as units of foreign
currency per dollar. The value of consumption of each household depends on
the household's total ealth and the average return on its investments:

(11-9)

C — C(TWH — 7TWK +

(11-10)

C* — C*(TWH* + -y*TWK* + (l—7)TWK.e, r*)

(l_*)TWK*/e,

r)

r (r*) is the average return on the domestic (foreign) household's
portfolio, a weighted average of the returns on domestic and foreign
assets.

Let a (*) denote the share of the domestic (foreign) household's
wealth that it wishes to hold in assets located domestically (abroad).
Assets from the two countries are imperfect substitutes in portfolios, with
the desired portfolio shares a function of the relative rates of return
(inclusive of exchange rate changes, where the dot over a variable
represents its time derivative):

a(i,

(11-lI)

a —

(11-12)

a* —

*(i

i* -

+

/e)

/e,

j*)

When policy shocks alter relative rates of return on domestic and
foreign assets, desired portfolio shares change. At each moment in time,
the capital account reflects changes in the composition of households'
portfolios as well as overall increases in the value of portfolios

associated with their saving. Let Si (—

— C)

represent the total

8

saving by households resident in country i, and let

denote the net

incremental demand by household i for financial assets of country j
Households divide Si into purchases of assets from the two countries so as
to attain the desired portfolio shares.

Let C. represent the expenditure by household i devoted to

consumption of goods from country j. Assuming that domestic and foreign
goods are imperfect substitutes in consumption, with the demands for each
type of good a function of relative prices:

(11-13>

C. — Cii (Ci,pe/p*).

2. Equilibrium Conditions
At each moment of time, equilibrium requires that the following
conditions hold:

(11-14)

Here D and F subscripts denote "domestic" and "foreign." Equations (11-14)
and (11-15) express the requirement that labor supply and demand balance in

each country. Equations (11-16) and (11-17) show the conditions for
equality of output demand and supply. The final two equations indicate the

9

conditions for savings-investment equality in each country. Note that the

The Larzer Model
1.

Behavioral Specifications

The larger model extends the simpler one in several ways. One major
difference is in the degree of industry disaggregation. Our model
distinguishes ten U.S. industries: agriculture and mining, crude petroleum
and refining, construction, the textile and apparel complex, metals,
machinery, motor vehicles, miscellaneous manufacturing, services, and

housing.5 This disaggregation enables us to address a number of topical
issues relating to U.S. international competitiveness: the effects of
restrictions on agricultural exports, of import penetration in textiles,

steel and automobiles, and of increased trade in services. The model also
incorporates intermediate goods production and substitution by producers
between domestic and foreign intermediate goods.

The larger model treats investment dynamics explicitly. In each
industry, managers choose levels of investment to maximize the value of the

firm. Because of adjustment costs associated with the installation or
removal of new physical capital, in response to a change in economic
conditions firms find it optimal to approach new long-run capital
intensities gradually over time.6

10

The larger model treats corporate financial decisions in some detail.
As in Coulder and Summers, we model firms as financing investments through

both debt and equity issues]
Finally, the larger model incorporates taxes and spending by the U.S.

government. It distinguishes taxes that apply to existing capital (for
example, the corporate income tax) from taxes that apply only to new
capital (for example, investment tax credits) and accounts for the
different effects of these two types of taxes on investment incentives and

asset values. The spending and transfer roles of the government are
modeled explicitly.

2. Equilibrium Conditions
In each country, four types of equilibrium conditions must be

satisfied in each period. First, commodity market equilibrium requires
that the supply of each good equal the sum of home and foreign demands.
Second, labor market equilibrium requires that the aggregate supply and

aggregate demand for labor balance. Third, savings-investment equilibrium
requires that the aggregate demand for external funds by home firms equal

the sum of national saving and net capital inflows. All three conditions
were present in the simpler model above. Introduction of a government
sector adds a fourth requirement (for each country): that total tax
revenues must equal total government spending.

These equilibrium requirements are met through the adjustment of
domestic and foreign wages, domestic and foreign commodity prices, domestic
and foreign interest rates, the nominal exchange rate and lump-sum

adjustments to personal income taxes.8 But since current-period decisions
depend on forward-looking expectations, the current-period prices that

11

satisfy the market-clearing conditions in a given period depend on
expectations of future prices (when agents have foresight, as assumed here,

current equilibrium prices depend on future equilibrium prices). Given
this intertemporal interdependence, we solve the model by transforming the

general equilibrium proLem into one in which current and future prices are
effectively solved separately (as described in Section IV). This enables
us to solve for the set of prices for each period that yields the
intertemporal general equilibrium under perfect foresight expectations.

3. Dynamics
The path of the domestic and foreign economies over time depends on
the adjustments of capital stocks and asset portfolios to policy

initiatives and other exogenous shocks. The model has steady-state
properties: in the long run, asset prices and rates of return adjust so
that the rates of net accumulation of physical capital by industry and the
rates of accumulation of financial capital by households equal g, the

growth rate of effective labor services. This yields a steady state in
which relative prices do not change and all quantities increase at the
rate g.

In the short run, policy shocks generate divergences in the marginal
product of capital across industries as well as in average portfolio

returns to domestic and foreign residents. In the long run, firms'
investment decisions ultimately equalize marginal products of capital
across industries (adjusted for taxes and risk) ,

while

household portfolio

decisions and savings behavior ultimately equalize overall portfolio

returns. The adjustment dynamics associated with firms' investment
decisions have been described by Goulder and Summers. The adjustment

12

dynamics associated with household portfolio decisions, on the other hand,
are more complex in this model because of the introduction of international

asset transactions. Assuming that assets issued by firms in different
countries are imperfect substitutes in portfolios and that households
display home country preference, then a positive shock to domestic firms
that increases the rate of return on dollar-denominated assets will raise
the average rate of return on the portfolios of domestic residents relative

to the average portfolio return to foreign residents. If the difference in
portfolio returns were to be sustained and propensities to save were
similar across countries, domestic residents would accumulate an
ever-increasing share of global wealth -

-a

existence of a steady state. What p

nts this process from persisting is

result inconsistent with the

that the higher accumulation rate of U.S. residents, under the assumption
of home country preference, implies an increase in the share of global

saving invested in the U.S. economy. Over time, this lowers the domestic
rate of return until average returns on domestic and foreign portfolios are

brought to equality. The long-run equalization of returns on portfolios
brought about by households' savings behavior parallels the long-run
equalization of marginal products of capital brought about by firms'
investment decisions.

III. A Detailed Description of the Model.

A.

Production
1.

a.

U.S. Industries

Production Techno1oies. Each of the ten domestic industries produces

a single output using inputs of labor, capital, and intermediate goods. A

13

multi-level structure governs the production of each industry output (see

Table 111.1). Firms choose the quantity of labor that maximizes current
profits, given the current capital stock. Labor and capital combine to
produce a value-added composite, VA. This composite is then combined with
intermediate inputs (x1, x2

XN) in fixed proportions to generate

output, x.

Intermediate inputs are themselves composites of foreign- and

domestic-supplied intermediate goods. Treating domestic and foreign
intermediates as imperfect substitutes in production endogenizes the

relative prices of domestic and foreign intermediate goods. For a given
intermediate good of type i, producers choose the combination of domestic
and foreign inputs that minimizes costs.9
The producer good outputs of the ten industries have several end

uses. They too serve as inputs for each industry. In addition, they
satisfy the demand for final goods by government and the demand for U.S.

exports by foreigners. Finally, they combine in fixed proportions to
produce a representative capital good used in production and to create the
17 consumer goods demanded by households.
b.

10

Producer Behavior. Managers seek to maximize the value of the

firm. Their choice variables at each point in time are employment,

intermediate inputs and investment. Labor and intermediates are chosen to
maximize current profits (given the capital stock)

,

while

investment is

chosen to approach optimally the long-run (profit-maximizing) capital

intensity. The time required to attain the optimal capital intensity
depends on adjustment costs.

14

A starting point for specifying the firm's behavior is the asset
market equilibrium condition that risk-adjusted expected returns be

equalized across domestic assets. The expected return from holding (risky)
equities must be consistent with those from holding a "safe" asset such as

corporate debt. The return on equity is the sum of capital gains and
dividends net of tax. For every firm at each point in time:

(Ill-I)

(1_,)V — VN + (1—9)

—

i(1—9) +

where V is the value of the firm, VN is new share issues, DIV is the
current dividend,

is the capital gains tax rate, 9 is the marginal income

tax rate, i is the nominal interest rate on domestic corporate debt, and ,

is

the equity risk premium. Imposing a transversality condition ruling out

eternal speculative bubbles and integrating yields an expression equating
the value of the firm with the discounted value of after-tax dividends net
of share issues:

EARN + BN

where EARN represents earnings after taxes and interest payments, BN is the

To determine the value of the firm, it is necessary to specify the
firm's financial behavior and identify the elements BN, VN, and DIV in

equation (111-3). We assume that firms pay dividends equal to a constant
fraction, a, of after-tax profits net of economic depreciation and issue

new debt to maintain a constant debt-capital ratio, b. We also assume that
new equity issues represent the marginal source of finance: that is, they
make up the difference between EARN + BN and DIV + IEXF in (III-3)J2

Investment expenditure is the sum of the "direct" costs of the new

where ITC represents the investment tax credit rate,

internal to the firm: to add capital, currently available resources (labor,
existing capital, and intermediate goods) must be devoted to

installation.13 Output is separable between inputs and adjustment costs:

future. The calculation of perfect foresight expectations is discussed in
Section IV.
2.

Foreizn Industry

The treatment of foreign production is analogous. A representative
foreign producer generates output using capital and labor inputs. The
specification of investment is the same as for domestic firms, as are the

foreign producer's financing rules. Total nonhuman wealth located abroad,
TWK*, is the sum of foreign-located debt and equity. The value of the
latter is the discounted sum of foreign dividends net of foreign share
issues.

B.

Household Behavior

Households are represented as forward-looking and having perfect
foresight. The treatment of domestic and foreign households is similar,
although more detail is provided on the domestic side.

18

1. ConsumntiOfl and Asset Choices

In each country, a representative, infinitely-lived household solves a

multilevel decision problem (Table 111.2). Consider the domestic
household. Its problem is to choose a path of consumption and a path of
portfolio holdings. When domestic and foreign assets are imperfect
substitutes and offer different expected returns, portfolio and consumption
choices need to be coordinated, since the choice of portfolio affects the

overall rate of return to the household. One approach to this problem
would be to explicitly incorporate risk. But the integration of portfolio
choice and consumption demands in the face of risk and uncertainty presents
difficult, unresolved theoretical issues, particularly when there are many

time periods and many consumption goods.14 Resolving these issues is
beyond the scope of this paper. Moreover, risk may only partly explain the
main empirical fact of interest: that households hold diversified

portfolios despite sustained differences in rates of return.'5 In this
investigation we adopt an alternative approach. Our starting point is the
observation that households exhibit strong home-country preference: assets
from their own country often make up the bulk of their portfolios, even

when rates of return on other-country assets are comparable or higher. In
keeping with this observation, we posit a portfolio preference function
which is consistent with the observed home-country preference yet which can
be embedded within a utility-maximizing framework that allows households to
adjust asset shares in accordance with differences in rates of return.'6
(Below we also report results using an alternative specification in which

consumption and asset preferences are decoupled.) In each period t, the
household maximizes a utility function of the form:

19

(111-11) U

where 6 is the rate of time preference, C is the inverse of the
intertemporal elasticity of substitution, C is an index of overall
consumption in a given period, and A is a function of the household's asset

holdings. We specialize A to a CES function of a and 1-a, the shares of
the household's portfolio devoted to domestic and foreign assets:17

where WK is the total nonhuman wealth owned by the household, r and r* are
the annual after-tax returns offered to the household on its holdings of
domestic and foreign assets, YL is labor income net of all taxes and
transfers, and p is the price index for overall consumption.

A(.) summarizes the household's portfolio preferences: if r —
households maximize utility by choosing the asset shares

When

rates of return differ, however, maintaining the portfolio shares a0 shares
and 1-a0 has a cost in terms of a lower overall return than that which
could be obtained if the household held more of the asset with the higher

return. The household chooses the path of a that balances the rewards of
approaching preferred shares against the costs in terms of a lower overall
return on the portfolio.

20

The parameter p in the portfolio preference function is related to a,
the elasticity of substitution between asset shares (p —

1-1/a).

When a —

irrespective of differences in rates of return. As a -.

behavior approaches the limiting case of perfect substitutability, where
the slightest difference in returns leads households to hold only the asset

(111-19) TWK* — V* + DEBT*

where TWK and TWK* denote total nonhuman wealth located at home and abroad,

denominated in the respective currencies of each resident, as in Section

II.A above. Total nonhuman wealth of domestic and foreign residents, WK
and WK*, can be expressed as:

(111-20) WK — T%K + (1-i*)TWK*/e
(111-21) WK* — .i*TWK* —
where

(l-)TWK.e

represents the proportion of the debt and equity of domestic firms

held by domestic residents, 7* expresses the proportion of the debt and

equity of foreign firms held by foreigners, as in Section hA. If
households wish to maintain current asset proportions, then a — -1TWK/WK and
— -y*TWK*/WK*.

When rates of return change, however, households

immediately alter the composition of their portfolios. Thus, changes in
asset holdings from period to period reflect both changes in the
composition of portfolios and increases in portfolio size associated with
household saving.

22

Each asset generally yields a different return to residents of

different countries; this reflects anticipated exchange rate movements and

are defined analogously.

2. The Composition of Current Consumption19
For domestic households, overall consumption, C, in each period is a
Cobb-Douglas aggregate of the 17 consumption goods in the model, implying

that consumption spending is allocated across consumption goods in fixed

expenditure shares. Our model incorporates imported consumer goods by
treating each good c. as a CES composite of domestic and foreign goods of

type i. Suppressing subscripts, we express the CES composite as:

Since c(.) is homothetic, the ratio of domestic and foreign goods in
the composite is independent of its level. Households select the optimal
mix of domestic and foreign goods to minimize the cost per unit of
composite.

C.

Government Sectors
The domestic economy government is the same as in Goulder and Summers,

to which the reader is referred for details. It has three functions:
collecting taxes, distributing transfers, and purchasing goods and
services.

The model incorporates each of the major taxes in the United States,

as in Table 111.3. It includes features of the U.S. tax code which impose
different effective rates on new and old capital; the explicit treatment of
profits taxes, investment tax credits, and capital gains taxes allows us to
capture the effects of tax policy on investment and dividend payment

decisions. It also distinguishes economic from tax depreciation.
The level of government spending (transfers plus purchases) is
exogenous. Transfers and purchases each represent a fixed share of overall
spending. Purchases fall on to specific producer goods in fixed expenditure
shares.

Since the model exhibits steady.state growth in the base case, overall
real government spending must increase at that steady-state growth rate, g.

In the base case, the government budget balances in each period. In
revised-case simulations, real government spending is fixed at the same

24

levels as in the base case; budget balance is maintained through lump-sum
adjustments to personal tncome taxes.

20

The foreign government performs the same functions and has the same
tax instruments as the domestic economy government, although individual
industries are not distinguished.

D.

Imnorts and Exnorts

Import demands consist of the demands for imported intermediate goods
by U.S. producers and for imported consumer goods by U.S. consumers.
Foreign producers require the same price (after conversion to foreign

currency) for goods sold in the U.S. as for goods sold locally. These
prices adjust to clear the market for each foreign good.

Foreign demands for U.S. exports depend on the value of overall
foreign output and on the price of exports relative to foreign goods:

IV. Solving the Model
Equilibrium must satisfy two sets of conditions. Intratemporal
equilibrium requires that, given expectations of future variables, current

supplies and demands balance in each period. Intertemporal equilibrium
requires that expectations conform to the values realized in later periods.

25

At each point in time, expectations are embedded within the current

period values of "forward" variables. For the domestic economy, the
forward variables are:

The Vi's and B.'s can be expressed in terms of the Q's Zr's and current

summarized by the values of Q and Z for each industry and the value of A.
The forward variables for the foreign economy are:

We refer to the variables with "E" superscripts as "lead" variables. We
also employ eE, a lead variable for the exchange rate.

Solution proceeds in two steps. First, we posit values for the lead
variables for t — 2, 3

T+1, where T is the last period simulated.

The first-level, intratemporal equilibrium problem is to calculate a
general equilibrium solution in every period conditional on these guesses.
The second-level, intertemporal equi1ibriun problem is to solve for the
correct values for the lead variables.

A.

Intratemporal EQuilibrium
Intratemporal equilibrium requires that in each country and at each

period of time: (I) the demand for labor equal its supply. (2) the demand
for output from each industry equal its supply, (3) total external
borrowing by firms equal total saving by residents of the given country
plus the net capital inflow to that country, and (4) government revenues
equal government spending. These requirements imply .a total of 17
equilibrium conditions (see Table IV.l): two for the domestic and foreign
labor markets, ten for the domestic product market, one for the foreign
product market, two for the domestic and foreign loanable funds markets,

and two for the domestic and foreign governments' budget balance. It
suffices to solve for 16 equilibrium conditions, as the remaining one will

then be satisfied by Walras's Law. To obtain the intratemporal

27

equilibrium, we employ the Powell (1970) algorithm, which tries alternative

values for 16 "prices:" the ten domestic output prices, the foreign output
price, the domestic and foreign gross interest rates, the nominal exchange
rate, and the domestic and foreign tax scalars (that control the lump-sum
tax adjustments necessary to bring about budget balance in each country).
The nominal wage in each country (in the own currency) is exogenous and
assumed to grow at a rate of six percent. The nominal exchange rate serves
to bring nominal magnitudes at home and abroad into line (see footnote 8).
In Appendix 1 we outline the method of deriving excess demands in each
period from the given set of prices tried by the intratemporal solution
algorithm.

Once the intratemporal equilibrium is obtained for the first period,
we augment the capital stocks of each industry on the basis of net
investment, and increment the total supplies of domestic and foreign labor

by their growth rate, g. We then repeat the equilibrium calculations for
the next period. In this manner we solve for every period in the
simulation interval.

B.

Intertenrporal Equilibrium

Perfect foresight requires that expectations conform to the values

that ultimately obtain. To meet this requirement, we repeatedly solve the
model forward, each time revising the expectations (embedded in the lead

variables) that affect each intratemporal equilibrium. Appendix 2
describes our procedure for obtaining the perfect foresight expectations.

28
V.

Data and Parameters

A.

Stocks and Flows

We combine information from different sources to form a 1983 benchmark

data set. Much of the benchmark data is drawn from the general equilibrium
data Set recently assembled by Scholz (1987). The Scholz data include the
following information:

Production Data
Final demand vectors of consumption, investment, government spending,
imports, and exports by producer good
Matrix of input-output transactions
Vectors of labor inputs by industry
Labor taxes and intermediate input taxes by industry
Production function elasticities by industry

Consunrntion Data

Matrix of expenditures on consumer goods by household
Vector of savings by household
Transition matrix between producer (industry) and consumer goods
Vectors of income taxes paid, sales taxes paid, marginal tax rates,and
transfers received by household

We have supplemented these data with information on capital taxes and
the financial behavior of firms, including capital gains tax rates, tax
depreciation rates, dividend-payout and debt-capital ratios; and equity

risk premia.23 We have also added information on capital stocks by
industry obtained from the Survey of Current Business. Base case values
for tax rates and behavioral parameters are displayed in Table V.1. Tax

29

rates for the foreign sector are set equal to the weighted average of the
rates applying in the U.S.24
Since domestic firms distinguish between domestic and foreign
intermediate goods in production, it is necessary to employ a domestic and
foreign input-output ratrix describing the use of domestic and foreign-made

inputs in each industry. The relationship among the domestic and foreign
input-output matrices, the compcnents of final demand, and value added are
indicated in Figure V.1.

Since the U.S. government does not produce a foreign input-output

matrix, we constructed one. This involved categorizing imports according
to their end use (intermediate use, consumption, or investment).25

In the benchmark data set, we impose an initial value for ,

the

share

of domestic nonhwnan wealth owned by domestic residents, obtained from
information on foreign ownership of U.S. assets and total domestically
located assets from the Survey of Current Business and Federal Reserve

Balance Sheets. We also impose a value for the U.S. share of global wealth
based on a comparison of GDP in the U.S. and other non-communist countries.
With this information we derive (as discussed below) the benchmark level of
foreign wealth and the benchmark portfolio shares.

B.

Parameters

Parameterizing the model involves selecting certain parameters from
outside sources and deriving the remainder from restrictions posed by two
sorts of requirements:

Replication Requirement. In the base case, the model must generate an
equilibrium solution with values matching those of the benchmark data
set.

30

Balanced Growth Requirement. In the base case, the model must
generate a steady-state growth path.

First, we specify the exogenously growth rate of effective labor, g,
and the exogenous growth rate of nominal wages, 1r0.

g determines the

steady-state real growth rate of the economy and r0 the steady-state

inflation rate. These variables take the values .03 and 06, respectively.
In our central case simulation, we employ a value of 0.6 for time
preference (5) and a value of 0.5 for the intertemporal elasticity of
substitution in consumption (l/c).

In the steady state, the rate of gross investment, I/K, in each
industry must satisfy:

(V-i)

I/K — g +

where subscripts have been suppressed for convenience. K, g, and

are

contained in the benchmark data set. We derive the initial level of
investment in each industry from equation (V-i). A similar procedure
determines initial values for the depreciable capital stock, KDEP.

We derive the benchmark values of firm debt (DEBT) and equity (V) from

data on capital stocks, tax rates, and nominal interest rates.26 Summing
across domestic industries yields TWK, total domestically-generated

nonhuman wealth. TWK*, total nonhuman wealth generated abroad, is a given
multiple, ii,

of

rwic27 Using TWK* and the foreign interest rate i*, we

derive foreign capital incomes.

The procedure is similar for human wealth. From data on labor
incomes, taxes, and transfers, we calculate domestic human wealth, TWH, as

31

the present value of the stream of after-tax labor and transfer income.
Foreign human wealth, TWH*, is set at m.TWH.
and the requirement of capital account balance in the base

From

case, we derive -1* and the initial values for the portfolio shares a and
2*.

In

the benchmark equilibrium, before-tax nominal interest rates are

equal at home and abroad. Those nominal interest rates must be consistent
with the requirement that domestic investment equal national saving plus

the net capital inflow. This condition can only be evaluated after wealth
levels and portfolio shares have been determined, yet these levels and

shares themselves depend on the assumed value for the interest rate. Hence
is necessary to iterate to obtain the benchmark value for the nominal
interest rate.

Table V.2 displays the base case (calibrated) values for the principal
variables of the model.

VI. Simulation Results
The "base case" equilibrium path is the standard against which the

effects of policy changes are measured. As mentioned above, the U.S. and
foreign economies display steady-state growth in the base case at an annual

rate of three percent. We perform simulations spanning an interval of 75
years (T —

75), with the equilibria spaced one year apart. Following a

policy change, both economies approach quite closely the new steady state

well before the 75th year, and using larger values for T does not
significantly affect the simulation results.

32

A.

Promoting Savings through a Consurntion Tax
Our savings-promoting policy combines a four percentage point increase

in taxes on consumption (sales and excise taxes, most of which are in the
five to ten percent range initially) with a compensating reduction in

domestic households' marginal income tax rates from 0.285 to 0.256. The
policy change is treated as unanticipated and takes effect in the first

period. It is approximately revenue neutral over the long term: the
present value of the stream of changes in government revenue is

approximately zero.28 It encourages saving by raising the after-tax rate
of return.
1.

No Mobility

We first examine the effects of this policy change in the absence of

internationally mobile financial capital. In this scenario, the portfolios
of domestic and foreign households contain only the assets of the country
of residence, and thus households have no concern for rates of return

offered on assets located in the other country. The impact effect of the
policy change is to raise the after-tax return for domestic households and
generate additional saving, allowing a drop in the equilibrium domestic

gross interest rate. The lower interest rate implies an increase in fixed
investment of 1.0 percent relative to the base case in the first period, as

indicated in Table VI.l. Over time, the rise in the capital intensity of
the economy implies a lower marginal product of capital and a lower value
of Q for any given interest rate; thus, the rate of investment falls,
although the level of investment remains higher than in the base case

because of the higher capital stock. In the new steady state, the rate of
investment in each industry returns to its long-run value, while aggregate

33

investment exceeds that of the base case (for corresponding years) by 1.4
percent.

In this scenario, the effects on imports and exports are minor in

both the short and long run. Since capital is internationally immobile,
there is no capital acccunt -

-a

potentially important channel for

transmitting effects on merchandise trade through its impact on the

exchange rate. In the short run, real exports are not significantly
affected by the policy change. Over the longer term, the higher capital
intensity and productiveness of the U.S. economy imply higher real output
and incomes; this yields somewhat higher demands for foreign intermediate

and final goods and a slightly increased volume of international trade. In
the new steady state, real exports are approximatelyO.4 percent higher
than in the base case.
2.

Mobility

The same initiative produces quite different impacts once capital

mobility is introduced. The differences are most easily seen by comparing
across columns of Table VII, which vary the substitutability of domestic
and foreign assets.

We focus on the results of our central mobility case, which employs a

value of 1.0 for a. As before, the impact effect of the policy change is
to raise the after-tax return to domestic households. We model the U.S.
and foreign individual income tax systems as residence-based: households
pay capital income to their own governments, regardless of where

the

capital income originated.29 This implies that for domestic households the
new policy raises after-tax returns on savings invested at home and abroad.
Thus, the policy change has no first-order effect on the international

34

allocation of their (increased) saving. For foreign households, the change
in policy does not affect the wedge between before- and after-tax returns,

since their marginal tax rates do not change. The asymmetry in the changes
in marginal rates implies significant adjustments in the capital account.

In the central mobility case, domestic households increase their

saving by 5.1 percent in the initial period. Since the largest share of
domestic portfolios consists of domestic assets and since the new policy

has relatively little effect on the desired portfolio compo' ion, the bulk
of the increase in domestic household saving is directed toward domestic

assets. This depresses the U.S. before-tax nominal interest rate, which
falls initially from 7.1 to 6.8 percent.

ecause foreigners' marginal tax rates remain unchanged, the fall in
before-tax interest rates in the U.S. leads to similar reductions in the

after-tax returns they receive from U.S. assets. This implies a lower
average return on foreigners' portfolios and lower overall foreign saving,

which falls by approximately one percent on impact. Much of the reduction
takes the form of reduced accumulation of U.S. assets; in the first year,
inflows of foreign capital to the U.S. fall by 3.4 percent from $15.0
billion (1983 dollars) in the base case to $14.5 billion in the policy

change simulation. But the increase in saving by domestic households more
than offsets the decrease in capital inflows from abroad, and total
domestic saving (national saving plus the net capital inflow) increases, as
shown in Figure VI.l.

Increased purchases of foreign assets by domestic residents combine
with reduced purchases of domestic assets by foreign residents to produce a
capital account deficit, since the capital account balance is zero in the

35

base case. In the first year, the capital account balance is $-3.5
billion. The capital account deficit puts downward pressure on the dollar,
which depreciates by one percent initially. The cheaper dollar benefits
export industries, whose output increases by .75 percent initially, and
leads to a trade surplus.

Thus the short-run impacts on foreign trade of this savings-promoting
initiative are different in the presence of international capital mobility.
The differences stem from changes in the capital account and from
subsequent effects on exchange rates.

Figure VI.l illustrates that the long-term consequences of the savings

subsidy differ substantially from the short-term effects. In the short and
medium term, domestic households enjoy a higher average return on their
portfolios than do foreign households, reflecting the reduced marginal tax

rates on their incomes. Incomes and saving by U.S. households grow faster
than do those of foreigners. Much of the increase in saving by U.S.
households is directed abroad. As a result, net income from abroad rises
over time, putting upward pressure on the dollar and reducing export

demands. Real exports decline (relative to the base case) over time. In
the new steady state, real exports are 0.1 percent below the base case
levels.

These results underscore the importance of accounting for international capital mobility in assessing the effects of savings-promoting
policy on the performance of export (and import-competing) industries.
Just as important, they indicate that such a policy's long-run consequences
may be dramatically different from its effects in the short term.

36

To test the robustness of these results, we perform the same policy

simulation for alternative values of a. The essential pattern of effects
is little different: whether a equals 02, 1 or 5, the savings-promoting
policy initially leads to increased accumulation of foreign assets by
domestic households and reduced accumulation of domestic assets by foreign

households. This implies a deficit on the capital account, a decline in
the value of the dollar, and a rise in real exports in the short run.3° In
all three simulations, the position of exports is reversed in the long run
as higher net income flows raise the value of the

dollar. The magnitude of

these effects increases as the value of a grows. When a is large, U.S.
households' portfolio responses are greater: since they enjoy higher
returns on assets located abroad than on those located at home, they
respond to the policy change by devoting a larger share of their saving to
purchases of new foreign assets.31 As a result, the capital account
deficit is larger the higher the value of a, and exchange rate depreciation

is more pronounced. Hence export industries receive a larger initial
boost.

B.

Resurrecting Investment Tax Credits
We next investigate the effects of restoring investment tax credits

(ITC's) to their effective rates prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
Since the credits apply only to equipment and not structures, effective
subsidy rates differ by industry according to the composition of each

industry's physical capital in terms of structures and equipment. The ITC
renewal is assumed to be unanticipated and to take effect in the first

period. Where the previous policy affected incentives to save, this one
affects incentives to invest.

37

1. No Mobility
The impact effect of implementing the ITC is to lower the effective
cost of new capital to domestic industry and stimulate investment demand,
as show-n in Table VI.2. Tax-adjusted q and investment rise except in the
housing services industry, which enjoys little benefit from the policy
change since its capital consists almost entirely of structures and its

effective ITC rate is still zero. Heightened investment demands exert
upward pressure on the domestic interest rate, which elicits an increase in
saving by U.S. households of approximately 2.7 percent in the first year
(see Table VI.2).

The short-run impact on exports is very small. Eventually, however,
real exports increase significantly relative to the base case, reflecting
the fact that restoring ITC's raises the capital intensity of the economy
over time, leading to higher incomes and output and a higher volume of

trade. In the new steady state, real exports are approximately two percent
higher than in the base case.
2.

Mobility

Restoring the ITC produces quite different results in the presence of

capital mobility, particularly in the short run. Again we focus on the

central mobility case (

— l).32

As in the no-mobility scenario, the

initial impact of the new policy is to stimulate investment demands and

raise the domestic interest rate. Higher U.S. interest rates induce
additional saving not only by U.S. residents but also by foreigners.
Higher U.S. rates increase the relative attractiveness of U.S. -located

assets, leading to increased demands for these assets by U.S. and foreign

residents. Total U.S. domestic saving (saving by U.S. nationals plus the

38

net capital inflow) rises, reflecting the increase in global saving and the
increase in the share of that saving devoted to the accumulation of U.S.

assets. These changes in asset accumulation patterns imply a surplus on
the U.S. capital account, which puts upward pressure on the dollar, making

U.S. exports more expensive and reducing demand for U.S. exports by
approximately 0.2 percent on impact.
Thus, restoring ITC's has different (though not exceptionally large)
short-run implications for export industries once an allowance is made for
international capital mobility.

In the presence of mobile capital, long-run effects differ

significantly from short-run impacts. The long-run effects reflect the
fact that this policy change is source-based, stimulating capital formation

in the LL.

rather

than globally (as in the savings-promotion policy). As

a result, U.S. residents, who own

most

U.S. -located capital, experience

faster income growth than do foreign residents. Their higher incomes bring
about a rise in their accumulation of foreign assets relative to
foreigners' accumulation of domestic assets, causing the capital account

balance to fall aid ultimately become negative. The rise in net interest
income from abroad also reflects the increased accumulation of foreign

assets by domestic residents. These considerable income flows help push up
demands for dollars and cause the exchange rate to rise over time. Finally,
the higher domestic incomes imply fast growth in the demands for imports by
domestic consumers and domestic industry, and the trade balance worsens
over time.

The negative long-run trade balance is due to higher import volumes,
not lower exports: in the long run, real exports exceed base case levels.

39

This is a consequence both of a higher volume of trade and lower real

prices for U.S. goods. The ITC raises the capital intensity of the
domestic economy, making labor more productive and lowering prices of U.S.

goods to foreigners. The real exchange rate falls by 0.6 percent after ten
years, despite the increase in the nominal exchange rate.33 Thus, both
income and relative price changes contribute to the revival of export

demands. Figure VI.2 suggests that very little time is required for the
initial adverse effects of the ITC's on exports to be reversed. In the
long run, the real value of U.S. exports rises by 1.6 percent over base
case levels.

These results underscore the importance of distinguishing the short-

and long-run effects of growth-oriented tax policy. While confirming that
there may be a conflict between investment proriotion and the viability of

export industries, our results suggest that the conflict may materialize
only briefly.

C.

Differences Across Industries

So far our discussion of simulation results has focused on aggregate

effects. The savings- and investment-promoting policies also yield very
different effects across industries, differences our model is ideally
suited to bring out.

Table VI.3 displays some of these differences. The first two panels
of the table show the effects of the savings subsidy in the no-mobility

case and the mobility case with c — 1.

In general, the savings subsidy

boosts capital goods industries (construction, metlas, machinery) relative

to consumer goods industries in the short run. Over the longer term, the
relative advantage of capital goods industries declines as the capital

40

intensity of the U.S. economy rises and after-tax rates of return and rates

of accumulation fall. Under the savings subsidy, the differences between
the no-mobility and mobility cases are relatively minor for industries
that have little dependence on the export market. In contrast, for exportoriented industries the mobility assumptions are important, as they affect

the patter of exports over time. Thus, in the short run the exportoriented agriculture and textiles industries fare better in the presence of
mobility than in its absence; the reverse is the case in the long run.

The last two panels of Table VI.3 consider the effects of the ITC

renewal. Here the differences across industries mainly reflect differences
in the magnitude of investment credits across industries. The petroleum
refining and housing industries receive the smallest credits because the

ratio of equipment to structures is low in these industries. In the first
period, investment in housing declines slightly and investment in petroleum
refining increases by less then three percent, while investment in most

other industries rises by between five and seven percent. In the long run,
investment in every industry exceeds base case levels, a consequence of the
overall increase in productivity and incomes generated by the policy
change.

D. Sensitivity Analysis
We test further the robustness of our results by considering the
savings- and investment-promoting policies under alternative values for the
parameter 0, whose inverse is the intertenporal elasticity of substitution

in consumption. The simulations previously considered adopt a value of 0.5
for this elasticity (0 —

2).

Table VI.4 displays results for these central

41
case simulations as well, as for simulations with values of 0.25 and 1.0 for
this elasticity.

With a higher intertemporal consumption elasticity, the
savings-promoting policy induces a larger increase in savings by U.S.
households, a sharper drop in gross-of-tax U.S. interest rates, and a

larger reduction in savings bdd foreign households. There is a larger
increase in domestic households' accumulation of foreign assets and a
larger decrease in foreign households' accumulation of domestic assets
implying larger capital account deficits initially and larger impacts on
exchange rates and real exports. Under all three values for the
intertemporal elasticity, the pattern of effects over time is very similar:

real exports rise in the short run, but fall in the long run.
Restoring the ITC similarly has larger effects on domestic households'
saving the larger the value of the intertemporal substitution elasticity.
The pattern of effects on exports is similar across different values for

this elasticity: in all simulations, the policy shock hurts exports
initially but eventually leads to export volumes above base case levels.

We also consider both policies under an alternative model
specification in which households' consumption and portfolio choices are

independent. This alternative specification may appeal to those who prefer
to leave asset preferences out of individuals' utility functions.
Households first choose portfolio shares according to

(Vl.1)

dln[o/(1—a)] — a

dln(rDD/rDF)

where a is the elasticity of substitution between portfolio shares. They
then choose consumption levels to iuaxiiuize the utility function.

where s is the current time period. However, this independence of
consumption and portfolio choices is achieved at some cost: households'

portfolio decisions do not stem from utility maximization but rather are

based on the arbitrary rule of equation (VI.l). Table VI.4 reveals that
the pattern of results is very similar under the alternative specification
to that under the old one: the savings-promoting policy again creates
capital account deficits and stimulates exports in the short run, while
leading to capital account improvements and declines in real exports over

the longer term. Similarly, restoring investment tax credits implies
capital account surpluses and reduced export volumes in the short term, and
capital account deficits and higher export volumes in the long run.

VII. Conclusions and Directions for Further Research
In this paper we have presented a new framework for analyzing the

effects of domestic and foreign policies on the U.S. economy. The model is
unique in combining a disaggregated treatment of industry interactions, a
detailed specification of personal and corporate taxes, a rigorous

attention to adjustment dynamics, and an integrated treatment of current

and capital account transactions. We apply the model to analyze the shortand long-run effects of savings- and investment-promoting tax policies on
the viability of export industries, and find that in the presence of
internationally mobile financial capital the effects of the two types of
policies differ significantly from one another and change fundamentally
over time.

43

In the absence of international capital mobility, investment- and
savings-promoting policies each have insignificant short-run effects and

favorable long-run effects on U.S. export industries. The long-run
benefits reflect the fact that both policies raise the overall capital
intensity of U.S. production, leading to an increase in productivity and
incomes, to lower relative prices for U.S. goods, and to a higher overall

volume of trade. In the presence of international capital mobility, the
two types of policies differ from one another in their short- and long-term

consequences. Restoring investment tax credits tends to hurt U.S. export
industries in the short run, but help them subsequently. The reverse is
true of policies that subsidize saving. These differences reflect the very
different implications of the two types of policies for the capital account
of the balance of payments in the short and long runs.

In future work we intend to consider closely the normative
implications of these policy alternatives; this study has concentrated on

positive issues. We also plan to apply the model to analyze the effects of
recent changes in U.S. fiscal policy, of trade policy alternatives, and of
a variety of industrial policies.

Appendix 1: DerivatiOn of Excess Demands based on Current Prices

Given a set of current prices, firms' optimal demands for labor and

intermediate inputs can be determined. Given the interest rate and lead
values for V and Z, one can derive the current values for Q and Z.

From

these one can derive investment, adjustment costs, demands for external
funds, and the level of output of each industry.

On the consumer side, the current marginal utility of wealth, At(A*t)
E

can be calculated from the lead value, A t+l

t+l' and from the current

interest rate, based on equation (111-17). Portfolio shares and overall
consumption levels for each household can then be determined from current
prices and the current value for A, using the first-order conditions
(111-15) and (111-16).

Current prices then dictate the allocation of current consumption

expenditure into demands for specific consumption goods. Based on
households' shares of dollar and foreign-currency-denominated wealth and
firms' dividend and interest payments, we derive households' capital

incomes, Subtracting the value of consumption from households' total
after-tax incomes yields household savings. Households devote their
savings to the accumulation of domestic and foreign assets so as to attain
the desired asset shares.

Demands by government depend only on current prices; lead variables
are not employed here.

Procedure for Obtaining Perfect Foresizht Exoectations

To solve for perfect foresight expectations, we first obtain the
values for V, Z, A, V*, A*, and e which ultimately prevail in the new

steady state after a policy change. In the base case, the steady-state
values for these variables emerge from the calibration procedure discussed
in the next section; in revised case simulations, a more complex simulation
procedure is required.

34

We then assign the steady-state values as

terminal values for the lead variables:

(A2-l) V1 —

where T is the last simulation period, and the subscript SS denotes the

value for a variable in the new steady state. Next, we conjecture an
initial path for the lead variables.

We then solve the model for each within-period equilibrium given the

initial path of the lead variables.35 The within-period equilibrium
solution provides a sequence of derived values: V1. V2
e2

VT;...; e1,

eT. We compare our conjectures with contemporaneous derived

46

values, updating the guesses in a Causs-Seidel fashion. For example, we
adjust the

(A2-2)

path according to:

—

pV' + (l—p)V

where k represents the iteration and p is a parameter between 0 and 1.

This procedure generally brings lead and realized values within .01 percent
of one another within fifty iterations.
In this manner we generate paths for the forward variables that have

the appropriate slope across any two consecutive periods, since agents have
perfect foresight and impose the appropriate relationship across periods in
determining a current value on the basis of the corresponding lead
variable. Each equilibrium path also has the appropriate level, as
determined by the terminal values for each variable.

Footnotes

1. Slemrod (1988) offers an excellent summary of the implications of
international capital mobility for the theory of capital income taxation.

2. See, for example, Bovenberg (1987). The direction of the effects
depends on the relative magnitudes of intratemporal elasticities of
substitution in investment and intertemporal elasticities of substitution

in consumption. Giovannini (1987) shows that the relative size of these
elasticities also determines the welfare consequences of savings- and
investment-oriented policies under "small country" assumptions.

3. The framework here is essentially a two-country portfolio balance
model, as analyzed for example by Henderson and Rogoff (1982).

4. The basis for equations (11-5) and (11-6) is the arbitrage condition
requiring that the return to owners of firms equal the rate offered on

alternative assets. This is discussed in Section III.
5.

Thus, the model offers considerably more industry detail than the

Goulder-Sumniers model, which distinguishes five domestic industries.

6. This is the asset price approach to investment as developed in Summers
(1981).

7. There is some debate as to what constitutes the best sp.ecification of

firms' financing decisions. We adopt the "traditional" approach, according
to which the marginal source of funds for investment is new share issues.
For a discussion of this and other approaches, see Poterba and Summers
(1985).

8. The nominal exchange rate brings nominal magnitudes at home and abroad
into line. If all prices (other than the numeraire) are endogenous, the
nominal exchange rate is superfluous. This is not the case if some prices

48

(other than the numeraire) are fixed in nominal terms, however. In the
model, domestic and foreign nominal wages are specified exogenously (and
increase over time at a specified rate that determines the long-run
inflation rate), permitting a role for the exchange rate.

9. Thus the demands for foreign inputs derive from optimizing behavior,
with the demand elasticities directly related to the substitution
elasticities embedded in the production functions.

10. This transformation of producer goods into consumer goods is necessary
because the categories for outputs from production data differ from the
categories for goods from consumer expenditure data.

11. See Poterba and Summers (1985) for an explicit derivation of this
expression for V.

12. This specification conforms to the "traditional" view of dividend
behavior. Some empirical support for this view is presented in Poterba and
Summers (1985). Further evidence comes from the large volume of share
repurchases in recent years documented in Shoven (1986).

13. An alternative is external adjustment Costs, according to which the
costs of adjustment are borne through payments to an agent (for example, an
enterprise providing installation services) external to the firm. See Mussa
(1978) for a discussion of these different approaches.

14. The consumption-based capital asset pricing model (see, for example,
Duffie and Zarne, 1987) offers a potential approach to this problem,

although the difficulties of empirical implementation are formidable.

15. Mehra and Prescott (1982) and Adler and Dumas (1983), for example,
argue that exchange rate risk provides only part of the explanation as to
why households maintain internationally diversified portfolios.

16. The model is agnostic as regards the specific bases for households'
portfolio preferences. One explanation might invoke risk considerations.
Another might refer to different liquidity services offered by domestic and

foreign assets. Poterba and Rotemberg (1983) refer to such services to
justify including money in individual utility function.

17. An alternative formulation would define A in terms of asset levels
rather than shares. But since asset stocks are used to finance future
consumption, adding levels of asset holdings to the utility function would
introduce an element of double-counting.

18. The value of a thus critically influences the extent to which policy
shocks or other exogenous changes will generate international capital flows.

19. We do not consider the foreign household here, since different
consumer goods are not distinguished in the foreign country.

20. This facilitates welfare evaluations, since the household utility
functions do not incorporate welfare derived from government-provided goods
and services.

21. See Goulder and Summers (1987).
22. See equation (111-17) and the appendix to Goulder and Summers (1987).
23. Our 10-sector disaggregation is not fully compatible with the
disaggregation in the Scholz data. The Scholz data includes metals,
machinery, and miscellaneous manufacturing as one sector, while in our

model these are three different sectors. We have split out the Scholz data
based on the shares of value added represented by each of the three
components.

We have also added information pertaining to the housing industry.

The Scholz data subsumes housing within the real estate sector. To use

50

this data in our model, the real estate sector data had to be divided into

housing and other real estate. The weights used to disaggregate the real
estate sector data were calculated based on shares of value added in the
367 x 367 1977 input-output matrix published by the Department of Commerce
(1984).
24.

Ultimately we intend to employ tax rates that more closely reflect

effective rates abroad.

25. This information was obtained from the End-Use Import Tables of the
Bureau of the Census Highlights of U.S. Export and Import Trade (1983) for

merchandise trade and from MeCulloch (1987) for trade in services. We
applied it as follows:
a.

From the end-use tables we obtained consumption and investment

imports by type of good. For each import, total imports for intermediate
use were then calculated by subtracting consumption and investment imports
from total imports (of a given type) as given by Scholz.
b.

Domestic intermediates were calculated by subtracting foreign

intermediates from total intermediate goods.
c.

The foreign (domestic) input-output matrix was then calculated

by multiplying each row of the total input-output matrix by the ratio of

foreign (domestic) intermediate goods to total intermediate goods. Thus we
assumed, for each type of intermediate good, that the ratio of domestic to

foreign inputs of that type was the same across sectors. This assumption
was necessary given the absence information on the uses of intermediate
imports by sectors.

26. The procedure is described in Goulder and Summers.
27. The value of m is set at the ratio of foreign to U.S. GDP.

51

28. As described above, government budget balance is maintained in each
year through lump-sum adjustments to domestic households' individual income

tax obligations. The present value of these adjustments is approximately zer

29. The U.S. tax system in fact is primarily residence based; the
corporate income tax has source-based elements, however, including the
foreign tax credit.

30. The difference in returns offered to U.S. savers on domestic and
foreign assets is relatively small, considerably smaller than the

differences in gross interest rates across countries. This reflects the
appreciation of the exchange rate, which, ceteris paribus, lowers the
return to U.S. households on foreign assets.

31. The case of perfect substitutability is also of interest but poses
special difficulties. Under residence-based taxation, such a scenario
generally implies a corner solution: for one of the residents, the
after-tax return will not be the same for the two assets, and thus the

resident will only hold one of the two assets. If residents' tax rates
differ, then if one of the residents faces equal after-tax returns on both
assets, the other will not. See Slemrod (1988).

32. We also consider the effects of this policy change under alternative
values for the asset elasticity of substitution, a. As Table VI.2 shows,
the general pattern of results is quite consistent with those we discuss in
the text.
33.

In the short run, the rate of inflation in the U.S. falls below the

long-run rate of six percent. The growth of foreign prices, however, is
relatively unaffected by the policy change. In the long run, rates of
inflation in the U.S. and abroad again are equal (at six percent), but the

52

ratio of price levels is different from the ratio in the old steady state.

34. The procedure involves the solution of the general equilibrium model
under steady-state constraints. In the constrained system we iterate over
capital stocks and ownership shares (y and y*) as well as prices. SteadyState values for capital stocks and ownership shares have been attained
when (1) the derived industry Q's are equal to the steady-state values and
(2) the wealth accumulation patterns of households imply no changes in the
ownership shares.

35. This technique is similar to the approach of Fair and Taylor (1983).
