PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF NARXET TIMERS

ABSTRACT

Previous investigators have shown that the Sharpe measure
of the performance of a managed portfolio may be flawed when

the portfolio manager has market timing ability.
We develop the exact conditions under which the Sharpe
measure will completely and correctly order market timers

according to ability.

The derived conditions are necessary,

sufficient, and observable.

We compare them to empirical

estimates of actual market conditions, and find that the
circumstances which can lead to a failure of the Sharpe
measure do in fact occur.

We show, however, that such

failures can be greatly reduced by more frequent sampling.

error is likely to occur in

practice by developing the exact condition under which the

Sharpe measure will fail to order timers according to
ability.

We re-examine the condition specified by Dybvig

and Ross, and derive one which is both necessary and
sufficient.

We then test that requirement against data

presented by Nerton

[8]

and show that the Sharpe measure is

in fact likely to be deficient under actual market
conditions given the current industry practice of using

quarterly data.

Empirical Estimates

is that although

As Dybvig-Ross noted, mismeasurement

reach a point (T) where reversals begin to occur.
It is fascinating that, even though the source of nonnormality is shifts
in portfolio composition, the point at which reversals occur (T) does not

The above result

states that the higher the Sharpe measure of the market, the greater the

Thus, the conditions for the Sharpe

measure to order timers incorrectly according to ability do seem to occur
frequently.

The table also suggests that monthly observations would greatly
