Tax evasion,

the illegal underreporting of income,

is

now

recognized to be significant and growing in a number of
industrialized economies.'

It encompasses understatement and

deception about income producing activities that are reported on
tax returns, as well as the non—reporting of income producing
activities in the so—called "underground economy."

Tax avoidance,

the legal use of tax loopholes, has long been a common practice

afforded by a myriad of tax laws.

Both tax avoidance and tax

evasion activity, which we lump together under the term tax
aversion,

occasion real resource costs.

An accounting of the

costs to society of running a tax system should include the cost
of tax aversion activity as well as the governmentts cost of tax
enforcement.

Recognizing both kinds of costs, one of the main

purposes of this paper is to present an analysis that indicates
that the optimal point on a stylized Laffer curve occurs on the

positively sloped region—-not at the maximum point of the curve.
Wiile concern regarding the possibility of being on the negatively
sloped region of a Laffer curve is not misplaced, our analysis
suggests that such concern should properly extend to the
positively sloped region above the optimal point as well.

Given

this result, our analysis suggests that indexation to inflation of
a marginally progressive income tax structure

may

be warranted by

considerations of economic efficiency.
Our analysis eschews the usual supply—side-type rationale for
the Laffer curve which is variously based on the incentive effects
of tax rates on total output and tax revenue,

typically by way of

the labor—leisure and/or saving and investment—capital

2

accumulation decisions.2 Rather we show that a Laffer curve can
arise solely as a consequence of the optimizing tax aversion
behavior of a utility maximizing economic agent.

That is,

changing tax rates yield a Laffer curve eyen when the economic
agent's total income from all activities is assumed constant, or
in other words, even when the usual tax effects on the labor—

leisure decision are ignored.

At the appropriate point we will

indicate why recognition of the usual effects does not modify our
conclusions in any substantive way.
In section I we show

how

the relationship between the

statutory tax rate and optimizing tax aversion behavior gives rise
to an expected tax rate.

Section II examines the determination of

the optimal level of tax enforcement and the optimal tax rate,

and

considers the nature of the deadweight losses that can arise when
the statutory tax rate is set too high.

Section III shows how a

marginally progressive income tax structure and inflation can
generate such losses.

Section IV concludes with a comparison of

the relative merits of two alternative strategies for avoiding
these losses: periodic discretionary tax cuts, and income tax
indexation.

I.

Section V summarizes and concludes the paper.

Tax Aversion Behavior and the Expected Tax Rate
The ensuing analysis focuses on the utility maximizing

representative economic agent who engages in tax aversion, which
encompasses both tax avoidance and evasion behavior

Tax aversion

has associated costs such as, for instance, the use of the agent's

3

own time to investigate and carry out aversion activities, and/or
the hiring of expert advice and assistance provided by accountants
and tax attorneys. The extent to which the

optimizing

economic

agent finds it worthwhile to engage in tax aversion is assumed to
depend on the relationship between the statutory tax rate, the
costs of tax aversio., the probability that tax evasion will

be

detected (not avoidance which is legal), and the fine if
detected.

l.a

The Effect of Tax Rates on Tax Aversion
The literature on the theoretical

analysis of tax evasion

within an expected utility framework is fairly extensive; that on
tax avoidance is less

A case can be made that the two

activities should be analyzed jointly.

Cross and Shaw (1982) have

argued that a joint analysis is called for because of the
possibilities of substitutability and complementarity. For
instance, any reduction in the probability of detection of tax
evasion or in the penalty for evasion will raise the rate of
return on evasion relative to that on avoidance activity.
Similarly, any increase in the availability of avoidance loopholes
will likely increase avoidance relative to evasion activity.
Furthermore, Cross and Shaw point out that because certain evasion
(avoidance)
(evasion)

activities can affect the marginal cost of avoidance

activities,

the costs of engaging in evasion and

avoidance should be modeled as interdependent. For instance, an
accountant or attorney paid to advise on tax avoidance might

provide information on tax evasion possibilities,

unwittingly or

otherwise.
In Cross and Shaw's analysis of tax aversion expected utility
depends on both tax avoidance and tax evasion activities with
their interdependent costs to the taxpayer represented by a joint
cost function.

Assume that income Y is the agent's total income

from all activities,

earned in both the underground and above

ground economy, in both legal and illegal activities.

Given a

proportional income tax rate t, assuming declining absolute risk

This result is of

interest in view of some recent empirical findings by Clotfelter

(l985). Using over 47,000 individual

U.S. tax

returns for 1969 ciotfelter estimates the elasticity of tax
evasion with respect to marginal tax rates to be significantly
positive.

difficulty separating income from tax rate effects and concludes

level of the expected tax rate desired to finance such spending.11
The process and objectives which determine the government's total
spending are, like the level of its desired expected tax rate,
simply taken as given for the purposes of this analysis.

Rather government

expenditure levels determined by other objectives will dictate the
need for a given desired level of the expected tax rate and the
optimal setting of t, F, and p to satisfy equations (l2)—(l5), as
previously discussed.

However, what if the government expenditure

levels dictated by these other objectives are so high that the
given expected tax rate required to finance them exceeds the
maximum optimal expected tax rate?

Then we have the ingredients

for a structural deficit-—a situation where government

expenditures outstrip the capacity to finance them with tax
revenue.

II.c

Overshooting the Optimal Tax Rate:

A Deadweight Loss

In the ensuing discussion we will use the term "optimal tax
rate" to refer to that value of the statutory tax rate given by

equations (12)—(15), the equations which give the optimal values
of t, F, and p for a given desired level of the expected tax rate.
For example, in Figure 2 suppose ta is the optimal value of

and that tax brackets are defined according to nominal income
levels.

IV.

Discretionary Tax Cuts versus Income Tax Indexation
One way to keep bracket creep from driving t

the

discretionary reduction of marginally progressive tax rates
whenever bracket creep pushes

While such cuts could in principle maintain

(i.e., optimal levels of F and p), in practice inflation-generated

At a practical level then, it can be argued that

income tax indexing will prevent bracket creep from pushing t past

the peak of the agent's Laffer curve, or if already past it, at
least prevent further increases in the deadweight loss associated

with movement down the negatively—slopedregion of the curve.

Conclusion
It has been shown that due to tax aversion behavior there is

associated with any statutory tax rate a corresponding

lower

expected tax rate, defined as the fraction of a dollar of income
Because

to a point on the

positively sloped region of the economic agent's Laffer curve.
Furthermore,

there is an upper limit on the level of the expected

tax rate that the government can achieve optimally, and it too

corresponds to a point on the positively sloped region of a Laffer
curve.

Given a desired level of the expected tax rate (assumed less
than or equal to the upper limit) and the associated optimal
setting of the statutory tax rate, society suffers deadweight
losses if the statutory tax rate is set higher than the optimal
level.

Given a marginally progressive

tax structure,

such

deadweight losses are particularly likely when there is inflation.
It may be argued that such losses are best avoided by indexing the

marginally progressive tax structure to inflation rather than by
periodically cutting statutory tax rates.

21
Finally,

from an efficiency standpoint,

the proper question

is not is the statutory tax rate above the point where the Laffer

curve's slope becomes negative? Rather is the statutory tax rate
above the lower rate corresponding to the optimum point on the
positively sloped region of the curve?

Revenue Service report on this subject; also note the

extensive citations to research in the area cited by

In these studies, tax evasion refers to

income taxes individuals and corporations should pay but
do not, encompassing income earned from both legal and
illegal activity.

lost in the United States in 1981 due to unreported
incomes, an amount approximately equal to 22 percant of
total federal corporate and personal income taxes

unreported legal income and another $9.0 billion due to
unreported income earned in illegal activities.

summarized findings in several countries and reports
that in general the Scandinavian countries, West
Germany, and the United Kingdom have unrecorded economic

activity (therefore untaxable) comparable to that of the
United States where such activity amounted to
approximately 12 percent of national income in 1979;
such activity was estimated to equal 20—25 percent of

Analysis focusing on tax evasion has origins in the
expected utility analysis of Allingham and Sandso
