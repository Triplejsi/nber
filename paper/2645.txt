In a simple model, Robert Lucas (1978) shows that there is a unique

relationship between the level of economic activity and the value of the
stock market. The tight relationship between real activity and asset
prices carries over to more complicated and realistic models where no simple
solutions

are available.

Yet, the lessons from this paper do not rely upon

a specific model of asset pricing.

The null hypothesis is that the
