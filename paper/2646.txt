The Impact of the Agencies on Conventional Fixed—Rate Mortgage Yields

Patric H. Hendershott and ,James D. Shilling

Tha fedaral agencies' role in the conventional fixed-rate mortgage market
has expanded sherply in the 1980s.

FNMA purchased some conventional mortgages

in the 1970s, but at the end of the decade its portfolio of conventional
single—family mortgages was still under $20 billion.

Also, while FHLMC's

pass-through program existed in the 1970s, the outstanding level of its pass—
throughswas also still under $20 billion at the end of the decade.

In

contrast, FNMA initiated its pass-through program in 1g82 and issues for both

of the agencies exploded, rising to nearly $150 billion per

in

1986—87.

The best measure of the agencies' expanded role is the increase in the
percentage of "new" conventional fixed-rate loans (generally defined as less
than one year since origination) eligible for secoritization that are, in fact,
securitized by FHLMC and FNMA.

Column 8 in Table

1

shows that the percentage

of new conventional FRMs secoritized by these agencies has increased from 3 to
40 percent in the l98Ds.

Moreover, about a quarter of FRMs, the so-called

jumbo loans, cannot be secoritized by the agencies becaose the size of these
loans exceeds the conforming loan limit.

Dividing column 8 by 0.75, the share

of new conforming FRNs securitized in recent years is thus seen (column
be in excess of 50 percent.

to

That is, in five years the agencies have gone from

a negligible participant to the dominant player in the market for conforming
FRMs.
The principal hypothesis tested in this paper is that the recent
dominance of the conforming FRN market by the agencies has reduced new issoe
yields on conforming loans relative to those on jumbo loans.

The test consists

of an analysis and comparison of yields on samples of conventional FRMs closed

and 1986 (1,875 loans),
Concentrating on one state

allows os to ignore many regional effects, such as variations in state
foreclosure laws, on yields.

Moreover, California accounts for a substantial

frsction of the dollar volume of all FRMs closed, 27 percent in 1986, and of
jumbo FRMs closed, 53 percent in 1986.

We begin with a discussion of the data examined, report some empirical
estimates, and close by summarizing the results and drawing some implications
of the results.

We find that the increased securitization of the conventional

fixed—rate market has lowered yields on conforming loans by about 30 basis
points relative to those on large jumbo loans and yields on small jumbos (soon

to be conforming) by about 15 basis points.
I.

The Closed Loan Data

Each month since 1963, the FMLBB has conducted a survey of conventional
loans closed (loans "approved", prior to 1973) during the first five days of
the month.

The loans are on single—family non—farm residential properties,

both newly built and previously occupied.

The loans are permanent, fully

amortizing, first mortgages on properties transferred.

Thus refinancings,

second mortgages, and interim financing are excluded, although a small number
of combination constructiun-purchaae loans are included.
made by all major lenders (originators)

The loans are those

savings and loans, mutual aavings

banks, commercial banks, and mortgage bankers.

The loans have both fixed and

adjustable rates.
The survey provides the contract interest rate, initial fees and charges,
the term to maturity, the mortgage loan amount, and the purchase price of the
property.

The effective interest rate is officially calculated in the survey

as the contract rate plus the initial fees and charges amortized over ten

—3—

years; the loan—to-value ratio is the loan amount divided by purchase price.
Since 1986, the base note rate (contract rate less temporary buydowns or
discounts) for all loans and the interest rate adjustment-period and life-of—
loan rate caps for ARMs have been reported.
The interest rate survey data are easily subdivided into conforming and
jumbo loan categories.

The maximum loan size eligible for agency purchase

programs was set directly by statute from 1970 through 1980.

Since 1980, the

ceiling has been adjusted annually according to a formula incorporated in 1980
legislation.

The adjustment formula increases the limit at the beginning of

each year by the percentage change in the average purchase price for homes
financed by conventional mortgages as reported by the FHLBB during the 12—month
period ending with the previous October.

Figure 1 illustrates how the maximum

loan size limit (and that for ERA loans in high cost areas) has increased over
time

To minimize the effect of regional factors, particularly differences in
expected default losses, we decided to choose a single state for our analysis.
Given our need to include numerous jumbo loans, California was the obvious
choice.

To test the hypothesis that the relation between yields on conforming

and jumbo loans has been changed by the expanded role of the agencies in the
1980s, we chose two dates for analysis:

1978, before the agencies expanded

their activities, and 1986, by which time the agencies seemed to dominate the
conforming market.

Data for May, June and July, peak loan closing months, were

analyzed for each year.

The volumes of loans closed in these years was larger,

many times larger in some cases, than the volume in the intervening years.
The basic loan sample was reduced in five ways.

First, adjustable rate

loans were deleted; our hypothesis relates to FRMs only (the agencies
aecuritized less than 5 percent of new ARM originations in 1986).
loans by mortgage and commercial bankers were deleted.

Second,

Because only a handful

—4—

of loans originated by mortgage bankers were included in the 1986 california
sample, they had to be deleted from both dates to keep the data comparable.
commercial banks originated such a small percentage of the loans in both years
that we decided to exclude these originations also.

Because no mutual savings

banks exist (or were sampled) in california, savings and loans are the only
originators for our sample.

were excluded.

Third, combination construction—purchase loans

These were only one percent of the sample, and the contract

rate here could easily be mismeasured.

Fourth, loans with loan—to—value ratios

under 70 percent were excluded to make sure that no second mortgages or
mortgages with significant seller—financing buy downs built into the price )and
thus the loan—to—value ratio) were included.

Fifth, loans with less than 25

years term-to—maturity were excluded for similar reasons.

Sixth, the 28 loans

in 1986 that had a base rate below the coupon rate were deleted.
The distributions of the 1978 and 1986 data samples, broken down by
loan-to—value ratio and loan size )as a percentage of the conforming loan
limit), are given in Tables 2 and 3.

Over seventy percent of the loans in our

sample had 70 to 80 percent loan—to—value ratios )over ninety—five percent of
the 80 to 84.9 percent loans are 80 percent loans) , and about a fifth of all
loans were jumbos.

In 1978, all the jumbos had loan-to—value ratios under 85

percent; in 1986, jumbos constituted over a tenth of loans with loan—to—value
ratios above 85 percent.

In 1978, fifty—nine percent of the loans were less

than 80 percent of the conforming limit and twenty—eight percent were between
80 and 115 percent.

By 1986, these percentages had shifted to forty—seven and

thirty—nine, respectively.
One additional point about the data:

they are extremely "noisy."

More

specifically, the effective FRM rate at a given point in time for loans at or
under the conforming loan limit with similar loan—to—value ratios varies by as

much as 4 to 5 percentage points!

To illustrate, in June 1986, the 306 loans

—5—

closed with loan—to-value ratios of 75 to 80 percent had effective loan rates
ranging from 7.47 to 11.67 percent (mean of 10.40, standard deviation of 0.45)
For the 156 loans with loan-to-value ratios of 85 to 90 percent, the range was

an even wider 8.71 to 13.97 percent
0.67) .

(mean of 10.60, standard deviation

of

While variation of up to 1½ percentage points could conceivably be

rationalized (and over 95 percent of the loan rates fall within this range(
owing to differences in the date the loan was originated and in loan size, the
observed larger variation implies significant reporting errors.1
The apparent significant reporting errora suggest three things.

Firat, a

large data sample ia needed ao that the errors will not diatort the results;
the significance (and plauaibility) of our estimates improved noticeably when
we went from one to three months of data in each year.2

Second, the data cells

should be chosen carefully to insure ample data pointa.

Third, our ability to

'explain

the effective loan rate data will not be great.

II.

The Empirical Results

Variationa in effective FRM yields on conventional loana originated in a
particular region of the country at a given point in time ahould be
aysteaatically related to two variables:
to—value ratio.

the aize of the loan and the loan—

The effective rate should decline with loan aize because the

costs of originating and servicing contracts per dollar of loan decrease as the
loan size increases.

The effective rate should riae, at an increaaing rate,

with the loan—to—value ratio (after it exceeds, say, 80 percent) because
expected losses from default increase.

(Effective rates on equal—sized loans

collateralized by equal—valued houses may vary across regions because the
expected losses from default may vary owing to differences in expected houae
price inflation/volatility and/or in state foreclosure laws.)

—6—

To test the hypothesis that the loan rate declines with loan size, we

have computed the average effective rates on loans of increasing size (percent
of the conforming loan limit( for loans with similar loan—to—value ratios
to 80 percent(

.

This

(75

also provides a crude test of the main hypothesis that

the relationship between qualifying and jumbo loan ratea changed between 1978
and 1986.
The data in Table 4 provide support for both hypotheses.

First, consider

the declines in effective rates for both 1978 and 1986 as the loan size risea
from under half the conforming limit to the limit.

Second, note the sharp rate

jump at the loan limit in 1986, in contrast to the leveling off in 1978.

In

fact, the 26 basis—point jump for loans 91—100 percent of the limit to loans
equal to 101—115 percent may understate the impact of the agencies' expansion.
The 101-115 percent rate may be lower in 1986 than it would be in the absence

of the agency expansion because these loans would be under the limit within a
year

(the limit increased

by 15 percent on January 1, 1987(

Table 4 also contains data on the contract loan rate and standard
deviations of the effective and contract rates.

The contract rates follow

roughly the same pattern as the effective rate.

The standard deviations are a

little higher for smaller loans (under 80 percent of the conforming limit(
Somewhat aurprisingly, the standard deviations for the contract rata are
slightly amaller than those for the effective rate; we expected that accounting
for points would reduce the dispersion in contract rates.
With this encouragement, we have proceeded to a formal teat of the
hypotheses by running OLS regressions, for 1978 and again for 1986, of the
form:

The independent variable is the effective loan rate, r,, for each of the 4,870

implies roughly s

may explain the similarity of the coefficients on these two

Finally, the rate for new properties is about 7 basis points less

than that for existing properties.
Now for the coefficients that changed from 1978 to 1986.

Of course, the

intercepts and June and July dummy coefficients are different because the level
and evolution of mortgage rates in the spring of the two years was different.
Also different, though, is the coefficient on the conforming loan dummy.

The

coefficient declines from —5 basis points in 1978 to —29 basis points in 1986.

That is, the expanded activities of the agencies seem to have lowered yields on
conforming loans by 24 basis points relative to yields on jumbo loans.
The second equation for 1986 in Table S tests a more sophisticated
hypothesis:

agency activities lowered the rates on jumbo loans just above the

loan limit as well as those on loans below the loan limit.

Because the limit

was raised by 15 percent on January 1, 1987, only six to eight months after the
loans were closed in May—July, a dummy variable was created for all loans
between 100 and 115 percent of the 1986 conforming limit.
encompasses 27 percent of jumbo loans closed.

This range

The addition of the just—over—

the—limit dummy has a negligible impact on the coefficients for loan size and
the loan—to-value and new—property dummies.

However, the coefficient on the

just—over—the—limit dummy is statistically different from zero, and the
coefficient on the conforming loan dummy increases by
absolute value.

basis points in

According to these estimates, the expanded securitization of

the agencies lowered the loan rates on qualifying loans by roughly 3S basis
points and those on "soon to be" qualifying loans by 20 basis points.
This hypothesis csn be refined even further.

While the loan limit

increased by 15 percent on January 1, 1987, this increase was not known when
the loans closed in May—July 1986 were originated.

Nonetheless, such an

—9—

increase was highly likely because the index had risen at a 22 percent annual
rate over the first half of the adjustment period, October 1985 to March 1986.

On the other hand, a loan—rate impact could well exist on loans just above

115

percent of the conforming limit because a reasonable possibility existed that
these loans would fall under the limit in 1987 or if not then in 1g88.

We note that the R2 are roughly 10

percent higher when the coupon rates, rather than effective rates, are
explained, and, more importantly, the equation standard errors are 15 to 20
percent lower,

on these grounds we prefer the estimates in Table 6 to those in

Table 5.

By these estimates, the agencies hays lowered yields on conforming and
just—above conforming loans by 30 and 15 basis points, respectively, relative
to yields on large jumbo loans.

The 30 basis point spread between yields on

large—jumbo and conforming loans is at the low end of the observed spread
between yields on private and agency pass-through securities

(Woodward, 1987)

Thus, yields on large jumbo loens mey be being set by the private securitizers,
rather than by traditional portfolio lenders.

Summary and Implicationa

Our analysia of conventional FRMa cloaed in California in May-July of
1978 and 1986 auggests that the loan rate depends on the loan-to-value ratio,
the loan size, and in 1986, whether the loan is far above, just above, or below
the conforming loan limit.

Loans with loan—to-value ratios of 90 percent have

rates 10 basis points higher than loans with 80 percent ratios, and $60,000
loans

(in 1986(

have rates 10 basis points higher than $130,000 loans.

Moreover, in 1986 the rates on loans far above the conforming loan limit exceed
those on otherwise comparable loans below the conforming loan limit by 30 basis
points and those on loans destined to exceed the limit within a year by 15
basis points.

That is, the expanded agency securitization of conventional FRNs

has significantly lowered the rates on both conforming loans and loans somewhat
above the conforming limit (27 percent of jumbo loans in l986( relative to what
they would otherwise have been.

While the analysis was restricted to

California, this state accounted for roughly one-quarter of the dollar volume
of all conventional FElls closed in 1986 and over half of all jumbos closed.
Of interest is when this conforming loan—rate impact first occurred.

The

data in Table 1 suggest that the agencies' share of the new origination market
for conforming FRMs did not exceed fifty percent until 1986, but conceivably
the thirty—six percent share in 1985 was sufficient to determine prices.

A

brief examination of rates on loans closed in May-July 1985 suggests that this
was not the case.

Yields on conforming 75 to 80 percent loan—to-value loans

exceeded those on similar jumbo loans.

Thus 1986 seems to be the first year of

the agency impact on FRN rates.
The effects of a 30 basis point lower FRM rate are many, and some of them
could be significant in magnitude.

Households are more likely to choose FRMs

than ARMs, to decide to own rather than rent,

and to own larger houses.

Traditional mortgage portfolio lenders will have fewer ARMs to purchase and

—12—

will earn lower returns on FRM investments.

We conclude our paper with a few

sample calculations to illustrate the possible magnitudes of some of these
effects.
Brueckner and Follain (1988)

and Ohillon, Shilling and Sirmans (1987)

have recently estimated equations explaining the household FRM/ARM decision.
Using the Brueckner—Follain estimates, a 30 basis point decline in the FRM
rate, at spring 1986 interest rate levels, would have lowered the ARM share

from 65 percent to 29 percent.9

In the 1988 environment of a wider FRM—ARM

rste spread (assumed 50 basis—point lower ARM rate) ,
would lower the ARM share from 95 to 75 percent.

same FRN rate decrease

Using the Ohillon—Shilling-

Sirmans estimates gives impacts about half as large.

to us.

the

These seem more plausible

Thus we conclude that the lower FRM rate induced by the agencies

probably lowered the ARM share of new originations in recent years by 10 to 20
percentage points.

A 30 basis point decline in the FRM rate would have a large negative
long—run impact on returns to traditional FRM portfolio investors. To
illustrate, say that such investors could expect to earn a 15 percent pretax
return, in the absence of the 30 basis point FRM rate decline, by investing 96
cents of debt and 4 cents of equity in a dollar of mortgages.

A 30 basis point

decline in the FRM rate would halve the expected return on equity (to below the
return on Treasuries) .

Moreover, the tilt in households toward FRMs would

reduce the ARMs available for portfolio investment.
Finally, a lower FRM rate would raise homeownership and the quantity of
housing demanded by owners.

This impact is not large, however.

For example,

if the elasticity of housing demand with respect to the user cost is negative
unity, then housing demand would increase by less than 2 to 2½

percent.1°

Because most price—elasticity estimates are closer to —0.5 (Mayo,

1981 and

Goodman, 1988), the expected increase in demand is closer to one percent.

The above is not meant to be either a full list of potential effects of a
lower FRM rate or a full analysis of the effects considered.

For jumbo loans, more variation might be expected.

Borrowers of such loans

can be highly desirable customers for whom landers may lower the borrowing rate
in order to establish an ongoing relationship.

For example, the effective rate

on a jumbo loan may be reduced depending on the size and number of certificates
of deposit placed in the lender's institution by the borrower.
