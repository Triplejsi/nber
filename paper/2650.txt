THE EFFECTS OF FISCAL POLICY ON INTERNATIONAL
JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES

IMBALANCES:

ABSTRACT
Evidence from three multicountry models is used to assess the currentaccount effects of U.S. and Japanese fiscal
policies.

Asymmetries in the

effects of U.S. and Japanese policies are
analyzed in some detail, and

attribuced to differences

in country size, in trade patterns (which have

only a small effect) and in the extent to which induced changes in real
exchange rates switch demand from domestic to foreign output.

Fiscal

policy has aubstantial current account effeccs in the models.

For example,

switching $50 billion of suatained government

spending from the United States

to Japan would, in the third year, improve the U.S. current account
by
$24 billion and worsen that of Japan by $20 billion.

Induced changes in

nominal exchange rates are found to play a relatively small role in determining the effects of fiscal policy on the nominal current account.

The Effects of Fiscal Policy on International Imbalances:
Japan and the United States

1. Introduction

To what extent do the current account imbalances among the major industrial
countries, the Asian NlCs and the heavily indebted countries of South and North
America represent the inevitable counterparts of fiscal imbalances? To what
extent are these imbalances likely to respond to changes in fiscal policies in

the major industrial countries? To what extent are exchange rate changes

a

necessary part of translating changes in fiscal policy into changes in external
balances? These are three of the key issues facing domestic and international
macroeconomic policy. This paper attempts to address these issues by using
evidence from three major multicountry models to explain the effects that

fiscal policies in Japan and the United States have on their own current
account balances as well as on the current balance of the other country.

There has already been a substantial amount of quantitative research on the
linkages between fiscal policies and the current account of the United States.

Most of the existing multinational models were involved in a comparative
exercise in 1985, in which one of the major experiments involved comparing the
international effects of fiscal policies in the United States and in the rest
of the OECD (ROECD).1 The sources of the U.S. current account deficit,
including the roles of divergent fiscal policies in the United States and the

rest of the OECD, treated as a single unit, were the subject of a workshop at

the Brookings Institution in January 1987, based on results from a number of
major multicountry models.2

The EPA symposium extends the earlier work in a number of respects: the

research is symmetric in its consideration of the Japanese and United States
current accounts, the perspective is forward-looking, and the structure of the
Japanese economy is being studied in some detail, both on its own and in
comparison with other countries.

In addition,

more attention is paid to the

the other country's current account, and

to the explanation of any asymmetries that may appear when the effects of

Japanese and U.S. policies are compared. Three multicountry models were used to
prepare evidence for the seminar: those

of

the Japanese Economic Planning

Agency (the EPA World Model, referred to here as EPA). the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board (the MultiCountry Model, referred to here as MCM), and the OECD (the
INTERLINK model, referred to here as OECD).

This paper deals principally with the current account effects of fiscal

policies, based on simulation experiments run over a six year horizon extending
from 1987 through 1992. The figures drawn for this paper show results over the
whole six years. while the analytical tables explaining the current account
effects in more detail concentrate on the first-year and third-year results of
the changes in fiscal policy. The typical fiscal policy change studied is a

presented in Bryant, Hoitham and Hooper,
eds., (1988) showed (e.g. Helkie and Hooper 1988, p. 48) that divergent fiscal
policies in the United States and the rest of the OECD could explain most of
the U.S. current account deficit that emerged during the 1980s.

sustained increase in real government spending equal to 1% of baseline real
GNP. Money supplies are held fixed and exchange rates are flexible in the

experiments that are the main focus of this paper. Comparable results under
fixed exchange rates will, however, be used to show the role that exchange rate
movements play in determining the link between budget deficits and external
deficits.

The paper starts with an overview of some of the main features of the new
evidence, including comparisons with the results prepared for the earlier

Brookings conference. The analysis then turns to

a

more intensive examination

of the reasons for some of these results. This is done in two sections, section
3 dealing with the reasons

for some of the asymmetries in the current-account

effects of Japanese and US. fiscal policies, and section 4 briefly analyzing
the role of exchange rate movements in establishing the relationship between

fiscal policies and international imbalances. The final section then summarizes
the results and draws some implications for the analysis

from the same experiments, of U.S. fiscal expansion.4 The top panels of figure

show the U.S. current account effects separately for each of the three models

(EPA, MCM, and OECD) involved in the EPA Symposium. By showing comparable
results for the 1985 and 1988 experiments, these figures are especially useful
in revealing any major changes in model structure between the two sets of

experiments. The bottom right two panels of figure 3 compare the 1985 and 1988
results, from the same three models, for the effects of U.S. fiscal policy on
the Japanese current balance.

In terms of the first-year

of income in response to fiscal policies, the top

show almost complete symmetry between U.S. and ROECD fiscal

policies, with each region's fiscal expansion raising real GNP at home by
1.25%, in response to a fiscal expansion equal to 1% of GNP, with real GNP in
the other region rising by O.25%. This apparent symmetry is actually the net

result of three asymmetries, however, as the larger size of the ROECD, which
would tend

to make the

transmission larger from the ROECD to the United States

than vice versa, is offset by the net effect of two other factors. These are
the higher propensity to import in the ROECD5 and the fact that 50% of U.S.

imports come from the ROECD, while only

12% of ROECD

imports come from the

smaller from the United States to the ROECD, is more than offset by the

United States.

This initial equality of transmission soon disappears, however, as the

domestic income effects of the U.S. fiscal expansion are crowded out by the
higher prices, exchange rates (except for OECD), and interest rates, and an
increasing proportion of the induced income is in the ROECD. By contrast, the
ROECO income multiplier remains much higher, with much smaller induced
increases in the price level, in the value of the domestic currencies, and in

interest rates. The bottom right-hand panel of figure 2 shows the substantial
extent to which the U.S. current account continues to weaken in response to the

fiscal expansion, with the average induced current account deficit being about
0.5% of GNP by the sixth year of the fiscal expansion.

The upper panels of figure 2 show the Current account effects of U.S.
fiscal expansion on a model-by-model basis for the EPA, MCM and OECD models,
with the 1985 and 1988 results compared, expressed both in terms of billion
U.S. dollars (on the left-hand side of the page) and as percent of GNP. Looking

first at the 1985 results from the three models, the EPA and MCM results show
the U.S. current account worsening by more than the average across all twelve

models, while the OECD current account effects are smaller than average and
show little tendency to grow over the six years.

Comparing the 1985 and 1988 results, it can be seen that
the models have changed slightly, so as to move their estimated U.S. current

account effects closer to each other, and to the average from the 1985
experiments. Thus all three models now show the U.S. current account

6
consequences growing with time, and to be between 0.5% and 0.7% of GNP by the
sixth year of the fiscal expansion.

Turning to figure

3, illustrating the effects of fiscal expansion on

the

Japanese current balance, the bottom right-hand panels show that in 1985 the
EPA model showed by far the largest Japanese effects

of

U.S. fiscal policy,

growing with time to reach almost 2% of GNP by the sixth year. In the 1988
results, these effects have been cut in half, although they are still somewhat

larger than those of the MCM, and twice as high as those of the OECD model. In
all three models the effects of U.S. fiscal expansion on the Japanese current

balance are as great as on the U.S. current balance, and somewhat higher in the
case of EPA, where the effects are measured as a percent of baseline GNP in all
cases.

The top half of figure 3 contains the new results showing the Japanese

current account effects of Japanese fiscal expansion. These are largest for
EPA, but in all three models are less than one half as large as the effects of
U.S. fiscal policy, as shown in the bottom half of the figure. All three models
show the Japanese fiscal expansion to worsen the Japanese current account by
about 500 billion Yen in the first year, as shown by the top right-hand panel
of figure 3. Thereafter, the EPA effects continue to grow, while the MCM
effects remain fairly constant and the OECD effects gradually disappear.

As seen by comparing figures
estimates

of the

effects

of

2 and 3,

the three models give very similar

U.S. fiscal policy on the U.S. current account, but

rather different estimates of the effects of Japanese fiscal expansion on the

7

Japanese current account. To understand these differences better, we can
exploit the fact that the current account is simply the difference between
private investment and the sum of gross private saving and net saving of the

public sector. Similarly, any worsening in the real current account deficit in
response

to fiscal stimulus can be expressed

equally well as the amount by

which induced absorption exceeds induced real output. To make use of these
alternative ways of viewing the current account, figure 4 shows the own-country
effects of fiscal expansions in terms of real GNP, real absorption, gross
private savings and gross private investment.6

Looking first at the results for Japan, the EPA model's increases in real

absorption and GNP, with real absorption steadily rising to

a level 2% above

baseline by the sixth year, show that the growing current account effects shown
in figure 3 are not the result of crowding out, but of imports increasing with

absorption and income as all three continue

to grow. For

the other two models,

the real GNP and domestic absorption effects are both crowded out; for the MCM
some of this crowding out takes the form of increased real imports, but in
neither case is there a widening gap between absorption and GNP. Thus in none
of the three models is there evidence

of

by increasing real import penetration. The
a

panel showing private investment as

share of GNP reveals that the crowding out of domestic absorption that takes

place in MCM and OECD is of private investment, which is slightly above
6 The
matching results for the induced changes in the government balance
as a share of GNP, which reveal the extent to which additional tax revenues
serve to finance the increase in government spending (equal to 1% of GNP), are
shown in the second-row panels of figures 5, 7, and 9, which contain the modelby-model results for EPA, MCM and OECD, respectively. Since the government
spending is financed by borrowing, the cumulating debt also increases
government spending further through its impact on public debt charges.

baseline throughout for EPA, but increasingly below baseline for MCM, and
especially for OECD.

The situation is quite different in the case of the United States. Here,
all the models agree that the current account deficit will continue to grow as
a share of baseline GNP, reaching 0.5% by the sixth year. As shown by figure 4,
however, this agreement about the current account effects is the net result of

some offsetting differences. Although all three models show declining real
multipliers for the United States, the first-year multiplier is about 1.75 for
MCM compared to about 1.0 for the OECD, with EPA midway between.

Although all three models show steady crowding out

as

of the

U.S. GNP effects

time progresses, the MCM multiplier falls much less slowly than the other

two, and is still above 1.0 in the sixth year. There is an offsetting

difference in the behaviour of real absorption, which is continually falling,
relative to its initial increase, in MCM and OECD, while consistently remaining
roughly 1.5% above baseline values for

EPA.

Higher investment is the key to the

sustained absorption in EPA, with investment higher by almost 1% of GNP by the

sixth year. In the other two models, investment is below baseline by increasing
amounts, averaging about 0.25% of GNP over the six year period.

The models also reveal some substantial differences in U.S. private savings
behaviour, with savings up by much more than the induced change in GNP in OECD.
up only slightly in MCM, and with the EPA falling in between. The EPA estimate
of induced private savings (as a % of GNP) continually rises, thus helping to

finance the growing government deficit.

Figures 5 through 10 broaden the focus to consider both the own-country and
the cross-country effects
comparative

of

Japanese and U.S. and fiscal policies on a

basis. To do this, there are two figures for each of the three

models. The left-hand panels of each figure show the own-country and crosscountry effects of Japanese fiscal expansion, while the right-hand panels do
the same for U.S. fiscal expansion. What are the main points of similarity and
difference revealed by these figures?

Important points of similarity include:

-

In all three models, U.S. fiscal

policy has large and growing effects on

the current accounts of both countries, with the effects on Japan being about

as large as those on the United States, when measured as percent of GNP.

- In all three models, Japanese fiscal policy initially affects the Japanese
current balance by about as much as does the U.S. fiscal expansion (although of
course in the opposite direction), while the influence on the U.S. current
account is close to zero.

-

In

all three models, U.S. interest rates rise by substantial amounts that

increase as the U.S. fiscal expansion continues.

y

the sixth year, U.S. long-

term rates are 150 to 200 basis points higher in nominal terms. Japanese
interest rates are pulled up by about one-third as much (less in MCM) in

response to the U.S. fiscal expansion.

10

- In all three models, U.S. fiscal expansion produces continuing U.S.
inflation averaging about 0.5% annually in each of the models. Thus real longterm interest rates are 100 to 150 basis points higher by the sixth year.

-

In all three models, U.S. fiscal expansion produces

a substantial change in

the U.S. unemployment rate, while Japanese fiscal expansion has almost

no

impact on the Japanese unemployment rate.

The most striking of these results is the contrast between the very large
current account effects of U.S. fiscal expansion and the much smaller effects
of Japanese fiscal expansion. This asymmetry has been the subject of much
comment, and will be analyzed in some detail in the next section of the paper.

Important differences among the models include:

- Although all three models show the Japanese GNP effects of U.S. fiscal
expansion to be greater than the U.S. effects by the sixth year, the difference
is much greater

for

EPA, which shows Japanese GNP up by over 2% by the fifth

year. This appears to reflect a possibly non-convergent real multiplier process
in the Japanese block

-

of

the EPA model.

Although none of the models shows large changes in the Japanese price level

in response to Japanese fiscal expansion, there are noticeable differences
among the models. There is no induced inflation in EPA, despite the much
stronger multiplier process in operation in that model.

11
-

By contrast, in response to U.S. fiscal expansion, the EPA model shows

substantial Japanese inflation, even more than in the United States over the
first two years, while MCM shows about one-third as much inflation as in the
United States and the OECD almost none.

-

In both EPA and MCM, the U.S. dollar appreciates

by about 3% in nominal

terms in response to U.S. fiscal expansion, while the OECD model shows a
depreciation of the dollar.

-

In real terms, MCM shows the real value of the

dollar returning to baseline

by the sixth year, while EPA shows a real appreciation of about 4%

and OECD a

real appreciation of about 2%.

- The initial depreciation of the dollar in OECD under U.S. fiscal expansion
appears to be related primarily to the movement of short-term interest rates
outside the United States. In that model, Japanese short-term rates rise almost

as much as U.S. rates in response to U.S. fiscal expansion, while the induced
changes in Japanese interest rates are much smaller in the other two models.7

-

All three models show initial appreciation of the yen in response to

Japanese fiscal expansion, although by the sixth year the combination of price
and exchange rate changes are such that the real value of the yen is up by 2%

Viewed ri terms of conventional LM and BP curves, a depreciation in
response to fiscal expansion arises if the LM curve is flatter than the BP
curve. The rise in foreign interest rates can be treated as an upward shift of
the BP curve, increasing the chances that the LM and IS curves, after the
latter has shifted right ri response to fiscal expansion, should intersect
below the BP curve, thus indicating incipient depreciation.

3. Asymmetries

in Current Balance Effects

This section attempts to spell out in more detail why the models show that
U.S. fiscal policies have much larger effects on the Japanese current account
than vice versa. To do this most clearly,

it is

perhaps helpful to start with

the simplest case, where relative prices are initially unchanged and all
current account effects are due to increases in real imports of the country
undertaking fiscal expansion. In that simple case, the effect of U.S. fiscal
expansion on the Japanese current account depends only on the U.S. multiplier,

the U.S. marginal propensity to import, and the marginal share of U.S. imports
that comes from Japan. A similar relationship, with the names changed,
determines the effects of Japanese fiscal expansion on the U.S. current
account.

If one compares the Japanese current account effects of U.S. fiscal
expansion to the U.S. current account effects of Japanese fiscal expansion,

measuring the effects in relation to the second country's GNP, then the
relative size

of the

countries enters in two ways. First, if the fiscal

13

expansion is defined in relation to GNP, then the initial increase in spending

will be larger if the larger country expands. Second, for given trade ratios
and import propensities, any change in real trade flows will be a larger share
of the smaller country's GNP. Using purchasing power parity exchange rates8,
U.S. GNP was about

28 times as

large as that of Japan in 1987. This would

imply that if the two countries had the same propensity to import from each
other, and if both countries had the same domestic expenditure multipliers,
then U.S. fiscal expansion of 1% of U.S. GNP would affect the Japanese current

account (measured as

of Japanese GNP) by

a %

about eight times as much

(2.8x2.8=7.84) as a Japanese fiscal expansion of 1% of GNP would affect the
U.S. current account, measured as a percent of U.S. GNP.

To take a concrete example, the top right hand panels of figures

5, 7 and

9

show that U.S. fiscal expansion improves the Japanese current balance, in the
of GNP.

first year, by about 0.25%

If the structures of the two economies were

identical, in the manner described above, then one would expect to find in the

top left panel of the same figures that the U.S. current balance would improve
by about 0.03% (= 0.25/7.84) of U.S. GNP in response to the Japanese fiscal
expansion. On average over the first year, the MCM improvement is about 0.045%,
while in EPA and OECD

it

is substantially less, about 0.01%.

In the rest of this section, we shall take a more systematic look at the
nature and the sources

of these

differences, separating the influences operating through exchange rate changes,
second-round trade effects, and trade in services. This will be done by a

series of five tables, each of which builds upon the previous tables.

Table

1

starts by showing the induced real current account effects in the

expanding country. The first columns show how induced real imports can be
explained as the product of the fiscal multiplier and the marginal propensity
to import. Columns 1 and 2 show the multipliers and marginal propensities to

import under fixed exchange rates,9 and columns

3 and

4 show how these two

numbers are altered by the induced changes in exchange rates. The propensities

to import

are for merchandise only, because of the restricted information

available about service imports in real terms. The numbers in column five

for

induced real merchandise imports are thus equal to the increase in government

spending, measured in billion 1980 yen for Japan and in billion 1982 dollars
for the United States, times the flexible exchange rate multiplier (from column
3) times the marginal propensity to import (from column

Column 6 shows

a percent of baseline real GNP, while column 7 reports

the change in the real current account balance as a percent of GNP. Column

7 is

thus equal to the negative of column 6 plus any induced changes in real

merchandise exports and net real exports of services.

Comparing the results for the United States and Japan, we might expect to
find fairly similar values in column 6 for the United States and Japan,
assuming the same fiscal multipliers, since, as shown at the bottom

of the

These are obtained from the results of the fiscal expansions run with
exogenous exchange rates.
10 The
"marginal propensities" reported are not the partial effect of real
GNP on real imports, but the total change in real imports divided by the total
change in real GNP. The numbers reported in column 5 can thus be obtained
directly from the simulation output.

15

table, Japan and the United States had about the same average propensities to
import in 1987. All three models show induced real imports in the first year to
be substantially larger for the United States than for Japan: more than 50%

larger in the case of EPA, twice as large in MCM and more than three times as
large in OECD.

The reasons for the larger bulge in U.S. imports differ by model. In the
case of

EPA,

lhe import propensities are approximately the same in the two

countries, and the difference is due entirely to the larger first-year fiscal
multiplier in the United States. For MCM, the fiscal multipliers and the
marginal propensities are both about 50% larger for the United States than for
Japan. For both EPA and MCM, the differences are larger with flexible than with
fixed exchange rates, as would be expected in the light of the greater real
appreciation of the dollar11 that takes place in those models. For OECD, the
difference appears to be entirely due to a much higher U.S. marginal propensity
to

import goods. This is not due to exchange rate effects, as the U.S.

depreciates in nominal terms in that model in response to U.S. fiscal
expansion.

How do these comparisons

change when account is taken of induced real

exports of goods, and of net exports of services? For both EPA and MCM, taking
these changes into account more than offsets the higher U.S. imports of goods,

so that the induced real trade deficit is higher for Japan than for the United
States. Before discussing these effects in slightly more detait, we first
The comparison being made here is between the appreciation of the
dollar under U.S. fiscal expansion and the appreciation of the yen under
Japanese fiscal expansion.

consider tables 2 and

which spell out more systematically the sources of the

asymmetries flowing through real merchandise imports.

Table

2 simply restates the induced real imports of goods

of

real GNPs

in terms of the

the two countries, to provide raw material for table 3, which

shows indices of asymmetry and reveals their sources. The total index shown in
column

1

of table

3 is,

as discussed before, the ratio of the effects of U.S.

fiscal policy (on Japanese merchandise exports to the United States) to the
effects of Japanese fiscal expansion (on U.S. merchandise

exports to Japan),

where the fiscal expansion is 1% of real GNP and the induced real exports are

measured as percent of the exporting country's real GNP. Columns

2 to

5 of

table 3 show the components explaining the overall index of asymmetry. The
index in column

1

is the

product of the sub-indices in columns 2 to 5, and

would take the value of 1.0

if

the two countries had exactly the same size and

economic structure.

Table

3 shows that

the first-year indices of asymmetry range from about 12.

for EPA to 16. for MCM and 23. for OECD, in all cases well above the value of
7.8 that would be accounted for simply by the differences in the sizes of Japan
and the United States. For EPA, the additional asymmetry flows mainly from the

higher value of the U.S. multiplier. For MCM there is an equally large
additional effect from the higher U.S. marginal propensity

to

import. For OECD,

the high asymmetry is entirely due to a marginal propensity to import that is

more than three times as high for the United States as for Japan. Trade
patterns are not part of the explanation of the observed asymmetry,

17
States obtained 21%

of its

merchandise imports from Japan, while Japan obtained

22% of its merchandise imports from the United States.12

Tables 4 and

5 extend the analysis to

cover the entire current account in

nominal terms, thus including the effects of terms-of-trade changes along with

the effects of changes in the volumes of goods and services exports. Table

4

examines the U.S. current balance effects of U.S. and Japanese fiscal
expansion, while table 5 shows the effects

of

the same policies on the Japanese

current balance. To remove the asymmetry caused by the different size of the
expenditure increase in the two countries, the size of the Japanese fiscal
expansion is scaled up in table 4 to be equal to 1% of U.S. GNP, the same

as

the fiscal expansion in the United States. This requires the Japanese results
to be multiplied by 1.9, which is the ratio of U.S. to Japanese GNP5 in 1987,
when evaluated at average 1987 exchange rates.13 Similarly, in table 5 the size
of the U.S. fiscal expansion is scaled down to make it equal to 1%

of Japanese

GNP. The numbers in table 4 are reported in billion U.S. dollars (at 1982

prices for the real variables), while the results in table

5

are in 100 billion

yen (at 1980 prices for the real variables).

The figures in column 5 of table 4 show that, by the end of the third
12 These
percentages are based on merchandise trade data for the first
three quarters of 1987.
13 The
ratio of GNP5 at market exchange rates is used to make the fiscal
expansion the same size, in terms of U.S. dollars, in both countries, so as to
facilitate the comparisons in terms of the changes to current accounts in
nominal terms. Since market value of the yen was well above its PPP value in
1987 (almost 50% above, as reported by Blades and Roberts (1988)). this implies
that the real value of the Japanese fiscal expansion is substantially less than
in the United States, by roughly the ratio 1.9/2.8.

18

year, a $50 billion increase in U.S. spending would worsen the U.S. current
account by about $20 billion (slightly more in MCM), while a similar amount of
spending in Japan would improve the U.S. current account by $4 to $5 billion in
MCM and OECD, and about $2 billion in EPA.

In

the EPA and MCM results, the higher value of the U.S. dollar brought

about by fiscal expansion produces terms-of-trade gains (shown in column 2, and

included as part of the column

5 figure) averaging about $3 billion in

the

first year. For OECD, with its slight depreciation of the dollar in response to
either U.S. or Japanese fiscal expansion, there are terms-of-trade losses to
the United States in both cases. EPA and MCM show yen appreciation in response
to Japanese fiscal expansion, so they agree with OECD in showing-terms-of-trade
losses to the United States in this case.

Table 5 shows the effects

of

Japanese and scaled-down U.S. fiscal expansion

on the Japanese current balance, measured in 100 billion yen. In the first year

a fiscal expansion of roughly 35 hundred billion yen worsens the Japanese
current account by roughly

5 to

7 hundred billion yen if the fiscal expansion

takes place in Japan, or improves the Japanese current balance by 3.5 to 5
hundred billion yen

if the

fiscal expansion takes place in the United States.

The reasons for the differences between the results in tables 4 and

5

lie

in the higher U.S. marginal propensity to import (especially as modelled by
OECD) and in the higher U.S. multipliers, initially in EPA and throughout for
MCM. As has already been seen, the crowding out of domestic output in the
United States increases as time passes, with a larger fraction of the

19

additional U.S. spending taking the form of imports. In the way our

calculations have been made, this shows up as a higher U.S. marginal propensity
to import, which then increases the effects of the U.S. fiscal policy on the

Japanese current balance. There is less tendency for this to happen in response
to Japanese fiscal policy, so that U.S. fiscal expansion eventually has larger
effects on the Japanese current balance than does Japanese policy.

4.

In

The Role at Exchange Rates

discussions about the policies required to remove external imbalances,

there are often disagreements about the relative roles to be played by fiscal
policies and by exchange rate changes. At one extreme,

it

is argued, for

example, that a reduction in the external value of the U.S. dollar will suffice
to restore U.S. current account balance. At the other extreme, it

is

argued

that an exchange rate change is neither necessary nor desirable, and that a
drop in the value of the U.S. dollar would induce inflationary effects in the
United States and recessionary effects abroad that would remove any positive
effects on the balance of payments.

The evidence presented so far in this paper suggests that exchanges rates
do move as part of the adjustment to fiscal policy, but their relative
importance,

either as a part of the translation of fiscal actions to external

balances, or as independent instruments, remains to be assessed. This is done
in figure 11, which shows how much difference exchange rate movements make to
the income and current balance effects of fiscal policy.

20
The left-hand side of figure 11 shows the effects on Japan of Japanese

fiscal expansion, with the right-hand side doing the same for the United
States. The top panels show the exchange rate changes that are triggered by the

fiscal expansion. with all fiscal expansions showing appreciations of the local
currency except for U.S. fiscal expansion in the OECD model. The next panels
show the difference between the fiscal multipliers triggered by these changes
in exchange rates, and the bottom two rows show the resulting changes in real

net exports and in nominal current balances.

The multiplier results show a difference among the models in the real
output effects

of

exchange rate change. All three models show lower multipliers

in response to the appreciations of the yen, and MOM shows a parallel result

for the United States. OECD shows the dollar to depreciate, and has a slightly
higher multiplier as a consequence. The exception to the pattern is provided by
EPA. which shows a higher multiplier (after the second year) in response to the

appreciation of the dollar.

The current balance results show that the induced appreciations do tend to
contribute to the current account effects of the fiscal policies, but that the
contributions are a small part of the total current balance effects shown in

earlier figures. Since the induced exchange rate changes vary over time, and
among models, it is difficult to assess their contributions clearly from figure
11.

To provide

a

clearer picture, figure 12 shows the effects of 10% exogenous

depreciations, first of the yen and then of the dollar.

Figure 12 also compares the results of partial and whole-model simulations

21

of exchange rate changes to show the extent to which macroeconomic feedbacks
alter the current balance effects of exchange rate changes. The left-hand
panels show the effects of a 10% depreciation on the depreciating country's
real net exports and nominal current accounts, based on partial simulations

of

each model's current account block, while the right-hand panels show the

corresponding results from full model simulations. The top half of the page
shows the Japanese results of yen depreciation, while the bottom half shows the
U.S. effects of dollar depreciation.

For Japan. all of the models show that net exports increase about twice as
much in the partial simulations as they do in the full model results. A similar

result holds for the nominal current account balance, although here the
reduction is rather less for the OECD than for the other models.

For the United States, all of the models show even greater differences
between the partial and whole-model results than

is the case for

Japan. On

average, the 10% depreciation of the dollar improves the current account, in

the third year. by $35 billion in the partial simulations, compared to $10
billion in the full model results. The macroeconomic offsets are greatest in
EPA and rather modest in OECD. which shows substantially the largest full-model

current balance effects of dollar depreciation.

The general conclusion from the evidence presented in this section is that
while exchange rates do tend to move in response to fiscal expansion, these

movements are not in themselves a very important part of the current account
adjustment process that follows in the wake of changes in fiscal policy. The

22

comparisons between the partial and full-model results of exchange rate changes
show that the results does not come from small direct effects of exchange rates
on trade flows, but from the macroeconomic repercussions that tend to cut
absorption

ri the appreciating countries and increase inflation in the

depreciating countries, thus offsetting the effects on the current balance.

5. Conclusions

This paper has had a double purpose; to compare the structures of three
important multinational models, and to use their evidence, in conjunction with

that from other models, to analyze the effects of Japanese and United States
fiscal policies on their own and the other country's current balance. This
conclusion draws these two strands together by summarizing what the three

models have to say about the three questions presented at the beginning of the
paper.

The experiments prepared for this symposium did not attempt to estimate
the extent to which fiscal imbalances were responsible for international
imbalances, although earlier research using these and other multinational
models to determine the sources of the U.S. current account deficit suggests14
that divergent fiscal policies in the United States and the rest of the OECD
were responsible for about two-thirds of the increase in the U.S. deficit, with
the additionat appreciation of the dollar and other factors accounting for the
rest. To what extent are these imbalances likely to be reversed by changes in

Hooper, eds. (1988).

fiscal policies? This paper has considered

Only changes in

the United States

and Japan.

Based on the evidence from the three models assessed in this paper, each
$50 billion reduction in U.S. government spending is estimated to lead, by the
third year, to a $20

billion reduction in the U.S. external deficit. A similar amount of extra
spending in Japan would, by the third year, improve the U.S. current balance by
about $4 billion.15
States

to Japan

Thus shifting $50 billion of spending from the United

would improve the U.S. current balance by $24 billion in the

third year, about half of the amount of spending transferred. What about the
effects on the Japanese current account?

Increasing Japanese government spending by 3700 billion yen would, in the
third year, reduce the Japanese current account surplus by about 700 billion
yen. Reducing U.S. spending by the same amount would reduce the Japanese

current account surplus by an average of 800 billion yen.16 Thus transferring
3700 billion yen of spending (1% of Japanese GNP) from the United States to
Japan would reduce the Japanese current account surplus by about 1500 billion
15 These results are from
table 4. Relative to the typical results quoted
in the text, MCM shows effects of U.S. fiscal policy that are about 25% larger,
and EPA shows effects of Japanese fiscal policy that are about half as great,
with a third-year effect on the U.S. current account equal to $2 billion for
each $50 billion spent in Japan.
16 These
results are from table 5. There is less unanimity among the
models in their estimates of the effects of fiscal policies on the Japanese
current balance. All three models suggest, however, that U.S. and Japanese
fiscal policies have similar effects on the Japanese current balance. MCM and
EPA show rather similar results, while OECD shows effects that are roughly half
as big as for the other models.

24
yen, or about 40% of the amount of spending transferred.

Combining this evidence, the models suggest that decreasing U.S.
government spending by $50 billion, with spending in Japan increased by the

same amount, would, in the third year, reduce the U.S. current account deficit
by about $25 billion and reduce the Japanese external surplus by $20 billion.

The models are not uniform in their estimates, but they all agree in
finding some asymmetry in the current balance effects of Japanese and U.S.

fiscal policies, even after account is taken of the differing sizes and trade
patterns of the two countries. The main reason for this lies in the greater
crowding out apparent in the U.S. models, and the greater extent to which the
crowding out of domestic GNP effects is in favour

of

imported goods and

services. This asymmetry grows with time, so that the third-year results
reported above for U.S. fiscal contraction would show less improvement in the
U.S. balance of payments if reported for the second year, and more if reported

for the fourth and subsequent years. The implication of this for policy is that
while there may be substantial linkages from fiscal policies to current
balances, they accumulate with time, and cannot be expected to have dramatic
effects in the short term. Viewed from the perspective of the early 1980s, the

inference is that the differential fiscal stances of the United States and the
rest of the OECD might have been anticipated to lead eventually to the current

account results of the late 1980s.

Finally, what about the role

of

exchange rates in the fiscal transmission

process? This was the subject of section 4, where it was shown that exchange

25

rates do tend

to move during the adjustment process,

generally so as to

appreciate the currency of the fiscally expanding country. However, these
exchange rate movements do not contribute

a

very large part

of the

power of the

expenditure switching process. In particular, the comparisons between the
partial and the full-model results of exchange rate changes show that

macroeconomic repercussions, which tend to reduce absorption and inflation in
the appreciating countries and to increase them in the depreciating countries,
act to truncate the substantial direct effects of exchange rates on trade
flows.17

paper, Gerry Holtham noted that none of the
three models surveyed for this conference involve model-consistent expectations
of future interest rates and exchange rates, and suggested that consistent
expectations, would be likely to increase the exchange-rate effects of fiscal
policy. This issue has been addressed in a subsequent paper (Helliwell,
Cockerline and Lafrance 1988), which compares the results of adaptive and
model-consistent expectations in a G7 version of MULTIMOD (Masson et al. 1988
describes the IMF's G3 model on which the G7 version is based.) Over the first
three years of U.S. fiscal expansion, the consistent expectations version does
show about four times as much dollar appreciation, on average, as the adaptive
expectations version, but the current account effects are only about 15%
greater, for the reasons discussed in the text.
