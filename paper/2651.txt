PARETO INEFFICIENCY OF MARKET ECONOMIES:

SEARCH AND EFFICIENCYWAGE MODELS

ABSTRACT
This paper shows that market economies with search and in which wages
are affected by efficiency wage considerations

are not constrained Pareto

Wages are not set at Pareto efficient levels, nor is the level

of employment (unemployment) Pareto efficient.

We identify the nature of the

biases and the welfare improving government interventions.
