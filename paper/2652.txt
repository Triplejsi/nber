STRUCTURAL/FRICTIONAL AND DEMAND-DEFICIENT

ABSTRACT

This paper uses data on unemployment rates and job vacancy rates to
measure structural/frictional and demand-deficient components of unemployment
rate differences

across local labor markets.

Data on occupational and indus-

Introduction
Economists frequently categorize unemployment into frictionaL,

structural and demand-deficient components.

refers to the normal movement of individuals into and out of jobs while

These firms (about 5200 in 1980

and 3400 in 1982) are located in 28 local areas which were sites for the EOPP

This relationship was

first examined empirically by Dow and Dicka—Miraaux (1958) for Britain, and
theoretical formulations were developed by Molt and David (1966), Molt (1970)

The standard theoretical treatment of this relatiooahip specifies a
