Introduction

paper analyzes the problem of exchange-rate management from

the perspective of tax policy.

In general, monetary and fiscal policies

are intimately related to each other through the budget constraint of
the government. This interdependence implies that changes in the money
supply

arising from exchange—rate management necessitate corresponding

compensating changes in monetary or tax policies designed to ensure
public—sector solvency.

In a frictionless undistorted model of the

world economy, the specific combination of these monetary and tax poli—

des

is immaterial.

In such a framework, the time distribution of lump—

sum taxes and of monetary changes does not alter the real equilibrium.
Such a model is characterized by Ricardian neutrality and the real
equilibrium is neutral with respect to the nominal exchange—rate
regime. 1/
In this paper, we modify the frictionless model by introducing key>
features that break the strong neutrality results. We consider a framework within which exchange—rate management exerts significant effects on
the economic system.

This framework is then used to demonstrate the

equivalence of various policies of exchange—rate management and corresponding tax policies.

It is for this reason that we view exchange—rate

management as part of the broader issue of fiscal management.
To highlight the salient issues we consider two specific categories
of exchange-rate policies.

The first is a dual exchange regime, which

separates exchange rates for commercial and for financial transactions.

1/ For an analysis of such a model see Helpman and Razin (1979)
Helpman (1981) and Lucas (1982).

—2The second is a unified exchange—rate system in which a country unilaterally pegs its exchange rate at the same rate for all transactions.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
we present the analytical framework.

In Section II,

Section III analyzes the dual

exchange rate regime from the perspective of distortionary taxes, while
Section IV discusses the impact of the dual exchange rates on the world
rate of interest.

The analysis in the next two sections is concerned

with the connection between the fixed (but unified) exchange rate system
and lump sum taxes (Section V), and the effect of this regime on world
interest rates (Section VI).

presented in Sec-

tion VII.

The Analytical Framework

In this section, we consider a minimal framework which nonetheless
captures the main features necessary for the incorporation of monetary
considerations. We assume a model in which domestic and foreign goods
are Internationally tradable and are perfect substitutes in consumption.
For convenience we adopt the cash—in-advance formulation. 1/

Accord—

ingly, purchases of goods require cash payments which are assumed to be
carried out in terms of the seller's currency.

Thus,

goods produced

abroad are purchased with foreign currency, and domestically produced
goods are purchased with domestic currency.

For examples of such a formulation, see Lucas (1980), Stockman
Helpinan (1981), Greenwood (1983), and Persson (l981).

The counterpart of these purchases are the sales of

late domestic currency and foreign firms accumulate foreign currency.
At the end of each period (which coincides with the beginning of the
subsequent period) domestic firms redistribute the proceeds of their
sales to domestic individuals in the form of wages and dividends.
Analogously, at the end of each period foreign firms also redistribute
their proceeds to foreign individuals in the form of wages and dividends.
It is convenient to start with a specification of the policy

undertaken in managing the dual (two-tier) exchange-rate
regime. 1/ In this context government transactions can be separated

As isevident, divergencies

between the domestic and the foreign real rates of interest stem from
the terms involving exchange—rate changes in the dual exchange-rate
regime.

It is important to note that these divergencies arise only from

differences in the percentage rates of depreciations of the commercial
and financial exchange rates.

In the absence of such differences, the

domestic and foreign real rates of interest are equalized.
The present-value factors multiplying the levels of output on the

Prior to this discussion, it is relevant to remark

that the pricing coefficients of output,

the pricing coefficients of consumption shown in equation (6).

In

equilibrium, the lagged payments reflecting the cash-in—advance convention have no effect on the pricing of outputs.
In interpreting the salient features of the equilibirum wealth
given in equation (7), it is useful to consider a benchmark case in
which the authorities do not intervene at all in the foreign exchange
market and allow for free international mobility of capital.

In general, the evolution (rather than the level) of the dual

distorting the prices governing the intertemporal allocation of consumption (and of output if investment is allowed for) and by influencing
wealth.

The distortionary effect on the Intertemporal prices arises

from the wedge that the dual exchange-rate system introduces between the

Adjusting this depreciation for the rise in domestic

prices (indicated by e1/e0) yields the subsidy in real terms.

Accord-

ingly, the expression in equation (10) can be viewed as the discounted
sum of the products of the periodic subsidy rates and the periodic
subsidy bases.
The two effects of the dual exchange—rate system (the intertem—
poral—price effect and the wealth effect) are equivalent to those arising from the imposition of distortionary taxes on international borrowing.

Since in our formulation the exchange rate applicable to debt

service is the financial rate, this dual exchange—rate system is
lent to a system of taxes on international borrowing in which debt
service Is not exempt from the tax.

Alternatively, a dual exchange—rate

system, in which the exchange rate applicable to the debt service is the
commercial rate, is equivalent to the system of taxes on international
borrowing in which debt service is exempt from the tax.

Effects

of Dual Exchange—Rate Policies on the
World Rate of Interest

We develop now a simple diagrammatic exposition that is useful for
the analysis of the International effects of a dual exchange in a two—
country model of the world economy.

The diagrammatic aparatus is

developed in detail in Frenkel and Razin (1987, 1988).

The key channel

through which the effects of the dual exchange-rate policies are transmitted internationally is via changes in the world rate of interest.

outlined

in Frenkel

and Razin

(1986b).

To

apply this procedure of aggregating quantities pertaining to all future
periods into a composite single quantity we need to compute the present
values of various flows.

Assuming that output and the dual exchange—

rate premium do not vary across future periods (t=l,2,...), we define a
constancy equivalent (average) interest rate r and the corresponding
market discount factor R =

l+r.

For ease of exposition, we also

The analysis is conducted with the aid of Figure 1, in which the

The assumption that the utility functions are homothetic enables us to

Exchange Rate Management as Lump-Sum Taxes

In this section we depart from

the

bench—mark case of equation (8)

and examine the pure wealth effects of exchange—rate management.

There-

by we determine the circumstances under which exchange—rate policies can
be shown to be equivalent to lump—sum tax policies.

In order to focus

on the pure wealth effect associated with exchange—rate management, we
introduce again the finite horizon by assuming that the value of I is
less than unity, and we assume that the authorities peg the exchange
rate without separating between the commercial and the financial rates.
In such a unified exchange rate regime, the management of the rate is
nondistortionary, and its impact on the real economic system operates
only through the pure wealth effect (see Helpman and Razln (1987) for a
similar framework).
Using the assumptions that the exchange—rate regime is unified

and that the fixed foreign price

(i.e., et =

P

is norialized to

unity, we express the consumption—opportunity set of equation (7) as:

(16)

Jo

dtCt

where we have used the definitions of

dt

(I/R)t.

The only element that distinguishes between the consumption—oppor—
tunity set shown in equation (16) and the set obtained in the barter
economy (embodied in the expression for wealth in equation (8)) is the
second term on the right—hand side of equation (16).

It follows that in

—

contrast

18 —

with the consequences of dual exchange rates, the unified rate

results in undistorted intertemporal prices.

For example, as shown on

the left-hand side of equation (16), the relative price of consumption
in period 1 in terms of consumption in period 0 is the world real discount factor,

hR.

In our pure monetary model without government spending, the term
(1 —

Y)Eto dtB

is governed by the movement of international reserves

induced by the pegging of the exchange rate.

Accordingly, unless the

government designs its tax and monetary policy so as to always meet (at
the given peg) changes in the demand for money, the pegging operations
are reflected in the evolution of government debt.
As is evident, changes in the stock of government debt influence
the real equilibrium by altering the value of wealth.

The extent to

which government debt influences private—sector wealth depends on the
difference between private and social rates of discount. This difference reflects the finiteness of the individual's expected horizon and it
is the same mechanism responsible for the real effects of lump—sum taxes
analyzed in Frenkel and Razin (l986a). Thus, the effects of unified
exchange—rate management are equivalent to those exerted by lump—sum tax
cum

transfer policies.

Effects of a Unified Pegged Exchange Rate
on the World Rate of Interest

World equilibrium requires that in each period the given supply of
world output equals the demand.

To facilitate the exposition, we again

divide the horizon into two periods:

the present, which is denoted by

t=0 and the future which consolidates all periods from

Equations (18) and (19) specify the initial equilibrium values of
domestic and foreign wealth owned by the existing population.

In this

specification, private wealth is expressed as the sum of the present
values of current and future disposable incomes plus the net asset
positions.

In these equations, the term I/(R — 1) denotes the present

value of an annuity (commencing at period t=l) evaluated by using the
effective constancy—equivalent interest rate.

A unique feature of

equation (18) is the inclusion in it of the term Bg.

This term, which

equals the amount of short-term government debt (reserve losses) associated with the exchange—rate management, reflects the capital gains (due
to overvalued currency) captured by the currently alive domestic private
sector (see Helpman and Raziri (1986)). These equations also embody the
requirement that the home country's initial external indebtedness,
equals the foreign country's initial net creditor position.
Equation (20) is the requirement that world demand for goods in
period t = 0 equal world supply.

The left—hand side of this equation

shows the sum of domestic and foreign per—capita private sector's consumption (as implied by equation (17) and its foreign counterpart), and
the right—hand side is the sum of per—capita domestic and foreign outputs

and

net of government spending.

The equality between

—

I and I* ensures that the sizes of the population of the two countries
are equal to each other.

As a result, aggregate world demand and supply

can be expressed in terms of an equality between the unweighted sum of
the individual country per—capita demand and the unweighted sum of the
corresponding per—capita supply.
sum of
Equation (21) specifies the requirement that the discounted
per-capita domestic and foreign private demand for future goods equal
the discounted sum of per—capita future world outputs net of government
spending.

These discounted sums are cnputed as of period t=0 with the

aid of the constancy equivalent (average) interest rate.

To

verify that this is indeed the meaning of the second term, we note
the disposable income of each individual at the time of birth

and its product with R/(R—1) is the present value of such an annuity.
Therefore, the term ER/(R—1)](Y—T)

denotes each individual's wealth at

the time of birth, and since by our normalization the size of each
cohort at birth is one individual, this term also represents the
cohort's wealth at birth.

Since in each period in the future there is a

new cohort whose wealth at birth is computed similarly, the discounted
sum of all future cohorts' wealth (as of period

value of an annuity (commencing at t=l) evaluated by using the

risk free interest rate.

The resulting expression is then discounted to

the present (period t=0) through a division by R.

This yields

[R/(R_l)(R—1)](Y--T). Multiplying this term by (1—1) converts this
aggregate wealth into the corresponding per—capita wealth.

A similar

interpretation applies to the second bracketed term on the left—hand
side of equation (20).

Finally, the right—hand side of equation (20) is

the discounted sum of all future domestic and foreign outputs net of
governments' spending.

As a manifestation of Wairas' law, the system

is linearly dependent.

In addition to equations (17) through (20), the equilibrium conditions also include the requirements that both governments be solvent.

government solvency, the domestic government constraint is:

Equation (22) is the reduced—form market—clearing condition for
present goods with the left-hand side showing the sum of domestic and
foreign private sectors' demands and the right—hand side showing the
world supply of outputs net of government spending.

Equation (23) is

the reduced—form market-clearing condition for future goods with
analogous interpretations applied to the terms on its left and righthand sides.

These market-clearing conditions are used later in the

diagrammatic exposition of the world equilibrium.
Throughout we assume that the foreign government follows a
balanced—budget policy and that initially the domestic budget is
balanced. This ensures that changes in world rates of interest that
result from domestic policies do not impact on the solvency of the
foreign government and therefore do not necessitate secondary changes in
fiscal policies.

of the system.
