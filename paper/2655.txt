I stress that bringing debt service forward in time has

an additional welfare cost when, as is common, the domestic interest rates
exceed the interest rates on foreign debt.

Moreover,

with pre-existing

domestic government debt, early repayment of foreign debt further deteriorates
the public sector budget (and welfare) by pushing domestic real interest rates
up.

Section V discusses the role that trade policy, and in particular tariffs

and export subsidies, can play in alleviating the welfare loss.

4. To see this, suppose that non-tradables make up 70 percent of the economy.
Assume, contrary to the case envisaged here, that non-tradables are not a net
source of revenue for the government.
Then, to generate a primary surplus of
five percent (of GOP), the government would have to impose a "net" tax rate of
at least 16.7 percent (O.O5/[l-O.7]) on tradables.
Of course, in countries
where government revenues derive to a large extent from exports of natural
resources, the presumption would be that the effect of real depreciations go
the other way.

Of course, the overall budget identity requires that the government have a
deficit in traded goods if it has s surplus in non-traded goods. But when the
relevant budgetary concept is the primary budget (revenues and expenditures
excluding debt service), the government can, and typically will, have a
simultaneous surplus in both traded and non-traded goods.

When such resource mobilization proves impossible, the internal transfer
becomes the binding constraint on debt service.

The question is: how does the

economy then adjust to equate the ex-post surplus of the private sector with

With a slight re-interpretationof our model, we can in fact obtain a
more informative result.

Let us think of good one as a specific exportable,

rather than all exportables.

a tradable composite of other exportables and of the importables.

we can investigate the consequences of a small

Concluding

Remarks

The conventional advice to a country having to generate a resource

transfer abroad is to depreciate the home currency in real terms.

It is

frequently neglected that such depreciations tend to have serious consequences
for the fiscal balance.

As long as non-tradables
