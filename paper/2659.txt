Tax Induced Trading: The Effect of the
1986 Tax ReforR Act on Stock Market Activity

The most sweeping revision of the United States tax code in
many years became law in September, 1986.

One key aspect of

that law was the elimination of the favorable tax treatment of
long term capital gains.

Under prior law, capital gains on as-

sets held at least six months were generally- taxed at only 40
percent of the rate applied to ordinary income.

Under the new

tax law, assets sold after December 31, 1986 are to be taxed,

with

a few exceptions2, at the same rate at which ordinary in-

come is taxed.

This change represented the largest capital

gains tax rate increase in at least half a century.

The purpose of this study

is to assess the short run in-

vestor reaction to this change in the tax treatment of capital
gains.

The nearly 4-month lag between the passage of the legis-

lation and the effective date of the tax rate change gave investors ample opportunity to assess the law's consequences for
their portfolios and adjust their behavior accordingly.

Since

investors are seeking to maximize the risk-adjusted after-tax
return on their portfolio, this record increase in capital gains
tax rates is likely to induce signficant changes in investment
strategy.
This paper differs from earlier work on this subject in
three important respects.

First, earlier studies focussed on

investor behavior during periods of relatively stable capital
gains tax rates.

In contrast, this paper looks at the effects

2

of a sharp discontinuity in the capital gains tax rate.

Second,

because of the stability of the capital gains tax rate, these
earlier studies focussed on

a

recurring distortion of normal in-

vestor behavior induced by a combination of the tax rate and the
end of the tax year.

This paper examines two effects: one

recurring, which we deem the "permanent" effect, and one which
is unique to investor behavior in late 1986, which we deem the

"transitory" effect.

Finally, earlier studies made no distinc-

tion between stocks which had appreciated relatively recently
and stocks which had appreciated over a long period of time.
Given the period studied, no distinction was necessary.

How-

ever, the tax changes in 1986 had a different effect on stocks
whose appreciation (or depreciation) had been recent than on
those stocks whose price change was primarily a long term
phenomenon.

Related Studies

The sensitivity of capital gains realizations to the capital gains tax rate by holders of common stock has been frequently demonstrated.

Feldstein and Yitzhaki

found the sale and

rate.

high income taxpayers reduced the ratio of their long term gains
to dividends by 0.497 for every one percentage point increase in
the capital gains tax rate.

Ninarik [9] reestimated this data

using a different functional form and weighted least squares,
and found a significant, though substantially lower degree of
responsiveness. On the other hand, a report by the Department
of Treasury [14] found the overall responsiveness of capital
gains realizations to be nearly as great as that found by Feldstein, Slenrod, and Yitzhaki.

The Treasury report also found

that conunon stock was the most elastic with respect to the tax
rate of all of the types of assets considered.
Unlike the present paper, these studies examined only the
long term responsiveness of taxpayers to tax changes.

Cross

section data was used which, in theory, represents taxpayer behavior after adjustment to a given tax regime.
felter

[1]

Auten and Clot-

and Lindsey [8] disaggregated taxpayer response into

permanent and transitory components.

However, both studies

looked at aggregate capital gains realizations and did not
report transitory behavior specifically for common stock.
Similarly, the Department of Treasury study considered

4

transitory behavior for aggregate realizations, but not for com-

mon stock sales.
Our consideration of short tern investor response

to capi-

tal gains tax changes uses an analytic technique developed to
study the year—end tax loss selling phenomenon.

Since capital

gains are not taxed until the asset is sold, investors have an
incentive to realize capital losses before the end of a tax year
and hold capital gains until the next tax year.

In a regime of

constant capital gains tax rates, the savings from such a
strategy approximately equals the accrued interest for one year
on the resulting tax consequences.

This suggests that,

in any

period of roughly unchanged capital gains taxes, the volume of
trading in stocks that had appreciated in value over the year
(winners)

should recede to an abnormally low level during Decem-

ber as investors postpone realizations.

Conversely, stocks that

experienced declining value (losers) should experience abnormally high trading volume as year end approaches

and investors seek

to realize those losses in the current year.

Furthermore, the

degree of abnormal volume should depend on the amplitude of
gains and losses.
Dyl

[3)

used a random sample of 100 common stocks for the

period 1948 to 1970.

A relative volume measure was developed

based on monthly trading in the particular stock to total
monthly trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

An expected

volume for December was computed for each stock based on the
relative volume of that security and actual volume on the NYSE.

Constanides

(2]

argued that the optimal trading strategy

for an investor was to sell any short term loser and reinvest
the proceeds in order to reestablish a short term position in

the stock.4

The reason for this is that both short term losers

and short term winners

face a tax rate roughly twice that on

securities held long term, thus doubling the tax saving from a
stock sale which realizes a short term position.

In general this point has been neglected in sub-

However, we expand on Constanides argument

regarding the optimal realization of short term losses by applying it to the unique situation which existed in 1986.

relatively constant capital gains tax regimes.

A decision by

an investor to sell an existing asset and buy an

alternative asset requires the condition given by equation

1.

(1)

The total after tax return for holding the current asset on
is expressed on the left, and the total after tax return for

switching assets on the right.

The key advantage to holding the

existing asset is that no tax is paid currently.

The entire ac-

cumulated value in the investor's current position is allowed to
grow at rate R1.

When the asset is finally sold, the entire

return, (l+R0) (l+R1)—l, is taxed at rate c0.

(The c0 term on

the left side of equation 1 is to compensate for taxing the
whole value of the asset, including the initial purchase price
of unity, in the rest of the left hand term.)

On the other

hand, selling and switching assets involves a current tax
liability equal to c0R0, which diminishes the value of the
stockholder's position to be invested in the new asset. The
rate of return on the new asset, R2, must therefore exceed the
future rate of return on the existing asset to make a sale
profitable.

This extra return is expressed in equation 2.

This effect is permanent,

For expository purposes, we will term this

the permanent lock—in effect.
In December, 1986, the investment calculus

was complicated

by the forthcoming increase in the capital gains tax rate.

If

the investor held the current asset, he would be subject to capital gains tax at the higher rate not only on his future return,
but on the return already accumulated in the asset as well.

On

the other hand, sale of the asset would allow taxation of the
existing return at a lower rate.

sented in equation 1.

(l+(1—c0)R0)

(1+(l—c1)R2)

(3)

The key difference between the investor's choice in equation 1 and the choice given by equation

3 is

that the total

return on the existing asset will be taxed at c1 if the asset is
held.

On the other hand, the existing return, R0, is taxed at

the lower rate of CO if the asset is sold now and the proceeds
reinvested.

Note that the permanent lock—in effect still

remains as the investor is left with a smaller portfoliovalue
if he sells and pays the capital gains tax.

However, the ad-

10

vantage of selling before the capital gains tax rises creates a
separate effect which runs in the opposite direction.

This is

clearly indicated by equation 4.

This is

the
savings (in terms of expected future return) by realizing
existing gains on the asset at the old law's lower tax rate.
Since c1 > c0, if R0 is positive, indicating that a gain has accumulated in the asset, then a positive incentive to sell is
created.

This positive incentive to sell helps to lower the

value of R2 needed to make selling more profitable than holding
the existing asset. The actual decision to sell will depend on

the relative values of the permanent lock-in effect and the
transitory incentive to sell before the rate increases.

As a sidelight, the taxpayer might choose

to sell and then

11

buy back his existing assets.

In this case,

the taxpayer may

expect that his current asset yields as high a return as any
alternative asset, R1 = R2, but may still choose to sell because
his existing return on the asset will be taxed at a substanital—
ly lower tax rate.

Equation 5 illustrates the condition under

which this may be true.

Thus,

tax motivated trading in December, 1986 should exhib-

it a different pattern than tax motivated selling in earlier

years. In the case of winners, there is an increased incentive
to sell them to realize the existing gain on the asset at the

low 1986 capital gains tax

rate.

However, as equation 4

demonstrates, it is by no means clear that this will produce a
net incentive to sell in December, only a reduced incentive to
hold.

This yields our first hypothesis:

Hypothesis #1; In December, 1986, there will be less abnormally

low volume for

winners

than in other Decembers.

How-

it is unclear whether the resulting increase in volume

ever,

will be sufficient to establish abnormally high volume for long
term

winners.
Conversely, the tax treatment of stocks which have declined

over a long period of time should exhibit less abnormally high
volume

in December, 1986.

This can be seen by contrasting equa—

12

tions

and

under the assumption that R0 is negative.

Under

old law (equation 2), there is a clear cut incentive to sell a
loser even if the expected return on the new asset, R2 is less
than that on the existing asset, R1.5
Under the new tax law, this permanent incentive to sell becomes even greater because the tax rate on long term losses un-

der the new

law, c1, is greater than under the

old

law.

We would also expect that there would be less

in tax rates is less.

Hypothesis #2:

Decembers.

However, it is uncertain whether the reduction in

volume will be sufficient to establish abnormally low volume for
long term losers.

The situation for short term capital gains is quite different.

The old tax law only afforded lower capital gains tax

13

rates to assets held at least six months.

The tax rate on short

term capital gains was generally the same as the tax rate on or—
dinary income.

So, in the case of short term winners, there

used to be two reasons not to sell during December.

The first

was the advantage to holding indicated by the permanent lock-in
effect and the resulting deferral of taxes.

The second reason

was that the short term asset would soon become a long term asset, thus halving the effective tax rate.

In the context of

equation 2, the likelihood that a profitable switch sale can be
made is greatly enhanced if the capital gains tax rate, c0, is
halved.

The converse was true

for short term losers.

short term asset produced the greatest tax saving.

Selling a
Holding the

asset entailed two costs: deferral of the tax benefits from
selling a loser and the possible deferral of the asset until it
became a long term loss with a tax value only half that of a
short term loss.
Thus, the incentive to sell short term losses and hold
short term winners was even stronger than the case for stocks
held long term.

Analysis of abnormal volume based on short run

price performance would therefore indicate an even stronger tax
effect than would be indicated by longer term considerations.
Short term performance would only reinforce any tax motivations
which investors possessed for stocks with similar longer term
performance.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 created ambiguity in this situation for trading during December, 1986.

Two

offsetting

effects

14

resulted from the tax changes.

First,

the tax rate on short

term capital gains was scheduled to be reduced beginning on January 1, 1987.

This would increase the incentives to hold stocks

which had appreciated and to sell stocks which had declined over
the short term.

Second, the distinction between the short term

and the long term capital gains tax rates was eliminated.

This

would remove one of the motives for holding winners and selling
losers which existed in prior years.
Although it is uncertain, a priori, which of these effects
is stronger, an analysis of effective

tax rates indicates that

the second effect may dominate the first.

Average marginal tax

rates for 1986 and 1987 were generated using the National Bureau
of Economic Research TAXSIM model.6

Limiting the analysis to

taxpayers who reported receiving dividend income, the average
marginal tax rate on short term gains was 21.0 percent, and fell
to 19.2 percent in 1987.

Thus, the incentive to sell losers and

hold winners in order to take advantage of a change in the short
term capital gains rate is relatively small.

By contrast, the

incentive to hold winners and sell losers before they were converted from short term assets into long term assets was considerably weakened.

The long term capital gains tax rate for these

dividend recipients averaged only 9.4 percent under the old tax
law, but would rise

to

19.2 percent under the new

tax

law.

Thus, the incentive to hold a winner in anticipation of converting a short term gain into a long term gain was reduced from
11.6 percentage points to 2.8 percentage points.
On average, therefore, investors saw little increase in one

15

motivation for holding a winner, and a considerable decrease in
another incentive for holding a winner.

We would therefore ex-

term winpect a decrease in the normal pattern of holding short
ners while selling short term losers. Thus, the clear pattern of
term losers should

a third hypothesis.

Hvtothesis #3;

The pattern of holding short term winners, and

selling short term losers at year end prior to 1986 should be
significantly weakened in 1986.

III. Methodolocv and Data

Tests of these hypotheses require measurement of the
return, or gain, on various stocks for both a long term and a
short term holding period, as well as the trading volume for
these stocks during that holding period.

Our objective is to

group stocks into various portfolios by ranking their return,
and then comparing the year end activity of the various portfolios to see if our hypotheses are supported.

The resulting sample of firms varies from a high of 1578 in 1986

to

a low of 1272 in 1980.

Table I provides additional descrip-

tive data for the sample.

The central concern of this study

is to determine the

transitory effects of the change in capital gains tax laws that
occurred in 1986.

To facilitate this analysis, abnormal volume

data for December during the years 1980 through 1985, a period
of relatively stable tax law, are pooled.

This provides a large

sample of December trading behavior to which December of 1986

can be compared.

IV. Results

A.

Long—Term Performance and Trading Volume

The relationship between long-term capital gains and abnormal trading volume is summarized in Tables II and III.

Mean

abnormal volume data for the pooled data (1980 to 1985) and for
1986 are presented for each long—term capital gain quintile.

To

control for differences in the distribution of capital gains
performance measures (LTR and STh) between the pooled sample and
the 1986 sample1 the LTR (and later, STR) guintile ranges for
the 1986 sample were used to classify the pooled data into 5
groups.

Because the pooled data were matched to 1986 return

levels, the 5 groups contain unequal numbers of firms. For ex—
positional ease they are referred to as quintiles in the ensuing
discussion.

Below each entry

in

Table II, the T-value and the

19

number of firms in the quintile are displayed.

This T-value as-

sesses the hypothesis that the AVOL mean for the quintile is
significantly different from zero.
First,

consider the pooled data in isolation.

The pattern

of means for the pooled data confirms the conventional, pre—1986
strategy of selling losers, creating positive abnormal trading
volume and holding winners, creating negative abnormal trading
volume.

The means are ordered monotonically in the expected

direction.

This confirms earlier findings of various authors

regarding tax effects and year—end selling decisions.
The 1986 data, considered in isolation, illustrate a
similar monotonic pattern, albeit with a minor "flattening" in
the series between quintiles 3 and

4.

However, all 1986

quintile means are positive, suggesting that December trading
volume was abnormally high across our entire sample of stocks.
This indicates that the transitory effect to realize capital
gains before the tax rate increased overwhelmed the permanent
lock—in effect.

evidenced by the F-values, this increase in mean abnormal trading volume is significant at the 5% level for quintile 3, and at

the

1% level for firms exhibiting even better performance in

quintiles 4 and

5.

The pattern of differences provides strong evidence that
investors did indeed sell their long—term winners to lock in a
favorable tax liability at the lower long—term rate rather than
postpone this liability into an epoch of significantly higher

tax

rates.

The hypothesized incentive to hold long—term losers into
1987 in order to enhance the value of such losses is not evidenced by our results, however.

Thus, many capital losses realized in 1986 might actually produce tax savings valued at 1987 tax rates.

This would tend to

maintain the tax motivations for selling losers in 1986.

As

this carry forward provision is not symmetric with respect to
winners, there is a clear reason why our "winner" hypothesis
should exhibit the expected pattern while the "loser" hypothesis
does not.
Quintile medians are reported in Table III.

It is worth

noting that quintile 1 is completly populated by long-term
losers,

Quintile 2 contains a mix of winners and

losers with the mean and median LTR values positive for pooled
and 1986 data.

Thus,

quintile medians indicate that investors

were net sellers of losers and net holders of winners for the
pre—1986 period and in 1986 with the exception of quintile 4.
The trend across medians progresses monotonically for the
pooled data.

This reiterates investors' propensity to sell

losers and to hold winners prior to 1986.

In 1986, the trend is

If anything, the pattern of abnormal trading

volume medians for 1986 quintiles is relatively flat, ranging
from .0496 for the lowest capital gain quintile to —.0375 for
the highest capital gain quintile.
Differences in abnormal trading volume quintiles are also
reported in Table III.

In this instance, quintile 1 exhibits a

shift in its median that is in accordance with our expectation
that investors will hold long-term losers more tightly than in
previous years.

The statistical significance of the shifts

quintile medians is assessed using the Wilcoxon 2-Sample test.8
This nonparametric technique for comparison of two sample
medians provides a test statistic which is normally distributed.
The resulting Z-values are reported in the rightmost column.
This shift appears insignificant for the 40% of firms producing
the poorest capital gains performance during the periods of comparison.

However, median abnormal trading volume increased sig-

nificantly for the remaining 60% of the firms in each sample.

Short Term Effects and Trading Volume

Trading motives concerning the disposition of short—term
gains and losses were also changed by the Tax Reform Act of

taxpayers to hold winners and sell losers were unambiguous,
regardless of whether the assets were held for a long term period or a short term period.

In the case of short term assets,

two objectives entered the investors'calculus, and the effect of
the tax reform depended upon which effect dominated the investor's decision.
In order to examine this hypothesis, we must first control

for the long term motivations created by the tax law.

As a

result, we decompose our data to present short term results
which control for long term portfolio performance.

Since the rankings are done indepen-

dently, the sample size will vary from cell to cell.

To

maintain comparability of data, cell ranges for short term and
long term price changes derived from the 1986 sample are used to
classify the pooled data.

This is done to facilitate comparison

effectively reduces the pooled sample from 8352 to 7909 observations.

The reduction of 443 observations represents STR, LTR

investors had motives to sell such
And they did, as evidenced by

the large abnormal trading volume mean of .4617.

This implies

that trading volume for these firms was 46% higher than expected
during December.
Examining the AVOL means for cells across the uppermost
row, two observations can be made.

First, the number of

qualifying firms dwindles predictably.

Relatively few firms can

claim membership among the top 20% of performers over the last
23 months and the bottom 20% of performers over the last 5
months!

Second, the mean AVOL decreases monotonically as we

move from left to right.

Even among the poorest short—term per-

formers, investors are more likely to hold securities which have

Although not strictly

monotonic, this trend is apparant for each row in the matrix.
Hence, within any group of stocks exhibiting similar short-term
gains,

the propensity to hold (sell) increases as long—term per-

formance improves (deteriorates).
Parallel observations can be made by examining cell entries
within a given column.

If we restrict our attention to the

worst 20% of long term performers (LTR quintile 1), as shortterm performance improves, mean AVOL decreases.

However, this

phenomenon is not repeated for other LTR quintiles.

The STR

marginals display a clear pattern suggesting that investors are

likely to hold short—term winners and sell short—term
losers irregardless of long—term performance. This reinforces

earlier observation that under the old tax law, short term

and long term both should exhibit a pattern of holding winners

and selling

lower panel of Table IV.

This clearly indicates that the identity of in-

vestor incentives arising from short—term security performance
in previous years is no longer present.

Thus, the strongly

monotonic relationship displayed by the STR marginals for the
pooled sample broke down in December of 1986.

For completeness, Table V contains AVOL medians for the 25
cells for pooled data and 1986 data.

This data generally rein-

forces observations made from examination of the cell means in
Table IV.

V. Conclusions

Much of our work reinforces findings by earlier authors
that tax effects were evident in December trading under prior
law.

However, we hypothesized that changes in this pattern were

likely during December 1986 as a result of changes in the tax
law that would take effect as of January

1,

1987.

By and large,

these hypotheses seem to have been substantiated by the data.
First,

it is clear that there was reduced holding of long

However, in 1986, this pattern was

second, contrary to expectations, the opposite

result did not occur for long term losers.

Little change in the

pattern of trading of long term losers was indicated.

Finally,

the usual reinforcing pattern of short term and long term effects was eliminated in December 1986.

The evidence incidates

that the usual patterns evidenced by portfolios paritioned by
both short and long term gains disappeared in 1986.

Taxpaying investors with substantial capital gains
were often required to pay the Alternative Minimum Tax. This
levied at a rate of 20 percent, was applied to ordinary in-

come as well as capital gains income.

2.

For calendar year

1987, the maximum capital gains tax rate

was set at 28 percent, although some taxpayers faced tax rates on
ordinary income as high as 38.5 percent.

Beginning in 1988, the

distinction between these caps was removed.

3.

This 11 month holding period represents a measure of short

term capital gains.

During the period under study in Dyl [3], a

for
holding period of at least 12 months was required to qualify
the favorable long term capital gains tax rate.

4.

While this strategy is technically an illegal "wash" sale

for the purposes of tax avoidance, investors could select
securities which are close substitutes or wait 30 days to
reestablish their positions.

5.

Of course,

if

the investor feels this

way, he can sell and

then repurchase the same security 30 days later.

The economists responsible for creating TAXSIM include

Daniel Feenberg, Martin Feldstein, Lawrence Lindsey, and Andrew
Mitrusi.

We also computed capital gains measures for holding periods

of 11 and 17 months.

One problem with the 11 month measure was

that it was classified as short term during part of our period of
analysis and long term in the remainder. Results derived from

the

17 month measure are consistent with those derived using the

23 month (LTR) measure.
