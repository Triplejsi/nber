EXTERNAL DEBT, PLANNING HORIZON AND DISTORTED

CREDIT MARKETS

ANsTCT

The purpose of this paper is to study the role of policies in the presence of country
risk with overdiscountirig by the policy maker. Overdiscounting may reflect political

uncertainty, which makes the effectiveplanning horizon of the centralized government
shorter than that of the private sector. The consequence of overdiscounting is to shift
the supply curve facing the economy leftwards.The role of optimal borrowing policies in
the presence of country risk is to discourage borrowing for consumption purposes,
encourage investment in openness, and discourage investment in activities that reduce
openness. The effect of overdiscountingby the policy maker is to increase the values of
the optimal policy instruments (i.e. to increase the magnitude of the borrowing taxes
and subsidies). Increasing the relative importance of open activities can be viewed as a
way to reduce the harmful consequences of overdiscounting. Overdiscounting may
rationalize various conditionality clauses that will induce the economy to follow the
desired credit market policies.

1. INTRODUCTIONAND SUMMARY
Most developing countries are presently credit rationed in

the international credit

markets. This is reflected in the segmentation of the international and domestic credit
markets. The domestic market is characterized by high real interest rates where
domestic agents find it impossible to raise new external credit. As is well documented in
the literature, this situation is related to substantial borrowing in the seventies followed
by the reversal of the easy borrowing policy in the early eighties. This reversal
corresponds to the growing awareness to the role

deviations from Ricardian Equivalence to the possibility that the private sector operates
with a shorter planning horizon relative to the public sector because of life-time
uncertainty. An important characteristic of country risk is that the opposite

In the presence of overdiscounting these policies will not be implemented
voluntarily by the decision maker, because he is not maximizing the welfare of the
representative consumer. An obvious source of a distortion in the presence of short

institutional structure we cannot affect the default rule. Instead, a proper

2. THE

MODEL

a simple model to evaluate the dependency of investment decisions
and policies on the planning horizon in the presence of country risk. There are three
periods. In the first period agents in the economy make the borrowing decisions. The
borrowed funds are used to finance investment or consumption. To simplify we assume
that, due to relative scarcities of funds, the first period investment is financed by
external borrowing. Repayment is due in the second period. Default in the second period
triggers a penalty that reduces available resources in the second and third periods. The
default decision is made by a centralized policy maker, such as the central bank, who
compares the costs and the benefits of a default -fault will occur if the costs fall short
of the benefits associated with the default. We udy an economy where the central

3. BORROWING FOR CONSUMPTION AND INVESTMENT: THE AGENT PROBLEM

representative agent will choose consumption and investment as to maximize
the expected utility, given by (10). Assuming that each agent is price taker, he views
his borrowing as negligible relative to the aggregate borrowing of the country. Thus, he
treats the probability of default (and consequently c0) as being exogenously given to

equilibrium) is obtained by maximizing (10):

Since we assumed that consumers are risk

neutral and that the rate of time preference
rate is constant, then for a tax rate below consumers will borrow until the credit
constraint is reached, and for a tax rate above p no borrowing for consumption will
occur We will assume an internal equilibrium where the tax p is imposed. At that

to capture the wedge between the external supply price of credit and the domestic
price of credit that is needed to clear the domestic market for credit. For further

We would like to evaluate the role of policies in

the policies that maximize the welfare of the representative consumer may require

Maximizing the welfare of the representative consumer will require a
default rule like (8) with no overdiscounting (i.e., with t = 1). As is elaborated in
12

footnote 8, the decision rule in our paper may reflect uncertainty regarding the
survival of the policy maker and is consistent with the case where the policy maker
maximizes his own expected welfare.

by the terms in large brackets in (15), which measure the wedge between the marginal

Country risk introduces a distortion that raises the social cost of funds. The distortion
arises from the fact that individual borrowers treat the rate of interest as given even
though, from the perspective of the country as a whole, the rate of interest increases
with the volume of consumption borrowing due to the rise in the probability of default.
Each small consumer overlooks the marginal rise in the probability of default induced
by his marginal borrowing. The increase in the probability of default entails a negative
externality because of the consequent rise in the expected default penalty inflicted on
all domestic consumers.

Unlike consumption borrowing, marginal investment borrowing affects the
interest rate in two opposite directions (see Appendix A.3 for the derivation of this

result). Fir5t, marginal borrowing raises total indebtedness, thus increasing the
probability of default. This effect is similar to that observed for consumption borrowing.
Second, the investment also changes the productive capacity of the economy, thereby
17
affecting the default penalty and the probability of default . We refer to these two
effects as the indebtedness and openness effects. The indebtedness effect reflects an
upward move on the given supply of credit facing the economy, whereas the openness
effect reflects the consequences of the investment on the location of the supply of

the elasticity is the sum of both effects (see
(A19)). The optimal borrowing tax balances these two effects. The stronger the openness
effect, the lower the optimal investment borrowing tax (18), and if the openness effect
dominates, the elasticity ij and the corresponding borrowing tax will be negative.
Figure 2 describes opti'mal investment. Curve NVMP depicts the dependencyof the

5. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Throughout the paper we have assumed the presence of a centralized decision
maker, who undertakes the decision regarding the default and who implements policies.
We studied the potential consequencesof overdiscountingby the policy maker. Our key
results are that the consequence of overdiscountingis to shift the supply curve facing
the economy leftwards. In the context of desirable credit market policies,
overdiscounting by the policy maker increases the tax on borrowing for consumption
purposes and for investment in sectors that are not biased towards international trade;
it also increases the subsidy for borrowing for investment in sectors heavily biased
towards international trade. We concludewith an outline for a possible extension of our

analysis and some qualifying remarks.
Our discussion provided a rather narrow interpretation of the optimal policies. We
terpreted the optimal polices in the form of borrowing taxes and subsidies that
generate the proper wedge between the external interest rate facing the economy and
the internal interest rate facing the representative agent. A dual representation of the

investment and for the saving and borrowing decisions
We concluded that in the presence of overdiscounting the optimal
degree of
openness (or trade dependency) exceeds the one
ed by the policy maker. It is
noteworthy that our discussion overlooked several - : ortant factors that are relevant
for a more complete determination of the optimal degree of openness. First, openness
has the consequence of reducing the exposure to domestic shocks, and increasing the
exposure to external shocks. Second, one should recognize that the ability of developing
nations to increase openness is conditional on the willingness of the developed nations to
tolerate it. Both factors may dampen the optimal degree of openness. Our analysis can
be extended to account for these factors by allowing for the presence of domestic and
foreign shocks and by considering

Our analysis should be viewed only as an example intended to highlight a more
general point: country risk and overdiscounting by the policy maker generate an

environment where the optimal openness form the point of view of private agents may
exceed the optimal openne - :orm the point of view of the policy maker, justifying
conditionality attached to new credit. This result should apply also to alternative
models. We considered the case where the costs of default are the result of trade

activities that they choose to engage in. The duality between the two interpretations of

and the equivalent set of taxes cum subsidies on domestic activities (like consumption
and production).

The Default Penalty
In the paper we considered the case where the default penalty 0 is exogenously
given. We start the Appendix by deriving the default penalty endogenously. For
simplicity we give an example of a two-sectorial economy. Our analysis applies also to
an economy with any number of sectors. Output is produced by domestic and imported
inputs. The two sectors differ in terms of their reliance on international trade. A default
results in a rise in the price of imported inputs. The various sectors differ in their
dependency on importable goods. For example, consider an economy where output in
sector 1 (denoted by X1) is producedby the following process:
