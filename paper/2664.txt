EVIDENCE FROM SEVEN COUNTRIES ON WHETHER

SMOOTH AGGREGATE OUTPUT

ABSTRACT

Casual examination of annual postwar

output for

data on inventories and aggregate

seven developed countries--Canada,

Japan, United Kingdom,

France, West Germany,

Italy,

United States- -suggests that in these countries the

primary function of aggregate inventories is not to smooth aggregate output
in the face of aggregate demand shocks.

Japan is a possible exception to

this generalization.

III. Conclusion

Casual examination of annual postwar data suggests that in the "C]" group

of countries aggregate inventories do not serve mainly to smooth output
fluctuations

in the face of aggregate demand shocks.

Japan provides a

possible exception, although even in Japan production smoothing behavior, if
present,

is not particularly marked.

That inventory behavior is qualitatively

similar in these countries is consistent with Moore (1978), whith gives the
level and change in inventories the same position in the NEER reference

cycle

in each of the seven countries.
A simple extension of this work is to consider quarterly data as well, at
least in those countries where the quarterly data are reasonably reliable.

The work of Wilkinson (1986) suggests that quarterly results are likely to be
broadly similar, although it also suggests that at quarterly frequencies
Japanese inventory behavior is not qualitatively different from that of the
other countries.

More generally, desireable areas for future research include

considering the role of inventories in business cycles in light of
international
economies

differences in tax systems, in the degree to which various

are open, and in the sources of business cycle shocks.

Notes:
1. Annual data, 1957-1986.
for Q,
2. Moments for Q, S and H calculated around a constant and time trend,
and MI around a constant. For each, a shift in these deterministic terms
was allowed in 1974.
3. In panels B and C, variances and covariances are on and below the diagonal,
correlations are above the diagonal.

Notes:
1. See notes to Table I.
2. For columns (5) and (6), units are billions of real (1980) units of home
currency, squared.
3. As explained in the text, column (5) essentially calculates var(Q)-var(S)
in a fashion that is robust to the presence of unit roots. Column (6) is
presented solely for comparison to column (5).
