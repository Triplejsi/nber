These conaiderations raise a
fundamental question: What is a

description of such markets?
Namely, how do oligopolistic firma behave
when
faced with segmented markets and what
are the
consequences of this behavior?
This is a broad
question that cannot possibly be answered
in the framework of
a single article. A
complete answer requires treatment of
products with
different characteristics, various
forms of conduct,
entry considerations, and
the like. In this paper we deal
with a limited problem

results.

A detailed motivation and
justification of our formulation is
provided in
the next section. In Section
3 we describe the formal
model.
Then, in
Section 4, we characterize its
solution and discuss economic
implications.
This is followed by the
development of an example in Section 5.
