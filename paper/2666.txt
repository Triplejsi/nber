In anthropology there is a functionalist tradition of long standing
which attempts to explain social institutions (political, economic,
sociological, cultural, and psychological) as functional adaptations to
a society's environment or ecosystem. Functionalist theories differ in
their degree of subtlety and sophistication and in their emphasis, but
none seem to make a sharp distinctionbetween equilibrium and optimum.

One exception is Carmichael [1988]. He considers peer review in the
university setting, which is a form of indirect monitoring system, and
argues that the institution of tenure is needed to make peer review

In our example, the market by itself is constrained Pareto efficient.
However, there is terceived market failure, and the non—market
institution (the provision of supplementary non—market insurance) arises
In response to this perceived market failure.
In an expanded version of our model in which there are many kinds
of accidents and many commodities, the market is not constrained Pareto
there Is genuine potential market failure (Arnott and
efficient;
Stiglitz [1986]). Our result concerning the possible dysfunctionality
of spontaneous non—market institutions carries over to this more
realistic setting.

The conjecture that the resulting equilibria are efficient is often
attributed to Coase [1960]. He seems, however, to have been more concerned with small group externalities than with more generalized

externalities.

In one sense, this result should come as no surprise, since it is by now
well—recognized that, even in large economies, Nash equilibria are
Pareto efficient only under special circumstances. One of the great
achievements of modern economics was to identify a special set of
assumptions under which competitive economies are Pareto efficient.

Akerlof [1980] has argued that inefficient social customs may persist as
Nash equilibria, and that there can be an arbitrarily large set of
social customs sustainable as Nash equilibria.
The point in our paper is related but different. Akerlof considers
the possible persistence of inefficient institutions, but does not investigate how the institutions came into being. We show not only that
an inefficient institution can persist, but also that it can arise
spontaneously.
Furthermore, while in the Akerlof model, there are
multiple equilibria of which some may be efficient, in our model there
is a unique equilibrium.
