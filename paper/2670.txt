INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION OF ECONOMIC POLICIES:
SCOPE, METHODS, AND EFFECTS
ABSTRACT

This paper discusses the scope, methods, the effects of international
coordination of economic policies. In addressing the scope for and of
barriers
coordination, the analysis covers the rationale for coordination,
of
to
be
and
coordinated,
to coordination, the range
specificity
policies
the frequency of coordination, and the size of the coordinating group. Turning
to the methods of coordination, the emphasis is on the broad issues of rules
versus discretion, single-indicator versus multi-indicator

approaches, and

hegemonic versus more symmetric systems.
In an attempt to shed some light on the effects of alternative rulebased proposals for coordination, we present some simulations of a global
macroeconomic model (MULTIMQD) developed in the International Monetary Fund.
The simulations considered range from 'smoothing

rules for monetary and

fiscal policy that imply only minimal international coordination, to more
activist "target—zone" proposals that place greater restrictions on national
authorities in the conduct of monetary and/or fiscal policies.

The simulation

results are compared to the actual evolution of the world economy over the
1974—87 period. Our findings suggest that simple mechanistic rule—based
proposals are unlikely to lead to improved performance.

that economic policy actions, particularly those of

This presumption

is reinforced by two empirical

considerably more open and integrated than that of 1950, or 1960, or
even of 1970.

capital markets more integrated. 9/

With larger spillovers, there is

more at stake in how one manages interdependence. Second, there is by
now widespread recognition that the insulating properties of floating
exchange rates are more modest than was suspected prior to their
introduction in 1973. 10/
But a presumption that cooperation could be beneficial

is not

the

same as a guarantee——nor does it preclude the existence of sometimes
formidable obstacles

to its implementation.

Suppose national policymakars have a predilection for inflationary
policies but are restrained from implementing them by the concern that

relatively expansionary mooetary policy will bring on a devaluation
(or depreciation).

Yet, as outlined by Rogoff (1985), if all countries

pursue such inflationary policies simultaneously, none has to worry
about the threat of devaluation. Here, coordination may actually
weaken discipline by easing the balance of payments constraint.

In a

Equally troublesome would be a

The basic point is straightforward: there is nothing in the

coordination process in and of itself that reduces the importance of
sound macroeconomic policiea.

two issues arise——

one dealing with fiscal policy, and the other with structural policies.

A

strong implication of recent research is that aggregate measures,

such as the central or general—government fiscal deficit, are not
likely to be a good guide to the effects of fiscal policies on macroeconomic variables such as the current account, the exchange rate, and
the rate of interest.

24/

The reason is that such effects depend on

how the deficit is altered: that is, taxes versus expenditures,
ditures on tradables versus nontradables,

taxes

expen-

on investment versus

those on saving, fiscal action by a country with a current account
surplus versus a deficit,

and anticipated versus unanticipated

policies.

This suggests that mote specificity in coordination——quiteapart from
its positive effect on the ability to monitor the implementation of

agreed—on policies——would

be desirsble. It is notable that the Louvre

Accord of February 1987 smong the Group of Seven specified not only
quantitative tsrgets for budget deficits but also some quantitative
guidelines of how these overall fiscal targets wets to be achieved. 25/
In the ares of structural policies,

a good case can also be made

for specificity——buton somewhat different grounds.

Here, coordination

the trade and distribution system.

The simultaneous appli-

cation of the policy measures across countries may be necessary to
overcome the blocking tactics of domestic pressure groups and to enhance
the credibility of the exercise.

Again,

the depth or specificity of

coordination can be as relevant as the range.
Another salient issue

concerns the question of when to coordinate.

There has been, and continues to be, wide variation in the frequency
of coordination across different fora——ranging

from one—of—a—kind

meetings like the 1971 smithsonian Conference on exchange rates to
the near continuous discussion and decision making at the Executive

Boards of the LMF and the World Bank.

Dini (1988) has recently argued that international consider-

Methods of Coordination
This section, shifts the focus from whether to coordinate to

how to coordinate.

More specifically,

the advantages and disadvantages

of alternative methods of coordination are discussed, with particular
attention

to the issues of rules versus discretion,

single versus

multi—indicator approaches, and hegemonic versus symmetric systems.
It is not surprising that many of the issues that emerged

during the long and continuing debate on the relative merits of rules
versus discretion in domestic economic policy should have resurfaced in
the dialogue on international economic policy coordination.
the present system of managed floating,
the Plaza Agreement

After all,

even as it has evolved since

of September 1985, is much closer to a pure discretion

than to a pure rules model.

In this regard,

the gold standard with its

automatic specie flow mechanism, the adjustable peg system with its
clesr implications for the subordination of domestic monetary policy to
the exchange rate (except during fundamental disequilibria),

with its parity grid and divergence indicator,

the

target zone proposals

exchange rate threatens

to breach the zone, and pure floating with its

market——all can be considered less discretionary than the present
exchange rate system.

First,

eliminating any excess demand for coordina-

decreasing the demand (or the need) for coordination. 33/

The

main counter—arguments in favor of a discretionary approach

are the following. First, rule—based adjustment systems often turn out
to be less automatic in practice than in theory. For exorple, the
automaticity of the specie—flow mechanism under the hiatorical gold
standard was often undermined by the proclivity of authorities to

offset or sterilize the effect of gold flows. 36/

policy only to the extent that the penalties

for breaking the

rules are significant enough to ensure that the rules are followed.

In light of all this, there may not be any attractive alternative
to conducting economic policy coordination in a judgmental way.

Even after the choice is made about coordinating via rules or
discretion,

there remains

around a single indicator

the decision of whether to coordinate
or a set of indicators.

A regime of fixed

exchange rates or target zones is an example of the former approach,
while the ongoing Group of Seven coordination exercise is an example
of the latter.
There are two main considerations that are typically advanced
to support the single—indicator spproach.

One is that it avoids

policies by presening for each country freedon
of action over those policies not used to reach the single target
variable. Thus, for example, if the exchange rate is the focus of

carry significant advantages in the battle to restore credibility to

But relying on a single polIcy IndIcator can also carry

substantial risks.

Perhaps

the most serIous one is that the single

indicator can send weak——or even false——signals about the need for
changes

in other policies that are not beIng coordInated. This is

perhaps best illustrated by considering the problem of errant fiscal
policy under a regime of fixed exchange rates or of target zones.
First, consider fixed rates.

With high capital mobility,

a fiscal

expansion will yield an incipient positive interest rate differential,

—

a capital inflow, and an overall balance of payments surplus——not a

deficit. Here, exchange rate fixity helps to finance——and by no means
disciplines——irresponsiblefiscal policy. 42/

Only if and when the

markets expect fiscal deficits to be monetized will they force the
authorities to choose between fiscal policy adjustments and devaluation. 43/

In contrast,

But all is not a bed of roses

here either.

While all effective

approaches to coordination require a consiatency of policy instruments
and targets within and across countries,

this requirement of consistency

or compatibility can take an added prominence when authorities make
public a set of targets and intended courses for policy instruments. 47/
Two aspects merit explicit mention. One ia that exchange rate
targets——or

even concerted views on the existing pattern of exchange

rates——must be consistent with the announced course of monetary and
fiscal policies.

Without that consistency,

attempts to provide the

market with an anchor for medium—term exchange rate expectations

are

likely to prove fruitless.
The second point is that the credibility of multiple policy targets

also hinges on the constraints on policy instruments.

Two such constraints

are the striking inflexibility of fiscal policy in almost all industrial
countries,

48/ and the limited

ability of sterilized exchange market

intervention to affect the level of the exchange rate over the medium—
term (unless of course it provides a signal about the future course of
policies).

49/

A relevant concern is that limitations on other policy

instruments may wind up with monetary policy being asked to carry too

—

heavy

23 —

a burden——with primary responsibility for maintaining internal

and external balance.

In such a case, any contribution that a multi—

indicator approach to coordination could make to enhancing the predictability of pnlicies would also be diminished.

This is so because a

shock to the system——such as the October 1987 global stock market crash———
might raise the question in minds of market participants

of whether

by WIllIamson (1983 and 1985), and extended by WIllIamson and Miller
(1987).

The original proposal calculated

exchange rates,
movements

'fundamental equilIbrium

and advocated the use of monetary policies to resist

away from those rates.

As explaIned by WIlliamson (1983):

'The basic focus of exchange rate management should be on estimatIng
an approprIate value for the exchange rate and seekIng to limit
devIations from that value beyond a reasonable range (p. 47)...
While other techniques, lIke sterilIzed intervention, may be able
to give limIted assIstance, a serious commItment to exchange rate
management leaves no realistic alternative to a willingness to
direct monetary polIcy at least in part toward an exchange rate
target. (p. 56)

More recently, Williamson and Miller (1987, p. 7) supplement the
prescription

that monetary policies be used to target real effective

exchange rates with the assignment of fiscal policies to targets for the
growth in domestic demand for the Group of Seven countries:
"The basic argument is that a nominal income target fulfills the
same function as a money supply rule, providing a "nominal anchor'
to prevent inflation from taking off and a guide to expectatIons,
while avoiding the shocks to demand that come from varIatIons In
velocIty...'

In addition, the proposal, or

blueprInt,' specifies

(p. 2) that:

"the average level of world (real) short—term Interest rates
should be revised up (down) if aggregated growth of nomInal
Income is threatenIng to exceed (fall short of) the sum of
the target growth of nominal demand for the participatIng
countrIes."
Earlier simulation

studies of target zones have been undertaken

by

WillIamson and MIller (1987, Appendix C), based on EdIson and others (1987).
Those studIes employed

the Federal Reserve Board's multicountry model (MCM),

This is apparent for both the more limited sssignment of monetary policy

Also,

the cost of

With perfect foresight,

the amount they must rise in the

Footnotes
1/ This paper was presented st a conference organized by the L'ff
and HWWA—Institut fur Wirtschatsforschung on "National Economic Policies
and Their Impact on the World Economy" held in Hamburg on May 5—7, 1988.
In addition to colleagues in the Research Department, the authors are
indebted to Hali Edison, Martin Feldstein, Pieter Korteweg, and Jacques
Melitz for helpful comments on an earlier draft.

2/ See the surveys by Artia and Ostry (1986), Cooper (1985), Fischer
(1987), Hamada (1979), Home and Masson (1988), Kenen (1987), Polak (1981)
and Wallich (1984).
3/ Evidence on the size of spillover effects from policy actions by
the major industrial countries is discussed in the latter part of this
section and in Table 1 of Section IV.

4/ The conclusion that a monetary expansion under
rates affects
real output in opposite directions at hone and abroad floating
is associated with

Mundell (1971)—Fleming (1962) model. For a recent evaluation of
model, see Frenkel and Razin (l987a); a broader survey of the
International transmission mechanism can be found in Frenkel and Musaa
(1985). Econometric models are more divided on whether a monetary
expansIon under floating rates has negative transmission effects on real
output abroad; see Helliwell and Padmore (1985) and Bryant and others
the

this

(1988).

5/ We regard the label as inappropriate, both because the proponents
of decentralized macroeconomic policy—making——including Corden (1983),
(1986), Feldatein (1987), Niehans (1988), Stein (1987), and Vaubel
(1985)——are geographically quite diverse, and because some prominent
German economists, such as Puehl (1987), have stressed the importance
of coordination.
6/ Corden (1986) has recently argued that there oay be a case fur
asking large countries to slow their speed of adjustment to desired
policy targets so as to dampen movements in real exchange rates that
could cause difficulties for others (see SectIon IV).

L Another constraint on regional attempts to create more of the
public good is that they may divert or discourage its production

As developed in Polak (1988), the need for rules to guard against
the dangers of fine tuning has receded in any case since economic policy
in most industrial countries is now oriented much more toward the medium—

Another recent paper, Taylor (1986), considers different exchange
rate arrangements in a rational expectations model; however, only
completely fixed and freely floating exchange rates are compared, and
the model is limited to the seven major industrial countries.
62/

63/ The model simulations do not, however, allow for two other ways in
which private sector behavior may be affected by changes in policy regimes
First, the variance of output, prices, or exchange rates may be different,

rates has led to a lower level of international trade than would have

fundamentals. For example, the rise of the 1J.S. dollar early in 1985

denominated assets is hard to explain.
64/

See Masson and others (1988).

65/ In contrast to the industrial countries, developing countries are
not assumed to face perfect capital markets, Instead, the availability
of financing reflects their ability to service debt, as measured by a
ratio of their inflation—adjusted interest payments to the value of their
exports. It is assumed that there is an uppor limit to this ratio,
beyond which the risk of nonrepayment becomes high, and consequently
creditors would refuse to grant further new lending. As a result of
the financing constraint, imports by developing countries are also constrained, tending to reduce both consumption and investment. The constraint on financing is, however, not solely based on current developments
but also reflects an assessment of future export prospects of developing
countries; expected future exports are made to be consistent with the
model's solution for those future exports.
66/ This is a feature that will be relaxed in future work——in
particular, by mposng shocks to residuals in successive periods.
67/ Labor markets do not appear explicitly in the model, but features
of wage bargaining, such as those due to overlapping multiperiod contracts
are reflected in the equation estimated for inflation.
68/ One strong implication of this empirical regularity is that any
"assignment rule" that assigns monetary policy to the current account——
for example, Williamson and Miller's (1987) Blueprint——is going to face
problems; on this point, see Genberg and Swoboda (1987) and Boughton

(1988).

70/ Niehans (1988, p. 215) also stresses the importance of steady
policies: The first, and most promising, step to reducing international
disturbances must surely be the avoidance of the policy shifts that
produce them. Especially for the dominant economy, the United States,
the most important part of cooperation is steadiness."
The measure of real effective exchange rate is the country's manufactured export price, divided by a weighted average export price of its
competitors, including developing countries. Thus, an increase indicates
appreciation.

73/ The role of this variable is to give a nominal anchor to the system.
The inclusion of this term is also consistent with the intent of the
blueprint proposal to make the level of interest rates depend (in an
unspecified fashion) on the growth of aggregate UN?.

In implementing the rule, the value given by Edison and others

not solve or gave negative nominal interest rates. Consequently a higher
value, 20 percent, waa used, implying a lower feedback of exchange rate
miaalignmenta on interest rates.

Again, we adopt Williamson's (1985) estimates of target or equilibrium
real effective exchange rates merely to stay as close as possible to the
original proposals. There should be no implication that we agree or
disagree with those estimates.
76/

77/ It should also be noted that MULTIMOO's definition of real effective
exchange rates is wider than moat measures, since it allows for competition
from manufacturea produced in developing countries.
78/ It is also the case in Edaon and others (1987), that real exchange
rates undera target zone regime differ little from their hiatorical
values.
