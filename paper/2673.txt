DEBT NEUTRALITY, PROFESSOR VICKR.EY
AND HENRY GEORGE'S "SINGLE TAX"
ABSTRACT

In

the overlapping generations model with uncertain lifetimes,

efficient life insurance markets and no operative intergenerational gift
and bequest motive, a positive birth rate has been shown to be
sufficient and necessary for absence of debt neutrality:

equilibrium

prices and quantities are independent of the mix of government borrowing
and lump—sum taxation,

holding constant the path of exhaustive public

spending.
Implicit in this analysis has been the assumption that the lump—sum
tax is a tax on the income from human capital.

Postponing lump—sum

taxes then makes it possible to shift (part of) the tax burden to future
generations if the birth rate is positive.
the income from a non—human fixed factor

If instead the tax falls on

(land)

whose ownership claims

are priced efficiently, then, if all land is owned by generations
currently alive, changes in the intertemporal

pattern of taxation do not

permit current generations to shift the tax burden to future
generations.

factors

Taxes on the income from all "fully owned

non—human

have this property, even those factors supplied elastically, but

the latter will of course be subject to the familiar incentive or
allocative effects ofchanges in (non—lump—sue) taxation.
