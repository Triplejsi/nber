An important set of questions in

this area concerns "Schumpeterian" hypotheses of the

influence of competition and firm size on innovation.
Much of the theoretical and empirical work on process

Recent empirical studies yield mixed results, however,

on

the question of whether larger firms are more or less

innovative than are their smaller counterparts (see

1982, Hannan and McDowell, 1984, and Levin, Levin,

This paper uses data on steam-electric generating

analyze patterns of process technology

The existence of de facto exclusive retail
franchises and rate-of-return regulation need not imply
that firms have no incentives to undertake cost-reducing
investments. For investor-owned utilities (bus),
regulatory lag provides strong incentives to invest in
cost saving technologies (Joskow, 1974). Other mechanisms through which investment incentives may operate
include the threat of municipal condemnation (takeovers)
and the possibility of wholesale power transactions with
other utilities. All three of these mechanisms operated
during our sample period and were particularly prominent
during the l95Os and l960s, when most of the generating
units in our sample were planned.
These technologies are discussed in Joskow and
Rose (1985).

This explicit distinction

Our notion of innovativeness is quite similar to
Mansfield's (1968, p. 172) argument that large firms
should be interpreted as being more progressive only if
"the difference in the speed of response between large
and small firms is greater than would be expected if a
large firm acted as if it were simply the sum of an
equivalent number of small, independent firms."
An example may clarify our distinction. Compare two
utilities: a large firm with 1000 megawatts (Mw) of
capacity and a small firm with 100 Mw of capacity, each
growing at 10 percent per year. Assume that both will
use the new technology at the first available opportunity; that is, they are equally "innovative." If new
units come in 100 Mw increments, the large utility will
build a unit next year, while the small utility may not
build a new unit for 10 years. We attribute this gap to
differences in opportunities, not to differences in the
propensity to adopt new technologies.

Our decomposition also can be interpreted as

observing a firm's adoption decision from those that

Sommers uses a logit model to estimate the
choice between coal and nuclear technologies conditional
on building, but he uses only one observation per
utility: the first adoption (for adopters) or last nonadoption (for non-adopters) decision.
Utility characteristics are measured in the year of that decision,
implicitly assuming that characteristics that affect
adoption decisions vary through time but that the time
path of characteristics prior to the adoption decision is
irrelevant. These features make it difficult to compare
his results to those of other studies.

We ignore potential differences in the regulatory environment across IOIJs and focus instead on
differences in ownership structures.
Since municipal and
cooperative utilities are not regulated in the same sense
as are lOUs, any differences between the groups may
reflect both organizational and regulatory effects.
All
investor-owned utilities face essentially the same
general form of regulation. Within this general structure the regulatory environment of course varies over
time and space.
These differences are difficult to
characterize empirically, however, and we do not believe
that variables reflecting such differences are likely to
be correlated with the independent variables that we use.
It may be worthwhile to introduce measures of variations
in the competitive and regulatory environment in future
research. Absent this, our results should be interpreted
as measuring the influence of the observed factors in the
presence of regulated local monopoly markets.

projections and unit retirement schedules, and then
decide what type of units to build to meet their additions schedule.
This assumption may not strictly hold;
if new technologies are scale-augmenting, technology
choice may have some effect on building schedules. Even
in this case, the increase in efficient size is unlikely
to be large relative to the size of the "average"
generating unit. We therefore maintain the independence
assumption as approximately correct, and believe that
accounting for potential correlations is unlikely to

Statistical Models of Technolozy Adoption
The empirical literature has used a variety of

approaches
22

to

estimate models of technology diffusion.

One might expect this to increase the adoption
probability for 2400 technologies, although there is
little evidence of this in the data.

For concreteness, we consider two

specifications of the hazard rate.
The proportional hazards model

is

perhaps the most

widely used specification; in the diffusion literature,
LLM (1987) use this model to estimate the diffusion of
optical scanners among retail grocery stores.

The

proportional hazards model assumes that the relative
hazard rates for two firms are constant through time,
allowing the hazard

to be

decomposed into separate firm

27

and time components.

We can write this as

h(t) —

where h0(t) specifies the evolution of the
hazard rate over time and X.1 are fixed firm characteris-

h0(t)exp(Xj,
tics.

The time component can be estimated non-para-

metrically (see LLM, 1987) or parametrically by assuming
some distribution for h0(t). Our estimates of the
proportional hazard model parameterize h0(t) using the
Weibull distribution:

Conclusions
The results presented in this paper provide strong

evidence that large firms tend to lead the electric
utility industry in adopting technological innovations.
For both of the new technologies we analyze,

increasing size reduces the probability of early adoption.

Our results also suggest that Oster's (1982)

finding of

negative correlation between firm size and

a

innovativeness in the steel industry does not generalize
to all capital-intensive industries.

Our results also suggest that ownership structure
can exert am important influence on immovative activity.
Investor-owned utilities tended

to

adopt the 2400 psi

technology earlier than did their municipally-owned and
cooperatively-owned counterparts in the industry, leading
to

more rapid diffusion of the technology through the

industry.

This finding

is

consistent with the observa-

tion that investor-owned utilities also exhibit more
involvement in industry research and development activities and organizations.

our analysis provides strong evidence on
