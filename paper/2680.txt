PRECAUTIONARY SAVING AND THE TIMING OF TAXES

ABSTRACT

This

paper

analyzes

the

of governeent debt and income taxes on

effects

consumption and saving in a world of infinitely—lived households having
uncertain and heterogeneous incomes.

The special structure of the model

allows exact aggregation across households despite incomplete mmrkets.

The

effects of government debt are shown to be substantial, roughly comparable

to those resulting from finite horizons, and crucially dependent on the length
of time until the debt is repaid.

Also, anticipated changes in taxes are

shown to cause anticipated changes in consumption.

Finally, an index of

fiscal stance is derived.

Introduction
Economists are increasingly aware of the importance of heterogeneity

among individuals for issues in macroeconomics.

One such issue is the

interaction between individual income uncertainty and tax policy.

Since an

individual's personal tax liability is typically contingent on his income, and
since future income is uncertain, future taxes provide a form of insurance.
This insurance effect of income taxes has normative implications regarding the
desirability of the taxes (Varian, 1980) and positive implications regarding
their impact on consumption and saving (Chan,

1983; Barsky, Mankiw, Zeldes,

1986).
The purpose of this paper is to study the response of consumption to the
timing of labor income taxes.

We assume that individuals are infinitely
We also

lived, so that the taxes do not redistribute across generations.
assume that labor supply is inelastic, so that the taxes are not
distortionary.

The failure of Ricardian equivalence in our model is fully

attributable to the insurance effect of the income tax system.

This failure

of Ricardian equivalence, which was discussed by Barro (1974, p. 1115) and
Tobin (1980, p. 59—60), was first analyzed explicitly by Chan using a
two—period model.

Barsky, Mankiw, and Zeldes argued that this insurance

effect is likely to be quantitatively

important; they examined multi-period

examples but only through the use of computer simulations and under the
assumption that income is independently distributed in each period.
allow individual income to follow a Markov process.

Here we

Under the assumption that

the utility function is exponential, we are able to examine analytically the
response of consumption over time to various policy interventions.

—2—

After describing the model and its solution in Section II, we examine in
Section III the impact of changes in the timing of income taxes.

All the

policy interventions satisfy an intertemporal government budget constraint.
If contingent claims markets were complete or if utility were quadratic, one
would obtain the Ricardian result that these interventions have no impact on
consumption.

We assume, however, that individuals face idiosyncratic inccme

risk and that, since tax liabilities are contingent on individual income,
changes in the timing of these liabilities change perceived risk.

This change

in risk interacts with the precautionary motive for saving (Leland, 1968;
Sandmo, 1970; Dreze and Modigliani, 1972).

Am in Barsky, Mankiw, and Zeldes,

the implied behavior appears in some ways more Keynesian than Ricardian.
First, we examine a current tax cut, coupled with a tax increase in the
future to repay the additional debt and accumulated interest.

We show that

the horizon over which the debt is repaid is crucial to the effect of the tax
cut.

Tax reschedulings over short periods of time have little impact on

consumption, while tax reschedulings over long periods of time have
substantial impact.
Second, we consider the empirically plausible case in which a tax cut is
coupled with a permanently higher level of debt.
rates are raised just enough to service the debt.
Ricardian results.

In this case, all future tax

We obtain partially

A one dollar tax cut increases consumption, but by less

than does a one dollar increment to wealth.

For reasonable parameter values,

the marginal propensity to consume out of such a tax cut is about half the
marginal propensity to consume out of wealth.
Third, we examine the impact of an announced future tax cut.

We show

that this announcement causes an immediate increase in the level of

—3—

consumption, followed by further increases in consumption as the tax cut
approaches.

Hence, while news about future taxes has an immediate impact on

consumption, anticipated changes in taxes are also associated with anticipated
changes in consumption.
Fourth, we derive an index of fiscal stance analogous to that suggested
by Blanchard (1985).

The index implies that fiscal policy has similar effects

on aggregate demand in precautionary-saving models and finite—horizon models,
even though the mechanisms are very different.

We share with much recent work the strategy of examining the implications
of capital market imperfections without deriving the imperfections from the
economic environment.

derive this feature from the more primitive informational considerations of

We hope that our model can provide a

prelude to a more complete analysis of the interactions between precautionary
saving and the timing of taxes.

A Special Case

To gain a better understanding of how the precautionary saving aotive
affects consumption, it is helpful to examine the precautionary saving effect
in the special case in which there are only two states —- a high income
state (state 1) and a low income state (state 2) -— and the transition matrix
A is symmetric; that is,

(2.16)

The quantity x is the ratio of marginal utilities between the high income and
low income states (for a given value of non—human wealth) in the initial
steady state.

Its value can be determined from the following equation, which

is derived by subtracting the steady—state version of (2.8) with i=1 from the
steady—state version of (2.8) with i=2, and then using the definition

of the initial tax cut and the initial addition to the

national debt as a result of that tax cut.

Equation (3.5) indicates that an

income tax cut followed by a compensating income tax increase the next year
has very little effect on consumption, but a tax cut followed by a tax
increase many years later has a much larger effect.

In other words, the

interval between tax cut and tax increase is crucial to the impact of the tax
cut.

Individuals face little uncertainty about their income next year and

there is correspondingly little insurance effect of higher income taxes next
year.

But individuals face much more uncertainty about their income ten or

twenty years from now and, as a result, higher income taxes ten or twenty
years in the future have a substantial insurance effect.
The theory presented here is one way to rationalize the intuitive notion
that tax rescheduling within a year or any other short period of time should
not have much effect, but that tax rescheduling over longer periods of time
should have

substantial effects

on consumption.

A common

debating point

for

—14—

Ricardians has been that if tax rescheduling within a year does not matter,
then tax rescheduling over the course of 20 years also should not matter.

We

have identified here a clear distinction between tax rescheduling over short
periods of time and tax rescheduling over long periods of time, even for
infinitely—lived consumers.

Some Illustrative Calculations

To judge the magnitude of the precautionary saving effects,
necessary to calibrate the model

it is

There are two key parameters:

y(y1-y2) and

From these two magnitudes, the other parameters of interest, such as

9

and ô/r, can be computed.10
The first parameter, y(y1-y2), incorporates both the degree of risk
aversion y and the cross-sectional dispersion in income (y1 y(y1-y2) can be written as 7y2Ny1/y2)—1] and that

Note that

we make the conservative assumption that income

income in the bad state, so that the cross-sectional coefficient of variation
in income is only 1/3, then y(y1-y2) can be interpreted simply as the
coefficient of relative risk aversion.

We therefore allow this parameter to

range over the region from 0.5 to 10.

The second parameter is p/r.

We allow

If r is 2 percent per year, then p is varying

from 0.2 percent per year to 10 percent per year.

To judge the magnitude of

p, note that over a 25-year horizon, the probability that an individual leaves

Hence, for a tax

out of the tax cut is 0.63 9 times the marginal propensity to consume out of

Table 3 presents x, the ratio of marginal utility in the bad state and
good state given equal non-human wealth in both states.

These numbers imply

that marginal utility in the bad state is about two to five times marginal
utility in the good state.

This ratio is, of course, larger if the

cross-sectional dispersion in income is larger, if individuals are more risk
averse, or if the transition probability is smaller relative to the interest
rate.

Whether this model gives results closer to full

Ricardian neutrality or naive neglect of future tax liabilities depends on the
parameters, but the best guess is probably halfway in between.12
The numbers in Table 5 are similar in magnitude to figures derived from a
life-cycle model of consumption.

Poterba and Summers (1987) simulate a

realistic model of life-cycle saving; they compute the fraction of government
debt that is net wealth assuming that taxes are levied to service the debt.
Their Table 1 reports that, depending on the parameters, this fraction varies
from 0.53 to 0.85.

Hence, the precautionary saving effect highlighted here

can potentially provide as great a deviation from the Ricardian benchmark as

does the finiteness of life.

Conclusion
This paper has analyzed rigorously the role of the timing of taxes in a

world in which taxes are contingent on individual income and individual income
is Subject

to non—diversifiable idiosyncratic risk.

Casual empiricism, as

well as the more formal empirical work discussed by Barsky, Mankiw, and
Zeldes, suggests that the sort of heterogeneity examined here is substantial
Such heterogeneity among individuals has potentially important aggregate
effects.

Under reasonable auxiliary assumptions, these aggregate effects can

be explicitly derived.
Previous authors analyzing the interaction between taxes and
precautionary saving have typically relied on two-period examples.

Our goal

—20—

has been to extend the analysis to a more general and more realistic setting.
The infinite horizon model presented here is much richer in its implications,
is more easily compared with standard dynamic models, and should prove a

useful guide for empirical work.

This insurance effect of the taxes also affects many other decisions,

such as the accumulation of human capital (Eaton and Rosen, 1980).

Some readers may wish to skip to the summary at the end of this section.

The assumption of a constant real interest rate is maintained throughout

this paper.

The model can be viewed as "partial equilibrium;" alternatively,

one can posit a small open economy or a linear storage technology.

One could guess that this would be so from the example of optimal

consumption with random income on p. 398 of Merton (1971).

Using the notstion defined below, since

'1

has row sums that add to zero,

it is a continuous-time Markov matrix and has all nonpositive eigenvalues.
Thus,

'Y

rI

has strictly negative eigenvalues, which proves by the implicit

function theorem that (2.8) has a unique steady-state solution for the vector
a given the vector y, since with a set to zero, totally differentiating
steady state version of (2.8) yields rj =

became large, the linearization

around the steady-state would become inappropriate, but these nonlinesrities
would not prevent the violation of the budget constraint.
9.

The marginal propensity to consume out of wealth, r, is the same as under

certainty equivalence when r=p.

The "excess sensitivity" discussed by Barsky,

Mankiw, and Zeldes arises with constant relative risk aversion but not with

—22—

constant absolute risk aversion.

The effect of uncertainty on the marginal

propensity to consume is discussed in Kimball (1988).

If uncertainti raises

the marginal propensity to consume, any departure from Ricardian equivalence
is magnified.
10.

The interest rate

r

can be viewed as fixing the time unit; all other

rates are given relative to the interest rate.
11.

In (2.21), a reduction in r may not at first reduce saving, since a lower

interest rate can increase the precautionary component of saving (see Table
4), but if r falls low enough, saving will begin to decline.
12.

It should be remembered that these numbers are based on the assumption

that all taxes fall on the high—labor—income half of the population.

Less

progressive taxation would lead to smaller effects, as discussed below.
13.

The parameter 5 should not be interpreted as simply a risk premium.

The

higher discount rate arises from a precautionary saving effect (a pos,tive
third derivative) rather than from risk aversion (a negative second
derivative).

For instance, in the case of quadratic utility, certainty

equivalence obtains:

the precautionary saving effects are absent, despite the

presence of risk aversion.
