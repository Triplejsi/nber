Background

Firm Pension Plan Provisions.
Approximately 75 percent of American workers are covered by defined

benefit pension plans.

These plans proaiee the employee a benefit at

retirement that is typically based on age, years of service, and his final
salary (or an average of earnings in the last few years of employment).
Within this general framework,

the benefit formulas of most plans provide a

large incentive to remain with the firm until some age and then a substantial
incentive

to leave the firm at some later age.

provisions and their variation among plans are described in detail by
Kotlikoff and Wise [1985]

Because the incentives vary so greatly among

plans, to analyze the effects of plan provisions on retirement,

it is

necessary to account for the precise provisions of an employee's plan.

It is

also critical to have information on past and current earnings in the firm.
For these reasons, we rely on firm personnel

records for this analysis.

The easiest way to understand the incentive effects of pension plans is
to consider the relationship between age and total compensation -

Notes: All values are in 1980 dollars, calculated assuming a 5 percent
inflation rate. Income forecasts were computed using the estimated
income forecasting equation shown in appendix B. The individual was 50
years old on January 1, 1981, the date to which these calculations
correspond; he will accumulate 30 years of experience during the
in
which he reaches age 60. The adjusted pension benefits are paid year
until
he is 65, and are only available if he retires between ages 55 and 65.
The social security benefits are unavailable until he is 62; the
reported benefits correspond to the benefits he would receive if he
collected them starting at age 62, or during the first year of his
retirement, whichever is later.

II.

The model proposed here incorporates the advantages of both of the
approaches

described above.

It allows updating of information, as does the

traditional hazard model, but also considers potential compensation many years

in the future, as does the nonlinear budget constraint approach.

of our work begin with Lazear and Moore [1988], who argue that the option

as well.
Thus his model allows the individual to optimize over age
of retirement and future consumption jointly. The choices are assumed to be
equivalent to the solution to a dynamic programming problem. As in our case,
the individual's expectations are conditioned on current known variables like
income. The idea is to recover the parameters of a utility function specified
in terms of these choice variables. In practice, though, he uses income to

well as firm pension benefits play the central role in our analysis. We
estimate a discount, or weighting factor, whereas they obtain estimates of
other parameters conditional on an assumed discount rate. Age itself is used
explicitly to estimate retirement. As will be emphasized below, age is not a
direct determinant of retirement in our model. This has important
implications if the model is to be used to predict the effect of changes in

The effect of a change from the existing defined benefit to a defined

The first assumption

is that the defined benefit contribution rate is such that for a person who

has 30 years of service at age 60, the fair annuity value of the amount in the
defined contribution fund is the same as the present value of the retirement

benefits that the person would receive from the defined benefit plan were he

But, the departure

and 54 would be increased from around 3 to about 10 percent, close to the
departure

rate between 55 and 59, after the early retirement age, under the

existing plan.

It is also close to the departure rate of employees who are

under 50 and have just become vested in the existing firm plan.

The net

effect is to increase significantly

the proportion of those employed st age 50

who have left the firm before age 60.

These results support the view that

defined benefit plans provide a strong and effective incentive for employees
to stay in the fira until some age and then a strong and effective incentive
to retire at some later age.

The defined contribution plan does neither.

Although these results are based on the retirement decisions of employees
in only one large firm, it is important to understand that the incentive
effects inherent in this firm's pension plan are very typical of defined
benefit plans.

Nonetheless,

we will in future work determine whether the

results are supported in similar analysis based on data from other firms.

hand, it suggests chat an appropriate formulation of the proportional
model might be used to describe retirement behavior, avoiding the multiple
integrals

inherent in (2.15) and (2.16).

On the other hand, the derivation

makes clear how restrictive the assumptions underlying the proportional hazard
specification

are.

The derivation also provides a link between the utility

maximization problem discussed in section II and the conventional proportional
hazard model, which is typically presented in an ad-hoc manner with little
economic motivation.

While this derivation suggests covariates for its

estimation (namely those entering g(r)), it also makes its weaknesses more
apparent.

Appendix B:

Wage ForecastingEquation

The estimation procedure uses earnings forecasts to compute the expected
value of the utility of future income, both when employed and after
retirement.

Pension benefits depend on the entire earnings history of the

individual at the firm up to the date of retirement.

Thus pension benefits

for future dates of retirement are in genecal based on both earnings history,
known to the individual at the current date, and forecasts of future earnings.
For example,

in 1981, estimates of the pension benefits that would be received

were retirement in 1986 involve known earnings through 1981 and forecasts for
the remaining years.
The income forecasting equation, shown in table 8-1, was estimated
using
98,465 observations,

including multiple observations for the same person,

taken from a panel of individuals in the same job category in the same firm as
the 1500 individuals that were used in the estimation
text.

The earnings data covet 1969-1984.

results reported in the

Nominal earnings were converted to

1980 dollars using the consumer price index.

St and At respectively denote

years of service at the firm and age; 072, 073, etc. are dummy variables for
the indicated years.

Income forecasts were computed using the average of the

coefficients on the dummy variables

for 1978-1980, where the 1980 coefficient

is normalized to be zero.
The data set contains earnings from 1969 on.

Thus earnings before 1969

(for those who joined the firm before 1969) were back-cast using a

specification similar to the forecasting equation in table 8-1.
(not reported here) were obtained using the same specification,
