THE SEASONAL CYCLE AND THE BUSINESS CYCLE

ABSTRACT

all recent researchon macroeconomic fluctuations has worked with seasonallyadjusted
or annual data. This paper takes a different approach by treating seasonal fluctuations as worthy
of study in their own right. We document the quantitative importance of seasonalfluctuations, and
Almost

we present estimates of the seasonal patterns in a set of standard macroeconomicvariables. Our
results show that seasonal fluctuations are an important source of variation in all macroeconomic
quantity variables but small or entirely absent in bothreal and nominal price variables. The timing

of the seasonal fluctuations consists of increases in the second and fourth quarter, a large decrease
in the first quarter, and a mild decrease in the third quarter.
The paper demonstrates that, with respect to each of several majorstylizedfacts about business
cycles, the seasonal cycle displays the same characteristics as the business cycle, in some cases even
more dramatically than the business cycle. That is, we find that at seasonal frequencies as well as
at business cycle frequencies, output movements across broadly defined sectors move together, the
timing of production and sales coincide closely, labor productivity is procyrlical, nominal money
and real output are highly correlated, and prices vary less than quantities. There is a "seasonal
business cycle" in the United States economy, and its characteristics mirror closely those of the
conventionalbusiness cycle.

I. Introduction
Almost all recent researchon macroeconomic fluctuations has worked with seasonally adjusted

The usual attitude toward seasonal fluctuations is typified by Sims (1974), who
to the seasonal components of economic time series as "errors in variables" and analyzes

or annual data.
refers

methods for treating series "contaminated by seasonal noise." Perhaps underlying this view is the
notion that seasonal fluctuations are generated by a fundamentally different model than conventional business cycle fluctuations. One immediate distinction, of course, is between the anticipated
nature of seasonal fluctuations and the unanticipated and irregular nature of business cycle fluctuations. Further, many economists would argue that seasonal fluctuations are entirely natural or
even desirable while business cycle fluctuations entall large welfare losses.
This paper takes a different approach from previous research by treating seasonal fluctuations
as worthy of study in their own right. Instead of taking it for granted that seasonal fluctuations
follow a different model from business cycle fluctuations, we consider the extent to which the two
types of fluctuations display similarities. Our paper represents a return to an older traditionof
NBER analysis of fluctuations,exemplified by Simon Kuznets (1933), in which fluctuations at both
seasonal and business cycle frequencies were regarded as important topics of investigation.t
below, we document the quantitative importance of seasonal fluctuations, and
we present estimates of the seasonal patterns in a set of standard macroeconomic variables. Our

In Section III

results show that seasonal fluctuations are an important source of variation in all macroeconomic
quantity variables, including consumption, investment, governmentpurchases, employment, and

the money stock. On the other hand, seasonal fluctuations are small or entirely absent in both real
and nominal price variables. The timing of the seasonal fluctuations in economic activity consists of
increases in the second and fourth quarter, a large decrease in the first quarter, and a mild decrease

in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter boom, output

business cycles, the seasonal cycle displays the same characteristics as the business cycle, in some

nominal money and real output are highly correlated, and prices vary less than quantities. There
is a "seasonal business cycle" in the United States economy, and its characteristics mirror closely
those of the conventionalbusiness cycle.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section

II outlines a simple estimation

•strategy for presenting facts about the seasonal cycle and comparing the seasonal cycle to the
business cycle. Section III oses this strategy to show that the seasonal cycle is a quantitatively
important feature of the data and to document the seasonal patterns in major macroeconomic
variables. In Section IV we compare the seasonal cycle to the business cycle and show that the
seasonal cycle in the United States economy displays the important qualitative features of the
business cycle. Section V concludes the paper.

II. Comparing the Seasonal Cycle and the Business Cycle
In this section we outline our statistical approach to quantifying and presenting seasonal patterns in quarterly macroeconomic time series. We follow Hylleberg (1986,Ch.2) and especially
Pierce (1978) in considering a model that includes both deterministicand stochastic seasonal components. In contrast to the standard literature, however, we focus mainly on the deterministic
seasonals

—

those which

are representable by seasonal dummy variables.

Our emphasis on deterministicseasouality reflects three observationswhich, although logically
distinct, cohere well. First, the empiricalresults presented in Section III suggest that deterministic
seasonals go a long way toward accountingfor the variation in the data, while models of stationary
indeterministicseasonalityplay a secondary role. Second, as noted below, if deterministic seasonals
are present but not accounted for, inferences about seasonal comovements based on coherences are

a priori reasoning about the economics of seasonality suggests the
of
inadequacy purely indeterministic models in capturing the key characteristics of seasonals in
real world data. A stationary indeterministic model implies that the unconditional first quarter
mean of a series is equal to the unconditional fourth quarter mean. This in turn implies that the
long-run forecast of a series is independentof the quarter being forecast. Of course, a nonstationary
indeterministic model - one with a unit root at the fourth lag - would allow seasonality to enter
the long-run forecasts (Bell (1987)). However, that approach would still fail to use the information
that Christmas falls in the same quarter every year.
Let X be a times series of interest. We wish to estimate the seasonal variation in the nontrend componentof X. In order to insure that our conclusions about seasonality are not sensitive
to the choice of detrending technique, we employ two alternative definitions of trend and estimate
essentially incorrect. Finally,

the seasonal variation in both detrended series. The first representation of trend that we consider
is that of a unit root in the ARIMA representation of the indeterministic component oflnXt.
Recent work by Nelson and Plosser (1982), Campbell and Mankiw (1986), and others2 indicates

that this specification may be more consistent with observed data than the specificationthat lnX
is stationary aronnd a deterministictrend.3 The second model that we employ is the spline function
prnposed by Hodrick and Prescott (1980). Let r1 be the trend component of lnX1. The T8 are
chosen to minimize
—

rt)2

+ 1600 ((rt+t — Ye) — (r5 — r1_1

the detrended variable is defined to be the difference between lnX1 and Ti. This model allows
the trend component of In X to change slowly over time. Note that the interpretation of the
detrended series is different for the two models. The first produces log growth rates, the second
and

percentagedeviations from trend.5
Now let x1 be the detrended series produced by one of the two procedures described above.
We assume that Xt can be approximatelydescribed by the following model:

deterministic seasonal dummies and a stationary moving average process. This specification allows
for both deterministic and stochastic seasonality in cc. If the seasonal dummy coefficients are
not all identical, then the series displays deterministic seasonality. If the polynomial /3(L) implies

Clark (1986), Cochrane (1586), Evans (1986), Stock and Watson (1586), and Watson (1986) also find that
one cannot reject the hypothesis of a unit toot in the onieariate ARIMA representation of resi, seasonally
adjusted fIN?. They reach a range of conclusions, however, about the quantitativeimportance of the permanent
component.

The fact that one cannot reject the hypothesis of a unit root does not imply that one is pcesent, since tests
for unit roots tend to have llmited power (Shiller and Perrsn (1985)). We also note that existing analysm
of trends versus unit roots have been carried out with annual and/or seasonally adjusted data, so the results
do not preclude the possibility that the unadjusted data are consistent with deterministic trends. ilnaza and
Fuller(t9s2) and Dickey, Haana, and Fuller (1984) address the issue of testing for unit roots (at the first and/or
seasonal lag) in seasonally unadjusted data. fIhysels (5987) suggests that the use of seasonally adjusted data
may bias unit root tests in the direction of rejecting deterministic trends.
This is also the detrending procedure employed in Kydlandand Prescott (1982) and Prescott (1986).
We have also estimated a third model, a second order polynomial function of time, with results extremely
simllar to those obtained using the procedure advocated by Hodrick and Prescott (1980).

x1, then the series displays stochastic seasonality.8 Economic time series typically display both

deterministic and stochastic seasonality (Pierce (1978)).
As we emphasized earlier, it is important to allow for deterministic seasonality because a
number of phenomena causing the seasouals in economic time series (holidays, school calendars,
the weather) tend to produce seasonal peaks and troughs in the same season year after year.
The magnitudes of the effects of these factors may change over time, so it might be desirable to
allow for time variation in the magnitude of the seasonal dummy coefficients (Stephenson and Farr
(1972), Hylleherg (1986)). As we demonstrate in Tables A1—A8 of the appendix, however, the

estimated seasonal dummy coefficients are strikingly similar when estimated separately for the first
and second half of the post-WWII sample period. We therefore do not find it important to allow

for time variation in the seasonal dummy coefficients in highlightingthe first order effects that are
the topic of this paper.
In order to analyze the seasonal variationin economic times series, we examine the deterministic
seasonals, i.e., the regular seasonal peaks and troughs in the series. For this purpose we estimate
the equation
(2)

Ordinary Least Squares estimates of the seasonal
dummy coefficients are consistent.7 The error term in equation (2), the stochastic component of
x1, need not be serially uncorrelated, however, so the OLS standard errors are not appropriate. We

apply the Hansen and Hodrick (1980) technique, as modified by Newey and West (1987), to obtaln
consistentestimates of the standard errors of the seasonal dummy coefficients.8
We employ two procedures to determine the relationships between the seasonal components

of different

series. The first is to use instrumental variables, with seasonal dummies as the only

6 As
long as j3(L) can be infinite order,

the model in (1) is censistent with any stationary ARMA model for the
stochasticses.sonality in tg. In practice, we find that most of the series we consider are well approximated by
an AR(S) plus seasonal dummies, where the coefficients on lags one through three are small and insignificant
and the coefficients on lags four and five are larger and more significant. For example, the coefficients on the
first five AR terms in real output are 12,-si, -.14, .38, and -.49. Only the last two are significantly different
from zero.

OLS estimatesof the seasonal dummy coefficients are also asymptotically efficient (Fuller (157e),pp.358-93), so
for samples of the size we employ here there is probably little galn to estimating the model by GLS.
A second procedure for analyzing the sessonality of a series is to examine its spectrum (Nerlove (15e4)). One
limitation of this approach from our point of view is that the estimated spectrum of a series provides information
on the amount of seasonal variation, but not on the timingof this variation. The timing and magnitude of the
peaks and troughs in the series are of crucial interest for onr purposes. We also note that if a series contalns
seasonality due to seasonal dummies, its spectrum is not well defined. The theoreticalspectrum contalnsspikes
of infiniteheight at the seasonal frequencies, while the estimatedspectrum displays spikes of finite height that
increase with sample size (Priestly (1981)1.

instruments, to estimate the relation betweeo two variables. The coefficient estimate produced by
this IV procedure is identical to that from regressing the seasonal dummy pattern in ooe variable
on the seasonal dummy pattern in the other variable, but it produces a standard error for this
coefficient estimate that reflects the sample size used in estimating the seasonal dummy patterns.
The second procedure is to examine the coherence and gain of the cross spectrum of the two
variables. The coherence function between two series, Xt and

y, is interpreted as the correlation

coefficient by frequency, while the gain function from Xt to Ft is interpreted as the (absolute value
of the) regression coefficient of Ft on Xt by frequency. The coherences that we present are those
of the seasonal dummy adjusted series; these coherences therefore inform us about the relation
between the stochastic seasonality in the two series. We examine these, rather than the coherences
of the seasonally unadjusted series, because the coherence of two series containing deterministic
seasonalityis always unity at the principal seasonal frequency.5 The gain functions that we report

are those relating the pure, seasonally unadjusted data. These are meaningfuleven in the presence
of deterministic seasonality.

III. Basic Facts About the Seasonal Cycle
In this section

we document the seasonalpatterns in macroeconomic variablesand demonstrate

that seasonal fluctuations accountfor a significant share of the non-trend variation in these variables.
We present results for both the log growth rates of the variables and for Hodrick-Prescottdetrended
data, although we focus more on the results for log growth rates. The qualitative results presented
in this and the subsequentsection of the paper are not sensitive to the choice between growth rates
and Hodrick-Prescott detrended data.
A. The Quantitative Importance of Seasonal Fluctuations

Table 1 presents three statistics for each of a set of key quarterly macroeconomic variables for
the period 1948:2-1985:4.' The left side of the table contains results for log growth rates while
the right side contains results for detrended series.11 Each statistic is computed from a regression

or deviations from trend on seasonal dummies. The first statistic is
the standard deviation of the fitted values of the regression; this is an estimate of the standard
of either log growth rates

This follows from the fact that the spectral power is dominated by the deterministic component.
The sample period is different for Residential Investment (554s:2-ssel:4); Monetary Base and Money Mnltiplier
(19s9:2-issS:4); aod Hours, Nominal aod Real Wage (1964:2-1985:4).
For some of the series we etcamioe (the unemployment rate and the nominal interest rate), we delrend the level
of the series rather than the log level. For real interest rates, we do not detrend at all. For inventories, we work
with the noo-detrended valnes of the chuoge in inventories divided by final sales. The resolts for these last two
variables are oeported in the tables for tog growth rates.

deviation of the deterministic seasonal componentof the dependent variable. The second statistic
is the standard error of the regression; this is an estimate of the standard deviation of the business
cycle plus stochastic seasonal componentof the dependent variable. The third statistic is the R2
of the regression, which measures the percentage of the variation in the dependent variable due to

deterministicseasonality.
The standard deviation of the deterministicseasonal component in the log growth rate of real
GNP is estimated to he 5.06%, while that of the deviations from trend is estimated to be 2.87%.
Deterministic seasonal fluctuationsr account for more than 85% of the fluctuations in the rate of
growth of real output and more than 55% of the (percentage) deviationsfrom trend. Business cycle
fluctuations and/or stochastic seasonal fluctuations represent a relatively small percentage of the
fluctuations in real output. Plots of the log level of real output (Figure 1) and the log growth rate
of real output (Figure 2) make this point even more clearly. The seasooal fluctuations in output
are so large and regular that the timing of the peak or trough quarter for any year is rarely affected
by the phase of the business cycle in which that year happens to fall.
Deterministic seasonal fluctuations are present in every major component of GNP, as well as
in virtually all other macroeconomic quantity variables such as employment or the money stock.
The standard deviation of the seasonal dummies is particularly large in consumption purchases of
durables and non-durables, residential fixed investment, and non.defense government purchases.
while the fraction of total variation explained by the seasonal dummies is largest for consumption
purchases

of durables and non-durables. Seasonal

dummies also explain a quantitatively important

percentage of the fluctuations in the labor market variables (approximately two thirds of the log
growth rates), although the magnitude of the seasonal dummies is smaller than in many of the
national income accounts. Seasonal dummies account for approximately 50% of the variation in

the log growth rate of money.
Seasonal movements in both real and nominalprice variables are noticeably smaller than those

in quantity variables. For example, the standard deviation of the seasonals in the growth rates of
prices is .21%, and seasonal dummies explain only 3.1% of the total variation. The same conclusions
hold qualitatively for real interest rates, nominal wages, and real wages. There appears

to be no

deterministic seasonalityin nominal interest rates.
B. The Seosonol Patterns in Macroeconomic Variables
The second step in our examination of the seasonal fluctuations in the economy is to display
the estimated seasonal patterns in the macroeconomic variables considered above. These patterns

are presented in Table 2, with the log growth rates in Table 2a and the deviations from trend in

Table 2b.'2 The entries in the tables are the OLS estimates of the coefficients on the seasonal
dummies from Equation (2). In each case we have subtracted the overall mean of the dependent
variable from each dommy coefficient; the entries in the tables are therefore interpreted either as
the difference between the averagegrowth rate of the variablein that quarter and the overallgrowth
rate, or, as the averagepercentage deviation of the variable from trend in that quarter. For ease of
presentation, we have not included the standard errors on the coefficients.13 For all variables other
than the nominal interest rate, the data reject the null hypothesis of no deterministic seasonality

at the 99% level of confidence.'4
The coefficient estimates in Table 2a show that the growth rate of real output is strongly
positive in the second and fourth quarters, strongly negative in the first quarter, and insignificantly
oegative in the third qnarter. Looking at the deviations from trend in Table 2b, we see that
output is, on average, well below trend in the first quarter, slightly below trend in the second
and third quarters, and well above trend in the fourth qoarter. The growth rates from quarter to
quarter implied by the deviations from trend are strikingly similar to the results on the growth
rates themselves. For example, the implied growth rates in real GNP are -8.07%, 3.74%, -.51%.
and 4.84%.
The seasonal patterns in the growth rates and deviationsfrom trend in consumption purchases
of durables and non-durables are similar in timing but greater in amplitude than those in output
as a whole. The seasonal patterns in government purchases are also dominated by first quarter
declines and fourth quarter peaks. Fixed investment behaves somewhat differently, however. It
grows most strongly in the second quarter, grows slightly in the third quarter, declines weakly in
the fourth quarter, and declines strongly in the first quarter. This implies, consistent with Table

2b, that the deviations from trend reach their peak in the third quarter and their trough in the
first quarter.
12

TablesAl—As of the appendix show ths same information as in Tables 1 and 2a-2b for twe sub-ssmples of the
1948-1985 period. Although a few variables display somewhal different seasonal patterns in the two periods,
the magnitudes of the changes in the patterns are usually small in comparison to the magnitudes of the seasonal
patterns themselves. For example, the change in the amplitndeof the seasonal dummy pattern in real GNP
is only 2.48%, while the amplitude of the pattern is 14.17% in the first sob-sample and 11.69% in lhe second.
Exceptions of importance are noted where they occur; see in particalar the discussion of money and output in
Section IV.D.

t3 The standard errors are in general quite small, implying precise estimates of the seasonal dummy coefficients.
For exasnple, the OLS standard errors on the seasonal dsmmy coefficients in the log growth rate of output are
.32, .31, .31, and .31., while the Hansen and Hodrick standard errors are .38, .3t, .34, and .30.
t4 We have carried ont these tests ssing the Hansen and Hodrick (1980) procedure, with the lag length set eqnal
to 4. The variance-covariance matrix was cumpnted using a damp factor of I to insure positive definiteness of
the matrix (Duan and Litterman (1986), Newey and West (1987)).

There are of course some exceptions to these overall tendencies. The growth rates and deviations from trend of consumption purchases of services show a first quarter peak rather than a
fourth quarter peak. Residential investment shows strong growth in the third quarter as well as
in the second quarter.15 State and local governmentpurchases reach their peak level in the third
quarter. None of these exceptions, however, is sufficiently strong to overturn the basic patterns
described in the previous paragraph. In particular, the decline in measured output from the fourth
quarter to the first quarter occurs in almost every componentof economic activity.
The movements in the labor market variables are for the most part procyclical, particularly
with respect to the large decrease in output from the fourth quarter

to the

first quarter. The

unemploymentrate increases markedly (1 percentagepoint) from the fourth quarter to the first, and
declines somewhat moving into each successive quarter, most notably the second. The labor force
and average hours per employee increase moving into the second and again into the third quarter,
but (perhaps surprisingly) decrease in the fourth quarter, contrary to the behavior of output.
Employment (as measured by the Establishment Survey) falls sharply from the fourth quarter to
the first and then rises in each successive quarter, peaking in the fourth (1% above trend).'6 Total
hours (average hours times entploytnent) increase only slightly from the third quarter to the fourth
quarter. The explanation for the apparently anomalouscountercyclicalbehavior of the labor force
nsay be that there are large numbers of withdrawals by workers whose productivity is low, namely
teenagers and agricultural workers.'7
The seasonal dummy components in the price variables are far smaller than those in the
quantity variables. For example, the largest seasonal factor in the price level is only .19% in the
log growth rates and .16% in the deviations from trend. Thus, although the seasonal patterns are
statistically different from zero in all price variables other than the nominal interest rate, these
variables are essentiallyacyclical at the seasonal frequencies.
The money stock and the monetary base are both generally procyclical, showing significant

16

'

Unlike investment as a whole, investment expenditure on producers'durables tends to be high in the second
and fourth quarters. Although this may appear somewhat puzzling, see footnote 15.
Because of the nature of data collection, employment may be overstated in the third quarter in particular.
This is because the establishment sorvey counts as employed anyone who is reported by firms as receiving
compensation, including those on vacation. (Employees on strike or taking sick leave are also reported as
employed).
Together with John Bound we are in the process of conducting a detailed investigation of the seasonality of
monthly labor market variables and their interactions with productivity movements. We do not yet have an
explanationfor the decline in average hours in the foorth qnarter, but we suspect that labor force aggregation
issues may be an important part of the story. We note that the data collected by BLS are not affected by the
fact that there are more holidays in December than in most other months, since the BLS sampling procedure
uses data from the week of the month containing the 12th day of the month.

amplitude of the seasonal in the base is smaller than that in Ml, reflecting the procyclicality of
the money multiplier. Between the base and the money multiplier,it is the base that exhibits the
greater seasonal fluctuations. The amplitude of the seasonal in money

is

considerablysmaller than

The patterns of seasonal fluctuations in economic activity documented above suggest that
Christmas and the weather are the primary determinants of the seasonality of economic activity,
with Christmas playing the greater role. The large increases in consumption spending on durables
and non-durables in the fourth quarter are almost certalnly related to Christmas, while the increases
in investment spending on structures in the second and third quarter are likely a reflection of the
weather conditions in the spring and summer. The increases in purchases of producers' durables
in the fourth quarter, rather than in the second or third, may reflect installation of those parts of
structures which are put into place indoors at laterstages of construction.15 The large decreases in
virtually all kinds of economic activity from the fourth quarter to the first quarter plausibly reflect
both the end of the Christmas season and the comparativelypoor weather in the first quarter.

IV. The Seasonal Cycle and the Business Cycle
The stylized facts about the economy that collectively constitute the business cycle phenomenon are, for the most part, facts about the correlations between various macroeconomic
variables.20 In this section we examine whether these correlations are present at seasonal as well as
at business cycle frequencies. After reviewing a number of specific stylized facts we note that, with
respect to all of these correlations, the seasonal cycle is just like the business cycle. This result,
that the seasonal cycle and the business cycle are so similar, is perhaps the most intriguing result
of the paper.
A. The Behavior of Aggregate Output
The most basic feature of the business cycle is the first one discussed by Lucas (1977) in his
now famous article on understanding business cycles: output movements across broadly defined
sectors move together. We have demonstrated above that this phenomenon also occurs at the
seasonal frequencies, i.e., there is a quantitatively important aggregate seasonal cycle. Indeed, the
seasonal cycle

is

more pronounced than the business cycle for most quantity variables. Although

As we discuss in Section IV.D., the trough in the level of money is in the second quarter rather than the first.

the timing of the seasonal peaks and troughs differs to some extent across different components of
output, the overall tendenciesare sufficiently similar that a large seasonal cycle remains. As shown
in Table 2, the large decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter occurs "across the hoard."
In the language of traditional NBER business cycle analysis, conformity across sectors is high.
A priori reasoning leaves some doubt as to whether one would expect aggregate seasonal cycles

of the magnitude documented above to

be a characteristic of modern economies. Although

an
implausible that

agricultural economy might be dominated by a weather induced cycle, it seems
weather effects would be important enough to drive most sectors of, say, the post—WWII United
Ststes economy. Some activities, such as residential construction, can prnceed at least cost when
the weather is "good." For many other activities, however, the temperature extremes associated
with summer or winter are costly (high air conditioning/heating costs), so these activities should
have spring or autumn peaks.

The large seasonal in activity is particularly surprising relative to standard neo-classical models that assume convex costs of production. If production functions are everywhere concave and
there are no seasonals in production or preferences, then output should be produced nearly evenly
throughout the year. If there are seasunals in technology or the taste for work, then of course production should he seasonal,ceteris przribus, even with concave within period production functions.
It is far from obvious, however, what might constitute aggregate seasonals in technology.
B. Production Smoothing and the Elasticity of Aggregate Supply
An important point suggested by the striking similarity of the seasonal patterns in production
and sales (see Table 2), is that the production smoothing tendencies of the economy at seasonal
frequencies are minimal at best. 'F his is a point that has been emphasized at business cycle frequencies by Blinder (1986). Whileit is true that inventory investment is on averagepositive in the
first quarter, the magnitsde of the effect is trivial in comparison to the seasunals in production and
sales. This coincidence of final sales and output (the failure of "production smoothing") is documented in detail by Miron and Zeldes (1988), who find that the seasonals in production in 2-digit

manufacturingmatch almost precisely the seasonals in shipments.21 The seasonal evidence against
21

The evidence is Miron and Zeldes (l9ss) is probably more convincing than that prnvided in this paper, for two
reasons. First, Miron and Zeldes use a measure of physical ostpst (the Index of Industrial Production) and an
alternate measure of mannfactsringontpot based on national acconnts typedata and reach the same conclusion
using both types of data. Second, their results are for the goods represented by six 2-digit mannfactoring

production smoothing is perhaps even more striking than the business cycle evidence because the
anticipated, transitory fluctuations in demand represented by seasonals are precisely the ones that
should be most easily smoothed via inventory accumulations(Miron and Zeldes (1988)).
One natural interpretation of the large expansion in output that occors in the fourth quarter
of each year is that there is a taste shift doe to Christmas, and with price above marginal cost and

marginal cost not increasingrapidly with output (Hall (1988)), firms gladly meet the fourth quarter
demand increase. The Christmas taste shift, which raises desired consumption purchases for given
permanent income and real interest rates, provides a more concrete example of a consumption shift
than those inferred by Hall (1984) at business cycle frequencies. Accordingto this view, Christmas
pruvides an identifyingrestriction that tells us that the demand curve is shifting and that aggregate
supply is highly elastic. This view, of cuurse, is a static one that interprets each period's price and
quantity outcome as the intersection of that period's aggregate demand and supply curves.
An alternative framework for understanding the high coincidence of pruduction and sales at
seasonal frequencies relies on the view that firms' natural unit of analysis may be a calendar year.
Under this scenario, retailers and their suppliers spend the early part of the year planning and
preparing for the high demand season in the fourth quarter. An implication is that the first quarter

is associated with considerable unmeasured output in the form of strategy sessions, blueprints,
ur retooling.22 The fact that physical output is not smoothed may suggest that marginal cnst is
rather flat, perhaps due tu idle labor or excess capacity (Hall (1986)). In the absence of strong
discounting, flat marginal cost makes the temporal pattern of production nearly indeterminate.
In addition to discounting, the valoe of waiting to acqoire information on the precise pattern and
nature of demand, including styles or taste fads, may help explain the tendency of firms to delay

production until the fail.23
C. The Procyclical Behavior

of Labor Productivity

One of the better known stylized facts about business cycles is

that labor productivity is

procyclical. The empirical elasticity ofoutput with respect to labor input (measured in hours) is not
only greater than labor's share in output (the value implied by constant returns and competition)
22 Fay and Medoff
(1985)
23 We should note one

providedirect evidence of such unmeasured output at business cycle frequencies.

potential complication to this story that arises from our work in progress on the seasonality
of monthly manufacturing production. In virtually all 2-digit manufacturing industries, there are two features
of the seasonal patterns that require mention. First, production falls strongly one to three months before
Christmas. This feature of the data is consistent with the discussioo above, so long as there are noo-trivial
lags in movinggoods from manufacturing establishments to retail stores. Second, there is a dramatic decline in
production in July, followed by a strong increase in August. This feature of the data suggests a more detailed
story that involves preferences for vacations in July.

14

but is actually somewhatgreater than unity (e.g., Prescott (1986)reports an elasticity of 1.1)24 The
traditional view of procyclicallabor productivity (e.g., Dornhusch and Fischer (1987)), interprets
the finding as reflecting labor hoarding during recessions, perhaps coupled with variation in the
utilization of capital services (on the latter see also Lucas (1970)).25 More recently, Kydland and
Prescott (1982) and Prescott (1986) have inferred that procyclical labor productivity may reflect
shocks

to the underlying technology.26

Figure 3 shows a plot of real GNP growth and total hours growth against time.27 At both
seasonal and non-seasonal frequencies, peaks in hours growth are associated with magnified peaks
in the growth of real GNP, i.e., labor productivity is procyclical. To pin down the magnitude of this
relationship at the seasonal as well as at the business cycle frequencies, we present the estimated
gain function from hours growth to output growth in Figure 4. At both the seasonal and the
conventionalbusiness cycle frequencies, the gain function takes on values in the neighborhood of

That labor productivity is particularly procyclical at the seasonal frequencies is hardly surprising if one takes the view that labor hoarding (in the sense of overhead labor as well as idle
labor retained by the firm during recessions) combined with variation in aggregate demand is the
fundamental source of procyclical productivity. Although there are certainly examples of seasonal
work (e.g., nsigrant farm workers) and seasonal layoffs in the context of more permanent jobs (e.g.,
construction workers), most jobs are year round. Furthermore, though hours per employee are

A closely related phenomenon is "Okun's Law" — a one peccentagepoint decreasein unemployment is associated
with a two to three percent increase in real GNP. The Okun's law relation reflects the behavior of labor force
participation in addition to procyclical labor productivity and procydical hours per employee.
Rotemberg and Summers (1988) stress that procydical labor productivity (in the sense of an riasticity of
output with respect to labor input of greater than unity)is a very likely consequence of overhead labor, or any
labor input that is sot instantaneously adjusted us demand varies, Hall (1988) also featureslabor hoarding but
raises the point that this does sot account for the fact that total factor productivity(i.e. the Solow residual) is
procyclical, as it in fact is. unless priceexceeds marginal cost. Hall attribut this excess of priceover marginal
cost to pervasive monopoly power. Rotemberg and Summers, on the other hand, present a model featuring
labor hoarding in which pricecannut easy freely with the state of demand, and in which some quantity rationing
occurs in the highest demand state. Then price is above marginal cost whenever output is below capacity, and
this is sufficient to yielda pcocydical Sotow residual. As we discuss further below, the Rotemberg and Summers
model may be particularlyrelevant to seasonal variation.

Prescott's model(s) imply elasticities of 1.3 to 1.9. while he estimates the empirical elasticity to be 1.1. Thus
one challenge faced by Prescott is to avoid the implication of excessively procycical productivity, rather thus
to account for prncyclical productivity.
The results discussed in this subsection use the same measure of employment used in Tables 1-2, sanely total
non-agricultural employment as measured by the Establishment Survey. We have also conductedthe analysis
with the Household measureof employment, with quite similar results.
'rVe have also computed analogues to Figures 3—4 using the (Hodrick-Prescott) detrended data. Tteoe figures
are quite similar to those presented in the paper.

somewhat procyclical

at the seasonal

frequencies, the forty hour a week job still appears to be the

modal case. Yet the amount of business faced by firms varies a great deal over the seasons. Hence
real GNP varies more than employee hours and labor productivity is procyclical.25
On the other hand, it seems hard to account for the seasonal variation in labor productivity
by relying solely on changes in technologicalopportunities (as in Prescott (1986)). We do suspect
that the weather plays an important role in the recovery of GNP from the first to the second

and is attributable to increased sales ofdurable goods (the Christmas induced demand expansion),
which is not accompanied by much increase in hours of work. Hence, while not denying some role
for unembellished shifts in technological opportunities, and while noting that such shifts in the
to procyclical productivity (i.e.,
presence of less than fully utilized labor contribute even further
cost shifts as well as demand shifts lead firms to use their hoarded labor more fully), we conclude

that the seasonal cycle provides

D. The Relntion Between Money ond Output
As a result of the pioneering work of Friedman and Schwartz (1963a,1982), all macroeconomists
are acutely aware of the strong correlation between movements in the quantity of nominal money
and movements in real output. Whether this correlationreflects a causal mechanism running from
to output, and if so which mechanism,is a matter of much dispute. In Keynesian models
money

relies on sticky nominal prices. In the
(e.g., Fischer (1977)), the correlationreflects causation that
Rational Expectations with Misperceptions models (Lucas (1972,1973,1977)), the correlation also
reflects causation from money to output, but it is the result of information imperfections. King
and Plosser (1984) illustrate in a real, equilibrium business cycle model that the correlation may

reflect reverse causality from output to money,

a point made earlier by Keynesian opponents of

monetarism (Tobin (1970)).

the seasonal factors presented in Table 2. Both money and output show strong growth between

at business

the third and fourth quarters. The levels of both peak in the fourtb quarter and then fall markedly
going into the first quarter. Money and output do not move together between the first and second
quarters. Clearly the fourth quarter comovementdominates. The regressionof the seasonal pattern
in real output growth on the seasonal pattern in nominal money growth gives a coefficient of 2.84,
with a standard error of .38.' The standard deviation of the seasonal fluctuations in output is

consistentlygreater (by a factor of four) than that in money. Friedman and Schwartz (1963b) found
that at the business cycle frequencies the magnitude of the fluctuations in output exceeds that in
money by a factor of two.
Figure 6 displays the coherence of the growth rates of money and output after removal of the
deterministic seasonal components. This figure allows us to obtaln some sense of the comovement
of the stochastic seasonality in money and output. The coherence takes on values in the range of
.8

at both the seasonal and the

business cycle frequencies.

The work of Friedman and Schwartz was responsible for a strong revival

of the much older

view (e.g., Fisher (1920)) that largely exogenous fluctuations in the nominal money stock play a
key causal role in the business cycle. It would seem quite implausible that seasonal flnctisations
in output could be driven by monetary factors. Phenomena such as the weather and Christmas

apparently play a crucial role in determining the seasonal cycle, and the money stock hardly plays a
central part in determining these events (one would hardly wish to malntaln that a capriciousPaul
Volcker conducts monetary experiments at the seasonal frequencies). Rather, the fourth quarter
peak in output seems most plausibly attributable to the impulse to real spending associated with
Christmas. In this sense, we have for the seasonal cycle an identifying restriction of a sort unavail-

associatedwith the conventionalbusiness cycle? We are of two minds on this issue. Applying the
principle of parsimony setup by Friedman and Schwartz (1963b) themselves suggests an answer in
the affirmative. After finding much less evidence of an independent causal role for money in the
"minor" business cycle movements than in the "major " ones. Friedman and Schwartz write, "If
money plays an independent role in major movements, is it likely

to

be almost passive in minor

movements? The minor movements can be interpreted as less virulent members of the same species
as the major movements. Is not a common explanation for both more appealing than separate
explanations?"
On the other hand, one might take the position that two different mechanisms are operative
in generating the observed correlations,at least one of them having a causal role for money. The
dilemma is well summarized by Minsky's (1963) comment on Friedman and Schwartz: "It seems
to me that Friedman and Schwartz really have to choosebetween accepting a dual theory in which
major fluctuations are something different from minor fluctuatious or, if they insist on a theory
that covers both major and minor cycles, they can accept a view that factors other than narrowly
monetary phenomena are important in generatiug both types of cycles."
Imposing the requirement that the same mechanism explains both the seasonaland the business
cycle correlation between money and output presents a challenge

to monetarist

models such as

those of Lucas (1972,1973,1977). In those models, money has real effects due to misperceptions,
and the money—output correlationholds for unanticipated but not anticipated money. The seasonal
movements of money and output are largely anticipated, so the high seasonal correlation between
money and output cannot reflect the misperceptions mechanismthat Lucas models. Application
of the principle of parsimony would then suggest that money is endogenous rather than causal

with respect to the business cycle as well as the seasonal cycle. Of course, it is certalnly possible to construct models in which money responds endogenously to seasonal fluctuations but is an
exogenous cause of business cycle fluctuations. Nonetheless, we find the similar comovement of
money and output at the two sets of frequencies at the very least suggestive of the endogenous
money phenomenon discussed by Tobin (1970), King and Plosser (1984), Barro (1987), and others.

E. Prices and Output
The key stylized fact about the price level and real output is that the fluctuations in output
are much greater in magnitude than those in prices — prices appear "sticky." This characterization
of the relation between prices and output also holds at the seasonal frequencies. From Table 1 we
see that the seasonal variation in prices is small relative to the seasonal variation in output (.17 vs
18

5.06). The non-seasonal variation is also smaller (.95 versus 1.91), although not as markedly.
At first blush, it might appear that one can explain the near constancy of nominal prices over
the seasons by an arbitrage argument along the lines of Roll (1972). Most goods, if not strictly
classified as durables, have an important durable component (or, perhaps more to the point, are
storable if not durable). Arbitrage, this argument goes, then implies that anticipated movements
in the prices of these goods cannot be large - if prices were expected to be very much higher in
December than in Angust, rational consumers would shift their purchases of Christmas gifts to
an earlier date. This argument falls apart, however, if consumers can hold a nominal asset whose

return varies one for one with the numinal price level (Fisher (1930)). Letting p be the nominal
price of the durable at t, the correct arbitrage condition is

at time t, net

The absenceof seasonality in prices, as well as in nominal interest rates, must surely in large

part reflect

money supply phenomena. We have argued above

that the seasonal fluctuations in out-

put are essentiallyexogenous, and these shifts in output impact on real money demand. Under this
scenario, the banking system (including the monetary authority) responds by letting the nominal
money supply increase just enough so that the money market clears without any changes in the
price level or nominal intecest rates.
A number of real (rather than nominal) factors have recently been stressed in the literature
with regard to price behavior over the business cycle.32 These primarily concern the behavior of
price relative to marginal cost, and they are potentially important in understanding the seasonal
behavior of prices in the retail sector, where it appears likely that marginal cost must be high
in the peak season. One argument (Stiglitz (1984), Bils (1987)) is that as the level of demand
rises, so does the elasticity of demand, resulting in a countercyclicalratio of price to marginal
cost. A second example is that of Rotemberg and Summers (1988), in which firms are not able to
practice peak load pricing because customers would feel taken advantage of in high demand states.
The Rotemberg and Summers story seems particularly applicableto the seasonal predicament of

V. Conclusion
The resnits presented above establish a new set of stylized facts abont macroeconomic fluctuations. The two crucial points are that seasonal fluctuations are a dominant source of short
term variation in economic activity and that seasonalfluctuations display qualitatively many of the
same cbaracteristics as business cycle fluctuations. Both facts should be challenging
aiming at a deeper understanding of macroeconomic fluctuations.

The similarity of the seasonal cycle and the business cycle presents a challenge because, to
paraphrase Lucas (1977), "it suggests the possibility of a unified explanation" of both business
cycles and seasonal cycles. By trying to understand precisely why the seasonal and the cunventional
business cycle are so similar we snay be able to shed considerablelight on all aggregate fluctuations.

Perhaps the must important reason for focussing on the seasonal cycle in economic activity
is that there are "identifyingrestrictions" availablefor seasonal fluctuations that are not available
for conventionalbusiness cycle fluctuations. We have attempted to exploit these restrictions above
to provide new evidence on the validity of competing explanations of aggregate fluctuations. The
knowledge that Christmas provides an exogenous impulse to real spending allows us to identify an
important example of endogenous money, and the knowledge that seasonal fluctuations are anticipated casts doubt on the view that the correlation between money and output at business cycle
frequencies reflects a causal effect from money to output. We have noted that the high coincidence
of production and sales at seasonal frequencies is even more problematic for production smoothing
models than the correspondingobservationsat business cycle frequencies because seasonal fluctuations are anticipated and transitory. Furthermore,we have argued that this suggests that marginal
cost does not rise rapidly with output. The large expansion in output in the demand-drivenfourth

quarter,without much increase in hours of work, prices or interest rates, suggests that aggregate
supply is relatively elastic, at least over short periods, and that labor hoarding in the presence of
demand fluctuations is perhaps the dominant cause of procyclicalproductivity.
A strung potential inference that one might be tempted to draw from the observationsreported

in this paper is that the key stylized facts of the conventionalbusiness cycle — the tendencyfor output to be produced at the last minute (the absence uf "production smoothing"), the prucyclicality
of labor productivity, the cumovement of money and output, and the fallure of prices
as much variation as quantities

—

to exhibit

may have little to do with unanticipated "shocks." Perhaps the
20

implicationis that the stylized facts we have stressed are the result of propagationmechanisms that
may not he fundamentallydifferent with respect to anticipated versus unanticipated shocks. Thus,
while the impulses driving the conventional business cycle may, because of their stochastic nature,
not be directly comparable to those driving the seasonal cycle, it may not be entirely surprising
that a number of the most readily observed responses are strikingly similar in the two cases.

Appendix: Sources of Seasonally Unadjusted Data
There are three government agencies that collect, process, and publish most of the major
macroeconomic time series. The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) bears responsibility for interest
rates, industrial production, and monetary aggregates. The Bureao of Labor Statistics (BLS) has
responsibility for consumer and wholesale prices, employment, and unemployment. The Bureau of
Economic .knalysis of the Department of Commerce (BEA) constructs the National Income and
Product Accounts (NIPA) using data collected by the Bureau of the Census. The FRB and BLS
collect and publish both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted data. BEA publishes only a limited
number of unadjusted series, and it publishes these only irregularly.
The seasonally unadjusted data produced by the FRB are published in complete detail in its
regular statistical releases. Some of these unadjusted data are also available in the Federal Reserve
Bulletin or in various books.33 All of the data are available on tape by request from the FRB. The
unadjusted data produced by BLS are published in its statistical releases, in the Monthly Labor
Review, and in a few cases in the Federal Reserve Bulletin. Again, they are also available on tape
from BLS. Some of the series from FRB and BLS are available on an unadjusted basis from online data retrieval services such as Citibase, Wharton Econometric ForecastingAssociates,or Data
Resources Incorporated.

Seasonallyunadjusted for the NIPA are more difficult to obtain. BEA never publishes any real,
seasonally unadjusted series. The reason is the order in which BEA produces its real, seasonally
adjusted series. BEA starts with several hundbod highly disaggregated nominal quantity series
that add up to nominal GNP. It obtains from BLS price indices corresponding to each of these
quantities. BEA then seasonally adjusts all the quantity series and all the price indices, deflates all
the seasonally adjusted quantity series by the seasonally adjusted price indices, and then aggregates
to produce a real, seasonally adjusted value for GNP. BEA also aggregates all the seasonaliy
adjusted nominal quantity series, which produces a value for seasonally adjosted nominal GNP.
From these two series, BEA can prodoce a seasonally adjusted implicit deflator. Given these
procedures for calculating seasonally adjosted series, it is a time consuming task to recover the
underlyingseasonally unadjusted data or to compute a seasonally unadjusted implicit deflator.
Fortunately, BRA does compute and publish seasonally unadjusted nominal quantity series for
GNP and most ofits major components. It is therefore possible to create real seasonally unadjusted
NIPA series by using one of two procedures. The first is to divide the nominal quantity series by
a seasonally unadjusted price index such as the Consumer Price Index. This is the procedure we
employ above, as well the one employed in Sargent (1976) and Miron (1986). A second procedure
is to multiply the real, seasonally adjusted series by the ratio of the nominal unadjusted series to
the nominal adjusted series; this is the procedure employed in Miron and Zeldes (1988), Reagan

a See, for example,

The Industrial ProductionBook, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.
25

and Sheehan (1985), and West (1986). So long as there is not much seasonality in prices, which
appears to he the case, this second procedure should provide a good approximatiou to the first
procedure. It is advisable and/or necessary to use the second procedure if there are not appropriate
price indices available.35
The BEA publishes the seasonally unadjusted nominal quantity data on the major subcomponents of GNP in the Survey of Current Business. The quarterly numbers fur each year appear
on
irregularly but approximately annually, usually in the July issue. The data are also available
floppy disk from the authors.

Since standard seasonal adiostmentprocedar are apprnximasely equivalent to applying two sided filters, they
alter the autocorreiation stractare of theseries. Series that have been "reseasonalized" by this second proced are
may therefore have distorted aatocorrelatinn stractures.
Mirsn and Zeldes (tsfls), Reagan and Sheehan, and West (1985) use the second procedare for precisely this
reason. The accounting intricacies involved in calculating an inventory series make it difficult to know what
price index is an appropriate deflator.
