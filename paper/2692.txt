Proponents argue that forgiveness not only serves the interest of debtor
countries, but that it also would benefit the banks.

High debt levels, it

is claimed, bring about low incentives to adjust to the debt overhang.

Low incentives to adjust lead in turn to a low capacity to service debt.
If creditors were to voluntarily reduce the debt's face value they would
promote adjustment.

The resulting greater capacity to service debt would

more than compensate them for any initial losses (see Sachs (1988) for the
original argument).

Two types of adjustment bear on the issue of debt relief:
macroeconomic policies in general and the debtor country's investment
level in particular.

dabt.

In other cases forgiveness may or may not serve the interest of creditors.
When it is in the collective interest of creditors to provide debt
reduction, however, the prospects for forgiveness may hinge on the degree
of cooperation among them.

The paper is structured as follows.

In the next section

I

describe

the debtor's repayment behavior as a function of its economic performance.

Full repayment takes place as long as revenue raised by a tax on random
output suffices to cover debt service without the tax rate exceeding a
feasible maximal level.

In other cases the tax rate ceiling determines

repayment, which equals tax revenue.

In Section III I derive a formula

for the valuation of these repayments on international financial markets,
and use it to determine the value of debt on secondary markets as well as
the secondary market price and discount.

This information is used in

Section IV to evaluate the effect on prices of a facility that purchases
debt on secondary markets in order to forgive

it.

It is shown that the

resulting price increases can be substantial even when investment does not
change.

-3-

I explore the relationship between debt and investment in Section V.

This relationship is shown to depend on the degree of capital mobility and
attitudes toward risk.

In the absence of international capital flows and

high risk aversion in the debtor country a larger debt is associated with
more investment.

In all other cases larger debts imply lower investment,

and there may exist multiple equilibria that differ in investment levels.
With multiple equilibria small changes in debt may bring about sharp
investment responses, because the economy may jump from one equilibrium to
another.

Section VI deals with welfare implications of debt reduction. I show
that debtors gain from debt reduction.

Gains by creditors are particularly likely

if multiple equilibria exist and the debtor country is trapped in a low
investment equilibrium. In this case debt reduction may force a switch to
a Pareto-superior high investment equilibrium.

This analysis identifies

circumstances in which cooperating creditors would provide voluntary debt
relief.

In Section VII I consider the scope for debt reduction in the absence
of cooperation. For this purpose I formulate a non-cooperative game in

non-cooperative actions yield voluntary debt reductions if the inital debt

In the presence of multiple investment equilibria

the solution set of the non-cooperative game may contain an

Sone policy implications of these results are discussed in the closing
section.

discussed in Section VIII.

III.

Debt Valuation1

In this section I discuss the valuation of debt on secondary markets.
I assume that these markets are part of the international financial system

and that debt repayments (3) are too small to affect state-contingent
marginal valuations in this system.

For simpliciy let the marginal

valuations be the same in all states, and let
on safe loans.

Then every uncertain future stream of payments is valued

at its discounted expected value.

the smaller the set of states in which debt is fully repaid and the lower

results from the fact that total payments in these states do not change
with the level of debt; see Figure

1).

In terms of (7) higher debt levels

reduce the probability of full repayment as well as the conditional
expected repayment share in states of partial repayment.

IV.

Price Effects of Debt Reduction

There exist several programs of debt forgiveness (see, for example,
Clime (1987)).

Some of them, such as Kenen's (1983), propose to establish

an international facility that will buy debt on secondary markets and
forgive it (see Corden (l988a) for a review).

As pointed out by Dooley

(1988), existing market discounts cannot be used to assess the cost of

debt forgiveness, because the anticipation of forgiveness raises market
prices.

My model suggests that indeed the lower the outstanding debt the

higher its price on the secondary market.

Rational expectaions imply that

in equilibrium the purchase price equals the post-purchase price on the
secondary market.

For suppose it is higher.

Then every remaining holder

of debt wants to sell for a somewhat lower price.

And if it is lower, an

owner of a unit of debt prefers to sell it after the reduction of debt.
For these reasons (6) or (7) can be used to calculate the purchase price
for an international facility that intends to forgive debt.

In this

a sufficiently high degree of debt forgiveness by an

international facility that buys debt on the secondary market will bring
about huge capital gains to the creditors with relatively little debt
relief to the debtor.

All this assumes constant investment.

As I show

below, however, the response of investment to debt reduction has important
effects on secondary market values.

V.

Investment

I deal in this section with the effects of debt on investment.

This

analysis is of interest in its own right, but it also provides an
essential ingredient in the following evaluation of the case for voluntary
debt reduction. At this stage it is sufficient to observe that (5)
implies that debt reduction does not help the creditors if it depresses
investment or raises it only slightly (because the value of debt increases
in both debt and investment). For this reason voluntary debt reduction
requires a sufficiently strong investment stimulus.

Naturally, in a

broader contex of adjustment there exist additional channels of influence.
In this study, however, I deal only with investment.

order to deal with these toncernes we need to fill in additional

Higher investment levels lead to higher supply prices of real equities,

as

If we were to draw the supply price as a function

of the stock of real equities rather than the investment level, it would
represent a regular supply curve.

However,

since the stock of real

equities increases with investment I refer to the plott of

in the

firgure as a supply curve.

In order to determine the level of investment we also need a demand
curve.

The nature of this curve dependa on institutions, the distribution

of the productivity shock, preferences, as well as additional features.
In particular, it depends on the degree of international capital mobility
allowed by the debtor country.

I will deal with two extreme cases; free

capital mobility and a binding quantative restriction on capital flows.

The first and third equilibrium are stable under the usual adjustment
process while the second is not.

Inspection of Figures 3 and 4 and the

fact that the demand curve shifts up when debt declines imply:

Proposition 1:

In the presence of free capital mobility debt reduction

stimulates investment at stable equilibria with positive investment.

First, observe that there exists a unique equilibrium for sufficiently low
debt levels as long as the supply price at zero investment is below the

Second,

equilibrium, which hurts the creditors and the debtor (see the following
section). Nevertheless, no competitive forces ensure a switch to a better
equilibrium. When a single financial investor calculates the benefits of

Higher equity

Higher investment, in turn, reduces tax

rates in states of full repayment, thereby justifying the expected high

This mechanism is responsible

for the multiplicity of

In

The intiution behind this result can be explains as follows. An increase
in debt reduces the return to equity in every state with full repayment.
This generates two effects; an income and a rate of return effect.

The

income effect stems from the fact that given equity holdings future income

Investment affects the demand price through three channels: first period
consumption, the stock of real equities, and the rate of return on equity.
Higher investment reduces the demand price via the first two channels and
reduces it via the third channel if and only if the degree of relative
risk aversion is larger than one (see Lena).

The last condition also

ensures that the demand price increases in debt.

Hence, the demand curve

slopes downward when risk aversion is high, as in Figure 6, and debt
reduction shifts the demand curve downwards, thereby depressing
investment.

When the degree of relative riak aversion is smaller than one the
affect of investment on first period consumption and the stock of real
equities may cause the demand curve to slope downward.

In this case,

More insight can be gained by identifying links among these results.
Free capital mobility leads to a linear evaluation of equities.
Therefore, in the presence of restrictions on capital mobility one expects
low risk aversion to generate results that are closer to the case of

perfect capital mobility than high risk aversion,

which indeed happens.

except that the factor of proportionality depends on investment.

The

latter dependence disappears altogether when the elasticity of

Under these circumstances the effects of debt forgiveness on investment
are the same as under free capital mobility.

5:

For this reason we have:

If there is no international capital mobility,

the degree

of relative risk aversion is smaller than one, and the elasticity of

debt and investment is the ssme as in the case of free capital mobility.

I should like to emphasized that the similarity in results

that is pointed

out in this proposition applies not only to the response of investment to
debt but also to the possibility of multiple equilibria.

-

In this case debt reduction raises investment and the price of

equity at stable equilibria (unless the economy jumps to a different
equilibrium) and the debtor gains on account of better asset terms of
trade (see Proposition

l).

The second term is always zero, because

firms maximize net value (see (9)).

The third term describes the direct

effect of debt and investment on welfare through the rate of return, or
equivalently,

through the tax rates.

Debt reduction raises investment at

a stable equilibrium when capital moves freely.

In this case tax rates

decline in states of full repayment both as a result of lower debt service
payments and higher investment.

Consequently,

the rate of return rises

in

these state and the debtor gains.

In the absence of capital mobility only changes in the rate of return
affect the debtor's welfare, and I have shown in the previous section that
under these circumstances debt reduction increases investment at stable
equilibria if and only if the degree of relative risk aversion is smaller
than one (see Propositions 3 and 4).

Hence, when the degree of relative

risk aversion falls short of one debt reduction increases the rate of
return on equity in states of full repayment, both through the direct
effect of lower debt and the indirect investment effect on tax rates.
Consequently, the country gains.

In the absence of capital mobility and a

larger than one degree of relative risk aversion debt forgiveness reduces
investment. In this case the rate of return rises as a result of the

Therefore creditors benefit from debt

Consequently, voluntary

In view

of Proposition 3 this implies

Proposition 9:

If there is no international

capital mobility and the

degree of relative risk aversion is larger than one, creditors do not
benefit from debt reduction.

In other cases creditors may or may not benefit from debt reduction.
Take,

for example, the case in which a unique equilibrium exists for every

Therefore,

there may exist sufficiently large debt levels at which the creditors
benefit from debt reduction.

guarantee voluntary debt reduction. The point is that even under these

circumstances the market value of debt may be rising with

and even when it does not always rise with the debt's face value voluntary
debt reduction requires the inital debt to be sufficiently large.

Particularly interesting features of the debt relief problem arise
when there are multiple equilibria. Consider the situation described in

where two equilibria exist for every debt level in the range

Therefore in this case debt

In this situation debt reduction can perform the important

function of a trigger that shifts the economy to a better equilibrium.

The following section discusses

taking into account the incentives facing individual

creditors.

VII.

Equilibrium Debt Reduction

We have seen that there exist circumstances in which the market value
of debt V[D,I(D)J

rises with its face value; other circumstances in

- 32

which it rises for low face values

-

and declines for high face values;

and

that it can in fact drop discontinuousely. Whenever market value rises
with face value creditors lose from debt reduction, unless there is more
than one investment equilibrium and debt reduction switches the economy
froa a low to a high investment equilibrium. In the latter case--as well
as in the case in which the face value of debt falls

into a range in which

market value declines with face value- -creditors are interested to provide
debt relief.

This, however, is a collective interest.

A

frequent

argument states that even when debt reduction serves the collective
incarest of creditors, a single creditor stands to gain more by not
participating in a relief program. Because once debt is forgiven by
others,

he fully enjoys higher repayments per unit debt without diluting

the face value of his holdings.

I show that in the single equilibrium

case this argument has no justification; a single creditor can benefit
from a voluntary reduction of his claims.

It may, however, apply in the

presence of multiple equilibria.

In order to examine this issue I formulate the relief decision as a
noncooperative game among creditors. For simplicity I only discuss
symmetric games and their corresponding symmetric equilibria (i.e. ,games
in which every creditor owns the same face value of debt).

First,

consider the case in which a single investment equilibrium exists for
every level of debt (i.e.,

Proposition

13:

37

-

If there exist multiple investment equilibria for a given

debt level then an equilibrium with debt reduction may coexist with an
equilibrium without debt reduction.

Ihis result shows that debt reduction is not guaranteed even when it is an
equilibrium phenomenon, because it may coexist with an equilibrium in
which there is no debt reduction. Which one emerges depends on
expectations.

If creditors believe that others will forgive debt, they

also chose to forgive and debt reduction obtains.

If, on the other hand,

creditors believe that others will not forgive, they also chose not to
forgive and no debt reduction takes place.

This happens only when the

economy is trapped in a low investment equilibrium. It represents a clear
instance in which cooperation has a high return.

VIII.

Conclusions

My results show that the desirability and likelihood of voluntary
debt reduction depend on circumstances. Creditors benefit from a
write-down of debt in some circumstances and lose in others.

Theory helps

to identify important features of those circumstances. But once those
features are known, there is no substitute for a careful examination of
their applicability to toncrete countries.
