this analysis is a theory of a proprietary fiscal authority whose
objective is to extract rents for the political establishment,
the proprietor of sovereign power.
[North (1981) refers to the
of

maximizing political rents as "predatory", but it is
not clear why this pejorative term is more warranted in

describing the proprietor of sovereign power than in referring to
the activities of self—interested proprietors of private
property.)

Examples of groups that could constitute the political
establishment include the professional politicians, the
bureaucrats, the royal court, the members and/or supporters of
the ruling party, the military, or the clients of any of these

political establishment is subject to change, it is at any point
in time well defined. The theory also assumes that the fiscal
authority is an efficient maximizer of the self interest of the
political establishment.1 Accordingly, tax and spending policies
in this theory differ a little or a lot from the policies that
would maximize the welfare of the representative citizen, not
because

the fiscal authority is benevolent or selfish, wise or
foolish, knowledgeable or ignorant, but rather, as with any self—
interested proprietary activity, because of the nature of the
constraints, which in this case are both economic and political,
that the fiscal authority faces.
In attempting to maximize political rents —— or, more
precisely, the sum of current and expected future political rents
—— the proprietary fistal
authority is subject to the basic
economic constraint that political rents are limited by the

trade—off between increases in the share of output that goes to
political rents and the disincentive effect of increases in the
rental share on the tax base. The tiscal authority must take
account of the disincentive effects both of high expected tax
rates and of niggardly provision of productive public services.
If the maximization of political rents were subject only to
this economic incentive constraint, the fiscal authority would
set the tax rate at the peak of the Latter curve and would devote
only a fraction of its revenues to providing productive public
services.

Alesina (1988), alternate in power according to a stationary

stochastic process and that cooperate, at least implicitly, in
extracting and sharing political rents. It it exists, political
competition faces the fiscal authority with a choice between, on
the one hand, tax and spending policies that increase political
rents but decrease both the expected welfare ot the
representative citizen and the survival probability of the
existing political establishment and, on the Other hand, tax and
spending policies thatsacrifice political rents in order to

establishment and its likelihood of being able to receive
political rents in the future.2 A central result ot the analysis
is that, if the political system is sufficiently stable (in a way
defined more precisely below), then a positive amount of
political competition induces an equilibrium in which the
proprietary fiscal authority sets a lower tax rate than at the
peak of the Laffer curve and, despite reduced revenues, spends
more on productive public services.
The requirement of time consistency, if it is a binding
constraint, influences the equilibrium policy in the opposite
direction. The time—consistency constraint reflects the
inability of the fiscal authority to use irrevocable commitments
to control its own future actions, including its future choice ot
the tax rate. This inability to make commitments is a corollary
of the sovereign's ability to act without being answerable to a
higher legal authority, the power from which the fiscal
authority's power to tax and to set the tax rate derives.

Without irrevocable commitments, an expectation about future
policy can be rational, and an announcement about future policy
can be credible, only if this expectation or announcement is time
consistent —— that is, only if the fiscal authority will not be
able to do better in the future than to validate this expectation
or announcement.

In general, a time—consistency constraint is

present context, the time—consistency requirement restricts the
equilibrium tax rate to be sufficiently high that the fiscal
authority will resist the temptation to set the actual tax rate
higher than this expected rate. The time—consistency requirement
thus limits the potential effect of political competition on the
equilibrium tax rate. Political competition can lower the
equilibrium tax rate or'.ly until the time—consistency constraint
becomes binding.

—5—
Recent theories —— see, for example, Grossman & Van Huyck
(1986, 1988) and Grossman (1988) —— have emphasized the role of
reputational considerations in supporting time—consistent
In a reputational model, the implication of the
time—consistency restriction for equilibrium policy depends in
large part on the rate at which the policymaker discounts the
future.
For example, in the present context, if the fiscal
authority is sufficiently concerned about future political rents,
then reputation substitutes fully for the inability to make
irrevocable commitments and the time—consistency constraint does
not bind.

fiscal authority is greatly concerned about the effects ot its
current policies on its potential for extracting political rents
in the future.
In equilibrium, the survival probability depends
in turn on the stability of the political system.
Accordingly,
another central result of the analysis is that the beneficial

effect of political competition increases with more high
political stability.

preannounced tax rates, we use a simplified version of models of
expectations developed in previous analyses of reputational
for monetary and fiscal policy —— see, for example,

equilibria

irrationality or from a breakdown in the process by which the

individuals who compose the fiscal authority reach their
decisions. Either infirmity, however uncommonly it occurs, is
intrinsic and irreversible.
Knowing this pattern of fiscal authority behavior, producers,
when dealing with a specific fiscal authority, attach
probability l—, which equals approximately unity, to rational
behavior as long as this fiscal authority has always honored its

preannounced tax rate in the past.
If, alternatively,
this fiscal
authority has ever set the tax rate equal to unity, producers
would expect such confiscatory behavior in the future. In this
case, which occurs with frequency
or approximately zero,
E,
future marketable output, and hence potential political rents,
would be zero. [We can easily extend this analysis to allow
producers to ignore an isolated instance of confiscatory taxation
or to forget distant past behavior.

(1988), memory is a stochastic process.]
Given that the fiscal authority at date t has a reputation
for honoring its preannounced tax rate, these assumptions about

Reputational Equilibrium

Given that producers base their expectation about the fiscal
authority's tax policy on the fiscal authority's current and past
record of honoring preannounced tax rates, a rational fiscal
authority considers how its current tax rate affects its
reputation for honoring its preannouncements and how its
reputation affects its ability to extract political rents in the
future.
Specifically, taking account of its reputation for
rational behavior, the proprietary fiscal authority's problem at
date t is to choose the constant announced and actual tax rate

Equation (24) like equation (11) above, says that the optimal
proprietary policy equates the expected marginal revenue from
taxation to the marginal cost of the tax rate in reducing the
probability of surviving to collect future political rents, except
that the marginal revenue from taxation and the marginal cost of
taxation now depend on the amount of public services as well as on
the tax rate itself.
Equation (25) says that the optimal

These first—order conditions imply that the ettects of the

g and x also satisfy equations (20) and (22). Even if the time

The

Summary

The analysis, as summarized by Figure 1, shows that, if the
political system is sufficiently stable, a more competitive
political system is better up to a point. As long as the time—
consistency constraint is not binding, more political competition,
like more political stability, implies a lower tax rate and more
spending on productive public services. In this case,

he

proprietary fiscal authority, in order to enhance the survival
probability of the political establishment, behaves more like a
hypothetically benevolent fiscal authority.
Political competition, however, can lower the equilibrium tax
rate and increase the equilibrium spending on productive public
services only until the time—consistency constraint becomes
binding. Consequently, the beneficial effect of political
competition increases with the stability of the political
system. Regardless of the amount of political competition, a
political system that is insufficiently stable can cause the
fiscal authority to be trapped on the wrong side of the Latfer
curve and to provide little in the way of productive public
services.
Why then, as we asked in the introduction, have tax and
spending policies in some of the modern democracies apparently
been, if not welfare maximizing, at least more benevolent than in

—

28 —

the typical kieptocracy?

The theory of proprietary public finance
developed here suggests that the fiscal authorities in these
modern democracies are riot necessarily relatively uninterested in
maximizing political rents or relatively wise or knowledgable.
Instead, the theory suggests not that they do not share the
objectives of other kieptocrats, but rather that they face

economic and political constraints that induce them to follow
policies that are closer to the policies of a hypothetically
benevolent fiscal authority. The theory suggests, specifically,
that the essential characteristic of these modern democracies is
that their political systems combine a high degree of political
stability with a positive amount of effective political

competition.

The analysis abstracts from the process of forming the

political rents. We implicitly assume that the process by
