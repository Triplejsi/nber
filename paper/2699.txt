A STRATEGIC ALTROISM MODEL

IN

WHICH RICARDIAN EQUIVALENCE DOES NOT HOLD

ABSTRACT

This article demonstrates that Ricardian Equivalence does not
necessarily hold in

models with altruistic transfers once one takes into

account the strategic behavior of recipients as well as donors. To influence
the final allocation of consumption in altruistic settings, potential
recipients can threaten to refuse as well as accept transfers.

We apply

the Extended Nash Bargaining Solution to the problem

of an

altruistic parent and a possibly altruistic child. The parent and child
first choose a threat point noncooperatively; this threat point then
influences the final allocation of consumption through the standard Nash
Bargaining Solution, While the potential recipient can refuse transfers from
the potential donor, he cannot refuse transfers from the government. When
the golrernrnenr redistributes between the parent and child, it changes their
endowments and the equilibrium threats,

and thus the final allocation of

onsuaption.
The feature of the cooperative model presented here that leads to the
failure of Ricardian Equivalence may be characteristic of a wider class of
cooperative and noncooperative altruism models.

This feature is that non-

interior strategic postures underlie interior transfer behavior and that
these non-interior strategic postures are altered by government
redistribution.

Introduction
It is now 15 yesrs since Robert Barro (1974) wrote his ingenious article

showing how love of children (intergenerational

altruism) can economically

link current and future generations and thereby neutralize intergenerational
redistributionby the government (Ricardian Equivalence).

During this time

the Barro model, despite its critics, has taken its place wIth the Keynesian
and Life Cycle models aa a principal paradigm of saving and growth.

Several

critics have pointed out reasons why the requirement for Ricardian Equivalence

of interior transfers may not be satisfied (e.g., Barro, 1974; Drazen, 1978;
L.aitner.

l979a, 1979b, 1988 and Feidstein,

1988).

Others (Kotlikoff, 1983 and

Sernheim and Bagweil. 1984) have cast doubt on the model by showing how

neutralized.

None of the critics has, however, questionedwhether Ricardian
quivalence necessarily follows from the basic elements in Barro'a study.
This article does lust that.

It examines the strategic game between an

altruistic parent and a possibly altruiatic child and shows, under the

Extended Nash Bargaining Solution1, that Ricardian Equivalence will almost
never hold.

The Extended Nash Bargaining Solution is simply the standard Nash

Bargaining Solution extended to permit its threat (disagreement) point to be
determined endogenously as an equilibrium of a noncooperative
strategy selection.

This noncooperative

game of threat—

game is played prior to the Nash

bargaining game, and the equilibrium threats in our setting turn out to be the

—2—

players'

initial endowments.

When the government redistributes, it changes

each player's endowment and, therefore, the equilibrium of the threat game.
Since the bargaining solution depends on the equilibrium of the threat game,

government redistribution,

in general, changes the outcome of the bargaining

game.
Barro does not make explicit the game he models between an altruistic

parent and child, but in his formulation the child appears to be quite passive
and simply takes whatever transfer is given.

There is no scope for the child

to manipulate the parent by threatening to refuse transfers that are below a
specified

level and\or by threatening to transfer funds to the parent if the

parent is not sufficiently generous.

Stated differently, there is no scope

The apparent restrictions on the actions of children in the

Barro model become more apparent if parents not only love (are altruistic with
respect to) their children, but children love (are altruistic with respect to)
their parents.

While parents and children may care for each other, they are

unlikely to agree on the exact net amount to be transferred between them.

For

families with reciprocal altruism (presumably most families) the problem than
is one of competing altruism in which parents may be trying to transfer to

their children at the same time that the chLldren are trying to transfer to
their parents.

In such a setting the assumption that each player simply

accepts whatever is offered seems unrealistic.

Individuals seem equally

empowered both to make and to refuse gifts.2

Private transfers may. however, more than fully offset government

As an example, if the government redistributes

from the

solution will move from point D to a point between A and C.

The solution must

lie to the left of C because to the right of C the parent is made worse off

recipient of private transfers, but not so much as to move the endowment

point

into the region between A and B, the private response will more than offset
the government policy.

Thus, if the government takes sway too much of the net

transferee's bargaining leverage, the net transferee will definitely end up
worse off.

There can be isolated instances where the government's transfer is
exactly offset; here Ricardian Equivalence holds.

Also in the case A—B the

unique Pareto—optimal allocation is the solution in the second stage no matter
what transfers occur; hence, for this case Ricardian Equivalence holds.

Extended Nash Bsrpaininz Solution to the Noncooperative

Equilibrium

In contrast to the Extended Nash Solution, the noncooperative equilibrium
in this same static framework does exhibit Ricardian Equivalence.5

In the

noncooperative equilibrium each player takes the other player's maximum offer
and acceptance as given and chooses his best response.

In terms of Figure 1

if the endowment point lies between points A and B, the only noncooperative

equilibrium is the same as the cooperative solution, resulting in each player

consuming his endowment.

In this region the issue of Ricardian Equivalence

does not arise as there are no transfers before or after the government's

describes all the equilibria: The parent offers to transfer just enough funds

to the child to move the allocation to the parent's bliss point A and the
parent accepts nothing.

The child offers nothing and accepts the amount of

the parent's offer (or more).

The same reasoning indicates that if the

endowment point lies to the right of point B, all the noncooperative

equilibria require the child to transfer an amount sufficient to move the
allocation to point B and for the parent to accept this transfer,

For example, if the endowment lies to the left of point A, why doesn't the

parent simply tell the child "take it or leave it," and why
simply take it.

One answer is that since the child knows the parent's

altruistic utility,

the child calls the parent's bluff.

This assumes the

parent has no last—mover advantage (but we have been abstracting from the fine
details of the bargaining process throughout; see Section V).

Another answer may be that the child cares about the bargaining procea
as well as the outcome.

If the child feels he is being toLd tek.e it or

The

child may also feel a loss of pride in accepting a transfer, so the transfer
may need to be conveyed to the child in a manner that preserves the child's
pride.

Maintenance

of the child's pride may require the parent to pursue

cooperative bargaining.

In the cooperative game modeled here the parent and

child know 1) that they are going to meet and try to work out a transfer

A usual argument favoring cooperative rules (i.e.

that

agreements are possible) is the objective of making
non—optimal outcomes.

In the model presented here, however, the

noncooperativeequilibria happen to be Pareto optimal, so Pareto improvementE
do not justify the cooperative solution.

However, extensions of the model

lead to cases in which the noncooperative

equilibrium is not Pareto optimal.

As a consequence, the noncooperative equilibrium involves too

One way to test empirically the cooperative model against the

noncooperativemodel is to determine whether the distribution of consumption
among family members who are partiea to net transfers depends on the
distribution of initial resources among these members,
