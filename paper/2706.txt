voters have to choose between two polarized candidates; mid-term elections
are used to counterbalance the President's policies by strenghtening the
opposition in Congress. Since presidents of different parties are associated
with different economic policies, our model predicts a (spurious) correlation
between the state of the economy and elections. The predictions of our model
are in sharp contrast with those of traditional retrospective voting models
in which voters simply reward the incumbent if the economy is doing well

Since voters have single peaked preferences,

there exists s cutpoint in the

his view. For empirical evidence in European countries see Alt (1985)

5Note that labor contracts may last one, or even two years; thus even though
some elections may not be very uncertain say two or three months before
November, the electoral uncertainty relevant to these economic decisions is
present say 12 or even 18 months before the election.
6Split-ticket voting undoubtedly also responds to many other influences, such
as incumbency advantage and ethnic preference.

related context.
"This simplification eliminates the issue of time inconsistency of optimal
monetary policy in rational expectations models pointed out by Kydland and
Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983). The time inconsistency arises
if the unexpected inflation term enters the utility functions of the two
parties.
By not including output in the objective functions such a term does
not appear.
Alesina (1987, 1988a) and Alesina and Sachs (1988) show
extensivelyhow to deal with this problem in two-party models.

period of any administration.
'6Like Fair (1987), we report results based on the latest revisions of the
data, which in the case of GNP, have been quite substantial.
However, such a
choice is problematic.
Kramer (1979) argues that one should model voters as
basing their decisions not on changes in their total income but on changes in
income that they attribute to governmental activity. However, one may argue
that voters' assessments reflect the "real" economy rather than the
"unrevised"
announcements
made by the government in the period before
election.
We have checked our analysis with respect to CNP data by using the
CITIBASE series prior to the 1986 revisions.
The results from the oldec
series are somewhat more favorable to the argument advanced in this
paper.

"We do not intlude Presidential voting in this paper.
We completely agree
with Fair (1978), who, citing work by Lepper (1974), argues that it was
unreasonable for Kramer (1971) to have estimated a model in which
Presidential and House elections were considered in a single model with
constrained coefficients.
'80f course, it might well make sense, in the spirit of Fair's research, to
include DEPR in a short-term (Truman announced his withdrawal on March 12,
1952 and Johnson on March 30, 1968) forecasting model.

congruent with Lepper's (1974) finding that incumbents lose votes when either
unemployment or inflation is high.

221n order to gain degrems of freedom, observations from the interwar period
could be used. In this case, however, one has to make more and more heroic
assumptions about the stability of the politico-economic environment and thus
about the stability of coefficients.
In addition, if one excludes the
observations affected by the two World Wars and by the Great Depression,
there are very few useful observations can be obtained for years prior to
1950 in this century.
23For the House, the F-test, which is equivalent to a two-tailed t-test here,
is not significant whereas the one-tailed t-test on the lagged variable is.
