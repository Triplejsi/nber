For

data in a given year (at least 75 percent of all potential readings
present),

we computed annual hourly arithmetic averages of carbon

monoxide,

sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide, annual arithmetic averages

of daily maximums of ozone concentrations,

and annual weekly arithmetic

averages of lead and particulate concentrations.

These computations were

made for the examination year and for each of the three previous years.
Then six pollutant-specificannual averages for each subject were obtained
as simple averages of the monitor averages.

Finally,

the pollutant-

specific four—year average for the individual was calculated as a simple
average of the four annual averages.

If data were missing for one or two

years, a three— or two—year average was computed.

If an annual average was

available for a single year alone, that figure was used.

of 3.9 and 2.9, respectively.11 The sulfur dioxide coefficients are also
positive in the diastolic and systolic models, with t values of 2.3 and
2.9.

The remaining air pollution variables are negatively related to blood
pressure in at least one of the blood pressure specifications and have
generally low t statistics.

In order to allow for more than one pollution

variable in a blood pressure model consider first diastolic blood pressure
regressions that include the independent variables of table 3 with the
pollution variables added one at a time to form the following five pollution variable combinations: carbon monoxide (repeated from table 3); carbon
monoxide and sulfur dioxide; carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and total
suspended particulates; these three pollutants plus ozone; and these four
pollutants plus nitrogen dioxide.12 The carbon monoxide regression coefficients and t values from these models are: .62, 3.9; .63, 3.5; .64, 3.5;
.84, 4.1 and 1.75, 4.6.

1Ahmad and Ahmad (1980) provide two possible explanations for the asso-

ciation between carbon monoxide exposure and hypertension.
these is that "chronic stimulation

The first of

of the cardiac chemoreceptor

and adrenal

glands by serotoniri could contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension"
(p.

565).

The idea here is that the human body responds to the risk of

carbon monoxide exposure by increasing blood pressure as a protective
measure.

The second explanation is that the association of carbon monoxide

with arteriosclerosismay produce higher blood pressure because a stiffening of the baroreceptor area may result in partial denervation.
2For a detailed description of NHANES II, see National Center for
Health Statistics (1981).

The exact sample size is 25,285.

Of these sub-

jects, 20,322 received the physical examination.

3problems with the blood pressure data in NHANES II have recently been
acknowledged by the National Center for Health Statistics (1986).

In their

F—2

description of trends

in blood

pressure in the United States from 1960 to

1980, it is pointed out that the large proportion of diastolic blood

pressure measures with an end digit of zero in NHANES II may be indicative
of a lack of concentration or of hearing impairment among the examining
physicians during the measurement of diastolic blood pressure.

This is

possible because the examining physicians in NHANES II were almost all
retired practitioners and because

hearing acuity diminishes with age.

Systolic blood pressure measurement was thought not to be adversely
affected by physician hearing loss or carelessness.

The end digit zero

problem characterized the latter part of the NHANES II period with blood
pressure data from five primary sampling units in particular being of
questionable quality (Coate and Fowles, 1987).

Deleting data from these

PSUs from the samples used below lowers slightly the coefficients and t

values of the carbon monoxide variables

in models reported below.

4All counties in SMSA's have census tracts.

Whether or not a county

outside an SMSA has census tracts is a local government decision.

Approximately two—thirds of the NHANES II subjects resided in counties
with census

tracts.

5Because of the large number of total suspended particulate monitors,
readings for this pollutant were never taken from monitors more than ten
miles from the population centroid of the subjects'

census tract.

Note

also that at a given monitor location data may be recorded for only a
single pollutant.

However,

Also exploratory

with these health outcome variables with the independent

variables described below yielded insignificant F statistics.
9See, for example,

Fortmann et al. (1983), Gordon and Kannel (1983),

and Pirkle et al. (1985).

Gordon and Kannel find in the Framingham data a

negative relationship between own cigarette smoking, which might be considered one form of carbon monoxide exposure,

and blood pressure.

They

attribute the finding to the lower weight of smokers, although the relationship apparently holds up in some instances after controlling for
weight.

Our regression results,

presented below, also show a negative and

significant relationship between cigarette smoking and blood pressure in

The inclusion of both

The simple correlation coefficient between these

two variables of .25 is low enought so that problems associated with multi-

collinearity do not arise when both are used as regressors.
l0Adjustments

for sample design lower t statistics because they incor-

porate a positive (in most cases) correlation among the regression disturbance terms of individuals who reside in the same primary sampling units.
Adjustments for sample design have not been carried out because the
sampling weights provided with the NHANES

II

data are not appropriate for

the various subsamples considered in this paper.
11Carbon monoxide coefficients were nearly identical to those reported
in table 3 when the diastolic and systolic blood pressure models were esti-

mated over separate samples of males and females.

For the 12-17 year olds

and 18-39 year olds carbon monoxide coefficients are positive and t values

exceed three in the case of diastolic blood pressure and one in the case of
systolic blood pressure.
12The ordering of the last three pollutants was fixed so as to maximize

the number of observations in each regression.

The carbon monoxide-sulfur

dioxide ordering was based on their statistical

significance as indicated

by the t values in table 2.

The number of observations for the six

F-S

regressions

in the order listed in the text are: 2,342; 1,975; 1,932;
Because observations with missing data are deleted,

1,582; 826.

of observations falls as pollutants are added because data completeness

requires a subject to be within twenty miles of a monitor for each pollutant included in the regression.
