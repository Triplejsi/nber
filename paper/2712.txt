THE STATES' EXPERIENCE WITH INCOME TAX INDEXING

ABSTRACT

Prior to 1985, ten states adopted some kind of indexing provisions for
their personal income tax systems.

Seven of these states subsequently

suspended their indexing laws for one or more years.

In this paper we

examine the states' experience with income tax indexing and see what
lessons can be drawn from it.

We describe the indexing statutes,

and

estimate simple econometric models of both the decisions to adopt indexing
and to renege on a promise to index.

Introduction

an income tax is based upon nominal income, then in general, the
real burden of taxation depends upon the rate of inflation. The most
When

popularly understood way in which inflation affects taxes is "bracket creep."
As nominal income

increases, the individual is pushed into brackets with

higher marginal tax rates. Hence, the proportion of income that is taxed
increases despite the fact that real income stays the same. Another effect of
inflation occurs because exemptions and the standard deduction are set in
nominal terms. Increases in the price level decrease their real value, again

increasing the effective tax rate.1
Inflation, then, leads to unlegislated increases in the real burden of the
income tax.

Aaron [1976, p.

points out that for the federal income tax,
historically these effects have been mitigated by a series of ad hoc
reductions in statutory rates. Such cuts in the federal income tax were

enacted in 1969, 1971, 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1981. An alternative to such ad
hoc arrangements is to index the tax system, i.e., to legislate a formula which
automatically removes the influence of inflation from real tax liabilities.
should it matter whether the effects of inflation are mitigated by ad

is supposed to represent a serious commitment by the government to

a given real tax schedule, i.e., a relationship between real income and real
tax burdens. Although the tax schedule might change in the future, it would
be a consequence of explicit legislative changes, and not the vagaries of the
inflation rate. Ex ante, a series of ad hoc adjustments does not provide the
same kind of certainty.2

The purpose of this paper is to examine the states' experience with
income tax indexing and see what lessons can be drawn from it.

provides a description of the relevant statutes. Section III examines the
circumstances that led some states to adopt indexing, and why some of them
subsequently reneged on their promises. Section IV concludes with a
summary, suggestions for future research, and discussion of possible
implications for federal

tax reform.

II. State Indexing Laws
This section provides summaries of the various

state indexing laws.

We

begin with descriptions of the relevant statutes, and then provide a
quantitative summary. The information was culled from various editions of
published by Commerce Clearing House; the state
income tax forms; and, in some cases, direct communication with the various

A.

The Indexing Statutes.

State tax systems differ widely with respect to the items that are
indexed, and how these items are adjusted in response to changes in the
price level. Generally, indexing statutes apply to one or more of the

standard deductions,
and the ranges over which vanishing deductions and credits are phased out.
following items: bracket widths, personal exemptions,

Before discussing the specifics of the various statutes, we should note one

brackets, standard deduction, personal exemptions, a

property tax credit and a rent credit are all included. (However, a ceiling
on the deduction for child care allowances is unindexed.) The price index
used is the Phoenix Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the fiscal year ending in
the tax year. The implied changes in bracket widths, etc., are rounded down
to the nearest $10.
One

peculiarity of the Arizona law is that the standard deduction is

over-indexed.

the standard deduction was

a maximum of $1000. The Arizona

statute indexes not only the minimum and maximum amounts, but also the
percentage rate used in the calculation. By 1985, the percentage rate was
18.3

percent, with a minimum of $917, and a maximum of $1834. When we

contacted the Arizona tax authorities to confirm our understanding of their
law, apparently no one realized what was happening. At the time of this

writing, a modification of the statute is under consideration.
California began indexing income brackets in 1978. The same law

prescribed indexing of the personal exemptions, dependent deductions and

credit beginning in 1979. The limit on capital losses, the child
care credit, and the rent credit remained unindexed. For 1978 and 1979, the
low income

adjustment factor was the California CPI minus three percent (but not less
than zero). For 1980 on, the factor was the change in the California CPI for

the

12

months ending in June of the tax year. Bracket widths are rounded

to the nearest $10, and other items to the nearest $1. This brings us to a

feature of California's law that is shared by a number of other
states--rounding errors are not carried forward. Suppose, for example, that

statute went into effect in 1978. Personal exemptions,
income brackets and the standard deduction were covered; food, fuel and
property tax credits were not. The index amount was to be set annually by
the legislature. If the legislature failed to take action, the law specified a

basis of its retroactivity. The Supreme Court of Maine ruled that the
initiative was legal, but meanwhile the legislature managed to postpone

Income Adjustment Factor" (TNIAF), a number which, when multiplied by each

taxpayers taxable income, ensures that average taxable income will grow at
the same rate as average gross income. The TNIAF is bounded below by
one. This factor was introduced to meet concerns that the 1979 law was

the real value of the tax base. (The main element
in this erosion was the fact that (unindexed) federal tax payments are
leading to a reduction in

Minnesota tax collections fell.) ii) The adjustment factor was based on the

Oregon adopted indexation in 1979 for tax years 1981 onward. Only

the

personal exemption was indexed. In 1982, the law was suspended
retroactively to 1981. Moreover, during the years 1983—1985, the personal
exemption itself was temporarily removed, and replaced by a general credit,
which was not indexed. In effect, then, indexing was removed. In 1985, the

change from an exemption to a credit was made permanent, and the credit
was indexed to the Portland CPI, beginning in 1986.
South Carolina adopted indexing in 1980, effective in 1982. Only bracket
widths were affected. However, in 1983, before 1982 taxes were paid, the

effective date was postponed to 1984 and the adjustment factor reduced to 25
percent of the CPI. For 1985, the adjustment factor used was twenty—five
percent of that in the federal tax law for bracket widths, and 100 percent
for the standard deduction and personal exemptions.

Summary.

it shows for each state the adjustment factor applied to
whatever items were indexed. Thus, for example, Arizona's figure of 16.0 for
1978-1985,

1980 means

that the

tax parameters were determined by applying a 16
percent adjustment factor to their 1979 values. For purposes of reference,
the last line records the percentage change in the U.S. CPT as a whole. An
1980

asterisk (*) indicates that indexing was promised for that year, but was then
suspended.
Table 2.1 does not do justice to

the heterogeneity of the various indexing

statutes across states; however, a tabular representation of all the provisions
would be unwieldy. In any case, if we seek to assess the impact of a
given
state's indexing statute, we must view it in the context of the rest of that
state's tax code. However, the tax codes themselves differ dramatically from
state to state, both with respect

the tax base and tax schedule. (See
Feenberg and Rosen [1986].) These considerations suggest that a sensible
characterization of the extent of indexing must embody some sort of

This phenomenon is explainable by the facts that:

a) federal income

Hence, when nominal income goes up, nominal state income

indexing and those that did not with respect to the 1982 values of a number
of important fiscal and demographic variables.4 (Data sources are

the Appendix.) The table indicates that with respect to
population, personal income per capita, general expenditures per capita, per
documented in

capita debt, and deficits per capita, the differences between indexing and
non—indexing states are not very great. The income and deficit figures are
virtually identical.

Indexing states have somewhat larger populations and per
capita government expenditures, and smaller per capita debts, but these
differences are not statistically significant.5
the other hand, the revenue structures of the indexing and
non-indexing states are quite different. First, indexing states raised 36

Are the income tax systems themselves different? As is well—known, for
complicated non-proportional tax schedules, in general there is no single

number that can characterize the entire schedule. Table 3.1 therefore
presents several different measures: the elasticity of revenues with respect

to income; and the marginal tax rates on individuals with $10,000, $20,000, and
$40,000 incomes. On average, the elasticity is higher in indexing than
non—indexing states, as are the marginal tax rates at each income level.

Of

course, the figures in Table 3.1 reflect only the status of the various

states as of 1982. They reveal little about the states' situations at the time

that indexation was adopted.

What

factors might affect this decision? In

particular, what effect might a state's tax structure have on its indexing
status?

There is no standard theoretical framework to

rely upon for

generating hypotheses on how various variables influence the indexing
decision. This is because, as Atkinson and Stiglitz [1980, Chap. 10] and

others have noted, there is no generally accepted theory of how public
sector decisions are made.
We

have found it useful to think of indexing in the context of an

informal model in which legislators seek

are

as

suggested by Fair [1982], Feldstein [1980] and others, then legislators cannot
expect to be rewarded in the relatively distant future for earlier support of
indexing.

Hence,

the legislator's choice between indexing and a series of ad

hoc reductions in the future depends upon, inter alia: i) the legislator's

discount rate and time horizon; ii) the extent to which voters in the next
election will be influenced by support for indexing; iii) the extent to which
voters in future elections will reward legislators who voted for indexing in
the past; and iv) the extent to which votes in future elections are influenced

decreases.

Thus, as a state's income tax structure becomes more progressive,7 there
are two effects that work in opposite directions. First, as progressivity
increases, so does the cost of indexation in terms of lost opportunities for

future tax reductions. This tends to reduce support for indexing. The
second effect of increased progressivity is to increase the present value of
the stream of tax reductions implicit in the indexing law. This tends to
increase support for indexing. In short, the tradeoffs inherent in the
are made

more dramatic when

progressivity increases.
Whether this tends to increase or decrease the probability of indexing cannot

Another variable that might affect the indexation decision is

the

importance of the personal income tax in the state's revenue system.
Suppose that the costs to legislators of enacting a tax indexing statute do
not vary proportionately with

the size of the income tax. In particular, there

costs in terms of time spent organizing a coalition, putting the
statute through the legislative process, etc. If such is the case, then it
would be less worthwhile to enact an indexing statute when the income tax is
relatively unimportant. In short, we expect that as the proportion of state

suggested earlier, another indicator of
the political environment is the presence of a tax or expenditure limitation
(TEL) statute. Perhaps a TEL is indicative of an underlying desire to

income on the indexing decision.

As

curtail government, in which case the presence of a TEL would increase the
probability of indexing. Alternatively, it could be that if a state has adopted
a TEL , its citizens require no additional instruments to control the size of

the public sector. In this case, the presence of a

TEL would

reduce the

probability of indexing. In any case, however, care must be taken in
assessing the relationship between TEL's and indexing, because the
decisions to adopt them may be made jointly.
A final variable that might affect the indexing decision is the inflation
rate itself. rndexing would not be an issue at all if-inflation were always
zero. Perhaps the "correct' model is simply that states adopt indexing when
the inflation rate is high, and then drop it when the inflation rate is low.
With

respect to the reneging decision, we expect the same variables to

operate as in the decision to index. Nevertheless, we note in passing that in
a number of conversations with state government officials, we were told that
the main reason for reneging was to deal with a financial crisis. Issues of
tax structure never came up in these discussions.

An Econometric Model of Indexing Status

In this section we construct a Markov model of states' indexing and

The Indexing Decision.

To begin, we estimate models with only

tax structure and fiscal stress variables. The first column of Table 3.2
shows the results when the probability of indexing is a function of the

elasticity of the income tax system (e), the ratio of income tax revenue
to total revenue (s), and per capita debt

structure and debt variables are fairly robust with respect to the inclusion
of TEL and Y . Compared to their counterparts in column (1), the
coefficients on e and DEBT are larger in absolute value, and the
coefficient on a is smaller. But the basic story is unchanged.
Thus far, our main substantive conclusion is that the more progressive
the income tax structure, the greater the probability of indexing,

several alternative notions of "progressive. Specifically, we characterize the

the results from Table 3.2 indicate that whether we

use marginal tax rates or elasticities as measures of tax structure,
the main qualitative result is the same.

Namely, tax systems that are

more prone to produce increasing real tax rates in the presence of
inflation are more likely to be indexed.

This effect shows up most

strongly when the income tax system is characterized by its overall income
elasticity.

19

We

also experimented with an alternative measure of fiscal stress,

the

state's deficit in the year prior to which indexing was adopted. In all cases,
DEFICIT did "worse" than DEBT in the sense of having smaller
t—statistics. (These results are available upon request.) Apparently, one
particular year's fiscal experience looms less important in the indexing
decision than the cumulative effect of all past fiscal decisions as measured by

the debt.
Next, in

order to investigate the possibility that the inflation rate

affects the indexing decision, each of the equations in Table 3.2 was
re—estimated including the inflation rate as a right hand side variable. The

results, reported in Table 3.3, suggest that: a) the inflation rate is not
statistically significant; and b) its inclusion does not affect the qualitative
results in the rest of the table very much. Of course, it would be silly to
interpret Table 3.3 as saying that inflation has nothing to do with indexing
decisions. What the Table does say is that during our sample period,
variations in the inflation rate do not do a very good job of explaining when

states chose to index.
far we have confined our discussion to the qualitative aspects of the
results. To obtain a sense of their quantitative significance, we assumed that
the indexing decision was governed by the parameters in column 1 of Table

year, p , to changes in the various right hand side variables. To

deviation, and leaving all others at their means.

doubles the probability of indexing. An increase in the share of

taxes in total revenues from 0.26 to 0.39 more than triples the

probability of indexing. The effect of fiscal stress is also important.
Increasing per capita debt from $500 to $885 cuts the probability that a state
will index by a factor of about 7.
2.

The Reneging Decision.

We

next turn to states' decisions to renege

given that they have adopted indexing. As noted above, to be included in

the sample for this equation, a state must commit itself to indexing.
Consequently, the number of observations is much smaller than that for the
indexing equation. Mechanically, the dependent variable for each observation
is determined as follows: After the time the indexing commitment is made, a
state is assigned a value of zero for each year the state continues to index,
and a one if it reneges. Once a state reneges, it is out of the sample.
The estimates are presented

in Table 3.5. As one would hope, they
tend to mirror the results for the indexing equations in Table 3.2. Consider
first columns (1), (2), and (3), where the income tax structure is
characterized by e

elasticity of revenues with respect to income. In
each equation, the coefficient on e is negative, suggesting that the more
, the

elastic the tax structure, the less likely is the state to abandon indexing. As
progressivity increases, the short run 'punishment" from abandoning
indexing exceeds the series of

future 'rewards generated by the ability to
rant more ad hoc tax decreases. However, unlike their counterparts in
Table 3.2, these coefficients are not statistically significant. We conjecture
that there are two reasons for this. First, as just noted, the sample size is
quite small, which tends to make it difficult to estimate parameters precisely.

21

Second, the sample consists of states that have chosen to index, and we

already know from Tables 3.1 and 3.2 that such states have higher
than average elasticites. Within this group there may simply not be enough
variation in e to pin down its coefficient.14

indicate that the larger a state's per capita debt, the more likely it is to

results from column (3) indicate that states with TEL's are less
likely to renege than states without them, ceteris pribus. Also, the higher
is per capita income, the less likely is reneging to occur. As is the case
with the indexing decision, however, these variables are not statistically
significant, and they do not have much of an impact on the estimates of the

are augmented with the inflation rate. As was the case for the indexing
equation, the inflation rate is insignificant, and does not have much of an
effect on the coefficients of the other variables.

change in the elasticity from 1.85 to 2.20 reduces

the probability of reneging in a given year from 0.14 to 0.07, a very strong
effect. On the other hand, changing the proportion of revenue collections
attributable to the personal income tax has a negligible effect on the
probability of reneging. Relatively high levels of debt per capita have a
substantial impact on the likelihood of reneging; increasing per capita debt
from $288 to $534 would increase the probability of reneging to almost 44

percent.

to index; and (2) Debt burdens play an important role in states' decisions to
abandon indexing.

these results tell us anything about the prospects for continued

however, that similar considerations do come into play. If so, the current
high levels of federal debt together with the decrease in marginal tax rates
associated with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 suggest a strong possibility that
indexing will be repealed. In this context, it is interesting to note that at

Finally, our paper has discussed

the response of states' indexing
decisions to the structures of their tax systems, but it has not attempted to

account for differences in the tax structures themselves. Recently, several
papers have examined cross sectional differences in the choice of tax
instrumentsJ5

Such papers attempt

to explain why, for example, some

jurisdictions rely more heavily on income taxation than others. They pay
little attention to the fact that the tax instruments themselves vary
substantially with respect to their progressivity. Investigating the sources
of tax structure heterogeneity is an important topic for future research.

gains and interest income are subject to tax. We do not deal with this
issue in the present paper.

2.

For a discussion of the macroeconomic consequences of tax indexing, see
Pierce and Enzler [1976].

3.

Six states (Idaho, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Carolina,
and Utah) base their taxes, in part, on indexed portions of the federal
law, thus indirectly imparting an element of indexation into their own
statutes.
However, these changes become relevant only after the time
period under consideration in this paper.

4.

Since the question of indexing vs. non—indexing is relevant only for
states with a personal income tax, those seven states without one are
excluded.
(Alaska, which abandoned its income tax in 1979, is excluded
from the sample.)

5.

Statistical significance is determined on the basis of the usual t—test
for the hypothesis that the difference between two means is zero.
Because the number of indexing states is small, the test is only
approximately correct.

6.

The "other things" include the level and composition of state expenditure.
Although explicit consideration of the spending side would complicate our
discussion, we do not think that it would change its tenor.

7.

As suggested above, "progressivity" can be measured in several ways.
For present purposes, it is sufficient to think of progressivity
loosely as the extent to which real tax burdens increase in response
to changes in nominal income.

8.

As an alternative to equation (3.3), one might consider employing a
hazard model, which explicitly considers the length of time required
for some event to occur. However, specification of a hazard model
requires that the initial condition of the process be known. For the
indexing decision, however, there is no obvious birth date. For the
reneging decision, the date that indexation was adopted might be used
as the starting point.
But given the small number of observations,
it is unlikely that the parameters of a reneging hazard function could

on an endogenous variables renders the coefficients inconsistent.

However, our substantive results are not
sensitive to these observations being omitted.
10.

One might argue that the progressivity of the tax structure is
determined jointly with the decision to index. However, our earlier
calculations (see Feenberg and Rosen [1986]) indicate that the states'
tax structures change very little over time; hence, we regard the
possibility that progressivity is endogenous to the indexing decision
as a remote one.

In the indexing logit, there are many more observations
in which states remain non—indexed than those in which they choose to
