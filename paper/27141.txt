The Cost of the Covid-19 Crisis: Lockdowns, Macroeconomic Expectations, and Consumer
Spending

NBER Working Paper No. 27141
May 2020
JEL No. C83,D84,E31,J26
ABSTRACT
We study how the differential timing of local lockdowns due to COVID-19 causally affects
households’ spending and macroeconomic expectations at the local level using several waves of a
customized survey with more than 10,000 respondents. About 50% of survey participants report
income and wealth losses due to the corona virus, with the average losses being $5,293 and
$33,482 respectively. Aggregate consumer spending dropped by 31 log percentage points with
the largest drops in travel and clothing. We find that households living in counties that went into
lockdown earlier expect the unemployment rate over the next twelve months to be 13 percentage
points higher and continue to expect higher unemployment at horizons of three to five years.
They also expect lower future inflation, report higher uncertainty, expect lower mortgage rates for
up to 10 years, and have moved out of foreign stocks into liquid forms of savings. The imposition
of lockdowns can account for much of the decline in employment in recent months as well as
declines in consumer spending. While lockdowns have pronounced effects on local economic
conditions and households’ expectations, they have little impact on approval ratings of Congress,
the Fed, or the Treasury but lead to declines in the approval of the President.

Business cycles are rarely a matter of life and death in advanced economies, but the COVID19 crisis is a grim
reminder that economics is a dismal science and that, quite literally, policymakers face a painful tradeoff
between saving lives and saving the economy. Apart from a myriad of excruciating ethical choices, making a
policy decision is particularly difficult in the current environment because policymakers and the public have
only limited information on the scale of the economic calamity as well as the economic cost of lockdowns.
To provide these crucial inputs for policy, we fielded several waves of a customized survey on all
households participating in the Kilts Nielsen Consumer Panel (KNCP) to elicit beliefs, employment status,
spending, and portfolio allocations both before and during the COVID19 crisis. In short, we paint a very
bleak state and outlook for the U.S. economy. We also use differential timing of imposing lockdowns at the
local level to quantify the effect of lockdowns on households’ economic outlook and their spending
responses. We find that the cost of lockdowns is very large.
We first report aggregate statistics across survey waves to study how the arrival COVID19 affected
spending patterns and expectations on average between the pre-crisis wave in January 2020 and April 2020.
Consistent with earlier work (Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Weber, 2020, Bick and Blandin, 2020), we find a
massive decline in the employment rate: the rate fell by 5 percentage points which is larger than the cumulative
drop in the employment-to-population ratio during and after the Great Recession. Overall spending drops by
$1,000 per month between January and April which corresponds to a 31% drop in spending with
heterogeneous responses across granular categories. Specifically, we find one of the largest drops in debt
payments including mortgages, student, and auto loans. This result highlights the possibility of a wave of
defaults in the next few months, indicating a slower economic recovery and possibly explaining the increase
in loan provisions by major US banks in recent weeks. Households also spend substantially less on
discretionary expenses such as transportation, travel, recreation, entertainment, clothing, and housing-related
expenses. Medical expenses, utilities, education-related expenses, and food expenses also decrease but to a
lesser extent. We also document large decreases in planned spending on durables during the crisis. On average,
survey participants are 5 percentage points less likely to purchase durables during the crisis wave relative to
the pre-crisis wave which translates into an average drop in spending on durables of almost $1,000.
In line with these negative outcomes at the individual level, households’ macroeconomic
expectations have become far more pessimistic. Average perceptions of the current unemployment rate
increased by 11 percentage points with similar magnitudes for expectations of unemployment in one year.
Unemployment expectations over the next three to five years also increased by an average of 1.2 percentage
points, indicating that households expect the downturn to have persistently negative effects on the labor
market. Consistent with this view, inflation expectations over the next twelve months on average dropped
by 0.5 percentage points but uncertainty increased by 0.3 percentage points. Current mortgage rate
perceptions as well as expectations for the end of 2020 and 2021 dropped on average by about 0.4
1

percentage points with even larger drops in average expectations over the next five to ten years. These
changes from before to during the COVID19 pandemic document dramatic shifts in spending, income and
wealth losses, and expectations and allow us to benchmark our cross-sectional findings to these aggregate
statistics. The increased uncertainty at the household level as well the large drop in planned spending
indicate the potential role for some form of liquidity insurance to curb the desire for precautionary spending
and stimulate demand once local lockdowns are lifted (D’Acunto et al. 2020).
To assess the economic damage that households attribute to the virus, we elicit information on the
perceived financial situation of the survey participants and possible losses due to the corona virus, both in
income and wealth. We measure households’ concerns about their financial situation on a ten-point Likert
scale with higher levels indicating being more concerned. The average (median) response is 7 (8) indicating
that many households are highly concerned about their personal financial situation. We also find large declines
both in their income and wealth. Forty-two percent of employed respondents report having lost earnings due
to the virus with the average loss being more than $5,000. More than 50% of households with significant
financial wealth report having lost wealth due to the virus and the average wealth lost is at $33,000. Given the
important role of wealth effects for consumption, the drop in wealth puts further downward pressure on future
consumption (Lettau and Ludvigson, 2004).
What are the economic costs of lockdowns? To answer this question, we compare economic outcomes
for households in counties with lockdowns to households in counties without lockdowns. We instrument
lockdowns with a dummy variable that equals one if the county has any confirmed COVID cases. Our
identification exploits the heterogeneous timing of when the first COVID cases were identified in different
counties. As we argue below, most lockdowns occur when only a handful of COVID cases are reported in a
location, which is largely random. By themselves, these few cases are unlikely to change economic behavior
of households (we provide external evidence to support this identifying assumption). We also control for share
of confirmed cases at the county level which proxies for direct health effects on the economy. While our
analysis is not a randomized controlled trial, we have taken a number of steps to interpret the effect of
lockdowns on beliefs and choices causally.
In our first set of tests, we study the labor market response to local lockdowns. Individuals living
in counties currently under lockdown are 2.8 percentage points less likely to be employed, have a 1.9
percentage points lower labor-force participation, and are 2.4 percentage points more likely to be
unemployed. This degree of variation introduced by lockdowns is large. For example, these results imply
that lockdowns account for close to sixty percent of the decline in the employment to population ratio.
Furthermore, since we can only estimate the short-run effects of lockdowns on labor markets, these numbers
are likely to be a lower bound on the total effects of lockdowns on labor markets, as continued lockdowns
are likely to lead to business failures and further job loss.
2

To analyze the degree to which disruptions in labor markets translate into changes in aggregate
demand, we study the spending patterns of survey participants using survey answers on dollar spending in
narrowly defined categories during the months from January to April. We find that households under
lockdown spend on average 31 log percentage points less than other households, indicating a large drop in
aggregate demand due to mobility restrictions and the effect of the pandemic on income and economic
expectations. However, the magnitudes of the decline vary dramatically across spending categories. To better
understand the effect of the pandemic on future aggregate demand conditions, we analyze spending plans of
households. We first document that lockdowns are not a significant determinant of current financial
constraints and durable purchases in the months pre-crisis, thereby ruling out possible concerns that any result
we document might be driven by financial constraints or past purchases because purchases of many durable
goods are lumpy. At the extensive margin, survey participants under lockdown are 3.5 percentage points less
likely to purchases larger ticket items in the next 12 months. At the intensive margin, these survey participants
plan to spend almost 26 log percentage points less. Taken together, these results indicate a persistent drop in
future aggregate demand, possibly due to a mix of lower expected income, heightened uncertainty, and supply
restrictions. To the extent that part of the drop in planned spending reflects precautionary savings, our results
indicate that tax rebates or other forms of direct transfers to households might be less effective than during
normal recessions (Johnson et al. 2006, Parker et al. 2013).
Higher uncertainty should not only result in lower spending due to precautionary motives but might
also result in portfolio reallocations out of risky assets and into safe assets. Conditional on having savings
totaling more than one-month of income, participants under lockdown have a 1.7 percentage point higher
portfolio share in checking accounts and a 0.7 percentage point lower share in foreign stocks, consistent
with a flight to safety. We do not find a significant reaction for the share of savings held in US equity,
possibly because US equity markets already had partially bounced back by the time we fielded the survey
in early April of 2020.
We then move on to study the effect of lockdowns on subjective expectations, which can shed light
on the speed and shape of the recovery. First, survey participants that are under lockdown expect 0.5
percentage points lower inflation over the next 12 months, which might in part explain the depressed spending
response of households. Consistent with the idea that the impact of the pandemic on inflation is not clear, we
find that the individual-level uncertainty about future expected inflation increases by more than 0.6 percentage
points. Second, we analyze the effect on the expected unemployment rate at different horizons. The pandemic
increases current unemployment estimates by staggering 13.8 percentage points, expectations for the
unemployment rate in one year increase by 13 percentage points, and long-run expectations over the next
three to five years are on average still 2.4 percentage points higher. These results indicate, at least through the
lens of household expectations, that a V-shaped recovery might be unlikely. Moreover, given the length of
3

heightened unemployment according to household expectations, these results could warrant an extension of
unemployment insurance benefits to ensure no sharp drop in demand once claims expire. Third, we look at
the effect on mortgage rate expectations, which are a central transmission mechanism for monetary policy to
household consumption. The COVID-19 pandemic results in current mortgage rate perceptions that are 0.7
percentage points lower, with similar effects for a forecast horizon until the end of 2020, 2021 but even larger
effects at the long run over the next five to ten years. Hence, the pandemic results in a level shift of the term
structure of mortgage rates. The negative effect on expectations in the long run suggests that the lower bound
on nominal interest rates might be a binding constraint for monetary policy makers for the foreseeable future.
Finally, to assess the political consequences of lockdowns, we ask respondents to rate several
government bodies on a 0 (poor) to 10 (excellent) scale. We find that being under lockdown results in a 6.2
point lower rating for the President but a 3.1 point higher rating for the U.S. Center for Disease Control. Taken
together, our findings help us understand the drivers of heterogeneous consumer expectations and spending
patterns which is crucial to design policy interventions in an effective way.
Jointly, these findings provide new real-time evidence on the economic consequences of the COVID19 pandemic. Our repeated surveys are able to provide unprecedented detail on how the COVID crisis has
affected labor markets, household spending decisions and expectations, and even portfolio reallocations in
recent months. Strikingly, we find that much of the declines in employment and spending can be attributed to
lockdowns rather than to the share of the population infected by the coronavirus. While we cannot speak to
the welfare effects of these policies in the absence of knowing to what extent they are successful in slowing
the spread of the disease, our results do indicate a direct and large role for the preventative lockdown measures
in accounting for the size of the resulting downturn.

Related Literature

We relate to the fast-growing literature studying the economic consequences of the COVID19 pandemic.
Binder (2020) shows that 30% - 40% of Americans are very concerned about the corona crisis, postponed
travel and delayed purchases of larger ticket items as early as March 2020 but became more optimistic
about the unemployment situation and revised downward their inflation expectations once being told about
the cut in the federal funds target rate on March 3rd. Fetzer et al. (2020) show the arrival of the corona virus
in a country leads to a large increase in internet searches around the world. In a survey experiment on a US
population, they find survey participants vastly overestimate the mortality rate and the contagiousness of
the virus. Hanspal et al. (2020) study the income and wealth loss in a survey and the impact on expectations
about the economic recovery. Barrios and Hochberg (2020) and Allcott et al. (2020) use internet searches,
survey data, and travel data from smartphones to document that political partisanship determines the
perception of risk associated with COVID19 and non-essential travel activity. Bursztyn et al. (2020) study
4

the effect of media consumption on the perception of the corona virus. Dingel and Neiman (2020) use data
from responses to two Occupational Information Network surveys and estimate that about 37% of jobs can
be performed from home, whereas Mongey (2020) documents that employees that are less likely to be able
to work from home are mainly non-white and without a college degree. Using initial unemployment
insurance claims, Baek et al. (2020) study the effect of lockdowns on employment at the state-level.
Andersen et al. (2020), Chen et al. (2020), and Baker et al. (2020) study the consumption response to the
COVID19 pandemic. On the quantitative side, a growing literature jointly models the dynamics of the
pandemic and the economy to quantify the economic costs and benefits of different policies (see Atkeson
(2020), Barro et al. (2020), Eichenbaum et al. (2020), Farboodi et al. (2020), Jones et al. (2020), Kaplan et
al. (2020), Krueger et al. (2020), Guerrieri et al. (2020), Alvarez et al. (2020), and Dietrich et al. (2020)).
Finally, our Nielsen survey builds on previous work using the Nielsen panelists to study the formation and
updating of economic expectations (Coibion et al. (2019, 2020) and D’Acunto et al (2020a, b)). Coibion et
al. (2020) also use Nielsen surveys to study the effect of the pandemic on labor markets and find large drops
in labor-force participation due to a wave of early retirements.

Data and Survey Design

This section describes the survey design we use to elicit expectations, plans, and past spending decisions. We
first detail the Nielsen Homescan panel on which we run the survey and then provide more information on the
structure of the survey.

A.

Nielsen Panel

Since June 2018, we have been fielding customized surveys inviting participation by all household members
in the KNCP on a quarterly frequency. The KNCP represents a panel of approximately 60,000 households
that report to AC Nielsen (i) their static demographic characteristics, such as household size, income, ZIP
code of residence, and marital status, and (ii) the dynamic characteristics of their purchases, that is, which
products they purchase, at which outlets, and at which prices. Panelists update their demographic information
at an annual frequency to reflect changes in household composition or marital status.
Nielsen attempts to balance the panel on nine dimensions: household size, income, age of household
head, education of female household head, education of male household head, presence of children,
race/ethnicity, and occupation of the household head. Panelists are recruited online, but the panel is balanced
using Nielsen’s traditional mailing methodology. Nielsen checks the sample characteristics on a weekly basis
and performs adjustments when necessary.
Nielsen provides households with various incentives to guarantee the accuracy and completeness
of the information households report. They organize monthly prize drawings, provide points for each
5

instance of data submission, and engage in ongoing communication with households. Panelists can use
points to purchase gifts from a Nielsen-specific award catalog. Nielsen structures the incentives to not bias
the shopping behavior of their panelists. The KNCP has a retention rate of more than 80% at the annual
frequency. Nielsen validates the reported consumer spending with the scanner data of retailers on a
quarterly frequency to ensure high data quality. The KNCP filters households that do not report a minimum
amount of spending over the previous 12 months. Information on consumer spending is available only with
a pronounced lag however, so we are not yet able to combine information from our survey responses with
underlying spending decisions on the part of households.

B.

Survey

Nielsen runs surveys on a monthly frequency on a subset of panelists in the KNCP, the online panel, but also
offers customized solutions for longer surveys. Retailers and fast-moving consumer-goods producers
purchase this information and other services from Nielsen for product design and target-group marketing. At
no point of the survey did Nielsen tell their panelists that the survey they fielded was part of academic research
which minimizes the concerns of survey demand effects.
In January and April of 2020, we fielded the two waves of the survey that we exploit in the current
paper. Our survey design builds on the Michigan Survey of Consumers, the New York Fed Survey of
Consumer Expectations, the Panel on Household Finances at the Deutsche Bundesbank as well as D’Acunto
et al. (2020). The January wave was fielded to 63,732 households. 18,344 individuals responded for a response
rate of 26.80% and an average response time of 16 minutes 47 seconds. The response rate compares favorably
to the average response rates of surveys on Qualtrics that estimates a response rate between 5% to 10%. The
April wave had 13,771 unique respondents and a sample of 50,870. Nielsen provides weights to ensure
representativeness of the households participating in the survey. We report descriptive statistics for
participating households in Appendix Table 1. The average household income is $68,000 and the average
household size 2.6. On average, survey participants are 50 years old and 73% of survey participants are white
These statistics are similar to other studies using the Nielsen panel, such as Coibion at al. (2019).
The online appendix contains the detailed questions we use in the current paper. We collect
information on spending (per month) in the last three months in detailed categories such as debt payments
including mortgages, auto loans, and student loans, housing expenses, utilities, food, clothing, gas, medical
expenses, transportation costs, travel and entertainment, education and child care, furniture and other small
durables, as well as a catch-all category including charitable giving. We also ask participants about purchases
of larger durables such as cars or houses over the last 6 months as well as plans to buy these items over the
next 12 months. We then elicit financial constraints, and financial portfolios conditional on any savings larger
than one month of income.
6

Subsequently, we elicit inflation expectations. We follow the design in the New York Fed Survey of
Consumer Expectations (SCE) and ask specifically about inflation, because asking about prices might induce
individuals to think about specific items whose prices they recall rather than about overall inflation (see Crump
et al. (2015) for a paper describing and using the SCE data). We elicit a full probability distribution of
expectations by asking participants to assign probabilities to different possible levels of the inflation rate. In
addition, we also ask about the perception of the current unemployment rate and the expected unemployment
rate in twelve months, and the next three to five years and the current rate on a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage
as well as the expected rate at the end of 2020, 2021, and in the next five to ten years. Mortgages with a 30year fixation period represent the most popular mortgage product in the U.S., accounting for more than 70%
of mortgages originated over the period 2013-2016.1
To measure labor market conditions, we first ask respondents on whether they have a paid job and if
they say no, whether they are actively looking for a job. If they answer no, we classify them as out of the labor
force. In case survey participants have a paid job, we ask them whether they have lost any earnings due to the
virus and if so, ask them to provide an estimate. Similarly, if respondents have savings of more than one month
of income, we also ask them whether they have lost any wealth and if so, how much.
Regarding the corona virus, we ask participants if they have heard any news about it and if so, how
concerned they are about their financial situation with a qualitative scale from 0 to 10. Moreover, we ask them
whether they are currently under lockdown (we also observe their zipcodes), and ask to evaluate how different
government bodies are handling the crisis. Finally, we ask households to estimate expected duration of
lockdowns and time before conditions return to normal.

III

The COVID19 Crisis in the Survey Data

A major contribution of our study to the growing literature on the effects of COVID19 on expectations and
spending is the panel dimension of our survey. Hence, we can study in detail how spending, perceptions,
and expectations changed over time pre and during the pandemic and also benchmark our cross-sectional
estimates to the movements in these aggregates over time.

A. Pre-crisis vs. Crisis Statistics
Tables 1 and 2 provide average statistics of all the variables we analyze in the paper for the pre-crisis wave
in January, the crisis wave in April, as well as the difference. Panel A of Table 1 first documents the labor
market statistics. Consistent with Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Weber (2020), we find a dramatic (5
percentage point) drop in employment which is larger than the cumulative decrease in the employment-to-

Agency (FHFA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

population ratio during and after the Great Recession. The unemployment rate only increased by 2
percentage points because more than 4 percent of our survey population dropped out of the labor force
which is even larger than the cumulative drop in labor-force participation between 2008 and 2016 of 3
percentage points.2
Panel B of Table 1 studies differences in liquidity and financial constraints across survey waves.
Surprisingly, the fraction of survey participants that is able to cover an unexpected expense equal to one month
of income slightly increases.3 In a similar spirit, the fraction of households reporting significant financial
wealth (more than one month of income) increases slightly.4 Given the collapse of employment and financial
markets, one may have expected that households should have less liquidity and access to credit. However,
there is an offsetting factor. Because consumer spending declines dramatically, household could have greater
(precautionary) savings and hence, on balance, there is little change in liquidity and access to credit.5
Panel C focuses on portfolio reallocations for the subsample of survey participants that have
savings larger than one months of income. In the aggregate, we find small decreases in portfolio shares for
cash, foreign assets, and gold but increases in US bonds and stocks. Overall, the portfolio reallocations are,
however, small consistent with many savers not trading frequently (Giglio et al., 2019).
Finally, Panels D to G report average statistics for inflation expectations and uncertainty,
unemployment and mortgage rates, both current, over the near future, as well as in the longer run. Inflation
expectations on average dropped by 0.5 percentage points but uncertainty increased by 0.3 percentage
points. Average perceptions of current unemployment rates increased by 11 percentage points with similar
magnitudes for expectations in one year. Unemployment expectations over the next three to five years also
increased by an average of 1.2 percentage points. These results are qualitatively similar (i.e., a large, shortrun increase in unemployment with unemployment rates elevated by one percentage point in 3-5 years)
when we drop observations for unemployment rates larger than 40% but economic magnitudes of the
average differences across waves are about half the size. Current mortgage rate perceptions as well as
expectations for the end of 2020 and 2021 also dropped on average by about 0.4 percentage points with
even larger drops in average expectations over the next five to ten years. The

Unemployment is defined as the ratio of those respondents that currently do not have a paid job but are looking for
one. We define labor-force participation as the fraction of the overall survey population that is either employed or
looking for work.
3
The survey question is “Suppose that you had to make an unexpected payment equal to one month of your after-tax
income, would you have sufficient financial resources (access to credit, savings, loans from relatives or friends, etc.)
to pay for the entire amount?”
4
The survey question is “Does your household have total financial investments (excluding housing) worth more than
one month of combined household income?”
5
Another possibility is that income declined so much that more households can find credit to cover this
correspondingly reduced amount of spending.

expectations show some dramatic differences across waves pre and during the crisis and allow us to
benchmark our cross-sectional estimates below to movements in the aggregate.
We now move on to study the change in average monthly spending in the three months before the
two survey waves. One concern with survey data is that participants might only partially recall their past
expenditure. To benchmark our survey data, we first compare the reported average monthly spending in the
January wave to the monthly spending in the 2018 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). To do so, we
take the annual data from the CEX, divide it by 12 to get monthly averages, and match the survey categories
to the categories in the CEX. Some differences are expected for at least two reasons. First, no one-to-one
mapping exists between categories in the different datasets. Second, consumer spending is seasonal and the
CEX survey is a monthly average over a year, while the Nielsen survey covers a specific part of a year.
Despite these inconsistencies, consumer spending in the Nielsen survey is reasonably close to consumer
spending in the CEX (Appendix Table 2). Overall monthly spending in our survey is $3,999 which is
smaller than the average monthly spending in the CEX of $5,102 which is expected because the CEX also
includes additional categories which we did not elicit in the survey as well as larger durables such as car
purchases and larger appliances. Excluding these categories moves the two averages closer to each other.
As for debt payments which include student loans we see larger expenditures in the January wave than in
the CEX which does not have a separate category for student loans. Housing related expenses including
rent and maintenance among other expenses compare closely with monthly expenses of $616 in our survey
and $535 in the CEX. Similarly, for utilities which also includes phone and internet, and food which
includes groceries, dine out, and beverages, both surveys report spending of $429 and $532 (KNPC) and
$455 and $709 (CEX), respectively. As for clothing and footwear, we find averages of $126 in the KNCP
and $220 in the CEX. For expenditures on gasoline, the category which matches closest across surveys, we
indeed find almost identical averages, $174 versus $176. Overall, we conclude that the survey-elicited
expenses line up reasonably closely to averages we can find in the CEX and suggest our subsequent analysis
provides meaningful insights. Another advantage of our survey design relative to repeated cross-sections is
the fact that we can do comparisons across survey waves in the same sample population which allows us to
difference out systematic misreporting (i.e., some survey respondents systematically over- or
underreporting certain categories).
Table 2 reports the overall monthly dollar spending as well as the split down by categories. Note
that households can report zero spending for a given category in a wave and average spending in columns
(1) and (2) includes households with zero spending. To make descriptive statistics more comparable to the
results we report below, we also compute the growth rate of log (1 + 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆), that is,

�������������������������
�������������������������
log(1 + 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆)𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 − log(1
+ 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆)𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽 . We do this particular transformation of the data

to handle the skewness of consumer spending and to take into account variation in the extensive margin,
9

that is, some households stop spending on some categories. We see that overall spending over the last three
months drops by $1,000 per month between January and April. The decline in the averages corresponds to
a drop of 31 log percentage points in spending. Across categories, we see the largest average drops for
travel, clothing, debt payments, and housing with decreases of 150, 110, 92, and 88 log percentage points,
respectively.6 To better understand the nature of these declines, we also report extensive and intensive
margins of each spending category in columns (4)-(6) and (7)-(9) respectively. The extensive margin
measures whether a survey participants has spent any money in a given category, whereas the intensive
margin reports average dollar spending conditional on any spending. We observe large declines in the
extensive margin not only for travel (the share of household reporting spending on this category declines
by 31 percentage points) and clothing (22 percentage points) but also for debt payments and housing (which
includes rent), by 12 and 15 percentage points, respectively. Hence, households mainly curb their
discretionary spending and adjust their non-discretionary spending by less, which is consistent with
D’Acunto et al. (2019). Furthermore, we observe that even for those that have positive debt payments, the
size of the payment declines by approximately 15 log percentage points, while for housing (rent) the change
in the intensive margin is zero (i.e., conditional on paying rent, households pay the full rent). These results
suggest that constrained households stop servicing their debt and housing payments. Results for the
intensive margins of other categories suggest that households downsize their purchases conditional of
buying goods/services in a category. Given the importance of mortgage defaults for the severity of the Great
Recession, these results suggest a sluggish recovery and substantial defaults in the coming months absent
adequate policy interventions (Mian et al., 2013).
Table 2 also reports spending on durables over the previous six months, both at the extensive margin,
any durable purchase, and the intensive margin, the realized dollar spending. The survey question specifies
durables as a house (apartment), a car, or a large appliance. We see a slight increase in the frequency of
spending on durables over the last six months in our April survey wave but no difference in the intensive
margin. Because the reference period is the previous six months and the speed at which the COVID crisis has
been unfolding, we are less likely to capture material variation between the pre-crisis and crisis periods.
The last row of Table 2 focuses on planned durable purchases (intensive and extensive margins)
over the next twelve months. Here, we find large decreases in planned spending on durables during our
crisis wave. On average, survey participants are 5 percentage points less likely to purchase durables during
the crisis wave relative to the pre-crisis wave but conditional on a purchase the average amount is higher,
which indicates possibly strong selection effects. When we measure the decline using log (1 + 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆)

which combines both margins, the planned purchases of durable goods decline by 30 log percentage points.

6

These figures correspond to 77.8, 66.7, 60.1, and 58.5 percentage point declines.

10

In short, we observe a massive decline in consumer spending and consumers anticipate reduced
spending in the coming months, which is consistent with other data. For example, Baker et al. (2020) observe
subsets of spending through a FinTech app and find decreases of restaurant spending of one third with overall
average daily spending decreasing by two thirds between January and March but sharp increases in groceries
early in the pandemic due to stockpiling with a decline during the end of March. Chen et al. (2020) use data
from the largest bankcard acquiring and professional service supplier in China and find spending on goods
and services decrease by 33%, whereas spending on entertainment and travel plummeted by about 60%.
Anderson et al. (2020) uses transaction-level customer data from the largest bank in Denmark and
documented that overall spending dropped by 25% with the largest decreases for food away from home and
travel with more than 60% and almost 80%, respectively. Hence, our survey-based estimates are consistent
with transaction-based analysis for several countries. Our analysis, though, has the potential advantage that
we can observe overall spending and not only subsets of spending via credit cards or QR codes. From a
historical perspective, these drops are large. De Nardi et al. (2012) use real personal consumption expenditure
data and argue that overall consumption grew 15 percentage points less over the subsequent five years from
2007Q4 onwards compared to historical averages with even larger declines in services consumption.

Direct COVID19 Impacts

Table 3 reports several descriptive statistics for variables measuring welfare of survey participants in the
context of the COVID crisis. First, we find that respondents have high levels of concerns about their
household’s financial situation. On a scale from 0 (not concerned) to 10 (extremely concerned), the mean
response is 7.2 and the median response is 8. A third of respondents chose the maximum score of 10.
Second, we find that even employed households report a considerable loss of labor earnings. Approximately
40 percent of the employed reported lost earnings because of COVID concerns. Conditional on losing
earnings, the median loss is $1,500 but the mean loss is much higher at more than $5,000. Third, 54 percent
of respondents with materially important financial wealth (worth more than one-month of household
income) report losses in financial wealth because of COVID concerns. Because the distribution of wealth
is highly skewed, the mean loss (approximately $33,500) is much greater than the median loss ($9,000).
These statistics suggest that the COVID crisis has a significant impact on income and wealth of households.
These numbers are similar to Hanspal et al (2020) who report average income losses of about $3,000 and
wealth losses of about $50,000.
We also ask respondents to report the expected duration of lockdowns in their locations and the
expected time before conditions return to normal in their locations. On average, lockdowns are expected to
last 83 days and normalcy is expected to return in approximately six months. However, there is significant

11

variation in these estimates: the standard deviation is 48 days for the lockdown duration and 140 days for
the return time.

C.

Lockdowns and COVID19 Infections

Figure 1 graphically illustrates the geographic spread of lockdowns at the county level according to our
survey. The darker the color, the higher the fraction of the survey participants reporting being under
lockdown. White represents counties without any data. We see substantial variation in the lockdown status
with intensive lockdowns in the West, North East, and northern Midwest, which is consistent with the data
reported in Baek et al. (2020).
To provide a sense for time variation in the distribution of lockdowns and COVID cases, Figure 2
shows the evolution of the fraction of counties with a lockdown as well as the fraction of counties with
reported COVID cases above various thresholds. We take the timing of lockdowns at the county level from
Baek et al. (2020) and the time series of confirmed COVID infections from Barrios and Hochberg (2020). We
observe a significant spread of COVID cases before counties start to introduce lockdowns. Indeed, the fraction
of counties with at least one confirmed COVID case leads the fraction of counties with a lockdown. For
example, on March 22, 2020, more than 30 percent of counties had at least one confirmed COVID case, but
only 10 percent of counties had a lockdown. Note that the fraction of counties with 10+ cases or with 100+
cases grows at a slower rate and as we increase the threshold for the number of confirmed cases, the fraction
of counties with cases above a higher threshold generally lags the fraction of counties with lockdowns.
Given that lockdowns deterred social mobility substantially (Barrios and Hochberg, 2020), we now
study how the COVID-induced lockdowns causally determine employment, consumer spending and
expectations and whether lockdowns can account for aggregate economic conditions.

IV

Econometric Framework for Measuring the Lockdown Effects

To estimate the effect of lockdown on economic activity, we need to address two related identification
concerns. First, COVID infections may have a direct effect on the local economy. For example, workers
may fail to show up at work because they fell sick with the virus or may have to take care of sick family
members. Second, lockdowns are not applied randomly by policymakers and it could be that the same
factors that lead policymakers to implement lockdowns also induce behavioral changes on the part of the
population. For example, people concerned about the virus may self-quarantine thus depressing the
economy before a shelter-at-home order is announced. Because of this behavioral response, a lockdown

12

may appear to have a larger effect on the economy than its actual direct effect. In short, estimates of
lockdown effects may be confounded by omitted variables.7
To tackle these concerns, we estimate the following econometric specification:
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜅𝜅𝑖𝑖 + 𝜓𝜓 × 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂 × 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒

𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽 × 𝕀𝕀�𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑠𝑠 > 0� + 𝛾𝛾 × 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒

(1)
(2)

where 𝑖𝑖, 𝑗𝑗 index persons and counties and 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑠𝑠 index time. 𝑡𝑡 are the January and April survey waves,

𝑡𝑡 − 𝑠𝑠 shows the time of exposure to COVID 𝑠𝑠 periods before wave 𝑡𝑡 to determine variation in lockdowns

in county 𝑗𝑗. 𝑌𝑌 is an outcome variable. 𝜅𝜅𝑖𝑖 is a person fixed effect. 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 is a dummy variable equal to
one if person 𝑖𝑖 in county 𝑗𝑗 reports being in lockdown at time 𝑡𝑡. 𝕀𝕀�𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 > 0� is a dummy variable equal

to one if county 𝑗𝑗 reported a positive number of COVID infections at time 𝑠𝑠. There is no lockdown or

confirmed COVID case for any county in the January wave. 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is the share of the population

with confirmed COVID infection in county 𝑗𝑗 at time 𝑡𝑡, the share is measured in percent (i.e., from 0 to 100).

𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 proxies for the first concern that COVID infections can have a direct effect on the economy

by influencing health of workers and consumers, thus addressing the first identification concern. Data on

local COVID infections are from Barrios and Hochberg (2020). Because variation in policy is at the county
level, we cluster standard errors at the county level.
Equation (2) is the first-stage regression for 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿. Our identifying assumption is that local

public health authorities are likely to impose a lockdown as soon as a single case of a COVID infection in a

location is confirmed. The timing of this first case is largely random and can reflect idiosyncratic travel of
local individuals, the ability or willingness of local authorities to do COVID tests, etc. Because the number of
confirmed cases initially is very low (which we can achieve by choosing an appropriate date 𝑠𝑠), it is unlikely

to generate a large public concern about contracting the virus or to have a direct health effect on the local
population. Instead, the endogenous response of the local population to COVID concerns is more likely to

reflect the prevalence of the disease locally, which would be captured by the 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 variable. Note
that with this identifying assumption, we effectively measure the effect of lockdowns by comparing late and
early adopters of lockdown policies and therefore we may miss general equilibrium effects.
While we cannot statistically validate this identifying assumption, we can assess its quality
indirectly by examining external data. First, we examine the distribution of COVID cases at the time when
7

The effect of first confirmed COVID infections on the decision to introduce a lockdown can be heterogeneous across
locations. For example, locations with a higher density of population could be more vulnerable to a fast dissemination
of the virus and thus may implement lockdowns earlier than locations with lower densities. The public media also
suggest that locations with a large share of Trump supporters appear to have a lower propensity to introduce lockdowns
in response to COVID. We find some support for these hypotheses in the data (Appendix Table 3), but introducing
heterogeneity in the propensity to adopt lockdowns has no material effect on our second-stage estimates and thus we
consider a simple specification for the first stage.

13

a lockdown is implemented. Figure 3 shows that approximately 75 percent of counties have less than 10
confirmed COVID cases at the time when a lockdown is implemented. Furthermore, going from zero cases
to one case is associated with a 15 percent higher probability of a lockdown. Thus, it takes only a handful
of cases—which is hardly enough to have a discernable direct health effect on the local economy—before
a county is under a lockdown.
Second, we use event analysis to investigate how lockdowns and first reported COVID cases
influence dynamics for proxies of economic activity. In particular, we use the insight of Baek et al. (2020)
and estimate the following specification:
14
𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 + 𝜙𝜙𝜏𝜏 + ∑𝜍𝜍=−8

in Figure 4.

We find weak (if any) pre-trends in the data for lockdowns (we replicate Figure 5 in Baek et al. 2020) or
first COVID cases. Each event reduces mobility but mobility declines by an order of magnitude more to a
lockdown than to a first COVID case. Given consumer spending and/or employment are highly correlated
with mobility (Baker et al., 2020), economic activity is unlikely to be materially affected by reports of a
first confirmed COVID case. We conclude that our identifying assumption is plausible.
Table 4 reports estimates for the first stage regression (equation (2)) for various choices of 𝑠𝑠, the

date that we use to determine whether a county has confirmed COVID cases. We see that the dummy
variable for confirmed COVID cases is a strong predictor of lockdowns at the local level across different
time periods. The t-statistic on 𝕀𝕀�𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑠𝑠 > 0� is well above 10 thus suggesting a strong first stage, that

is, the instrument is relevant. Note that the coefficient on 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is statistically significant only
when we use 𝑠𝑠 equal to March 22, 2020 or later, while the survey is fielded in the first week of April (i.e.,
the lockdown dummy in the “crisis” wave refers to April 2-23, 2020). This suggests that the intensity of

results are not driven by direct health effects, we set 𝑠𝑠 so that 𝑡𝑡 − 𝑠𝑠 referes to March 15, i.e., two weeks

before the survey.

V

Perceptions, Expectations, and Choices during Lockdowns

We now causally study the effect of lockdowns on outcomes 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 such as spending, employment,

expectations, and perceptions via instrumental variable regressions.9 These results can be an important input
into policy discussions about adequate measures of fiscal and monetary policy to stabilize local economies
but are also important to measure the economic costs of lockdowns that are key determinants for discussions
about re-opening the economy.

A. Employment status
We first analyze the effect of lockdowns on labor-market statistics. Colum (1) of Table 5 shows individuals
in counties under lockdown are 2.8 percentage points less likely to be employed relative to other survey
participants. Compared to the overall drop in employment we document, we find that 60% of the overall
decline is driven by survey participants in early lockdown counties. Column (2) studies the effect on laborforce participation and column (3) on unemployment. Lockdowns have a sizeable effect on both variables.
Individuals under lockdown have a 1.9 percentage point lower labor-force participation and a 2.4
percentage point higher unemployment rate. The difference in the unemployment rate between individuals
in counties under lockdowns and other counties corresponds to a third of the overall rise in unemployment
during the Great Recession, whereas the difference in the labor-force participation corresponds to almost
80% of the decline between 2008 and 2016. Moreover, the rise in unemployment corresponds to even more
than 100% of the overall average rise we document in Panel A of Table 1 suggesting redistributive effects
across counties. In short, lockdowns appear to have immediate and large consequences of employment and
can account for much of the deterioration in the labor market that has occurred in the U.S. in 2020.

B. Consumer spending
Does this dramatic change in labor market conditions due to COVID19 induced lockdowns translate into
changes in spending patterns? Table 6 reports the second-stage results for log(1 + 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠) for overall

spending and for granular subcategories in the previous three months. We see that lockdowns are associated
with a drop in overall spending equal to 31 log percent which is even slightly larger than the overall drop
we document in Panel A of Table 2. Recreation, travel, and entertainment expenses, clothing and footwear,

9

We report OLS estimates in Appendix Table 4 through Appendix Table 8. In general, we find that OLS estimates
are smaller than IV estimates but the qualitative results are similar.

15

housing expenses including rent and maintenance, transportation, and debt payments including mortgages,
auto, and student loans see the largest declines in spending with 184, 128, 110, 92, and 71 log percentage
points, respectively. Gasoline also has a large decrease in dollar spending which could partially be driven
by the large decrease in oil prices. Instead, for utilities, food, or education and childcare, we only observe
modest drops consistent with findings in Andersen et al. (2020), and intermediate drops for small durables
such as furniture and medical expenses. These heterogeneous responses in spending across categories to
local lockdowns are consistent with supply restrictions, individuals no longer being able to travel and nonessential businesses being closed but also in part reflect differences between discretionary and nondiscretionary spending (D’Acunto et al. 2020c). Moreover, these results suggest different sectors in the
economy might be differentially exposed to drops in consumer spending. This has important implications
for the design and implementation of government programs such as loans programs as well as for the overall
speed and the differential speed of the recovery across sectors of the economy and geographic partitions.
Our results can therefore inform the current debate on federal help for local economies and states.
We move on to study the effect of lockdowns on durable purchases that are the most cyclical
component of consumption. Durable purchases are lumpy and occur infrequently and financial constraints
might be an important impediment for these purchases. Hence, we first study whether survey respondents
differ systematically in their financial constraints and past purchases of durables by lockdown status. We
find no systematic difference exists in the degree to which individuals are able to cover an unexpected
expense equal to one month of income (see Panel B of Table 7). Similarly, no difference exists in the degree
to which survey respondents purchased durable goods in the last six months (Panel B of Table 6). Panel C
of Table 6, instead, indicates large drops in plans to spend on durables both at the extensive margin and the
intensive margin. Survey participants under lockdown are more than 3.5 percentage points less likely to
purchase durable goods in the next 12 months and plan to spend almost 26 log percentage points less. This
drop in planned spending is almost 100% of the aggregate drop in planned spending in Table 2 across the
survey waves in January and April 2020.

C. Liquidity and portfolio allocations
During times of crisis and uncertainty, a flight to safety and quality often occurs, reflected in a surge in
treasuries and the US dollar. To study whether similar phenomena also happen at the individual portfolio
level, we now examine the sample of individuals that have savings larger than one month of income in
Panel A of Table 7. Consistent with the macro trends, we find that survey participants in lockdown counties
have a portfolio share in liquid savings that is 1.7 percentage points higher than other participants even
though not statistically significant. The increase in portfolio shares in checking accounts is of the opposite
sign to the average in Panel C of Table 1 suggesting that survey participants in late lockdown counties
16

actually decreased their portfolio share by more. Moreover, we find a decrease in the share of foreign assets
by 0.7 percentage points. Gold is often portrayed as a store of value and safety but only few households in
our sample have any savings in gold and no difference exists in portfolio shares across survey participants
by lockdown status. Panel B shows that no systematic variation exists in liquidity, that is, the ability to
cover an unexpected payment equal to one-month of income. This result is important because it indicates
that differentially binding financial constraints are an unlikely driving force for our spending results. We
also find no difference in financial wealth, that is, savings larger than one month of income, by lockdown
status. This null result is plausible because it is unlikely that the checking account balance, or the value of
stock and bond portfolios should be differentially affected by local lockdown conditions.

D. Macroeconomic expectations
To what extent do local lockdowns spill over to subjective expectations? After all, most economic decisions
are forward looking and therefore directly depend on individuals’ expectations. Moreover, the effectiveness
of fiscal and monetary policy measures crucially depend on the expectations of households (Bernanke,
2010) and Binder (2020) finds systematic revisions of GDP growth and inflation expectations due to news
about COVID. Ex-ante, it is unclear whether the COVID crisis will result in higher or lower inflation. On the
one hand, supply-chain disruptions could increase marginal costs and result in higher future inflation. On the
other hand, depressed demand as currently reflected in low oil prices could instead put downward pressure on
inflation. To shed more light on this matter, we first study the effect on inflation expectations and report results
in Table 8. During the binding lower bound on nominal interest rates, inflation expectations translate oneto-one into changes in real interest rates (Euler equation) which can directly impact current and future
consumption choices (Coibion et al. 2019, D’Acunto et al. 2016). We see in Panel A that survey participants
under lockdown have on average 0.5 percentage point lower inflation expectations over the next twelve
months. Lower inflation expectations imply higher perceived real interest rates which suggests additional
downward pressure on household consumption. Household consumption, however, responds not just to the
level of real interest rates but also to the dispersion in inflation expectations due to precautionary savings.
We use the distribution question for inflation expectations and create a measure of uncertainty in expected
inflation at the individual level as the standard deviation in one-year ahead expected inflation. Indeed, local
lockdowns increase the uncertainty for future inflation by more than half a percentage point which might
translate into increasing precautionary savings demand. These cross-sectional estimates for inflation
expectations and uncertainty are large and correspond to about 100% of the difference across survey waves
in Panel D of Table 1.
The remaining Panels of Table 8 study the perceptions of current unemployment and mortgage
rates as well as the expectations for the next 12 months, or the end of 2020 and 2021 and the longer horizon
17

(three to five years for unemployment and five to ten years for mortgage rates, respectively).
Unemployment rates are a key indicator for the state of the economy and mortgage rates are the key
transmission mechanism of monetary policy for many households and also directly shape the economic
recovery given the importance of housing for business cycles (Mian et al., 2017). The perceived
unemployment rate spikes up by more than 13 percentage points in lockdown counties and the expected
unemployment rate stays at elevated levels for the next 12 months and only slowly decreases to an increase
of 2 percentage points over the longer horizon (Panel B). These increases in cross-sectional estimates are
even larger than the aggregate increases in expectations that we document in Panel E of Table 1. Results
are similar in terms of persistence albeit slightly smaller in magnitude once we exclude extreme
observations with perceptions and expectations larger than 40% (Panel C). These expectations suggest a
rather sluggish and slow recovery, resembling a U shape in terms of recent policy discussions. As for
mortgage rates, we see survey participants perceive a decrease of about two-thirds of a percentage point
which persists until the longer horizon (Panel D). These expectations correspond to a level shift in the term
structure of mortgage rates and are also consistent with a depressed economy for an extended period of
time. Again, we find that the decrease in mortgage rates across counties is larger than the aggregate
decreases across survey waves (Panel G of Table 1).

E. Political outcomes
Finally, we study whether local lockdowns affect the qualitative rating of several government institutions
in Table 9 which we measure on a ten-point Likert scale with higher values reflecting higher approval
ratings. We only elicited approval ratings in the April wave of the survey which is why our two-stage least
squares estimation now exploits purely cross-sectional variation:
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = 𝜓𝜓 × 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂 × 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗 + 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 + 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒

𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽 × 𝕀𝕀�𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 > 0� + 𝛾𝛾 × 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗 + 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 + +𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒,

where we use the same notation as in equations (1) and (2) and both equations include state fixed effects.
U.S. officials increasingly refer to the pandemic as a war situation10 and typically, incumbents tend
to observe a surge in support during war times with possibly important implications for the upcoming
presidential elections. At the same time, the ‘current war’ also reflects a major economic hardship for many
individuals and we might expect support to decrease for the president during poor economic times. We see in
Table 9 that survey respondents in lockdown counties have a 6 point lower approval rating of the President
than other survey respondents on a ten-point scale. No heterogeneity exists for other government institutions

10

For example, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has noted, “This is a war, and we need to win this war and we
need to spend what it takes to win the war.”

18

(the Congress in row (2), the U.S. Treasury in row (3), the Federal Reserve in row (4)). The approval for the
U.S. Center for Disease Control in row (5), though, is 3 points higher for survey participants in lockdown.

VI

Conclusion

The arrival of the COVID19 pandemic resulted in major economic downturns around the world with large
drops in employment, equity markets, and personal income. To slow the spread of the pandemic, many
governments imposed restrictions in movements to slow the spread of the virus. We field large-scale
customized surveys on a representative US panel of households to document the extent of economic damage
and to study the impact of local lockdowns on realized and planned spending, income and wealth losses,
macroeconomic expectations and approval ratings of political institutions. We observe a dramatic decline
in employment and consumer spending as well as a bleak outlook for the next few years. Our estimates
suggest that this economic catastrophe can be largely accounted by lockdowns. Furthermore, because we
can only measure the immediate effect of lockdowns on labor markets and consumer spending, we likely
underestimate the economic costs of these policies as more firms would gradually go out of business and
more workers would be let go under continued lockdowns.
It is beyond the scope of this paper to establish whether this economic cost is sufficiently small to
justify lockdown policies that likely save many thousands of lives. However, our analysis should inform
policymakers about at least one part of the tradeoff they face because these costs are relevant in thinking
about how long to maintain lockdown policies, especially since the costs are likely increasing with duration.
The significant costs that we identify suggest that policymakers should be wary of focusing only on the
benefits of lockdown policies and not carefully weighing them against their costs. Our analysis should also
provide input for policies aimed to mitigate the consequences of the COVID recession. For example, we
document that many households effectively default on their debt payments and rents which can start a wave
of bankruptcies and evictions and thus delay the recovery. Low expectations for inflation and mortgage
interest rates will likely limit the power of monetary policy. While households expect normalcy to return
within six months, the ferocity and speed of this storm is such that the damage may be rather persistent. To
avoid adverse hysteresis-like scenarios, policymakers may have to consider less conventional measures
such as extended periods of fiscal stimulus, debt forgiveness, taking stakes in businesses (including
financial institutions), and more aggressive quantitative easing.

The duration of lockdown in your location, days

Notes: the survey question for the first variable is “How concerned are you about the effects that the coronavirus might have on the financial situation of your household? Please
choose from 0 (Not at all concerned) to 10 (Extremely concerned)”. The survey question for lost earnings is “Have you lost earnings due to coronavirus concerns?” and conditional
on responding “yes” the follow up question is “Could you provide an estimate of lost income? (Please round to the nearest dollar)”. This question is only asked for people who are
employed in the April wave of the survey. The survey question for lost financial wealth is “Have you lost any financial wealth due to coronavirus concerns?” and conditional on
responding “yes” the follow-up question is “Could you provide an estimate of lost wealth? (Please round to the nearest dollar)”. This question is asked only for people who reported
having financial wealth (excluding housing wealth) greater than his/her household’s one-month income. The duration of lockdown in your location is only asked for respondents
who reported to be a lockdown. The survey question is “How long do you think the lockdown in your location will last?”. Time before condition return to normal in your location is
asked for all respondents. The survey question is “How long do you think it will be before conditions return to normal in your location?”.
