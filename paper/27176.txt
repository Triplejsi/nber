Estimating Probabilities of Success of Vaccine and Other Anti-Infective Therapeutic Development
Programs

JEL No. C01,C13,I1,I11,I13,I15,I18,L65
ABSTRACT
A key driver in biopharmaceutical investment decisions is the probability of success of a drug
development program. We estimate the probabilities of success (PoSs) of clinical trials for
vaccines and other anti-infective therapeutics using 43,414 unique triplets of clinical trial, drug,
and disease between January 1, 2000, and January 7, 2020, yielding 2,544 vaccine programs and
6,829 nonvaccine programs targeting infectious diseases. The overall estimated PoS for an
industry-sponsored vaccine program is 39.6%, and 16.3% for an industry-sponsored antiinfective therapeutic. Among industry-sponsored vaccines programs, only 12 out of 27 disease
categories have seen at least one approval, with the most successful being against
monkeypox (100%), rotavirus (78.7%), and Japanese encephalitis (67.6%). The three
infectious diseases with the highest
PoSs
for
industry-sponsored
nonvaccine
therapeutics
are
smallpox
(100%), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (31.8%), and
onychomycosis (29.8%). Non-industry-sponsored vaccine and nonvaccine development
programs have lower overall PoSs: 6.8% and 8.2%, respectively. Viruses involved in
recent outbreaks—Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), Ebola, and Zika—have had a combined total of only 45 nonvaccine
development programs initiated over the past two decades, and no approved therapy to date. These
estimates offer guidance both to biopharma investors as well as to policymakers seeking to
identify areas most likely to be underserved by private sector engagement and in need of public
sector support.

1. Introduction
In this article, we provide estimates of the historical probabilities of success (PoSs) of
clinical trials for vaccines and other therapeutic drugs for infectious diseases to inform
discussions on the planning and financing of the fight against one of humanity’s oldest foes.
This is of particular importance in light of the recent havoc wreaked by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus
disease (COVID-19).
While the PoSs of therapeutic drugs for various disease groups like oncology are welldocumented (Abrantes-Metz et al., 2004; DiMasi et al., 2010; Hay et al., 2014; MIT Laboratory
for Financial Engineering, 2020; Smietana et al., 2016; Thomas et al., 2016; Wong et al.,
2019a, 2019b), relatively little has been published on treatments for infectious diseases and
vaccine development despite their importance (Davis et al., 2011; Pronker et al., 2013). Prior
studies have focused on narrower subsets relevant to their specific interests and have relied
on much more limited data sets. For example, Young et al. (2020) employed 10 to 25 data
points per estimated value from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to estimate the PoS
of vaccines for neglected diseases, and DiMasi et al. (2020) reported PoS estimates on a perdrug basis using 2,575 trials for diseases of interest to the Gates Foundation. In contrast, we
employ a much larger and broader data set of 16,328 unique clinical trials to estimate the
PoSs of vaccines and nonvaccine therapeutics targeting 29 different infectious diseases using
all available drug-indication pairs—a methodology that has been argued to be more relevant
for evaluating drug development R&D risk and productivity (Wong et al., 2019b).
Vaccination is commonly recognized as one of the most cost-effective public health
measures for combatting infectious diseases (André, 2002; Ehreth, 2003; Kieny & Girard,
2005; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2013; Pronker et
al., 2013; Rémy et al., 2015). In developed countries, routine prophylactic vaccination and
effective treatment options have led to the control or complete elimination of several deadly
infectious diseases through individual and herd immunity, preventing millions of deaths and
untold suffering each year. This prophylaxis dramatically reduces the burden on the health
care system and society as a whole. In addition, the deaths, hospitalizations, and treatment
costs avoided by these measures have led to significant economic savings (Ehreth, 2003;
Rémy et al., 2015; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2017).
As technology continues to advance, one expects that the human species will be better
able to cope with these diseases. The fact remains, however, that we still do not have effective
treatments or vaccines for many infectious diseases. While the discovery of antibiotics has
reduced the mortality rate of bacterial infection, and the development of the smallpox
vaccine has led to the eradication of the devastating disease (World Health Organization,
1980), other infectious diseases, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and
malaria, still take the lives of tens of millions every year. According to the World Health

Organization, there are currently only 26 infectious diseases that are preventable by
available vaccines (World Health Organization, 2020).
By developing better risk measures for therapeutic development, we hope to facilitate
greater investment, identification of underserved areas that require public sector support,
and more efficient business and financing models in this critical field.

2. Methods
We apply the method of Wong et al. (2019b) to estimate the PoSs of drug development
programs using historical clinical trial data. This method was also applied in Wong et al.
(2019a) to investigate the clinical success rates of oncology development programs. We
briefly describe this method, with parts reproduced from the aforementioned articles for
expositional convenience.
A drug development program, also known as a drug development path, is the clinical
investigation of the use of a drug for a disease. It typically consists of a sequence of clinical
trials, separated into three phases. Phase 1 trials test mainly the safety and tolerance of a
drug while phase 2 trials test the efficacy of the drug for a given indication. Phase 3 trials
attempt to confirm the drug’s efficacy for larger populations and against alternatives. Some
trials involve the combination of two phases into a single protocol, denoted `Phase 1/2' (a
combination of Phases 1 and 2) and `Phase 1/3' (a combination of Phases 2 and 3).
We say that a drug development program has reached phase i if it is observed, or can
be inferred, that there is at least one trial in phase i. It is possible that a clinical trial can be
repeated in multiple development paths. In Figure 1, we show an example in which a single
phase 1 trial for a drug is involved in four different development paths, each targeting a
different disease. It is not uncommon that the result of the phase 1 trial is used as supporting
evidence for the safe use of a drug, allowing that drug to be used for different indications
without additional phase 1 testing. For example, hydroxychloroquine — already approved
for the treatment of malaria — is being tested for effectiveness against COVID-19 without
another phase 1 clinical trial. There also exist clinical trials where different drug
combinations are tested for the same indication in different arms. Because of these
multiplicities, computing PoSs cannot be done simply by dividing the number of phase i+1
trials by the number of phase i trials for the same drug-indication pair — we need to identify
specific drug development paths.

Figure 1. We define a drug development path as the development of a drug for a specific indication. A single clinical trial can
belong to multiple drug development programs. We illustrate a hypothetical example where 4 drug development paths, all
using the same drug, share the same phase 1 clinical trial.

Specifically, we make the assumption that each program must transition from phase
1 to phase 2 to phase 3 to approval in this order, and model the possible states in a drug
development program as a Markov chain shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Observed and unobserved states in a drug development, from phase 1 to approval. A drug development is in phase i
if it has at least one trial in phase i. The `missing’ states represent phases where we do not observe any clinical trial in that
phase for the drug-indication pair, but where we know must have occurred. Every drug development path in our study must
start from phase 1 (or ‘missing’ phase 1) and end up in one of the nodes labeled as ‘in progress’, ‘terminated’ or ‘approval’.

We infer missing transitions in the development paths arising from incomplete
records. This is plausible since each of these stages involves distinct predefined tests, all of
which are required by regulators in any new drug application (NDA). If we observe data for
phases 1 and 3 but not phase 2 trials for a given drug-indication pair, our idealized process
implies that there was at least one phase 2 trial that occurred, but is missing from our dataset.
Accordingly, we impute the successful completion of phase 2 in these cases. There exist some

rare cases where phase 2 trials are skipped, as with the example of aducanumab (BIIB037),
Biogen’s Alzheimer’s candidate, as reported by Root (2014). Since skipping phase 2 trials is
motivated by compelling phase 1 data and is approved by the regulatory authorities,
imputing the successful completion of phase 2 trials in these cases to trace drug development
paths is a reasonable approximation. We make the standard assumption that phase 1/2 and
phase 2/3 trials are to be considered as phase 2 and phase 3, respectively.
We call the estimated probability of a drug development program transitioning from
phase i to phase i+1 the “phase i PoS”, and the “estimated overall PoS” is defined as the
estimated probability of a drug development program going from phase 1 to regulatory
approval in at least one country. To simplify terminology, we will henceforth omit the
qualifier “estimated” when referring to the PoS, so it should be understood that all PoS values
reported in this article are statistical estimates of unobservable population parameters.
The probability of a drug development program transitioning from phase i to phase j
(PoSij) can be computed using the simple ratio Nj/Ni, where Ni is the number of drug
development programs that have reached phase i (where i = 1, 2, 3) of the drug development
process and are not in active development between phase i and phase j (where j = 2, 3, or “A”
which denotes regulatory approval, i<j), and Nj is the number of drug development programs
among the former that made it to phase j. PoS1A is also known as the “overall PoS”. We
provide simple numerical examples in the Appendix (Section A1) to clarify our algorithms.
The estimated probability of a drug development program transitioning from phase
1 to approval—estimated directly using the method described above—is called the ‘path-bypath’ estimate of the overall PoS, and is reported for all PoS calculations. Our method of
inferring unobserved states and computing the PoS using the simple ratio defined above
applies to both vaccines and nonvaccine therapeutics. In fact, since it is common for vaccine
candidates to skip phase 1 and move directly to phase 2 or 3 based on initial safety of the
vaccine base (e.g., egg, etc.) after changing the virus within it, filling in unobserved phases
will lead to a more accurate PoS.
It should be emphasized that because of the treatment of in-progress drug
development programs, path-by-path PoS estimates are not multiplicative, i.e., PoS12 ×
PoS23 × PoS3A ≠ PoS1A . In contrast, the ‘phase-by-phase’ estimates used in prior studies
(DiMasi et al., 2010, 2020; Hay et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2016) do multiply, i.e.,
PoS12 × PoS23 × PoS3A = PoS1A . The latter two studies do not fill in unobserved clinical
development phases. We elaborate on the differences between the path-by-path and phaseby-phase methods in the Appendix (see Section A2).
We compute the path-by-path POS using an algorithm that recursively considers all
possible drug-indication pairs and determines the maximum observed phase. As the Markov
chain model implies, reaching phase i would imply that all prior phases were completed. To
determine if a drug development program has been terminated in the last observed phase

or is still ongoing, we use a simple heuristic: If the time elapsed between the end date of the
most recent phase i and the end of our sample exceeds a certain threshold ti, we conclude
that the trial has terminated. Based on practical considerations, we set ti, to be 360, 540, and
900 days for phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For example, we assume that it takes
approximately 6 months to prepare documents for an NDA filing after a phase 3 trial has
been completed. Since the FDA has a 6-month period to decide if it wishes to follow up on a
filing, and an additional 18 months to deliver a verdict, this places the overall time between
phase 3 and Approval to about 30 months, hence we set t3 = 900 days. Based on these criteria,
we will consider only drug development programs that have seen at least one trial with a
definite outcome in the PoS computations. More detailed exposition of and pseudo-code for
this algorithm can be found in Wong et al. (2019b).

3. Data
We extracted clinical trials metadata from the January 7, 2020, snapshots of Citeline’s
PharmaProjects and TrialTrove databases, provided by Informa Pharma Intelligence. These
data are widely available commercially as well as through an academic license. Clinical trial
metadata was retrieved from the TrialTrove database while the approval data was obtained
from the PharmaProjects database, both of which are required to identify the drug
development programs. In addition to incorporating multiple data streams, including nightly
feeds from official sources such as ClinicalTrials.gov, Citeline contains data from primary
sources such as institutional press releases, financial reports, study reports, and drug
marketing label applications, and secondary sources such as analyst reports by consulting
companies. Secondary sources are particularly important for reducing potential biases that
may arise from the tendency of organizations to report only successful trials, especially those
prior to the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 which requires all clinical trials to be registered
and tracked via ClinicalTrials.gov. These databases contain information from both US and
non-US sources. We consider a drug approved if it is approved in any country. All clinical
trials used in this analysis have end dates after January 1, 2000, and start dates before
January 7, 2020.
We filter our data to include only trials that have been tagged by Citeline as being in
the ‘Infectious Disease’ or ‘Vaccines (Infectious Diseases)’ therapeutic areas. The vaccine
types and diseases are provided by the databases. The database encodes each unique triplet
of trial identification number, drug, and disease as a data point. Therefore, a single trial may
appear as multiple data points. Since the two therapeutic areas may overlap in data points,
we define clinical trials that are involved in any vaccine development as part of a ‘vaccine’
development program. In addition, we process the data such that more specific diseases (e.g.,
rabies) can be identified instead of broad vaccine classes (e.g., vector-borne disease
vaccines). Clinical trials that are not involved in any vaccine development program will be
deemed to be part of a ‘nonvaccine’ drug development program. We derive 43,414 data

points in total. We define an ‘industry-sponsored’ development program as one where there
is at least one commercial company involved in any stage of clinical development. The
complement—in which there is no commercial company involved in any stage of the vaccine
or drug development program—shall be referred to as ‘non-industry-sponsored’. Given
these definitions, a drug or vaccine development program (and the clinical trials in the
program) can belong to only one of these mutually-exclusive sets: industry-sponsored
vaccines, industry-sponsored nonvaccine therapeutics, non-industry-sponsored vaccines,
and, non-industry-sponsored nonvaccine therapeutics.
The vaccines in TrialTrove are identified by broad categories such as “respiratory
vaccines,” “other viral vaccines,” or “hepatitis vaccines.” We attempt to infer the diseases
targeted by the vaccines by cross-referencing the disease tags for each clinical trial. For
example, a clinical trial may be tagged with both “hepatitis vaccines” and “HBV,” allowing us
to conclude that the vaccine is indicated for HBV (hepatitis B virus). Those clinical trials that
have only vaccine tags will have their disease labeled as “others.” Manual inspection of some
of the clinical trial titles shows that this category includes diseases such as measles and
tuberculosis.
We plot the number of development programs known to start in each month from
January 2000 through December 2019 in Figure 3. There are 1,838 and 706 industrysponsored and non-industry-sponsored vaccine development programs, respectively, and,
3,851 and 2,978 industry-sponsored and non-industry-sponsored nonvaccine drug
development programs targeting infectious diseases, respectively. As can be seen from
Figure 3a, the number of industry-sponsored clinical programs attempting to treat infectious
diseases is often greater than the number of vaccine development programs. We see a
precipitous fall in the number of infectious disease treatment development programs
initiated between late 2018 and mid-2019, which is likely to be related to declining
investment in the research and development (R&D) of novel antibiotics, precipitated by the
closure of antibiotics biotechnology firms and the withdrawal of pharmaceutical companies
from the antibiotics business (Hu, 2018; Langreth, 2019).
Between January 2000 and June 2011, the number of non-industry-sponsored
vaccine development programs initiated is on par with the number of non-industrysponsored, nonvaccine anti-infective drug development programs initiated (see Figure 3b).
However, the number of nonvaccine drug development programs initiated begin to outpace
the number of vaccine development programs after January 2012, and experience a rapid
boom between mid-2015 and mid-2018 before declining rapidly between October 2018 and
January 2019.

4. Results
4.1 Vaccines
Overall, 2,544 vaccine development programs are observed in our data set, of which
1,838 are sponsored by industry and 706 do not involve any industry sponsor in any stage
of development. For industry-sponsored drug development programs, respiratory infections
is the most actively researched vaccine category, comprising 34.8% (n = 640) of all vaccine
development programs (see Figure 4). HBV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
vaccines represent 11.6% (n = 213) and 9.8% (n = 181) of all vaccine development programs,

respectively, whereas intra-abdominal infections, monkeypox, and severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) vaccines are the least researched fields, with only one development path
observed per disease.
A similar pattern can be seen for the non-industry-sponsored vaccine development
programs; excluding the others category, the top three most researched vaccine categories
are also respiratory infections (24.8%), HIV (20.4%), and HBV (8.2%), whereas Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS are the least researched diseases with one
development program each.

From Table 1, we can see that the overall PoS for industry-sponsored vaccine
development programs is 39.6% (standard error, or SE = 1.2%), which is substantially higher
than the average overall PoS of 11.0% (SE = 0.2%) across all industry-sponsored drug
development programs (see Table 10 in the Appendix). These findings are largely in line with
the results of Wong et al. (2019b), who first observed this trend, and of DiMasi et al. (2020),
despite the fact that the latter computed their estimates using a different method (a “phaseby-phase” approach) and considered only lead indications. We estimate PoS12, PoS23, and
PoS3A to be 82.5% (SE = 0.9%), 65.4% (SE = 1.3%), and 80.1% (SE = 1.4%), respectively.
Across all industry-sponsored vaccine development programs, we can see that
monkeypox vaccines have had the most developmental success, followed by rotavirus and
Japanese encephalitis vaccines (see Table 1). Their overall success rates are 100% (SE =
0.0%), 78.7% (SE = 5.2%), and 67.6% (SE = 8.0%), respectively. The overall PoS for
monkeypox is based on only one sample. Only 12 diseases out of the 27 disease categories
with at least one development path observed have seen at least one approved vaccine.

37.3% (SE = 2.6%), and 39.8% (SE = 4.9%), respectively (Table 2). The top three indications
with the highest overall success rates for non-industry-sponsored drug development
programs are otitis media (28.6%, SE = 17.1%), rabies (25.0%, SE = 10.8%), and Japanese
encephalitis (25.0%, SE = 21.7%). The latter estimates are derived from only a handful of
samples and must be interpreted with caution as their large standard errors suggest.

4.2 Nonvaccine Anti-Infective Therapeutics
In contrast to vaccines, which are intended to prevent disease, a number of
alternatives have been developed to treat—and, in some cases, cure—patients afflicted with
an infectious disease. According to our data set, 3,851 and 2,978 industry-sponsored and
non-industry-sponsored nonvaccine drug development programs, respectively, have been
initiated in the area of infectious disease (see Figure 5). The top three diseases with the
greatest number of industry-sponsored drug development programs are respiratory
infections (21.8%), HIV (15.7%) and hepatitis C virus, or HCV (14.1%). Together, they
comprise 51.6% of all industry-sponsored nonvaccine development programs. Non-industry
anti-infectious-disease drug development programs focus on treating respiratory infections
(20.5%), HIV (13.9%), and bacterial skin infection (12.1%).
With respect to addressing the most recent virus outbreaks—MERS, SARS, Ebola, and
Zika—a total of nine industry-sponsored and 36 non-industry-sponsored nonvaccine drug

From Table 3, we can see that the overall PoS across all industry-sponsored drug
development programs treating infectious diseases is 16.3% (SE = 0.7%). The PoS12, PoS23,
and PoS3A are 65.0% (SE = 0.8%), 64.3% (SE = 1.0%), and 51.1% (SE = 1.6%), respectively.
Based on our data, the highest success rates for industry-sponsored nonvaccine

development programs have been for smallpox (100.0%, SE = 0.0%), cytomegalovirus (CMV)
infection (31.8%, SE = 7.0%), and onychomycosis (29.8%, SE = 6.7%). There are currently
no nonvaccine therapies approved for rotavirus, SARS, rabies, Ebola, West Nile virus,
Marburg, yellow fever, chikungunya, MERS, monkeypox, or norovirus. With the exception of
norovirus and MERS, these diseases without any vaccine are predominantly prevalent in
nonindustrialized nations, and thus represent neglected diseases. It is also interesting that
for the latter eight diseases, even the PoS12 is low. Since phase 1 trials in the development of
anti-infective therapies focus primarily on safety, understanding the pharmacokinetics of the
compound, and maximum tolerable dose levels, it can be inferred that the drugs tested are
either of high toxicity or lack the necessary characteristics required for optimal absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ODME), or perhaps failed to advance due to
financial constraints.

5. Industry-Sponsored Development Programs
In an attempt to shed more light on the industry-sponsored vaccine and nonvaccine
drug development programs, we classify the diseases by their biological family and
transmission type. The classifications are presented in Table 9 in the Appendix. We then
compute the PoSs using these classifications.
Looking at the vaccine PoSs by transmission route (see Table 5), we see that vaccines
for diseases transmitted through animal bites have the highest overall PoS (61.3%, SE =
4.7%), whereas no vaccine has been developed for diseases transmitted through
contaminated food or water.

We find that companies have been most successful in developing nonvaccine
treatments for diseases transmitted between humans through the air, with 50.0% (SE =
25.0%) of all drug development programs making it from phase 1 to regulatory approval
(see Table 6). Unfortunately, this is based on only four drug development programs and may
not be indicative of the general trend. Treatments for diseases that transmit through ‘human
to human (others)’ have an overall PoS of 21.5% (SE = 1.2%) while no approval is observed
for diseases transmitted through ‘animal bites’ or ‘contaminated food or water’.

When we classify the vaccines by the biological family of the infectious agent (Table
7), we see that reoviridae (e.g., rotavirus), rhabdoviridae (e.g., rabies), and hepadnaviridae
(e.g., HBV) are the three biological families with the highest overall PoSs for vaccines at
78.7%, (SE = 5.2%), 66.7% (SE = 7.5%), and 53.7% (SE = 3.6%), respectively. We have yet to
see a vaccine for diseases caused by agents in the biological families of retroviridae (e.g., HIV),
caliciviridae (e.g., norovirus), clostridiaceae (e.g., clostridium difficile), coronaviridae (e.g.,
SARS, MERS), herpesviridae (e.g., CMV infection), or togaviridae (e.g., chikungunya).

When we consider nonvaccine PoSs by biological family of the infectious agent (see
Table 8), we see that nonvaccine therapies for poxviridae (e.g., smallpox), herpesviridae (e.g.,
CMV infection), and hepadnaviridae (e.g., HBV) have the highest overall PoS at 66.7% (SE =
27.2%), 31.8% (SE = 7.0%), and 29.5% (SE = 4.0%), respectively. For viruses in the
reoviridae (e.g., rotavirus), coronaviridae (e.g., SARS, MERS), caliciviridae (e.g., norovirus),
rhabdoviridae (e.g., rabies), and togaviridae (e.g., chikungunya) families, there have been less
than five development programs each, and no approved treatment.

6. Discussion
Companies producing vaccines and other therapeutics for infectious diseases have
gradually been retreating from these spaces in recent years. The number of companies
producing vaccines has dwindled over the past few decades, and the top four vaccine
companies now make up more than 90% of the global market (Evaluate, 2018). Similarly,
the top four companies producing antiviral drugs occupy about 80% of the global market
(Evaluate, 2018). Antibiotic developers such Achaogen and Melinta Therapeutics have filed
for bankruptcy in the past year, while large pharmaceutical companies such as Novartis and
Sanofi have withdrawn from the space (Jacobs, 2019), leading the Infectious Diseases Society
of America to sound the alarm about the availability of effective antibiotics (Infectious
Diseases Society of America, 2019).
It should be no surprise that investors are unwilling to invest in companies producing
vaccines and treatments for infectious diseases given the economics of this market (Vu et al.,
2020). These have been generally regarded as low-margin products, and they have low
expected growth potential compared to chronic treatments in other therapeutic areas, such
as oncology or cardiovascular diseases. For example, Merck’s oncology assets are estimated
to have contributed $11.8 billion in incremental revenues from 2017 to 2020; for the same
period, the incremental contribution of its vaccines portfolio is estimated to be $2.7 billion
(Trefis, 2020). And Merck is the second largest vaccine maker in the world. This lack of
investment has resulted in a relatively low number of development programs for vaccines
and treatments of infectious diseases; only 10.4% of all industry-sponsored drug
development programs launched in the past two decades are in these areas (see Table 10 in
the Appendix).
Our study indicates that the technical success rate is unlikely to be a barrier to
investments in new vaccines and treatments for infectious diseases, unlike cancer drugs,
where the financial risk of new R&D projects comes from the reduced chance of bringing a
drug-indication pair from phase 1 to market. The overall PoS of industry-sponsored vaccines
and treatments for infectious diseases are above the average for all therapeutic groups (see
Table 10 in the Appendix).
It is often suggested that the fundamental issue behind this lack of investment is that
the market for vaccines and treatments for infectious diseases is simply not lucrative enough.
Despite the expense of research and development and the need for large-scale production
(Weir & Gruber, 2016), anti-infective disease treatments are used only occasionally, while
vaccine companies face an avalanche of liability lawsuits (Hensley & Wysocki, 2005).
Furthermore, the companies are at the mercy of government pricing decisions (Hu, 2018).
Apart from financial considerations, the dearth of vaccines and other treatments for
infectious diseases may be due to the lack of available subjects for testing these therapeutics,
especially during non-epidemic periods. This may be alleviated by having faster preclinical

and clinical pathways in cases of severe infectious diseases with no existing treatments. One
such pathway is the Animal Rule (FDA Approval of New Drugs When Human Efficacy Studies
Are Not Ethical or Feasible, 2019; FDA Approval of Biological Products When Human Efficacy
Studies Are Not Ethical or Feasible, 2019) whereby the "FDA may grant marketing approval
based on adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies when the results of those
studies establish that the drug is reasonably likely to produce clinical benefit in humans”
(FDA, 2015). This has been used to approve smallpox and monkeypox vaccines, and can be
expanded for the investigation of therapeutics for other potentially deadly infectious
diseases with low incidence rates, such as SARS.
Even though this pathway can expedite the development of vaccines and antiinfective treatments, it still requires considerable development time as one needs to
establish the equivalence of the drug mechanism between animal models and humans. While
it is desirable to hasten the development of vaccines and medical product during an epidemic,
biological breakthroughs and science will ultimate drive the efficiency of our ability to fight
pandemics of novel pathogens.
It remains to be seen if more non-industry-sponsored research can alleviate the issue.
Our study shows that only 6.8% (SE = 1.0%) and 8.2% (SE = 0.6%) of non-industrysponsored vaccines and nonvaccine infectious disease development programs transition
from phase 1 to approval, respectively. However, this may be a result of selection bias:
promising vaccine and therapeutics initiated in non-industry settings are often pursued in
conjunction with industry-sponsored sponsors, whereas commercially less promising
projects are more likely to be pursued by non-profit organizations.

7. Conclusion
The world today has never been in greater need of effective vaccines and other antiinfectives. As the COVID-19 crisis has shown, infectious diseases still have the potential to
cause a catastrophically large number of deaths and disrupt the daily lives of billions. We
hope that our research into the probability of successfully developing infectious disease
therapeutics will inform all the stakeholders and catalyze innovation and greater investment
in this critical and underserved field.

Appendix
A1. An example of the path-by-path PoS calculations
For clarity, we will walk our readers through some calculations using the example
shown in Figure 6. In that figure, we see that 768 vaccine programs have conducted phase 1
testing whereas 1,178 vaccine programs have skipped phase 1 to go to phase 2 or 3 testing
directly. This is not uncommon in vaccine development programs, where vaccine candidates
move directly to the higher phases based on initial safety of the vaccine base (egg, etc.) after
changing the virus within it. Among these 1,946 vaccine development programs, we know
that 108 have yet to conclude phase 1 testing while 1,838 have completed phase 1. Of these
1,838 programs, 1,517 have gone on to phase 2 while 321 have failed. In the notation
introduced earlier, N1= 1,838 and N2=1,517, yielding an estimate of 1,517/1,838, or 82.5%,
for PoS12. Repeating the logic for the transitions between phase 2 and phase 3, and between
phase 3 and approval, gives 65.4% and 80.1% as estimates of PoS23 and PoS3A respectively.
In order to compute the probability of a vaccine development program making it all
the way from phase 1 to approval, we consider only the vaccine development programs that
have definite outcomes. In other words, we do not consider development programs that are
‘in progress’ in the denominator. In our example, the number of such programs is 1,178+768108-178-108 = 1,552. Since 615 programs made it to approval, the estimated PoS 1A is
615/1552 = 39.6%.

development programs.

A2. Differences between the path-by-path approach and the phase-by-phase approach
The path-by-phase approach described in the main text carefully considers the drug
development programs that are under active development and excludes them from the PoS
calculations when necessary. As such, the overall probability of success, PoS1A, is not the
multiplication of PoS12, PoS23 and PoS3A.
PoS1𝐴 (path-by-path) ≠ PoS12 × PoS23 × PoS3A
In contrast, the phase-by-phase computation simply computes PoSij using the
equation:
PoS𝑖𝑗 =

∏

𝑃𝑜𝑆𝑥,𝑥+1

𝑥=𝑖,…,𝑗−1

In particular, the PoS1A is computed using the following formula:
PoS1𝐴 (phase-by-phase) = PoS12 × PoS23 × PoS3A
The phase-by-phase approach is valid under some circumstances, such as when one
does not have any development programs that are active in any of the phases in his database.
This is easily seen if one simply set the number of ‘in progress’ development programs in all
phases in Figure 6 to zero and recomputing the PoS.
The path-by-path approach can also obtain the same results as the phase-by-phase
approach if one is willing to make an additional assumption: programs that are “in progress”
in phase i will transit to phase i+1 or to “terminated” with the same probability as going from
phase i to phase i+1, or from phase i to “terminated”, without “in progress” programs.
We will illustrate this with Figure 7, which shows the different states of a drug
development program with hypothetical transitions from “in progress” states to the next
phase or to the “terminated” state. Without considering “in progress” programs, the
probability of transiting from phase 1 to phase 2 is 78.0/(78.0+16.5) = 82.5% and the
probability of transiting from phase 1 into the “terminated” state is 17.5%. Similarly, without
considering “in progress” programs between phase 2 and phase 3, or phase 3 to Approval,
the probabilities of transiting from phase 2 to phase 3, or phase 3 to approval are 65.4% and
80.0% respectively. If we set a, b and c to be 82.5%, 65.4% and 80.0% respectively, we will
obtain a PoS1A of 43.2%, which is exactly PoS12 × PoS23 × PoS3A . In contrast, the path-bypath approach obtains a PoS1A of 39.6% as it does not make any assumptions and ignores
programs that are “in progress” in either phase 1, phase 2 or phase 3.
We believe that our method of inferring unobserved clinical development stages and
then applying the path-by-path approach is a better measure of the PoSs of clinical
development programs as it does not underestimates the PoSs, and makes no assumption
about the programs that are in active development.

We reproduce the probability of success across all therapeutic groups.
Table 10. The probabilities of success (PoSs) of industry-sponsored drug development programs across all therapeutic groups.
The classification of vaccines used in this table is based on broader categories such as ‘other viral vaccines’ instead of the finer
ones such as ‘ebola’ used in this paper, resulting in a slight difference in the computed PoSs. A: regulatory approval; P1: phase
1; P2: phase 2; P3: phase 3; SE = standard error.
