ECONOMETRICS AND THE DESICN OF ECONOMIC REFORM

ABSTRACT

The concepr of Economic Reform ia described as a planned shift from one,
Pareto inefficient, but quasi-stable, equilibrium (or 'trap') to a new Pareto
superior equilibrium which is, or is designed to become, stable too.

The

stabilization programs, with special

reference to Israel, where the economy was credibiy shifted from a 3-digit
inflationary process with considerable inertia, to relative price stability

with higher real growth, at only small adjustment costs, by means of a
'heterodox' plan.

This two-pronged stabilization program consisted of a

substantial correction of budget and external account 'fundamentals'
together with a synchronized, wage-price-exchange rate freeze.

The idea

is theoretically rationalized within a simple dual equilibrium inflation
model, for which some econometric estimates are also given.

By the end of the 1970's the whole area of eccnomic polic3
design had certainly reached a much more sophisticated phase (at
least in its theoretical approach,
less so in empirical

implementability) than was originally set out by Tinbergen a
quarter of a century earlier. However, it had one major drawback.
The policy maker in most of policy designs was an omnipotent
government much like the control theory vision of the economy as
a dumb machine planned and run by a clever engineer to achieve a
well defined objective.

The major agents in the economy, as we all know, talk back tc
the government. Unlike the dumb machine they can incorporate

anticipated government action into their rules of behaviour, a
fact that a policy designer has to take into account. Tinhergec
in his writings of the 1950's was well aware of the problem of
policy design when "there is more than one policy maker" and ever
analyzed an example of government versus the trade unions in a
game-like situation to which we shall come back in our subsequent
discussion (see "Centralization and Decentralization in Government
1954). This line, however, was not seriously and

its origins in Huth

Equilibrium trap and Economic Reform

It is in the spirit of both of these later developments that
would now like to take up one sub-class of policy designs
that of economic reforms. Let me again turn back to Tinbergen
for definitions.
He distinguished among three types of policy
changes varying by the degree of change in the underlying policy
structure. First, quantitative policy constitutes a quantitative
change in given instruments of policy (e.g., changes in tax
rates). Next comes his definition of a qualitative policy change,
which is a change in structure keeping the foundation intact
(e.g., a change in the type of taxes implemented). Finally there
is economic reform, "being equivalent to changes in foundations"
Again using Tinbergen's words (1956) "changes in more fundamental
features of social organizations are the most far-reaching types
of policy". What is sometimes called a 'regime change' also falls
under the same heading.

One conventional, or 'orthodox', element in these programs
was an attempted reduction in the government deficit (coupled with

fundamentals is all that the government should have been required
to do, implying that the market would do the rest of the
adjustment to a lower inflation rate. Yet in all three cases
there was another major, though less conventional, element (and
one that had earned these episodes the term 'heterodox' programs)
an attempt at a synchronized exchange rate, wage and price
freeze. In the case of Israel it took the form of an explicit
social contract between the three major parties to an incomes
policy package - the trade unions, the employers' association and
the government. What is the theoretical rationale for such a step?

polacy design and moreover, to convince one' s colleagues in the
profession, there is obvious need for a more firm theoretical
grounding. This is particularly true when controversial policy
measures such as a wage and price freeze (including temporary
price controls) are involved, While I am not certain that the
following will eventually prove an adequate (let alone the only)
way of going about the theoretical problem, I will here attempt a
sketch of the basic idea, which is an offshoot of work that I have

Multiple Inflationary Equilibria and Their Stability

The design of a stabilization program that we are discussing
here involves two major components - the removal of the source of

first,

In order co tackle both these questions I will
extend an
analytical framework based on deficit finance by money and bonds
which Stanley Fischer and I have used in an earlier empirical
paper (1986) and whose theoretical
properties weredeveloped
in other papers (1984, 1987).
The underlying idea, which in itself is not new,
is that a
given amount of seigniorage revenue can be collected at either
high or low rates of inflation [see Sargent and Wallace (1984),
and Liviatan (1984)].
The dual equilibria - a reflection of the
Laffer curve - imply that an economy may be stuck in a high
inflation equilibrium when, with the same relative budget deficit,
it could be at a lower inflation rate.

one unstable while the roles are reversed for the
case of rapid

Evans and yarrow )l98l); and mruno and Fischer (1984)].
The novel
and more interesting model to be suggested here, however, is the
empirically relevant non-linear case in which adjustment of a key
variable like the exchange rate (and therefore wages ahd prices)
is adaptive with coefficient of adjustment that itself rises with
the
rate of
inflation. In this case both equilibria could turn
out to be stable for some parameter values.
This has

It is important to point out that the only rationale for the

the adjustment of some nominal variable.
The adaptive expectation
assumption on prices is thus only given for illustration purposes.
Very similar results are obtained on the assumption of rational
expectations when friction comes from lagged adjustment of money
balances )see Bruno and Fischer, 1987) or from the fiscal lag (see

Dynamics of Inflation in the Open Economy

To make the argument of the previous section applicable to
the case at hand let us reinterpret lte for an open economy to be

represented by the rate of devaluation (e = &), on the
assumption
that
the
actual
adjustment of the exchange rate by the
authorities, which is also the rationally expected rate of
devaluation, follows a crawling peg rule, in which the rate of
devaluation is adjusted (other than through shocks - see below( to
the lag between the rate of wage inflation (w( and the rate of
devaluation:

we now apply the accounting framework presented in Section
III to the Israeli inflation data,'3>
in an attempt to
account
for the main components of the stepwise shifts in the inflation
rate into and out of the high inflation period.
The issue of
stability will he taken up in the next section.

Table 2 gives figures on the budget deficit and its finance

of
foreign exchange)

fluctuations to be traced primarily to the tax revenue side.
Secondly we note the sharp drop in the share of finance from the
domestic debt issue since 1983 and its replacement by foreign
exchange sales, evidence of the loss of confidence after the bank
share crisis of 1983, with e partial rebound in the first half of
1985
(mainly sales of a foreign exchange linked domestic asset,
PATAM, as part of the speculative move into a foreign exchange
linked hedge,
in addition to straight foreign exchange outflow)
Third and last we note again the sharp drop in the deficit in the
course of 1985
(already noted in Table 1) and the very marked
change in the composition of finance,
mainly between money and

Table 3 applies the framework of equation (4) to the
inflation profile and budget finance data over a 20 year period in
which inflation increased in stepwise fashion from 5 to 400
percent per annum. This is a comparative dynamics exercise. For
each sub—period we calculate the difference between the deficit

the theory of
I believe s potential explanation lies with
dual inflationary equilibria and the possibility that in those
years tne eoonomy was on the move to an inefficient, high
inflation equilibrium of the type B' (Figure A). First we note
that with an annual inflation rate of 141 percent (7 percent
monthly) the elasticity of demand for money may have passed the
unitary, 'optimal', inflation point, or was very close to it. If
the net injection ratio of 219 is any indioation of the long—run
equilibrium inflation at that time, it certainly satisfied the
high level equilibrium characteristics (the inflation rate
certainly did in the subsequent period) . We shall argue below
that the stability properties of the high inflation equilibrium
were also consistent with such an argument.

(in line 7) or 11 and 385 (in line 8) together with the pair 13.4

injection ratio only under a multiple equilibria interpretation.
But if at that point the economy was at a high inflation
equilibrium, and if, in fact, that was a potentially stable
equilibrium, then it is no wonder that a fall in the budget

synchronization of nominal magnitudes at a credible low rate of
devaluation and wage-price inflation, could shift the economy to

an even higher rate of inflation (e.g., from B' to B). This in

deficit ratio (and even more so in the net injection ratio) was
only marginal, yet the fall in the inflation rate was dramatic.
It can only be explained as a shift back from a high inflation

lines of dynamic adjustment given in Section IV, to which we
shall return below.

between the countries without an analogous detailed empirical
comparison.22> Let us now turn back to more general remarks.
We have used the example of a recent 'shock' stabilization
program to illustrate the way the concept of economic reform can
be placed within acceptable theoretical and empirically testable
frameworks.
Even our particular example still has to be worked
out more fully.

multiple stable equilibria for the economy and given a dear

consists of a shift from one stable or quasi-stable equilibrium,
