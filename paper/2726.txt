TRADE DEPENDENCY,

BANCALNING AND EXTERNAL DEBT

ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the factors determining the effective payment on outstanding debt
in the presence of partial defaults, and the feasibility of renewed investment. We show

that the bargaining outcome, which determines the repayment, is dictated by the trade
dependency, as measured by the substitutability of domestic and foreign products. A
higher relative size of sectors with lower substitutability between domestic and foreign

products will increase the trade dependency of the nation, reducing its bargaining
power arid thereby increasing the resource transfer ceiling. The resultant increase in
the ceiling makes the nation less risky, increasing the willingness of creditors to lend.
Thus, while a strategy of outward growth has the cost of increasing trade dependency,
it has the benefit of increasing the availability of external finance. Even with a partial
default, investment in highly trade dependent sectors with high productivity may be
warranted. This investment can be implemented by a marginal relief of the present
debt service, in exchange for investment in the proper sector. Following such a scheme
may require a detailed conditionality as well as careful monitoring. A way to partially
overcome some of

the monitoring problemsis through direct investment.

INTRODUCTIONAND SUMMARY

international credit market is presently characterized by the partial default
of several Latin American nations and other developing countries. The partial default
has triggered rounds of bargaining regarding the effective repayment called for. This
bargaining has yielded refinancing packages that come with certain conditionalities
attached to them. Recently much attention has been given to the viability of various
smart financing schemes to deal with these problems, as well as to the incentive
problems generated by the partial default. Such literature has taken the view that the
The

obstacle to complete default is the presence of default costs stemming from potential
embargos on temporal and intertemporal trade (i.e., embargos on trade in goods and

trade in assets)1

that the default costs are exogenous. While such
an assumption is justified in the short run, in the intermediate run the costs of defaults
are endogenously determined by a nations trade dependency. This, in turn, is influenced
by the investment policies of the country. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the
lrnkages between trade dependencyand investment policy. We wish to investigate the
consequence of investment policy on the bargaining power of each party, and tO study
the role of conditonalty attached to renewed credit. Specifically, we would like to
identify conditions under which renewed marginal resource transfer would be beneficial

for both parties, and to understand the role of conditionality and direct investment in
generating more favorablegrowth prospects for the developing nations.
We consider an asymmetric world economy composed of two blocks of nations,
the developing and the developed countries. The developed nations are characterized by
a relative abundance of capital, implying that the return on capital in these developed
countries tends to be lower than that in developing countries. Consequently, country
risk considerations aside, developing countries offer more attractive investment
opportunities. Another important characteristic of the developed natons is lower trade
dependency (relative to that of the developing).
A minimal model that allows the derivation of endogenous trade dependency is a
multi sectors, two periods model, in which the credit market behaves competitively in
the absence of default. However, a large initial debt overhang may motivate a partial
default by the developing countries. The partial default will then initiate negotiations
between the two blocks of nations over the effective repayment. The threat associated

with such bargaining is that in the absence of an agreement no international trade will
occur. We apply this threat to derive the bargaining outcome by using the Nash fixed
threat bargaining framework. Therefore, the bargaining outcome over the effective
repayment is determined by the trade dependency of the nations involved. We
investigate the factors determining the bargaining outcome, and identify conditions
under which there exist opportunitiesfor Pareto imprOving investment, whose return
will be paid in the second period. In order to focus on the endogenous determination of
the trade dependency of the developing nations, we assume that such nations can
produce their final output using several technologies with different degrees of
substitutability between foreign and domestic intermediate products. Thus, the trade

dependencyof developing nations is endogenously determined by the investment in the
various sectors.
The bargaining outcome defines the resource transfer ceiling and therefore
determines under which conditions we will switch from a competitive to a bargaining

-3equilibrium. The resultant rule is simple: if the resource transfer due to initial debt
exceeds the resource transfer supported by the bargaining outcome, the country will
choose to default partially, switching from the competitive to the bargaining allocation.
We demonstrate that the bargaining outcome is determined by the relative size of

the various sectors. A higher relative size of the sector with lower substitutability
between foreign and domestic intermediate products will increase the trade dependency
of the nation, reducing its bargaining power and thereby increasing the resource
transfer ceiling. The resultant increase in the ceiling makes the nation less risky,
increasing the willingness of creditors to lend. Thus, although a strategy of outward
growth has the cost of increasing trade dependency, it has the benefit of increasing the
availability of external finance.
With substantial initial debt overhang we will observe partial defaults and the
elimination of voluntary resource transfers from the developed to the developing
countries. We analyze the conditions under which renewed marginal resource transfer
to the developing countries may occur. If there are no ways to commit the developing
nations to follow a specified investment plan, no new marginal resource transfer will
occur. The reason for this is that as long as we operate in the bargaining region, the
repayment is dictated by the bargaining outcome. From the point of view of the
developing nations it will be advantageous to apply any investment towards reducing
their trade dependency. Such an investment will be beneficial for the developed
countries for two reasons: first, the developing nations will reap the standard
productivity gains; second, the drop in trade dependency will allow them to cut the
resources transferred to the developed nations. Obviously, the interests of the developed
nations will be served by minimin rig investment in projects that reduce the trade
dependency.

Under plausible conditions it may be beneficial for both blocks of nations to renew
marginal resource transfers, under the condition of targeting the investment in projects
that will increase the trade dependency of the developing countries. Such an

We show that a strategy of reducing the resource transfer from the developing
nations today, in exchange for an equivalent increase in investment in the sectors that
are highly trade dependent, and the return in the future to the bargaining repayment,
will benefit the developing countries. Nevertheless, this strategy is only the second best
investment

will

the developing nations may choose, since their interests are best served by
targeting the investment to sectors that are less trade dependent, and thereby reducing
their trade dependency. Hence, the fact that the developing nations will benefit from
investment n trade dependent sectors does not negate the need to impose conditionality
one

to ensure the proper investment.
From

the eyes of the developed nations, they are trading off the marginal drop

of

repayment today against the increase in repayment tomorrow. If the increase n future
repayment is large enough, the developed nations will be better off. If the marginal
productivity of capital in the developing nations is high enough, the beneficial effect
associated with the increase in future repayment generated by the investment in the
trade dependent sector will justify a renewed resource transfer (subject to the
appropriate conditionality).
A way to alleviate the monitoring problems associated with the conditionality,is
to execute the renewed resource transfer through a direct investment. Such an
investment will be targeted to the proper sectors. Consequently, the move to a
bargaining regime brought about by a partial default emphasizes the importance of
direct investment as one of the few remaining channels for external finance of new
investments. In this respect, it is interesting to trace the path of net direct private
investment in recent years. Findings indicate that the volume of private direct
investment in the seven major borrowers2 remains significant even in recent years,

-5and the partial default of these countries did not deter marginal investment3.
Obviously, the relative importance of direct investment as a channel for external
finance has increased drastically due to the reduction of all other channels. Thus, even
in the presence of partial defaults, selective direct investment may be advantageous for
both parties.
This paper suggests

that greater attention should be given to

policies

that

encourage selective direct investment as a way to overcome the incentive problems
generated by partial defaults. These incentive problems leave few options for the
renewal of external finance for investment. The developing countries can choose either
to accept detailed conditionality attached to the finance of new investments, or to
tolerate direct private investment. In the first case, the conditionality provides the
framework for monitoring. In the latter, the private investor does the monitoring
himself, by choosing the investment projects. While none of these options may be
enthusiastically endorsed by the developing nations, they represent the few remaining
channels for external finance for renewed investment.
Defore turning to the paper it is constructive to place it in its proper context in
the existing literature. The incentive problems facing new investment in the presence of
partial defaults have been analyzed by Krugman (1987), Froot (1988) and other. The
bargaining process determining the repayment on external debt is the topic of the
Bulow and Rogoffs 1987 contribution. The present paper addresses the strategic role of
conditionality and the incentive problems facing new investment in a multi-goods

1. THE MODEL

We describe

the model by reviewing the production side, the preferences and the

budget constraints.
1.1

PRODUCTION

International trade is trade in intermediate products, whose assembly to the final
good is location specific. Consequently, final goods are non-traded4. The final good can be
either consumed or invested domestically to increase the future capital stock. For

example, consider the following production function

and

where X and Y are the two types of intermediate products (domestic and foreign) and
KE is the capital stock. Note that the elasticity of substitution between the intermediate
products is given by 1/(1—s). Our analysis will demonstrate that this elasticity is a
useful measure of trade dependency: a lower value will be shown to correspond with a
greater trade dependency. The term h€ is a technological coefficient. We assume that

the developing countries are more trade dependent relative to the developed nations,
and that they face a choice regarding their trade dependency. Henceforth we will refer
to the sector producing ZE as sector

a framework similar to Ethier (1982). In Ethiers
model the gains from trade stem from 'international" returns to scale. These scale
economics are the result of an increase division of labor (and other inputs) due to the
rise in the market size.

access to a production technology that allows perfect substitutability between the
various intermediate products, with E = 1. We normalize productivity such that the
productivity coefficient for the developing country is unity (hence h€=i = 1). To focus on
the role of substitution flexibility in determining the trade dependency, we suppose that
all technologies share the same capital intensity (thus all have the same

We now focus our attention on

the characterization of the global equilibrium.

-92. THE EQUILIBPJUM

We study the global equilibrium by first analyzing the characteristics of the
bargaining equilibrium. This equilibrium will occur if the level of initial debt is large
enough. An understanding of the bargaining equilibrium allows us to precisely define
threshold level of debt that will trigger both a partial default and will move us to

the
the

bargaining outcome. And by understanding the bargaining outcome we can easily
characterize the propertiesof the competitiveequilibrium.
2.1. THE BARGAINING REGIME

Suppose

that we start period one with a large initial debt due to be paid to the

developed nations, whose value is large enough to motivate a partial default. A partial

default will initiate a renegotiations between the two blocks of nations. The threat
associatedwith such bargaining is that in the absence of an agreement no international
trade will occur. The bargaining outcome over the effective repayment is derived by the
Nash fixed threat bargaining framework6. We review the bargaining solution in two
steps. First, we identify the allocations that are Pareto efficient (the contract curve).
Next, we identify the bargaining solution by finding the trading point on the contract
curve that maximizes the product of the gains from trade for both blocks of nations.

For a discussion regarding the Nash fixed threat bargaining framework see
Nash (1950) and Roth (1979). The solution of this bargaining problem is obtained by the
allocation that maximizes the products of the trade gains for each party (relative to the

Such a level is determined by the rates of time preference, as given by (p,p*). In order
for further investment to equate the marginal product across the two blocks of nations,
capital mobility will be required Our analysis in section 3 will more closely examine
the potential role of investment in the presence of partial default.

2.2.2 THE DEFAULT DECISION

It is noteworthy that since X and '{ are perfect substitutes in the production
process of the developed nations, a free trade, competitive equilibrium is characterized
by a unitary terms of trade. Let us denote by R the resources- to be transferred to the
developed nations due to existing debt (a negative value of R will correspond to a
resource transfer to the developing countries). In the absence of default, the exports of
the developing nations finance the imports and the transfer to the developed nations:

to a competitive allocation in which the resource transfer is given by Rb = 2Xb - 1. The
term Rb defines the effectiveceiling on repayment: if the repayment due exceeds Rb the
developing nations will prefer to default partially, arid will transfer only Rb.
Consequently, one can view Xb as the key variable in determining the smooth
functioning of the international credit market.

larger Xb is associated with a world
system that will allow greater capital flows from the developing to the developed
countries.

2.2.3. THE BARGAINING EQUILIBRIUM

We now turn to the characterization of the bargaining equilibrium. We adapt the

framework of the fixed threat Nash equilibrium. The bargaining allocation is
characterized by the X value that maximizes the products of the gains from trade. Let
us denote by Z(X) and Z(X4) the production level of the developed and the developing
nations that is generated with an allocation of (X, X*). Note that the autarky production
level of the developed and the developing nations is given by Z(1) and Z*(0). The
bargaining allocation Xb is found by solving:

The two terms measure the percentage increase in the production (relative to autarky)
of the developed and developing countries, respectively. Note that the gains from trade
for the developing nations depend positively on T/K5. Inspection of (13) reveals that

t/K5 depends positively on the capital ratio in the sector with the low substitutability
relative to the high substitutability (i.e., on K/K5). The rational for this outcome is that
in autarky only sector 6 is producing. Sector
is ideal, because it can not produce
without Imports of X. Consequently, the gains from trade are greater for sector than
for sector 8, and these gains are tied to the relative size of sector f , as measured by the
K/K5 ratio.

determined by the will of the developing nations. In a more symmetric environment,
the move to the bargaining equilibrium may be also determined by the developed
nations. A higher trade dependency of the developing nations may increase their
vulnerability to such policies. In analyzing the consequences of external productivity

If there are no ways to commit the developing nations to follow a specified

that as long as we operate in the bargaining region, the repayment is dictated by the
bargainrng outcome. From the point of view of the developing nations it will be
advantageous to apply any investment towards reducing their trade dependency. Such
an investment will be beneficial for the developed countries for two reasons. First, they

Obviously, the interests of the developed nations will be best served by minimizing

investment in projects that reduce the trade dependency.
If there are credible ways to commit the developing countries to follow a specified
investment policy, then it may be beneficial for both blocks of nations to renew
marginal resource transfers, with the condition of targeting the investment in projects
that will increase the trade dependency of the developing countries. This may occur if
the developed nations agree to cut the resource transferred today below Rb, in exchange
for an investment in the sector that is highly trade dependent. Such an investment will
have the consequences of increasing the future resource transfer from Rb to Rb,

the renewed investment. Therefore, a strategy of reducing the present resource transfer
from the developing nations, in exchange for an equivalent increase in investment in
sector (the sector that is more trade dependent), and the return in period two to the
bargaining repayment (with repayment Rb) will benefit the developing countries.

by targetingthe investment in activity 8 (the sector that is less trade dependent),
thereby reducing their trade dependency15. Obviously, with such a strategy the
developed nations are always worse off16. Hence, the fact that the developing nations
will benefit from investment in trade dependent sectors does not negate the need to
impose conditionalityto ensure proper investment in the more trade dependent sector.
A way to alleviate some of the problems associated with setting the conditionality
for the proper use of funds, is to execute the renewed resource transfer through direct
investment. Such investment will be targeted to the proper sector, and may avoid some
of the monitoring issues. Therefore, we may conclude that the move to a bargaining
regime due to a partial default put greater weight on the importance of direct
investment as one of the few remaining channels for external finance of investment in

thedeveloping nations. The incentive problems that characterize the bargaining regime
in the presence of partial defaults leave few options for the renewal of external finance

for investment. The developing countries can choose either to accept detailed
conditionality attached to the finance of new investments, or to tolerate direct private
investment. In the first case, the conditionality provides the framework for monitoring.
In the latter, the private investor does the monitoring himself, by choosing the
investment projects. While none of these options may be enthusiastically endorsed by
the developing nations, they represent the few remaining channels for external finance
for renewed investment.
4. CONCLUDING REMARKS

key result derived in this paper is that the trade dependency determines the
bargaining outcome regarding the repayment associated with a partial default. Even
with a partial default, investment in highly trade dependent sectors with high
productivity may be warranted. This investment may be implemented by a marginal
relief of the debt service today in exchange for the investment in the proper sector.
Following such a scheme may require detailed conditionality and close monitoring. A
way to partially overcome some of the monitoring problems is through direct
investment. We close the paper with remarks concerning extensions and qualifications.
While we assumed there was no uncertainty, it could be added without
difficulties. For example, stochastic productivity of intermediate products will make the
dimensions of the Edgeworth Box in Figure 1 random, but the logic of our analysis will
stay intact17. An interesting result obtained in the paper is that the bargaining solution

THE BARGAININGOUTCOME

A useful characteristic of the bargaining outcome in the Nash fixed threat
framework (s that it is Pareto efficient (see Roth (1979)). We start the analysis by
deriving the characteristics of the contract curve, defined by the Pareto efficient points.
Thus, a point on the contract curve is defined by an allocation of X and Y among the
various activities that maximize the global weighted average of output. Therefor, for a
