THE EFFECT OF INFORMATION RELEASES
ON THE PRICING AND TIMING OF EQUITY ISSUES:
THEORY AND EVIDENCE

ABSTRACT

This paper develops a formal model of the timing and pricing of new
equity issues, assuming that managers are better informed than new
investors about the quality of the firm.

Firms will prefer to issue equity

when the market is most informed about the quality of the firm.

This

implies that equity issues tend to follow information releases, such as
earnings announcements.

The model also predicts a relation between the

timing and pricing of equity issues.

The price drop at the time of the

equity issue announcement should increase in the time since the last
information release, and the price drop at issue should increase with the
time since the last information release or issue announcement.

We teat

the predictions of the theory on a sample of NYSE, AMEX and OTC firms who

issued equity over the period 1978-1983. We find evidence that there is a
clustering of equity issues following earnings announcements and annual
reports, and also that the price drop at the time of the equity issue is
increasing in the time since the announcement of the issue.

1. Introduction

Recent research emphasizes the importance of asymmetric information in
explaining the pricing of seasoned new equity issues.

This paper develops

a formal model that extends these ideas to suggest that asymmetric
information also has interesting implications for the timing of new issues
(when new equity issues will he announced and brought to market), and the
relation between the pricing and timing of new issues.

We test the

predictions of the theory on a sample of New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),
American Stock Exchange (AMEX), and Over the Counter (OTC) firms who
issued equity over the period 1978-1983.
The importance of asymmetric information in pricing equity issues is
suggested by the fact that the stock price of a corporation issuing shares
falls an average of approximately 3% at the announcement of the issue
[Asquith and Mullins (1986) and Masulis and Korwar (1986)] and 0.65% at
the actual issue [Mikkelson and Partch (1988)]. One explanation for this
is that insiders with superior information about the firm have an
incentive to issue shares when the firm is overvalued.

Outsiders are

aware of this, and consequently lower their evaluation of the issuing
firm's quality, and thus the price they will pay for the firm's shares.
This creates a "lemons market" [Akerlof (1970) and Myers and Majluf
(1984)]

in new equity issues.

Previous authors [e.g., Leland and Pyle (1977) and Myers and Majluf
(1984)] have studied new issues taking the degree of information asymmetry
as given.

Our model rests on the observation that the information

asymmetry between insiders and outsiders is not fixed over time.

For

example, firms regularly disclose information in the form of earnings
announcements and audited annual reports.1

If a firm csn issue risky

2
securities when the market is most informed,

it will do so, since the

share price decline from an equity issue will be lower when information is
more symmetric.

Thus,

to the extent that firms have discretion in the

timing of issues of risky securities, we should expect to see these issues
clustered after information disclosures such as annual reports, quarterly
earnings announcements, or dividend declarations.
Section 2 formalizes these ideas with a model in which firms with a
positive NPV project choose whether or not to issue equity to finance the
project.
issue.

Some of these firms can also choose the timing of the equity
These firms have "durable" projects, while other projects

"evaporate" if not undertaken immediately.2 Project arrivals are
observable, but outsiders do not know their durability.

Firms also have

assets in place, the true value of which is publicly revealed at regular
information announcements, but which is otherwise known only to managers.
To understand the model, consider the case in which all projects are
durable, so postponing an equity issue has no impact on project value.

If

all firms were to issue equity whenever a new positive NPV project
arrived, the market price of equity would be the fair price for the
average firm, and equity issues would coincide with project arrivals.
However, firms with high quality assets in place will find it optimal to
wait to issue equity until the market learns the true value of the firm,
at which time the firm will receive
newly-issued equity.

a

higher than average price for the

Only low quality firms would ever issue before firm

value is revealed, so the market price for new equity issues prior to an
information release is below that for the average firm.

It follows that

3

in equilibrium all firms wait until information is released to issue
equity when waiting is costless.
Matters are more complicated if some firms cannot costlessly wait
before issuing equity.

At least some firms with evaporating projects will

issue equity immediately, despite an equity price decline, in order to
avoid losing the project.

The very best quality firms with evaporating

projects may choose to forego the investment opportunity.

Poor firms with

durable projects can profitably masquerade as firms with evaporating
projeccs by issuing equity prior to an information release, while the best
firms with durable projects will wait until an information release before
issuing equity.3

The net effect is that equity issues are concentrated

more heavily after information releases.
In this model pricing and timing are related.

The model implies that

the observed price of firms issuing equity declines with the time since
the last information release.

Thus, in equilibrium, the price of equity

issued before an information release is lower than the average price of
equity issued after an information release.
The theory leads to several readily testable hypotheses:
•

On average, equity issues will be clustered after information

releases such as annual reports, earnings announcements and dividend
declarations.

There should be few issues immediately prior to these

events.
•

The price drop at announcement of a new issue will be negatively

related to the time between the announcement date and the last information
releaae date.

Similarly, the price drop at issue will be negatively

4
related to the time since the last information release or issue
announcement.
In Section 4 we test these and related hypotheses.

In all four

quarters, we find support for the hypothesis that equity issue dates are
more frequent after earnings announcements than later in the quarter.

We

also test for an increase in the percentage price drop as a funrtion of
the time since the last earnings report.

We find the that the time

between announcement and previous information release has a positive but
insignificant effect on the magnitude of the announcement price drop.

The

time between the announcement of the issue and the actual issue, however,
has a positive and significant effect on the size of the issue price drop.

The Model
In this section we develop a model in which
1.

Investors and managers are asymmetrically informed about the value
of assets in place;

2.

The degree of this asymmetry changes over time; and

3.

An equity issue

is necessary in order to undertake a project.

The information asymmetry gives rise to a lemons market for equity.
Consequently, in deciding whether and when to issue equity, managers weigh
the cost of issuing (which can change over time) against the value of new
projects.
In this setting we are interested in answering two questions:

first,

what is the aggregate distribution over time of equity issues, and second,
how are the price drops at announcement and issue related to the timing of
information releases?

Initially we assume that the announcement of an

equity issue and the actual issue occur simultaneously. In Section 3 we
relax this assumption.

We allow only equity financing, but a similar

analysis should apply to risky debt.

Assumptions
Firms offer to sell equity to investors, who attempt to infer the

quality of the selling firm.

We assume the following:

Investors are risk-neutral. They know the distribution of

firm types, but they do not observe the type of a particular firm.

Firms are run by risk-neutral managers, who are assumed to act

in the interests of existing shareholders.4 Firms have assets in place
with value a.

They also potentially have new projetts with a known

The
Type d

firms have a choice of either issuing equity immediately, or costlessly
waiting to do so.

The remaining fraction (1-8) of firms are "type e",

with "evaporating" projects that must be financed immediately or foregone.
Project arrivals are uniformly distributed over time.

The probability

that a project is durable is independent of a and of the project arrival
time.

There are an infinite number of firms with projects arriving at

each instant. Under these assumptions, investors know the distribution of
firm types at each point in time.

with dp(t)/dt > 0.

At time 1 there is a fully revealing

announcement, and the process starts over again.9
Investors appraise firms conditional on their information release
dates, so we need only consider a single pattern of release dates.
Because the intervals are identical, and there is symmetric information at
the end of each interval, we can restrict attention to the interval (0,1].

We assume a zero interest rate.

Consider first the decision to issue at the end of the interval, when
managers and investors are symmetrically informed about the value of
assets in place.

can profitably issue equity at time 1.

These firms plan to

Description of the Equilibrium
In order to describe the equilibrium, we need to know precisely which

firms issue equity at each point in time, which in turn depends on the
valuation function,

be characterized.
Equations (5) and (6) have two major implications.

Second,

the incentive for type e firms to issue equity is greater than that for
type d firms, since if a project will evaporate, there is a greater
incentive to take it immediately.

These implications are stated formally

and proved in Lemma 1 (all lemmaa are stated and proved in Appendix B).

Because the incentive to issue equity is decreasing with the true value
of the firm,

the equilibrium valuation of a firm issuing equity can never

As a result, firms with durable projects and with average or

not issue when the cost of pooling with lower quality firms is great
relative to the value of the project.

they might raise the average issuer quality enough to make it optimal for

In order to eliminate this multiplicity, we will

focus solely on the highest price equilibrium, which is the equilibrium in
which the best quality evaporators issue equity whenever, conditional on
their issuing equity, it is optimal for them to issue.

Thus,

given the assumption that the worst type durable firms issue

equity immediately, Vt strictly decreases over time.

This implies that it

is in fact optimal for the worst type durable firms to issue equity
immediately, since they can not obtain a higher issue price by waiting.
By construction, this equilibrium valuation function is the highest
equilibrium valuation function.//
Note that for values of $ and

r

which do not satisfy (1), the valuation

function will also be non-increasing on [0,1).

Also, V1 will be greater

than the valuation over the previous interval (Lemma 3).
Theorem 1 characterizes the price behavior of firms issuing equity, but
a related question is how the quantity of firms issuing equity behaves

over the interval.

At an information release (e.g., time 0 or 1), there

will be a surge of equity issues as average and high-quality durable firms
issue to finance projects that arrived over the previous interval (Lemma
3).

Immediately thereafter, the number of issues decreases discretely, as

the better durables receiving new projects again postpone their issues
until the next information release.

If the best type e firma atop issuing

equity at time t', then there is another discrete fall in the number
issuing at t'.

(If the model permitted many values for assets in place,

there would be smaller, more frequent drops in the quantity of firms
issuing equity.

Firms would cease to issue equity as the market valuation

fell below the value of their assets.)

Between these falls, however, the

number of issues actually increases. This occurs because the proportion
of the worst type d firms in the issuing population increases amoothly
over time.

13

Finally, the greater the percentage of durable firms, the lower is Vt
at any t on (0,1) (Lemma 4).

The Price Drop st the Equity Issue Announcement
Theorem 1 implies that the market valuation of a firm conditional on

receiving a project and announcing an equity issue declines with the time
since the last information release.

The observed price drop at the

announcement of an equity issue, however, is the difference between the
valuation of the firm conditional upon receiving a project, and that
conditional upon receiving a project and issuing equity.

considered separately.

The firm may announce and then issue equity

without an intervening information release, or there may be an information
release between the announcement of the equity issue and the actual issue.

We derive the equilibrium price drop for firms both at the announcement
of an equity issue and at the actual issue.

The ultimate price drop, as

well as the decision to finally issue equity, depends upon whether there
is an intervening information release.

The model suggests that the price

drop at announcement is larger, the longer the time between the

17
announcement and the previous information release.

Similarly, for firms

which have an information releaae between the announcement and the issue,
the price drop at issue is larger, the longer the time between the issue
and the information release.

We allow firms to withdraw from an announced

issue if it is optimal to do ao.
To anticipate the results, we show that there will be a price drop at
the announcenent of the equity issue if there will not be a fully
revealing information release prior to the issue.

Depending upon

parameters, there may be a price drop at the actual isaue.

This can occur

because a firm which announced an iaaue learns that its value has
increased, leading it to withdraw.

If there are withdrawals, the

magnitude of the price drop will be increasing in the time between the
announcement and issue.

Informatiom Release Between Announcement and Issue
In this case, when a firm announces an equity issue, it is known that

the information asymmetry will be elimimated prior to the actual equity
issue.

To take an extreme case,

suppose that it was announced that the

firm would issue equity at the same time as the information release.

In

this case;- there would be no drop in price at the announcement, because at
the time of the issue there would be no information asymmetry.

Hence, all firms with

At the issue date the market evaluates

them conditional upon their type as of time 1.

The only relevant

information asymmetry at the time of the issue is from news about asaets
in place which becomes known after time

1.

Since all firms announce the issue, in theory there should be no price
drop.

This result depends upon the information release fully revealing

all information.

In practice, there will always be some remaining

asymmetry, and some firms know they will not issue, hence they will not
announce an issue.

Since there is now a pooling problem again, the price

will drop at the announcement of the issue.

Nevertheless, because of the

intervening information release, the price drop should be less than if
there were no intervening release.

withdrawals and find that 10% of announced common stock issues are
withdrawn.

They report that in 80% of the withdrawn security offers in

their sample, "unfavorable market conditions or a low stock price" were
cited as reasons for the withdrawal.

This withdrawal of an announced

20
offer can occur in our model when firms receive new private information,
which increases the dilution from issuing shares at the pooled price.

The

price drop for firms which issue shares is offset by a price increase for
firms which withdraw their offer.

4. Statistical Implications and Tests
a. Data Overview

We obtain the dates of seasoned underwritten primary and secondary
equity issues for the period 1978-1983 from Drexel Burnham Lambert's
Public Offerings of Corporate Securities (various years)

.

The reported

company names are used to match issue dates with company stock price and
financial data from the CR52 daily master, returns (NYSE/AMEX,

and

NASDAQ), and Quarterly Compustat (Industrial and Full Coverage) files.
The sample includes 1247 equity issue dates (646 are for NYSE/AMEX firms
and 601 are for OTC firms) obtained from Drexel's Offerings, although a
smaller sample remains after matching and screening for missing
observations.12

Observations are omitted for any of the following

reasons: inability to match company name with CRSP or Compustat, missing
data, or apparent data errors (for example the second quarter earnings
announcement date preceding the first quarter earnings announcement

Hypotheses and Tests

b.

We test the implications of the model by investigating the timing of
equity issues relative to regular quarterly information releases, and by
testing whether the announcement and issue date price effects of the
offering depend on the timing of the offer date.

The information releases

on which we focus are quarterly earnings announcements.
The first set of teats concern the timing of equity issues.

The

hypotheses which we teat are ma follows (Hni denotes null hypothesis i and
Hmi

denotes alternative hypothesis i):

Hypothesis 1:

The Timing of Equity Issues

issues are uniformly distributed over time.
Hn: Equity

Ha:

Equity

issues are clustered in periods immediately following information
releases.
The model implies that we should reject Hnl in favor of Hal since a
subset of firms (high value type d firms) will postpone equity issues in
order to avoid being pooled with poorer firms, and high value type e firms
may also forego projects when information becomea too asymmetric.

The

null hypothesis of a uniform distribution reflects our assumption that
projects arrive randomly over time (although they are not necessarily
funded wheb they arrive).

Of course,

the actual extent of clustering

depends on the underlying distribution of project arrivals, the durability
of projects, how relevant the information is, and the extent to which
information release dates can be adjusted.
We test for whether the distribution of iaaues is uniform using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic [Rao (1973, p. 421)].

For a given equity

22

issue, let DBR be the totsl number of days between the information release
immediately prior to the issue and the information release immediately
after the issue (BR denotes "Between Releases").

Also, let DI be the

nuisber of days between the information release immediately prior to the

issue and the date of the equity issue.

is the actual number of days

Sample size varies because of

earnings data availability, and because the quarter of the issue could not
be determined for some firms.

Table 4 summarizes the results.

The null

hypothesis of a uniform distribution is rejected for the combined
quarterly data, the annual data, and in most of the individual quarters.
In the model there is no distinction between announcements which
resolve more or less of the asymmetry. In reality one would expect to
find meastirable differences in the amount of information conveyed by
different announcements.

The finding that equity issues are not uniformly

distributed across the year is consistent with the intuition that because
of more detailed reporting and auditing requirements, fiscal year-end
earnings announcements and the annual report together resolve more of the
asymmetry in information than intra-year quarterly announcements.

Although we reject the uniform distribution for earnings announcements,
we also wish to know whether there is clustering after information events.
If there is clustering, the density of
should be skewed to the
DI/DBR
left,

and hence histograms of issue dates relative to the last information

release should be downward sloping.

Figures 2-5 (corresponding to the

events in Table 4) are basically consistent with this description:

issues

trail off toward the end of each quarter and at the end of the year)4
However, while the theory suggests that we should see many issues shortly
after an information release, the histograms suggest that issues are
fairly evenly distributed over the early to middle part of most quarters.
In fact,

at the beginning of the first quarter the number of issues

appears to be significantly below average.

A potential explanation for

the first quarter drop lies in the fact that the releases of the annual
report and 10-K typically follow the earnings announcement for the fourth

shortly before an information release, although they do not hurry to issue
immediately after an information release.
We also consider the effect of firm size on a firm's propensity to
issue around earnings announcements.

Since information tends to be

starter for saall firms, it may be that small firms have a greater
incentive to issue equity when fresh information is released.

To test

this idea, we regress D1 (days between announcement and issue) on firm
size,

as measured by market value of equity.

If small firms are more

anxious to issue when information is fresh, the correlation should be
positive.

The results of two simple cross-sectional regressions are

reported in Table 5.

The regression results support the hypothesis that

smaller firms are more likely to issue closer to an information release.

two predictions: (a) a negative relation between the price change upon
announcement of the issue and the time between the announcement and the
last regular information release and (b) a negative relation between the
price change at issuance and the time between issue and announcement.

In

the latter case the model predicts: (a) no correlation between the price
change at announcement of the issue and the time between the announcement
and the last regular information release and (b) a negative relation
between the price change at issuance and the time between issue and
announcement.
We test these propositions by regressing measures of abnormal returns
around the event day on the relative time between the information release
and announcement of the equity issue or on the time between the issue day
and announcement of the issue.

Theory predicts that the price drop at announcement should be unrelated to

(If the

information release is not fully revealing there should still be a price
drop --

the

announcement, and this shows up as the negative intercept.)
Although most of the preceding discussion has focussed on postponing
equity issues until after information releases, firms may also speed up or
delay information releases to more closely precede equity issues.

For

instance, firms have a window of 90 days in which they can file an annual
report after the fiscal year end.

Because of this flexibility, we expect

5. Conclusions

In this paper we explore the implications of information asymmetries
for the timing and pricing of equity issues, and find evidence supporting
the theory.
1.

In particular, we find that

Firms tend to issue equity earlier within a quarter rather than
later.

2.

Firms are least likely to issue equity in their fiscal-year fourth
quarter, immediately prior to the annual report.

The share price decline at the time of an equity issue is
increasing in the time since the announcement of the equity issue.

We have focussed upon earnings announcements as information-revealing
events, but firms can release information in other ways.

Earnings

announcements are appealing because there is ample evidence that they do
convey information, they are mandated, and there is only a limited degree

32
to which they can be manipulated.

Firms can also engage in voluntary

information releases, for which credibility problems arise.

interesting extension of this paper would be to arudy the effects of

An additional posaibility is that firma may voluntarily disclose
information at the time of a new issue.

One would expect voluntary

disclosures both to be costly and to suffer from problems of
then

verifiability. If such disclosures were costlessly verifiable,

models based upon asymmetric information could not explain the equity
price drop at the time of an issue.
2.

When all projects evaporate if not financed, the model is similar to that
in Myers and Majluf (1984).

3.

This is similar to the idea that firms always find it advantageous to
disclose all relevant information when it is free to do so [Grossman
(1979), Milgrom (1981), Fishman and Hagerty (l987)[

The management of an overvalued firm may optimally choose to finance a

negative NPV project. Taking into account the existence of negative NPV
projects would strengthen our prediction that the equilibrium equity
price will be higher after

information releases, because firms with

negative NOV projects lower the average quality of issuers when the
market is uninformed.

With an infinity of firms, however,

these firms would reduce the extent to which new issues are clustered

sfter information events, since they could issue equity at any rime.

It is possible to allow firms to also have financial slack (e.g. cash and
marketable securities),

as in Myers and Majiuf (1984).

However,

as the amount of slack is publicly known, the market evaluates

once the worst durable firms wait to issue equity, it is advantageous for
the better durable firms to wait until their type is revealed.

Thus,

in

equilibrium the worst durable firma would be revealed as being the worst

The only Nash equilibrium is for the worst durable

firms to pool with the evaporating firms, and for the better durable
firms to defer issuing equity until the next information announcement.

We have included additional regressors in cross-sectional regressions

components of the equity issue (% of previously outstanding equity) and
the size of the firm.
