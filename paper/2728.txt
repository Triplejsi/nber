TRANSFER INCOMES AND OLDER WOMEN'S WORK:
ESTIMATES FROM THE UNITED STATES

ABSTRACT

This paper deals with the effects of labor and transfer incoaes as
determinants of older women's labor force participation. It examines the
available from
responsiveness of women aged 48-62 to the level of income
both work and public transfer programs when deciding between work and
nonwork options.

The main focus is on whether the availability and gener-

of these
osity of disability-related transfers affects the labor supply
women.

A

msximum-likelihood model is estimated separately for heads of

household and wives.

The results suggest income opportunities have s

significant effect only on the work choices of wives.

The responsiveness

to the availability and generosity of public transfers is largest among
older,

disabled women who have low expected earnings.

The common

finding that women's labor supply response to wage and other income
changes is substantially larger than that for men suggests that future
aggregate cost, caseload, and welfare impacts of various social security
policies will be increasingly dominated by women and their choices.

one standard deviation below the mean are only about one-half as likely
to be labor market participants as those lying one standard deviation
above the mean earnings capacity. More significantly, those with poorer
labor market prospects (and hence superior income transfer opportunities)
are about twice as sensitive to income incentives as are those well up in
the potential earnings distribution.

Changes in income opportunities--

either from working or through transfers--appear to elicit a substantially greater response from low-skilled women than from those with
skills and high earnings potential. The low labor force participation
probabilities for less—skilled women (.4 for heads and .31 for wives)
appear to be rational responses to the income opportunities available to
them in both the labor market and the "transfer" market.
A test of the accuracy of our estimates is possible by comparing the
predicted results

to the actual participation—nonparticipation decision

of the older workers in the sample.

Of the 196 heads and 264 wives in

the sample who are participants, 75 percent and 72 percent, respectively,

are predicted by the estimated model to have a probability of more than
.5 of being participants.

Of the 148 heads and 278 spouses who are non-

participants, 64 percent and 71 percent, respectively, have a predicted
probability of more than .5 of beimg nonparticipants.

CONCLUSION

These estimates of response suggest that income opportunities,
whether in the labor market or the 'transfer"
the

market, have an effect on

work choices of older women, whether household heads or wives.

The

rapid increase in female labor force participation during the 1970s,
which accompanied increased relative female wage rates and an improved
outlook for women's work opportunities, are consistent with these
results (Killingsworth, 1983).

These results are also important for anticipating potential problems
associated with changes in income transfer policy.

For older women at

present, a primary source of income in the "transfer" market is 5501, yet
women have worked for a sufficient

a relatively small percentage of these

number of quarters to qualify for recipiency.

Given recent trends in

women's work patterns, a far greater proportion of older women in the
lS9Os

will be eligible for benefits.

Our results suggest that eligible

women--especially low earners, wives, and those with health problems--dc
income.
respond to changes in the generosity and availability of transfer

Sizable increases in expected benefits,

deriving from increases in either

generosity or leniency, may well have substantial impacts on older
women's work petterns.
Nevertheless, many questions remain unanswered.

Little insight is

gained into the relative contribution of other variables to the observed
increase in female labor force participation rates.

While our results

suggest that improvements in labor market incomes and opportunities in
the 1970s have contributed to the increase, the effect of changes in
tastes for work,

social expectations regarding work, the physical demands

of occupations, the incidence of impairments, and income from husbands
and other sources remains unexplained.

in this work is designed to be a multipurpose

indicator of true disability that emphasizes the functional and work—

True disability is viewed as an unobservable and its

The X vector includes the socioeconomic characteristics of the individual,

The I Vector of

include the extent of self-reported and interviewer-reported work limitations, medicalcare

utilization, specific health problems, general

health, mobility, and the percentage of weighted occupations for which a
person is qualified based on a comparison of job requirements with individual capabilities.
The results are used to calculate an imputed value of D* for each
