This analysis focuses on differential growth rates of real income and demand

markets,

and on the federal budget deficit of the Reagan administration,

which is seen as one of the driving forces in the appreciation of the dollar.

Explanations of Larse Econometric Models
The deterioration of the current account has been the focus of a number of

recent studies employing large econometric models, and these studies support
the hypothesis that less has changed than one might have thought from a

casual glance at Figure

The results of several forecasting experiments

are reported in Bryant, Holtham and Hooper (1988).

Bryant and Holtham (1988)

report the results of forecasting experiments from eight large models, and
Helkie and Hooper (1988) report the results of a partial equilibrium analysis
that is essentially based on the U.S current account sector of the Federal
Reserve Board Multicountry Model.
Given the Lucas (1976) critique of the prectice of building econometric
models without explicit consideration of the maximizing problems of economic
agents, it seems unlikely to me that the large econometric

and it is interesting to ask how well the models predicted the

predictions were often within a few billion dollars of the actual deficit in
1986, more than five years after the start of the dynamic simulations."

One major reason why large econometric models are not considered
structural is that the distributed lags in their decision rules often can be
shown to be a confounding of the equilibrium dynamic distributed lag

Helkie and Hooper (1988) find that the post-sample

Given that large econometric models with ex post values of real incomes
and relative price variables can track the current account, is it fair to
conclude that the structure of the world has not changed?

It seems that the

answer is yes, and the interesting issue becomes what sre the sources of the
fluctuations in these variables.

The inadequacy of the model of this section is highlighted by its
inability to address interesting policy issues.

The arrangement of markets for goods and assets follows the original

timing of the Svensson (1985) model with the goods market open in the
beginning of a period after the realization of the state.

Agents are

constrained to purchase goods with monies csrried into the period from the

After the closing of the goods market, the asset

values of assets and prices and the equilibrium decisions of agents are not
altered by changes in the timing of debt and taxes.

Hence, budget deficits

cannot affect capital flows in this model.
Preferences

and Budget Constraints

The preferences of agents in each country are assumed to be homothetic and
identical.

Agents trade in a number of different assets including the monies

and government bonds of the two countries,
firms in the two countries,

The agent's budget constraint during the asset market requires that the
value of the purchases of assets be less than or equal to wealth at that
time.

Sources of wealth are the values of the existing shares in the firms,

any unspent monies from the goods markets, any state-contingentpayoffs on
government bonds, and the payoffs on the tax-related assets.

Definition of an Equilibrium
Given the setup of the model at this point, it is now possible to define
an equilibrium.

The only equilibrium I consider is the perfectly pooled

stationary equilibrium of Lucas (1982) who noted that if agents have the same
preferences

and if preferences are homothetic, the ratios of consumptions of

the goods will be identical across countries.

The perfectly pooled

equilibrium arises when agents have identical wealth as well, and therefore
their consumption is the same.

If the agents in each country are endowed

initially with the ownership of the production process of their country and
are liable for the taxes of their country, the perfectly pooled equilibrium

requires that at initial prices, the wealths of the two countries happen to
be the same.

Different levels of wealth will result in different equilibrium

consumption levels, but with the homothetic preferences, asset prices will be
identical.

22

In the pooled equilibrium agents share equally the available outputs of
the two goods net of government consumption of the two countries

and of the

Although it appears from the definition of Alt+l in equation

(20)

that the

current account ought to depend on government bonds and taxes, one major
point about the equilibrium of this model is that the values of net foteign
assets do not depend directly on the financing of the government sector.
To see why, consider the dollar value of the tax-related asset whose
payoff is perfectly correlated with the taxes of country one.

The

equilibrium price of the asset is found from discounting the value of its
payoffs,

where the left-hand side of equation (23) is what appears in the definition

present value of nominal government spending beginning in period t+1 in
excess of what is financed by money creation.

The time pattern of taxation

and bond financing of country one does not enter the value of net foreign
assets and cannot be a determinant of capital flows.

A

similar argument

would apply to the government financing policies of country two.

The next

section exsmines a model in which the financing of government debt does

affect the equilibrium of the world economy.
The model of this section is a logical extension of the real business
cycle models that are the focus of much macroeconomic research.6 Capital
flows in this economy are simply the response to equilibrium risk sharing.

Things that increase the value of country one's technology will lead to a
measured capital outflow because they increase the wealth of the foreigner.

Let the aggregate amount of capital in period t be denoted Mt.

The four

production efficiency conditions relating the marginal products of the
factors of production to the wage rates and the common rental rate on capital

can be combined with the capital market equilibrium condition to determine
the allocation of capital across countries and the returns to the factors of
production as functions of the Mt and the productivity shocks.

Unfortunately,

As such,

they are potentially directly

they are not sufficiently well formulated that I

think they deserve to be examined empirically.

Rather than formally test and

reject the models, I examine some of their implications empirically in this
section.

I view the theory and empirical

sections of. this paper as

complementary avenues of investigation that are leading toward a well
designed theory that will eventually not be rejected by the data.
An Uodate of Evans (1986)
One of the most striking differences
implication

across the two models is the

that government budget deficits do not affect real allocations

and relative prices such as the real exchange rate in the Ricardian model

whereas they do affect the consumption and savings decisions in the
overlapping generations model.

Budget deficits also figure prominently in

the explanation of the movement in real exchange rates in the popular press,
in neo-Keynesian frameworks, and in the writings of Feldstein (1986).

Budget

deficits are thought to appreciate the dollar in nominal and real terms
leading to an overvalued currency and a current account deficit.
One way to investigate

the influence of budget deficits on the economy is

to adopt the reduced form methodology of Plosser (1982).

The idea is to

assume that one knows the return generating process for an asset or an
exchange rate from a rational expectations model.

This supplies an

observable unexpected component to the return or the change in the exchange
rate.

The unexpected change in the exchange rate is then regressed on

misspecified,

If the VAR is

as it will be if the agents of the economy have more

information than is attributed to them by the econometrician,

the approach is

suspect and nay be bankrupt in the sense that the parameter estimates will be
inconsistent.

Evans (1986) used this approach in an investigation of exchange rates
using quarterly data for the period 1973:11 to 1984:111.

Stockman (1986), in

his comment on Feldstein (1986), cites Evans (1986) as providing evidence in
opposition to the conclusions of Feldstein (1986) that budget deficits of the
U.S. appreciate the dollar.

Stockman (1986,

p.L+O4)

states:

When changes in real go'ernment spending and the deficit are
simultaneouslyincluded in an equation for the exchange rate, his
(Evans's) estimates

estimates

and sometimes statistically

Evans's

show a larger U.S. deficit, given real government spending,

leading to a dollar depreciation.
in his equations,

When Evans included foreign variables

he found that greater foreign government spending leads

to dollar depreciation and greater foreign deficits lead to dollar
appreciation,

with the estimated effects of U.S. government spending and

deficits remaining essentially unchanged.
Stockman (1986) recognized that additional data might be very useful in the
debate about the effects of deficits on the dollar, since the dollar
depreciated by a substantial amount from its peak in February 1985.

Because

I updated

his analysis with available data.
The results are presented in Table 4.

The exchange rate data were obtained from the OECD Main

Economic Indicators and are end-of-quarter rates for the spot and the threemonth forward exchange rates.

British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Deutsche mark, the Dutch guilder, the
French franc, and the Swiss franc.

Since several of these currencies

The motivation for the ependent variable is the unbiasedness hypothesis

presumption of risk neutrality.
specification is presented below.

Evidence on the validity of this

Here I merely note that previous research,

surveyed in Hodrick (1987), suggests that the specification is questionable.
Since unanticipated changes in exchange rates are so large,
though, it may be

reasonable to conclude that nothing particularly critical in the
interpretation of these results hinges on the failure of the unbiasedness
hypothesis.

This is certainly not true as a general rule.

The regressors in Table 4 include a constant and the residuals from a VAR

Since the exchange rates are U.S. dollars per Deutsche mark,
(appreciation)

a depreciation

of the dollar is a positive (negative) movement in the

dependent variable.

Hence, Evans found that an increase in federal

government spending causes a statistically

significant

appreciation of the

dollar relative to the mark, while increases in federal budget deficits,
which are measured positively, cause a statistically significant depreciatior
of the dollar, as do unanticipated increases in U.S. real balances and in the
U.S. price level.

One possible explanation of the coefficient on budget

deficits is that they are substantially endogenous and are merely reflecting
bad news about the performance of the U.S. real economy, which depreciates
the dollar.

Another explanation is that budget deficits are eventually

financed by printing of money, and an increase in the budget deficit creates
expected inflation which depreciates the dollar.

Evans

(1986) examined

cyclically adjusted budget deficits and found similar effects which tends to

39

support the latter interpretation.
The results in Table 4 indicate that extension of the sample period to
l987:IV completely eliminates

the statistical significance of the variables.

The magnitudes of the coefficients are reduced and are often of the opposite
sign of Evans's estimates.

The standard errors of the coefficients have

increased dramatically which eliminates the statistical significance of the
variables. In particular,

the effects of the government purchases

and

deficit variables are now no longer significantly different from zero.

The

reduction in the explanatory power of the variables in the larger sample is
now reflected in negative adjusted R2's.

My results are not as
Apparently,

Evans's

measurements of the GNP deflator as the last month of the quarter is one
source of difference between the two estimations.

The results also appear to

be somewhat sensitive to the starting date.
A complete explanation for the differences across periods would require
more space than can be used here, but one thing stands out.

If the VAR

methodology were correct, in the sense of capturing the exogenous forces of
the economy,

and there were no changes in regimes, the results would not be

so dependent on the sample.

Hence, the dependence I find must indicate that

the VAR methodology is very suspect and cannot be used to interpret

If agents are risk neutral, the

The motivation for the instruments on the right-hand aide of equation
is the following.

As Fama (1984) noted, the forward premium,

Therefore,

it should be a useful instrument if risk is actually present. If expected

should capture aerial correlation in the difference of the two returns if it

present.

Here I merely inquire how well two simple

The first model is in the spirit of the original analysis of

Hansen and Singleton (1982).

The second is related to the Ricardian model

derived above.
If agents are averse to risk, expected returns depend on nature of the
risk-aversion and the opportunities that they have for trading assets.

In

simple intertemporal asset pricing models, such as Hansen and Singleton
(1982),

the portfolio decisions require equality between the marginal utility

foregone when the asset is purchased and the expected discounted marginal
utility of the payoff on the asset.

The early empirical tests of the

intertemporal asset pricing used the cost of the asset in real terms times
the marginal utility of consumption goods as the opportunity cost of the
investment,

and the tests used the real payoff on the asset times the

46

marginal utility of consumption in the future as the realization of the
marginal gain on the investment.

The chi-square statistic

that tests the twenty overidentifying

restrictions has a value of 24.593, which corresponds to a marginal level of
significance of .217.

The U.K. data do not produce a coefficient of relative

risk aversion that is significantly different from zero, but the very atrong
evidence against the risk neutral model also is not present when consumption
is allowed to vary.
One reason the above specifications of the intertemporal asset pricing

model might be incorrect is that the timing of the marginal utility of
oomsumption is incorrect.

In cash-in-advance models such as the one above,

the dollar proceeds from an investment can only be used in the next available
goods market,

and the value of the return in terms of goods is not certain.

a standard error of 2.876, and a chi-square statistic of 24.463, which

48
Alternative Interpretations
One puzzling aspect of the above regression analysis is the
persistent
statistically significant negative coefficient on the forward premiums.

This

suggests that high values of the forward premium (high forward prices of
foreign currencies in term of dollars relative to spot prices) are associstec
with less depreciation of the dollar relative to the foreign
currency than
predicted by the forward premium.

Probably,

is

the smaller depreciation is

actually an appreciation of the dollar relative to foreign currencies.

A

potential explanation of this phenomenon is that the data are simply not

reflecting all of the possible events that concern agents when they are
setting asset prices.

Fama (1984) credits Mussa for advancing the following

hypothesis explaining why the sample statistics might not be consistent with
the true underlying probability distributiona that
agents assess rationally.

Since the forward preaium is directly related to the nominal interest
differential across countries from covered interest rate
parity, a large
positive value of the forward premium indicates that the U.S. nominal
interest rate is high relative to the foreign nominal interest rate.

Mussa

suggested that periods of high expected inflation in either country may also
be periods of highly skewed distributions of possible inflation rates.

One

reason would be because the privete sector is worried that the
public sector
may lose control of the economy. This skewed distribution of possible
inflation rates raises the expected rate of inflation,

which would raise thai

country's nominal interest rate, and increase the absolute value of the
forward premium.

If the sample size is insufficiently large, the

realizations of high inflation and large depreciations of currencies that
concern the private sector may be occurring with less
frequency in the actua]
data than is necessary to reconcile the use of asymptotic statistics.

Hence,

distributions of future exchange rates implicit in market pricea.

He finds a

lack of symmetry in the ex ante distribution of the dollar-OH rate.

Perhaps

use of additional data such as option prices will allow a better
understanding of the phenomenon in future work.
Additional data in the form of surveys of expected future spot rates have
also been employed by Frankel and Froot (1987).

Their findings with

relatively short sample peiods indicate that rationality of the survey data
can be rejected.
One possible explanation of the above empirical work is that the market is
assessing more possible events than have occurred during the sample period.
If this is the case, econometric analysis of the determination of
international capital flows and real exchange rates is probably also suspect.
Conclusions
In this paper I discuss alternative reasons for the current large U.S.
capital flows and attempt to provide some perspectives that can guide future
modeling of these issues.

One major findings is that movements of U.S. real

income growth relative to that of the rest of the world and movements in the
U.S. real exchange rate do a reasonable job of "explaining" the U.S.

account, when allowance is made for lags in responses.

current

Given this, it seemed

reasonable to develop models of the current account as a rational equilibrium
response of competitive agents to the stochastic forcing processes of their

50
economies.
I examined two sggregative dynamic models that have strong microeconomic

foundations. Both models explicitly develop the savings and investment
decisions of the private sector, and both consider rudimentary government
sectors.

Little work has been done on alternatives to

this idea in which the reasons why countriea

on each other are endogenous)3
One different prediction of the two models involves the role of government
budget deficits.

Both models predict that movements in productivity across

countries and in the sizes of the government sectors affect the real
equilibrium, but the Ricardian model predicts that the financing of the
government sector does not matter as long as the taxation is
nondiatortionary.
This difference in predictions was then examined empirically. The highly
significant empirical analysis in Evans (1986) that was interpreted as
evidence that U.S. budget deficits do not appreciate the dollar is not

deteriorates very badly.

The specification

While it is certainly possible that inference from

the VAR approach is worthwhile, one suspects that agents have additional
sources of information about future deficits not captured by the regressions.
Developing a model of the alternative way that agents forecast is necessary
before scientific inquiry can proceed.
I next explored two simple models of international capital market
equilibrium. The results of these risk premium studies have several
alternative interpretations. One may be that international capital markets
function poorly and allow exchange rates to be excessively volatile.

Another

is that risk aversion is an important attribute of our economic environment
that interacts with changes in the environment to produce substantial changes
in required expected returns and asset prices.14

A

third is that the

reported statistics are not appropriate because agents are assigning
probabilities to events that have not occurred with sufficient frequency.
The sample statistics are poor measures of the subjective probability
distributions implicit in the calculations that lead to the decisions of
agents.

If this is the case, such problems will infect any analysis of

exchange rates, and any regreasions purporting to explain capital flows will
no doubt be misspecified.
Understanding capital flows across countries requires an understanding of
the savings and investment decisions of economic agents and of the sources of

business cycles and of economic growth.

Equilibrium models of theses dynamic

aspects of the economy are still being developed.

Understanding capital

flows also requires an understanding of the determination of exchange rates

and other asset prices, which requires knowledge of expectations formation of
the private sector and of the influence of the government sector on the

52
economy.

The models of this paper may prove useful in the development of

future economic models of these phenomena.
In the introduction I outlined several important questions
posed because of recent U.S. current account deficits.

that have been

I now provide a

simple answer to the questions based more on the style of model that I have
developed than on the validity of the actual models.

The basic answer to all

of the questions is that the recent experience of the current account can be
thought of as a normal response of the economies of the world to variations

in the shares of government spending in the world economy, to cyclical
fluctuations and to diversities in rates of growth across countries.

People

who want government protection often think that foreign exchange and other
asset markets are not working correctly.

I

do not share

this opinion.

I

think that the stability of government policies and coordination of policies
across countries would help ease the forecasting problems that agents face.
