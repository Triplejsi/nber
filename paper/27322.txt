Did the Wisconsin Supreme Court Restart a COVID-19 Epidemic? Evidence from a Natural
Experiment

ABSTRACT
Both the White House and state governors have explicitly linked thresholds of reduced
COVID-19 case growth to the lifting of statewide shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs). This
“hardwired” policy endogeneity creates empirical challenges in credibly isolating the causal
effect of lifting a statewide SIPO on COVID-19-related health. To break this simultaneity
problem, the current study exploits a unique natural experiment generated by a Wisconsin
Supreme Court decision. On May 13, 2020, the Wisconsin Supreme Court abolished the state’s
“Safer at Home” order, ruling that the Wisconsin Department of Health Services
unconstitutionally usurped legislative authority to review COVID-19 regulations. We capitalize
on this sudden, dramatic, and largely unanticipated termination of a statewide SIPO to estimate
its effect on social distancing and COVID-19 case growth. Using a synthetic control design, we
find no evidence that the repeal of the state SIPO impacted social distancing, COVID-19 cases, or
COVID-19-related mortality during the fortnight following enactment. Estimated effects were
economically small and nowhere near statistically different from zero. We conclude that the
impact of shelter-in-place orders is likely not symmetric across enactment and lifting of the
orders.

1. Motivation
The speed and breadth with which COVID-19-related government restrictions on
business operations, personal movements, and assembly rights should be lifted has sparked an
intense public policy debate (Jarvie 2020, Vainshtein 2020). Proponents of lifting nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as blanket shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs) 1, nonessential business closings, bans on large gatherings, and school closings argue that the costs of
these policies — including increased unemployment (Baek et al. 2020, Couch, Fairlie and Xu
2020), decreased human capital acquisition (Doyle 2020), diminished consumption of
preventative and emergency care (Lazzerini et al. 2020, Santioli et al. 2020), and poorer
psychological health (Galea, Merchant and Lurie 2020, Hsing et al. 2020) — may be substantial.
Opponents argue that a rapid, broad-based reopening would quickly reduce social distancing,
create a false sense of optimism about contagion, and reignite the coronavirus pandemic,
overwhelming hospital resources (i.e. ventilators, hospital beds, and medical professionals) and
increasing coronavirus-related deaths. These arguments have framed the political debate over
the efficacy of lifting SIPOs and reopening non-essential businesses (Colliver 2020, Fadel 2020,
Usero 2020).
However, it is also possible that lifting SIPOs may have much smaller effects on social
distancing, COVID-19 cases, and unemployment rates than both proponents and opponents
suggest. If most social distancing behavior and job loss are not caused by mitigation policies,
but rather are explained by demand shocks caused by rapid diffusion of COVID-19 information
or via Bayesian updating of coronavirus risk assessment (Barrios and Hochberg 2020, Holtz et

1

Individuals under a SIPO are only allowed to leave their homes for “essential” activities such as shopping for food
or medicine, reporting for work in an industry deemed essential, or caring for a sick relative.

al. 2020), the effects of lifting SIPOs may be quite small. 2 Moreover. the elasticity of social
distancing (and COVID-19 cases) with respect to mitigation policies may fall over time as
individuals learn about healthier options for population mixing (i.e. mask-wearing, 6-feet social
distancing with non-household members). 3
Using a standard difference-in-differences approach to estimate the effect of lifting a
statewide SIPO on COVID-19 cases faces two first-order identification problems. First,
policymakers explicitly tie the decision to allow a SIPO to expire to COVID-19 case growth, a
textbook case of policy endogeneity. White House reopening guidelines, issued jointly with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend a “downward trajectory of documented
cases within a 14-day period” before a state or region proceeds to a phased reopening (White
House 2020; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020). This national recommendation
is in-line with state and local policies with regards to ending SIPOs. 4 For instance, Oregon rules
require that “counties where more than 5 people have been hospitalized for severe COVID-19
symptoms in the past 28 days must see declining hospitalizations for 14 days in order to begin
reopening” (Oregon Health Authority 2020). Similarly, New York requires “a downward
trajectory of hospitalizations and infections over a 14-day period,” as well as “a sustained decline
in the three-day rolling average of daily hospital deaths over the course of a 14-day period,”
which like the national recommendations explicitly links trends in the outcome variable of
interest to implementation of the policy (New York Forward 2020).

2

It is also possible that SIPO adoption or lifting may impact perceptions of coronavirus risk as well as information
about the virus’s spread.
3
This argument suggests that the social distancing (and case) effects of SIPO adoption and SIPO lifting may be
asymmetric.
4
While the federal government can make recommendations with regards to social distancing policies, the power to
enact or revoke most of these policies lies with state and local governments.

2

These ties of policy to trend are not simply made explicit in the written policies, but are
also publicly communicated by state leadership. To take one prominent example, in a May 22,
2020 news conference, New York governor Andrew Cuomo commented on reopening plans for
the Mid-Hudson region (immediately north of New York City) as well as parts of Long Island,
saying, “If the number of deaths continue to decline … both regions could reopen” (Newsday
Staff 2020).
Second, an emerging literature documents that the enactment of statewide SIPOs,
particularly those that were adopted early and in areas with low case growth (Friedson et al.
2020; Dave et al. 2020a, b) were successful at “bending the case curve” for COVID-19
(Courtemanche et al. 2020; Dave et al. 2020a). For instance, Dave et al. (2020a) find that SIPO
adoption is associated with a 44 percent reduction in COVID-19 cases. Taken at face value,
these results imply that pre-treatment trends in a difference-in-differences-based statewide SIPO
expiration analysis will not be parallel. 5
Together, the above insights suggest that using a difference-in-differences approach to
estimate the impacts of SIPO expiration will be highly problematic for causal inference. 6,7 Thus,
rather than examine gubernatorial decisions on SIPO lifting, we instead turn to a unique natural
experiment to identify the causal effect of SIPO expiration on social distancing and COVID-19

5

This would be true among early adopting SIPO states, which were the only states for which SIPOs were found to
“bend the case curve”.
6
We hypothesize that the expiration of a SIPO is much more endogenous to COVID-19 cases than was its
enactment. No state or Federal guidelines of which we were aware recommended jurisdictions enact a SIPO if a
case growth rate rose above a particular threshold. Further, there is little evidence of any non-SIPO policy flattening
the COVID-19 case curve. The only significant estimates show benefits from bar and restaurant closures that are
modest when compared to the effects of SIPOs (Courtemanche et al. 2020).
7
Note that there is no problem of insufficient policy variation, just that the available variation is likely to be
endogenous in most cases. There is a considerable amount of variation in the timing of the end of state or local
SIPO, with 37 states lifting some form of social distancing policy between April 20, 2020 and May 13, 2020 (Gupta
et al. 2020b). However, policies regarding coronavirus provide numerous challenges to the difference-in-differences
strategy, in particular with regards to the assumption of parallel pre-policy trends (Goodman-Bacon and Marcus
2020), concerns that are exacerbated in the context of examining reopening states by ending social distancing
policies as both national guidance and explicit state level policy rules tie opening behaviors to the trends themselves.

cases. This sudden, dramatic, and somewhat unexpected policy shock was generated by a state
court ruling on the constitutionality of a statewide SIPO.
On May 13, 2020 in Wisconsin Legislature v. Palm, the Wisconsin State Supreme Court
struck down Wisconsin’s “Safer at Home Order” (Ruthhart 2020). The Court ruled that Andrea
Palm, the secretary-designee of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, violated state law
by issuing the stay-at-home decree as an “order” instead of a “rule.” This distinction allowed the
Executive Branch (the governor’s office) to circumvent weeks-long legislative oversight and
possible veto, and instead immediately implement the policy (Supreme Court of Wisconsin
2020). While Palm argued that the specificity of the COVID-19 crisis permitted her to issue an
order, the Court ruled that by bypassing a lengthy administrative rulemaking process and
legislative review (Johnson 2020; Millhiser 2020), the Safer at Home Order was “unlawful,
invalid, and unenforceable” (Vetterkind and Schmidt 2020; Hagemann 2020).
The force and effect of this legal ruling was dramatic and immediate. The entire
statewide order was overturned (with the exception of the school closures; see Deliso 2020; Beck
2020), making Wisconsin the only U.S. state without a single statewide protective measure in
place (Ruthhart 2020).8 The legal ruling immediately allowed non-essential businesses to reopen
without restriction, with many bars opening on the night of the decision, gaining national media
attention (O’Kane 2020). Observing the night’s events, Wisconsin’s Governor Tony Evers said
that the ruling had “throw[n] the state into chaos,” and predicted that “people are going to get
sick” (Evers 2020).
This study exploits this unique experiment to identify the causal effect of Wisconsin’s
SIPO termination on social distancing and COVID-19 cases. First, using anonymized, geospatial

This decision also marked the first successful legal challenge of a SIPO (Deliso 2020; Beck 2020; Jimenez and
LeBlanc 2020).

smartphone data from SafeGraph, Inc. from May 3 through May 24, and a synthetic control
approach, we find no evidence that the statewide legal order significantly affected several
measures of state-level social distancing: the percent of the time spent at home full-time, median
hours spent at home, part-time work behavior, and full-time work behavior. 9 While we detect
some evidence of a modest decline in stay-at-home behavior in the first four days following the
order’s enactment, the trend reverses itself thereafter producing a net null effect over the full
post-treatment period.
Then, turning to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from May 3 through
May 26 on COVID-19 cases and deaths, synthetic control estimates fail to detect any evidence
that the Wisconsin Supreme Court order affected COVID-19 health, including during the period
following the coronavirus’s incubation. These null results are robust to (i) choice of donor
states, including states that had a statewide SIPO in effect beyond the median incubation period
and SIPO states that either had no reopenings or limited reopenings, and (ii) choice of observable
matching variables to create synthetic weights, including COVID-19 case rates per all pretreatment days, urbanicity rate, population density, COVID-19 testing rates, pre-treatment social
distancing, and other business reopening policies.
The remainder of the paper explores the explanation for this null result and examines
heterogeneous treatment effects that may be masked by our zero net effect result. We draw three
conclusions from this analysis. First, while 5 of 72 Wisconsin counties enacted longer-term local
safer-at-home orders to try to counter the Supreme Court decision, accounting for these county
policies does not change our main finding. Second, we find no evidence that urbanized or
densely populated counties were differentially affected by SIPO termination. Finally, we do find

Goodman-Bacon and Marcus (2020) recommend that in the context of COVID-19 policies, researchers focus
especially on techniques “that impose balance in pre-policy infection levels and trends,” such as synthetic control.

some evidence of heterogeneity in the response to the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision by
2016 voting behavior of residents. In counties where a majority of residents voted for
Republican President Donald Trump, the termination of the SIPO was associated with a larger
short-run decline in social distancing. However, there is little evidence of higher growth in
COVID-19 cases for these counties relative to the others over the post-repeal period.

2. Background and Reaction to Wisconsin Supreme Court Decision
Wisconsin saw its first case of COVID-19 on February 5, 2020 (Wisconsin Department
of Health Services 2020; Wiscontext 2020). More than a month passed before the second
documented case emerged on March 9. By March 25, there were 583 new confirmed cases,
bringing the total number of cases to 585 or 10 cases per 100,000 population (Wisconsin
Department of Health Services, 2020; Wiscontext, 2020). In an attempt to “flatten the case
curve,” at 8:00 a.m. on Wednesday, March 25, 2020, Andrea Palm, secretary-designee of the
Wisconsin Department of Health Services (under the direction of Governor Tony Evers) signed
Emergency Order 12, a statewide “Safer at Home Order” (State of Wisconsin 2020).
This SIPO required all individuals within the state of Wisconsin to stay in their place of
residence at all times except for essential activities. Essential activities were defined as those
activities necessary to maintain health and safety, such as obtaining medication or seeking
emergency health care, grocery shopping, outdoor exercise, performing work at essential
businesses or operations and related travel, and provision of care for others (State of Wisconsin
2020). Additionally, the SIPO required social distancing of six feet whenever residents leave
their houses, and prohibited all non-essential travel. The order also required all non-essential
business operations to cease, performing only Minimum Basic Operations (State of Wisconsin

6

2020). 10 Exempt from this order were businesses deemed essential, including but not limited to
stores that sell food and medicine, transportation, funeral establishments, take-out services,
transportation, and social service organizations (State of Wisconsin 2020).
This order was set to remain in effect until 8:00 a.m. on Friday, April 24, 2020.
However, eight (8) days prior to the expiration date, Andrea Palm issued Emergency Order 28,
which extended the Safer at Home order until 8:00 a.m. on Tuesday, May 26, 2020 (Office of the
Governor 2020). The order also implemented changes to the original order, which were to be
effective on April 24. Included in these changes were modest reopenings for non-essential
businesses. Public libraries were allowed to open for curbside pick-up, golf courses were
permitted to open with restrictions to ensure social distancing, in-person retail was allowed for
up to five customers at a time at particular shops, arts and craft stores were allowed to offer
curbside pick-up, and aesthetic work was permitted with one worker (State of Wisconsin 2020;
Office of the Governor 2020). In addition, guidelines for safe business practices, including
disinfecting practices and safe waiting areas or lines were also announced. Finally, all public
and private schools were ordered to remain closed for the remainder of the school year.
The revised Safer at Home order was set to expire on May 26. But on April 21, the
Republican-controlled Assembly and Senate, led by Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald and
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, filed a lawsuit, Wisconsin Legislature v. Palm, which sought to
overturn the Safer at Home order on separation of powers grounds (Wisconsin Legislature v.
Palm 2020; Millhiser 2020). While state law allows the Department of Health Services extensive
power when dealing with a communicable disease, the Republican legislature claimed that the
Office of the Secretary had exceeded its legal authority. In a 4 to 3 decision, issued on March

10

These include the necessary activities to maintain the value of the inventory and capital, process payroll, facilitate
remote work, and other related functions.

7

13, 2020, the Wisconsin State Supreme Court struck down the statewide SIPO, siding with the
plaintiffs that the administration had exceeded its authority (Ruthhart 2020; Vetterkind and
Schmidt 2020; Deliso 2020; Beck 2020; Jimenex and LeBlanc 2020; Hagemann 2020). In
addition to striking down the SIPO, the order declared all new COVID-19 public health
restrictions in Wisconsin subject to review and potential veto by legislative committee.
Political opinion in Wisconsin was divided. While Republican Senate Majority Leader
Fitzgerald said that “the public started to become skeptical” of Democrat Governor Evers’ ability
to guide the state through the pandemic (Beck 2020), polls taken during the week the Supreme
Court decision was handed down showed that the public trusted Evers with reopening of the state
more than the state legislature. Additionally, polls found that nearly 70 percent of voters believed
that Evers’s order was appropriate given the severity of the pandemic (Ruthhart 2020; Beck
2020).11
Reaction to the Supreme Court decision was swift and partisan. Governor Tony Evers
declared:

“Republican legislators convinced four members of the Supreme Court to throw the state
into chaos. They have no plan. People are going to get sick, and those Republicans own
this chaos” (Ruthhard 2020).

whereas Republican Steve Nass, co-chairman of the Wisconsin legislature’s rules committee
claimed:

11

During the decision process, dissenting justice Ann Bradley stated that “the lack of a stay would be particularly
breathtaking given the testimony yesterday before Congress by one of our nation’s top infectious disease experts,
Dr. Anthony Fauci. He warned against lifting too quickly stay-at-home orders” (Ruthhart 2020).

8

“I have great faith that people will make the decisions necessary to fight COVID-19 on
their own without excessive government intervention” (Richmond 2020).

Of course, the actual response by individuals within Wisconsin remains an empirical question,
and is the focus of the analyses to follow.

3. Data and Methodology
3.1 Data
To examine the effect of the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision on social distancing, we
utilize data from SafeGraph Inc. 12 SafeGraph provides an anonymized population movement
dataset representing approximately 45 million smartphone devices. The number of smartphone
devices is aggregated to the census block level and these aggregated data are made available to
members of the public who apply for them via SafeGraph. These data have been used by a
growing number of scholars studying social distancing in the United States following the
COVID-19 outbreak (Maclean et al. 2020; Dave et al. 2020a,b; Friedson et al. 2020; Abouk and
Heydari 2020), as well as by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Lasry et al. 2020).
Our analysis period is 22 days from May 3, 2020 through May 24, 2020, which envelopes the
Supreme Court decision that abolished the SIPO. 13 The start of our sample period also ensures
that any effects we find are not confounded by the modest re-openings of non-essential
businesses that were allowed starting on April 24th with the extension of the original SIPO.

12

Data and detailed descriptions of variable construction are available at:
https://www.safegraph.com/dashboard/covid19-shelter-in-place
13
This is well after the April 7, 2020 Wisconsin primary election, which has been shown to have had an effect on
COVID-19 cases in Wisconsin (Cotti et al. 2020).

9

From these data we collect four key state-by-day measures of social distancing. Our first
measure, Stay-at-Home Full Time, captures the percent of the state population who remain at
home for the entire day. A person’s home is defined as a 153-meter by 153-meter area that
receives the most frequent GPS pings during the overnight hours of 6pm to 7am. To construct
this measure, each smartphone phone is assigned a “home” (or 153m by 153m square) based on
a common nighttime location over a baseline period. SafeGraph then calculates the percent
staying at home, i.e. the fraction of cell phones in a geographic unit (state, county, or census
block) that do not leave the “home” for any given day. 14 This extensive measure of social
distancing is one that we expect to be substantially affected by a state SIPO. We find that in the
state of Wisconsin, 35.7 percent of respondents remained at home full-time over the sample
period.15
Second, we measure Median Hours at Home, the median number of hours spent at home.
This measure captures social distancing behavior at the intensive margin as well. We find that
those in Wisconsin remained in their homes for a median number of 12.1 hours per day.
Third, we measure the Median Percent Time Spent at Home, the median percent of the
time that cell phones are located at home. Our data show a median home time of 88.8 percent
among those residing in Wisconsin.
Finally, we measure work behavior of state residents by whether the cell phone device
was tracked as leaving the “home” area for the same destination for at least 6 hours between the
hours of 8am and 6pm during the day, which is termed Full-Time Work Behavior. If the cell
phone instead left for the same destination for 3 to 6 hours between 8am and 6pm, we define it as
Part-Time Work Behavior Over the sample period, we find that an average of 3.5 percent of

14
15

SafeGraph makes adjustments for small geographic units which are not relevant for a state-level analysis.
At the start of our sample period (May 3), this fraction was 36.8 percent.

10

Wisconsinites engaged in full-time work behavior and 5.6 percent engaged in part-time work
behavior.
Appendix Figure 1 shows trends in these four measures of social distancing for each
state, with Wisconsin highlighted in black. Trends in social distancing are flat or slightly
declining over this period.
To examine the short-run effects of the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision on COVID19, we utilize a panel of state-specific daily counts of cases and deaths from May 3, 2020
through May 26, 2020. These data are collected by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and made public by the Kaiser Family Foundation. 16 As of May 26, there
were a total of 1,684,404 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States, 0.9 percent (15,923)
of which were in Wisconsin, and 95,871 coronavirus-related deaths, 0.5 percent (517) of which
were in Wisconsin. Our central public health outcomes of interest are 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 , measuring

the cumulative number of confirmed coronavirus cases, and 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷ℎ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 , which is the number
of coronavirus-related deaths per 100,000 population, in state s at day t. Appendix Figure 2
shows state-specific trends in cumulative coronavirus case and death rates per 100,000
population in Wisconsin as well as for the remaining 49 states and the District of Columbia.

3.2 Methods
The main aim of this study is to capitalize on the unanticipated policy shock, generated
by the Wisconsin State Supreme Court’s ruling, in order to identify the causal effects of the
termination of the statewide shelter-in-place order on social distancing and public health. Our
empirical analysis proceeds in a sequential manner to address these questions.

Before we turn to estimating effects of the termination of the SIPO, it important to
establish that the original adoption of the statewide SIPO in Wisconsin (on March 25) causally
impacted (i) social distancing, and (ii) the number of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths in
the state. We do so by using the synthetic control method introduced by Abadie et al. (2010) and
applied by Friedson et al. (2020) for the implementation of the California SIPO, which relies on
data from pre-treatment outcomes and observable characteristics of states that may influence the
spread of the virus or its detection to generate a counterfactual for Wisconsin in the absence of
the statewide shelter-in-place order.
Next, we continue with our synthetic control approach to infer the causal impact of the
Supreme Court’s ruling in Wisconsin (lifting the statewide SIPO) on social distancing and the
number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. To generate a counterfactual for Wisconsin
in the absence of the Supreme Court decision, we draw on our primary donor pool comprised of
17 states and the District of Columbia. For our measures of social distancing, where estimated
effects of a SIPO expiration may materialize immediately, our donor pool consists of states that
had a statewide SIPO in effect during the entire analysis period for which we have SafeGraph
data (May 3 through May 24). For cases and deaths analysis, we expand our donor pool to
include both those states that had a SIPO in effect during the entire analysis period (May 3
through May 26) as well states that allowed their SIPOs to expire, but had fewer than five days
of post-treatment data, which is the median incubation period for COVID-19.
We estimate the unobserved counterfactual (“synthetic Wisconsin”) as a weighted linear
combination of states included in the donor pool. The weights are chosen so as to generate a
synthetic state that is as similar as possible to Wisconsin on key observables. Given the
importance of our selection (i) of states to be included in the donor pool, and (ii) observable

12

characteristics on which to closely match Wisconsin to its synthetic counterpart, we explore the
sensitivity of our estimates to these choices (Ferman 2019).
Our choice of the donor pool is informed by requiring that all control states had a SIPO in
effect during the entire period under study. We also experiment with limiting the donor pool
further by excluding (i) any state that even partially permitted reopening of restaurant and other
food services with in-room dining (even at limited capacity) or retail, mall, or movie theatre
reopenings beyond curbside pickup or drive-in movies, or (ii) any state wherein more than 50
percent of the population resides in counties that permitted any reopening of these non-essential
businesses and services.
With regard to the choice of observables used to select our synthetic control from among
the donor states, we take several approaches. In one strategy, we match on each of 10 days (May
3 through May 12) of pre-treatment social distancing and confirmed COVID-19 case rates per
100,000 population, which effectively requires growth rates to be identical. While choosing a
counterfactual based only on pre-treatment outcomes eliminates concerns of ‘p-hacking’ (Hansen
et al. 2020; Botosaru and Ferman 2017), this approach also effectively eliminates the role of
other factors that could affect COVID-19 outbreak (Kaul et al. 2018). 17
Thus, in other approaches, we match on (i) state population density and a state urbanicity
index, factors that play an important role in COVID-19 spread (Friedson et al. 2020; Dave et al.
2020a,b), (ii) COVID-19 testing rates, which may play an important role in coronavirus
detection, (iii) other pre-treatment COVID-19 policies (i.e. whether the state permitted state
parks to be open and whether the state permitted roadside pickup of retail, both of which
Wisconsin had prior to the Supreme Court decision), and (iv) social distancing prior to the

17

As shown by Kaul et al. (2018), matching on all periods of pre-treatment outcomes renders all covariates
irrelevant in the prediction of the outcome.

13

Supreme Court Decision. To conduct hypothesis tests, we conduct placebo tests following the
method suggested by Abadie et al. (2010) to generate permutation-based p-values.
Next, we carry over the control states identified in the synthetic control approach and also
estimate the following baseline difference-in-differences specification, drawing upon county-byday data from Wisconsin and the control states:
Ycst = β0 + β1*SIPOEXPcst + β2*BUSINESSREOPENst + β3*CAREREOPENst
+ β4*ACTIVITYREOPENst + αcs + γt + εcst

(1)

where Ycst measures one of our outcome variables (social distancing, log COVID-19 cases, log
deaths) in county c in state s on day t, and SIPOEXP is an indicator set equal to 1 if the
observation is drawn from Wisconsin in the post-Supreme Court period. The sample is
comprised of counties in Wisconsin and in each of the donor states that received a positive
weight in the synthetic control model. BUSINESSREOPENst is an indicator for whether the
state had begun a partial reopening of restaurants, bars, and retail stores such as roadside pick-up,
and limited capacity. CAREREOPENst is an indicator for whether the state had begun a
reopening of personal or pet care, including barber, salons, and pet grooming services.
ACITIVTYREOPENst is an indicator for whether the state had begun a partial reopening of
activities and entertainment including gyms, state parks, and drive-in movie theatres. In
addition, αc is a set of county fixed effects to control for fixed differences across states in social
distancing or COVID-19 infections due to, for example, baseline hospital capacity differences,
population density, the presence of an important airport hub, or baseline testing capacity; γt is a

14

set of day fixed effects to control for national factors that commonly affect our outcomes. 18
Regressions are weighted using synthetic weights.
In alternate specifications, we also add controls for state-specific linear time trends (αs*t)
to capture any unmeasured area-level time trends that could be coincidentally associated with
COVID-19 growth and with the Supreme Court decision. The locality-specific trends can help
account for unobserved factors driving the exponential growth trajectory of transmissions, and
effects in this case would be identified off deviations from this trend growth (Dave et al 2020a).
The advantage of the county-by-day difference-in-differences setup is that it allows us to
explore heterogeneity in the effect of the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision across several
margins, as follows:
Ycst = β0 + β1* (Xc*SIPOEXPcst) + β2*BUSINESSREOPENst + β3*CAREREOPENst
+ β4*ACTIVITYREOPENst + αcs + γt + εcst

(2)

In equation (2), Xc denotes the specific dimension that may drive potential differential
responses in Wisconsin to the Supreme Court’s rescinding of the statewide SIPO.
First, we consider whether the county issued a local stay-at-home order in response to the
statewide termination. Fourteen of the state’s 72 counties responded to the Supreme Court ruling
by enacting policies to mitigate the potential effects of the lifting of the statewide order.
Extenders included Dane and Milwaukee counties – population centers that contain the cities of
Madison and Milwaukee, respectively – as well as several other less urban counties. These
localities effectively extended the governor’s shelter-in-place order by re-issuing makeshift local
public health orders, and conveying to residents and businesses that a local order remains in

The day fixed effects also flexibly control for any intra-week cyclical variation (for instance, weekday vs.
weekend or holiday effects) that may be driving the demands for time, economic and non-economic activity, and
hence social distancing.

15

effect in spite of the state order being overturned. For most of these localities, the extensions and
stays were temporary, on average lasting only three to four days beyond the Supreme Court
ruling, and enacted mainly as a stop-gap measure to give businesses some leeway to prepare to
open or resume. Five counties, representing 30.9 percent of the state’s population, however
prolonged their local stay-at-home orders longer, and residents in these counties continue to be
bound by their local SIPOs as of the end of our sample period. 19
While the Supreme Court ruling was binding for most Wisconsinites, we assess whether
there were any differential effects in social distancing and COVID-19 cases across counties that
strictly abided by the ruling and its timing vs. counties that responded to the ruling by extending
their local orders either temporarily or for a more protracted period. We estimate equation (2) by
interacting an indicator (Xc) for whether the county issued an extension (either a stop-gap
temporary or prolonged local order) in response to revocation of the statewide SIPO.
Next, we explore heterogeneity in the effects of the repeal of the SIPO by urbanicity and
population density, by alternately interacting the SIPO repeal (SIPOEXP) by (i) whether the
county had an urbanicity rate of at least 50 percent (Xc; 26 of all 72 Wisconsin counties); and (ii)
whether the county had population density of at least 75 persons per square mile (Xc; 24 of 72
Wisconsin counties). Prior work has established that state SIPOs as well as localized SIPOs are
more effective in states and counties that are highly urbanized and densely populated (Dave et al.
2020a, b). The larger gains from SIPOs in these areas derive from urbanicity and population
density being important predictors of social interactions and potential magnifiers of infection
transmission. These studies find that shelter-in-place orders tend to elicit a larger response vis-a-

19

These five counties are: Dane, Eau Claire, Florence, Milwaukee, and Racine. The other nine counties with
temporary stays are: Kenosha, Calumet, Outagamie, Winnebago, and Brown, with extensions of local orders ranging
from 1-3 days; and Marquette, Green, Door, and Rock, with extensions ranging from 5-9 days.

16

vis social distancing in more urban and populated areas, and also that a given level of social
distancing may translate into larger gains in the containment of COVID-19 infection in these
areas. While we do not expect the effects of the initial adoption of the statewide SIPO and its
subsequent repeal to be symmetric, these considerations warrant an exploration of whether the
average statewide effect is masking important heterogeneity across these dimensions. Moreover,
behavioral responses in terms of mobility and sheltering-in-place to the lifting of a SIPO may
vary depending on options for outside activities, risk perceptions, and population mixing, all of
which are likely to differ across urban (more densely populated) vs. non-urban (sparsely
populated) areas.
Finally, we consider whether the effects of the Supreme Court decision differed based on
political preferences, by interacting the main effect in equation (2) with an indicator (Xc) for
whether a majority of the county voters voted for Republican presidential candidate Donald
Trump in 2016. Given the divided political opinion in the state, and the split decision across
party lines, ideology may well impact the degree to which residents heeded the Democratic
governor’s admonition to continue sheltering-in-place after the repeal of the statewide SIPO.
For the difference-in-differences analyses, with a single treated state and a few control
states, deriving inferential statistics based on state-clustered standard errors is not an option as
these would likely overestimate statistical significance (Cameron and Miller 2015; Cameron,
Gelbach, and Miller 2008). We therefore conduct statistical inference via permutation-based pvalues generated by rank tests, which imposes a very high standard for achieving statistical
significance (Cunningham and Shah 2018). This involves comparing our treatment effect
generated from the difference-in-differences model (equation 1 or 2) with placebo estimates
obtained by running additional specifications, in each case replacing Wisconsin (the true treated

17

unit) with an indicator for one of the other control states. Since the number of control states
identified from the synthetic control approach is a small subset of the donor pool, achieving 5
percent and 10 percent significance is often not possible in our case. For instance, if the total
number of states (WI + control states) in a given difference-in-differences model is nine, then
achieving at best 11.1 percent statistical significance requires that Wisconsin be ranked at the
very extreme of the placebo distribution. We present these rank tests for all estimates, and draw
conclusions from the weight of the evidence from the magnitudes, any consistent patterns, and
inferential statistics.

4. Results
We present our main findings of Wisconsin’s statewide SIPO repeal, driven by the abrupt
and unanticipated Supreme Court ruling, on measures of mobility and on COVID-19 related
health outcomes in Tables 1 and 2, and in Figures 1-3. Estimates of the heterogeneity analyses
are presented in Table 3 and in Figures 4-6, and additional analyses addressing specific issues are
presented in the Appendix.

4.1 Wisconsin’s SIPO Repeal and Social Distancing
Figure 1 presents trends in the four measures of social distancing and mobility, drawn
from the anonymized cell-phone geotagged data from Safegraph, for both Wisconsin and its
synthetic control. 20 The synthetic control assigns weights based on close matches in each of three
days in the pre-repeal period (May 3, 7 and 12) with respect to the social distancing outcome
under consideration as well as the urbanicity rate of the state. This constructed synthetic control

18

serves as our counterfactual for trends in social distancing that would have unfolded in the
absence of Wisconsin’s Supreme Court decision.
Panel (a) plots Wisconsin and synthetic Wisconsin for the outcome of the percent of
respondents staying at home throughout the day, Panel (b) repeats this exercise for an intensity
measure capturing the median daily hours spent at home, and Panel (c) utilizes another intensity
measure, the median percent of daily hours spent at home. These analyses highlight three key
points. First, the trends in staying-at-home behaviors in Wisconsin and synthetic Wisconsin are
nearly identical and move lock-step in the pre-repeal period. Second, there is a slight declining
trend in these measures of social distancing throughout the sample period for both Wisconsin and
its control, with some intra-week variance driven by weekday vs. weekend effects. Third, there
is little evidence of any significant or substantial break in the trend or a sustained decrease in
sheltering-in-place in Wisconsin, relative to synthetic Wisconsin, after the statewide repeal.
There is some suggestive indication of dynamics in the very short run, with the percent staying at
home (and to some extent the percent of time spent at home) in Wisconsin declining by May 15th
(Friday) relative to the control; the magnitude of the effect is about 2 percentage points (about 5
percent relative to the baseline mean in the state). 21 However, sheltering-in-place quickly
rebounds over the next two days, with little discernible difference in subsequent trends between
treated Wisconsin and its synthetic control. For the last 3 days of the sample (over a week after
the SIPO was struck down), both median hours at home and median percent of time at home
experience a small decrease in Wisconsin relative to synthetic Wisconsin, though neither effect is
statistically distinguishable from zero at conventional levels.

21

Appendix Figure 3 presents the placebo tests for each of the social distancing and mobility measures. The shortterm dynamics in sheltering-at-home are more apparent here (Panels a, b and c) when contrasted against the placebo
effects. The decline in the percent staying at home and the median hours spent at home within 2 or 3 days postrepeal have one-sided, one-tailed permutation based p-values of 0.167 and 0.278, respectively.

19

Since the repeal of the statewide order allowed non-essential businesses to reopen
without restriction, we also assess effects on part-time and full-time work outside the home
(Panels d and e). As with the stay-at-home behaviors, trends in working outside the home are
virtually identical across Wisconsin and its control, both before and after the repeal, providing
extremely little evidence that the Supreme Court ruling led to any substantial or detectable
increase in mobility outside the home. 22
In Table 1, we report estimates of the average daily effect of the repeal of the state’s
SIPO on each of the social distancing measures. 23 The above discussion of the visual trends
between Wisconsin and synthetic Wisconsin prefigures the effect magnitudes and their statistical
significance reported in the table. Column (1) presents estimates of the average policy effect
over the post-repeal period, comparing Wisconsin to its synthetic control, where the synthetic
control is formed by matching on the outcome in each of three pre-treatment days (May 3, 7, and
12) and urbanicity (as presented in Figure 1). While the effects of the repeal on stay-at-home
behaviors at the intensive margin are negative, the magnitudes are not economically or
statistically significant. We also do not uncover any substantial increases in working outside the
home during the day.
The remaining columns in Table 1 assess the robustness of these findings to the choice of
observable controls and donor states. In columns (2) and (3), we show the robustness of findings
in column (1) to matching on population density and both urbanicity and population density, as
well as three pre-treatment days of social distancing data. The results are unchanged.

22

The intra-week cycle, capturing weekend vs. weekday effects, is expectedly more pronounced for outside-thehome full-time work than for part-time work.
23
Appendix Table 2 reports the donor states receiving positive weights for each analysis in Table 1.

20

To ensure that endogenous COVID-19 testing is not biasing the estimated effect of
Wisconsin’s repeal, in column (4) we supplement the matching strategy by assuring similarity
across Wisconsin and its control on testing rates across the pre-policy period, in addition to pretreatment matches on the social distancing outcome for three days (May 3, May 7 and May 12).
Given that Wisconsin’s overturning of its statewide SIPO was a policy shock, largely
unanticipated and abrupt, being a result of the state Supreme Court deeming it unconstitutional,
we are less concerned with policy endogeneity. Nevertheless, column (5) augments the
matching strategy to ensure that Wisconsin and its control also explicitly match on COVID-19
cases. The results are unchanged.
Next, we explore the sensitivity of findings to matching on similar reopening policies as
Wisconsin had in place before the Supreme Court decision, specifically opening of public parks
and limited retail openings (i.e. roadside pickup and some in-shop openings). Our findings from
this synthetic control match, shown in column (6) are generally consistent with prior estimates.
While our donor pool is restricted to states that had a statewide SIPO in place throughout
much of the sample period, one concern is that some of these states nevertheless permitted partial
re-openings of non-essential services and business or contained counties that may have permitted
limited re-openings. The endpoint of our sample period ensures that we are not capturing effects
of any other state fully reopening; nevertheless, even partial reopenings for some services and
businesses may contaminate the donor pool and bias Wisconsin’s SIPO repeal effect toward
zero. In column (7), we assess sensitivity to excluding all states from the donor pool that
permitted any partial re-opening of restaurants or bars, or contained counties (covering at least
50 percent of the state population) that permitted such partial re-opening. Our results are
unchanged.

21

Finally, in column (8), we explore the sensitivity of our findings to matching on each of
the 10 days of pre-treatment days of social distancing data. The weight of the evidence across
this matching scheme, for each of the social distancing measures, points to no significant or
meaningful increase in mobility outside the home or working outside the home.

4.2 Wisconsin’s SIPO Repeal, COVID-19 Confirmed Cases and Mortality
Our findings thus far indicate that the overturning of the statewide shelter-in-place order
in Wisconsin did not effectively lead residents to spend more time outside their homes, except
perhaps in the very immediate term following the repeal. Given the integral role played by
person-to-person contact in the infection transmission mechanism, if the lifting of the statewide
order did not lead to any substantial or sustained first-order effects in increasing mobility outside
one’s home, it would be unlikely that there would be strong effects on COVID-19 cases and
deaths. We confirm this in the next set of results.
Figure 2 visually presents effects of the repeal on confirmed cases, by graphing trends
between Wisconsin and its synthetic counterfactual. 24 Panel (a) matches on pre-treatment cases
per 100,000 population as well as urbanicity, Panel (b) augments the matching to include
COVID-19 testing rates, and Panel (c) matches on sheltering-at-home measures (in addition to
outcome matches at interim points over the pre-policy period). Finally, in Panel (d), we
explicitly match on COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in each of the 10 days prior to the
SIPO repeal in Wisconsin, effectively matching on the case growth rate. Expectedly, trends in
confirmed cases identically track across Wisconsin and synthetic Wisconsin over the entire
sample period, providing no sign that the repeal of the statewide SIPO led to any discernible

24

Appendix Table 3 reports the covariate match for the synthetic control analyses of COVID-19 cases and deaths.

22

increase in confirmed infections. Estimates in Panel I of Table 2 largely confirm these
findings. 25
One concern regarding the lack of any strong effects for COVID-19 cases is that the postrepeal sample period might not be sufficiently long enough as of yet to detect a resurgence or
increase in the infection rates. While this is a possibility, we note that our sample includes 14
days of data following the revocation of the statewide SIPO. The median incubation period for
COVID-19 is 5.1 days, with 75 percent of all infected individuals seeing symptoms within 6.7
days and 97.5 percent seeing symptoms in 11.5 days (Li et al. 2020). Prior work has uncovered
strong effects of shelter-in-place orders on confirmed cases within five to ten days following the
adoption of the policy (Friedson et al. 2020; Dave et al. 2020 a, b; Courtemanche et al. 2020).
Hence, if there are any meaningful changes in COVID-19 cases as a result of the repeal, our
post-repeal window of 14 days is long enough to be able to capture them.
Is it possible that the lack of an effect of the SIPO repeal on social distancing and cases is
due to the original SIPO not being effective in driving social distancing and containment of cases
in Wisconsin? That is, if the original statewide order was ineffective, then its repeal would likely
be policy neutral and also expected to have no major impact. This explanation is unlikely for
two reasons. First, there is consistent evidence in the literature that SIPOs have been effective in
reducing the growth in COVID-19 cases and mortality (Friedson et al. 2020; Dave et al. 2020 a,
b; Courtemanche et al. 2020), particularly among states and localities that act early. Wisconsin
was among the early adopters, enacting its statewide order on March 26, relatively early during
its outbreak cycle – precisely the conditions under which statewide SIPOs have been found to

25

Appendix Table 4 reports the donor states receiving positive weights for each analysis in Table 2.

23

reap the largest public health benefits (Dave et al. 2020a). 26 Second, when we compare
Wisconsin to synthetic Wisconsin over the period that enveloped the initial SIPO adoption
(March 15 through May 9) but predated the repeal, we find strong evidence that the statewide
SIPO was effective in reducing COVID-19 cases (see Appendix Figure 4). In fact, the statewide
shelter-in-place order significantly flattened the growth curve in WI relative to its counterfactual,
and is predicted to have reduced the number of cases by 300 per 100,000 as of May 9.
As we do not find any strong effects on COVID-19 cases, we would not expect any
effects on mortality, which operates with an even longer lag given the amount of time from
exposure to presentation of symptoms to acute respiratory distress and hospitalization to death.
Panel II of Table 2 confirms that there are no significant or meaningful effects on mortality as a
result of the repeal. Trends in Figure 3 confirm this pattern of mortality results.

4.3 Heterogeneity in the Effects of the Supreme Court Repeal
Given consistent evidence across all sets of models and outcomes that the state Supreme
Court’s overturning of the shelter-in-place order, on average, had no major effect on mobility
outside the home or on COVID-related health measures, we next assess whether this average
policy response is masking heterogeneity across important margins that vary spatially. We
present these results in Table 3, based on the difference-in-differences setup (equations 1 and 2)
applied to county-by-day data. Controls are drawn from states in the donor pool, which received
positive weights and were part of the construction of the counterfactual under the synthetic
control approach.

26

When Wisconsin implemented its statewide shelter-in-place order, it had 12 (per 100,000 population) confirmed
cases compared to the national average at the time of 27 cases (per 100,000).

24

Panel I presents the baseline estimates, based on equation (1). They suggest some
negative effects on stay-at-home behaviors at the intensive margin, though the effects are small
and not statistically significant. 27 We note that because we draw inferences based on the
demanding permutation-grounded rank tests, achieving statistical significance at conventional
levels is not possible given the limited number of states that drive the analyses (WI + control
states). For instance, percent of time spent at home declines in Wisconsin by 0.94 percentage
points (or 1 percent relative to the mean stay-at-home full-time behavior); given that the effect in
Wisconsin was fourteenth largest when compared with the 17 placebo effects, the implied pvalue is .777 (or 14/18).
Most of the counties that extended their SIPO, in response to the Supreme Court’s
decision, did so only temporarily for a few days, as a stop-gap measure designed to give
residents and businesses a chance to prepare for the re-opening. Five counties, however,
extended their localized order for longer, until the original expiration date of the statewide SIPO
or until further notice by the county health department; for these counties. For these counties,
their local SIPO was still in effect for residents as of the end or our sample period. Appendix
Figure 5 shows the growth in cases across these sets of counties, prior to the repeal, and do not
show any systematic difference between counties that extended their local orders and those that
undertook no response.
In Panel II, we assess whether Wisconsinites residing in the 58 counties, that accepted the
Supreme Court’s cancellation of the SIPO, responded any differently from those residing in the
other 14 counties, which had countered the ruling by extending their local orders. Judging from
the patterns and effect magnitudes, there is some suggestive evidence that time spent at home

27

Estimates from models that alternately control for state-linear trends are presented in Appendix Table 5. The
results are largely unaffected.

25

declined more for the bound counties relative to the counties that had extended their local orders
and tried to mitigate the impact of the ruling. Median percent of time spent at home decreased
by 1.5 percentage points in the non-extending counties, compared with a 0.3 percentage point
decline among residents in counties that extended the local SIPO.
In Panel III of Table 3, we specifically consider if there are differential responses across
these five counties versus the remaining 67 counties that lost SIPO coverage right away or within
a few days of the Supreme Court ruling. Judging only for the effect magnitudes, time spent at
home falls somewhat more among the 67 counties that lifted their SIPO circa the Supreme Court
repeal than for the five counties that are still covered by local orders; the effects however are still
small overall and not precisely estimated. And, we find no evidence that COVID-19 case growth
grew more substantially in those Wisconsin counties where the Supreme Court decision was
fully binding.
As an alternative approach for addressing the fact that certain Wisconsin counties were
more fully bound by the Supreme Court decision that others, we create a “Bound Wisconsin”
jurisdiction comprised of the 58 counties of Wisconsin for which the court order applied during
the sample period. Then we use the donor pool of SIPO states to match our bound treatment
state. As the results in Figure 4 show, while there are some small declines in staying-at-home in
Wisconsin relative to its counterfactual, these estimates do not achieve statistical significance.
We continue to find no substantial increases or acceleration in the trend of COVID-19 cases

26

(Figure 5) or deaths in Wisconsin (Figure 6) following the repeal. 28, 29 As discussed above, the
absence of a subsequent effect of the repeal for “bound Wisconsin counties” is not because there
was no initial effect of the statewide SIPO. Appendix Figure 6 confirms that staying-at-home
full-time increased significantly after the initial statewide order among these 58 counties, which
were bound later by the Supreme Court ruling. Moreover, COVID-19 case growth among these
58 counties had significantly and substantially flattened in response to the original statewide
order.
Next, we assess whether the essentially null effects we find in relation to the repeal in
Wisconsin are conflating differential effects across urban and non-urban areas. On the one hand,
opportunities for mobility outside the home and options for economic and non-economic
activity, which may drive such mobility, are larger in urban areas. This may lead to a decline in
social distancing in urbanized counties upon the revocation of a SIPO. However, a higher
perceived risk of infections in urban areas may also moderate this response. Furthermore, if
urbanicity is correlated with political preference, this may further lead to differential responses,
an issue we return to below. Similar considerations warrant an exploration in differences in the
effects across population density. Panels IV and V present these results, comparing policy
responses across urbanized vs. non-urbanized counties, and across densely vs. sparsely populated

28
In Appendix Table 6A and 6B, we replicate our main analyses using only within-Wisconsin variation, driven by
the county-level counters to the lifting of the state order. While this variation appears to be orthogonal to pre-repeal
growth rates across extending and non-extending counties (which we expect given that they were mostly imposed as
a stop-gap measure rather than in response to health trends; see Appendix Figure 5), we interpret these results with
some caution. The within-Wisconsin analyses serve two purposes. First, this can yield greater identifying variation
and statistical power, improving the precision of the estimates. Second, given findings across the board from the
cross-state analyses of no substantial impact on social distancing or health outcomes, we want to confirm that these
effects are not masking important intra-state effects and that a within-state analysis also leads to similar results.
While we find evidence that SIPO expiration increased mobility outside the home, from the lifting of a county-level
SIPO, with the effects more precisely estimated in these analyses, the effect magnitudes are fairly small (Appendix
Table 6A). The decrease in stay-at-home behaviors does not translate into any large or discernible increase in
confirmed COVID-19 infections or deaths (Appendix Table 6B).
29
Appendix Tables 7 and 8 show point estimates and permutation-based p-values for our synthetic control estimates
for “Bound Wisconsin,” confirming the pattern of results described in Figures 4 through 6.

27

counties in Wisconsin. These estimates indicate a somewhat larger reduction in percent of time
spent at home in non-urbanized counties relative to urban counties (1.6 percentage points vs. 0.7
percent point, daily). However, the patterns for median hours spent at home are not consistent.
The U.S. response to the COVID-19 outbreak, to some extent, has been divided along
partisan lines (Simonov et al. 2020). In Panel VI, we therefore assess if there are differential
responses in stay-at-home behaviors based on ideology, as measured by the share of Trump
voters in the county. Here we find some evidence that counties, in which the majority of voters
voted for Trump, experienced somewhat larger declines in stay-at-home behaviors (time spent at
home) relative to counties in which the share of votes for Trump was below 50 percent. This is
consistent with research indicating that individuals residing in counties with a higher share of
Trump voters are less likely to engage effort in searching for information on the coronavirus and
follow social distancing guidelines (Barrios and Hochberg 2020).
Despite dome evidence of heterogeneous effects on social distancing by urbanicity and
population density, the results shown in columns (6) and (7) provide no consistent or meaningful
differences in the effects on COVID-19 cases or mortality across political margins. 30

5. Conclusion
Isolating the causal effect of SIPO repeal on COVID-19-related health is quite difficult
due to policymakers’ explicit linking of COVID-19 case growth to SIPO lifting. The sudden and
largely unanticipated removal of Wisconsin’s SIPO by the Wisconsin Legislature v. Palm

30

In Appendix Table 9A and 9B, we revisit heterogeneity in the policy response with the within-state difference-indifferences models. Given some indication of the dynamics in the policy response (Appendix Table 6A and 6B) and
variation in the length of time that the county extensions remained in effect, these models separate out effects across
margins that vary at the county level and across timing windows. Our results are, in the main, consistent with our
heterogeneity analysis that incorporates the donor pool in the analysis.

28

decision created a unique opportunity to examine removal of a SIPO that was not explicitly
contingent on pre-existing trends in COVID-19 caseloads. The laboratory provided by Wisconsin
is perhaps the best opportunity to-date to credibly study the effects of lifting a SIPO.
We find that the removal of the SIPO had only modest effects on measures of social
distancing behavior, causing individuals to venture outside of their homes more often. Other
measures of distancing were unaffected. These increases in mobility were somewhat larger in
more densely populated areas, and in locations that disproportionately supported President
Trump in the 2016 presidential election. These findings were not due to some counties enacting
their own SIPOs after the statewide order was struck down.
This is evidence that the effect of lifting a SIPO is not necessarily symmetric to that of
first enacting the order. 31 For example, mobility outside of one’s home is a function of many
factors, including risk perceptions and knowledge of risk mitigation behavior can change over
time. SIPOs may have been enacted during a time where people perceived little risk and knew
little about proper protective behavior (such as wearing masks), binding in a powerful way to
curb socially driven infection. Then, SIPOs might be lifted at later times after perceptions and
behavior have had a chance to adjust, meaning that individuals might engage in more social
distancing behavior even without the presence of the policy. Thus, in the case of Wisconsin, it is
possible that the policy may have been far less binding at the time it was struck down. There are
of course other factors that could be at play, such as outside options for economic and noneconomic activity worsening due to the outbreak.
We also do not find any discernible or substantial increase in COVID-19 cases or
acceleration in the growth of cases due to the Wisconsin Legislature v. Palm decision during the

enactment of Wisconsin’s statewide SIPO.

29

fortnight following its issuance. This is due at least in part to the lack of large change in social
distancing behavior, and may also be explained by individuals successfully engaging in
avoidance behaviors on other margins (such as maintaining 6 foot distances from other when out
in public or wearing masks). These findings cast doubt on the assertion that reopening states by
lifting SIPOs will necessarily cause substantial erosion in the containment of the virus. Lifting
SIPOs only means that individuals regain the right to engage in certain public behaviors. This
does not mean that individuals will exercise that right, and does not mean that if they do, that
they will not do so responsibly.
There are a few important limitations of our study worthy of note. First, we note that
future researchers will be limited in examining longer-run impacts of the Wisconsin Supreme
Court decision. As more states repeal their orders (the District of Columbia, Illinois, North
Carolina, and Ohio have lifted their orders during the week of May 22-29), the donor pool of
SIPO states will shrink and the quality of the pre-treatment match for Wisconsin will diminish.
Thus, it is fair to say that the short-run effects of the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision will be
easier to isolate than its longer-run effects. However, we emphasize that prior studies of the case
effects of SIPOs have found that such divergence in trends begins 5 to 7 days following
enactment, so we are fairly confident that our research design would have identified the
beginnings of such a trend divergence. Second, the Wisconsin experience may not generalize to
all states, limiting our study’s external validity. Still, we believe that the gains from greater
internal validity will be very valuable for future policymakers assessing the potential asymmetric
effects of SIPO lifting and adoption.

Notes: Regressions include Wisconsin and each donor state that included positive weights greater than 0.01. The weights are generated by multiplying share of
state population by the synthetic weights. All estimates include: an indicator for whether retail store and restaurant or bar reopened, an indicator for whether
personal or pet care services reopened, an indicator for whether entertainment and physical activity facilities reopened, log testing, county and day fixed effects.
P-values, generated using permutation test, are reported inside brackets.

Notes: Regressions include Wisconsin and each donor state that included positive weights greater than 0.1. The weights are generated by multiplying share of
state population by the synthetic weights. All estimates include: an indicator for whether retail store and restaurant or bar reopened, an indicator for whether
personal or pet care services reopened, an indicator for whether entertainment and physical activity facilities reopened, log testing, state-specific linear time
trends, county and day fixed effects. P-values, generated using permutation test, are reported inside brackets.
