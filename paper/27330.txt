ABSTRACT
We analyze the supply-side disruptions associated with Covid-19 across firms and workers. To
do so, we exploit differences in the ability of workers across industries to work remotely using
data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). We find that sectors in which a higher
fraction of the workforce is not able to work remotely experienced significantly greater declines
in employment, significantly more reductions in expected revenue growth, worse stock market
performance, and higher expected likelihood of default. In terms of individual employment
outcomes, lower-paid workers, especially female workers with young children, were significantly
more affected by these disruptions. Last, we combine these ex-ante heterogeneous industry
exposures with daily financial market data to create a stock return portfolio that most closely
replicate the supply-side disruptions resulting from the pandemic.

The Covid-19 pandemic of 2020 has led to severe disruptions to the supply-side of the
world economy as entire sectors shut down. In the first quarter of 2020, US gross domestic
output fell by 4.8 percent in annualized terms, a decline not seen since the Great Recession.
This drop underestimates the full economic impact of the pandemic since the severity of the
crisis became fully apparent to the public and private sector only in the last few weeks of
March. Moreover, the effect has been highly asymmetric: restaurants, entertainment, and
travel services suffered significantly more than food or technology services. Naturally, these
declines reflect not only the supply side disruptions due to the effect of the lockdown but
also demand-side factors, including the collapse of global consumer demand and expectations
of future government policy. This confluence of adverse forces obscures the direct effects of
the supply-side disruptions of the pandemic.
Our goal is to isolate the supply side effects from other forces. Our starting point is
that industries in which a higher fraction of the labor force can work remotely are likely to
experience less severe disruptions in their business operations. We build on existing work
and construct a metric of industry exposure to the lockdowns using information on the
share of the workforce than can work from home (Dingel and Neiman, 2020; Alon, Doepke,
Olmstead-Rumsey, and Tertilt, 2020). Specifically, we follow Alon et al. (2020) and exploit
data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) in 2017 and 2018, in which workers disclose
the extent to which they are able to and have historically had experience working remotely.
As noted by Alon et al. (2020), occupations vary immensely by whether people report they
are able to telecommute—ranging from 3% for transportation and material moving to 78%
for computer programmers. We then aggregate these survey responses to build measures of
exposure across industries and groups of workers.
In brief, our assumption is that the extent to which firms are able to effectively continue
their business operations during the pandemic depends on whether workers can perform
their tasks remotely. As such, our measure of supply side disruption for a given industry,
termed “Covid-19 work exposure”, is equal to one minus the fraction of workers that have
telecommuted – more specifically, the fraction that have ever worked full days from home
– in each industry. Importantly, there is considerable dispersion in our exposure measure
across industries. For example, software publishers (NAICS 5112) have an exposure of just
0.38, since much of the production work can be done remotely; by contrast, meat production
(NAICS 3116) or general merchandise stores (NAICS 4523) have an exposure close to one,
since most of the employees cannot perform their work remotely.
In addition, government restrictions also play a role in firms’ ability to continue operations.
Specifically, local governments typically deem certain industries as ‘critical’, namely those
1

that provide ‘essential infrastructure’. Thus, we also manually classify some industries as
‘essential’. Since the definition of essential industries varies greatly across states, we aim
to be conservative, classifying as essential industries related to the production and sale of
food and beverages; utilities; pharmacies; transportation; waste collection and disposal; and
some healthcare and financial services. Data on foot-traffic from SafeGraph validate our
construction: establishments in industries deemed critical experience significantly smaller
declines in traffic than establishments in non-critical industries, which stands in stark contrast
to nearly identical trends in foot traffic in January-February 2020.
Armed with a measure of industry exposure to these supply-side disruptions, we can
isolate these effects from other economic forces that would otherwise affect these sets of firms
symmetrically. Our summary finding is that these supply-side disruptions are economically
large.
Our first set of results concerns employment outcomes. We find that sectors with a larger
fraction of workers who cannot work remotely—higher Covid-19 work exposure—experienced
significantly larger declines in employment than sectors where more of the workforce can
perform tasks remotely. The differences are economically sizable: a one-standard-deviation
increase in our Covid-19 work exposure measure is associated with an approximately 8 percent
larger decline in employment; the differences among sectors is starker when we restrict the
sample to non-critical industries (13 percent). We also find some evidence for heterogeneous
effects across workers. Specifically, a given increase in our Covid-19 work exposure measure is
associated with a somewhat greater increase in the probability of non-employment for women
and lower-earning workers. Among all affected groups, we find that the employment status
of female workers with young children and without a college degree is most sensitive: in the
cross-section of workers, a one-standard-deviation increase in our Covid-19 work exposure
measure is associated with a 15 percent probability of non-employment for these workers,
which is more than three times the magnitude of the baseline coefficient.
Our second set of results focuses on firm outcomes. Given the delays in the availability of
real data on firm outcomes, we focus on a set of forward-looking variables that capture future
expectations. That is, we focus on the revisions in analyst forecasts of expected revenue
growth; the stock market performance of publicly traded firms; and the expected probability
of default. We find that firms in sectors that are more likely to experience work disruptions
also fare significantly worse during the 2020 pandemic: a one-standard-deviation increase
in our Covid-19 exposure metric is associated with a 8 percent decline in analysts’ revenue
forecasts for Q2; a 0.22 percentage point increase in the probability of default over the next 6
months; and a 7 percent decline in stock market performance to date. These magnitudes
2

account for a significant share of cross-industry differences in outcomes during this period.
Last, while financial analysts expect the worst effects to be short-lived, our work exposure
variable is still a significant predictor of differences in expected revenue growth over the
next two years—though magnitudes are significantly muted. Similar patterns emerge in the
differences in projected declines in revenue across non-critical versus critical industries, where
we find that analysts project firms in non-critical industries’ annual revenues to decline by
13, 10, and 8 percent for 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. These same differences are 3.2,
2.5, and 2.3 percent for firms in critical industries.
In the last part of the paper, we use some of these forward-looking variables to construct
a real-time indicator of supply-side disruptions. In particular, we use daily data on stock
returns to construct a portfolio that is maximally exposed to the Covid-19 work disruption
using the methodology of Fama and MacBeth (1973). The resulting ‘Covid-19’ factor has
a long-short portfolio interpretation. It overweights industries whose workers cannot work
remotely and underweights industries whose workers can perform their tasks from home. As
of May 15, 2020, this portfolio had lost roughly 50 percent of its value since the beginning
of the year—compared to 10 percent for the broad market index. Naturally, reversing this
investment strategy would deliver a portfolio that could significantly hedge future Covid-19
related uncertainty.
In sum, our work contributes to the voluminous economics literature that has emerged in
response to the pandemic. The key differentiator of our work is its focus on isolating the
supply side disruptions associated with Covid-19. By contrast, existing work has focused
on the overall response of the economy during this period.1 How firms respond during the
pandemic is a function of both the underlying supply-side disruptions (our focus) but also
firms’ exposures to a decline in consumer demand as a result of expected income losses and
increase in uncertainty. Our goal is to isolate the former rather the latter channel. In this
respect, our work is closer to Bonadio, Huo, Levchenko, and Pandalai-Nayar (2020) who
focus on the role of global supply chains; or Hassan, Hollander, van Lent, and Tahoun (2020)
who identify differences in firms’ exposure based on the transcript of analyst calls.
Last, our paper is related to recent work by Dingel and Neiman (2020), Alon et al. (2020)
and Mongey, Pilossoph, and Weinberg (2020). Dingel and Neiman (2020) construct measures

of the feasibility of workers to work from home, but they do so using task descriptions in the
ONET survey. Like us, Alon et al. (2020) construct a measure based on workers’ answers
to the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). Though the details of the construction differ,
the main idea is similar. Dingel and Neiman (2020) and Alon et al. (2020) mainly focus on
demographic differences among workers who can and cannot work remotely; by contrast, we
are interested in how the ability to work from home is related to outcomes. In this respect,
our work is closest to Mongey et al. (2020), who explore how the Dingel and Neiman (2020)
measure and a measure of occupations requiring high physical proximity relate to differential
outcomes across workers. Though the first part of our analysis also explores worker-level
outcomes, our primary focus is on firms. In this regard, we view our work as complementary.

Measuring Exposures of Production to Covid

We begin with a brief description of our construction of exposure measures from the data.

1.1

Workers’ ability to work remotely

Following the rapid increase in cases throughout the US, many employers as well as state and
local governments quickly imposed restrictions requiring that workers stay at home, leading
to what is essentially the largest global experiment in telecommuting in human history. Our
starting point is the simple premise that supply-side disruptions are likely to be more severe
in occupations/industries for which workers have had little to no ability to or experience with
telework in the past. Accordingly, our measure of industry exposure to work disruptions due
to Covid-19 builds on Alon et al. (2020), who use data from the Leave and Job Flexibilities
module of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) in 2017 and 2018 (n = 10, 040), which
asks several questions about workers’ ability and past experiences with working from home.
Our preferred measure utilizes responses to two different questions, though the module also
includes several additional questions about reasons for and frequency of remote work. We
obtain the ATUS microdata from IPUMS.2
Crucially, the survey draws a distinction between workers who are able or unable to
telecommute, as opposed to actually regularly telecommuting, as the former is the relevant
metric during a pandemic.3 The output of this procedure is an occupation/industry-level

3
For example, the Census’ American Community Survey asks whether workers worked from home last
week, which captures regular telecommuting behavior. According to the Census Bureau, around 4.3% of

4

metric of the fraction of workers in each occupation that should in principle be able to work
from home. The first major question asks for a yes/no reply to the prompt: “As part of your
(main) job, can you work at home?” Using the survey’s person weights, approximately 78%
of households answer yes to this question. Alon et al. (2020) construct a measure of telework
experience by identifying the share of workers in a given occupation that, according to their
answers to this question, are able to telecommute, and provide several facts about the share
of workers in various demographic groups which are employed in occupations which can be
performed from home.
Our preferred measure also makes use of responses to one additional question, “Are there
days when you work only at home?”, which is only asked to those who say that they are
able to work from home. Around 51% of households who are able to work from home also
indicate that they have worked days entirely from home. In our view, answering this question
in the affirmative provides a sharper classification of workers who will more likely be able to
perform the majority of their job responsibilities from home, as opposed to only a subset
of tasks (e.g., answering emails/phone calls) remotely. For example, 64% of computer and
information systems managers (occupation 110) say that they can work from home, and 47%
of them have worked days entirely from home. These same proportions are 59% and just
13%, respectively, for medical and health services managers (occupation 350), a group that,
in our view, is a part of a population which is more likely to be unable to work full-time from
home as effectively.4
In brief, we classify a surveyed worker as ‘able to work from home’ if they answer ‘yes’ to
both questions above. We then compute measures of industry and occupation exposure by
aggregating these survey responses across employees according to the industry and occupation
codes which appear in the ATUS. In brief, our measure of industry exposure is
Covid-19 Work ExposureI = 1 − % of workers able to work from homeI ,

(1)

which is computed as a weighted average of individual-level responses aggregated so as to be
nationally representative using the BLS’ person weights. If fewer than 5 survey respondents
workers worked from home according to this measure in 2010 (Mateyka, Rapino, and Landivar, 2012).
4
As further evidence of a sharper distinction, among households who provide non-missing replies to the
question “What is the main reason why you work at home?”, 60% of households who have worked days
only from home are about twice as likely to list “job requires working at home”, “reduce commuting time or
expense”, or “personal preference”, which is significantly higher than the 31% frequency for other workers (t
statistic on difference = 12.1). By way of contrast, in the group of workers who say that they have worked
from home but have never worked days only from home, the most common answer to this question is “finish
or catch up on work”, which is selected 36% of the time, a significantly higher than the 14% of the time for
those who have worked days from home (t=7.3).

are directly employed in a given Census industry, we instead extrapolate using a weighted
average of occupation-based measures.5 Given that an individual’s occupation likely provides
a more accurate description of the types of tasks that a worker performs on a daily basis,
we elect to use the occupation-based measure in person-level regressions below—though we
obtain similar results if we use the industry-based measure. In general, we also find similar
results if we use the more inclusive Alon et al. (2020) measure instead.
As most of our outcomes by industry use NAICS-based classifications, we crosswalk
between the ATUS industry codes and NAICS industries.6 We aggregate most outcomes,
when available, to the 4-digit NAICS level given that the industry codes available in the
IPUMS ATUS extract roughly correspond with this level of aggregation.
We find that most industries are highly exposed; the mean value of the measure is
approximately 85%. Yet, there is considerable dispersion across NAICS industries—the
cross-sectional standard deviation of our measure across 4-digit NAICS industries is approximately 17%. Clearly, some industries are more exposed than others. For example, General
Merchandise Stores (NAICS 4523) and Meat Production (NAICS 3116) have an exposure
measure of close to 1, since almost none of the workers in that industry report that they can
work from home. By contrast, Software Publishers (NAICS 5112) is an industry in which the
vast majority of workers report they can work from home, and accordingly has an exposure
of just 0.38.
In addition, we perform some manual adjustments to the ATUS work exposure measure.
For certain industries, we set their work from home exposure to 1, giving them “full exposure.”
These are largely industries that have been almost completely shut down and thus, even if
some of their workers have the flexibility to be able to work from home in normal times,
they cannot continue business as usual during lockdowns in a pandemic. These industries
include: 4811 Scheduled Air Transportation, 5121 Motion Picture and Video Industries, 5151
Radio and Television Broadcasting, 5615 Travel Arrangement and Reservation Services, 7111
Performing Arts Companies, 7112 Spectator Sports, 7113 Promoters of Performing Arts,
Sports, and Similar Events, 7114 Agents and Managers for Artists, Athletes, Entertainers,
and Other Public Figures, 7131 Amusement Parks and Arcades.
5

Specifically, we use data from the (considerably larger) 2016 American Community Survey to estimate
the share of employees for each occupation by industry. We choose 2016 so that the occupation and industry
codes coincide with those used in ATUS. American Community data are also taken from IPUMS: Steven
Ruggles, Sarah Flood, Ronald Goeken, Josiah Grover, Erin Meyer, Jose Pacas and Matthew Sobek. IPUMS

1.2

Critical Industries

While policy responses to the Covid-19 crisis have imposed severe restrictions on interactions
between individuals, governments have found it necessary to make some exceptions, thus
creating a need to classify industries as essential or non-essential. The Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provided guidelines to states about what kinds
businesses should remain open. Keeping track of essential industries can enhance our analysis
of work from home exposure because if a business is allowed to stay open, then it may be
irrelevant if their workers can telecommute. We start with Pennsylvania’s guidelines largely
because they provide a list, based on the CISA guidance, of essential industries at the 4 digit
NAICS (2017) level.7 These industries primarily correspond to the production and sale of
food and beverages; utilities; pharmacies; transportation; waste collection and disposal; and
some healthcare and financial services.
While CISA’s essential industry classification is a good place to start, we alter it for
two basic reasons. First the classification of essential industries seems too coarse in certain
cases. For instance, the NAICS code 4831 is “Deep Sea, Coastal, and Great Lakes Water
Transportation” and is listed as essential by Pennsylvania. While some of the firms in
this industry are shipping companies, the largest firms in this industry are cruise ships,
which clearly have not been permitted to maintain business as usual. Second, the CISA
list was somewhat inclusive in what types of industries were classified as providing critical
infrastructure. We therefore removed from the critical list industries that faced severe
restrictions to operating at a scale close to or even higher than pre-pandemic baselines. For
example, restaurants, restaurant suppliers, and airlines have been permitted to remain open,
however their patronage has declined dramatically due to quarantines and heavy restrictions
on domestic and international passenger travel. While some restaurants remained open
for curbside and/or takeout service, it is apparent that they were not classified as critical.
Accordingly, we have also classified industries that are auxiliary to such industries (such as
firms in NAICS code 4244 , Grocery and Related Product Merchant Wholesalers, which
largely deliver food supplies to restaurants) as non-critical.
Given that we exclude the list of critical industries from the bulk of our empirical analysis,
our choices of narrowing down the critical industry list can be viewed as conservative.8

As there are 311 industries represented by NAICS-4 codes, we will not to attempt to explain our
justification by industry, but hope to provide some clarification on our thought process, which is primarily
disciplined by the CISA guidance. In the case of manufacturing, for example, the CISA guidelines state that

1.3

Validations using Foot Traffic Data

We validate our critical/non-critical industry classification and remote work exposure measures
using weekly foot traffic data from SafeGraph.9 SafeGraph collects anonymized information
on location activity from a large panel of mobile devices. For more than 5 million points of
interest (POIs), we can observe aggregated daily activity of users in the panel. As activity
exhibits strong within-week seasonal patterns, we aggregate the data to the weekly level.
Given our focus on workers’ ability to telecommute, we focus on visits to POIs that last for 4
hours or more, which we will refer to as “worker foot traffic”.10 For each 4-digit industry,
we compare activity in week t with a baseline level of average activity: the mean of weekly
activity over the period beginning with the week of January 6-12 and ending with the week
of February 10-16. In the baseline period, the median 4-digit NAICS industry receives 18,705
worker visits per week, and the distribution of activity is highly right skewed, with the 90th,
95th and 99th percentiles having 560 thousand, 1.03 million, and 5.60 million hits respectively.
If our critical industry classification is accurate, we would expect to see a significantly
smaller decline in foot traffic in critical industries than in non-critical ones —starting from
the middle of March 2020 when Covid-19 awareness and state-mandated lockdowns went into
effect. To test this hypothesis, we then aggregate foot traffic across all POIs to the 4-digit
the following workers should be deemed critical: ”Workers necessary for the manufacturing of metals (including
steel and aluminum), industrial minerals, semiconductors, materials and products needed for medical supply
chains and for supply chains associated with transportation, aerospace, energy, communications, information
technology, food and agriculture, chemical manufacturing, nuclear facilities, wood products, commodities used
as fuel for power generation facilities, the operation of dams, water and wastewater treatment, processing
and reprocessing of solid waste, emergency services, and the defense industrial base... ” (p. 17)
As steel and aluminum are mentioned explicitly and directly correspond to NAICS-4 codes 3312 (”Steel
Product Manufacturing from Purchased Steel”) and 3313 (”Alumina and Aluminum Production and Processing”), we have included those as critical. We also deemed Soap, Cleaning Compound, and Toilet Preparation
Manufacturing (3256), Pharmaceutical and Medicine Manufacturing (3254), Plastics Product Manufacturing
(3261), Agriculture, Construction, and Mining Machinery Manufacturing (3331), and Medical Equipment
and Supplies Manufacturing (3391) as critical, as these clearly fall under the jurisdiction of the quoted CISA
guideline. However, as most other manufacturing NAICS-4 codes represent industries that manufacture both
products that would fit into the above categories as well as those that would not, we have largely chosen to
designate the remainder of the manufacturing industries as non-critical.

We are grateful to SafeGraph for making the data freely available to our research team and the
broader community for Covid-19 related work. Further information about the data are available here:
https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/weekly-patterns. See also, e.g., Mongey et al. (2020) and Farboodi,
Jarosch, and Shimer (2020) for additional applications of SafeGraph data to the study of Covid-19.
10
Specifically, SafeGraph makes available data on number of visits by “bucketed dwell time”, which captures
the length of time that a device is at each POI. Consistent with the recommendations of SafeGraph researchers,
we scale total weekly activity by a moving average the total number of devices in the panel over the prior
week for each point of interest prior to aggregating.

(2)

When estimating (2), we weigh observations by total industry employment, and, to minimize
the effect of outliers, we winsorize these industry indices at the 1st and 99th percentiles.11
Figure 2 plots the results. Panel A reports average levels of our activity indices for
critical and non-critical indices, respectively, along with 95% confidence intervals. Both
sets of industries followed essentially identical trends in January and early February, then
experienced a significant decline in foot traffic which dramatically accelerated in the middle
of March of 2020. Though the Covid-19 pandemic affected almost all establishments, we can
see that the decline is smaller for industries classified as critical. Panel B compares differences
in traffic between the two industries by plotting the estimated coefficient βt in equation (2)
above. It shows that this decline was significantly smaller, by around 20%, for industries that
we identified as providing critical infrastructure. We interpret these results as supporting our
industry classification into ‘critical’ and ‘non-critical’ industries.
Our foot traffic data also permit a simple validation of our remote exposure measure.
Our hypothesis is that, even in critical industries, workers would prefer to work from home
to minimize their exposures to the disease to the extent that such activities are feasible.
Whereas workers in non-critical industries are essentially prevented from going to their
workplaces during, the decision to telework is more discretionary in nature for workers in
critical industries. Accordingly, we would expect to see larger declines in worker foot traffic
(ie increased telecommuting) in critical industries for which workers are more easily able to
telework. To test this premise, we estimate the following specification for critical (panel C)
and non-critical (panel D) industries,

where our prediction is that γt > 0 since workers in critical, high exposure industries will be
more likely to go to work relative to their counterparts who can telecommute more easily.
Panel C provides strong evidence in support of this hypothesis: a 1% increase in the fraction
of workers who cannot work remotely is associated with between 1-1.5% higher foot traffic
11
Some industries have very sparse coverage in the pre-period, so drop the approximately 5% industries with
fewer than 30 average worker hits per week, though our results are insensitive to increasing this threshold or
eliminating it entirely. Total NAICS4 employment is taken from the Census’ 2017 Statistics of United States

throughout the month of April. In contrast, exposure is not correlated with changes in foot
traffic in non-critical industries, which is consistent with the non-critical distinction requiring
all workers to work remotely regardless of feasibility constraints.

1.4

Descriptive Facts

Figure 1 plots the distribution of the measure across NAICS4 industries. We report results
separately for critical and non-critical industries. We note that most industries have relatively
high values of Covid-19 work exposure; the average is equal to approximately 0.85 for critical
and 0.87 for non-critical industries. More importantly, however, we see there is considerable
dispersion in our measure—the cross-sectional standard deviation is approximately 17.4%.
The bulk of our paper explores the extent to which these cross-sectional differences are
predictive of differential economic outcomes during the pandemic.
Table 1 illustrates how our industry Covid-19 work exposure measure is related to firm
characteristics; due to data availability, we restrict attention to publicly-listed firms. Panel A
shows results for all industries, while Panel B restricts to the non-critical industry sub-sample.
Two patterns stand out. First, we see that firms in the high-exposure category tend to be
larger. For instance, focusing on the sub-sample of non-critical industries, the median firm
in the top quartile of the Covid-19 work exposure measure has 4.9 thousand employees; by
comparison, the median firm in the bottom quartile has 1.5 thousand employees. Second,
there is some evidence that firms in the least exposed industries have more intangibles than
firms in the most exposed industries: these firms have higher market valuations (median
Tobin’s Q of 2.3 for the most exposed vs 1.3 for the least exposed); have lower ratios of
physical capital (PPE) to book assets (0.16 vs 0.58); and spend significantly more on R&D
and SG&A than firms in the most exposed industries.12 This is consistent with the view that
firms with more intangibles have more jobs that can be done remotely than firms that rely
more on physical assets. Last, firms in the most exposed industries are more profitable in
terms of bottom-line accounting measures (return-on-assets) but this difference is driven by
higher spending on intangibles and/or fixed costs by firms in the least exposed industries.
12

Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2009) and Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou (2013) argue that higher SG&A
expenditures are associated with higher investment in intangibles. That said, Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou
(2013) focus on within-industry differences, whereas these results reflect between-industry patterns. As such,
these differences in SG&A could also reflect differences in operating leverage (importance of fixed costs) or
differences in accounting practices.

Covid-19 Work Exposure and Economic Performance

So far, we have constructed a measure of exposure to Covid-19 work disruptions using data
from the 2017 and 2018 ATUS. Here, we explore the extent to which this Covid-19 work
exposure measure is able to predict differences in economic performance across industries
and individual workers. Our outcome variables include data on employment outcomes at the
industry and worker level, as well as forward-looking variables that are indicative of future
economic performance—stock returns; analyst forecasts; and default probabilities.
Each of these variables has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Data from financial
markets and financial analysts are forward-looking, but are only available for public firms—
which may be less exposed to supply-side disruptions than smaller private firms. Employment
data are more representative of the universe of firms, but are available with a lag and may
not accurately reflect outcomes for firm owners.

2.1

Employment

We begin by exploring the extent to which our measure of production disruption due to
the pandemic can predict differences in employment declines across industries. We use two
sources for data on employment.
First, we focus on aggregated employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
Each month, the BLS aggregates data from large surveys of firms’ establishments in order to
construct estimates of total employment by industry. We make use of data from Table B-1A
of the April employment report, which provides estimates of seasonally-adjusted employment
at the 3-digit NAICS level for the vast majority of non-agricultural industries in the US
economy.13 While BLS reports monthly data for more detailed NAICS industries, measures
for April 2020 are suppressed for a large number of the more disaggregated categories. As
such, we conduct our analysis at the 3-digit level. For purposes of this analysis, we define a
NAICS3 industry as critical if more than 50% of its pre-pandemic employment is associated
with our list of 4-digit NAICS critical industries.
We estimate the following specification
Employment GrowthI = a + β Covid-19 Work ExposureI + εI .

(4)

Here, the unit of observation is a 3-digit NAICS industry and the outcome variable is
employment growth. We examine both monthly but also annual changes—that is, between

11

either March 2020 or April 2019 and April 2020. Since the size of these industries varies
greatly, depending on the specification, we also present results in which we weight industries
using total employment as of the baseline period used in each growth rate. Last, we report
results either using the full sample, or by excluding the list of critical industries in Table A.1.
Table 2 and Figure 3 present our results. Examining columns (1) through (8) of the table,
we see an economically and statistically significant correlation between our exposure measure
and industry-wide declines in employment that is robust across different specifications. In
particular, a one-standard deviation increase in our Covid-19 work exposure measure is
associated with a 6.2 to 23.0 percent greater decline in employment. The magnitudes are
comparable when we focus on monthly or annual growth rates and are larger when we exclude
critical industries and weigh industries by their total employment. These magnitudes are
quite significant and comparable to either the average decline in employment during this
period (14 percent) or the cross-sectional standard deviation (16 percent). In panel B, we
also report the differences in average employment growth rates between industries which
we classify as critical vs non-critical. On an employment-weighted basis, monthly declines
in employment are more than 3 times larger in non-critical industries (-22.8%) relative to
critical ones (6.0%).
Figure 4, Panel A, provides a more aggregated summary of the relationship between
our exposure measure and BLS employment year-on-year employment growth. Specifically,
we aggregate across non-critical industries by major 2-digit NAICS sector. Even at this
level of aggregation, one can observe a strong relationship between exposure and changes in
employment. Unsurprisingly, the three hardest-hit sectors are retail, hotels, and entertainment,
which are also the three most highly exposed sectors according to our measure.
The recent availability of CPS data allows us to explore outcomes at the level of individual
workers. The advantage of doing so is twofold. First, by observing the characteristics of
individual workers we can control for some variables that may be correlated with our Covid-19
work exposure. For instance, workers that can work remotely tend to be in white collar
occupations (see e.g., Dingel and Neiman, 2020). By including controls for workers’ level of
education, or past earnings, we can ensure that we are comparing otherwise similar workers.
Further, analyzing outcomes for individual workers, and how these outcomes vary with
observables, reveals a fuller picture of the effects of the Covid-19 on the supply side.
We use the April version of the Current Population Survey (CPS) which contains employment information for individual workers.14 We restrict the sample to adults of working age
14
There are some possible selection issues. IPUMS notes that: “Interviews for April were conducted
exclusively by phone. The two Census Bureau call centers that usually assist with the collection of CPS data
remained closed. Response rates continued to be low in April, over 10 percentage points below the average

12

(25 to 60 years) that are present in the March 2020 survey and who report that they were
“at work last week” as of March 2020. Our sample contains 23,984 workers. In April of 2020,
19,664 out of these workers report they are at work; 2,144 report they are out of a job; while
1,257 report they have a job but were not at work last week. We include the first and last
groups in our definition of employment for our regressions below.
We impose one other substantial restriction of the sample. As of the start of the year, the
BLS changed its coding of occupations relative to prior years, and a crosswalk between the
older vintage of occupation codes from ATUS and the newer codes in the 2020 CPS has not
yet been developed. In part due to this technical reason and also given that several researchers
have already documented a disproportionate increase in unemployment for lower income
workers, we restrict attention to the subsample of workers who appear in the March/April
2020 core CPS and March 2019 Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) CPS surveys. This
enables us to construct controls for an individual’s prior income and, motivated by evidence
on potentially concentrated adverse effects for small businesses, firm size. For each worker,
we assign an exposure measure based on her March 2019 occupation which is equal to one
minus the fraction of ATUS respondents (weighted using the ATUS sampling weights) who
had worked a full day from home.15
We estimate the following specification
NotEmployedi = a + β Covid-19 Work Exposurei + c Zi + εi .

(5)

Our main outcome variable is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if the worker
was not ‘at work last week’ in the April 2020 CPS survey—which therefore includes both
unemployed and furloughed workers. For ease of interpretation, we multiply the dependent
variable by 100 to express probabilities in percentage points in tables and figures.
Since the CPS contains information on workers’ occupation, we use the occupation-level
measure of our Covid Work exposure rather than the industry aggregate—though, using
industry aggregates produces largely comparable results. Depending on the specification, the
vector of worker-level controls and interaction terms Zi includes gender dummies; college
education; whether the worker has children younger than 14 years old; education (a college
graduate dummy); worker age; worker earnings as of 2019 (quartile dummies); and firm size
(see below). Response rates continued to be particularly low among rotation groups one and five who would
have normally received a visit from the enumerator. Month-in-sample one and five response rates were similar
to those same groups in March. Additionally, those households that entered the survey for the first time in
March had a similarly low response rate for their second interview in April.”
15
Note that we also assigned an alternative measure based on each worker’s March 2020 industry and
obtain similar results.

13

dummies. We cluster the standard errors by occupation and industry (using Census codes).
Table 3 shows results.
Examining Table 3, several facts stand out. First, as we see in the first three rows
of the table, workers in occupations that are less able to work remotely (higher Covid-19
work exposure) are more likely to stop working. These effects are not absorbed by worker
characteristics—as we see in columns (2) and (3)—suggesting that our Covid-19 work exposure
measure is not simply capturing differences in the composition of the work force. Further, the
point estimates are somewhat larger for non-critical industries relative to critical industries.
Focusing on column (3)—which includes controls for worker gender, age, education, prior
earnings, and firm size—a one-standard deviation increase in our covid-19 work exposure
measure is associated with a 4.5 percentage point increase in the probability of a worker
in a non-critical industry being without employment in April 2020, compared to a 1.0
percentage point increase for a worker in a critical industry, that is however statistically not
significantly different from zero. Moreover, relative to workers in non-critical industries with
similar characteristics, employees in critical industries are 8 percentage points less likely to
remain employed. Hence, in the remainder of the paper, we restrict attention to non-critical
industries.
One potential concern with these results is that they could simply reflect differential
employment trends in white-collar versus blue-collar occupations. Column (4) of Table 3
performs a placebo exercise, in which we repeat the analysis for the February CPS sample—
well before the effects of the pandemic became apparent. Examining the results we note that
none of the coefficients of interest are statistically different from zero.
We next allow the coefficient β on the Covid-19 work exposure measure in equation (5) to
vary with worker characteristics Zi . In all specifications with interactions, we always include
dummies for all levels of the categorical variable of interest as controls. Doing so reveals
how the employment status of different workers varies in response to the same level of work
disruption due to Covid-19.16
Figure 5 summarizes our findings. In Panel A of the figure, we see an economically and
statistically significant difference in how the employment status of workers of different income
levels is related to our Covid-19 exposure measure. A one-standard deviation increase in our
work exposure measure is associated with a 9.2 percentage point increase in the likelihood of
non-employment for workers at the bottom quartile of the earnings distribution—compared
to just a 1.6 percentage point increase for workers in the top quartile. The fact that we
16
In additional specifications, we verify that many of these patterns persist even if we include occupation
and/or industry fixed effects, implying that we can detect similar differences even within occupations/industries.
These results are suppressed for brevity and are available upon request.

14

see such a differential response of employment status to the feasibility of remote work for
employees with different earnings levels has several interpretations. One possibility is that
firms try to retain their most able—and highest paid—employees and reduce employment for
workers of lower skill levels first.
Another possibility is that these responses reflect differences in age or the gender pay
gap. Panel B of the Figure shows that there is some evidence that the employment status
of younger workers responds more by approximately a factor of two than older workers to
Covid-19 work disruptions, but the coefficients are imprecisely estimated so the difference is
not statistically different from zero. Panels C and D condition on gender as well as college
attainment and whether or not the household has at least one child under the age of 14. In
both cases, we see that estimated sensitivities for women are larger relative to men, though
these differences are not always statistically significant. Workers without college degrees have
higher estimated coefficients. In panel D, we observe that whereas men with young children
and work in non-critical industries exhibit have smaller coefficients than their men without
young children, the opposite appears to be the case for women with young children. The
7.7 percentage point difference in coefficients between men and women with young children
is highly significant (t=3.4).17 Panel E shows that these gender differences do not merely
reflect the gender pay gap. More importantly though, Panel E reveals that the employment
status of female workers is more sensitive to work disruptions than the status of male workers,
for all income levels. Panel F shows that the workers most adversely affected by the work
disruptions due to Covid-19 are female workers with young children and without a college
degree. For this group, a one standard deviation increase in our Covid-19 work exposure
measure is associated with about a 15 percentage point increase in non-employment—which
is three times higher than the average response among all workers.
In sum, we find that our Covid-19 work exposure measure is an economically significant
predictor of employment. Workers in occupations that cannot work remotely are significantly
more likely to have lost their employment status in April 2020. This correlation is evident
both in cross-industry comparisons and in individual worker regressions.

2.2

Revisions in Revenue Forecasts

We next examine the ability of our measure to predict revisions in analyst forecasts regarding
the economic performance of these industries. Specifically, we use consensus forecasts of
firms’ revenues over various horizons from Capital IQ as of various points in time. We begin
17

This gap remains sizable at 5.5 percentage points when we absorb occupation fixed effects.

15

by comparing the change in revenue forecasts for the same accounting period (e.g., 2020Q2)
across two points in time, February 14 and May 15, 2020. Later, we illustrate how these
forecasts evolved on a weekly basis. We focus on forecasts horizons up to three years ahead,
that is, Q2 through Q4 of 2020, and full year forecasts for 2020–22. We use the Capital IQ
‘consensus forecast’; to minimize measurement error, we require that each firm has at least 3
individual forecasts. Due to this restriction as well as the fact that underlying forecasts are
less sparsely populated at longer horizons, we lose some industries for longer run forecasts,
especially 2022. For each firm f in the sample, we compute the percent change in revenue
forecast from February to May 2020,
Revenue forecast for Period τ , as of May 2020f
− 1.
Revenue forecast forPeriod τ , as of February 2020f

(6)

For purposes of these regressions, we winsorize firm-level measures at the 1st and 99th
percentiles, then aggregate the non-missing firm-level revenue forecasts to the 4-digit NAICS
level, weighted by the corresponding level of the firms’ February 2020 forecasts for the same
period,
Forecast

f ∈I Revenue forecast for Period τ , as of May 2020f

=P

(7)

We re-estimate equation (10), but we now replace the dependent variable with the revision
in analyst forecasts in (7)
Forecast RevisionτI = aτ + βτ Covid-19 Work Exposurei + ετi .

(8)

Our dependent variable is the revision in analysts’ revenue forecasts for period τ between
February and May 2020, aggregated to industry i. To conserve space, we focus our preferred
specification in which we restrict the sample to non-critical industries and weigh observations
by the number of Compustat employees in each industry; using equal weights or weighting
by the number of firms leads to quantitatively similar results. Standard errors are robust to
heteroskedasticity (White, 1980).
Columns (2) to (7) of Table 4 present our findings. Column (2) shows the effect of the
exposure measure on revenue forecasts revisions for Q2 2020. A one-standard deviation
increase in the exposure measure is associated with a 7.7 percent decline in analysts’ revenue
forecasts. Importantly, the effect is quite persistent, though the magnitudes do decline with
the forecast horizon τ , as we can see from comparing the magnitudes across columns. Figure 7

16

plots the estimated coefficients as a function of the forecast horizon τ . We see that financial
analysts expect the direct economic cost of the pandemic to subside significantly over the
course of 2020: a one-standard deviation increase in the exposure measure is associated with
a 3 percent decline in revenue for Q3, while the estimate for Q4 2020 is equal to -1.4 percent.
The overall estimate for 2020 is equal to 2.6 percent. Extending our analysis to 2021 and 2022,
we note that our estimates are significantly weaker at 2 and 1.5 percent, respectively—though
still statistically significant—suggesting that analysts expect the costs of these supply side
disruptions to persist for several years. Figures 4 and 6 provide scatter plots for non-critical
industries aggregated by major sector and across all 4-digit industries, respectively.
In Panel B, we also report (Compustat 2019 employment-weighted) averages of these
revenue forecasts for critical versus non-critical industries. We note that projected declines
are roughly three times larger for firms in non-critical industries relative to their counterparts
critical ones. In both cases, the largest expected declines in revenue are expected for 2020Q2
(-26% and -8% for non-critical and critical, respectively), though revenue forecasts suggest
that non-critical industries are expected to experience substantial long-run declines in output.
In particular, non-critical industries are projected to experience revenue declines of 10 percent
and 8 percent in 2021 and 2022, respectively.18

2.3

Default Probabilities

So far, we have seen that our Covid-19 work exposure measure predicts declines in both
employment declines as well as expected revenue across industries. We next examine another
forward-looking measure, expected probabilities of default.
We obtain estimates of default probabilities from the Risk Management Institute (RMI)
of the National University of Singapore. RMI generates forward-looking default probabilities
for issuers on a daily basis for maturities of 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months ahead using the
reduced form forward intensity model of Duan, Sun, and Wang (2012). These measures have
been shown to work well in forecasting applications and are available for a very wide array of
firms (over 70,000 publicly listed firms worldwide).19 We next compute the first difference
of the default probability over our the May–Feb 2020 period and aggregate these default
probabilities at the industry level (4-digit NAICS) by averaging across firms (weighted by
18

See, e.g., Landier and Thesmar (2020) and Barrero et al. (2020) for related evidence on projected
aggregate declines.

For example, Gallagher, Schmidt, Timmermann, and Wermers (2020) use these probability estimates to
study changes in portfolio risk of international portfolios of securities owned by US money market funds, and
illustrate that the default probabilities closely track CDS spreads. For additional details on the database, see
https://rmicri.org/en/.

17

employment).
We estimate the following specification,
Default ProbabilityτI = aτ + βτ Covid-19 Work ExposureI + ετi .

(9)

The outcome variable is the industry-level probability of default over the next τ months. As
before, we restrict the sample to non-critical industries and weigh observations by the number
of employees in each industry.
Table 5 and Figure 8 present the results. Examining Table 5, we see that differences in our
Covid-19 work exposure measure are associated with increased probabilities of default. This
correlation is both statistically and economically significant and is monotonically increasing
in the forecast horizon τ . For instance, a one-standard deviation increase in our measure is
associated with a 0.22 percentage point increase in the probability of default over the next 6
months and a 0.44 percentage point increase over the next 2 years. Given that the average
probability of default over these horizons is 0.26 percent and 1.38 percent, respectively, these
magnitudes are quite substantial. Consistent with earlier evidence, we also observe that these
increases in default risk is considerably higher for non-critical industries relative to critical
industries.

2.4

Stock Market Performance

So far, we have seen that differences in our Covid-19 work exposure measure are correlated
with differences in analyst forecasts of revenue growth and default probabilities. Though
forward looking, both of these measures are somewhat subjective and may not necessarily
reflect the ‘average’ beliefs in the economy. Our next outcome variable partly addresses this
concern, as it focuses on differences in stock market valuations across industries.
We use data on stock returns from the Compustat Daily update database to holding
period returns over various horizons. We restrict attention to common stocks of firms that
have headquarters in the United States; are traded on NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ; and
eliminate financial and real estate firms (NAICS codes 52 and 53).20 Almost all of the
industries performed negatively during this period—the cross-sectional average decline is
equal to approximately 26 percent. Yet, there is considerable cross-industry dispersion—
20

We also exclude firms in the education sectors (6111–6114), because the remote exposures of employees
of the listed firms employed in these sectors are likely to be quite different from those employed in the
non-profit/government enterprises which comprise the vast majority of employment in these sectors. Likewise,
we exclude fast food restaurants (NAICS 722513) from the sample, as their exposures are likely to be quite
different from other firms in the restaurant industry.

18

the cross-sectional standard deviation is approximately equal to 18 percent. A select few
industries experienced price appreciation: firms in the grocery store industry (NAICS 4451)
saw a 21 percent increase in stock market values; firms in electronic shopping (NAICS 4541)
appreciated by approximately 13 percent. Others such as airlines (NAICS 4811) experienced
stock market declines of more than 65 percent.
Figure 9 illustrates our main results graphically via a scatter plot of our exposure measure
versus the stock market performance of these industries. Essential industries are marked in
red, while the trend line is estimated in the sample of non-essential industries. We note some
significant outliers that do not fit the line. For example, NAICS code 5414 corresponds to
interior designers; these workers can work remotely in normal times, but likely face significant
impairments to implementing these designs in the current environment.
We relate differences in our work exposure measure to differences in cumulative stock
market performance using the following specification,
Stock Returnsi = a + β Covid-19 Work Exposurei + εi

(10)

The dependent variable corresponds to cumulative stock returns from February 14th through
May 15, 2020. As before, we restrict the sample to non-critical industries. To ensure that our
results are not driven by small industries with high idiosyncratic volatility, we estimate (10)
using weighted least squares—where we weigh observations by the total number of employees
(across firms in our Compustat sample) in each industry. Weighting by the number of firms
in each industry leads to quantitatively similar findings. Standard errors are robust to
heteroskedasticity (White, 1980).
Column (1) of Table 4 present our estimates. Examining the table, we see that our
industry exposure measure is economically and statistically significant in accounting for
differences in the economic performance across industries. The magnitudes are considerable:
a one-standard deviation increase in the lockdown measure is associated with a 6.8 percent
decline in stock prices during this period. Given that the cross-sectional standard deviation
in industries’ stock market performance during this period is approximately 16.6 percent, our
measure captures a significant share of the overall dispersion. Figures 4 and 9 provide scatter
plots for non-critical industries aggregated by major sector and across all 4-digit industries,
respectively. In Panel B, we also note that stock market declines are considerably larger
(26%) in non-critical industries relative to critical ones (8%).
In sum, we find that a measure of disruption exposure constructed with pre-2019 data
is a statistically significant predictor of cross-industry heterogeneity in returns during the

19

Covid-19 pandemic. That said, however, these estimates are somewhat at odds with the
impact on stock returns we discuss above. Specifically, as we compare Columns (1) through
(8) of Table 4, we see that a one-standard deviation increase is associated with 6.7 percent
decline in stock prices, whereas the expected decline in revenues over 2020 and beyond is
much smaller and short-lived. In reconciling these differences, a few possibilities emerge.
First, firms profits may be substantially more affected than revenues; second, the differential
stock return performance could also driven by differential increases in systematic risk during
this period. After all, the January to May period of 2020 is a period of increased uncertainty
(see e.g., Baker, Bloom, Davis, and Terry, 2020).

3

Real-time estimates of the supply-side disruption

In our analysis so far, we have developed a measure of industry exposure to production
disruptions due to Covid and shown that heterogeneity in risk exposures is associated with
cross-industry differences in economic performance during the pandemic period. Our analysis
was essentially cross-sectional in nature as we focused on cumulative outcomes during the
entirety of the pandemic period. However, our measure can also be used to construct a
real-time indicator of news associated with these production disruptions. To do so, we exploit
the high-frequency information in data from the financial markets.
In particular, we re-estimate equation (10) for the subsample of non-critical industries,
while allowing the slope coefficient to vary over time,
Stock Returnsi,t = a + βt Covid-19 Work Exposurei + εi,t .

(11)

The realized time-series of the slope estimates βt have a portfolio return interpretation.
That is, they are a noisy (to the extent that our firm-level exposures are mis-measured)
estimate of the ‘Covid-19 return factor’, that is, the source of common variation in returns
that is related to the production disruptions as a result of the pandemic. (see, e.g. Fama
and MacBeth, 1973; Cochrane, 2009, for more details). Intuitively, this factor is a long-short
portfolio of industries based on their disruption exposure: it loads positively on industries in
which a lower fraction of workers report that they can telecommute, while loading negatively
on industries in which a higher fraction of workers report that they can work remotely.
Specifically, the return on the Covid-19 factor can be expressed as
β̂t =

where Xi is our (predetermined) measure of exposure for firm i, so the portfolio holds long
positions in stocks with exposure above the employment-weighted average exposure and short
positions otherwise.
Figure 11 summarizes how these portfolio weights vary across different broad sectors
(2-digit NAICS codes). The portfolio overweights industries whose workers can perform their
tasks from home, and underweight sectors where workers cannot work remotely. Consistent
with the discussion so far, we see that firms in retail trade, and accomodation and food
services receive large positive weights; by contrast firms in professional services and information
technologies receive negative weights. Appendix Table A.2 contains the full list of weights on
NAICS 4-digit industries.
Figure 10 plots these factor realizations in blue, along with returns on the market portfolio
in red. First, we note that the correlation between our factor and the market portfolio in
the three months before the pandemic period is significantly negative (approximately -0.4),
which suggests that the industries most exposed to the covid pandemic are industries with
low systematic risk during normal times. However, given the dominance of covid-related
news during this period, the correlation with the market during the pandemic period is
positive, though modest (it ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 depending on how the factor is constructed).
Further, we see in Figure 10 that extreme daily realizations of our factor are associated with
significant news about the pandemic.
In brief, we see that realizations of our ‘Covid-19 factor’ largely tracks the unfolding of
news related to the pandemic. As of May 15 2020, this long-short portfolio had lost roughly
50 percent of its value since the beginning of the year—compared to 10 percent for the broad
market index. This pattern supports the view that Covid-19 is primarily a reallocation shock
as not all sectors were symmetrically affected—which also echoes the views in Barrero et al.
(2020). These results speak to how investors could construct an investment strategy that
could significantly hedge future covid-19 related uncertainty. They could do so by taking a
short position in our Covid-19 factor, which would involve taking the opposite position to
the one described in Appendix Table A.2 .
Last, we also examine the real-time response of our two other forward-looking variables—
21

revisions in analyst forecasts and estimated default probabilities. Figures 12 and 13 summarize
our findings. Similar to our stock return evidence above, we see an increased divergence
in revenue forecasts and expected default probabilities across high- and low-Covid 19 work
exposure industries by the end of March and beginning of April 2020. Comparing the two
figures, we see that default probabilities appear to respond a bit earlier than analyst revenue
forecasts, and they seem to recover somewhat from their peaks by the end of April. That
said, these differences could simply be due to the fact that analyst forecasts are released with
some delay.

Conclusion

We characterize the supply-side disruptions associated with Covid-19 exploiting differences in
the ability of workers across industries to work remotely. Our results uncover economically
sizeable differences in economic outcomes for both workers and firms depending on the
ability to work remotely. Sectors in which a higher fraction of the workforce is not able to
work remotely experienced significantly greater declines in employment; significantly more
reductions in expected revenue growth; worse stock market performance; and higher expected
likelihood of default. Lower-paid workers, especially female workers with young children,
were significantly more affected by these disruptions.

Total Worker Foot Traffic in week t in Industry I
average change in weekly worker foot traffic—log Pre-period
.
Average Worker Foot Traffic of Industry I
Panel B plots the estimated βt coefficients from equation (2) in the main document, which
capture the differences in weekly foot traffic (relative to pre-period averages) between critical
and non-critical industries. Panels C and D report δt coefficients from cross-sectional
regressions of industry-level changes in worker foot traffic on our Covid-19 Work Exposure
(equation (3)) measure for critical and non-critical industries, respectively. All regressions are
weighted by total NAICS4 employment, and pre-period averages are computed from January
6-February 16 of 2020. Dates on the horizontal axis correspond with the end of each calendar
week.

Covid−19 Work Exposure

Panel A plots employment growth rates from April 2020 vs 2019 from the BLS against
exposure (aggregated across 3-digit industries using BLS total employment weights). Panels
B-F plot stock returns (panel A) and revisions in revenue forecasts (panels B-E) for non-critical
industries from mid-February to mid-May versus the Covid-19 work exposure measure. For
purposes of generating the graph, we average across 4-digit non-critical industries, weighting
by Compustat employment.

The top panel of this figure plots the revisions in revenue forecasts for Q2 2020 between
mid-February and mid-May 2020 versus the Covid-19 work exposure measure. The bottom
panel plots the corresponding revisions for the year 2020. The points in red correspond to
the critical industries listed in Appendix Table A.1.

The Figure plots the estimated coefficients from equation (8) in the main document. Specifically, we plot the relation between
revisions in industry-level revenue forecasts (from mid-February to mid-May 2020) as a function of their Covid-19 work exposure in
the sub-sample of non-critical industries. The plotted coefficients correspond to columns (2)-(4) and (6)-(7) of Panel B of Table 4.
Coefficients are standardized to a unit standard deviation change in the Covid-19 work exposure measure. Shaded areas correspond
to 95% confidence intervals.

COVID19 Factor

Market Portfolio

The figure shows the time-series of the estimated slope coefficients in equation (11) in blue. As noted by Fama and MacBeth (1973)
the realizations of these slope coefficients have a portfolio interpretation, here labeled as the ‘Covid-19 return factor’. These implied
portfolio returns are accumulated since beginning of the year. The red line represents cumulative returns to the market portfolio
during this period. Events are dated as if they occurred at the beginning of the trading day on the date of their announcement.

Figure plots the Fama-McBeth slope coefficients of a regression of default probabilities on
the (non-critical) industry’s Covid-19 work exposure at a daily frequency. The dependent
variable is expressed in percentage points so that the slope coefficient can be interpreted as
the increase, in basis points, of the probability of default associated with a 1 percentage point
increase in exposure. Regressions are weighted by employment. Different colors correspond
to different forecast horizons.

Table reports median characteristics of firms in the Compustat database, grouped into
quartiles based on our industry-based measure of Covid-19 work exposure. The left panel (A)
summarizes these characteristics for all firms, including those in critical industries. The right
panel (B) repeats the analysis for the subsample of firms which we classify as non-critical.
The list of critical industries at the 4-digit NAICS level is in Appendix Table A.1. Gross
profitability is sales (Compustat: sale) minus costs of goods sold (Compustat: cogs); Tobin’s
Q is computed as the sum of the book value of assets (Compustat: at) plus the market value
of equity (Compustat: prcc f times csho) minus the book value of equity (Compustat: ceq)
minus deferred taxes (Compustat: txdb). PPE is Property Plant and Equipment (Compustat:
ppegt).

Panels A and B of table reports the coefficients estimates from equation (4) in the document
using employment-weighted and unweighted specifications (t-statistics in parantheses). Oddnumbered columns repeat the analysis for the subsample of non-critical industries. The
dependent variable is expressed in percentage points and constructed using private sector
employment data from the BLS’ April 2020 employment report at the 3-digit NAICS level.
Standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity (White, 1980). The list of critical industries
at the 4-digit NAICS level is in Appendix Table A.1. We classify a 3-digit NAICS industry
as critical if at least 50% of its employment is classified as critical based on our more
disaggregated measure. Panel C reports the average declines in the dependent variable for
critical and non-critical industries, respectively, as well as the difference between the two
averages. The cross-sectional standard deviation across BLS industries is 12.5%.

Table reports the coefficients estimates from equation (5) in the document. Standard errors
are double-clustered based on occupation and industry (t-statistics in parantheses). The
dependent variable is an indicator which equals one if an individual does not have a job in
April (columns 1-3) or February (column 4) 2020. To be included in the sample, workers
need to appear in the March 2020 CPS and March 2019 ASEC survey, and either the April
and/or February core CPS sample. The list of critical industries at the 4 digit NAICS level is
in Appendix Table A.1. We define critical Census industries as those for which at least 50%
of employment is associated with critical NAICS industries. The cross-sectional standard
deviation of the exposure measure for workers in our sample is 12.4%.

Table, panel A, plots the coefficients estimates from equations (10) and (8) in the document
for non-critical industries, where the dependent variables are constructed using firm data
from Compustat and Capital IQ, aggregated to the 4-digit NAICS level. The regression is
weighted by total Compustat 2019 employment in each industry. Standard errors are robust
to heteroskedasticity (White, 1980). Panel B reports averages of each outcome for critical and
non-critical industries, as well as differences between the two. The list of critical industries is
in Appendix Table A.1. The cross-sectional standard deviation of exposure across critical
industries is 17.4%

industries, where the dependent variables are constructed using firm data from Compustat
and the RMI Credit Research Database, aggregated to the 4-digit NAICS level (t-statistics
in parantheses). The dependent variable is expressed in percentage points so that the slope
coefficient can be interpreted as the increase, in basis points, of the probability of default
associated with a 1 percentage point increase in exposure. The regression is weighted by total
Compustat 2019 employment in each industry. Standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity
