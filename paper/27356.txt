ABSTRACT
This paper evaluates the causal impacts of an early childhood home visiting program for which
treatment is randomly assigned. We estimate multivariate latent skill profiles for individual
children and compare treatments and controls. We identify average treatment effects of skills on
performance in a variety of tasks. The program substantially improves child language and
cognitive, fine motor, and social-emotional skills development. Impacts are especially strong in
the most disadvantaged communities. We go beyond reporting treatment effects as unweighted
sums of item scores. Instead, we examine how the program affects the latent skills generating
item scores and how the program affects the mapping between skills and item scores. We find
that enhancements in latent skills explain at least 90% of conventional unweighted treatment
effects on language and cognitive tasks. The program enhances some components of the function
mapping latent skills into item scores. This can be interpreted as a measure of enhanced
productivity in using given bundles of skills to perform tasks. This source explains at most 10%
of the average estimated treatment effects.

Introduction
A growing body of research establishes the effectiveness of home visiting programs

targeted to the early years in developing the skills of disadvantaged children. Home visiting programs have previously been shown to be effective (see, e.g., Grantham-McGregor
and Smith, 2016) and are relatively low cost compared to other early childhood programs.
They place minimal demands on the training required of the visitors and on the infrastructure required to support them. The Jamaica Reach Up and Learn program, established
some 30 years ago, is a successful prototype of a home visiting program emulated around
the world.
This paper studies a close replica of the original Jamaica Reach Up and Learn program,
China REACH, which was brought to scale in a poor region of Western China (1500+
participants compared to the 100-plus participants in the original Jamaica study). The
program is evaluated by a randomized control trial, as was the original Jamaica program.
Our evidence suggests that the program can be successfully implemented at scale.
The China REACH program has a strong impact on language and cognitive skills,
fine motor skills, and social-emotional skills. Impacts are especially strong in the most
disadvantaged communities.
We adjust for task difficulty across the multiple items used to assess skills and thus
avoid the unjustified approach widely followed in the literature of reporting unweighted
counts of performances on tasks, which vary in difficulty. We decompose conventional
treatment effects into induced improvements in latent skills and improvements in the
technology mapping skills into performance on tasks. Treatment effects mainly arise from
boosts in skills. At least 90% of the estimated treatment effects are due to changes in latent
inputs with the rest attributable to improvements in technologies.
This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the program and places it in context as a scaled version of an influential pilot program. Section 3 presents an array of
experimental treatment effects. We document heterogeneity in impacts. Section 4 exam2

ines the sources of the estimated treatment effects. Following Heckman et al. (2013), we
examine whether the program affects the inputs in the functions mapping skills to performance on tasks and whether it shifts the productivity of the map of latent skills to item
responses. Section 5 summarizes our findings. Supporting material is reported in a web
appendix: http://cehd.uchicago.edu/china-reach_home-visiting_appendix.

China REACH
The ongoing Rural Education and Child Health (China REACH) project was initially

launched in 2015 in response to a growing focus on, and call for, evidence-based pilot-topolicy analyses by China’s State Council. China REACH is a large scale program evaluated by a randomized control trial (RCT) designed to evaluate the impact of a home visit
delivery model for disadvantaged families. It is based on the successful Jamaican pilot
(e.g., Grantham-McGregor and Smith, 2016; Gertler et al., 2014). The program aims to
improve the health and cognition of children by enhancing their engagement with caregivers and the larger community.
The program was conducted in Huachi County in Gansu Province, which is one of
the poorest areas in China. The county has 15 townships, including 111 administrative
villages. 85 percent of the county is mountainous. The population is 132,000 people, of
whom 114,600 have rural hukou.1 The version of the program we study was started in
January 2015, and home visits started in September 2015. For details of program implementation, see Appendix A.
1 Hukou

is a type of household registration system in China that defines and limits mobility within
China. There are agricultural and non-agricultural types of hukou.

The program trained home visitors who have educational attainments at the level of
the mothers visited. In rural China, it is easily replicated because the potential supply of
home visitors is so large. The program encourages child caregivers to interact with their
children in developmentally appropriate ways. Heckman and Zhou (2020) document the
home visiting protocols used.
Local implementation of the China REACH project is conducted by a county project
coordinator, assisted by 24 township supervisors and 91 home visitors.2 The coordinator
prepares countywide training to oversee the township supervisors. The county project
coordinator and township supervisors randomly attend home visits for spot checks to
observe and review the work of the home visitors.
The supervisors support and manage home visitors. They make sure that the home
visitors prepare for weekly visits, review the content of past visits, plan activities for fu2 Townships

8 households’ home visits.

ture visits, and organize weekly meetings with the home visitors to improve and reflect on
the home visiting program and experience. Township supervisors visit each household
with the home visitor once a month and record monthly observations of the caregiver, the
child, and home visitor.
The visitors engage with households weekly and provide one hour parenting or caregiving guidance and support based on the Jamaica program protocols.3 In each home
visit, the home visitor records information about parental engagement (e.g., who worked
with the child during the visit, whether the home visitor taught parents relevant tasks if
the child could not participate in the home visit, who played with the child after the visit
and with what frequency), and child performance (e.g., the tasks taught in the last week,
and new tasks in the current week). Heckman and Zhou (2020) document the content
of China REACH curriculum. The curriculum includes more than 200 tasks related to
language and cognitive skill development and has about 20 tasks targeting gross motor
skills development.

2.1.1

Design of the Randomized Control Trial

The randomized control trial we study is based on a village (cluster) level matchedpair design. Bai (2019) shows that this design is optimal for minimizing the mean-squared
error of estimates of treatment effects. Implementation is in three steps. First, we examine
the entire universe of eligible villages in Huachi county.4 Second, based on both house3 The protocols are based on those used by the Jamaica program, adapted to Chinese culture (e.g., changing songs into popular Chinese songs, adding the background of pictures, which are familiar to Chinese
people). The protocol for children younger than 18 months old focuses on motor and language skill training. After 18 months old, the protocol adds more cognitive skill content (e.g., classification, pairing, and
picture puzzles).
4 The pre-treatment village-level covariates used for the matching village pairs include the: (1) “closeness
with children” scores on the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Inventory (HOME
IT) scale; (2) language skill scores on the HOME IT scale; (3) learning materials score on the HOME IT
scale; (4) take-up rate of a nutrition supplement program in the village; (5) compliance rate for a countywide nutrition program in the village; (6) percentage of left-behind children in the children sample; (7) per
capita net income in the village; (8) average years of schooling in the village; (9) the percentage of caregivers
intending to participate in the parenting intervention program; and (10) the percentage of families intending
to bring the child when migrating to urban areas.

hold surveys and village-level administrative data, the similarities of villages are assessed
using a Mahalanobis metric of resident and village characteristics. To minimize the Mahalanobis metric in each pair, we sort the villages with closest metric into pairs using the
nonparametric belief propagation (nbp) matching method.5
After matching village pairs, we randomly select one within the pair into the treatment group and the other village into the control group.6 Figure A2 in the Appendix
indicates the location of the paired villages in Huachi county. The design closely matches
the characteristics of the villages in the pairs.7

Estimated Treatment Effects
The China REACH intervention aims to promote multiple skills (e.g., motor, language,

cognitive, and social-emotional skills). Table 1 displays our measures of skill. The Denver
II test provides the detailed child development assessment task measures.8,9 The Bayley
III test converts composite scores into scaled scores based on age, which are more useful
in clinical practice. However, using itemized Denver II test measures, it is also possible to
achieve the same goal.10

et al. (2011)
total, there are 55 matched pairs, which means in both the treatment and control groups, there are 55
villages.
7 Appendix B documents baseline comparisons.
8 The Denver II test is designed for clinicians, teachers, or early childhood professionals monitoring
the development of infants and preschool age children. The test is primarily based on the examiner’s
actual observation rather than a parental report. It is an inventory of 125 tasks including four aspects
of skill measures: personal-social (getting along with people and caring for personal needs), fine motoradaptive (eye hand coordination, manipulation of small objects, and problem solving), language (hearing,
understanding, and using language), and gross motor (sitting, walking, jumping, and overall large muscle
movement). See Appendix B for more details on the test.
9 Appendix C gives both the English version and Chinese version Denver II Test measure tables.
10 The Bayley III test targets infants and children between 1-42 months old and includes the examiner’s observation (cognitive, motor, and language skills) and parent questionnaires (social-emotional and adaptive
behavior skills). Ryu and Sim (2019) report that the Denver test is better than the Bayley test in examining
the delay of language development.

This section reports conventional estimates of the home visiting intervention average
treatment effects over unweighted sums of item scores within each category. Item scores
are binary indicators of performance on a task. We use robust statistical methods to adjust
for missing data and allow disturbances within villages to be correlated, analyzing treatment effects on the proportion of items passed in the Denver test by each skill category at
both the county and village level (Cameron et al., 2008).
There is, however, a major drawback to evaluating average treatment effects using the
proportion of items correctly answered, although it is standard practice in the child development literature to do so. It assumes that the test difficulty levels are the same for each
task. In practice, there is substantial variation in the task difficulty levels in the Denver II
test we use. We address this problem using a nonlinear measurement model and recover
individual latent skills that generate item responses. We identify experimentally-induced
improvements in latent skills and also improvements in utilization of skills to perform
item specific tasks.

County level Average Treatment Effects

We first report average treatment effects for simple aggregates of correct answers estimated from the following specification:

Yiv = β 0 + Div β 1 + Zi0 β 2 +

P

∑ 1{i ∈ p} β p + ε iv

p =1

where Yiv is outcome j for child i in village v, Div is a dummy variable indicating the
treatment status of village v in which child i lives, and Zi are the pre-treatment covariates.
1{i ∈ p} is an indicator of whether the child i lives in the village pair p. Define the full
j

array of right hand side variables in (1) as Xiv . Let Yiv (d) denote the vector of outcomes
fixing treatment status d. The treatment assignment design implies that
j

j

(Yiv (0), Yiv (1)) ⊥⊥ Div | Zi .

(2)

Bai et al. (2019) show that under model specification (1), idiosyncratic shocks ε iv are
independent at the individual level. Using their method, we can consistently estimate the
average treatment effect. They also derive the asymptotic distribution of the estimated
j

β1.
As treatment is at the village level, we allow the idiosyncratic shock term ε iv for child i
to be arbitrarily correlated with ε i0 v for any other child i0 6= i in the same village v, but the

idiosyncratic shocks are assumed to be independent across villages ε iv ⊥⊥ ε kv0 for ∀i ∈ v
and ∀k ∈ v0 , v 6= v0 . Residual plots in Appendix E verify the assumption of independence

villages is block diagonal: Ωvv0 = 0; all v 6= v0 .11

et al. (2008) discuss this problem and suggest that the wild cluster bootstrap has good performance for making cluster-robust inference. Details of the wild bootstrap procedures
we use are presented in Appendix F.13
In our sample, over 98% of eligible children in the treated villages receive home visits.
Still, about 15% of children from both the control and treatment groups miss the annual
child development assessment. To obtain consistent estimates of average treatment effects, we use an inverse probability weighting method (Tsiatis, 2006).14,15
Table 2 presents the treatment effects for each skill category using standardized outcome measures.16,17 Columns (1), (2), and (4) use all available data samples, and columns
(3) and (5) only use samples of children who are younger than 2 years old at the time in
September of 2015 when the program started. The treated younger children have at least
one year exposure to the intervention.18
The first row in Table 2 shows that the children in the treatment group are, on average,
more likely to have higher language and cognitive skills.19 On average, treated children’s
scores are 0.7 standard deviation higher than those in the control group. In the first row,
12 ê

v are the OLS
13 Since we have

residuals.
55 clusters, recent concerns raised about the wild bootstrap do not apply. See Canay

et al. (2019).
14 Ma and Wang (2019) provide robust inference on the IPW method to trim out low probability observation. In our paper, only three observations’ propensity scores of not missing are less than 0.1. Therefore, we
do not need to trim the data and we can avoid the inconsistency problem.
15 Appendix D documents the details of the data attrition problem and how we construct the probability
of missing data. To avoid redundancy, we include inverse probabilities in all estimations in the paper.
16 Only 140 children took the Denver test at the baseline. We estimate the same model for the children
with the baseline information and do not find significant differences in the Denver test score between the
control and treatment groups. The details about this balancing test are presented in Appendix B.
17 There is no population level measure of the Denver Test in China. We use the control group children as
the reference group: we estimate the Denver test performance by monthly age and then use the mean and
the variance to standardize the test scores at each monthly age group for both the treatment and control
groups.
18 There are two reasons for restricting the sample: (1) As claimed, we want the children in the treatment
group to have enough exposure to the intervention; and (2) We have more older children in the control
group than in the treatment group because the field team did not update the name list in the treatment
group after September 2015.
19 We combine these categories to obtain a comparable number of item scores, as we have for the other
categories.

9

we see that at midline (about 9 months after the intervention) the language and cognitive
skills of the children in the treatment group are about 0.7 standard deviations higher than
the control’s. At the end of the intervention, treatment effects on language and cognitive
skills have effect sizes greater than 1.1. The intervention significantly improves the treated
children’s language and cognitive skills. The magnitude of the age-adjusted treatment
effects increases when the children in the treatment group have longer exposures to home
visitors (see columns (3) and (5)).
The intervention significantly improves social-emotional skills at midline, fine motor
skills at the end of the intervention, and produces no significant improvement in gross
motor skills. This finding is consistent with the design of the curriculum which focuses
more on language and cognitive skill development.20,21
Tables 3-4 display the county level treatment effects by gender. An interesting finding,
consistent with recurrent findings in literature (Elango et al., 2016), is that the intervention
improves boys’ language and cognitive skills much more than those of girls. At midline,
the treatment effect size for girls is 0.4, and 0.9 for boys, respectively. At the end of the
intervention, the effect size is about 0.9 for the girls and 1.1 for the boys. One reason
for this is a threshold effect: on average girls are relatively more developed than boys
at the same age in early childhood. The girls in the treatment group also have better
performance in terms of social-emotional skills.22

Figure 2 shows the distribution of village level treatments at midline ordered by magnitude.23 For language and cognitive standardized scores, there are 40 villages with positive treatment effects, eight of which have significantly positive treatment effects. 17
villages’ treatment effects have effect sizes greater than 1 standard deviation (relative to
otherwise similar but untreated children). Six villages’ treatment effects are greater than
2. In Appendix G, we adjust for cherry picking and show that the high-end outcomes are
unlikely to arise by chance.
For fine motor scores, 31 villages have positive treatment effects; eight are statistically
significant. In general, social-emotional treatment effects are not large: among 37 pairs
with positive treatment effects, most of the treatment effects are statistically insignificant
with only 2 pairs’ treatment effects greater than 2. The distribution of gross motor skill
village-level treatment effects are relatively symmetric: there were 25 pairs with positive
effects and 30 with negative effects.
The village-level estimated treatment effects are consistent with the county-level estimates: the improvement in language and cognitive skills contributes most to the Denver
test score treatment effects. For gross motor scores, the home visiting intervention has

little impact. Almost all estimated effects are statistically insignificant from zero.
Figure 3 gives the village level treatment effect distribution at the endline. (The identities of the village change across graphs which are ordered by magnitudes of treatment
outcomes.) Language score treatment effects contribute the most to total score treatment
effects: 41 pairs with positive treatment effects and seven of them are significant. The
treatment effects at endline are greater than the ones at midline: 20 pairs of treatment
effects are above 1, and seven pairs have effect sizes greater than 2. Treatment effects for
social-emotional and gross motor skills are statistically significant. Tables 5 (midline) and
6 (endline) give raw correlations across village pairs of treatment effects across skills. At
midline, the correlations are substantial: the language and gross motor skills correlate at
about 0.38, language and social-emotional correlate at 0.42, and all other correlations are
above 0.5. However, at the endline, only the two types of gross motor skills are highly
correlated at the village level.
In Table 7, we compare the top ten treated villages with the highest language and
cognitive treatment effects to those of the bottom ten treated villages. Before the home
visiting intervention, except for the proportion of females children, there are no significant differences between the high-performing and low-performing villages. However,
when we compare the measures evaluating home visit quality, we find that the qualities of interactions between the home visitor and caregiver/child are significantly better
in the high-performing villages than those in the low-performing villages. Also, in the
low-performing villages, the grandmother appears 1.6 times more often than in the highperforming villages. These effects of the quality of visitor interactions arise even though
the home environments, on average, are worse in the high-performing villages than the
low-performing villages before the intervention.

The Effect of Treatment on Latent Skills

The previous analysis shows that treatment boosts outcomes on unweighted item aggregates. Aggregates so formed, while traditional, are intrinsically uninterpretable, unless the difficulty is the same across tasks, which, is not true by design.
To address this issue, we take advantage of the multi-item nature of our data and
estimate a nonlinear factor model with individual level latent skills.24 We follow standard methods in psychometrics and introduce and estimate difficulty parameters across
items (van der Linden, 2016). We also estimate individual level latent skills. We use our
estimates to determine the impact of treatment on the skills that generate item scores.
We also estimate how much the intervention shifts the mapping between skills and item
scores (i.e., whether treated children better utilize their skills). Shifts in these mappings
can be due to improvements in children’s ability to utilize skills.

3.3.1

Model Specification

The outcomes we study are children’s performances on individual item tasks measured by performance above thresholds or correct answers on an item on a test. There
are NJ tasks. We break down the tasks by skill categories (motor, cognitive, etc.) when
we conduct our empirical analysis. Here we abstract from these categories to simplify
notation. Performance on the item tasks is assumed to be generated, in part, by latent
skills.
Let Y j∗ (d) denote a latent outcome for task j for a person with treatment status d ∈

{0, 1}. Let θdi be a k-dimensional vector of latent skills for person with treatment status d.
Xi is a vector of baseline covariates. We write the mapping from latent skills to outcome
j as
0

j∗

j

Yi (d) = Xi0 βd + δ j + (θdi ) α j,d + ε i
24 In

(5)

the data, for each individual, we have more than 70 items to measure his or her task performances
in the Denver test.

where α j,d is a vector of factor loadings, δ j is a task difficulty parameter and the coefficients βd , α j,d may depend on treatment as well as the latent skills.
This model conceptualizes the intervention as shaping a bundle of invariant skills
that are mapped into performance on tasks. An alternative interpretation is that the α j,d
parameters are enhancements of skill. The intervention α j,d so (θd )0 α j,d is a bundle of
effective skills from intervention D = d.
Using this model, under suitable normalizations we estimate the individual level latent skill factors θdi , and not just the distribution of the latent skill factors, as in traditional
j

models in psychology (see e.g., van der Linden, 2016). We assume that ε i is unit normal, independent of the other right hand-side variables. For this panel probit model with
latent skills, we estimate both the parameters of observed covariates, the latent factors,
and the effects of latent skill factors on outcomes. Fernández-Val and Weidner (2016)
show that the estimators are asymptotically unbiased when the number of observations
NI → ∞ and NJ → ∞ but

NI
NJ

converges to a constant. These conditions apply in our

sample with large numbers of tasks and observations.
0

0

Factor models require normalizations. Since θdi α j,d = (θdi ) AA−1 α j,d , the factors and
factor loadings are intrinsically arbitrary unless a scale is set. Using a normalization applied by Anderson and Rubin (1956), we identify both the vector θdi and α j,d . This issue is
moot if we only seek to estimate effective skills, (θdi )0 α j,d . We report estimates for θdi and
α j,d separately and then as a bundle of effective skills.
Following traditions in the Rasch model literature, we assume that δj is an invariant
task difficulty parameter intrinsic to the measurement system and independent of treatment status. This is one way to assure comparability of measurements across treatments
and controls.
21

We have four different latent skill factors in our model, corresponding to social-emotional,
language and cognitive, fine motor, and gross motor skills in the Denver II test. To interpret the factors, we assume that performance on K of NJ tasks (K ≤ NJ ) depends only
on one factor, what Cunha et al. (2010) call the “dedicated factor case", except we only
require that a subset of tasks are dedicated for any measurement of skills. We normalize
the factor loading matrix so the first K rows form an IK,K identity matrix. For the K = 4
normalized items, we assume that they load on one skill.25 After normalization, the factor
loading matrix for the vector of NJ outcome is:

We report sensitivity analyses with a variety of plausible normalizations in Appendix J
and find that the estimates of α reported in the text are stable under different normalizations.26 Our results are quantitatively robust. We use the estimation procedure proposed
by Chen et al. (2019) to estimate panel probit models with multiple latent skill factors.27
25 We

select the washing and drying hands item, the imitate vertical line item, the combine words item,
and the broad jump item to present social-emotional skills, fine motor skills, language and cognitive skills,
and gross motor skills, respectively. Washing and drying hands is an important social skill in China due to
its emphasis on hygiene and safe social environments.
26 In Appendix J (page 44), we compare the distribution of the skill loadings under different normalizations. We find that the results are robust when we choose the items within the median range difficulty
level.
27 Details regarding the method are presented in Appendix H.

22

3.3.2

Estimates

Table 8 presents estimates of βd . There are no statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups, although the point estimates for males are substantially more negative for the treatment group. In Figure 4, we compare the distribution
of language and cognitive task items between our model estimates and the data. We fit
the data well and as we do the other types of tasks.28
Figure 5 shows the array of difficulty level parameters δ j for each task item. When the
item difficulty level increases, the estimates become smaller. The difficulty level parameters δj provide information about whether the test is well designed. For example, the
test for gross motor skills is not very well designed: values of the difficulty level are flat
around -1.8 and then quickly jump to -6 by the fifth item. This means that the children
who took the test could correctly answer easy items but failed to answer all hard questions. Compared to gross motor skills task items, language and cognitive task items are
better designed since the difficulty level rises smoothly across all items. The design of
social-emotional task items could also be improved.

factors, these are the means of the estimated skill distributions. We find that except for
gross motor skills, all other latent skill factors in the treatment group are significantly
higher than those in the control group. Also, language and cognitive skills are negatively
correlated with gross motor skills and positively correlated with social-emotional and
fine motor skills. When we compare treatment effects across different latent skills, we
find that improvements in fine motor and language skills are at the same level but that
there are no effects on gross motor skills.

2. p-values are with respect to the null of equality of treatment and control summary measures.

As evident from equation (5), at the same level of skill, the larger the factor loadings,
the better the child’s performance. Table 11 gives the summary statistics for the skill
loadings on different tasks. Except for gross motor skills, we reject equality of the summary statistics of treatment and control groups. In addition, the table shows the average
effectiveness of each type of skill for performance of various tasks. For example, the loadings of language and cognitive skills are very large for language and cognitive tasks, but
the loadings of social-emotional skills for the same tasks are relatively small. This means
that, given the same amount of increase in language and social-emotional skills, language
skills improve the language task performance more.

3.3.3

Distributions of Latent Skill

We first compare the language skill distributions of the control and treatment groups.
Figure 8 (a) shows that the density of language and cognitive skills for the treatment
group shift right; the treatment group shifts right and also has a fatter upper tail than the
one in the control group. Figure 8 (b) shows that at almost every point of the cumulative distribution, language and cognitive skills are larger in the treated group than in the
control group.

Figure 10: Fine Motor Skills Distribution and Stochastic Dominance Curves

Regarding gross motor skills, we find that the factor distributions are similar between
the control and the treatment groups. Figures 11 (a) and (b) show that both the densities
and CDFs of the two gross motor skills distributions are close.
There are two main findings reported in this section. First, language and cognitive,
social-emotional, and fine motor skills were substantially improved by the program. Notice that looking solely at mean treatment effects, we only find significant improvement
in language and cognitive skills and not strong effects on fine motor and social-emotional
skills by the end of the intervention. The reason is that mean treatment effects show the
combination effects of latent skills and the impact of the skill loadings. However, as we
show below, the latter plays a minor role.
Second, gross motor distributions are not significantly different between the control
and the treatment groups, which is also consistent with the mean treatment effect estimates. We next explore the sources of these treatment effects.

Decomposing ATE
We use our estimates of latent skill profiles to understand the sources of the experi-

mental ATEs. We compare experimental treatment effects with those obtained from our
model.

4.1

The Source of Treatment Effects

Average treatment effects produced from the experiment can arise from changes in
the mapping from skills to task performance or from changes in skills. We investigate the
quantitative importance of each of these sources.
For each Denver test item j, the outcome measured is as follows:
j∗

0

j

yi = Xi ( Di β j,1 + (1 − Di ) β j,0 ) + Di ((θ1i )0 γ j,1 ) + (1 − Di )((θ0i )0 γ j,0 ) + ε i

(7)

j∗

where, yi is latent task measure j in the Denver test, θdi is child i’s latent skill vector, and
γ j,d is the latent skill loading vector. Di is the indicator of treatment status. We assume

We define λ̃ as the mean difference in the latent skills produced by the intervention:

λ̃ := E(

∑

(θ1i )0 γ j,1 | xi , Di = 1) − E(

j∈{1,...,NJ }

∑

(θ0i )0 γ j,0 | xi , Di = 0)

(9)

j∈{1,...,NJ }

We ignore X because we cannot reject the hypothesis that β j,1 = β j,0 . Since we recover
the individual latent skills θdi , equation (9) provides another way to evaluate the average
treatment effects on Denver test scores. We compare the treatment effects obtained from
the experiment with the estimates based on our model of latent skills in Table 12.
The point estimates of the average treatment effects are almost identical using these
two methods. From the column of p-values, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the two
estimates are the same.

Decomposing Treatment Effects

Experimental treatment effects may not only arise from enhancements of latent skills
but also from changes in the mapping from skills to tasks. In order to understand the
source home visiting intervention treatment effects, in this section, we decompose the
item-level treatment effects into two components: the effects from the changes in the
mapping from skills to treatment effects, and the effects of treatment on skill factors.
j

For each item j, the outcome Yi is:
j,d

Yi

j

= 1( Xi0 β j,d + δ j + (θdi )0 α j,d + ε i > 0)

(10)

j

where we assume ε i ∼ N (0, 1). From Equation (10), we see that the home visiting
treatment effects come from three channels: changes in the observable coefficient, β j,d ,
changes in skill factors (θdi ) and changes in factor loadings for skills. Define F1 (θ1 , X )
and F0 (θ0 , X ) as the distribution of (θ1 , X ) and (θ0 , X ) in the treatment and control populations, respectively. The population treatment effect for item j can be decomposed as
follows:
Pr(Y j,1 = 1) − Pr(Y j,0 = 1)

=

{Φ([ x0 β j,1 + δ j + (θ1 )0 α j,1 ]) − Φ([ x0 β j,0 + δ j + (θ1 )0 α j,1 ])}dF1 (θ1 , X )

From Latent Skill Factors

Notice that equation (11) holds when there is common support for X and the factors
in the control and treatment groups have similar distributions of observable covariates,
which is essentially satisfied in our sample.31 Table 13 reports the decomposition of treatment effects.32 The main drivers of treatment effects are increases in latent skills. The
31 To

have a comparable sample between the control and treatment groups in our data, we restrict our
sample to the children who are older than 12 months and younger than 46 months.
32 We set β j,0 = β j,1 since it is consistent with the evidence.

Table 14 shows that for comparable outcome measures at the early ages, China REACH
is on track with Jamaica Reach Up and Learn, which has been shown to generate sub33

stantial lifetime benefits (see Grantham-McGregor and Smith, 2016; Gertler et al., 2014).
Treatment effects are comparable and we cannot reject the hypothesis that the treatment
effects are the same across these two interventions.

Conclusion
This paper estimates the treatment effects from a large scale early childhood home vis-

iting intervention program (China REACH) on child skill development, patterned after
the successful and widely-emulated Jamaica Reach Up and Learn program. Since national policy in China is driven by evidence, rigorous analysis of China REACH has the
potential to have a large effect on policy discussions.
We estimate child latent skills and provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms generating the standard treatment effects on child skill development that adjust
for difficulty of the various tasks used to assess the program. The program significantly
improves child language, fine motor, and social-emotional skills. Impacts are largest in
the most disadvantaged communities, as measured by home environments. Latent skill
improvements explain about 90% of the treatment effects on language and cognitive skill
development. The program also shifts the technology mapping latent skills into treatment
effects although this source explains less than 10% of the estimated treatment effects on
average and is mostly concentrated on language skills. The latter source is quantitatively
small and not precisely determined, although the program shifts aggregate measures of
the mappings from skills to tasks. Effects of the program appear to arise primarily from
beneficial interaction patterns between home visitors and caregivers and home visitors
and children, a point we develop further in a companion paper (Heckman and Zhou,
2020). Our analysis offers a prototype for measuring latent skills from diverse outcome
measures and adjusting for the difficulty inherent in tasks.
