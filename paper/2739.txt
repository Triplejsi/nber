Introduction

Industrial policies have been

a major source

of economic and

political debate in the United States and other nations in recent
years.

Advocates of industrial policies assert that since all

public policies inevitably influence the composition

of output and

some industries are "better" for a national economy than others, it
is appropriate

for governments

to manage their influence on the

economy to promote goals like growth and competitiveness.
Industrial policy advocates often cite Japan as an example of a
nation that has benefitted from sound industrial policies.

Critics

of industrial policy have generally cited standard economic

arguments against such policies, suggesting that in competitive or
nearly competitive markets, there are no gains to be had from
altering the composition of output.
In tandem with political debates over industrial policy, a

burgeoning academic literature on strategic trade policy, initiated
by Brander and Spencer (1983,

1984)

and surveyed in Krugman

(1986),

has examined policy measures that can shift monopoly rents from one
nation to another when product markets are imperfectly competitive.
A central focus in this literature has been on imperfections

in

product markets, especially markets with large learning curve
effects.

While this literature has yielded intriguing

counterexamples

to some widely believed propositions,

we believe

that its emphasis on product market imperfections as the potential

2

rationale for industrial policies is somewhat misplaced.1
We suspect that deviations from competitive labor markets which
give rise to significant inter-industry wage differentials are at
least equally important for industrial policy as are product market
imperfections.

Industrial policy advocates like Robert Reich and

Lester Thurow, who encourage subsidies for "high value added
production",
industries,

appear to be referring not to especially profitable
but to industries that pay high wages.

international pervasiveness

The

of subsidies to steel industries

is

probably more easily understood on the basis of their high wage jobs
than on the basis of the profits earned by steel companies.
The observation

that rents accruing to labor are much more

significant than monopoly rents received by firms is a very general
one.

For the American non—financial corporate sector in 1987,

employee compensation represented

82 percent of value added while

operating profits represented only 18 percent, with the bulk of the
latter figure being the return to capital rather than monopoly
rents.

It follows that the labor rents associated with industry

wage differentials of even 10 percent bulk very large when compared
with plausible estimates of firms' monopoly rents.2
LA prominent exception to this criticism is Krugman (1984), who
emphasizes the potential importance of wage differentials caused by
unions.
2The presumption that labor rents are much greater than rents
received by firms does not necessarily mean that product market
imperfections are a minor source of rents. A large fraction of the
rents earned by workers may arise from the ability of both union and

We

begin in Section II by demonstrating that, contrary to competitive
labor market theories, there are substantial differences between

working under apparently similar conditions. The

space.

While unions are a partial source of these wage

very important.

The differentials appear to arise from the

importance of motivating,

Katz (1986) and from rent—sharing considerations.

We find that inter—industry wage differences provide a rationale for
policies quite similar to those that have been advanced by
industrial policy advocates.

While it is difficult to justify

relying on abnormally skilled workers or by using a great deal of

The pattern of these differentials

is remarkably parallel

suggests that workers in some sectors earn substantial

result from factors fundamental to the operation of

different types of workers.

This raises the question of what are the attributes of high- and

III.

Wace Differentials and Trade Policies

The basic argument linking labor market imperfections

and trade

policies has long been recognized by trade theorists (see for
example Bhagwati and Srinivasan

(1983) and Magee (1976)).

It has

been echoed, though in a less clear fashion, in the American debate
over industrial policies. If competitive

forces do not equalize

wages in different sectors and if firms operate on their labor
demand curves, then the marginal product of labor in different
sectors will not be equated, resulting in allocative inefficiencies.
Policies which raise employment in high wage sectors at the expense
of employment in low wage sectors will therefore increase allocative
efficiency.

This line of argument captures the thrust of industrial

policy arguments suggesting that countries can raise their workers'

19
standards of living by encouraging

the growth of "high value added

industries".

We begin by demonstrating that the interaction of trade
policies with wage differentials

has welfare consequences that are

likely to be more important to the profit shifting effects that have
been the focus of recent discussions of strategic trade policy.
Then we examine arguments against subsidies to employment in high
wage sectors based on rent seeking and equity considerations.

We

conclWde that on economic grounds there is a reasonably strong
welfare argument for measures that promote production in high wage
industries,

though any policy judgment must depend on an assessment

of how skillfully the government would manage its interventions.

Wage Differentials In A Closed Economy
For simplicity,

consider a stylized economy with two sectors.12

Following the terminology of Doeringer and Piore (1971), we label
these sectors secondary and primary.

As we discuss below, the

primary sector pays higher wages and offers workers more responsible
jobs than the secondary sector.

improvement.
So far we have maintained the assumption of perfect competition
in product markets and the assumption that the capital stock in each

industry is fixed.

Relaxing these assumptions tends to strengthen

the case for policies directed at expanding the primary sector.

If

firms in the primary sector have market power, this is another

reason apart from wage premia why the social marginal product of
labor in the primary sector exceeds the social marginal product of
labor in the secondary sector.

Put more directly: there is an

efficiency case for subsidizing the variable inputs of a monopolist.
Allowing for variable capital input strengthens the case for
subsidies to high-wage industries.

If wage differentials

do not

depend on the capital intensity of the primary sector, then the
appropriate policy instrument in the presence of noncompetitive wage
differentials

is a wage subsidy.

If wage differentials are an

increasing function of capital intensity as some rent—sharing
theories

would suggest, then there is a case for capital investment

subsidies to offset the "tax" levied by labor on capital
investments.

How substantial are the potential gains from public policies
directed at offsetting the effects of inter—industry wage
differentials?

One way of answering this question is by comparing

the efficiency costs of inter-industry wage differentials

with other

distortions that have received more attention from economists.

Section II showed that the standard deviation of nonunion industry
compensation differences

after correcting for measured ability

was about 18%.

About 15% of private sector American

workers are covered by trade union agreements, and it is generally
estimated that their compensation is about 20% above those of other
workers.

If this were the only source of wage inequality, the

standard deviation of wages would be approximately

suggests that substantial gains may be achievable by targeting
investment incentives towards high wage sectors.

This does not change the condition (1) or the

of employment subsidies for the primary sector.

Opening up the economy does however strengthen the case for large
subsidies.

In a closed economy, subsidies to the primary sector

encounter diminishing returns as its output declines in value with
increased production.

This does not happen when the price of output

is set on world markets and is insensitive to the level of domestic
production.

15

There is a further point to be made.

As Figure 5 illustrates,

the marginal welfare gained per dollar of subsidy will be greater

It is clear from the figure that the

It follows that at least small movenents towards protection

of activist trade policies typically stress the

potential defect that they invite retaliation, which offsets any
initial benefits. This argument does not apply when policy options
are limited to subsidies directed at capturing

rents.

In the model considered here, it is true that countries would prefer
that their subsidies to primary sector output not meet retaliation.
In our model, however, subsidies that are retaliated against by

similar subsidies are nonetheless likely to raise the welfare of
both countries.16

This is because they will drive the world economy

to a situation like subsidized first best optimum depicted in Figure
4.

Note further that subsidies beyond the point where the marginal

product of labor in the primary and secondary sectors are equated

A more

plausible formulation of

wait unemployment would recognize that incumbent employees typically
retain the rights to their jobs each period so that only new

subsidizing workers who are receiving relatively high wages.

The

argument is more subtle, however, than it at first appears.
Subsidies to the primary sector enlarge it, thereby raising the
probability

of secondary sector workers being able to move into the

primary sector.

Bulow and Summers (1986) demonstrate that small

subsidies to the primary sector are Pareto improvements relative to
laissez faire, in the special case where all workers are
homogenepus,

movements between sectors can be characterized by a

Markov process, and efficiency wage considerations lead to constant
lifetime utility differences

between workers in the two sectors.

More generally, efficiency enhancing subsidies will not produce
Pareto improvements, particularly

if there are some secondary sector

workers who have no chance of getting primary sector jobs because of
their lack of skill.

It is of course possible to argue that optimal

subsidies should be given to improve the allocation of output, and
then income redistribution
perverse distributional

measures should be used to offset any

consequences.20

On balance, the arguments in this section suggast that there is
a legitimate economic argument in support of policies directed at
encouraging production in high—wage sectors of the economy.

Even

though such measures are likely to increase wage differentials,

20The issue is a complex because policies that tax high wage
workers for the benefit of low wage workers will, at least in some
efficiency wage models, have perverse effects on the composition of
output by reducing the relative utility of primary sector workers.
Thus, income redistribution policies may undo the allocative effects
of subsidies to sectors with that pay wage premia.

Especially in nonunion

contexts, it appears unlikely that rent seeking losses will outweigh
the gains achievable through increasing high wage employment.

Wage Differentials and American Trade Policies
The belief that international competition is profoundly

changing the economic landscape and leading to the
deindustrialization

of America is often expressed in debates over

American industrial policy.

The crude argument that the United

States is losing its manufacturing base to international

competitors

is often put forward as a justification for policies directed at
limiting imports or spurring exports.

In George Meany's picturesque

phrase, "you cannot have a healthy economy based on everyone doing
everyone else's laundry".
The claim that the United States might lose its ability to
compete in all industries rests on confusion.

As long as foreigners

accumulate claims on American assets,

the United States must ultimately run a surplus.

The interesting

question for structural trade policy is therefore whether trade

a high

level of both exports and imports or with

alow

level of both exports and imports is preferable.
To shed light on this issue, Tables 4 and 5 presents
information

on the characteristics

of American manufacturing

industries, distinguishing between "import" and "export" industries.

We focus only on manufacturing because of data limitations regarding
other sectors, and because manufacturing

accounts for the lion's

The number of import or export workers in

each industry is estimated as the product of the industry's total

number of employees and the fraction of total industry shipments

by imports or exports.

Table 4 lists the manufacturing industries with the highest
import and export shares.

Most of the export industries

rely

heavily on high technology, aircraft being a prominent example.

The

import industries are more mixed, ranging from footwear to office
machines to motor vehicles.

Particularly in the case of export

industries, it is striking that durable and capital goods play an
important role in merchandise

trade.

Intraindustry trade is very important even at the three digit
level; the correlation between import and export shares was 0.06 in
1983.

The widely cited examples of automobiles and steel, where very high
wage industries face substantial import penetration and are almost
completely unable to export, appear to be atypical.

The general

pattern is that export intensive industries are the ones with
substantial

wage premia.

Reflecting patterns of American comparative advantage, export
intensive industries in the United States also employ more skilled

workers and do more research and development than import intensive
industries.

Export intensive industries devote 8.7 percent of sales

to research and development, compared to 1.1 percent for import
intensive industries.

industry has 14 years of schooling, compared with 12 years for the
average worker in import intensive industry.

Trends in American Trade
Discussions of American competitiveness have differed on

whether the changing trade patterns of recent years are simply the
consequence

of aberrant exchange rate movements brought about

macroeconomic

policies and speculative

forces, or are instead the

result of long term structural deterioration.

A

central issue in

36
the deindustrializationdebate is whether or not the United States
has suffered particularly

severe competitive

losses in "good

industries", variously defined as those that emphasize technology or
have high value added per worker.

The analysis in the preceding

section suggests that examining the relative performance

of high and

low wage industries probably provides the best way of getting at
this issue.

Assuming fixed ratios of employment to shipments, Table 7
indicates how changing trade patterns have affected employment in
high and low wage industries.

Between 1960 and 1980, the number of

jobs displaced by imports was approximately equal to the number of
jobs created by exports.

During the 1980s,

the fraction of workers employed in producing tradeable goods
declined as the trade deficit increased.

Between 1980 and 1984, the

last year for which we have data available, the increase in the
trade deficit was associated with a reduction of 1.4 million workers

Over 600,000 or 43% of these

workers worked in the quartile of industries that paid the lowest
wages.

Conclusion

The analysis in the preceding sections suggests that

in the labor market may have at least as much
as imperfections

in product markets for trade policies.

Labor market rents earned by workers in high—wage industries are

very large relative to plausible estimates of monopoly profits.
Unlike the case of product market imperfections where optimal
policies are not robust to small changes in assumptions about
corporate strategies, the theoretical case for policies which
promote high wage premium industries is reasonably robust.

observed worker skill measures, our theoretical arguments suggest
that export promoting policies are much more likely to promote
economic welfare than import competing policies.
There are of course a number of other considerations that must
be weighed before any policy judgments are made.

First, following

much of the literature, we have abstracted from the possibility

there is a strong case for encouraging the growth of externality

generating industries.

Second, if wages are very sensitive to the

rents earned by firms, it is possible that product market effects
are more important than we have suggested but show up as labor

market rents.

Fourth, we have ignored

political considerations that might lead activist policyTnakers to

decision to undertake industrial policy was taken.
Despite these limitations, we believe that our results

strengthen the economic case against import protecting policies and
for export promoting policies.
