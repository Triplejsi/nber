Portfolio Delegation and 401(k) Plan Participant Responses to COVID-19
David Blanchett, Michael S. Finke, and Jonathan Reuter
NBER Working Paper No. 27438
June 2020
JEL No. G11,G23,G41,G51,G53
ABSTRACT
We analyze the behavior of 401(k) plan participants during the first quarter of 2020, when
COVID-19 generated historic volatility, large negative returns, and significant unemployment.
Only 2.1% of participants invested in TDFs made any changes to their portfolios, with even lower
rates of change among those defaulted into robo-advised managed accounts, suggesting that
delegation can decrease the likelihood of portfolio mistakes by less sophisticated participants.
While 16.6% of non-delegated participants made portfolio changes, these changes were more
likely among more sophisticated participants and appear not to have reduced participants’
quarterly returns. Consistent with liquidity constraints, however, withdrawals spike following job
loss.

1. Introduction
A common investment mistake is the behavioral tendency to shift wealth from risky to safe assets
in volatile and declining markets (Ben-Rephael, Kandel, and Wohl, 2012; Friesen and Sapp, 2007). For
example, Bucher-Koenen and Ziegelmeyer (2014) document that German households with lower levels of
financial literacy were the most likely to sell equity at a loss during the global financial crisis of 2008 and
2009. The COVID-19 pandemic produced more extreme changes in U.S. stock prices over 22 trading days
in late February and March 2020 than any other historical period (Baker, Bloom, Davis, Kost, Sammon,
and Viratyosin, 2020). The 34% drop in the S&P 500 index between February 19 and March 23, 2020 is
the most dramatic opportunity yet for researchers to study investor behavior following a spike in volatility
and a sharp decline in asset markets.
In this paper, we analyze the behavior of 401(k) plan participants between December 31, 2019 and
March 31, 2020. Our main research question is whether professionally managed retirement accounts
insulate participants from the negative effects of sentiment-driven trading in retirement accounts. Although
retirement savers may be less experienced and more prone to making investment mistakes than investment
professionals, the majority of workers (59%) now delegate the management of their retirement portfolios
through target date funds (TDFs) or robo-advised managed accounts (Vanguard, 2019). 1 These automated
investment vehicles grew in popularity as default investment options in the years following the Pension
Protection Act of 2006 (Balduzzi and Reuter, 2019; ICI, 2019). Prior research has demonstrated that TDFs
are preferred by less financially sophisticated plan participants (Madrian and Shea, 2001; Mitchell and
Utkus, 2012; Goda et al., 2019; Chalmers and Reuter, 2020). This self-selection arises the possibility that
delegated portfolio management prevents those participants who are most likely to exhibit a behavioral

1

A given TDF provides the same asset allocation to all participants of a similar age without regard for employee
characteristics or risk preferences. When the target retirement date is distant, the allocation to equity is typically near
100%; as the target retirement date approaches, equity is replaced with debt, resulting in less market risk. The slope
is known as the “glide path.” Balduzzi and Reuter (2019) document significant heterogeneity in the glide paths of
TDFs. Robo-advised “managed accounts” incorporate individual characteristics such as current wealth, salary, savings
rate, employer contribution, gender, and existing pensions. The percent of employers offering a managed account
option rose from 29% in 2011 to 66% in 2019 and assets increased from $108 billion in 2012 to $348 billion in 2019
(Cerulli, 2020).

trading response from trading during a financial crisis. Simultaneously providing the option for participants
to self-manage a retirement portfolio preserves choice for more sophisticated investors who can select
investments from a core menu that match their own preference, and who may be less likely to exhibit
behavioral biases of their own (Campbell, 2016).
Prior studies of defined contribution trades find that participant investment changes are rare. For
example, over a 52 month period, Agnew, Balduzzi, and Sunden (2003) find that 87.5% of the 401(k) plan
participants in their sample make zero trades and 93.2% make no more than one trade. In another early
study of self-directed plan participants, Mitchell, Mottola, Utkus, and Yamaguchi (2006) find that fewer
than 20% make changes to their accounts in a 2-year period and that half of these participants make only a
single trade. In more recent data, Vanguard (2019) finds that only 8% of participants initiate any trades
within their accounts.
Despite low trading frequency, retirement plan participants control an increasingly large share of
the market for financial assets. Defined contribution plan investors hold $8.2 trillion of the $21.1 trillion
invested in U.S. mutual funds (and 53% of equity, hybrid and bond mutual fund assets), which represents
12% of total equity ownership and 60% of all retirement wealth (ICI, 2019). Furthermore, a significant
negative economic event may motivate account changes by participants. Tamborini, Purcell, and Iams
(2013) document that employees in industries negatively impacted by the 2007-2009 financial crises were
more likely to decrease in contribution rates and increase plan withdrawals. Sialm, Starks and Zhang
(2015a) document that outflows from equity mutual funds within DC plans are more sensitive to
macroeconomic conditions than funds owned outside of retirement plans.
Investment mistakes made inside of retirement plans are likely to impact both when participants
can afford to retire and the standard of living during retirement. Because TDFs played a much smaller role
in 401(k) plans during the global financial crisis, the vast majority of TDF participants have only experience
a bull market. A central policy question is whether the market turmoil induced by COVID-19 lead less
sophisticated investor to abandon TDFs and even-newer robo-advised accounts for safer funds, thereby
locking in market losses.
2

Analyzing 617,376 participants across 531 retirement plans, we ask which types of participants
were the most likely to make changes to their retirement accounts, with a focus on the extent of portfolio
delegation. We have four main findings. First, delegated participants are significantly less likely to make
any changes to their retirement portfolios than non-delegated participants. This is true in the raw data, when
we find that only 2.0% of delegated participants make any changes versus 16.6% of non-delegated
participants. It remains true when we estimate probit regressions that control for a large set of participant
characteristics and include either industry or plan fixed effects. The fact that participants who opt into or
are defaulted into robo-advised managed accounts are both less likely to make portfolio changes than
participants who invest in a single TDF suggests that increased levels of trust in customized portfolios is
not driven by self-selection. The fact that delegated participants have average characteristics that would
point to lower levels of financial sophistication suggests that increased delegation through the use of TDFs
and managed accounts as default investment options, may limit the extent to which less sophisticated
participants make mistakes. The fact that participants stuck with TDFs during the first bear market since
2009 suggests that TDFs will prove to be effective long-term investment vehicles.
Second, among the non-delegated participants, the likelihood of portfolio changes appears to be
increasing in proxies for investor sophistication, such as salary, deferral rate, and account balance. In other
words, the set of participants making changes to their retirement portfolios appear to be a relatively
sophisticated subsample of a relatively sophisticated population.
Third, because our sample of retirement plans span 20 industries, we are able to document
significant heterogeneity in job loss, changes in deferral rates, and withdrawal activity across industries, as
well as in reliance upon delegation. While we generally find that participant decisions about loan activity
and withdrawals are driven by the economic shock of job loss rather than the level of portfolio delegation,
we find some evidence that reductions in deferral rates are least likely among participants invested solely
in TDFs and participants defaulted into managed accounts, the two groups of participants that we estimate
are the most likely to rely upon default deferral rates.
Finally, consistent with the idea that portfolio changes were disproportionately made by the most
3

sophisticated participants, we do not find any evidence that portfolio changes are associated with lower
quarterly returns. While our need to estimate quarterly returns adds noise to this analysis, it appears unlikely
that the participants making portfolio changes in response to COVID-19 (but who did not experience job
loss) managed to liquidate plan assets at the bottom of the market.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our empirical setting, the
characteristics of delegated and non-delegated participants, and univariate evidence on portfolio changes.
Section 3 provides industry-level statistics on the use of delegation and on the frequency of job loss, plan
withdrawals, and portfolio changes. Section 4 relates portfolio changes and other participant choices to
delegation and a large set of participant characteristics. Section 5 contains our analysis of quarterly portfolio
returns. Section 6 concludes.
2. Characteristics of delegated and non-delegated 401(k) plan participants
Our 401(k) plan sample includes 617,376 participants across 531 plans, offered by firms within 20
broad industries. 2 The data come from a single recordkeeper with a market share outside of the top ten. We
observe participant portfolio allocations and balances on both December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020,
along with characteristics such as age, salary, plan tenure, gender (when reported), traditional and Roth
employee deferral rates, and plan participation status. Collectively, these participants managed $75.0 billion
on December 31, 2019 and $65.3 billion on March 31, 2020. As we describe below, we infer participantdirected portfolio changes from changes in allocations and (return-adjusted) changes in balances. So that
we do not mistakenly attribute changes due to menu changes to plan participants, our sample excludes any
plans that are flagged as having made menu changes during the first quarter of 2020. In addition, our
measures of portfolio change exclude a small number of fund re-mappings that we identified within 35
plans. These re-mappings, often across different shares classes of the same fund, collectively impact 12,990

2

We include all plan participants for whom plan tenure is nonnegative (i.e., excluding participants who were not yet
eligible to join the plan on December 31, 2019), for whom age is between 20 and 75, and for whom the employee
deferral rate is no higher than 30.0%. Collectively, these filters cause our sample size to decrease by 2.8% (from
635,116 to 617,375). In addition, we possess limited data on 9,446 participants who had positive account balances on
December 31, 2019 but zero account balances on March 31, 2020.

4

(2.1%) participants. 3 Because we cannot observe investment choices within self-directed brokerage
accounts (SDBA), our sample excludes any participants with a positive SDBA allocation or balance on
December 31, 2019. However, because we are interested in measuring portfolio changes, we retain those
participants with a positive SDBA allocation or SDBA balance on March 31, 2020.
We classify participants into five groups based on their allocations and balances on December 31,
2019. Three of these groups involve delegated portfolio management. The largest of the delegated groups
consists of participants who allocate all of their contributions to a single target date fund (TDF) and who
do not have a positive balance in any other fund. TDFs vary their asset allocation based on the number of
years to a pre-specified target retirement year (e.g., Fidelity Freedom 2040 Fund). TDFs became the most
popular default investment option within 401(k) plans in the years immediately following the passage of
the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (ICI (2019), Balduzzi and Reuter (2020)). 4 “Pure TDF” participants
account for 43.1% of our participant sample and 16.3% of plan assets. While it is likely that the majority
of Pure TDF participants were defaulted into TDFs, this is not something that the recordkeeper tracks. The
other two groups of delegated participants invest through robo-advised managed accounts (MA), either by
choice or by default. Robo-advised managed account products are a natural extension of TDFs. They
provide participants with portfolios that are customized with respect to the expected number of years to
retirement, but also with respect to other sources of investor heterogeneity, such as the level and
composition of other retirement assets (including expected Social Security benefits), and the level of risk
aversion. Collectively, managed accounts account for 10.5% of plan participants and 7.7% of plan assets.
We observe two participants who are defaulted into a MA for every one participant who opts into a MA.
Across the three groups, delegated participants account for 53.6% of participants and 23.0% of plan assets.
The other two groups of participants manage their own retirement portfolios, at least in part. Selfdirected (SD) participants, who allocate their contributions to one or more non-TDF option, account for

Sialm, Starks, and Zhang (2015b) highlight the extent to which defined contribution flows are driven by plan sponsor
decisions to add and remove funds from their menus.

For example, Figure 8.14 of the 2019 Investment Company Institute Factbook report that the market share of TDFs
rose from 19% in 2006 to 52% in 2016.

39.5% of participants and 68.0% of plan assets. The remaining 6.9% of participants and 9.0% of plan assets
are classified as “Mixed TDF” (Pagliaro and Utkus (2017)). While Mixed TDF participants allocate 100%
of their contributions to a single TDF, they maintain positive balances in one or more additional funds,
suggesting either that there were not defaulted into TDFs or that they have subsequently chosen to transfer
some of their plan assets from TDFs into other funds.
We describe our sample in Table 1. On December 31, 2019, the average participant is 44.3 years
old, with 7.1 years of plan tenure, an annual salary of $97,600, and an account balance of $113,600. Our
sample is broadly consistent the sample described in Vanguard’s How America Saves 2019. 5 Consistent
with the aggregate statistics that we just cited and earlier research on the demand for TDFs (e.g., Utkus and
Mitchell (2012), Chalmers and Reuter (2020)), delegated participants tend to be younger, with shorter plan
tenures, lower salaries, and lower balances. For example, Pure TDF participants are significantly younger
than SD participants (42.0 years old on December 31, 2019 versus 46.8), and their average account balance
is considerably lower ($43,100 versus $195,500). The other groups fall between these two extremes, with
Mixed TDF being the second oldest (45.4), with the second highest account balance ($147,500).
The average employee deferral rate is 5.4%; this rate is highest among SD participants (6.5%) and
lowest among participants defaulted into a managed account (3.9%). We infer the default employee deferral
rate within each plan from the median deferral rate of plan participants with a tenure of less than two years.
The fraction of all participants whose individual saving rate matches the inferred default rate is 10.3%. It is
highest for Pure TDF participants, many of whom appear to be accepting the default savings rate and the
default investment option, and lowest for Mixed TDF participants. The fraction of participants with a
positive Roth account balance is 17.7%; this fraction is much higher for SD participants and for those opting
into the MA. The fraction of participants who rolled assets into their 401(k) account is 11.4%; it is also
much higher for SD participants and for those opting into the MA. Overall, the differences in participant

5

Vanguard reports a median age of 44, median plan tenure of 7 years, median participant income of $70,000, median
participant account balance of $22,217, and average participant account balance of $92,148. Within our sample,
median age is 43.7, median tenure is 5 years, median active participant income is $68,000, median active participant
account balance is $31,399, and average active participant account balance is $119,097.

characteristics suggest that through some combination of self-selection and differential reliance upon
defaults, the typical delegated participant is likely to be less financially sophisticated than the typical nondelegated participant (Chalmers and Reuter (2020)). Whether less sophisticated investors were willing to
stick with delegated portfolios during the turbulent market of 2020Q1, and whether there were any
differences in the behavior of TDF versus MA participants, are two of our research questions.
The fraction of plan participants classified as “active” at the end of 2019 is 81.9%. The fraction of
participants classified as “active” on December 31, 2019 but “terminated” on March 31, 2020 is 3.3%.
Changes in employee deferral rates are relatively common. The fact that increases are more common than
decreases (11.8% versus 6.7%) may reflect plans automatically escalating participant deferral rates
effective January 1, 2020. While we do not observe an auto-escalation flag from the recordkeeper, the vast
majority of these increases (8.1% of the 11.8%) are exactly 1 percentage point. During the same period,
6.7% of participants reduced their deferral rate, with the largest decreases among those who opted into the
managed account.
The fraction of participants with a positive loan balance on December 31, 2019 is 16.4% and,
conditional on having a positive loan balance, the average ratio of loan balance to account balance is 17.6%.
Less than 1% of participants take out a new loan between December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. Because
we cannot directly observe partial withdrawals, we assume that they occur whenever the balance on March
31, 2020 is less than 50% of the balance on December 31, 2019. By this measure, the fraction of participants
with a partial withdrawal is also less than 1%. The fraction of participants who withdraw their entire account
balance is 1.4%. (Because we observe limited data on the 9,446 participants with positive account balances
on December 31, 2019 and zero account balances on March 31, 2020, we exclude them from the five
subsamples.) The gender variable is “Male” for 47.6% of participants, “Female” for 31.6%, and “Unknown”
for the remaining 20.8%. It is much less likely to be unknown among MA participants.
The number of funds held varies significant across participant type. On December 31, 2019, the
average SD participant has positive allocations to 6.2 funds and positive balances in 6.8 funds. For
participants investing through a MA, both numbers are approximately twice as high, reflecting the fact that
7

the managed account product works by allocating dollars across funds on the plan menu. Based on our
classifications, Pure TDF and Mixed TDF participants have a 100% allocation to a single TDF. However,
for Mixed TDF participants the average number of funds with a positive balance is 2.9. Across all
participant types, the numbers of funds with positive allocations and balances are quite similar when we
hold participant type constant and follow participants forward from December 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020,
suggesting a high level of inertia by participants.
The final set of rows calculate the fraction of each participant’s portfolio that is allocated to equity.
We assign a representative fraction of equity to each of the 84 Morningstar categories represented in the
portfolio holdings data (summarized in Table OA1). We use these statistics to calculate allocation-weighted
and balance-weighted measures of equity exposure on both December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. Of
course, declines in the fraction of equity are to be expected given the poor relative performance of equity
funds during the first quarter of 2020. To minimize the impact of fund returns on equity exposure, we also
report balance-weighted fraction of equity after “deflating” each March 31 2020 balance by either the fund’s
quarterly return or the Morningstar category’s quarterly return (when then fund’s quarterly return is
missing). 6 When focusing on allocation-weighted statistics, we find that average equity exposure decline
0.6% (from 74.5% to 73.9%). When comparing balance-weighted statistics in December 2019 to deflated
balance-weighted statistics in March 2020, we also find that average equity exposure declines 0.6% (from
75.1% to 74.5%). These comparisons are consistent with the vast majority of participants making no
changes to their portfolios during the first quarter of 2020.
2.1. Frequency of changes in participant type?
To begin to shed light on the extent of portfolio changes by 401(k) plan participants, in Table 2,
we use the fund allocation and balance data available on December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020 to identify
transitions between participant types. We find that participant type is highly persistent over this quarter.

6

We do not observe quarterly returns for the subset of investment options that are not mutual funds (e.g., collective
investment trusts). We also do not observe the level or timing of any employee or employer contributions between
December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020.

8

Fewer than 2.0% of the delegated participants begin managing their own portfolios. This finding suggests
that the vast majority of the younger, less sophisticated participants being defaulted into TDFs chose to
stick with delegated management throughout the turbulent quarter. In contrast, approximately 5.8% of
Mixed TDF participants change type, with 3.8% moving towards increased delegation and the other 2.0%
moving to decreased delegation. Self-directed participants are the least likely to change type. Fewer than
0.5% of SD participants change type by enrolling in a managed account or allocating their contributions to
a TDF.
2.2. Frequency of changes in fund allocations and fund balances?
In Table 3, we summarize the extent to which participants make changes to their fund allocations
or fund balances. We consider four types of changes: changes in fund allocations that are accompanied by
fund additions and/or removals; changes in fund allocations that are not accompanied by fund additions
and/or removals; fund additions and removals that are not accompanied by changes in fund allocations; and
(imputed) fund exchanges between the existing set of funds. We report the sum of these four changes for
different subsamples of participants in column 2 (and we report the disaggregated statistics in Table OA2).
Overall, we find that 8.7% of participants made changes to their portfolios during the first quarter of 2020.
Importantly, this average masks significantly heterogeneity across participant types. For delegated
participants, the likelihood of any portfolio change ranges from 1.3% for participants defaulted into MA to
2.1% for participants investing entirely in a single TDF. Given the plausibly lower sophistication levels of
the typical delegated participant, this inertia is likely to reflect high levels of trust in delegation, low levels
of attention, or both. The fact that likelihood of any portfolio change is lower for the managed account
products may suggest slightly higher levels of trust in a customized portfolio than a TDF. Nevertheless, the
fact that the vast majority of TDF participants “stayed the course” during a quarter of unprecedented market
volatility is encouraging evidence that TDFs may provide value during both up and down markets. In
contrast, for non-delegated participants, the likelihood of portfolio changes jumps to 15.1% for SD
participants and 22.7% for Mixed TDF participants.
The remaining columns of Table 3 shed light on the extent to which changes in fund allocations
9

and exchanges across funds changed the equity exposure of participants’ portfolios. For example, column
6 reports the fraction of participants whose change in fund allocations or fund exchanges reduce the equity
exposure of their portfolio 10 percentage points or more. To determine if fund allocations reduce the equity
exposure by 10 percentage points or more, we compare the allocation-weighted fractions of equity using
fund allocations on December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020 and the assumed equity exposures in Table
OA1. Because we use the same assumed fractions of equity on both dates, this measure will be zero if the
participant does not make any allocation changes or if allocation changes are limited to funds with the same
assumed fraction of equity. To determine if fund exchanges reduce the equity exposure by 10 percentage
points or more, we compare the balance-weighted fraction of equity using actual fund balances on
December 31, 2019 and quarterly-return-adjusted fund balances on March 31, 2020, and again using the
assumed equity exposures in Table OA1. Based on these measures, we see that many of the portfolio
changes are modest in size. While 16.6% of non-delegated participants make a change to their portfolios,
only about half (8.7% equals 5.0% in column 4 plus 3.7% in column 5) result in equity exposure increasing
or decreasing by more than five percentage point. Nevertheless, non-delegated participants remain
significantly more likely than delegated participants to make large changes. For example, 5.2% of selfdirected participants make a change of at least 20 percentage points (3.7% in column 8 plus 1.5% in column
9) versus 0.9% for Pure TDF (0.7% plus 0.2%).
3. Variation in participant choices and likelihood of economic shocks across industries?
To the extent that some industries experienced COVID-19-related economic downturns before
others, we might expect to see differences in participant behavior across industries. In Table 4, we report
selected summary statistics by industry. We assign each plan to an industry based on the first two digits of
the firm’s 6-digit NAICS. The two largest industries, in terms of number of firms and number of active
participants, are Professional/Scientific and Manufacturing. However, we observe plans across a wide range
of industries, including Construction, Food Services, and Retail Trade. As a simple way of capturing
differences in participant sophistication across industries, we report the fraction of active participants within
each industry that invest through TDFs or managed accounts. The fraction is relatively high for Food
10

Services, Health Care, and Retail Trade; it is lowest for Education (represented by one small plan), Public
Administration, and Management.
Overall, 4.0% of participants transition from being “active” on December 31, 2019 to “terminated”
on March 31, 2020. We cannot distinguish participants who quit their jobs from those who are fired.
However, these separation rates vary across industries in ways that are likely to reflect variation in the
extent of layoffs, from a low of 2.0% for Utilities to a high of 16.5% for Food Services. They also seem
more likely to be impacting industries with less sophisticated participants; the correlation between the
fraction of delegated participants and the average separation rate is positive (0.2657).
When we scale the number of new plan participants during the first quarter of 2020 by the number
of active participants on December 31, 2019, the replacement rate averages 0.3%. Consistent with the
unprecedented surge in COVID19-related unemployment claims during March 2020, the replacement rate
is significantly lower than the separation rate within each industry. Consequently, there are fewer active
plan participants within each industry on March 31, 2020 than on December 31, 2019.
While 401(k) plan participants may begin withdrawing cash to make up for reduced or lost wages,
we observe relatively little such behavior during the first quarter of 2020. We estimate that only 0.7% of
participants who are active on December 31, 2019 take a significant withdrawal from their account by
March. The lowest withdrawal rates are 0.0% for Education and 0.3% for Public Administration; the highest
is 3.7% for Construction. Another 0.8% of participants withdrawal all of their plan assets during 2020Q1.
Because we are focusing on participants who were active on December 31, 2019 and because full
withdrawals are only possible following job lose, this statistic implies that about one in five participants
(0.8% scaled by 4.0%) who are terminated during the quarter withdrawal all of their plan assets. The fraction
of participants taking partial or full withdrawals are also positive correlated with reliance on delegation
(0.2903 and 0.3432, respectively).
As we saw in Table 1, employee deferral rates are more likely to increase during the first quarter
of 2020 than to decrease, although this likely reflects increases due to automatic escalation. The fraction of
participants decreasing their deferral rate by any amount is 8.0%, the fraction increasing by exactly one
11

percentage point is 9.7%, and the fraction increasing by more than one percentage point is 4.3%. The
frequency of rate decreases is positive correlated with reliance on delegation (0.2550), but so is the
frequency of rate increases of more than one percentage point (0.1700).
Finally, the fraction of active participants who make any change to their portfolios is 9.1%, which
is slightly higher than the 8.7% for the full sample of active and inactive participants. While the likelihood
of making any changes to portfolios varies significantly across industries, from a low of 2.8% for
Construction to a high of 18.1% for Professional/Scientific, this can largely be explained by the differences
in reliance upon delegation. The correlation between reliance on delegation within an industry and the
likelihood of making any portfolio changes is strongly negative (-0.7741).
4. Predicting changes in plan participant behavior
We begin by asking how the likelihood of making portfolio changes varies with the extent of
delegation and other participant characteristics and then consider choices related to loans, deferral rates,
and withdrawals that may have been triggered by economic shocks.
4.1. Is delegation associated with fewer portfolio changes?
The univariate comparisons above reveal delegated participants are significantly less likely to make
portfolio changes (or large changes in equity exposure) than non-delegated participants. At the same time,
differences in the characteristics of delegated and non-delegated participants suggest significant sorting into
delegation. To shed additional light on which participants were the most likely to make changes to their
401(k) portfolios during the first quarter of 2020, in Table 5, we use measures of delegation to predict the
likelihood of portfolio changes while controlling for various participant characteristics.
We estimate a series of Probit regressions. The dependent variable in columns 1 through 3 equals
one if participant i made any changes to her 401(k) account between December 31, 2019 and March 31,
2020, and zero otherwise. Each specification includes participant type fixed effects (“Pure TDF” is the
omitted category), the full set of participant characteristics described in Table 1, and a full set of equity
exposure category fixed effects based on fund balances on December 31, 2019 (“0-9%” is the omitted
category). We also control for the predicted volatility of daily portfolio returns using initial fund balances
12

and daily returns throughout the quarter. Column 1 controls for the average level of the dependent variable
in other plans within the same industry, excluding the participant i’s plan. Column 2 adds industry fixed
effects to control for any average industry-level shocks that drive portfolio changes and also controls for
the average level of the dependent variable within participant i’s plan, excluding participant i. Column 3
adds plan fixed effects to control for any average industry-level shocks that drive portfolio changes.
Standard errors are clustered on plan. Across these columns, the unconditional likelihood of making any
portfolio changes is 8.6%.
We find that the likelihood of making any changes tends to increase in account balance, salary,
deferral rate, positive Roth account balances, and positive rollover balances, all of which are likely to be
positively correlated with the level of participant sophistication. It also tends to increase by approximately
1.3 percentage points following job loss, highlighting the link between portfolio changes and individual
economic shocks. With respect to portfolio composition on December 31, 2019, higher levels of equity
exposure tend to be associated with lower likelihoods of making portfolio changes, while higher standard
deviations of daily returns (measured within these categories) tend to be associated with slightly higher
likelihoods of making portfolio changes. The predictive power of other participant changes (in column 2)
may reflect peer effects within the plan, fund re-mappings that we failed to identify when analyzing changes
within plans, or both.
The fact that pseudo-R2 nearly doubles when we include the industry fixed effects (from 0.1476 to
0.2841) reflects the systematic differences in the likelihood of portfolio changes across industries that we
observe in Table 4. The magnitudes of the marginal effects associated with Mixed TDF and Self-directed
participants both decrease when we include the industry fixed effects, but do not change much more when
we include the plan fixed effects. Importantly, after including all of these controls, we continue to find
statistically and economically significant differences in the likelihood of portfolio changes across
participant types.
Focusing on the participant type dummy variables in column 3, which focuses on variation across
participant types within plans, we find that managed account participants are 2.3-2.4 percentages points
13

less likely to make any portfolio changes than Pure TDF participants (both differences statistically
significant at the 1-percent level). These estimates suggest that managed accounts may be even more
effective than TDFs in allowing participants to weather volatile markets. The fact that the estimates are
quite similar for those who are defaulted into managed accounts and those who opt into these products helps
to allay concerns about these differences are driven by self-selection into managed accounts. (In none of
the specifications can we reject the hypothesis that participants defaulted into managed accounts are more
or less likely to make portfolio changes than participants opting into managed accounts.) Everything else
equal, we also find that Self-directed and Mixed TDF participants are 9.8 and 15.1 percentage points more
likely than Pure TDF participants to make portfolio changes.
The remaining columns predict more extreme portfolio changes. Column 4 focus on participants
who increase or decrease their equity exposure by 10 percentage points or more, while column 5 uses the
threshold of 20 percentage points or more. The means of the dependent variables fall from 8.3 percentage
points to 3.6 percentage points and 2.7 percentage points, respectively. The marginal effects on the various
participant characteristics are qualitatively similar to those in column 3. Two notable exceptions are the
change in the sign of the marginal effect on participant age (from negative and statistically significant to
positive and statistically significant), and the emergence of a slight gender divide. In the spirit of Barber
and Odean (2001), males are 26 to 31 basis points more likely to make a large change and females are 26
to 43 basis points less likely to make a large change. Again, however, we continue to find that managed
account participants are less likely to make portfolio changes than Pure TDF participants, and that nondelegated participants are more likely to do so.
4.2. The limited role of delegation in explaining other participant choices
In Table 6, we analyze four additional choices that participants may have made in response to the
COVID-19 shock: increased loan activity, decreased deferral rates, made a partial withdrawal, or made a
full plan withdrawal. To the extent that these choices are triggered by economic shocks rather than by broad
market returns or volatility, we do not expect them to be systematically related to the level of delegation,
except insofar as industries with different levels of reliance on delegation are differentially impacted by
14

COVID-19 during the first quarter of 2020. The probit specifications are similar to those estimated in Table
6. By including industry fixed effects, we control for average differences in participant choices across
industries. All plan-level measures exclude the choices of participant i.
The dependent variable in column 1 equals one if participant i increases her plan loan balance,
either by increasing the balance on an outstanding loan or by opening a new loan, and zero otherwise.
Because loans are generally only available to active participants, we limit the sample to participants who
are active on both December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. We also exclude a small number of plans for
which there are no positive loan balances on December 31, 2019, to eliminate plans that do not offer access
to 401(k) plan loans. Within this sample, only 2.3% of participants increased their loan activity. The single
best predictor of increased loan balances during the first quarter of 2020 is a pre-existing loan balance,
which may capture pre-existing liquidity constraints. The marginal effect is 3.7 percentage points and
statistically significantly different from zero at the 1-percent level. Increased loan activity within the plan
by other participants has a positive and statistically significant marginal effect, suggesting correlated loanseeking behavior within plans, perhaps because of common economic shocks with firm, but the effect is
economically modest because the standard deviation of this measure is only 1.5 percentage points.
Differences in choices across participant types are even smaller. For example, everything else equal, Selfdirected participants are 11 basis points less likely to increase their loan balances (statistically significant
at the 5-percent level but economically insignificant).
In column 2, we switch our focus to reductions in participant deferral rates. To eliminate the
mechanical relationship between job turnover and deferral rates going to zero, we limit the sample to
participants who are active throughout the first quarter of 2020 and have a positive deferral rate on
December 31, 2019. Here, we find evidence that delegation matters. Pure TDF participants (omitted
category) and those defaulted into managed accounts are the least likely to reduce their deferral rates, as
are those participants who appear to have accepted the defaulted deferral rate within their plan. Other
predictors include pre-existing loan balances, which point to pre-existing liquidity constraints, but also
higher salaries, rollover balances, and Roth balances, which point to higher levels of sophistication.
15

We predict partial plan withdrawals in column 3 and full plan withdrawals in column 4. In column
3, the sample includes all active and inactive participants during the quarter except for those who
withdrawal all of their account assets. In column 4, we expand the sample to includes these additional
participants, but are forced to reduce our set of independent variables because we lack data on how these
participants were invested on December 31, 2019 and several other variables. As we document in Table 1,
both outcomes are rare. We infer a significant plan withdrawal when the account balance on March 31,
2020 is less than 50% of the balance on December 31, 2019. The dependent variable equals one for 0.8%
of the participants in column 3 and for 1.4% of the participants in column 4. In both specifications, the
single best predictor of a withdrawal is separation from the firm. The marginal effect is 5.1 percentage
points with respect to partial withdrawals and 19.5% with respect to full withdrawals. In other words,
approximately 20% of newly terminated participants remove all plan assets and another 5% remove some
plan assets. (Participants terminated before December 31, 2019 are the omitted category.) To the extent that
terminated participants were liquidating plan assets at deflated equity prices to finance these withdrawals,
the economic shocks driving withdrawals also served to lock in the (temporary) market losses.
5. Are portfolio changes associated with higher or lower quarterly returns?
In Table 7, we compare the quarterly returns of participants who do and do not make changes to
their portfolios. We consider three definitions of portfolio changes. The first definition includes any changes
to fund allocations, fund additions and removals, and other imputed fund exchanges, the second definition
captures increases or decreases in equity exposure of 10 percentage points or more, and the third definition
captures situations where Mixed TDF and SD participants become managed account or Pure TDF
participants.
We do not directly observe quarterly returns. Our dependent variable is the percentage change in
participant i’s account balance between December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. To account for the impact
of equity exposure on realized returns, we include balanced-weighted equity exposure decile fixed effects.
To account for average differences in the (unobserved-to-us) level of employer contributions across plans,
we include two fixed effects for each plan, one for active participants and the other for inactive participants.
16

To account for the impact of ongoing employee contributions, we control for the predicted contribution
amount over the quarter (monthly salary times employee deferral rate times three) scaled by the account
balance on December 31, 2019. We include one set of predicted contributions for participants who are
active through March 31, 2020 (because they are likely to make contributions all three months) and another
set for participants who are terminated between December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020 (because they are
unlikely to make contributions all three months). We also directly control for job loss during the quarter.
Finally, in the specifications that pool Mixed TDF and SD participants, we include a dummy variable to
test whether Mixed TDF participant earn systematically different quarterly returns than SD participants.
With the goal of minimizing noise, we limit the sample to those participants for whom we do not infer any
plan withdrawal (by eliminating participant observations with a quarterly return below -50%), with a
December 31, 2019 balance of more than $1,000, with a contribution-implied return of less than 25%, and
an estimated quarterly return that is below 100%. 7 To allow for correlated quarterly returns within plan, we
cluster standard errors on plan.
Within the pooled sample of managed account participants, we estimate that participants making
portfolio changes earn quarterly returns that are 84 basis points lower than participants not making changes,
but we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no difference in performance at conventional levels. Similarly,
while we estimate that job loss is also associated with lower returns, this estimate also is not statistically
distinguishable from zero.
For the third group of delegated participants, Pure TDF, we estimate that portfolio changers earn
quarterly portfolio returns 2.2 percentage points higher than among non-changers with similar equity
exposure (statistically significant at the 1-percent level), while those suffering job loss earn quarterly returns
that are 1.5 percentage points lower. It is conceivable that the lower returns in the accounts of those losing
jobs reflect employee and employer contribution reductions that are not fully captured by our predicted
contribution measure and fixed effects. When we focus only on large portfolio changes we estimate that

7

These filters reduce our sample by 2,583 participants, 7,211 participants, 7,958 participants, and 717 participants,
respectively.

17

changes in either direction are associated with higher quarterly returns. Because we do not observe the dates
on which portfolio changes are made, we do not know if changes in different directions occurred at different
points in time and we do not know if intermediate changes were made during the quarter. We also are
unable to adjust portfolio returns for changes in risk. Regardless, with the possible exception of managed
accounts, we are not finding any evidence that portfolio changes are associated with lower returns.
Our findings for non-delegated participants, in columns 4 and 5, are broadly similar to our findings
for Pure TDF participants. Namely, portfolio changes are associated with higher quarterly returns and job
loss is associated with lower quarterly returns. However, within this sample, the higher returns appear to be
driven by reductions in equity exposure. Finally, we estimate that increased delegation increases quarterly
returns by 48 basis points relative to other portfolio changes, but the standard error is large. The fact that
participants making portfolio changes appear not to have been harmed during the first quarter of 2020 is
consistent with earlier finding that less sophisticated participants were less likely to make portfolio changes,
especially those with delegated portfolio management.
6. Conclusion
We analyze 401(k) plan participant behavior during the first quarter of 2020, a quarter that was
marked by historical levels of volatility and large negative returns as the COVID-19 pandemic impacted
product markets and labor markets alike. Analyzing 617,376 participants across 531 plans in 20 industries,
we ask which types of participants were the most likely to make changes to their retirement portfolios, with
a focus on both the extent of portfolio delegation and individual economic shocks.
Consistent with several earlier studies, we find that the typical participant delegates all of her
portfolio management to a TDFs or robo-advised managed account, and that these participants tend to be
younger, with lower salaries, lower deferral rates, and lower account balances. Within this sample of
plausibly less sophisticated participants, only 2.0% made any changes to their retirement portfolios and less
than 1.0% made large changes to their equity exposure. Following the passage of the Pension Protection
Act of 2006, which increased the use of TDFs as default investment options, U.S. equity markets
experienced their longest bull market in history, increasing over 300% between March 2009 and December
18

2019. The low rate at which participants abandoned TDFs and managed accounts during the first quarter of
2020 suggests that participants are willing to stick with delegated investment options like TDFs even during
volatile, down markets. The finding that both types of managed account participants were less likely to
make portfolio changes than Pure TDF investors suggests that managed account participants may have
higher levels of trust in portfolios because of the increased customization.
Among non-delegated participants, the likelihood of making portfolio changes is significantly
higher, but tends to be positively correlated with proxies for investor sophistication. In other words,
portfolio change was most likely among a relatively sophisticated subsample of a relatively sophistication
group of participants. The notable exception is the increased likelihood of large portfolio changes by
participants who experienced job loss during the quarter.
After documenting significant differences in the likelihood of delegation and job loss across
industries during the first quarter of 2020, we analyze a broader set of participant choices. We find that
partial and full withdrawals are primarily driven by job loss, but that Pure TDF participants and participants
defaulted into managed accounts are the least likely to reduce their deferral rates. These are the two groups
of participants who are the most likely to accept the plan’s default deferral rate. We also find that within
our sample of plans, there are 15 active participants who are terminated during the quarter for every one
participant who becomes an active participant. To the extent that this pattern generalizes, it suggests that
most of the withdrawals around job loss are unlikely to reflect rollovers into the 401(k) plans of new
employers. Whether they reflect rollovers into checking accounts or IRAs, however, we cannot say. To the
extent that participants were liquidating equity at deflated prices to finance liquid savings or consumption,
these participants were locking in market losses.
When we estimate quarterly returns for participants without a partial or full withdrawal, we find
that they tend to higher, rather than lower, following portfolio changes. The exception is a negative but
statistically insignificant estimate for managed account participants, suggesting that robo-advised managed
account participants are the least likely to benefit from managing their own portfolios.

Portfolio delegation and 401(k) plan participant responses to COVID-19

June 6, 2020

Table OA1
In Table OA1, we list each of the narrow investment Morningstar categories that are represented
by participant holdings across the 531 plans, as well as company stock and self-directed brokerage accounts
(SDBA). “Assumed % Equity” is the fund’s assumed allocation to equity. These are based on historical
averages for each category of mutual fund, through December 31, 2019, rounded to the nearest 5 percentage
points. When calculating our measures of equity exposure, we use the same fraction for all funds with the
same narrow investment category and for both December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. Calculating
portfolio-level measures of equity exposure provides us with a coarse measure of portfolio risk that can
easily be compared within and across participants, summarized in Table 1. The limitation is that assumed
equity exposure ignores the fact that 100% invested in small-cap equity is riskier than 100% in large-cap
equity, and it ignores variation in the riskiness of long-term corporate debt versus short-term government
debt. Despite these limitations, the correlation between our assumed equity exposures, which and average
fund-level returns during the first quarter of 2020 is -0.7495.
We report total assets under management and the fraction of assets under management within each
narrow category, on both December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. Changes in AUM reflect the combined
effect of new contributions, withdrawals, exchanges, and fund returns. The correlation between these
category-level percentage changes in AUM and the average fund-level return within the category is 0.6929.
The AUM in Personal Choice Retirement Accounts on December 31, 2019 is $0 because we exclude
participants with positive account balances from our sample.
We also report the number of mutual funds and the total number of investment options within each
category. The total number includes separate accounts and collective investment trusts, for which we lack

1

return data. Approximately 70% of the 2,391 distinct investment options across the 531 plans are mutual
funds. (According to Figure 3.16 in the 2019 Investment Company Institute Factbook, 22% of assets in
“large 401(k) plans” were held in collective investment trusts in 2017, up from 6% in 2000.) For the subset
of mutual funds, we report the average return over the first quarter of 2020 and the cross-sectional standard
deviation of quarterly returns. We also report the average after-fee return for mutual funds within the
category. The correlation between our average fund-level returns and the category-level returns from
Morningstar is 0.9811.
Table OA2
In Table OA2, we assign potential portfolio changes into four categories, which are mutually
exclusive and sum to the probability of “any change.” Column (4) reports the fraction of participants who
made any changes to fund allocations and added balances to at least one new fund and/or removed balances
from at least one prior fund. Column (5) reports the fraction of participants who made any changes to fund
allocations without adding or removing any funds. Column (6) reports the fraction of participants who
added balances to at least one new fund and/or removed balances from at least one prior fund without
making any changes to fund allocations. After correcting for the small number of fund re-mappings,
changes in fund allocations and fund additions and removals are unambiguous signals of participantdirected changes. Finally, column (7) reports the fraction of participants who are estimated to have made
fund exchanges without adding or completely removing any funds. Because we do not directly observe any
variable that flags partial exchanges, we infer these exchanges by comparing the actual balances of each
fund on March 31, 2020 to predicted balances based on fund (or category) returns. To appear in column
(7), the maximum difference between predicted and actual balances across all of the participant’s funds
must exceed 10%.

Table 1.
401(k) Participant characteristics by investor type.
This table reports summary statistics for the full sample and separately for five types of participants: opted into managed account, defaulted into managed account, 100% allocation to a single TDF and no other fund balances, 100%
allocated to a single TDF but additional fund balances, and self-directed participants (who are enrolled in neither a managed account nor allocate 100% to a single TDF). Unless otherwise stated, all variables are measured on December
31, 2019. The full sample is limited to plan participants between the ages of 20 and 75 with a non-negative plan tenure on December 31, 2019 and a deferral rate that is no more than 30%. We lack a gender variable for 20.8% of
participants. Because participant allocations across funds need not align with their balances, we report the numbers of funds with positive allocations and positive balances. The "% Equity" variables report equity exposures (reported in
Table OA1) weighted by allocations to the fund or the fund's balance scaled by the account balance. In one case, we deflate the balances on March 31, 2020 using the fund (or category) return during 2020Q1, to minimize the impact of
2020Q1 returns on ending balances.

Table 2.
Transitions between participant types.
This table describes participant type transitions between December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. In addition, we report the fraction of participants who change type,
change type in a manner that increases the level of portfolio delegation (e.g., transitioning from self directed to a managed account), and the fraction that have a positive selfdirected brokerage account balance (SDBA) on March 31, 2020.

Table 3.
Likelihood of participant-directed portfolio changes.
This table reports the likelihood of participant-directed portfolio changes by participant type. In addition to reporting the fracton of
participants for whom we detect participant-directed changes in fund allocations and/or fund balances, we report the fraction of participants for
whom the net change in equity exposure due to either changes in allocations or changes in fund balances is at least 5 percentage points, at least
10 percentage points, and at least 20 percentage points.

Table 4.
Industry-level statistics on separations, withdrawals, deferral rates, and likelihood of portfolio changes.
This table reports selected summary statistics from Table 1 and Table 3 by industry. It focuses on participants who are active on December 31, 2019, but also reports the number of participants
who become active by March 31, 2020 scaled by the number of active participants on December 31, 2019. Partial withdrawals, changes in deferral rates, and changes in portfolios are calculated
for the subsample of participants without a complete withdrawal.

Table 5.
Predicting portfolio changes during 2020Q1.
This table reports marginal effects estimated via Probit. The dependent variable in columns (1), (2), and (3) equals one if participant i made any changes to her portfolio during 2020Q1,
and zero otherwise. The dependent variable in column (4) equals one if participant i increased or decreased her exposure to equity by 10 or more percentage points (as indicated in columns
(6) and (7) of Table 3), and zero otherwise. The dependent variable in column (5) is defined similarly, using a threshold of 20 percentage points. The "% Changes in industry" variable
measures the average value of the dependent variable in all other plans within the same industry. The "% Changes in plan" variable measures the average value of the dependent variable
within the plan, excluding participant i. Equity exposure fixed effects are based on fund balances on December 31, 2019. Columns (2), (4), and (5) include industry fixed effects. Column
(3) replaces industry fixed effects with plan fixed effects. Coefficients and standard errors are multipled by 100, so that a marginal effect of 1.00 corresponds to an increase of one percentage
point. Standard errors are clustered on plan and reported inside parentheses to the right of coefficients.

Table 6.
Predicting plan withdrawals and increased loan activity during 2020Q1.
This table relates participant type to other portfolio choices during 2020Q1. We report marginal effects estimated via Probit. The dependent variable in column (1)
equals one if participant i increased her loan balance or initiated a new loan during 2020Q1, and zero otherwise. The sample is limited to participants who are active at
the beginning and end of 2020Q1, and to plans in which at least one participant had a positive loan balance on December 31, 2020. The dependent variable in column
(2) equals one if participant i reduced her deferral rate by at least one percentage point during 2020Q1. The sample is limited to participants who are active at the
beginning and end of 2020Q1, and who have a positive deferral rate on December 31, 2020. The dependent variable in columns (3) equals one if participant i made
an (imputed) partial withdrawal from her account during 2020Q1, and zero otherwise. The dependent variable in column (4) equals one if participant i withdraws all
plan assets during 2020Q1, and zero otherwise. The limited set of independent variables reflects the limited data that we possess on participants who have an account
balance of $0 at the end of 2020Q1. In particular, we can control for neither participant type nor equity exposure categories. Equity exposure fixed effects in the other
columns are based on fund balances on December 31, 2019. All specifications include industry fixed effects. Coefficients and standard errors are multipled by 100, so
that a marginal effect of 1.00 corresponds to an increase of one percentage point. Standard errors are clustered on plan and reported inside parentheses to the right of
coefficients.

Table 7.
Are portfolio changes associated with lower realized quarterly returns?
This table relates estimated participant quarterly returns during 2020Q1 to measures of portfolio change, job loss, and equity exposure (based on fund balances on December
31, 2019). The measures of portfolio changes are a dummy variable that equals one when the participant makes "any change" (column (3) in Table 3); a dummy variable that equals
one when the exposure to equity decreases by 10 percentage points or more (based on either allocations or return-adjusted changes in account balances); a dummy variable that
equals one when the exposure to equity increases by 10 percentage points or more (based on either allocations or return-adjusted changes in account balances); and a dummy
variable that equals one when the participant transitions from Mixed TDF or SD to Pure TDF or MA. Our measure of job loss is whether a participant is classified as terminated
during 2020Q1.We estimate separate specifications for three subsamples of participants (as classified on December 31, 2020): those invested through managed accounts; Pure TDF;
and Mixed TDF plus Self-directed. Quarterly returns are inferred from changes in balances between December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. We control for the level of predicted
retirement contributions during the quarter using annual salary and deferral rate data from December 31, 2019, scaled by the balance on December 31, 2019. We include one
measure for participants who are still active on March 31, 2020 and another measure for participants who are terminated before March 31, 2020, to capture average differences in
the level of participant contributions. We include plan fixed effects interacted with whether the participant is active on December 19, 2019 to control for variation in the level of
employer contributions across active and inactive participants (which we do not directly observe). We include equity exposure category fixed effects based on fund balances on
December 31, 2019. We exclude participants with full or (imputed) partial withdrawals (i.e., those with imputed returns below -50.0%). We also excluded participants for whom the
estimated quarterly returns were likely to be particularly noise due to the timing and level of retirement contributions. Namely, we exclude participants with estimated quarterly
returns in excess of 100.0%, participants for whom predicted portfolio contributions were likely to increase the estimated quarterly return by 25% or more, and participants with
December 31, 2019 balances of $1,000 or less. Coefficients and standard errors are multipled by 100, so that a marginal effect of 1.00 corresponds to an increase of one percentage
point. Standard errors are clustered on plan and reported inside parentheses to the right of coefficients.

Table OA2.
Likelihood of participant-directed portfolio changes.
This table reports the likelihood of participant-directed portfolio changes by participant type. Column (3) reports the likelihood of any
change. For participants investing through a managed account, column (3) reports the fraction who stop using the managed account
product during 2020Q1. For all other participants, column (3) reports the sum of the likelihoods in columns (4) through (7). Column (4)
contains the fraction of participants who changed fund allocations and also added or removed funds. Column (5) contains the fraction of
participants who changed fund allocations without adding or removing any funds. Column (6) contains the fraction of participants who
added or removed funds without changing fund allocations. Column (7) contains the fraction of participants that neither added nor
removed funds nor made any changes to their fund allocations, but for whom we infer a fund exchange.
