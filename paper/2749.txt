whether to abort. A family that decides to abort a fetus testing !positive faces a third

An alternative approach, testing all fetuses, would require performing amniocentesis or CVS

and would be prohibitively

expensive unless these procedures were being

performed for other reasons. We further assume that the sensitivity

of the

probe would be 99%. Using these assumptions, we calculate the potential costs and benefits

of such testing, and show how the estimated benefits vary as we alter the assumptions about
the costs of the hypothetical

DISCUSSION
Although they have not undergone extensive clinical evaluation,

RFLP-baued tests appear

to be highly sensitive and specific assays for genetic diseases. For many of the csnditions
that they detect, alternative

tests are either inaccurate or unavailable.

Cystic fibrosis is perhaps the most promising candidate for prenatal screening becausv
