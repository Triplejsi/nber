INTRODUCTION
This paper both documents the involvement of developing

countries in coalitional activity in the current .GATT Uruguay
round thus far, and provides a rudimenting evaluation of the pros
and cons of the different options for them as far as coalitional
strategies are concerned. Coalitionai activity in this trade
round,

unlike earlier rounds, has been marked and, especially the

mid-sized market oriented, developing countries have been
centrally involved.

There has been consIderable discussion as to

whether small group coalitions offer developing countries more

ocrtnities

for dealing with theIr access problems in trade

negotiations compared to a go—it—alone country—by—country
approach, or a bloc—wide (377) strategy.

This paper is an

attempt to deal with these issues.
Since there is little or no meaningful economic theory on
which to draw in evaluatIng coalltional options in trade
negotiations, the approach taken here is largely inductive.3

A

profile of experience thus far is assembled, and generalizations
and evaluations offered from this.

Our main conclusions are that much of the coalitional
activity involving developing countries thus far in the round has
been agenda—moving and joint proposal—making, rather than
negotiating involving exchanges of concession.

At the sane time,

theoretical papers by inmore (1985) and
Several of these try to develop an axiomatic approach to
ooalitional activity, but are so far removed from actual trade
negotiations as to be of lIttle help.

others.

however,

coalitional activity by a larger group of mid—sized

developed and smaller developing countries who see a major
interest in preserving the multilateral system has been central
to the process.
In the paper,

we argue that agenda—moving and proposal—

making coalitions seem much easier to form and maintain than
negotiatidg coalitions.

It is, therefore an open question as to

how much further scope there is for coalitional actitity by
developing countries in the later phases of the round.

As it-

accelerates towards its negotiations phase, we see an important
role for the larger coalition of both smaller developed and
middle—sized developing countries whose main concern is over the
erosion of multilateral disciplines under the

O-Afl system.

Issue—specific coaliti.ons either exclusively involving developing
countries,

we see

as

or involving both developed and developing countries

more problematic and ultimately unstable.

Whether all of this upsurge of coalitional activity in trade
negotiations represents an improvement for developing countries
we also see as an open question.

On the one hand,

issue—specific

small group coalitions offer individual developing countries the
chance to pursue their narrower country interests and perhaps
achieve more than if such coalitions did not form.

On the other

hand, a proliferation of small group -coalitions weakens the grand

coalition of all developing countries, which takes a more
systemic approach.

TRADE NEGOTIATIONS AND COALITIONS

Although

only

at its mid-stage, the current (eighth) GATI

round of trade negotiations has already made its mark by being
different in nearly all ways from its predecessors. It has an
agenda which is dramatically broader than previous rounds in
covering such items as services,
agriculture,

textiles,

intellectual property,

investment and others.

Thus in contrast

to earlier rounds only small amounts of negotiating effort have

thus far been devoted to tariff cutting.
Also,

during its critical phases in early 1986, the final

launch of the round reflected a major and extremely determined
effort initiated by smaller and middle—sized developed countries
(EFTA, Canada,

Australia, New Zealand) in which a number of mid-

size market-oriented developing countries (Columbia, Venezuela,
Uruguay, Zaire, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia) played a key role.
These countries were jointly concerned over the implications for
the multilateral system should

a round

not be launched and they

were successful in influencing events in a major way.

The

direction of the round has also been significantly influenced by
two important issue—specific coalitions,
"Cairns'

one in agriculture (the

group of 14 developed and developing countries),

and the

other in services (involving ten, so—called "hardline",
developing countries opposed to the inclusion of services in the
trade round).
Thus, while still limited,

the participation of developing

countries in the round has thus far been both more active and

5

more pluralateral than in previous rounds which, defacto, were
largely EEC—US negotiations. This has led to considerable
discussion of both the merits of and possibilities for
coalitional activity in trade negotiations, especially as far as
smaller developing countries are concerned (see Ostry,

Why

has an upsurge in this type of activity occurred now,

and why did it not occur in earlier rounds?

Is it for real,

or

will it begin to break down when the serious negotiating activity
gets underway, since what has occurred thus far has largely
involved agenda-moving coalitional activity rather than
coalitions which actually bargain via an exchange of concessions.
And what of the interests of the middle—sized and smaller

developing countries who have been especially prominent in this
activity. Can they be furthered through this activity, or are
these drawbacks to their participation in this way?
Country Objectives in Trade Necotiations
The reasons why countries participate in multilateral trade
negotiations are many and varied.
on mercantilist bargaining,

Early GATT rounds were based

with participating countries offering

to bind or reduce tariffs protecting the home market in return
for improvements in access to foreign markets.

But since those

days, the objectives that countries seek to achieve through GATT

negotiations have proliferated and become many and varied.
For some, the use of an international negotiation as a way
of binding domestic policy is

a major objective; supposedly one

of the major reasons, for instance, for Mexican accession to GATT

6

in 1986.

For others, the successive increase through recent

rounds in the importance of rule making as against bargaining on
trade barriers has lead them to concentrate most on influencing
the

way

rules are written via the consensual GATT rule—making

procedure.

There are also countries (such as Brazil and India,

and to a lesser extent Canada, Australia, New Zealand) whose
participation seems driven largely their search for a rule—based
rather than a power—based trading order.

Their concern is to

prevent the erosion of multilateral disciplines agreed both in
the GATT itself, and in earlier rounds.

Countries also have more

distant motives, such as Japan's desire to keep multilateral
negotiations going, since it helps in dealing with bilateral
pressures from the US congress for market opening in Japan.
Others are driven by concerns over issues which, for them,
dominate all others being 'discussed in the GATT (such as
Argentina on agriculture)

.

And finally, there are countries who,

while remaining members of GATT, participate little in
negotiations.4
How and Why Coalitions Form
Whether or not coalitions form during GATT trade
negotiations, and what these coalitions try to do is a direct
reflection of what the negotiations are about, and how they are

conducted.

Because the process of negotiation in the GATT is

sequential,

involving first an agreement on an agenda of issues
followed by the tabling of proposals

to be negotiated upon,

around the agreed agenda issues, with subsequent negotiation
based on these proposals, the process inevitably generates
several different types of coalitions.
At one level there is pernanent and ongoing coalitional

activity in the GATT.

At present there are 96 GATT contracting

parties and 30 or so other countries with de facto GATT
nembership, and country delegations are continually in touch one
with another.

or

more major matters such as the rossible joint tabling of a paper,
or how to react to a proposal.

Delegations seem to talk to or contact the sane delegations
repeatedly,

and as they jointly discuss various issues closeness

of position on a range of issues develops.

These may be groups

of African countries, discussing sinilar problems; India and
Brazil with their joint systemic concerns; Korea, Hong Kong and
Singapore with their concerns over market access for
manufacturers; or Australia, New Zealand and Canada with their
agricultural interests.

There are also more formalized groupings

of countries, such as the ASEAN countries who are currently try
to coordinate their positions on issues discussed in GATT working

groups through regular inter—country meetings at trade officer
level.

Types of Coalitions in Trade Negotiations
Defining coalitions in GATT trade negotiations is therefore
difficult.

We will, for convenience as much as precision, refer

to a coalition as any group of decision makers participating in
the negotiation who agree to act in concert to achieve a common

end.5

This concept of a negotiating coalition differs from

coalitional concepts used in other areas of economic analysis.

behaviour toward other actors",

.

See Debreu and Scarf (1963).

9

As a result, it is also unclear what form of coalitional
activity in trade negotiations is in the interest of developing
countries.

One can argue that with a snall group issue—specific

ccalitional approach to trade negotiations, developing countries
with access difficulties in certain product areas (such as
Argentina with agriculture) can form coalitions with countries
with similar interests, and have a better chance of inproving
theirposition compared to a go—it—alone approach.

On the other

hand, such activities serve to weaken the grand coalition of all

developing countries (sffectively,

the 077 in UNCTAD)

which can

defend and hopefully improve the trade rules which apply to then
all, such as those which currently apply under the general

heading of "special and differential" treatment.7 What types at
coalitional activity in trade negotiations are good or bad for

develoing countries

are not clear a priori.

Thus far, in the 7ruguay Round, coalitions have taken
several different forms

which they are interested can be given a higher profile than if
they try to promote them on their own.

These coalitions are

relatively easy to form since the countries who join do not have
to agree how they would make concessions

on other issues.

With the agenda framed, coalitions have also formed to make
joint proposals.

Jointly tabled proposals usually suggest either

changes In existing trade barriers being discussed in one of
several negotiating groups, approaches to rule makIng in new
areas,

or set out joint positions indIcating the conditions under

which changes should be made.

Joint proposals have been a

comnonly used coalitionaa tactic in this round in contrast to
earlier rounds.8 Again, these coalitIons are relatively easy to
form since no common set of concessions need to be agreed by
members of the coalition.

During the Tokyo Round, some developing countries proposed
that they be able to negotiate jointly on issues of concern to
them where indIvIdually they were not principal suppliers of
products. The weakness of this approach was that, when requested
to make concessions, some countries In the coalition were
reluctant to do so or would not go far enough to the taste of
other coalition members. This was because of concerns that
problems could arise in subsequent renegotiations under Article
XXVIII of GATT (re—tarfficatIon). See GATT (1974), o. 92.

since participants in the coalition nust agree both on what they
want and what they are willing to give up.
Issue—specific negotiating coalitions raise special
difficulties.

Requests made by the coalition will typically be

part of a set of wider demands made by each country as part of
the negotiations.

And since countries typically wish to balance

their positions across all the issues that are of interest to

it,

they need to reserve some degree of flexibility to allow for

changes in position on various issues as part of the negotiating
processes.

Such changes nay well be inconsistent with agreenents

that countries have entered into in order to join the coalition.

These coalitions are, therefore, dIfficult to naintain.

They

tend to be more resilient where the issue at stake are of cajor

agriculture for most of the Cairns group countries)
Other difficulties also arise with negotiating coalitions,

degree of flexibility to be able to maneuver and respond to
offers made by other parties.9

COALITIONAL ACTIVITY AND THE LAXJNCH CF THE URUGUAY ROUND
Coalitional activity in the Uruguay round involving

developing countries began as part of the process through which
the round was launched, covering the period between the end of
the Tokyo Round in 1979 and the Ministerial meeting in Punta del
Este in September 1986 which launched the round.

Because of the

importance of these events to understanding how coalitional
activity in the present round has evolved,

in this section we

document these events in some detail and draw some implications
for developing countries and their involvement in coalitions.

November 1979

—

October

1982

At the end of the Tokyo Round in November 1979,

it was

widely felt that there was unfinished business left over from the
round, particularly in the areas on safeguards and agriculture.

There were also misgivings in some quarters about certain
features of the

Toicyo

Round results particularly the MTN codes

which introduced the threat of discrimination through the
application of conditional

MFN treatment.

Also, although special and differential treatment for

developing countries had been given high profile in the
negotiations, there was a feeling that these provisions did not
meet the needs of the developing countries within the trading
system.

Among the developing countries (and some smaller

developed countries) there were misgivings that they had not been
able to participate more fully in the negotiations, and that they

14

had simply been presented with the results on a take it or leave
it basis.
In the years immediately following the Tokyo Round, most of

the activity in the GATT concentrated on implementing the tariff
and non—tariff barrier agreements from the round.

The sense that

there was outstanding unfinished business created resistance in
some quarters to the idea of considering fresh initiatives for
trade liberalization.

At this time, these were coming mainly

from the US.

The November 1982 Ministerial

The November 1982 Ministerial meeting was unprecedented for
the GATT.

This was the first time that such a complex agenda

spanning such a wide variety and volume of issues had been agreed
to.

The new issues areas,

especially in

services, also proved to be a major bone of contention for the
developing countries, and specifically for Srazil and India.

In

the end, all that could be agreed to was to exchange information.

16

The 1982 Ministerial meeting was considered by all
participating countries to have been a total failure.

What might

have been the start of a process towards the launch of a new
trade round ended up being a Work Program for two years that did
not commit anyone to anything.

The Work Program proceeded during

the two years after the 1982 Ministerial Meeting.

In some areas

little progress was made, while in other areas, such as
agriculture, useful preparatory background work was completed.
Concern began to grow, however, over what would follow now
that the Work Program was coming to an end.

How was the momentum

for trade discussions of interest to those countries concerned
over a possible future further erosion of the multilateral

trading system to be maintained?
November 1932 to January

l96

Early in 1984, the Japanese joined with the Americans in
calling for a new trade round, and by the end of 1934, all the
industrIal countries were on board as far as a new round was
concerned.

However,

large numbers of developing countries were

unconvinced of the justification for a new round, arguing that
unfinished business of the Tokyo Round remained unresolved and
was reflected in the policies being currently pursued by the
industrial countries. They also were fearful of pressure being
used against them in the new areas (services, intellectual
property, and trade—related investment),

and were concerned over

an erosion of special and differential treatment.

Significant

17

numbers of developing countries thus continued to oppose the
launch of a new round up until mid—1985.
Agreement to move further towards a launch of a new round
occurred in July 1985 but only after lengthy and bitter
discussions

The Preparatory Committee started its work in

January of 1986 againSt a background of uncertainty and suspicion
among the Contracting Panes as to where the process should and
could lead.

There were fundamental differences in opinion among

delegations over the introduction of new issuesinto GATT
negotiations, and over the order of negotiating priorities.
Because of these differences,

the CATT Secretariat was unable to

even draft a declaration for discussion.

This stalemate over how

to reach a draft of a declaration for the launching of the round

provided the ccnditions for subsets of normally minor players to
act as catalysts to keep events moving.

The drafting of the

declaration became an exercise in coalitional

activity,

and

through this the round was launched.
The EFTA Process and the 910 in Early 1986

Around May 1986, two declarations emerged from different
groups of contracting parties. One came from a group of ten
developing countries (the 910), lead by Brazil and India.

This

document proposed a narrow set of issues for negotiation and
established a number of conditions to be fulfilled before
negotiations could be launched.

This document was perceived by

others outside the group as a way of blocking negotiations, or at
least slowing down the process.

18

At approximately the same tine, six EFTA countries, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand (G9) put forward their own draft
declaration, and subsequently invited some developing countries
to

As the date for the Ministerial 'ieeting approached,

it

became increasingly clear that agreement on a single text for
Ministerial approval was not going to be possible.

Argentina,

fearing implications for its agricultural interests in the round
proposed a third draft which it hoped would bridge the gap
between what had now become a solidly supported Swiss-Colombia
proposal from the EFTA process and the GlO text.

The Chairnan of

the Preparatory Committee forwarded these three texts of

a

possible declaration to the Ministers at Punta del Este.
However,

the effort on the third text came too late and was not

given serious consideration.

19
Events at Punta del Este

Early on in the week of meetings at Punta del Este, separate
groups were established tb address agrioulture (on which there

had been

no agreement in the Swiss—Colombia text) and services.

Meanwhile, the Chairman of the Ministerial Meeting formed a
heads—of-delegations group, which went through the various issues
for negotiation.

Mid-way through the week the Chairman convened

a small group of approximately

20 ministers to hopefully break

the deadlock over the three draft declarations.

After

acrimonious exchanges of views within this group, it was finally

negotiation of the final declaration. During the next two days:
Brazil,

India and other members of the 010 issued a range of

Dr000sed amendmemts to the Swiss—Colombia text, but were again
unsuccessful.
The groups in services and agriculture continued to meet,

Services was the

first issue settled when they managed to agree on a text which
emphasized institutional separation,

growth and development to be

in any
given priority, amd national sovereignty to be respected
negotiations. The text on agriculture was agreed next, followed

by trade related intellectual property and trade—related
investment.
Despite some last minute manoeuvreing by the BC over
the issue of how amy balance—of-benefits in the subsequent
in
negotiation was to be evaluated, the declaration was adopted
the Plenary meeting of the following day.

20

Coalitional activity was thus central to the launch of the
round,

and a successful launch would likely not have occurred

without It.

Issue—specific coalitions on agriculture and

services (discussed below) were equally important in shaping the
agenda for the round, and In framing the resulting declaration.
Thus far, the round that has followed has been more pluralistic

with wIder participation from developing countries than in any
previous round and with a larger focus on coalitional activity as
a way of achieving country objectives.

All of this is, in part,

a reflection of the way the round was launched.

Rounds.

While tariffs are low in developed countries,

The possible use of tariff bindings as a way of extracting
concessions in other groups nay be an option for some developing
countries to consider.
In the non—tariff measures group,

the main issue for

developing countries is how to bring unjustified quantitative
restrictions more fully under the system. Their concern will be
to do this in ways which do not limit their own use of

quantitative restrictions. The natural resources group also
raises tariff escalation issues, and offers interesting
possibilities for coalitions between developed and developing

for instance)

The fifth group, agriculture, is probably the key to the
round, and the European position is probably central to what
to be dealt with
happens in agriculture. The two issues likely
here are domestic subsidies and export subsidies. Both the US

and the Cairns group (covering

14 developed and developing

countries) have concrete liberalization proposals.

However, the

is that, in
impression conveyed by the current European proposal
the long run, a market-sharing arrangement limiting the budget

costs of agriculture is what is sought.
This need not significantly liberalize agricultural trade,

and could be disadvantageous

for

develoing country agricultural

in the
exporters (and particularly potential new exporters
future) who could be effectively excluded from shared trade.

And

for the developing countries who are agrIcultural importers,
there could be higher prices rather than benefits from
agricultural subsidies.

And if

the EEC, the other agricultural exporters, and Japan on

agriculture, the sense seems to be that
difficult for anything of substance to happen in other

negotiating groups.
In tropical products,

•the

central issues are again tariff

escalation, coverage, and the linkage to agricultural
and
negoUations, although there are also health, sanitary
seasonal restrictions faced by developing countries.

Tropical

27

products is one of the main areas in which the Punta del Este
declaration indicated hopes for quick progress.10
In the GATT articles group,

a large number

of articles have

already been discussed and may become subject to negotiation.
Perhaps the most important from a developing country point of

view

is Article 18(b) dealing with balance—of—payments exceptions

for the use of quantitative restrictions.

Developing countries

have, however, taken a substantial interest
areas including Articles 24, and

ifl

a number

of other

28.

The MTN agreements and arrangements group is specifically
focussed on the question of codes, and the anti—dumping, import
licensing and technical barriers to trade codes are among those
that have received the most attention. Particularly important
here for developing countries, is the issue of restricted
application of MTN codes through the conditionality introduced in
the Tokyo Round.

The safeguards group nay well prove the most important area
of negotiation for developing countries in the round.
Safeguards,

as is well known, was deadlocked during the Tokyo

Round on the issue selectivity, and developing countries are
-

under pressure once again

to allow selectivity.

They now,

10 Tropical products is also an area where
reciprocity could
be an important issue.
The developed countries stressed prior to
the round they had gone as far as they could unilaterally, and
the time had come for developing countries to reciprocate if
further liberalization was to be achieved. The EEC has included
a provision requesting reciprocity in their proposal. The US has
tied progress on tropical rcducts to progress in agriculture.
The prospects for early results here appear less optimistic than
a year or six months ago.

28

however, have stronger offensive rather than defensive objectives
in the safeguards area,

in the sense of achieving firmer

disciplines over safeguards measures by developed countries.
This,

in turn, would hopefully make it more difficult for

developed countries wishing to use voluntary export restraints
against developing countries.
as to argue that

Some commentators have gone so far

a possible deal between developed and developing

countries on Articles 19 and 18(b) might be feasible, given the
importance of each of these articles (in opposite directions) to
the two groups of countries.

The group on subsidies and countervailing measures is
important to developing countries because they have been one of
the major targets for countervailing duty actions since the

completion of the Tokyo Round.'1

There are also questions of

export subsidies, particularly in the context of agriculture and
the wider definition of subsIdization under the subsidies code.
The groups on intellectual property and investment are part
of the "new areas' covered In the round; the objectives being to
bring intellectual property issues into the framework of the
GATT,

and to also deal with trade—related investment measures

within the GATT framework.

Developing countries are generally

cautious about these two areas.

They see them as threatening

national sovereignty in the case of investment restrictions, and

Abreu and Fritsch (988) note the high percentage of
affirmative CVD actions against developing country exporters in
the industrialized countries of the US, EEC, Canada and Australia
(see table 4, p.32).

29

as forcing firmer national intellectual property rights in cases
where they are users of intellectual property.

There is a strong

feeling that these issues are outside of the mandate of the GATT,
and that by bringing them in, issues of longstanding concern to
developing countries will be neglected.

There are also concerns

that a broadening of the GATT in this way will ultimately be used
to put pressure on developing countries.
In the dispute settlement area,

the main issues concern the

enforcement of panel rulings and dispute settlement procedures
covering grey areas.

Developing countries certainly have

interests in this area, especially as they would nct wish to be
subjected to bilaterally negotiated disputes.

Here the issues involve

ministerial involvement in the

decision—making in the GATT, and a surveillance body in the GATT
to enable monitoring of trade policies and practices of

contracting parties.

The developing country concern is that an

imbalance in obligations towards surveillance will result and
developed countries will be relatively less accountable.
Finally, in the services area, there are many wide—ranging
issues, since this is the most ambitious of the various attempts
to extend the GATT to cover new areas.

First, there are

conceptual difficulties as to how to define services.
there are major data problems.

Then,

There are also differences of

Developing country concerns, however, focus on national

security and sovereignty, along with their economic concerns over
protecting infant service industries.

V

ISSUE—SPECIFIC COALITIONS IN THE TRADE ROUND
There have been several examples thus far of issue-specific

coalitional activity in the round.

These involve both coalitions

formed prior to the launch at Punta del Este, and coalitions of a
proposal—making type which have energed subsequently. Genuine
negotiating coalitions have yet to form.
Services
In the services area, 10 developing countries12 led by India

and Brazil consistently argued against inclusion of services in
the run up to the launch of the round.

For

a variety

they did not want to see services in the round.

of reasons,

At a ninimun,

they wished to separate the discussion on services from
discussion of goods, so as to weaken the linkage between the two.
They also wished to promote an all encompassing concept of
special and differential treatment including services, and argued
that the standstill and rollbacc tro'rision from the 1982

Ministerial should be more firmly implemented before any further
discussion of services occurred.
The coalition initially consisted of Argentina, Brazil,
India, Egypt and Yugoslavia —

derogatioris from the GATT represented by grey

area measures, had, in their opinion, to addressed first.
There was also a strongly held belief, especially by India
that,

in and of itself,

liberalization in services was not

desirable, since developing countries needed strong infant
industry protection for their service industries if they were to
survive.
Secause of the desire by the

maoc developed countries

for a

genuine multilateral negotiatio on services which would include
all contracting parties to the GATT, and its further desire to
maintain consensus in the GATT Council, these developin
countries were able to exercise sufficient leverage to have a
two—stage negotiating process establishsd in the Round whils
reporting tO a common trade negotiations committee.

Their objective was to

consolidate the views of countries and coordinate their efforts
to defuse the subsidy war between the US and the EC.

A second

meeting was held in Pattaya, Thailand in July, at which time the
group expanded to include Chile, Hungary,

Thailand and Canada.

Australia took the lead role when it hosted the third
meeting of agricultural exporters in Cairns, Queensland, one
nonth before the Punta del Este meeting.

Fourteen agricultural

exporters were invited, 13 including a number of smaller ASEAN
countries, Canada, Brazil, Argentina and Chile.

The United

States, Japan and the EC were invited with observer status.

The

Cairns Group, as it has become know, has become the first example
of

a concrete developed—developing country coalition.
The Cairns and Pattaya meetings served to dramatize the

level of concerns among agricultural exporters over the issue at

agricultural access.

Participants in the coalition were able to

heighten awareness over the effects of the crisis in world
agricultural trade, which in their view had sharply reduced farm
incomes, depressed export earnings, reduced their capacity to

their development and growth possibilities and created social

and; in some cases, political tensions.14

Their main objective

was to see that a clear and unequivocal commitment to
liberalization in agriculture be included in any Ministerial
Declaration which might emerge from Punta del Este.

The pressure

exerted by the Cairns group was one of the factors which led the
European COmmunity to agree in Punta del Este to an inclusion of
discussions on agriculture in the trade round, over initial
strong objections by France and Italy.

Their position has been made especially difficult

the fact that the US has tied progress on tropical products to

progress on their proposal for agricultural liberalization.

Because Canada is a

it tends to weaken the credibility of the

coalition as a whole.

Thus, while endorsing the Cairns

agricultural proposal in the GATT, Canada has also tabled its own
proposal for liberalization.
Brazil also has voiced differing views on PSE5.

Some

developing countries, led by BrazIl, have argued strongly that
the principle of special and differential treatment is of

overriding importance to developing countries, and dominates
their interests in agriculture, per se.

Brazil has therefore

argued that any negotiated agreements which have the effect of
bringing agriculture more fully into the GATT framework must be
achieved in ways which respect special and differential treatment
for agriculture.

This position caused difficulties in developing

a common proposal within the Cairns group with some of the

developed countries, and especially Canada,

The Cairns group,

been successful in meeting its original agenda—moving objectives.

DEVELOPING COUNTRY INTERESTS AND COALITIONAL ACTIVITY IN THE

As the mid—term review

approaches in December, it may be helpful to reflect on how
coalitional activity has progressed, what the prospects are for
the next two years of negotiations, and whether this activity ia

Thus far, there have clearly been some successful agenda—

moving issue—specific coalitions.

Developing countries have

played central roles in these, such as Cairns in agriculture, and

There has also been unprecedented activity in this round in
the form of joint proposals by countries united by a common

interest rather than a north—south ideology.

Despite this, the

prospects for true negotiating coalitions still seem to be
limited.

Even members of the Cairns group emphasize that their

group was never meant to be a negotiating coalition, but a
coalition whose objective was to advance a common position with
the goal of influencing rule—making.

As a

some potential for coalitional activity by developing

countries to influence the outcome remains.
One issue is whether developed—developing country coalitions
will become more common as the round advances.

Such coalitions

have already occurred in the agriculture area with the Cairns
group, and nay evolve

in

other areas such as natural resources,

safeguards, and dispute settlement.

While there are

opportunities for developing countries in such coalitional
activity, both the difficulties of seeing them through as
negotiating coalitions, and the problems of the limited number of
issues where they can be used makes their widespread
proliferation less likely.

There is also the additional

difficulty that expertise in these areas is often scarce,
resources for travel and maintenance of delegations in Geneva are

capitals are difficult, and knowledge, and even interest in
multilateral trade issues by those in political and bureaucratic
leadership positions and private sector interest groups is
sparse.

A

lot remains on the agenda for this round,

including

matters which are of substantial interest to developing
countries.

Coalitions have a role to play, in allowing

developing countries to achieve their objectives, but as more of
these form, especially if they involve both developed and
developing countries, the grand coalition of all developing
countries which seeks to change the system is weakened.

Whether

to use the system as it stands through small group coalitional

activity, or to try to change the system using the larger group
remains the issue.

VIII CCNCLtJOING COMMENTS
This paper discusses coalitional activity involving
developing countries in the present GATT trade round.

It draws

distinctions between the various types of coalitions which now
seen to be emerging, and suggests that although there has been
substantial activity of this form thus far, most of it is of an
agenda—moving or proposal—making type rather than genuine
negotiating activity.
Negotiating coalitions are more difficult to form and
maintain than proposal-making coalitions because negotiating
coalitions involve a two—sided agreement both of what the
countries are willing to give up as well as what they want.
Their Issue—specific nature also makes It difficult for countries
to trade across issues.

The areas of services, agriculture,

safeguards and natural resources are all di.cussed as examples of
what is happening in the

coalitional area.

The paper is inconclusive as to whether such coalitions are
good or bad for developing countries.

On the one hand, through

then individual developing countries can pursue their interests
in particular trade policy issues with better hope of success.

On the other hand,

a series of small group issue—specific

coalitions tends to weaken the grand coalition of all developing
