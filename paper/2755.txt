In a recent survey, Ehrenberg and Schwarz

(1986) comment on this comparison.

What is most striking is how small these numbers typically are!
The estimated relative wage differentials associated with union
membership or collective bargaining coverage are typically smaller
than 10 percent and rarely exceed 20 percent. These estimates are
from private sector

A key Issue Is whether the differences in the magnitudes of union wage
premium across sectors are real or illusory.
Several arguments

exist as to why at least part of this observed

difference may be illusory.

bargaining laws is that no consistent set of results exists.

Results vary

with the type of data used and the type of specification estimated.

evidence has been found in support of the simultaneity hypothesis while
