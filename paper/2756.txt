A THEORY OF MANAGED TRADE

ABSTRACT

This paper proposes a theory that predicts low levels of protection during
periods of "normal" trade volume coupled with episodes of "special" protection
when trade volumes surge.

This dynamic pattern of protection emerges from a

model in which countries choose levels of protection in a repeated game
setting facing volatile trade swings.

High trade volume leads to a greater

incentive to unilaterally defect from cooperative tariff levels.

Therefore as

the volume of trade expands, the level of protectionmust rise in a cooperative
to
equilibrium to mitigate the rising trade volume and hold the incentive

defect in check.

Introduction

Two major trends have dominated the post war history of trade policy in
industrializedcountries.

One is the dramatic multilateral reduction in

tariffs negotiated under the GATT.

The other is the move toward "special"

protection that has occurred as the industrialized countries of the world
have become more integrated and as volatility in trade flows has become a
more important source of domestic disruption.

The rise in special forms of

protection is epitomized by the growing use of Voluntary Export Restraints
(VERs), Orderly Market Arrangements (OMAs), and tariffs that are tailor made
These policy tools are typically

to suit the needs of particular sectors.

utilized by countries to limit the rate of expansion of imports or exports
from that which would occur absent intervention.

The term "managed trade"

is often invoked to characterize the current international
environment,

since it consists of a relatively low "baseline" or "normal"

level of protection combined with the use of special protection to dampen

underlying changes

in trade flows.

The low baseline level of protection sustained by countries

suggests

Nash equilibrium view is inadequate to

explain existing levels of protection.

One alternative way to view the

existing trading environment is that it is the result of explicit agreements
among countries.

This approach to explaining levels of protection has been

taken by Mayer (1981) and Riezman (1982).

However, such explicit agreements

require the existence of a workable enforcement mechanism, and at the
international level it is unclear what that mechanism might be.

A second

alternative is to consider only self-enforcing agreements or tacit
cooperation among countries.

As Dixit (1987) and Jensen and Thursby (1984)

have shown, the (credible) threat of future punishment can sustain a more
liberal trading environment than that predicted under the static Nash

However,

they remain silent on the issue of "special" protection,

take each period to be the same as every other,

since they

In this regard, Corden

(1974) has argued that countries rarely initiate protection for the purpose

of capturing terms-of-trade z&Jaa presumably
due to the fear of future
retaliation by their trading partners, but that countries do employ
protection for its terms-of-tradeeffects in periods when their terms-oftrade would otherwise decline.

Corden argues that retaliation by trading

partners is less likely during such periods.
"special"

This suggests that episodes of

protection might usefully be viewed as part of a tacit

international

agreement in a chanaina environment.

We attempt to formalize this view by considering the way in which
sustainable

levels of protection in tacit cooperative equilibria are

affected by changes in the underlying trade volume.

Since potentially

exploitable terms-of-tradeeffects will embody greater potential national
welfare gains the greater is the underlying volume of trade, periods of high
trade volume are likely to correspond to periods of great incentive to
exercise one's power over the terms-of-trade.

Thus, surges in the underlying trade volume lead to periods
protection as countries attempt to maintain some level of international
cooperation.

In this sense, the model we develop below depicts managed

trade as the outcome of tacit cooperation among countries

in the presence of

volatile trade swings.
We adopt a very simple partial equilibrium framework within which to
make these points.

The next section lays out the basic model under the

assumption of free trade, and calculates the underlying free trade volume as
a function of the parameters of the model.

country whose quota binds--the country with the smaller quota- -will capture
all the quota rents.

This means that, as long as there is trade, each

country can always do better by tightening its quota beyond that set by its
trading partner, which leads to the well-known property that the unique
static Nash equilibrium in the quota game is autarky (see, for example,
Tower, 1975).

However, the fixed

Figure 6.
The autarky threat is in fact optimal over all punishment schemes,
since it represents the most severe punishment which countries will
endure.1°

The extreme severity of the autarky threat, however, may make it

implausible.11

We have thus also explored a softer form of punishment,

where reversion is to the interior equilibrium.

for these two cases then makes it easy to evaluate other punishment schemes.

For example, temporary reversions represent an even milder form of

the more the future is valued,

the more likely it will be that tariffs with

liberal trade.

Protection end the Trade Balance

and protection analyzed in the previous section translates into a
relationship between trade balance and protection.

While the model

A

widening trade imbalance will be associatedwith greater levels of
protection to the extent that the deficit (surplus) country's imports
(exports) increase.

However,

a widening trade imbalance will be associated

with lower levels of protection to the extent that the deficit (surplus)
country's exports (imports) fall.

To show this, we consider the addition of a second sector to the model
of the previous section, and explore the relationship between the bilateral
trade imbalance associated with trade between the home and foreign countries

and their levels of protection.

For simplicity,

we suppose that the home

and foreign country trade only in-these two -products, and that there is a
large rest of the world with which both countries

also trade, so that the

bilateral trade in these two goods is small relative to each country's total
world trade.

Thus, we stay within the partial equilibrium framework

of the

previous sections, and focus on the relationship between bilateral trade
imbalance and protection.1

To keep things simple, suppose that the second product is identical to
the first in every way except that when the first good is imported by the

home country, the second good is exported.

In particular, suppose as before

that the home (foreign) country's endowment of good 1 is given by

Hence, to predl,ct the

relationship between trade imbalance and protection, our model suggests that
information on the sectoral makeup of the trade imbalance will be needed.
We note finally a separate issue that arises with the introduction of
more than one sector:

this is

the notion of multimarket contact developed

by Bernheim and Whinston (1987).

The central idea is that multimarket

Instead, a

bilateral protection.

VI.

Extensions

We discuss in this section a variety of further extensions which can be
introduced to the model.

We begin by exploring the generality of the

relationship between underlying free trade volume and the incentive for
countries to defect that characterizes the model of the previous sections.
The property that at least one countrys incentive to defect from free trade
rises during periods when the underlying free trade volume is high is
crucial in generating the positive correlation between cooperative
protection levels and trade volume depicted above.

We now examine the

generality of this relationship and provide support for a presumption in its
favor.

This supports the presumption in favor of an increasing relationship

transparency)

of our results would be preserved in much more general

settings.

however,

In our partial equilibrium model,

export tsxes are actively employed.

Our modeling approach can be defended on several levels.

The basic

point we develop is that protection is positively correlated with the volume
of trade, since high volume creates a large incentive to defect from tacit
cooperation.

This intuition would also find representation in a multi-good,

general equilibrium model festuring only import taxes.

We believe, however,

thst a partial equilibriummodel offers a simpler, and more appropriate,
characterizationof observed trade wars, which are typically within narrow
product groups.

In this setting, export taxes can not be ignored on a

purely formal basis, and so we have constructed a general model allowing for
both export and import taxes.
It is possible, however, to amend the general model with an ad hoc
requirement that countries are unable to impose export taxes, perhaps due to
political pressures.

In this amended model, there is a unique static Nash

equilibrium in which the importing country chooses the import tax

But, as Dixit (1987) has argued, it is the small 6 case

that is likely to be relevant in the present context, since governments may

the basic insights we have

For example,

suppose instead that trade policy is set by governments with a very specific

competing producers (and their factors of production). Such an objective

is

in the spirit of Corden's (1974) Conservative Social Welfare Function.

VII.

Conclusions

We have attempted to develop a theory of managed trade that correlates
periods of unusually high trade volume with increased protection.

While the

model we have chosen is special in a number of ways, the insights it
generates

appear to be much more general.

In particular, the notion that periods of unusually high trade volume
present countries with an unusually strong incentive to defect from
cooperative trading arrangements seems to be quite general, and forms the
heart of our analysis.

Given this, it follows naturally that countries will

attempt to manage the volume of trade with protective instruments that serve
to dampen fluctuations in trade volume.

Trade management can then be

understood as an attempt by countries to maintain the selfenforcing nature
of existing international cooperation.
Finally, we have emphasized the role of VERa and OMAs in sustaining

tacit cooperation among countries in volatile environments.

An explicit

institutional manifestation of our ideas may be found in the safeguard
provisions of the GATT, whereby countries are given the right to raise
protection in the event of unforseen developments.

Our analysis suggests

a role for safeguard provisions when trade volume is unexpectedly high, as a
means of maintaining the credibility of the GATT

FOOTNOTES

In concluding, Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) conjecture that, when
applied to the study of tariff wars, their framework could yield a
prediction of trade wars occurring in states of depressed demand. Our paper
addresses a different issue, but in a similar spirit. Also, Riezman (1987)
introduces random terms-of-trade shocks into the tariff model of Dixit
(1987). Assuming that countries adopt trigger strategies which require free
trade if free trade prevailed last period and infinite reversion otherwise,
he notes that shocks to the terms-of-trade that increase the current gain
His
from defection will increase the likelihood of Nash reversion.
concern, however, is with the effect of unobservabilityof shocks and
tariffs on the ability of countries to sustain low cooperative tariffs.
Thus for this reason, while the general idea that shocks can effect the
incentives to defect is considered, it is not formally developed.
1.

Our results would differ if countries set ad valorem tariffs, hut not in
a qualitatively important way.
2.

3. Note that, as long as tariffs are not prohibitive so that (1) holds,
prices will only be affected indirectly by the realization of e, through
r and r*. The absence of a direct impact on prices is due to the perfect
negative correlation across countries of the supply shocks we consider.
While a useful simplifying assumption, we argue in section VI that our
results will be preserved in much more general models.

Johnson (1953/54) notes that one country may prefer the (internal) Nash
tariff equilibrium to free trade if its import demand is sufficiently
elastic relative to that of its trading partner.
Keenan and Riezman (1988)
have linked this possibility to differences in country size. While the
symmetry in our model, reflected in the common interior Nash tariffs
defined by (11), does not allow this possibility to arise, the main
complication it would introduce to our analysis is to alter the focus from
symmetric to asymmetric tariff equilibria. See also the discussion in
Section VI.

5.

Correlated shocks are discussed in section VI.

6. It is natural to focus on common protection levels in this simple model,
where countries are assumed symmetric. Moreover, one can show that
symmetric rent-sharing supports the highest degree of cooperation in this
model.
A more general model is discussed in section VI, where our basic
conclusions hold but asymmetries play a real role.

See section VI for a discussion of the generality of this relationship.

A focus on the most cooperative equilibrium seems quite natural in this
context, since countries are free to communicate openly about which self-.
enforcing equilibrium they viii settle on, and the most cooperative
equilibrium is the only symmetric equilibrium that is not Pareto dominated.
Indeed, CATT may be viewed as a forum within which the most cooperative
(self-enforcing) trading arrangements are codified.

schemes which will not be renegotiated, specify asymmetric tariffs (off the
equilibrium path), so that the country which did not cheat enjoys the
punishment phase. For more on the notion of renegotiation-proof equilibria,
see Farrell and Maskin (1987).
12. In fact, a temporary reversion to the interior (autarky) equilibrium
can be identified with an infinite reversion to the interior (autarky)
equilibrium at a lower 6 value. Thus, the above analysis is perhaps most
plausible for small 6, where we have seen that trade is restricted.
13. In terms of Figure 2, defection in the quota game captures the
additional revenue rectangle aklo for the importer or ajik for the
exporter, thus increasing the static gains from defection above that in the
tariff game.
14. See, for example, Bergsten (1982) on the importance of the Japan-U.S.
bilateral trade imbalance in determining levels of protection between the
two countries.
15. See, however, Conybeare (1987), who notes that wool exports from
medieval England were heavily taxed to induc monopoly supply. An export_
tax can also be identified with the more popular strategy of cartelization.
