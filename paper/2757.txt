It could be argued that any sensible user of an econometric model who
was fully aware of the underlying theory, must have known, from the early
days of modern Econometrics and long before Lucas, that when there is a
change in policy regime over the sample period, a suitable shift in the
relevant estimable parameters must be allowed for. Lucas's important
