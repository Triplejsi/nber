ABSTRACT
As of June 2020, the coronavirus pandemic has led to more than 2.3 million confirmed infections
and 121 thousand fatalities in the United States, with starkly different incidence by race and
ethnicity. Our study examines racial and ethnic disparities in confirmed COVID-19 cases across
six diverse cities – Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, New York City, San Diego, and St. Louis – at
the ZIP code level (covering 436 “neighborhoods” with a population of 17.7 million). Our
analysis links these outcomes to six separate data sources to control for demographics; housing;
socioeconomic status; occupation; transportation modes; health care access; long-run opportunity,
as measured by income mobility and incarceration rates; human mobility; and underlying
population health. We find that the proportions of black and Hispanic residents in a ZIP code are
both positively and statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 cases per capita. The
magnitudes are sizeable for both black and Hispanic, but even larger for Hispanic. Although
some of these disparities can be explained by differences in long-run opportunity, human
mobility, and demographics, most of the disparities remain unexplained even after including an
extensive list of covariates related to possible mechanisms. For two cities – Chicago and New
York – we also examine COVID-19 fatalities, finding that differences in confirmed COVID-19
cases explain the majority of the observed disparities in fatalities. In other words, the higher death
toll of COVID-19 in predominantly black and Hispanic communities mostly reflects higher case
rates, rather than higher fatality rates for confirmed cases.

1. Introduction
By June 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. led to over 2.3 million confirmed
infections, over 121,000 fatalities, and almost 31,000 hospitalizations (CDC 2020a,c). Like many
other issues pertaining to health and economic disparities, the burden of the COVID-19
pandemic falls disproportionately on black and Hispanic communities. Through June 13, 2020,
the rate of hospitalization for blacks and Hispanics was more than four times as high as for
whites (CDC 2020b). The pandemic is taking a substantial toll on physical, mental, and economic
health across the U.S., but disparities in whom is impacted by the virus are an additional cause
for alarm.
Part of the barrier to carefully studying disparities from the pandemic — both their
magnitudes and potential explanations — is that current published data on COVID-19 outcomes
are coarse (Killeen et al. 2020). Most studies focus on COVID-19 outcomes at highly aggregated
levels such as the state (Friedson et al. 2020) or county (Courtemanche et al. 2020). Within a
state or county – especially in areas with larger populations – residential segregation by race
and ethnicity can be quite stark, meaning that analyzing disparities at such levels misses an
important part of the variation. Partway through the pandemic, a number of local and state
governments began producing COVID-19 statistics in a more disaggregated fashion — most
commonly reporting confirmed cases by ZIP code. This paper provides, to our knowledge, the
first attempt to systematically investigate racial / ethnic disparities in COVID-19 using these
newly available ZIP code level data. Specifically, we utilize data on confirmed COVID-19 cases
from six cities – New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Baltimore, San Diego, and St. Louis – as well as data
on fatalities from New York and Chicago.
3

Our analysis links these COVID-19 outcomes to six separate data sources to control for
ZIP code level demographics, housing, socioeconomic status, occupational choices,
transportation modes, health care access, long-run opportunity (income mobility and
incarceration rates), human mobility, and population health disparities. This rich set of
covariates allows us to investigate the extent to which mechanisms that have received popular
attention – such as income; education; living in densely-populated communities; reliance on
public transportation; representation in forward-facing, essential jobs; mobility during
lockdowns; pre-pandemic health; and access to health care – contribute to racial and ethnic
disparities (Harrison 2020; Hubler et al. 2020; Oppel Jr. et al. 2020; CDC 2020b). We find
statistically significant and economically meaningful disparities for both blacks and Hispanics at
the ZIP code level in confirmed cases, and most of the disparity is remains unexplained even
after including extensive controls. Without additional covariates, a 10 percentage point
increase in a ZIP code’s share of black residents is associated with 9.2 additional confirmed
COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents, while a similar change in the Hispanic share is associated
with 20.6 additional cases. Both are sizable changes relative to the average confirmed case rate
of 153 per 10,000 population. Using decompositions that are insensitive to the ordering of the
covariates (Gelbach 2016), we find that at least part of these disparities can be explained by
differences in long-run opportunity (income mobility and incarceration rates), human mobility
as measured by cell-phone activity, and demographics. However, even with an extensive set of
controls, more than half of the disparity in COVID-19 cases remains unexplained. For the two
cities where we are also able to examine COVID-19 fatalities, we find that differences in
confirmed COVID-19 cases strongly predict the observed disparities, in fact entirely eliminating
4

the entire association for proportion Hispanic and the majority of the association for proportion
black.
The remainder of the paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 examines the rapidly
evolving COVID-19 literature with respect to disparities due to race and ethnicity. Section 3
discusses our data collection effort. Section 4 provides an empirical model and findings, and
Section 5 concludes.

2. Literature Review
Despite growing recognition about racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19, our study
is, to our knowledge, the first to systematically investigate their size and possible explanations
at a geographic level narrower than the county. Below we summarize the literature on racial
disparities pertaining to COVID-19 infections, testing, and deaths, with the caveat that the
literature is rapidly evolving. We then discuss, based on previous work, limitations on countylevel analyses and underlying mechanisms through which disparities could occur.
Nationwide, County-Level Analyses
Several recent studies utilize data on COVID-19 outcomes from U.S. counties and
analyze racial and ethnic disparities. McLaren (2020) collects county-level data on COVID-19
mortality from the entire U.S. and links to county characteristics from the American Community
Survey (ACS). By May 19, 2020, the unadjusted disparity shows a 10 percentage point increase
in the black share corresponding to an increase of 37.6 additional fatalities per million, with a
10 percentage point increase in the Hispanic share associated with 9.6 additional fatalities.

5

With additional controls – especially for public transit – the disparities decrease and in some
cases become insignificant (suggesting potential mechanisms for the observed disparity). The
study concludes that the disparity for blacks is very robust to the inclusion of additional
covariates, although the one for Hispanics is more fragile.
Knittel and Ozaltun (2020) also examine COVID-19 death rates at the county-level and
find mixed evidence of disparities. As of May 27, 2020, in a model with detailed controls but
excluding state fixed effects, a 10 percentage point increase in the proportion black is
associated with a large and statistically significant increase of 126.2 deaths per million
residents. With state fixed effects included, the estimated disparity shrinks to a still sizeable
46.8 deaths per million but becomes statistically insignificant. The disparity for proportion
Hispanic is not statistically significant in either model and the magnitudes are much smaller:
18.8 and 9.6 deaths per million in regressions without and with state fixed effects, respectively.
Desmet and Wacziarg (2020) examine both confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities.
Outcomes are measured as logarithm of cases or fatalities (plus one) for May 26, 2020, where
logarithm of population is included as a control, implying the other estimates can be
interpreted as the determinants of cases and deaths in per capita terms. They find highly
significant and virtually identical disparities in cases and fatalities for proportion black and
somewhat smaller standardized coefficients for proportion Hispanic.
Racial Segregation within U.S. Counties
There is somewhat limited racial and ethnic variation across counties in the U.S.,
although the share of minority-majority counties has been increasing since 2000 (Krogstad

6

2019). Fewer than 5 percent of all U.S. counties (151 out of 3,143) have either black, Hispanic,
or indigenous people as the majority. As of 2018, there were 72 majority-black counties,
primarily located in the southeastern U.S.; there were 69 counties where Hispanics are the
majority, predominantly in the southwestern U.S. (Schaeffer 2019). Especially in large U.S.
counties, there can be significant residential segregation, which may hide racial disparities in
COVID-19 that can be more precisely measured at a more localized level. This limitation is wellunderstood; for example, McLaren (2020) notes “much of the relevant variation exists at the zip
code level.” On a national level, there are 658 counties that contain 10 or more residential ZIP
codes entirely within the county. 1 More than one-third of these counties have large dispersion
– 25 percentage points or more – in the share black or Hispanic between the ZIP codes with the
highest and lowest shares.
Neither the southeast or southwest regions were the initial hotspots for COVID-19
spread, raising the question of whether observed correlations between county racial
composition and COVID-19 death rates are confounded by the staggered timing in which the
disease reached different parts of the country. The sensitivity of the results of Knittel and
Ozaltun (2020) to the inclusion of state fixed effects is suggestive of such confounding. Yet
including state fixed effects in county-level disparities regressions could itself be problematic,
as it controls away much of the identifying variation, reducing the precision of the estimates.
Accordingly, their coefficient for proportion black becomes statistically insignificant after
including state fixed effects despite remaining sizeable at 46.8 deaths per million. Estimating

racial disparities with both credibility and precision therefore appears to require data with
finer-grained geographic detail.
In our analysis of six cities, nearly 31% of ZIP codes we analyze were minority-majority
“neighborhoods” (to borrow the terminology of Almagro and Orane-Hutchinson (2020), who
refer to ZIP codes within New York City as neighborhoods). While analyses at even a more finely
grained level than ZIP code (e.g. Census tract) would be more desirable, ZIP codes offer much
more heterogeneity with respect to race and ethnicity than counties, while also having
satisfactory indicators related to long-run economic opportunity, human mobility, and other
key demographic and health-related information.
Potential Explanations and Related Evidence
Several factors may explain racial and ethnic disparities in the spread of COVID-19 and
subsequent COVID-19 outcomes. We next explain these theories and associated empirical
evidence. Many of the relevant studies examine New York City in isolation, since it was initially
the hardest hit in the U.S., and because of its relatively early posting of ZIP code level data. Of
course, New York City differs from the rest of the U.S. in many respects, even relative to other
large cities, so the extent to which these findings are generalizable is unclear.
One possibility may be the nature of jobs. Many features about occupations,
commuting, and the workplace could contribute to the spread of COVID-19, and may
disproportionately affect people of color. Almagro and Orane-Hutchinson (2020) argue that
occupation is a key explanatory variable for understanding the early transmission of COVID-19
in New York City, and since minority workers are more likely than others to be front-line

8

employees or unable to work from home, they are more likely to be working outside the home
during those hours. Accordingly, Coven and Gupta (2020) find that black and Hispanic
neighborhoods (measured at the ZIP code level) in New York City exhibited more daytime work
activity than other neighborhoods during the pandemic using mobile location data sourced
from VenPath. Another phenomenon observed in New York City during the early stages of the
pandemic was temporary relocation outside the city. Ability to relocate depends on whether
one’s job can be done remotely and also whether one has the financial resources to do so.
Perhaps for these reasons, Coven and Gupta (2020) find that the propensity to leave the city
was strongly negatively associated with the proportion black in the Census tract.
Health care access may also be an important factor, and the barriers to receiving COVID19 testing at the onset of the pandemic are well known. However, Schmitt-Grohé et al. (2020)
found that testing services were evenly shared across the income distribution in New York
City’s 177 ZIP codes. Borjas (2020) finds access to testing was roughly uniform across the share
of the ZIP code that was minority, but the conditional probability of a positive test result was
far greater in neighborhoods with larger Black populations.
It is also possible that residential segregation as measured at the ZIP code level, and the
consequences from it, led to long-lasting effects on health that made minority communities
particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Link and Phelan (1995) argue that social factors are a
fundamental cause of disease that, because they embody access to important resources, affect
multiple disease outcomes through multiple mechanisms, and consequently maintain an
association with disease even when intervening mechanisms change. Phelan and Link (2015)
argue that racial inequalities in health endure primarily because racism is a fundamental cause
9

of racial differences in socioeconomic status, and in turn socioeconomic status is a fundamental
cause of health inequalities. Chetty et al. (2019) find black Americans have much lower rates of
upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to persistent
disparities across generations. The black-white gap persists even among boys who grow up in
the same neighborhood. Logan and Parman (2018) demonstrate that premature mortality
among blacks is rooted in historical segregation. Using person-level data, the authors apply a
comprehensive measure of segregation extending the analysis of structural factors in racial
health disparities. Wiemers et al. (2020) highlight disparities in potential COVID-19
complications by constructing a vulnerability index from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics,
finding that blacks are drastically more vulnerable than other groups among people aged 45
and older. National estimates find that COVID-19 related hospitalizations among blacks and
Hispanics are more than 4 times that of whites (CDC 2020b). Price-Haywood et al. (2020) found
that more than 70 percent of patients who were hospitalized or died of COVID-19 were black,
compared to an overall population representation of 31 percent.

3. Data
To analyze racial and ethnic disparities, we combine ZIP code level data on COVID-19
outcomes from state and local government websites with data from (1) the 2018 ACS 5-year
sample, (2) the 2010 Census, (3) the Opportunity Atlas, (4) SafeGraph mobility data, (5) health
professional shortage areas published by the Health Resources & Services Administration, and
(6) conditional life expectancy published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

COVID-19 Data
From state and local websites, we gathered COVID-19 data at the ZIP code level for six
metropolitan areas: New York City, Chicago, Atlanta, San Diego, St. Louis, and Baltimore.2 The
ZIP codes include both the city proper, and in some cases the surrounding county. Crosssectional data was gathered from June 6, 2020 to June 9, 2020 for these localities. Once merged
with all other sources, the full analysis uses 436 ZIP codes, with 177 in New York City, 58 in
Chicago, 49 in Atlanta, 95 in San Diego, 21 in St. Louis, and 36 in Baltimore. Overall, there are
approximately 17.7 million people living in these ZIP codes, with nearly half residing in New
York City.
Our primarily outcome variable is confirmed COVID-19 cases per capita. Although
serological surveys provide strong evidence that confirmed cases are an undercount of total
infections, confirmed case numbers still have clear clinical and economic significance.
Nationally, the fatality and hospitalization rates for confirmed cases were roughly 5% and 10%,
respectively, by June 2020. 3 Even after discharge from a hospital, persistent symptoms may
remain (Carfì et al. 2020). In addition, confirmed infections (which tend to be more severe that
those that remain undetected) undoubtedly lead to lost earnings, family strain, psychological
distress, and potentially harmful long-term consequences (Eisenberg et al. Forthcoming).

The ZIP code data encompasses different geographies, based on what data was available. For New York City,
there were initially 177 ZIP codes across all five boroughs. For Chicago, there were initially 60 ZIP codes for the city
proper but our analysis does not include other parts of Cook County or DuPage County. For Atlanta, there were
initially 59 ZIP codes within Fulton County. For San Diego, there were initially 100 ZIP codes within San Diego
county. For St. Louis, there were initially 22 ZIP for the St. Louis City (and does not include St. Louis County). For
Baltimore, there were initially 40 ZIP codes covering the city including parts of Baltimore City County, Baltimore
County, and Anne Arundel County.

All six localities provided counts of COVID-19 cases, which are scaled into counts per
10,000 population. When weighted by population, Table 1 shows the median ZIP code had 143
cumulative cases per 10,000 population by early June, translating into a cumulative measured
infection rate of about 1.4%. Measured infection rates varied substantially, with 12 cases per
10,000 (0.1%) in the lowest decile and 315 cases per 10,000 (3.2%) in the highest decile. In the
aggregate, New York City had the highest rate of confirmed cases (2.3%), followed by Chicago
(1.7%) and Baltimore (0.9%). The other three localities had confirmed case rates varying from
0.26% to 0.48%. In the aggregate, there were more than 271,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in
these 6 cities, approximately 14% of all cases nationally by that point.4
We also conduct auxiliary analyses using a subsample of only Chicago and New York
City, cities that provide additional data that allow us to investigate two important questions.
First, do observed disparities in confirmed COVID-19 cases accurately reflect disparities in
illnesses, or are they confounded by geographic variation in availability of tests and criteria for
obtaining them? Note that we will include city fixed effects in all our models, which alleviates
this concern to some extent. Nonetheless, since Chicago and New York City report tests run by
ZIP code, they enable us to control for testing more directly. Second, are racial and ethnic
disparities in COVID-19 fatalities the result of a higher likelihood of catching the virus, a greater
risk of dying conditional on catching it, or some combination of both? Answering this question
requires data on COVID-19 fatalities – not just cases – and Chicago and New York City are the
only cities in our sample that report deaths by ZIP code. The bottom panel of Table 1 shows

4

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html

12

data for those two cities (and 235 ZIP codes). In these cities, the cumulative fatality rate from
COVID-19 was 0.17% by early June.
Census Bureau Data
We merged this information to the 2018 ACS 5-year sample, as well as to the 2010
Decennial Census using Social Explorer (which provides summary statistics at the ZIP code
level). The ACS contains a rich set of variables on demographics, economic outcomes, and
housing characteristics. Demographic variables include percent male, percent foreign born, and
percent aged 18-44, 45-64, 65-74, and 75+ (children under 18 are omitted). Housing variables
include density, percent renters, percent vacant units, percent overcrowded (1.5 or more
persons per bedroom), and percent of units with 0 or 1 bedrooms. The 2010 Census – although
dated – provides information about group quarters, specifically percent of population in nursing
homes, correctional facilities, college dormitories, and military barracks. Returning to the ACS
5-year sample, our socioeconomic variables include percent in education bins (dropout, high
school, some college, bachelor’s degree, the group beyond a bachelor’s degree is omitted as a
reference category), the Gini coefficient, and percent in poverty bins (0-49% FPL, 50-74%, 7599%, 100-149%, 150-199%, 200%+ is omitted). Occupation variables include percent of workers
in service occupations, sales, farming, construction, production, or transport (managerial
occupations omitted). Transportation variables include percent of workers of workers who use
a car, percent who use public transportation, and percent with long commuting times (60+
minutes). Finally, one of our measures of health access – percent without health insurance –
comes from the ACS.

13

Opportunity Atlas Data
The Opportunity Atlas is a collaboration of the Census Bureau, Harvard University, and
Brown University that uses anonymous data following 20 million Americans from childhood to
their mid-30s, with many outcomes measured at the Census tract level (which we aggregate up
to ZIP code). As noted by Chetty et al. (2018), neighborhoods matter at a very granular level,
where neighborhoods even one mile away have very little predictive power for child outcomes.
We focus on two key variables, which represent long-run opportunity. The first is average
annual household income ranking in 2014-2015 for children (in their mid-30s) who grew up in
the area, based on having a low-income parent (25th percentile). The second is fraction of male
children who grew up in the area who were in prison or jail on April 1, 2010. We aggregate
Census tracts to the ZIP code level using a crosswalk provided by the Missouri Census Data
Center. We follow the spirit of Courtemanche et al. (2017) by assigning Census tract to the ZIP
code where the plurality of residents live. In practice, approximately 53% of tracts nationally
map into one ZIP code only, and roughly 75% of tracts have at least eighty percent of their
population in one ZIP code.
SafeGraph Data
Many recent COVID-19 studies examine mobility using data from SafeGraph, which
provides access to their data through free, non-commercial agreements. Following Gupta et al.
(2020), we compute the fraction of cell phone devices that were detected to be entirely at
home during the day, aggregating from the Census Block Group level to the ZIP code level. We
aggregate Census Block Groups to ZIP codes using a crosswalk provided by the Missouri Census

14

Data Center. We computed daily averages for each ZIP code, and then averaged across all days
for the months of March 2020, April 2020, and May 2020. Again, following Courtemanche et al.
(2017), we assign Census block groups to the ZIP code where the plurality of residents live. In
practice, approximately 73% of block groups nationally map into one ZIP code only, and roughly
85% of tracts have at least eighty percent of their population in one ZIP code.
Health Professional Shortage Area Data
We incorporate information on each ZIP code’s status as being designated as a health
professional shortage area (HPSA) for federal fiscal year 2020. HPSAs are designated by the
Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to signify areas as medically underserved.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provide HPSA designation status at the
ZIP code level to signal to eligible health care professionals (e.g. physicians) if the location
where they practice medical care is eligible for enhanced Medicare reimbursements per the
2005 Medicare Modernization Act (CMS 2020). This feature of the program creates a financial
incentive for delivering care in medically underserved settings with historically higher uninsured
rates and limited access to care. We use this as a proxy measure to capture differences in
access to primary care and mental health services. HPSAs can be entire counties, but are most
commonly smaller portions of a county—this is particularly the case in larger cities.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Data
Our population health variables are conditional life expectancies obtained from the U.S.
Small-area Life Expectancy Estimates Project (USALEEP). The files contain conditional life
expectancies for different age bins at the Census tract level; in our model, we include
15

conditional life expectancies for ages 65-74, 75-84, and 85 plus, and aggregate from the tract
level to ZIP code. Many commentators attribute disparities in COVID-19 cases and deaths to
underlying health conditions such as elevated rates of chronic illnesses among blacks and
Hispanics (Artiga et al. 2020). We use variation in life expectancy – and focus on the elderly who
are most vulnerable to COVID-19 – to control for variation in underlying health status as well as
the risk factors leading to differences in preventable mortality.
Table 2 shows, along some margins, large differences in neighborhood characteristics
depending on racial and ethnic composition. Out of the 436 ZIP codes, 188 are majority white,
84 are majority black, 49 are majority Hispanic, and 115 are none of these. With respect to
demographics, Hispanic neighborhoods have much higher representation of foreign-born
individuals. With respect to housing, there are more renters in majority-black and majorityHispanic neighborhoods. Lower educational attainment and higher poverty levels are also
common attributes of these neighborhoods, as are lower levels of income mobility — an
indicator of long-run opportunity. At least some types of workers whose jobs do not easily
transfer online – those in service occupations – are more prevalent in predominantly black and
Hispanic neighborhoods. Also common in predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods are
larger dependence on public transit as a key mode of transportation (McLaren 2020) and longer
commuting times. Cell phone mobility measures are relatively similar, on average, across
neighborhoods. Health care access is worse for black and Hispanic neighborhoods according to
both percent uninsured and mental health HPSA, while population health — proxied by
conditional life expectancy — is fairly similar across neighborhood types, especially from age 75
onward. Finally, racial composition and segregation varies by city. None of the ZIP codes in San
16

Diego are majority Black, while Atlanta, Baltimore, and St. Louis have no ZIP codes that are
majority Hispanic.
4. Empirical Model and Findings
Model
We estimate linear models of the following form:
𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑧𝑧,𝑗𝑗 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃_𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑧𝑧,𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃_𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑧𝑧,𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑧𝑧,𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝑋𝑋𝑧𝑧,𝑗𝑗 + 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑧𝑧,𝑗𝑗

(1)

where 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑧𝑧,𝑗𝑗 represents either confirmed COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population or COVID-19
fatalities per 1,000,000 population in ZIP code z in city j. The key explanatory variables include
the percentage black and percentage Hispanic in each ZIP code (we also include percentage
Other race, with percentage white omitted). 5 We successively include additional neighborhood
characteristics in 𝑋𝑋𝑧𝑧,𝑗𝑗 . City fixed effects are given by 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 and 𝜀𝜀𝑧𝑧,𝑗𝑗 is the error term. All
observations are weighted by population in the ZIP code. Standard errors are

heteroscedasticity-robust. 6 Including city fixed effects controls for several important factors
that do not vary within city, including the arrival of the virus, weather patterns, lockdown
policies, and to some extent, the general availability of testing.

In the subsequent tables, we focus attention on percent black and percent Hispanic. The Other race category
includes several groups, some of which are not traditionally disadvantaged. Appendix Table 1 shows all the
coefficients from our base model and full model.
6
We also ran regressions clustering the standard errors at the city level, and this made the standard errors
implausibly small in some cases. Since the number of clusters (6) is too small for cluster-robust inference to be
reliable, we err on the side of caution and report the (larger) standard errors obtained without clustering. Also
note that, since we do not include any city-level variables, there is no particular reason to think that standard
errors obtained without clustering are systematically flawed (Cameron, Miller 2015).

17

Any interpretation in an observational analysis like this identifies correlations, not
causation (Knittel, Ozaltun 2020). With many observable neighborhood differences – including
some characteristics that intuitively might represent greater likelihood of COVID-19
transmission such as density, occupations, modes of transport, or health care access – it may be
tempting to attach causal stories. Our principal goal, however, is to assess the extent to which
such measured characteristics can explain the disparities, and the extent to which disparities
remain unexplained by conventional measures. Many neighborhood characteristics are likely
correlated with race or ethnicity, and based on previous research, contribute to the spread of
disease.
Size of Disparities
Our primary results are presented in Table 3, which examines confirmed COVID-19
infections per 10,000 population. In the top panel, we examine 436 ZIP codes across the 6
cities, and successively include covariates for demographics, housing, socioeconomic status,
opportunity, occupation, transportation, human mobility, health access, and population health.
The base model in column (1) – which only includes the race/ethnicity variables, city fixed
effects and a constant term – shows large, highly significant health disparities for both blacks
and Hispanics. A 10 percentage point increase in a ZIP code’s black share is associated with to
9.2 additional confirmed COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population, while a similar change in the
Hispanic share is associated with 20.6 additional COVID-19 cases. Both are very sizable changes
relative to the average confirmed cases rate of 153 per 10,000 population. Across the
remaining columns, the measured disparity remains sizable and significant, regardless of the set
of controls that are included. The full model in column (10) shows disparities that are roughly
18

60 percent as large as in column (1). Thus, a key insight is that even with an extensive set of
controls for factors that should plausibly affect the transmission of the virus, more than half of
the overall disparity in confirmed COVID-19 cases remains unexplained.
In the bottom panel, we focus on the 235 ZIP codes in Chicago and New York, since
those localities provide additional data on COVID-19. The initial overall disparities in column (1)
are larger, and a 10 percentage point increase in a ZIP code’s black share is associated with 12.4
additional confirmed COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population, while a similar change in the
Hispanic share is associated with to 24.8 additional COVID-19 cases. Again, both are sizable
changes relative to the average confirmed cases rate of 219 per 10,000 population for these
two cities. As neighborhood characteristics are added in the remaining columns, in some
instances the disparity falls and in others it rises. With the full set of controls in column (10),
there remain sizable disparities for both blacks and Hispanics, and again more than half of the
overall disparity remains unexplained. It should be noted that the “health access” variables in
column (9) now include COVID-19 tests per capita at the ZIP code level.
Next, we turn to Table 4, where we examine COVID-19 fatalities at the ZIP code level for
Chicago and New York, an outcome that was a key focus in McLaren (2020) and Knittel and
Ozaltun (2020). To maintain comparability, we scale COVID-19 fatalities per million population.
In column (1), we estimate models with race / ethnicity controls, city fixed effects and a
constant term, finding large and statistically significant disparities. A 10 percentage point
increase in the black (Hispanic) share is associated with to 143 (149) additional fatalities per
million, from a baseline of 1,727 per million in these two cities. In column (2), we include as an
additional control COVID-19 cases (per 10,000) in each ZIP code. Thus, we ask the extent to
19

which variation in fatalities is simply explained by greater numbers of confirmed COVID-19
cases, versus the extent to which factors beyond additional cases matter. The results show that
the coefficients fall by 50-100%, suggesting that racial and ethnic disparities in the spread of
infection is an extremely important determinant for resultant fatalities. For proportion
Hispanic, the coefficient estimate is very close to zero, while for proportion black, the
coefficient estimate is about half as large. In columns (3) and onward, additional covariates
similar to the ones in the bottom panel of Table 3 are added. With sufficient controls, the
original racial and ethnic disparities become insignificant.
Mechanisms
In a highly cited paper, Gelbach (2016) shows that the sequence in which covariates are
entered into the model can lead to very different conclusions about their relative importance.
In our context, the extent to which different sets of neighborhood characteristics “explain” the
observed racial and ethnic disparities may be sensitive to the sequence in which they are
entered into the model. For example, the changes in racial and ethnic disparities from adding
demographic covariates may have been different than those shown in Tables 3 and 4 if we had
added housing variables first, since demographic and housing variables are correlated. In order
to create a path-independent explanation of the influence of each set of neighborhood
characteristics, Gelbach prescribes omitted variable bias equations. Essentially, we estimate
omitted variable bias on the coefficient of interest from the exclusion of each sets of
neighborhood controls one at a time from the full model (in Table 3, column 10). The influence
of each set of neighborhood characteristics therefore becomes a function of the correlation

20

between the covariate and race / ethnicity in addition to the covariate’s coefficient in the full
specification.
Table 5 shows the results of the Gelbach decomposition for our full set of 6 cities on
COVID-19 cases (Table 3, top panel), as well for the 2 cities on cases and fatalities (Table 3,
bottom panel; Table 4). 7 The baseline coefficient comes from the model that only includes
racial / ethnic composition, city fixed effects, and a constant term. The “explained difference” is
the reduction that occurs from moving from the first column to the last column (e.g., from 0.92
to 0.59 for “% Black” in the top panel of Table 3), and the remaining rows show the contribution
of each set of neighborhood characteristics to the explained reduction (as well as their
statistical significance). In the model of COVID-19 cases with all 6 cities in column (1), much of
the explained difference in the disparity for blacks can be attributed to the long run opportunity
variables (income mobility and male incarceration rates for those born between 1978 and
1983). Although other sets of neighborhood characteristics occasionally have large magnitudes
(e.g., the occupation controls), they are not statistically significant. For the Hispanic disparity,
the opportunity variables again contribute to part of the explained difference; however,
demographics (which includes the fraction foreign born) and human mobility (from SafeGraph)
are larger factors.
The findings, when restricted to Chicago and New York, are somewhat different in for
cases and fatalities (columns 2 and 3 of Table 5, respectively). For confirmed COVID-19 cases,
the combined addition of all the covariates does little to change the estimate for proportion

This was implemented with the “b1x2” command in Stata.

21

black; however, several factors offset each other to result in essentially the zero change.
Controlling for health care access and human mobility is associated with statistically significant
reductions in the disparity, but this is offset by statistically significant increases in the disparity
from housing and socioeconomic characteristics and insignificant but similarly sized increases
from occupation and transportation. For proportion Hispanic, the key driver explaining much of
the reduction in confirmed cases appears to be health care access, which in the context of the
two cities includes COVID-19 tests per capita.8
Finally, for COVID-19 fatalities (column 3 of Table5), adding covariates from the base
model to the full model entirely explains the disparities for proportion black and Hispanic. The
most important factor in explaining COVID-19 fatalities is simply the rate of infection.
Differences in confirmed cases explain approximately two-thirds of the disparity in fatalities for
blacks, and the entire disparity for Hispanics. Other factors appear to have large and somewhat
offsetting effects for both groups (e.g., socioeconomic controls and occupational controls), but
a key implication is that understanding the core causes of COVID-19 cases can potentially
explain the alarming subsequent differences in mortality.
Robustness Checks
We explore several robustness checks in Tables 6 and 7. As illustrated in Table 2, one
key advantage of analyzing ZIP codes rather than counties is that residential segregation is
much more stark. Overall, 327 of the 436 ZIP codes are highly segregated, and we re-estimate
the models of COVID-19 cases restricted to neighborhoods that are the majority of one race or
Appendix Table 1 shows that among health access variables for New York and Chicago, tests per capita is highly
significant for confirmed cases.

ethnicity in Table 6. Overall, the findings – both from the base model and full model – are very
similar to Table 3. Next, our sample obviously differs from other county-level studies in that we
include a small number of cities with far less aggregated data. We test the sensitivity of the
results to excluding one city at a time in Table 7, presenting findings from the base specification
and full specification. In all cases, there are sizable racial and ethnic disparities in the base
specification. The findings on Hispanic disparities are robust across all specifications; there are
large disparities that are partially explained by neighborhood characteristics. For proportion
black, the baseline disparity was smaller than that for Hispanics, and the explained part was
modest as well in Table 3.

5. Conclusion
In this study, we use ZIP code level data to understand the factors contributing to racial and
ethnic disparities in COVID-19 burden. We find strong evidence that predominantly black and
Hispanic neighborhoods were disproportionately at risk to COVID-19 infections and mortality —
although the disparities were larger among Hispanic neighborhoods. Even though our study
was limited to six cities, these cities include the first (New York) and third (Chicago) largest in
the U.S., and case counts from these cities accounted for 14 percent of all confirmed U.S. cases
through June 9, 2020. The ZIP code level data allow us to examine a much wider range of
variation in racial and ethnic composition than other studies using county-level data, and we
also contribute to the literature by exploring numerous possible explanations for the disparities
using decomposition methods. Differences in social mobility, demographics, and long-run

23

opportunity arose as important contributors to COVID-related disparities. However, a
significant share of the disparity in cases for blacks and Hispanics remains unexplained despite
the inclusion of an exhaustive list of covariates. For fatalities, the majority of the disparities
appear to be driven by the differences in cases, as opposed to differential case fatality rates.
This is an important result, as it implies that interventions targeting reducing the spread of the
virus in minority communities might be a more effective use of scarce resources than those
targeting health care utilization once infected.
Our inability to explain most of the disparities in COVID-19 spread is perhaps surprising
since we control for the risk factors largely associated with social deprivation. Recent studies
have used area deprivation indexes (ADI) to explain disparities in avoidable hospitalizations and
readmissions (Kind, Buckingham 2018; Jencks et al. 2019; Hu et al. 2018) and difficulty
managing chronic illnesses (Kurani et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Camacho et al. 2017; Durfey et
al. 2019). ADIs are composite measures generally made up of weighted combinations of
education, labor market composition, income, income inequality, and housing market
information such as home ownership (Singh 2003). Rather than use an ADI, we allow for each of
our key covariates to enter into the regression separately, which is theoretically more flexible
and should allow for greater explanatory power.
With that said, if our lengthy list of explanatory variables does not explain the disparities
in COVID-19 cases, then what does? Are we not more successful in explaining the disparities
because we are considering the wrong theories, or because available data are inadequate to
fully test the existing theories? Structural racism may influence multiple mechanisms that are
difficult to quantify (Poteat et al. 2020; Braveman, Gottlieb 2014). For example, racial biases
24

could influence clinical decision making, which would not be captured by crude access
measures such as uninsured rates (Jones 2001). Obermeyer et al. (2019) found that several
clinical decision-support algorithms were less likely to refer black patients for advanced care
and screening than white patients presenting with identical symptoms. With respect to the
COVID pandemic, there are reports of blacks being denied screenings after seeking care for
COVID-19 symptoms at the early stages of this pandemic (Gathright 2020; Samuels 2020;
Shamus 2020; Patton 2020; Mitropoulos, Moseley 2020). Additionally, perhaps conditional life
expectancies are inadequate measures of underlying health risks. The premature deaths linked
to COVID-19 complications are associated with poorer underlying health status and whether
the person had a pre-existing condition such as diabetes, obesity, or hypertension, and we are
unable to measure those directly. 9 As another example, available socioeconomic information
may not truly capture the source of disadvantage; percent with a high school or college degree
says little about the quality of the schools attended, for instance.
To call the COVID-19 pandemic “the Great Equalizer” is a misnomer (Mein 2020; Kim et
al. 2020), and the pandemic’s key risk factors are unevenly distributed across communities.
Even though we are able to explain some of the racial and ethnic disparities as attributable to
different concentrations of socioeconomic risk factors, the fact that most of the case disparities
remains unexplained demonstrates the difficulty of addressing deeply embedded racial and
ethnic inequalities in health outcomes. Although more study is needed, our results suggest that

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has several state and national level tools to monitor chronic
diseases such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS), but the only publicly available resource at the county-level we are aware of is the U.S. Diabetes Surveillance
System, and we are not aware of any at a narrower level than county.

25

policies enacted to curb COVID-19’s spread should consider how they would overcome the
structural barriers to improvement across different groups. More superficial interventions such
as economic stimulus or expanding health insurance coverage are unlikely to be fully adequate.

Notes: All specifications include city fixed effects, “% Other non-white”, and a constant term. Unit of observation is ZIP code. Demographic variables include percentage in ZIP
code who are male, foreign born, or in age bins (18-44, 45-64, 65-74, 75+). Housing variables include density, percentage who are renters, percent of units vacant, percentage
who are in nursing homes, correctional facilities, college dorms, or military barracks (2010 Census), percent overcrowded (1.5+ per room), and percent with 0 or 1 bedroom
sizes. Socioeconomic variables include percent in education bins (dropout, high school, some college, bachelor’s degree), Gini coefficient, percent in poverty bins (0-49% FPL,
50-74%, 75-99%, 100-149%, 150-199%). Opportunity Atlas variables include income mobility and male incarceration (Opportunity Atlas). Occupation variables include percent
of workers in service occupations, sales, farming, construction, production, or transport. Transportation variables include percent of workers of workers who use a car,
percent who use public transportation, and percent with long commuting times (60+ minutes). Safegraph variables include percent who on average remained at home all day
in each month from March-May 2020 (Safegraph). Health access variables include health professional shortage areas (HRSA; mental health, primary care), percent without
health insurance, and COVID-19 tests per capita (Chicago and New York City only). Population health variables include conditional life expectancy (CDC, ages 65-74, 75-84,
85+). All control variables obtained from 2018 ACS 5-year sample unless otherwise indicated. All regressions weighted by ZIP code population from 2018 ACS 5-year sample.
