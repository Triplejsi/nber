THE EFFECT OF MULTINATIONAL FIRMS' FOREIGN OPERATIONS
ON THEIR DOMESTIC EMPLOYMENT

ABSTRACT

Given the level of its production in the U.S., a firm that produces more
abroad tends to have fewer employees in the U.S. and to pay slightly higher
salaries and wages to them. The most likely explanation seems to be that the
larger a firm's foreign production, the greater its ability to allocate the

more labor-intensive and less skill-intensive portions of its activity to
locations outside the United States. This relationship is stronger among manu-

facturing firms than among service industry firms, probably because services
are less tradable than manufactured goods or components, and service
industries may therefore be less able to break up the production process to
take advantage of differences in factor prices.

The Effect of Multinational Firms' Foreign Operations
on Their Domestic Employment

Irving B. Kravis

Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of foreign direct
investment (FDI) on the size and skill levels of the domestic employment of

U.S. parent companies. We are particularly concerned with the service industries, but we investigate manufacturing industries as well to determine
whether these effects differ between manufacturing and service industries.
There are a number of ways in which U.S. FDI might be expected to affect

the level and/or the skill composition of U.S. employment. Two of them involve effects on trade. One channel that has been widely discussed is the
substitution of foreign affiliate production for U.S. exports. Another avenue
is the substitution of imports from affiliates for goods produced in the

U.S. Still another possibility is that even if there were no trade effects,
investment abroad substitutes for, or crowds out investment at home. This
might happen if the investible funds of a firm or of an industry were limited
and could be added to only at increasing cost.'
Even if there were no effect on the amount of production in the U.S., the
level of U.S. employment might be altered by the reallocation of various
stages or processes of production between U.S. parents and their foreign

affiliates. For example, if affiliate production were more labor intensive

suggested in Stevens and Lipsey (1988).

than parent production in the U.S. a reallocation of production could reduce

the level of U.S. employment.2 Similar effects could take place with respect
to skill intensity; that is, the allocation of low skill intensity production
to foreign operations could reduce the home demand for unskilled labor and
raise the average skill and average compensation level at home.

We deal only briefly with the effects of U.S. direct investment on U.S.

exports here because they have been studied extensively elsewhere. However,
we do extend the earlier work to cover the service sector. We have not
attempted to deal with effects of direct investment on U.S. imports because

the imports from affiliates are so small relative to U.S. production. The
crowding out effect on investment is studied in another paper (Stevens and

Lipsey, 1988). What we do concentrate on in this paper is the effects of U.S.
direct investment abroad on the labor intensity of U.S. production (employment
for a given level of output) and the skill intensity of U.S. production by the
investing firms.

The Data

In investigating these relationships we considered three indicators of

the multinationals' activity abroad: affiliate total assets; affiliate
property, plant, and equipment (PPE); and net sales (net of imports from

parents).3 The data relate to individual nonbank parents and their nonbank

For U.S. firms, see Courtney and Leipztger (1975) for both U.S. and Swedish
firms, see Lipsey, Kravis, and Roldan (1982), and for foreign firms in Brazil,
see Morley and Smith (1974).
The amount of direct foreign investment was not used as an indicator
because it has a number of disadvantages as a measure of foreign affiliate
activity. Among other objections, the assets included may not be in the same
location as the foreign affiliate, and assets financed by borrowed or equity
capital provided by others than the parent are excluded. For further
discussion of various indicators of the extent of direct investment abroad,
see Kravis and Lipsey (1988).

affiliates. They are from the mandatory reports of parents and affiliates in
the 1982 benchmark survey of U.S. direct investment abroad (U.S. Department of

Commerce, 1985) This source includes the activity variables for parents as
well as affiliates, and a wide variety of other balance sheet, income state-

ment, and operating variables. Variables from this source used here in
addition to the activity variables include parents' and affiliates' exports,
parents' imports from their affiliates, and the number of employees and their

compensation for both parents and affiliates. It was possible to analyze the
data for individual firms (parents and affiliates) despite government prohibitions against disclosure of individual reports through an arrangement in
which we specified regressions to be run or special tables to be prepared
which were then executed by the Department of Commerce.4
The industrial classification used in the report on the benchmark survey
(U.S. Department of Commerce, 1985) includes over 20 service (non—commodity

producing) industries. The main categories into which they fall are wholesale
trade; finance, insurance and real estate; and "services." "Services" includes "business services" such as advertising, and other services such as

hotels and health services. Here we use the term "nonbusiness services" to
cover the industries classified by Commerce under its "service" rubric but not

as "business services;" hotels and health services are examples. We also
include transportation and retail trade in the nonbusiness service category.

A criterion of confining the regressions to industries with at least 15
parents restricted the number of "basic" service industries (i.e., not further

subdivided in the Commerce classification) to four —

finance

(excluding bank-

ing), advertising, computer services, and engineering. In the tables which

follow, regressions are reported for these four industries, and for certain
-

aggregations of basic industries, such as business service industries. There
is also a set of regressions for all service industries which includes all the
industries already mentioned plus petroleum trade and oil field services.
It is widely recognized that the service industries are a heterogeneous
set of activities with wide variations in key industrial characteristics, such
as capital labor/ratios, wage levels and use of human capital, and technolog-

ical sophistication. The heterogeneity of the service sector, as compared
with the goods sector, and especially with manufacturing, is illustrated by
the following comparisons for two important industry characteristics (capital
per employee and compensation per employee):

The Commerce classification contains a larger number of detailed

("basic") industries in the goods sectors — more than 30 in manufacturing

alone — but since our main interest here is a comparison with the service
industries, we confine our presentation of regressions to the total for all
manufacturing and to each of the six major manufacturing sub—industries (food,
chemicals, metals, nonelectrical machinery, electrical machinery, and trans-

port equipment). Although manufacturing is included for comparative purposes,
there is, of course, an inherent interest in the results for this sector which

—5—

is often regarded as the archetypal industry for foreign investment. Actually, manufacturing affiliates accounted for 38% of all affiliate sales; petroleum, including petroleum services such as oil field services and petroleum
wholesale trade, 35%; and most of the rest are sales of service industries.

[11E1715 A distinction has to be made between majority—owned affiliates
(MAJs) and those in which parents owned a 50 percent or minority interest

(MINe). For all industries, MAJs accounted for 78% of affiliate sales (11E17,

111E17) and the MAJs share was the sa in all services (special tabulation).

Effect of foreign affiliate activity on U.S. employment
We turn our attention first to the reallocation hypothesis, examining the
relationships of U.S. employment by parent firms in each industry to the three
indicators of its foreign affiliate activity (total assets; property, plant,

and equipment (PPE); and net sales6). We include parent sales as an independent variable in all the regressions as a proxy for parent production to hold
constant the influence of the size of the parent firm.
There is a striking difference between service industries and manufacturing in the degree to which parent employment is related to the three

independent variables describing affiliate activity. In manufacturing, there
is only a small difference among the variables; they all, in combination with
parent sales, explain parent employment well, although affiliate net sales has

a slight edge. In services, however, outside of wholesale trade and finance,
where PPE explains employment best, the net sales variable explains parent

employment better than either of the other two variables. We therefore

on the net sales equations in the text, although all, three sets

are shown in the appendixes. (See Appendix Table 1.)
The relationship of parent employment to affiliate net sales in all
service industries combined (589 parents) is as follows:

(55.9)

Ps — .0096 MAJS
(10.9)

(6.5)

where PEM is parent employment; PS, parent sales, and KAJS and MINS are the
net sales (sales minus imports from the U.S.) of majority—owned and minority—

owned affiliates, respectively. (*Significant at the 1% level.)
Given the level of parent sales, including exports, a million dollar
increase in MAJ sales, reduces the number of parent jobs by 10. Iligher KIN

sales add to parent employment — about 20 jobs per million dollars of sales.
When results for individual service industries are examined (Table 1,
columns 2—5), the direction of the relationship between parent employment and
sales of majority—owned affiliates is negative somewhat more often than not,

although the relationship 1. significant in only half of the cases. Of those
coefficients that are significant at the 5Z level, four are negative and two

are positive. For sales by minority—owned affiliates, there is no predominance of plus or minus signs, and the one significant coefficient was nega-

tive. (See Table 1 and Appendix Table 2.) The positive relation of parent
employment to minority—owned affiliate sales found in the equation for all
service industries does not appear in any of the groups or individual service

industries we could examine separately. Thus, that positive association is
apparently an industry phenomenon and the causation may well run in the
opposite direction; industries with high employment/sales ratios at home were
the ones with relatively extensive involvement in minority ownership abroad.

(*Significant at the 1% level.)

As in the service industries, employment of parents in manufacturing industries, given their level of production, is negatively related to sales of
their majority owned affiliates, but the impact is smaller than in services.
A more substantial difference is that employment of manufacturing parents is

negatively correlated with sales of minority owned affiliates. While we
interpret the causation as running from the level of foreign production to
labor intensity in the U.S., the alternative interpretation is that, in
manufacturing, the less labor—intensive firma produce more abroad.
The significant MAJS

coefficients

are negative in 3 individual manufac-

turing industries and positive in only 1 (electrical machinery). (See Table 1
and Appendix Table 2.) The coefficients for MINS are also predominantly
negative but the only 2 significant coefficients are split. Nonelectrical
machinery is the industry with a positive (and significant) coefficient.
The generally negative associations between affiliate sales and parent
employment fit with a finding in earlier work (Kravis and Lipsey, 1982) that
manufacturing firms produce in a more labor—intensive manner abroad than in
the U.S. and in a more labor—intensive manner the lower the cost of labor in a

country. As was pointed out in that paper, this response to differences in
the price of labor could occur in at least two ways. The multinational firm
could produce the same goods in low—wage countries as in high—wage countries,

but in a more labor—intensive manner. For example, Chevrolets produced in

—8—

Africa might be polished and finished in a mach more labor—intensive way than

those assembled in the U.S. That is the standard case of locating production
at different points along a single isoquant in response to different prices of

labor (Figure 1.)

The other way the multinational first might respond would

be to allocate its production of capital—intensive goods for the world market
to its high wage locations and its production of labor—intensive goods to its

low—wage locations. For example, the semiconductor industry could locate its
capital—intensive or technology—intensive wafer production to the U.S. and its
labor—intensive assembly operations to Malaysia (Figure 2.)

In the former case, assuming that cars sold in Africa had to be assembled
in Africa, the existence of the African assembly operation or its size should

have no effect on the input of labor per unit of U.S. production. In the
second case, however, a firm with extensive assembly operations overseas would
be substituting labor—intensive production in Malaysia for labor—intensive

production in the U.S. The finding here that larger foreign operations are
associated with lower parent employment suggests the latter explanation.
Another possibility is that the less labor—intensive firms in an industry, or perhaps the firms that are more efficient overall, tend to invest more
heavily in foreign production because they have the firm—specific assets that
encourage direct investment.

The inclusion of the parent sales variable in these regressions is in
tended as a way of holding constant, or removing the influence on parent

employment of, the size of the parent company's output. The assumption
involved is that sales are roughly proportional to output, particularly within

industries. Presumably, sales that do not come from the parents' output, such
as those of products imported from affiliates, are not large enough to disturb
this proportionality.

A closer approximation to parent output1 particularly for industries such
as motor vehicles in which imports from affiliates are important, would be

parent sales net of imports from affiliates. We can test for the significance
of such an adjustment by adding a variable for imports from affiliates to
equations I and 2, with the results as given in equations 3 and 4.

parent imports from all affiliates and the other terms are as previ-

ously defined. (*Significant at the 1Z level.)
The coefficients of PS, KAJS, and MINS do not change very much when H is
added (compare equations 3 and 4 with I and 2), but the i2 increase slightly.
In manufacturing as a whole, the coefficient for imports is of about the

same size as that for parent sales. That suggests that the import

variable

acts as a correction to parent sales, and that it would, therefore, be appropriate to use a single variable for parent sales net of imports from affili

ates. In services, however, where imports are ich less important than in
manufacturing, the import coefficient is much larger than that for parent
sales, an indication that the import variable represents some other phenomenon.
Equations for individual manufacturing industries (Appendix Table 3) show

only three significant coefficients for imports, all negative. The import
coefficient for the metals industry is similar to the parent sales coefficient

but those for chemicals and transport equipment are a.ch larger. A possible

—10—

interpretation is that

affiliates

parents in the metals industry are importing from the

goods of capital intensity similar to their home production while

those in chemicals and transport equipment are importing goods of lower cap-

ital intensity than their home production. If that were the case, it would be
in accord with the idea that firms tend to assign the least capital—intensive

production to their affiliates. It is puzzling, however, that in the electrical machinery and equipment industry, where this pattern has been documented,
we find no significant import coefficient.
The equations for individual service industries show no significant

coefficients for imports. That may be because imports are very small and
because the location of production and the meaning of exports and imports are

not easy to define in service industries. The fact that the import coefficient was negative and significant in the overall service equation, but not in
individual industry equations suggests that there may be some tendency for
imports to come from the more labor—intensive industries, even if

labor—intensive

not from

segments within individual service industries.

In general, the sales variables explain a large part of the variation in
employment among firms, but the formulation is a very simple one and a question may be raised about the robustness of the results were other explanatory

variables such as factor intensities and relative wages added.
We did not explore these poesibilities very extensively, but we did try
adding to the independent variables the ratio of affiliate to parent compen-

sation per employee. The theory behind this variable is that a low ratio of
affiliate to parent wage represents an ability to locate affiliate production

in low wage countries. A high ratio represents an inability to cake advantage
of low—wage locations. A high ratio should, therefore, be associated with low
ratios of parent imports to parent sales and therefore with high parent employment

In the corresponding equations for basic industries (see Appendix Table 4) the
coefficient of the new variable was positive whenever the t—ratio exceeded

1

(5 service and 2 manufacturing industries). However, both in the overall
equations and in the equations for the basic industries, the coefficients of

affiliate sales remained almost the same. In the overall equations:

Thus the contribution of the relative wage variable is limited to the hint
given (by its tendency toward positive coefficients) that a greater ability
of a firm or industry to shift production to low—wage countries, reduces
parent employment per unit of output, or, in other words, the labor intensity
of parent output.

—12—

Compensation Per Employee
Foreign activity of U.S. affiliates may affect U.S. labor not only
through direct impacts on the number of jobs but also by affecting the demands

for various types of labor. Given the lower wages for unskilled labor outside
the United States, it might be expected that firms that can allocate different

parts of their production to different host countries would place their most
skill—intensive production in the U.S. and their unskilled—labor intensive

production in their overseas affiliates. The effect of such an allocation of
production would presumably be to raise the demand for skilled labor and

reduce the demand for unskilled labor in the U.S. Even if no such skill—based
allocation of production were feasible, a growth of foreign activity might
tend to require increased supervisory input at home and therefore a shift in
demand toward high—paid personnel.

We test for the effect of foreign activity in two ways. One is to relate
the average compensation level of parents, which we take as representing the
average skill level, to measures of parent size and affiliate size,

distin-

guishing between majority—owned and minority—owned affiliates on the theory
that they may represent different strategies in the allocation of production

or perform different roles for the parents. The other is to relate average
parent compensation to the relative size of affiliate operations.
When parent compensation per employee is related to the sales of parents
and affiliates few statistically significant equations are obtained (See Table

1, columns 6—9). In the equations for all services none of the independent

variables has a significant coefficient. In the basic industries, even a
liberal definition (10 per cent) of significance for the equation as a whole
puts within the pale only wholesale trade in durables, "services" as a group,

nonbusiness services as a group, and transportation. In all of these cases,

—13--

all,

the affiliate coefficients with a t"statistic above one are positive,

suggesting a faintly perceptible positive relation of affiliate production to

parent average skill levels. Things look a little better

parent compensation per employee and the other variables have the

same definitions as in the previous equations. (*Significant at the IZ

level.)

In the manufacturing subindustries the equations meet the 10 percent
level of significance in 4 out of the 6 cases and here, too, all. the affiliate

coefficients with a t—statistic above 1 are positive.
Similar results were obtained from equations in which compensation per

employee was related to the ratio of affiliate to parent sales. (See Appendix

Table 5, column 4.) There were few significant coefficients for the independent variable (3 out of 11 in services, and 1 out of 6 in manufacturing),
but the signs were predominately positive (10 out of 11 and 5 out of 6).
While these results are weak, they do serve to confirm the earlier conclusion that manufacturing firms are more able to shift activities to locations with low—cost factors of production than are service firms.

In

this

case, it is cheap unskilled labor that attracts U.S. firms and causes them to
shift the operations intensive in low—skilled labor.

The effects of foreign operations on exports
We have,

up to this point, examined the effects of foreign production on

U.S. parent employment holding constant the level of parent sales. If foreign
production substituted for domestic production, it would affect the level of

—14—

domestic employment, but

that

impact would be obscured by the use of total

parent sales as an independent variable. We ignored this problem on the
ground that previous work8 has failed to uncover any substitution of foreign
production for exports but that work has been confined to manufacturing and it
is advisable to test those results and extend them to services.

Although exports are small relative to total sales in most industries (in
1982, 11% of sales of manufacturing parents and 6 percent for service industry
parents9) we would like to know whether foreign affiliate activity (net sales)
on balance is supportive of U.S. exports or substitutes for them.
The earlier results for manufacturing are confirmed and extended to
service industries by regressions using the benchmark Ff1 survey data to link
exports to foreign affiliate net sales:

The coefficient of MINS in the service Industry equation is negative but

It Is more than offset by the larger positive coefficient for MAJS. Even if
the IIINS coefficient were equal though opposite in sign from the MAJS

coef-

ficients, the overall effect of foreign affiliate net sales on parent exports

would be positive, since sales of majority owned affiliates are 3 to 4 times
as great as sales of minority owned affiliates.

In the basic service industries the MAJS coefficient is usually positive
and significant at the 5% level, while the MINS coefficient is significant

only in one industry — wholesale nondurables. (See Table 2.) It may be surmised that these affiliates are marketing U.S. goods while this is not so much

the case for affiliates of parents in other industries. With the exception of
advertising, for which affiliate sales are strongly negatively

correlated with

parent exports, the combined effect of sales of majorityowned and minority
owned affiliates is positive in the individual industries. t4uch the same
story emerges when factor intensities (parent wage as a skill proxy and
PPE/employment as a capital/labor ratio) are added to the sales variables as

independent variables. (See Appendix Table 6.) The MAJS coefficient is
positive and significant in 10 out of 12 cases and dominates the negative MINS

coefficient which appears in 5 cases (though only I is significant). Advertising again is the exception, having negative coefficients for both MAJS and
MINS.

tn the manufacturing equation, the coefficients of MAJS and MINS are both

positive, although only the latter is significant. In 4 of the 6 subindus
tries at least one of these coefficients is positive and significant and the

combined effect is positive (Table 2). The combined effect in one of the
other two, transportation equipment, is negative, but the negative MAJS coefficient is only a little greater than its standard error and the positive MINS

coefficient a little less than its standard error. This summary applies also
to the equations in which factor intensities are added (Appendix Table 6).
The upshot of this exploration of the relationship of affiliate production to parent exports is that in service industries, as in manufacturing,
affiliate production increases exports where it has any effect at all.

Conclusion
We find that, given the size of parent operations at home, a firm that
produces more abroad more often than not has fewer employees in the U.S. and

pays slightly higher average wages and salaries. Both of these relationships
are stronger among manufacturing firms than among service industry firms. We
think the most plausible explanation is that factor proportions in the parent
firm change as affiliate activity increases: the ratio of labor to capital
declines and the skilled or professional labor content of production rises.
This would be the case if multinational firms tended to place their more labor
intensive operations abroad, leaving the more capital intensive and skill
intensive ones for home production.
An alternative explanation might be that affiliate sales abroad displace

U.S. exports. However, as in earlier studies for manufacturing, we found that
net sales or production by foreign affiliates tends, if anything, to increase
parent exports, and that this is the case in both manufacturing and services.
An exception to the apparent negative effect of affiliate production on
parent employment is the fact that production by minority—owned manufacturing

affiliates seems to increase parent employment. We attribute this effect to
the strong positive effect of production by these affiliates on parent exports. That relation is also noted in Blonstroin, Lipsey, and Kulchycky
(1988), where it is described as suggesting that minority—owned affiliate
production is even more of a method of buying market share for the parent than
is majority—owned affiliate production.
Another possible explanation of the negative relationship between parent
employment and affiliate sales might be that the parents' capital/labor ratios
are not altered by affiliate activity but that inputs of both capital and

labor decline as foreign activity increases. This could happen only if larger

-17—

foreign operations made

greater

economies of scale available for the parent

firm's operations. A possible example would be the spreading of the output of
R&D or some types of central management input over a larger volume of production.

The conclusions that the production of U.S. parents is less labor intensive than it would be if there were less affiliate production, and that the
quality of the labor the parents employ is higher, do not apply to differences
among firms in all service or all manufacturing industries.

There is a great

deal of variation among the industries, and in many cases there is no visible

effect within detailed industries. We conclude that, especially in service
industries, the impact of foreign operations on domestic employment and skill
levels should not be a major consideration in assessing the desirability of
encouraging overseas production by U.S. firms.
