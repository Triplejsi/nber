DIFFERENCES IN INCOME ELASTICITIES AND TRENDS
IN REAL EXCHANCE RATES

ABSTRACT

One might expect that differences in income elasticities
differences

in trade and/or

in growth rates among countries would give rise to strong secular

trends in real exchange rates; for example, fast-growing countries might need
steady depreciation to get the world to accept their growing exports.
fact, however, income elasticities are systematically

In

related to growth rates

by the "45-degree rule", under which fast-growing countries appear to face
high income elasticities of demand for their exports, while having low income
elasticities of import demand.

The net effect of this relationship between

elasticities and growth rates is that secular trends in real exchsngerstes
are much smaller than one might otherwise have expected:
fairly well.

relative PPP holds

This paper documents the existence of a "45-degree rule", and

suggests an explanation

in terms of increasing returns and product differ-

entiation.

There may be something to this. In the 1950s and l960s, the
fast-growing country was Japan, while the slow growing countries
were the US and the UK. Japan was clearly playing catch-up with
the rest of the industrial world, which meant that it was becoming

that its growth would be biased toward the sectors in which it did

and could explain why Japan did not need declining terms of trade.

Second,

this story has an implication about the shares of trade in

income. Suppose that an economy grows, while the rest of the world
does not. If the growing economy is not to have a deterioration in
its terms of trade, it must have no increase in its import demand.

Hence the

must fall:

the

economy must become more closed over time. Admittedly this result
can be softened by making ceteris not paribus,
