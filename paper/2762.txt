Introduction
Recent research into the behavior of the stock market reports evidence

that returns are negatively serially correlated.

Poterba and Summers (1987)

find that variance ratio tests reject the hypothesis

that stock prices

follow a random walk, and Fama and French (1988) show that there is
significant autocorrelation

in long—horizon returns.1

It is well known

[see Leroy (1973), Lucas (1978), and Mlchener (1982)1 that serial
correlation

of returns does not in itself imply a violation of market

efficiency.2 Nevertheless,

there is a tendency to conclude that evidence of

mean reversion in stock prices constitutes a rejection of equilibrium models
of rational asset pricing.

Fama and French suggest this interpretation

as a

while Poterba and Summers argue that the serial

in returns should be attributed

to "price fads".

In this paper

we demonstrate that the empirically estimated serial correlation of stock
returns is consistent with an equilibrium model of asset pricing.

The method and organization of the paper is as follows.

2. Grossman and Shiller (1981) make this same point in showing that the
"excess" volatility implied by variance bounds tests can be partly explained
by risk aversion in a consumption beta model. More recently, Black (1988)
has discussed the relation between mean reversion and consumption smoothing.

This is done so that we can calibrate the asset pricing model by

setting the parameters of the exogenous forcing process equal to these
maximum likelihood estimates.

We are principally interested in two hypotheses.

The first is the random walk model of stock prices, which is an implication
of the Lucas model when agents have linear utility.

The second hypothesis

is that observed asset prices are determined in equilibrium but agents
attempt to smooth their consumption.

In this setting, asset returns can be

negatively serially correlated even though they rationally reflect market
fundamentals.

To summarize our results, we find, for all return horizons longer
than one year, that the variance ratio statistics and regression
coefficients

the Lucas Model.

Consider the economy studied by Lucas (1978) in which there are a

large number of infinitely lived and identical agents and a fixed number of
assets which exogenously produce units of the same nonstoreable consumption

Let there be K agents and N productive units.

The dividend data are annual observations from the Standatd and

Poors 500 index deflated by the CPI from 1871 to 1985.6

We use these data

as a benchmark because they represent the longest available time series, and
we believe that the characteristics of these data are representative of
equity returns and dividend disbursements in general.

Also, the Standard

and Poors 500 index is one of the data sets used by Poterba and Summers, so

a direct comparison can be made with some of their results.

We follow both

with and without this adjustment.

We find that the general pattern of the variance ratios calculated from the

The discrepancy at the first

horizon occurs because there is almost no first order serial correlation in
the annual returns data, while the equilibrium model produces some negative
first order serial correlation.

in the calculation of the variance ratio.

In every other case, however, the

small sample bias dominates at the longer horizon while consumption
smoothing

dominates at the short horizons.

5. Conclusion.

Is mean reversion in stock prices evidence of market inefficiency?
We investigate this question by asking whether the empirically observed time
series properties of stock returns can be generated by an equilibrium model
of asset pricing.

Monte Carlo distributions

of variance ratio statistics

and long horizon return regression coefficients are generated using
equilibrium returns derived from the Lucas (1978) model and a nonstationary
Markov process governing dividends, consumption, and GNP.

We conclude that

the equilibrium model cannot be rejected in the sense that the estimates of

serial correlation in stock returns using actual data could reasonably have
been drawn from our Monte Carlo distribution.

This result is stronger when

agents in the equilibrium model care about smoothing their consumption
paths.

In fact, if the coefficient of relative risk aversion is betveen 1.4

and 1.7, implying an intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption
is between

.58 and .71, the median of the simulated distributions

very well to the actual estimates.

Perhaps surprisingly,

conforms

a reasonably

elasticity of intertemporal substitution has substantive effects on the

high

—23—

serial correlation exhibited by simulated return series.

It does not take

much for the desire to smooth consumption to dominate any wealth effects
produced by changes in dividends and lead to mean reversion in asset prices.
Furthermore,

our results are robust to a variety of assumptions regarding

the properties of the exogenous

forcing variable.

We make two final points regarding our results.

The first concerns

the time series properties of the exogenous forcing variable.

We believe

that this process, whether it be dividends,

consumption, or GNP, is properly

modeled as a nonlinear

If we are correct, this induces

stochastic process.

the standard specification

error into computations that are based on

assuming that this time series is some sort of linear process.15

While this

error could lead an investigator to find either too much or too little

serial correlation, given the process which we estimate, it is more likely
the error will lead to too little.
The second point concerns small sample bias and the implications of
this bias for power in hypothesis

testing.

When computing statistics based

on returns at five or ten year horizons, 116 annual observations is very
little data. The bias is also seen to grow as the effective sample size gets
smaller.

The implication for testing the null against local alternatives

complementary

is

to Summer's (1986) point that most tests of market efficiency

have virtually no power against what he calls fad alternatives.

Since we

have shown that a properly constructed equilibrium model can generate
rational asset prices which exhibit a very wide range of time series

-24—

properties,

it follows that, given the available data, the test of any fad

model will have very little power against the rather wide class of
equilibrium alternatives.

More precise estimates and more powerful tests

can only come through the passage of time and not by sampling the data more
frequently.16

If there had been a well functioning asset market since the

time of the Norman invasion (1066 A.D.) and we had all the necessary price
and dividend data, then we might begin to distinguish among some of the
competing theories.

16. That is, in computing the autocorrelation of ten year returns, what is
needed is more ten year time periods and not weekly or daily observations.
All we can do is wait.
