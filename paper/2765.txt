These results are important for all those who use the IP or Y4 data.
This includes particularly researchers on inventories,

since some studies

use the IP measure while others use the Y4 measure.2 More generally, many
studies of the business cycle employ IF as a measure of economic activity.

II. Data Constructiom

In this section we describe how the data released by the relevant
government agencies are constructed, and how we use these data to construct
Y4.

A. Construction of IP
The Federal Reserve Board's (FRB) index of industrial production is
available monthly, both seasonally adjusted (SA) and seasonally unadjusted
2Blinder (1986) and West (1986) use the Y4 measure, while Maccini and
Miron and
Rossana (1984) and Reagan and Sheehan (1985) use the IF measure.
Zeldes (1988) report two sets of results: one using IF and the other using
Y4. West points out in his footnote 13 that he estimated his equations for
a few of the industries using the IP measure as well. He found that the
parameters were uniformly non-sensical and therefore did not report them.

(NSA), at the 2-digit level, from 1959 to the present.

The series sre

published in the Survey of Current Business and the Federal Reserve
Bulletin.

The 2-digit series and the more aggregated series are constructed

from disaggregated data using value-added weights.
The disaggregated IP indexes are constructed from three types of data:
physical product measures,

kilowatt-hours of electrical power input, and

man-hours of labor input.

Each of these is collected at either the

establishment (plant) level or at the more specific product level.

The

input measures are used in cases where the physical product numbers are not
available or would not make sense because of heterogeneity in the product.
For the physical product measures,

the FRB uses series from the Department

of Energy, the Bureau of the Census and other public and private sources.
Most of these are counts of output goods, although occasionally (e.g.,
steel) they are constructed as the sum of sales and inventory changes.3

For the kilowatt-hour data, the FRB asks utility companies their sales of
kilowatt hours of electric power to firms in manufacturing.4'5'6 For the
man-hours series, the Bureau of Labor Statistics provides data from its
3The physical product numbers are divided by the number of working
days in the reporting period in order to put each series on a per-workingday basis.
4unfortunately, the reports do not measure electricity use on a
calendar month basis, because billing dates fall throughout the month and
thus cover different month long periods for different customers (Federal
Reserve Board, 1986, p. 42).
5Monthly movements in the data are reviewed to eliminate "abrupt
movements that cannot be accounted for by such developments as work
stoppages, power shortages, or cyclical movements," and are presumed due to
inappropriate reports (FRB, 1986, p.42).
6The FRB also asks "self-generators" of electricity in the
manufacturing industry to report power used in manufacturing.

at the 2-digit level.

We adjust the finished goods and work in progress

inventory series from cost to market by multiplying each by an industryspecific constant,

as described in West (1983) and Holtz-Eakin and Blinder

(1983), respectively.

To arrive at the constant dollar inventory series, the BEA begins with
data on the book value of inventories collected by the Bureau of the Census
at the Commerce Department and adjusts these for differences between book
and current dollar values and also for differences between current and
constant dollar values.

This complicated procedure incorporates

information about whether firms use LIFD or non-LIFO accounting methods and
involves estimating the accounting age structure of the existing stock of
goods.

The conversion procedures are described in detail in Hinrichs and

Eckman (1981) and in Foss, et al.(l98D).

12

The book value data are collected by the Census through three surveys:
the monthly M3 (Manufacturers'

Shipments,

Inventories,

and Drders), the

12

The book value data measure the value of the goods currently in
inventory, at acquisition cost. For example, when prices are rising over
time, an item in inventory that is three years "old" in accounting terms
will have a lower book vslue than an identical item that is one year
"old," because it is on the books as having been acquired in different
years at different costs. The accounting age of goods in inventory very
much depends on the method of inventory accounting used.

When a firm uses LIFO accounting, positive changes in book value
These
inventory levels accurately measure current dollar increases.
changes are deflated into constant dollars, and then cumulated to get a
constant dollar stock. Negative changes in book value numbers imply that
goods from previous LIFO layers were sold, and an estimate must be made of
the acquisition date and cost.
When a firm uses non-LIFO accounting, the procedure is more
complicated. Even if the number of goods in inventory does not change in a
month, the book value of inventories may still change, because "old" lower
cost inventories were replaced on the books with "new" higher cost
inventories (again assuming prices are rising). The SEA must estimate the
entire age structure of inventories (based on turnover ratios), and then
the book value of the goods of each age must be divided by an estimate of
the acquisition cost of the goods of that age. See Foss, et al (1980, pp.
47-49).

of the twenty 2-digit industries examined here.15

The message conveyed is

that there is statistically significant seasonality in prices in most of
the industries considered here, but this seasonality is sufficiently small

relative to the seasonality in output that it is probably not an important
factor in the re-seasonalizationof the data.

III. The Time Series Properties of the Two Messures of Production
The description of the construction of the two series makes it clear

that they are unlikely to be numerically identical.

In this section, we

quantify the extent to which the series diverge and show that the
differences are significant.

also present results for seasonally unadjusted data, however, and we
examine the seasonal movements themselves.

variance bounds tests, the results presented below all focus on the
15The prices used do not correspond exactly to the SIC classification
for output, although the correspondence is close. The first two columns
report results of tests of the hypothesis of no seasonality, while the
third column reports the standard deviation of the estimated seasonal
coefficients. To calculate the test statistics, we regressed the log growth
rate of prices on a constant and eleven seasonal dummies and tested the
hypothesis that the dummies were jointly zero (where the variancecovariance matrix was computed using the ewey and West (1987) procedure.)
To calculate the standard deviation of the seasonal coefficients, we
regressed the log growth rate on twelve seasonal dummies and took the
standard deviation of the coefficients.Inthe fourth and fifth columns we
present the standard deviation in the estimated seasonal coefficients in
the log trowth rates of IP and Y4, along with the ratio of these standard
deviations to those in prices.

1967.01 set equal) for a selected group of industries are included in

logarithmic growth rates of the relevant series.

We employ growth rates

because the resulting series are likely to be stationary whether the
secular growth is generated by a unit root or by a deterministic time
trend.

In the Appendix (Table B2), we present results of Dickey Fuller

tests of the hypothesis of no unit root in the autoregressive

representation of these series.

In almost all of the 2-digit industries,

we do not reject the null hypothesis of a unit root at the 95% level of
significance.

sample period is May
1967 through December 1984.18

17We compute these test statistics as follows. For the means, we
regress the difference between the log growth rates of IF and Y4 on a
constant and test the hypothesis that the constant term is zero. For the
variances, we regress the log growth rate of IP on the difference between
the log growth rates of IF and Y4 and test the hypothesis that the
coefficient on the difference in growth rates is equal to .5. For the
autocorrelations, we stack the IF and Y4 observations and regress the
growth rate of output on the lagged growth rate, a dummy that is 1 for the
IF observations and 0 for the Y4 observations, and this dummy multiplied by
the lagged growth rate. The test statistic is the t-statistic on this last
variable. For the seasonal patterns, we regress the difference in log
growth rates on a constant and eleven seasonal dummies and test the
hypothesis that the coefficients on the eleven dummies are jointly equal to
zero.

In all of these tests, we use the Hansen and Hodrick (1980) / Newey
and West (1987) procedure to estimate the standard errors (with the lag
length set to 12 and the damping factor set to 1.0). These test procedures
therefore allow for general serial correlation and/or heteroskedasticicy in
the log growth rates of IF and Y4.
18We use only post-1967 data because there were changes in the
definitions of the SIC codes in 1967 that make the pre-1967 data not
completely compatible with post-1967 data.

input is estimated as a one sided distributed lag of IP but a two sided
distributed lag of the SEA's measure of shipments or shipments plus the
change in finished goods inventories (see Sims' footnote 20). Sims
interprets this as evidence that shipments (as a proxy for output), or
shipments plus the change in inventories, may be measured with greater
error than IP.

20The correlations between IP and shipments (unadjusted for inventory
changes) are actually greater than those between IP and '14 in 14 of 20
industries in the SA data (10 of 20 in the NSA data).

in the construction of the data, they are not able to offer a definitive
explanation.

and detrending techniques were all chosen to

correspond as closely as possible to Blinder (1986).

Thus, unlike the data

in the previous tables, these data are levels (not growth rates), detrended
with an exponential trend, and cover the period 1959:2 to 1981:7.27 We
against this possibility, we examine an alternate IP series calculated by
the FRB using gross value weights (this was available for seasonally
adjusted total manufacturing only, beginning in 1972). Over the period
72:3 to 84:12, we find that the correlation of growth rates between this
series and the standard IP is equal to .83. The correlation between this
series and Y4 is equal to .59, compared to a correlation of the standard It
and '14 of .65 over the same time period.
Thus, the use of value added
weights does not appear to be a quantitatively important source of the
difference between IP and Y4.

26Tf cost shocks are present, then this inequality need not hold
(Eichenbauni (1984), Blinder (1986)). Kahn (1987) argues that if production
for the period must be chosen before sales are known and if stockouts are
possible then this inequality can be violated even in the absence of cost
shocks.
27Blinder's estimation procedure is the following.
For both shipments
the log level is regressed on a constant, time, a dummy variable
that is one beginning in October 1973, and a dummy that is one beginning in

are quite different.

The results for the IF measure,

however,

The variance ratio is in most cases less than the one

based on Y4, and for 11 industries the variance inequality is actually
reversed.30

It is especially noteworthy that reversals occur in five of

the six industries identified by Belsley (1969) as production to stock;

these are the industries for whith the production smoothing model is the
most plausible theoretically.31 Had Blinder originally chosen to use IP

but in
(Blinder's paper states that his dummy begins in January 1966,
private conversation he has informed us that his dummy begins in January
1967.) The coefficients are estimated by GLS, assuming a second order
autoregressive process for the error term. The antilogs of the fitted
values of this regression are then subtracted from the actual data, in
levels, to define the detrended data.
28Because the ratio of average Y4 to average IF is different for
different averaging periods, the choice of base period for conversion of IF
sometimes affects the resulting variance bounds ratio for s few industries.
Results for different base periods consistently show, however, that the
variance ratio using IF data is less than the ratio using Y4 data in a
significant number of cases.
29The minor differences between the Y4 results in our Table 3 and
Blinder's Table I are probably due to data revisions that were released
subsequent to Blinder's work but incorporated in our data.
30This reversal of the variance bounds inequality was first pointed
out by West (1986, footnote 13).
31These six industries are food, tobacco, apparel, chemicals,
petroleum, and rubber.

about the empirical validity of the production smoothing model.32
V. The Sources and Importance of Measurement Error

measured with error. Up until this point, none of our results has required

of measurement error in each series under alternative assumptions about the

successfully)

to determine which types

of measurement error are most likely

to be present.

We consider two types of measurement error, as in Mankiw, Runkle, and

Unfortunately, obtaining three sample moments does not enable us to
estimate five population moments (although we can estimate certain
combinations of the moments).
As an example of the difficulties with inference, note that a large
variance of e type measurement error tends to increase the variance of
measured output, but a large variance of u type measurement error tends to
decrease the variance of measured output.

that the log growth rate of IF has a smaller variance than Y4 could mean
that IF is a better series (smaller classical type measurement error) or
that IF is a worse series (larger artificial smoothing or larger rational
forecast error).33 Distinguishing between these possibilities and
estimating the relevant parameters requires either additional identifying
assumptions or additional information.

measurement errors is less than that in the growth rate of the true series,
higher measurement error variance decreases the autocorrelation of the
growth rate of the measured series in a model with only e type measurement
error, while higher measurement error variance increases the
autocorrelation of the growth rate of the measured series with only u type
measurement error. Thus, the fact that the growth rate of Y4 has a lower
autocorrelation than IF could again be evidence of a large e type
measurement error in Y4 or a large u type measurement error in IF.

The results are presented in Table 4.

Looking at the seasonally

adjusted data, these estimates indicate that in all but one industry at
least 60% of the variation in the growth rate of Y4 is due to measurement
error, and in 16 out of 20 industries it is over 80%.

Looking at IF, we

find that in 15 out of 20 industries measurement error accounts for over
35% of the variation in the monthly growth rate.

The estimated standard

errors of the ratios indicate that in most cases they are estimated
precisely. When we turn to the seasonally unadjusted data, we find a
different set of results.

Relative to the seasonally adjusted data, the

measurement error shares are estimated to be smaller for Y4 and IF, and
often negative for IF.

type measurement error in IP.

While we have exhausted all of the information in the sample moments
within each induatry, we next consider using information about variations
in moments and construction of the IP data across industries.

An

important part of the measurement error in IF may be due to the fact that a
large number of the individual IF series are constructed from input data.
Theoretically, the use of input data could add either e type measurement
error because it involves added noise, or u type error because the use of
inputs to measure output may omit productivity changes.44 If the error
induced by the use of input data is primarily of the smoothing variety
(u11'),

then industries based most on input data should exhibit the most

smoothing,

and thus should have the lower variance (relative to that of

However, if the use of input data simply causes more classical

measurement error (efl), the high input data industries should have
relatively high variance.

We estimate the Spearman rank correlation

between the use of input data (as reported in Table 1) and the difference
of the variances of IF and Y4 to be -.48 and

This negative correlation provides evidence that

error is present in the IF data and is related to the use of inputs.

The

interpretation is that the use of inputs for IF serves to artificially
smooth the data and therefore that the relatively low standard deviation

of IF should not necessarily be taken to mean that it is a better measure
of true output.46
One final point, suggested by the NSA results, concerns the
possibility that the true coefficients relating IF and 14 to y* are not
equal to one.

Recall that in the model above, the regreasion of IF on Y4

and the regression of Y4 on IF each give a coefficient that is biased
downward from the true coefficient of one. However, in the NSA results,
regression of

i.e. even if

this is an issue, we can still conclude that measurement error is an
important part of industrial production under an e type model of
measurement error.

VI. Concluding Remarks

In this paper we have documented the radically different time series
properties of two different measures of monthly manufacturing output.
Under specific assumptions about the nature of the measurement error, we
estimate that a large fraction of the variation in the observed growth rate
of both measures of output is due to measureaent error.

These results

suggest that empirical analyses that rely heavily on the time series
properties of the month to month variation in either of these measures may
give very misleading results.
There are ample reasons for the presence of noise in both series. For
Y4, real monthly inventory changes are extremely difficult to estimate from

book value data. For IF, the use of inputs to proxy for output involves
strong assumptions about productivity.

In both cases, there is likely to be

Notes:

1. The sample period is 1967:5-1984:12.
2. The statistics in the table are computed for monthly logarithmic growth rates.
3. The Y4 results are based on the finished goods plus work-in-progressdefinition of output.
4. The t-statistics are for tests of the hypotheses that the relevant moments are the same. The
x2 statistic is for the test of the hypothesis that the seasonal patterns in the log growth rates
of IP and Y4 are the same. The 95% critical value of the x2(1l) is 19.61.

Notes:

The sample period is 1968:3-1984:12.
The entries in the table are the t-statistics on the lagged log level of output from a regression
of the log growth rate on a constant, a time trend, the lagged log level of the series, and lags
one through twelve of the log growth rate of the series. A value of -3.43 is required to reject
the null at the 95% level.
3. The Y4 resmits in columns 2 and 4 are based on the finished goods only definition of output. The
Y4 results in columns 6 and 8 are based on the finished goods plus work-in-progess definition
of output.
