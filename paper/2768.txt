UNEXPECTED INFLATION, REAL WAGES, AND EMPLOYMENT DETERMINATION
IN UNION CONTRACTS

ABSTRACT
This paper presents new microeconometric evidence on the
relevance of nominal contracting for employment determination in the
unionized sector.

Real wages in long term union contracts contain an

and the degree of indexation.

These unexpected wage components

provide a convenient tool for separating the causal effects of wages
on employment from other endogenous sources of employment and wage
variation.
The empirical analysis of employment and wage outcomes among
collective agreements in the Canadian manufacturing sector reveals
that employment and wages are only weakly related.

When unexpected

More recent models of macro

however, have downplayed the role of nominal wage rigidities.

Real business cycle models (for example, Kydland and Prescott (1982))
assume that supply and demand in the labor market are equilibrated at
Walrasian levels, and ignore the institutional structure of wage
determination.

Recent business cycle models in the Keynesian tradition,

the other hand, have shifted attention from nominal wage rigidities

on

to real

wage rigidities (e.g. Blanchard and Summers (1986)) or nominal price
rigidities (e.g. Mankiw (1985), Blanchard and Kiyotaki (1987)).
The shift in interest away from models of nominal wage rigidity can be

attributed to two complementary forces.

On the theoretical side, there are

as yet no convincing explanations for the existence of nominally-fixedwage
contracts.

Many of the contracting models developed over the past decade

predict constant real wages or constant real earnings.1 More generally,
the existence of long-term attachments

in the labor market calls into

question the assumption that employment is allocated on the basis of

current

wage rates.

Even with micro-level

I find strong support for the implications of a naive

contracting model: unexpected changes in prices over the course of a
contract lead to unanticipated real wage changes that in turn generate
systematic employment responses.

Furthermore, real wage losses or gains in

one contract spill over to subsequent ones.

Thus, unanticipated price

changes generate persistent real wage changes and persistent employment
responses in the union sector.
In fact, unanticipated real wage changes play a central role in the
empirical

analysis.

Unanticipated real wage changes that occur during the term of fixed-wage or

By construction,

these changes are correlated with

wages but uncorrelated with omitted variables that effect the expected
component

of real wages.

They therefore form an ideal instrumental

variable for a structural analysis of employment demand.
The empirical analysis confirms the usefulness of this approach.
Controlling for industry demand conditions, employment is only weakly
correlated with the level of contract wages.

Model of Lona Term Contracts

Interpreting the Correlation of Employment and Wases
This section presents a simple model of long term contracting in which

nominal wages are pre-determined,

and employment is set unilaterally by the

firm after aggregate prices and firm-specific demand shocks are observed.
Even in this simple model, the interpretation of the partial correlation of
employment and real wages is clouded by the fact that the contracting
parties may have better information on future demand shocks than is
available

to an outside data analyst.

To develop this point more formally,

suppose that wages are negotiated in some base period (period 0) for a

contract of duration T.

Let n(t) and w(t) denote the logarithms of

employment and real wages in period t of the contract, respectively,
assume that hours per worker are fixed.

The notion of

and

"nominal

contracting" is captured by the assumption that the bargaining parties do
not set w(t) directly:
increases

rather, they establish a series of nominal wage

from the start of the contract, possibly in conjunction with an

indexation formula.5

5The nature of typical indexation formulas in North American labor
contracts is described in Card (1983). The only case in which the real
wage is set directly by the parties is the case of a contract in which
nominal wages are indexed to the consumer price level with a formula that
increases the wage by one percent for each percent increase in prices.
Such formulas are extremely rare, particularly in the manufacturing sector
of the U.S. and Canada.
6This point is made by Hendricks and Kahn (1987).

Implicitly then, the contractual wage is assumed to

be high enough to ensure a perfectly elastic supply of workers.
This simple model is completed by a specification of the determinants

The extent of simultaneity bias in ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates

Even in the frsmework of this simple model, however, there are two

of labor demand.

The first is the case in which the forecast error in real

A

simple way to

control for this possibility is to include consumer price increases
directly in the employment equation, and to use variation across contracts
in the degree of wage indexation to separately identify the effects of
unanticipated wage changes and aggregate price changes.
A second, potentially more serious difficulty may arise if employment
adjustment is costly, and if unexpected changes in real wages during the
term of a contract are immediately offset in subsequent negotiations.

In

this case, one would not expect to observe significant employment responses

On the other

A finding of insignificant

The degree of persistence in unexpected wage changes, in turn, is

for assessing

the magnitude of the effect that these changes will

The analysis is based on two alternative measures of negotiated wages:

for employment setting behavior in the last few months of an existing

By comparison, the expected average real wage over the next

contract gives a longer-term measure of the costs of contractual
employment.

In the present context, however,

the interval of observation on employment

months.

Thus, the extent of incomplete adjustment

is likely to be much

smaller than that observed in quarterly or annual data.

This issue is

addressed more thoroughly below.
Estimation results for the first-differenced employment equation are

of the contract.

Employment is positively related to intermediate input

prices and positively related to both current and last year's level of

Conclusions
This paper studies the nature of employment determination

in long-term

A key aspect of these contracts, much emphasized in the

macroeconomics literature, is the fact that nominal wages are partly or
wholly pre-determined.

Real wage rates at the end of a contract therefore

contain unanticipated components that reflect unexpected changes in
consumer prices over the life of the contract and the degree of indexation
in the contract.

These unanticipated real wage changes provide a

convenient tool for separating the causal effect of wages on employment
determination from other ertdogenous sources of employment and wage
variation.

The empirical analysis is based on a large panel of collective
bargaining agreements from Canadian manufacturing.

In this sample,

contract-to-contractchanges in employment are only weakly related to
corresponding changes in contractual wages.

When unexpected changes in

real wages are used as an instnimental variable for wages, however,

employment is consistently negatively related to contract wages.

This

finding suggests that the characteristicallyweak correlations between
employment and wages reported in many previous studies may be due in part
to the endogenous determination of wages in the labor market.

Once this

endogeneity is taken into account, the results from this study suggest that

27The finding that firm-level employment is positively related to
industry average wages is also reported by Nickell and Wadhwani (1987).

32

employment and wages at the firm level are significantly negatively
related.

Two other findings emerge from the empirical analysis.

First,

unanticipated changes in prices generate changes in real wages not only
during the term of existing contracts, but also in subsequent agreements.
Second,

there is no evidence that contractual

employment

determination is

related to outside wage rates in a manner consistent with simple models of
efficient

contracting.

Rather, the empirical results suggest that

employment outcomes in union contracts are determined on a conventional
downward-slopingdemand schedule, taking the prevailing contract wage as
given.

These findings underscore

the importance of the institutional

structure of wage determination for the cyclical properties and persistence
of employment changes.

(e) Industry selling prices, input prices, and output.

Three-digit

industry level annual data for 1961-71 were taken from Statistics
Canada's Real Domestic Product By Industry 1961-71 (Ottawa,
Statistics Canada).

These data are classified by 1960 standard

industrial codes (SIC's).

Data on a 1971 SIC basis for 1971-83

were taken from the 1978 and 1984 issues of Gross Domestic Product

By Industry (Ottawa: Statistics Canada).

The 1960 and 1971 SIC

codes were then matched, and the price and output indexes spliced
using the 1971 observations from the two sources.

Of 65 3-digit

industries represented in the contract sample, there were a total
of 31 for which 3-digit level data was not available on
consistent basis.

Implicit price

by the annual average consumer price index to obtain real
selling prices and input prices used in the paper.
