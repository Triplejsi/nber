The debt crisis of the 1980's has inspired search for innovative

solutions to the debt problem.
so far, debt forgiveness

Amongst the many proposals that have emerged

and debt conversion schemes play a central role.

One

of the proposed mechsnisms for debt forgiveness is to establish an
international

corporation

that will buy back the debt of developing countries

and forgive part of it (see Peter B. Kenen (1983)).

The proposal has been

debated, but so far no action has been taken toward its implementation.

Contrary to the Corporation's

proposal, debt conversion schemes

So far only a small share of debt has been

-2-

converted by means of these schemes- -about 2% of the debt of countries that
have engaged in them--but they may become much more important in the fucure.
When debt is exchanged for equity it is called a debt-equity swap (see Lewis
S.

Alexander (l987a) for more factual details).
One central idea behind the Corporation and the debt conversion schemes

is to take advantage

of the high discounts on debt on the secondsry market.

It is quite common for debts to be traded at 50 cents to the dollar, with some
debts being traded at even higher discounts.

Hence, it is argued, debt

forgiveness may be not very costly and the debtor may gain from the conversion

of cheap debt into holdings of other domestic assets.

In both cases the debt

burden is eased.
This paper is concerned with debt-equity swaps in which foreign residents

A minimal framework for dealing with some basic issues is developed in
the following section.

It is based on the assumption that the debtor's real

income is a random variable,

and that its foreign debt is government owned.

As a result of output fluctuations and limits on its ability to tax, the
government's capacity to service debt is also random.

Conclusions

Debt-equity swaps and debt forgiveness are practical issues that require
careful analysis.

The results of this paper demonstrate that there do not

exist simple and clear-cut answers to a number of major questions, but they

-

-23-

also show how to identify relevant considerations.

Some of the conclur ns

are:

1.

Small debt-equity

swaps can be beneficial

to both parties, but this is not

always the case.
2.

In the presence of a compecicive fringe of credicors there is a uniqe

price at which a swap of a given size can

being higher the larger the swap.
3.

Under these circumstances

small swaps may fail to take place despite the

existence of Pareto-improving deals.
4.

Debt forgiveness may reduce investment in the debtor country, thereby
imposing a secondary cost via a reduction of debt service payments.

5.

debt-equity swap may increase or reduce investment.

In all cases with ambiguous answers, we have identified the conflicting
elements that have to be assessed empirically.
Finally,

considerations

of

that have to be borne

For example, capital controls are typically not as tight as assumed

in the model, and it is therefore important to consider the effect of a awap
on net capital inflow.

This is the more so the larger the deviation of the

shadow price of capital from the market price.

And there exists the problem

of "round-tripping", which results from loopholes that enable investors to
obtain subsidies embedded in existing swap arrangements without fulfilling all
other obligations.

Naturally,

these problems exist on top of the problems

discussed in the paper and they deserve separate treatment.
