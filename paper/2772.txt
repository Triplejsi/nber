A PROBABILITY MODEL OF THE COINCIDENT ECONOMIC INDICATORS

ABSTRACT

The Index of Coincident Economic Indicators, currenrly compiled by rhe U.S.
Deparrmenr of Commerce, is designed to measure the srate of overall economic

activity. The index is constructed as a weighted average of four key
macroeconomic time series, where the weights are obtained using rules that

dare to the early days of business cycle analysis. This paper presents an
explicit rime series model (formally, a dynamic factor analysis or "singleindex" model) rhar implicitly defines a variable that can be thought of as the

overall state of the economy. Upon estimating this model using data from
1959-1987, the estimate of this unobserved variable is found to be highly
correlated with the official Commerce Department series, particularly over

business cycle horizons. Thus this model provides a formal rationalization
for the traditional methodology used to develop the Coincident Index. Initial
exploratory exercises indicate that traditional leading variables can prove
useful in forecasting the short-run growth in this series.

1. Introduction

Since their initial development in 1938 by Wesley Mitchell, Arthur Burns,
and their colleagues at the Nntional Bureau of Economic Research, the
Composite Indexes of Coincident and Leading Economic Indicators have played an
important role in summarizing the state of macroeconomic activity.

This

paper reconsiders the problem of constructing an index of coincident

indicators. We will use the techniques of modern time series analysis to
develop an explicit probability model of the four coincident variables that
comprise the Index of Coincident Economic Indicators (CEI) currently compiled

by the Department of Commerce (DOC). This probability model provides a
framework for computing sn alternative coincident index. As it turns out,
this alternative index is quantitatively similar to the DOC index. Thus this
probability model provides a formal statistical rationalization for, and

interpretation of, the construction of the DOC CEI. This alternative
interpretation complements that provided by the methodology developed by
Mitchell and Burns (1938) and applied by, for example, Zarnowitz and Boachan
(1975).

The model adopted in this paper is based on the notion that the comovements
in aany macroeconomic variables have a common element that can be captured by

a single underlying, unobserved variable. In the abatract, this variable
represents the general "state of the economy." The problem is to estimate the
current atate of the economy, i.e. this common element in the fluctuations of

key aggregate time series variables. This unobserved variable of the economy" - -

must

- the

"atate

be defined before any attempt can be made to estimate

-1-

it. In technical terms, this requires formulating a probability model that
provides a mathematical definition of the unobserved state of the economy. In

nontechnical tens, this problem can be phrased as a question: What do the
leading indicators lead?

Our proposed answer to this question is given in Section 2. This section
presents a parametric "single-index" model in which the state of the economy
--

referred

to as G --

is

an unobserved variable common to multiple aggregate

time series. Because this model is linear in the unobserved variables, the
Kalman Filter can be used to construct the Gaussian likelihood function and
thereby to estimate the unknown parameters of the model by maximum likelihood.
As a side benefit, the Kalman Filter automatically computes the minimum mean

square error estimate of G using data through period t. This estimate,
is the alternative index of coincident indicators computed using the singleindex model.

The single-index model ia estimated using data on industrial production,
real personal income, real manufacturing and trade aales, and employment in

nonagricultural eatabliahments from 1959 to 1987. The results are reported in
Section 3. Also in this section, the estimated alternative index

is

compared with the DOG series. The similarity between the two is striking,
particularly over business-cycle horizons.
Section 4 presents an initial investigation into forecasting the growth of

uaing a variety of leading or predictive macroeconomic variables. The
main conclusion is that a paraimoniously parameterized time aeriea model with
and aix leading variablea can forecast approximately two-thirds of the

variance of the growth in

over the next aix months.

A conceptually diatinct forecasting problem is explored in Section 5. A
traditional focus of business cycle analysis baa of course been identifying

-2-

expansions and contractions. Seversl recent forecasting exercises have
focused on forecasting turning points; see, for example, Hymans (1973), Wecker
(1979), Zsrnowitz and Moore (1982), Kling (1987), and Zellner, Hong and Gulati

(1987). Rather thsn focusing on turning points, the approach taken in Section
5 is to forecast directly the binary variable representing whether the economy

is in s recession or expansion six months hence. The main conclusion is that,
among the binary-response models considered, expansions can be forecasted

fairly reliably, recessions less so. Section 6 concludes.

2. The Coincident Indicator Model: Specification end Estimation

One approach to studying aggregate fluctuations is to pick an important
econosic time series -- aay employment or GNP -- as the object of interest for

subsequent anslysis and foretasting. This decided, life becomes relatively
easy, since economists have decades of experience constructing models to

analyze and to forecsst observable time series variables. From the
perspective of business cycle snslysis, however, this approach is rather

limited. Individual series measure more or less well-defined concepts, such
ss the value of all goods and services produced in a quarter or the total

number of individuals working for pay. But these series measure only various
facets of the overall state of economic activity; none messure the state of
the economy (in Burns and Mitchell's (1946) terminology, the "reference

cycle") directly. Moreover, even the concepts that the series purport to
measure are measured with error.1
The formulstion developed here is based instead on the assumption that
there is a single unobserved variable common to many macroeconomic time

-3-

series. This places Burns and Mitchell's (1946) reference cycle in a fully
specified probability model. The proposed model is a parsinetric version of
the "single-index" models discussed by Sargent and Sims (1977), in which the
single unobserved index is common to multiple macroeconomic variables.
Estimates of this unobserved index, constructed using vsriables that move
contemporaneously with this index, provide an alternative index of coincident

indicators. This index can then be forecasted using leading variables.

A. The Single-Index Model
Let

denote a nxl vector of macroeconomic time series variables that are

hypothesized to move contemporaneously with overall economic conditions. In

the single-index model, X consists of two stochastic components: the common
unobserved scalar time series variable, or "index", C, and a n-dimensional
component that represents idiosyncratic movements in the series and

measurement error, v. Both the unobserved index and the idiosyncratic
component are modeled as having linear stochastic structures. In addition, C
is assumed to enter each of the Variables contemporaneously. This suggests
the formulation:

(1)

(2)

(L)C —

(3)

(L)v —

&

+

-4-

where L denotes the lag operstor, (L) is a acalar lag polynomials, and (L)
is a lag polynomial matrix. According to (1), Ct enters each of the n
equations in (1), although with varying lags and weights.
As an empirical matter, many macroeconomic time series are well
characterized as containing atochaatic trends; see, for example, Nelson and
Plosser (1982) .

A theoretical possibility is that these stochastic trends

would enter through Ct; in this caae, each element of X,. would contain a

stochastic trend, but this trend would be common to each element. Thus X
would be cointegrated of order k-l as defined by Engle and Cranger (1987).
Looking ahead to the empirical results, however, this turns out not to be the

case: while we cannot reject the hypothesis that the coincident aeriea we
consider individually contain a stochastic trend, neither can we reject the

hypothesis that there is no cointegration among these variables.2 The ayatem
(l)-(3) is therefore reformulated in terms of the changes (or, more precisely,

the growth rates) of the variables. Specifically, aaaume that (L) and tHL)
can be factored so that (L)-*(L)a and 5(L)—D(L)a, where a—l-L. Let

practice, X will be a vector of the logarithms of time series variables,

so that

is a vector of their growth ratea. The lag polynomials (L) and

D(L) are assumed to have finite orders p and k, respectively.

-5-

The main identifying assumption in the model expresses the tore notion of
the single-index model that the comovements of the multiple time series arise

from the single source C. This is made precise by assuming that

(u1

untACt) are mutually uncorrelated at all leads and lags. (When

there are four or more variables this imposes testable overidentifying

restrictions, which will be examined empirically below.) This is achieved by
assuming that D(L) is diagonal and that the n+l disturbances are mutually
untorrelated:

In

addition, the scale of ACt is identified by setting var(?7)_l. (This is a

normalization with no substantive implications.)

A final identifying assumption is required to estimate the mean growth rate
for

This mean is calculated here as a weighted average of the growth

rates of the constituent series. The weights are those implicitly used to

construct ACtv from the original data series. That is, in this model ACtit
can be written,

where W(L) is a lxn lag polynomial vector. The mean of ACtit equals W(l)',

where W(l)—oW and

denotes the mean of Y. This implies,

Taken together, these assumptions provide sufficient identifying
restrictions to estimate the unknown parsmeters of the model snd to extract

estimates of C.

B. State Space Representation
The first step towards estimating the model (4)-(6) is to cast it into a
state space form so that the Kalman Filter can be used to evsluste the

likelihood function. This formulstion has two parts, the state equation and
the measurement equation. The state equation describes the evolution of the

and their lags. The

unobserved state vector, which consists of Act,

measurement equation relates the observed variables to the elements of the
state vector.

The transition equation obtains by combining (5) and (6). Because one
objective is to estimate the level of ct using information up to time t, it is

convenient to augment these equations at this point by the identity ctl
The transition equation for the state ia thus given by:

function for a trial set of parameters; for a discussion, see Harvey (1981).

covariance matrix, E[(mt-Emt)(mt-Emt)']; that is, m010—O and

P010—'oT3z4'. Alternatively, one could set P010 to an arbitrary
constant matrix. In this case, the estimates are asymptotically equivalent to
maximum likelihood.

3. Empirical Results for the Coincident Model

This section presents estimates of the single-index model using four

monthly time series for the United States from 1959:2 to 1987:12. The series
are those used to construct the DOC coincident series: industrial production
(IP), total personal income less transfer payments in 1982 dollars (CMYXP8),

total manufacturing and trade sales in 1982 dollars (MT82), and employees on
nonagricultural payrolls (LPNAG). The data were obtained from the August,

1988 release of Citibase. Throughout, we adopt the Citihase mnemonics for the
variables when applicable.

A. Preliminary Data Analysis
The first step in specifying the model is to test for whether the series

are integrated and, if they are, whether they are cointegrated. For each of

-

12

-

the coincident indicators, Dickey and Fuller's (1979) test for a unit root
(against the alternative that the series are stationary, perhaps around a
linear time trend) was unable to reject (at the 10% level) the hypothesis that

the series are integrated. The subsequent application of the Stock-Watson
(1986) test of the null hypothesis that the four series are not cointegraced
against the alternative of cointegration failed to reject at the 66%

significance level. Thus these tests provided no evidence against the
hypothesis that each series is integrated but they are not cointegrated. We

therefore estimated the model (-(6) using for

the first difference of the

logarithm of each of the coincident series, standardized to have zero mean and
unit variance.

The single-index model imposes the restriction that all the comovements in

the series arise from a single source. Tests of this restriction, against the
hypothesis that the coincident indicators have s spectral density matrix that
is finite and nonsingular but otherwise unrestricted, were implemented by

Sargent and Sims (1977). Their test examines the implication that the
spectral density matrix of Y, averaged over any frequency bands, will have a
factor structure in the sense of conventional factor analysis; thus the
dynamic aingle-index restrictions may be tested by testing the "single factor"
restrictions for a set of these bands and then aggregating the results.
Specifically, since

and Au are by assumption uncorrelated at all leads

and lags, (4) implies that S(w) _7Sac(W)1'+ u'4' where S(w) denotes the
spectral density matrix of Y at frequency w, etc. Because SAC(u) is a scalar

and

is diagonal, this implies a testable restriction on S(w).

Performing this test for the coincident indicator model over six equally-

spaced bands constructed using Y (where the averaged matrix periodogram

-

13

-

provides the unconstrained estimate of the spectrum) provides little evidence

against the dynamic single-index structure: the

test statistic is 19.8,

having a p-value of 92%.

B. Maximum Likelihood Estimates
The parameters of two single-index models were estimated using IF, GMYXP8,

MT82, and LPNAG over the period 1959:2-1987:12. In both models, a second
order autoregressive specification was adopted for AC, so that p'-2.

In the

first, the errors u are modeled as an AR(l) (k—l); in the second, they are
modeled as an P1(2) (k—2). The log likelihood for the P1(l) model is 327.77,
and for the AR(2) model is 341.38. A likelihood ratio teat easily rejects the
hypothesis that the additional four autoregressive parameters are zero. We
therefore adopt the P1(2) specification henceforth.

The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the single-index

model are presented in Table 1. The negative estimates of d1 for IF and MT82
indicate that the idiosyncratic component of these series exhibits negative
serial correlation, although the idiosyncratic component of LFNAG exhibits

substantial positive aerial correlation. The estimated model for the
unobserved component exhibits substantial first order - -

but

limited second-

order -- dependence, with roots of (.60,-OS).

Statistics that examine the fit of the single-index model are presented in

Table 2. The teats assess whether the disturbances in the obaerved variables
are predictable: if the estimated model is correctly specified, they should be

serially uncorrelated. The results suggest satisfactory specifications for
the IF, GMYXF8, and MT82 equations. However, the disturbance in LFNAG is
forecastable by each lagged disturbance and variable in the model, indicating

misspecification of the LPNAG equation. A possible source of this
aisspecification is that LPNAG is not an exactly coincident variable, but

slightly lags the unobserved factor. This could be investigated by including

lags of C in the equation for LPNAG in (4). Alternatively, one might change
the dynamic specification for U4c. We do not, however, pursue these options
for two reasons. First, with the exception of the LPNAC equation, the overall
fit of the model appears to be good. Second, and more importantly, our
primary objective is to see whether a purely coincident single-index model can
rationalize the DOG coincident index; adopting a mixed coincident/lagging

single-index specification would defeat this purpose. We therefore proceed
with the coincident single-index model of Table I, but raise the apparent
misapecification of the LPNAG equation as an issue for future research.

C. Comparison Between Ctit and the DOC Series

We now examine the relation between the contemporaneous estimate C1 of C
obtained using the coincident single-index model and the Index of Coincident
Indicatora published by the Department of Commerce, henceforth referred to as

COC. The summary statistics reported in Table 3 indicate that these series
are highly correlated, but that the standard deviation of the growth rate of

COC exceeds that of Ctit by 80%. This is a consequence of how COC is
constructed: the weights on the deviations of the constituent series from
their means aum to 1.8, while the weights implicitly used to construct ACtit

sum to 1. This difference affects the graphical presentation of the series in
levels, but of course not the correlations or other functions of centered
momenta estimated using their growth rates.

To facilitate a graphical comparison, we calculated a series CIt by
DOG

scaling ACtit to have the same variance as the growth in C and to have

construct the levels series

The series C° and CIt, are plotted in Figure 1. Although the mean
growth rates differ, the two series exhibit a striking similarly. One of the
few noticeable differences between the two series is the somewhat slower
average growth of

and C1 provides an additional indication of their similarity.

These weights, normalized to add to one, are presented in Table 4. The two
sets of weights are generally similar. For example, contemporaneous values
receive most of the weight in

(and 100% in co'). The major exception

is that a second lag of LPNAG receives a substantial negative weight.

A final measure of the relation between C1 and C30 is the coherence
between their growth rates; this is plotted in Figure 2. The very high
estimated coherence at low frequencies (in excess of 95% for periods over two

years) indicates that the two series are very similar at horizons associated
with the business cycle.
In summary, these measures all suggest that the coincident index
estimated using single-index model agrees closely with the current DOC GET,
especially at business cycle frequencies.

Notes: The weights are normalized so that they add to one. The weights
implicitly used to construct the C° computed by regressing the growth rate
of the Commerce series on contemporaneous values of the growth rates of the
four series used in its construction: industrial production (IP), real
personal income (GMYXP8), real manufacturing and trade sales (MT82), and
employment at nonagricultural establishments (LPNAG). Thus the weights for
all lgs other than the contemporaneous variables are zero by construction.
The R2 of this regression, estimated from 61:1 to 87:12, is .937. Reasons why
the R would be less than one include rounding error and minor differences
between our series and those used by the DOC to construct the index. The
weights implicitly used to construct CtIt were obtained by computing the

variables. Of these, model 9 was selected as the "base" model for subsequent
analysis.

B. An Examination of Additional Variables
This base model provides a framework for assessing the marginal predictive

content of alternative leading variables. This is done by including trial
variables, one at a time, as additional leading variables in the mixed

autoregressive system. The results for selected variables are reported in
Table 6.

(The variable definitions are provided in Appendix A.)

The strongest evidence of additional predictive content comes from yields

on various financial instruments. Theory suggests that bond and stock prices
will incorporate expectations of various aspects of future economic

performance and so should be useful leading indicators. Yet it is perhaps
surprising that these variables provide additional useful information, because
the base model already includes two interest rates (FYOT1O and FYGM3) and an
2

interest-sensitive series, HSBP. These high R values should be interpreted
cautiously, however. For the interest rates, at least, the two largest R2's
drop in the 1980's, indicating potential instability of these series as useful

leading indicators. It is also interesting to note that stock prices help to
forecast

not by predicting ACtit directly, but rather by helping to

forecast the other variables in the system which in turn are useful in
forecasting ACt it

Among selected BCD leading indicators (panel A), only IVPAC makes a

statistically strong contribution to the ACtR equation; but including IVPAC
actually reduces the six-step ahead forecasting performance. Measures of
productivity, prices, exchange rates, and services make only modest

Notes: The base model in the first line of this table is the mixed VAR, model
9 in Table 5. For each of the variables, the base model was augmented by the
equation and 1
trial variable, with 12 lags of the trial variable in the
lag of the trial variable entering each of the remaining six equations. The
p-values reported in the third and fourth columns refer to the F-tests of the
hypothesis that the coefficients on the indicated lags of the trial variable
in the

equation are zero. The

measures in the final two columns are

contributions. Two of the measures of money and credit - - FMBASE and FCBCTJC
--

made substantial improvements in the R2. However, money and credit

variables must be viewed with suspicion as stable leading indicators because
of recent changes in financial markets (see Friedman [19881 for a discussion).
This is highlighted by the very poor performance of the six-month ahead
forecasts based on FCLBMC in the 1980's.

In summary, the leading variables in the base model, along with some of the
variables in Table 6, indicate that approximately two-thirds of the variance
of the six-month ahead growth in

can be forecasted using restricted

autoregressive systems. The next step, left for further research, is to
assess the stability of these systems.

5. Forecasts of Recessions Using Leading Variables

This section presents an initial exploration of the possibility of
predicting whether six months hence the economy will be in a NBER-dated

recession. The approach taken here is to estimate several binary logit
models. The dependent variable is Rt÷6, where Rt.d. if the economy is in a

NBER-dated recession in month t, and Rt0 if not. The predictive variables
are the forecasts ft(l)

tutoregressive system with

calculated from an eight-variable mixed
IVMT82, MDU82, HSBP, FYGT1O, FYGT1O-FYGM3,

FYCP, and IPCD. In addition, individual leading variables were included, both
singly and as a group.

The logit models were estimated by maximum likelihood, It is important to
recognize that this likelihood is misspecified: because the dependent variable

-

-

refers to an event six months hence, the errors in the latent variable
equation (and che six-step ahead prediction errors) will in general have a

moving average structure. Thus this procedure should be viewed simply as
providing a convenient functional form for exploring the predictability of

The results are reported in Table 7. The first noteworthy result is that
the one- through six-step ahead forecasts of

produced by the eight-

variable mixed autoregression, by themselves produce a subatantial reduction

in the unexplained variance of Rt. In addition, these results suggest that
expansions can be forecasted accurately, but that the probability of correctl:

forecasting a receasion six months hence is the range of two thirds.
Considerable gains can be made by incorporating variables in addition to
£t(l)

t(6) ; financial variables seem particularly useful in this

regard.

The predictiona Rt+61t of the aix-month ahead NBER forecaata, computed

using model 15 in Table 7, are plotted in Figure 3. The dating convention in
thia figure ia that RtIt6 is plotted; for example, in the figure the July,
1982 probability is the forecast of the binary July, 1982 receaaion/expanaion

variable, made using data through January 1982. The actual NEER-dated
recessions are indicated by vertical lines. This plot bears out the falae
positive and false negative rates presented in the final two columna of Table

7. On the one hand, false recession forecaats occur relatively rarely, with
the largest false receaaion forecasts occurring during 1967 and throughout

1979. On the other hand, the aix-month-ahead receaaion probabilities rarely
approach one when in fact a recession does occur. For example, the aix-month
ahead probability of a receaaion incorrectly drops below 50% during the middi
of the 1970 contraction.

The dependent variable in

nonths in the future, and has a value of 0 if six months hence there is a
NBER-dated expansion. The mean value of this variable over the estimation

ft(6)) as regressors. Contemporaneous value (and the

using the actual (0/1) recession probabilities and their six-month ahead

6. Conclusions

The single-index model provides an explicit probability model for the
definition and estimation of an alternative index of coincident indicators.

The empirical model produces a coincident index that is strikingly similar to
the index currently computed by the Department of Commerce, particularly at

the low frequencies associated with business cycles. The main evidence of
misspecification in the empirical model appears in the equation for the

employment series, LPNAG. One possible explanation, to be explored in future
research, is that employment is a lagging rather than an exactly coincident
series.

The forecasting exercises of Sections 4 and S indicate that time series
models which incorporate leading variables can provide useful forecasts of the
growth of the coincident index, and of a variable that indicates whether the

economy is in a recession or expansion six months hence. This is unsurprising
in the sense that these leading variables are so categorized because of their

tendency to move in advance of the coincident index. The main contribution of
these empirical investigations is rather to provide some specific models with
which to make these forecasts, and some statistical measures of the within-

sample forecast quality. A noteworthy finding from this investigation is thst
financial prices and yields appear to have greater predictive value than do
measures of real output, real inputs, or prices of foreign or domestic goods.

Footnotes

I. Most modern research on the forecasting potential of the index of leading
indicators has focused on its ability to forecast not the reference cycle, but
some observable series such as industrial production or unemployment (e.g.
Stekler and Schepsman (1973), Vaccara and Zarnowitz [1978], Sargent [1979],

Auerbach [1982], and Koch and Raasche [1988]). Our perspective is closer to
that underlying the work of Diebold and Rudebusch (1987) and Hamilton (1987).

For a historical review of the development of the leading indicators, see
Moore (1979).

2. A different way to make this point is that we are examining comovements
among the first differences of the coincident variables at frequencies other
the only source of power at frequency

than zero. Were the common factor

zero in the spectra of the first differences, the spectral density matrix of
the first differences would be singular at frequency zero and the series would

be cointegrated. Harvey, Fernandez-Macho, and Stock (1987) discuss modeling
strategies for unobserved- component models with cointegrated variables.

3.

The state space representation (8) and (9) is not unique. In practice, it

is computationally more efficient to work with a lower-dimensional state

vector. This can be achieved by filtering Y,

and u in (4) by 0(L) and

treating e as a measurement error. The resulting state vector has dimension
p+l.
