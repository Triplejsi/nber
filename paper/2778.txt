Similar concerns have been expressed by others, e.g. Dornbusch (1987) and
Giavazzi (1987).

Dornbusch (1987) suggests that, given the probable

existance of large discrepancies in seigniorage needs among the European
countries, a more realistic exchange rate arrangement would be a crawling

In this system, the rates of depreciation would be set to meet

empirical issue.

it is important to establish whether

revenue needs have indeed affected the way in which inflation has been
determined in the past, and if they are likely to be important in the
future,

In order to address these issues, we first present a simple theory of
seigniorage and income taxation,

2.1

A Common Argument for Uncommon Currencies:

The Inflation Tax'

A Simple Closed Economy lodel of Optimal Seigniorage
For an exchange rate system to be reasonably stable it is necessary

that the inflation rates of the participating countries do not diverge in
the long run.

Therefore, it is important to understand the criteria

according to which monetary growth is determined in the various countries,
and if they imply converging rates of inflation.

Table 1 presents the

1950 for the ten
average rates of inflation in selected sub-periods since

European countries.

The average rate of inflation has increased in all of

the countries after the collapse of the Bretton- Woods system.

In the

period of flexible exchange rates between 1971 and 1978 the rate of
inflation has been, on average, highest.

While in the Eighties the rate of

inflation has been, on average, lower than in the Seventies, the
cross-country variance has been the highest. Why is inflation diverging
across the countries, and is this pattern likely to continue?
There are several ways of modelling the process that generates
inflation. In the most popular models the authorities, following a
Phillips curve inspired policy, try to use inflation for stabilization
purposes.

lore recently, game theoretic applications of this idea,

initiated

by Barro and Gordon (1983), have pointed out that, if the

authorities cannot credibly commit to time inconsistent policies, the
equilibrium will be characterized by high (sub-optimal)

rates of inflation.

Since the equilibrium inflation rate depends on the particular structure of
the economy and on the objective function of the authorities, this approach
could potentially explain cross-country differences in inflation.

4

A different but not necessarily alternative approach investigates the
potential connection between inflation and government financing decisions.
This way of looking at the problem, while not novel, has recently received
renewed attention, perhaps because budgetary problems have become the
central issue in the policy debate.

According to this approach,

the proper

way of looking at inflation is from a public finance point of view.

Also,

in the Eighties,

both the average expenditure-output

ratio and its cross country variance has been higher than in the Seventies.
These figures seem to be compatible with a public finance-oriented
explanation of inflation.

In order to construct a more formal way of

testing the validity of this theory, we present a simple benchmark model,
close in spirit to the work on optimal inflation tax by Phelps (1973), and
which has been recently used by lankiw (1987) and Grilli (1988).
The basic structure of the model is straight forward.

The

government's problem is to choose the optimal mix of distortionary taxes
and deficit to finance an exogenous and stochastic stream of expenditure.

Formally, the problem can be expressed as:

respectively. The costs of income taxation are associated with

its distortionary effects on labor supply and with the administrative costs

The costs of raising seigniorage are related to the

distortionary effects of inflation.

Even if not evident from the way we formulated the problem, the
optimal policy implied by P-i may not be time consistent. As originally
pointed out by Calvo (1978), the difficulty arises because inflation may be
distortionary ex-ante, but not ex-post.

This will be the case, for

example, if the only costs associated with inflation are its negative

effects on (forward looking) money demand.

Fix-post, i.e. after individuals

made their decisions about their cash holdings, the monetary authorities
may deviate from the "ex-ante optimal" rate of inflation, thus increasing
seigniorage without inducing a reduction in cash holdings.

This

however, is not crucial to the analysis. First, for some

of the countries under consideration, credibility of the monetary
authorities is not a serious issue.

by Persson, Persson and Svensson (1987), there exist very simple schemes

models.

case of redistribution effects),

The first implication of the theory is that income tax revenues and

to the random walk property of consumption derived by Hall (1978).

Empirical Evidence

Results from Previous Analysis
The insight that, in an environment like the one described above, the
inflation rate and the tax rate should be positively correlated, is the
basic idea behind recent analyses by lankiw (1987), and Poterba and

Rotemberg (1987).

lankiw (1987) argues that the theory of optimal

nominal
seigniorage performs reasonably well in explaining the behaviour of
interest rates and inflation in the postwar United States.

His conclusion

is based on the finding that the inflation rate (and the nominal interest
and that
rate) and the average tax rate are indeed positively correlated,
the regression coefficients are significant,

on the basis of the standard

T-statistics. Poterba and Rotemberg (1987), on the other hand, raise some
doubts about the generality of the theory.

They extend lankiw's analysis

to Japan, Germany, France and the U.K., and they find that a significant
positive correlation is present only in the Japanese data.
A fundamental problem with both analyses is that they do not take into

consideration the full range of empirical implications of the theory.

They

look only for a positive correlation between inflation and tax rate,but
they do not inquire about their unit root and cointegration properties.
tore importantly, the very nature of these properties,
inflation

i.e. the fact that

and taxes should have a unit root, may invalidate the kind of

tests used in those papers.

It is well known, in fact, that standard

regression techniques cannot be used in presence of non-stationary
variables. In general, the standard T-statistics do not have a limiting
distribution and cannot be used to test the significance of regression
coefficients.

In this case, the proper approach is to test for the

12

existence of cointegration aaong the non-stationary variables. We refer
the reader to Engle and Grenger (1987) for a discussion of the topic.
Our empirical analysis proceeds in two steps.

First, we test whether

the various measures of seigniorage and income taxes have a unit root,

a

necessary condition if a country is behaving according to the simple theory
outlined above.

Second,

we test for the existence of cointegration among

revenue variables and between revenues and expenditures.

All the data are

drawn from the International lonetary Fund International Financial
Statistics,

and are all in logarithms.

The sample size varies across

countries, and it is the longest possible in the period 1948- 1986.
Consequently, it varies from a maximum of 38 observations (for Ireland and
the U.K.) to a minimum of 22 (for Spain).

For all the other countries it

is between 30 and 35 observations. Expenditure and revenue data have been
expressed in real terms using the GDP deflator of the respective country.
In the Appendix we provide a more detailed description of the data sources.

Unit Root Tests
We conducted a variety of unit root tests, including tests proposed by
Dickey and Fuller (1979), Dickey and Fuller (1983), Phillips (1987) and
Phillips and Perron (1987).

Since the results of the different tests were

very similar, we report only the Za (Phillips (1987), the
(Phillips

and Perron (1987)) tests, which are presented in Table 3, Table 4

and Table 5.

The basic difference between the three tests is that the

test is designed for a pure autoregressive process, the

with a drift and time trend.

The exact form of the null hypotheses and of

the alternatives for these tests are given at the bottom of the tables.

Tests

In this section we test for the existence of cointegration between
siegniorage (inflation) and expenditures, and seigniorage (inflation) and
taxes.

Given the results of the unit root tests, including Denmark,

Ireland, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands

in the analysis may not be

appropriate. However, it is interesting to know whether the inflation rate
and the tax rate have moved in the same direction,

In fact, even if taxes are globally set at suboptimal levels,

it could be

the case that the relative weights of the different tax instruments are
still choosen according to the above theory.

For example, if a government

decides, (for reasons exogenous to our model) to set the taxes at levels
lower than what would be necessary to satisfy its budget constraint,

the

inflation rate and the income tax rate could be displaying a stationary
behavior.

Nonetheless, if it is using inflation for revenue purposes,

it

may still find it desirable to move the inflation rate and tax rate
together.

loreover, the unit root tests used above, as well as the

cointegration tests that we will be using below, are all asymptotic tests.
Therefore,

given the small sample size, the margin of error may be bigger

than the one based on asymptotic distributions.
In Table 6 we present the results of regressing total seigniorage on
total taxes, and total seigniorage on total government expenditure
(inclusive of interest payments).

Table 7 presents analogous results based

on the inflation rate, the tax rate and the expenditure rate.

Finally,

Table S reports the results of regressing total taxes on total expenditure,
and the tax rate on the expenditure rate.

Following the suggestion by

Engle and Granger (1987), the cointegration tests are based on the

15

Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF).

The critical values of the ADF test

are based on Phillips and Ouliaris (1987), where they derive the asymptotic
distribution of the test for a different number of right-hand variables.
Notice first, that the positive correlations between seigniorage and
taxes, seigniorage and expenditure, and taxes and expenditure are present
for all the ten countries. Also, on the basis of the standard
I-

statistics, these correlations are very significant. The same is true

for the correlations between inflation rate, tax rate, and expenditure

Even if these variables moved in

the hypothesis of cointegration for several of the countries.
On the basis of these tests, we can divide the ten countries

we can be more confident about the meaningfulness of the

consequence of the fact that the dependent variable is, indeed, stationary.

Another characteristic

that emerges from the analysis is that the regressions based on total

This is particularly true for Greece and Italy.

seigniorage has been an important revenue instrument,

Extensions of the Model

Variability in Velocity and in the Cost Functions
The above analysis assumed, in common with lankiw (1987), that

velocity is fixed over time.

Changes in velocity, however, might affect

17

the desirability of seigniorage as a source of revenue. In general, in
fact, it is optimal to have a higher level of seigniorage in periods of low
velocity.

Ignoring these movements in velocity may introduce bias in the

estimates. For example, increases

in seigniorage induced by increases

expenditure might have been offset by decreases induced by increases
velocity.

In equation (2.12), for example, this is equivalent to a

decrease in m.
As Table 9 shows, important changes in velocity occurred during the
period under investigation. Two distinct patterns emerge.

On the contrary,

Spain and Greece exhibit, if anything,

What is interesting is the almost identical composition of these two
groups and the groups based on the cointegration results. With the
exception of France, the countries that experienced a strong positive trend
in velocity are also the ones for which the cointegration properties are
absent.

Similarly, the countries for which the evidence of cointegration

was stronger,

are also the ones (with the exception of Spain) in which the

ratio of monetary base and output remained relatively high.
It is likely that the increase in velocity has induced a shift in the

possible,

These differences in reserve requirements are

at the moment, because of the existence of capital controls which

reduce the international competition among commercial banks.

The

unifications of the European capital markets, however, will require the
harmonization of these regulations.

At that point, the use of seigniorage

will be greatly compromised. Another strong hypothesis that is used to
obtain the relationship between seigniorage and taxes like (2.5) or (2.12),
is that the cost functions c1(.) and c2(.) have been assumed to be constant

over time.

Vhile it is difficult to model the way in which these cost

functions may have changed, we cannot rule out this possibility. By

loreover, if the process driving the relative cost (e.g.

in equation (2.5)) has a unit root, then by estimating it with a

This will lead to a failure to detect cointegration between seigniorage and
income tax revenues. A similar argument applies to equation (2.12) with
the addition that velocity

might also have been a unit root process.

Seigniorage vs. Fixed Exchange Rates
In our basic model, we implicitly assumed that the monetary

authorities were potentially free to choose any level of seigniorage.

19

This approach, however, fails to consider a crucial element in the
monetization decisions, i.e. the exchange rate regime.

In fact, a fixed

exchange rate system imposes serious constraints on the ability of
governments to independently set the level of inflation.

Given that a

country values a stable exchange rate, it may be willing to suffer the cost
of a suboptimal use of the inflation tax.

These are important

considerations since most of the observations in our data set refer to
Bretton-Voods first and the

periods of fixed or controlled exchange rates:
ENS later on.

A simple way to model this idea is to introduce

into the government

loss function an additional term which penalizes the variance of inflation

In this respect, the experience of

Germany and the U.K. is very revealing.

In both cases, the positive

correlation between seigniorage and taxes disappears. This can be
interpreted as an

indication of the priority of exchange rate policies over seigniorage
policies in these two countries.

Solvency and Fiscal Reforms

Could we then conclude that seigniorage is not a serious threat to exchange

of view is that it neglects to consider the current status of the various

several of the countries in our sample are not following fiscal policies

which are sustainable in the long run.

Sooner or later these countries

will have to undertake budget adjustments which may well involve resorting
to seigniorage revenues.

While it is true that inflation does not need to

be part of a fiscal reform, the existence of domestic political constraints
on the use of alternative sources of revenues may make seigniorage
indispensable.

In this section we present results of econometric tests designed to
determine whether the idea that some European countries are following
potentially insolvent fiscal policies, is indeed founded.
Consider the government budget constraint at time

This is the usual condition which says that the stock of debt cannot
increase faster than the government borrowing rate.

Condition (3.3)

implies, as noted by IcCallum (1984), and Hamilton and Flavin (1986), that
a constant deficit inclusive of interest payments is consistent with

where K is the constant size of the deficit, so that condition (3.3) is
satisfied. Hamilton and Flavin (1986) test the intertemporal budget
constraint for the U.S. in the period 1962-84.

Using a deterministic

bubble test of the kind proposed by Flood and Garber (1980), they conclude
that the US "government budget historically has been balanced in expected
present value terms" (p. 809).
lore recently, Trehan and Valsh (1987) have employed a similar test,
closer in spirit to the ones employed in the previous sections of this
paper.

The intuition behind this test is quite simple.

Under this condition,

Trehan and Valsh (1987) show that the necessary and sufficient condition
for the budget to be intertemporallybalanced is that the first difference
of the stock of debt, i.e. the deficit inclusive of interest payments, is
stationary.

They also test this condition for the U.S., on a longer sample

than Hamilton and Flavin (1986), and they reach the same conclusion.
Table 11 presents the unit root tests for the deficits of the ten
European countries. The non- stationarity of the deficit is rejected only
for the U.K. and, at a lower level of confidence, for Germany and possibly
Denmark.

For the other countries, this analysis suggests that the current

budget policies will have to be revised if intertemporal balance has
guaranteed.

Even if, given the small sample size, these results should be

interpreted with caution, they definitely indicate that for
countries the temptation to repudiate their European commitments, even by
markets or by abandoning the defense
reintroducing controls on the capital
of their exchange rate parity, may become very strong.

24

Conclusions and Policy Implications
In this paper, based on the experience of ten European countries,

we

tried to understand the relevance of seigniorage revenues in the recent
past, and speculate about their importance in the near future.

A first

conclusion is that the members of the European Community differ widely in
the way they manage monetary policies.

we divided the countries

At a first level of approximation,
For the first group, composed of

into two groups.

Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.K., we could not
identify a consistent seigniorage policy.
the second group (France,

Ireland,

Italy, Germany and Greece), seigniorage
component

of their financing policies.

This lack of consensus about the role of monetary policies is a potential
source of conflict in designing common exchange rate policies.
A formal analysis of the current status of the finances of the
governments of the ten European countries revealed that several of them are
now following budget policies that are potentially incompatible with their
long run solvency.

This also represents a major obstacle toward monetary

unification on exchange rate stability.

lember countries will be faced

with quite different needs for revenues and eliminating a (politically)
flexible instrument like seigniorage may result in an unstable situation.
This problem is likely to become more acute in the near future since, with
the dismantling of capital controls, other forms of taxation which

intrinsically depended on the segmentation of capital markets, will have to
disappear. In the periods of social conflict which are likely to
characterize times of fiscal reforms, the temptation to resort to
seigniorage and thus either reintroduce capital controls or abandon the
exchange rate parity, may become very strong.

25

What is going to be the future of the exchange rate system in Europe?
In what direction should we move? One possibility is the return to a free
float.

Recent experience,

however,

has generated widespread skepticism

about the desirability of such an arrangement.

There exists a fear that

movements of the nominal exchange rate are dominated by speculative
bubbles, and thus that they may induce market responses that are unrelated
to economic fundamentals.

It is contended that a higher exchange rate

variability may also induce inefficiencies in the allocation of resources.
IcKinnon (1988), for example, argues that in a world where markets are
highly incomplete,

forward markets alone cannot provide sufficient

insurance against exchange rate risk, especially for long term irreversible
investments.

But, more fundamentally, a return to a free float

is in

contradiction with the goal of a European monetary unification.
Another extreme possibility is the switch to an irrevocable fixed
exchange rate system.

At the moment, however, there do not seem to exist

the proper conditions for a tightening of the EIS bands and for the
implementation of a strictly fixed exchange rate system.

During the next

few years, the top priority of several member countries will be the
correction of their public finances.

This will probably involve major

adjustments in their fiscal and monetary policies.
Practicable fiscal adjustments may require several realignments in the
exchange rate parities.

has been suggested by Grilli and

This would involve the expansion of the inter-country

credit facilities and the formal commitment to large short term loans to
central banks who come under the danger of a speculative attack.

The title of this section was inspired by the title of lundell (1973).

Even if not done here, it is possible to derive these type of cost
function from more fully specified general equilibrium models. See Grilli

(1988).
3

See Trehan and Valch (1987) for a formal derivation.

4
Different measures of seigniorage can be found in the literature. The
most common are the inflation rate multiplied by real cash balances, the
rate of growth of monetary base multiplied by real cash balances, and the
nominal interest rate multiplied by real cash balances. Drazen (1985),
provides a general measure of seigniorage which produces most of the
popular measures as special cases.

Equations are not exactly true since, in general, Cov(rt, y1) and
are not zero.
