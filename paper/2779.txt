Introduction
Bequest constraints have played a major role in discussions of

Barro's (1974) debt-neutrality theorem.

In his famous article (1974),

Barro showed that if finite-lived parents left their descendants positive
bequests in the absence of government debt, the introduction of public
debt would not affect parents' optimal consumption plans and would not
create new opportunities to transfer resources from parents to children.
Barro's proposition thus requires an interior solution or the absence of
nonnegativity constraints on bequests.

Subsequent developments of this

subject have focused on the implications of such nonnegativity constraints
and the possibility of boundary solutions; see Drazen (1978), Kimball
(1987), Weil (1987),

and Abel (1988).

This literature focused mainly on

the positive economics aspects of institutional constraints on bequests

and their implications for government debt neutrality.

In this paper we focus on the welfare implications of bequest
constraints within the framework of endogenous fertility developed in
Nerlove, Razin and Sadka (1987).

Gary Becker and Kevin Murphy (1988)

pointed out the importance of bequest constraints when family decisions
(such as fertility, investment in human capital, etc.) are endogenous, as
a source of market failure,

for public policies.

In an early paper (1984)

and subsequently in our book (Nerlove et al (1987, Chapter 8)) we dealt
with a similar issue:

the welfare implications of institutional

constraints implying the inability of parents to force transfers among
their children, who have different ability to make use of human capital.

-2-

When children have different abilities, so that investments in their human
capital are not equally productive, and parents cannot enforce transfers
among them, an egalitarian parental attitude may lead to inefficient
investment in human and nonhuman capital.

For example, the parents may he

led to invest too much in the human capital of the low-ability children so
that they will be equal (in the productivity of their human capital) to
their more able siblings.

The resulting market failure is shown to be

alleviated by a tax on earned income and a subsidy to bequest.
In this paper, we concinue this line of analysis dealing with the
diseconomies associated with institutional constraints on the family by
focusing on the implications of bequest constraints for the
intergenerational distribution of welfare when no differences exist among
children. We examine several potential welfare-improving policies
designed to correct institutional constraints to negative bequests and the
implications of such policies for population growth.

Among such

policies, we consider a social security scheme.
In his pioneering paper, Samuelson (1958) pointed out to the role of
government debt (money) as a social contrivance for improving
intertemporal allocations of resources within generations. A social
security scheme by which each young generation pays a tax to finance a
t:ransfer to the old generation can, of course, play a similar role.

This

role is limited to intra-generational transfers, because in the original
Samuelson's

In the context of intergenerational altruism, social

security can also play a role of intergenerational transfers.

on bequests.

such as a subsidy to human capital investment,

are shown to be welfare-reducing because they introduce further
distortions into the economy without playing any role for

The paper is organized in the following manner.

potential market failure arising from the institutional constraints on
bequests.

parent's point of view).

II.

Bequest-Constrained Equilibrium
To highlight the economic mechanism underlying the problem at

hand we use a simple stylized model.

Suppose there are only two periods,

two generations and a single all-purpose composite good.

The first

generation consists of identical individuals (parents) who live for one
period.

Each parent is endowed with I units of the composite good.

She

-4-

consumes c1 units of the composite good in the first period and bears

n

identical children who each possesses one unit of adult labor in the
second period.
Investing e units of the single good in the first period in the
education of a child augments her labor supply, as measured in efficiency
units, to g(e).

We assume that the marginal product of human capital is

positive but diminishing, i.e.:

(1)

0.

g' > 0, g" <

The child then earns wg(e) in the second period where w is the wage rate
per efficiency unit. Without loss of generality we henceforth set w—l.
The parent can also bequeath b units of the composite good to each child
in the first period.

the

economy (via the government) can borrow in the present from abroad at the
rate of interest R-l and repay the loan in the second period.

Thus,

Therefore, there may be a market failure in the intertemporal allocation

nonnegativity constraint on bequests (3).

We call the solution to this

optimization problem, (c1*,n*,c2*,b*,e*), the laissez-faire equilibrium.
When the institutional constraint is not binding, namely

it is straightforward to

see that the parent invests in the human capital of each child up to the
point where the marginal productivity of human capital is equal to the
rate of interest:
(6) g'(e*) — R.

The rate-of-return equalization ensures efficiency in the choice between
human and nonhuman (physical)

capital as means of transferring resources

from the present to the future.

Notice that this efficiency rule is

obtained independently of the optimal choice of c1,n,b and c2.

(Of

chosen.)
However, this efficiency rule no longer holds when the nonnegativity
bequest constraint is binding. In the latter case b* — 0 and (6) becomes:

This implies by (1) that investment in human capital is insufficient.

The

parent would have liked to invest more in the human capital of her
children if she could keep some of the return to this investment to
herself by borrowing from her children.

But thu

would have required b to

be negative which is institutionally iwpossible. In this paper we focus
on this bequest constrained equilibrium (b* —

0).

There are several key factors which determine whether the bequest
constraint is binding or not; see also Abel (1988).

In contrast to the parent, the economy is not constrained by (3).
The optimum for the economy is obtained by maximizing the utility function

Obviously not only investment in human capital is distorted in the
laissez-faire equilibrium due to the institutional constraint on bequests
but also all other choice variables (c1,n, and c2) are distorted.

Notice that our concept of optimality here is considered from the
parent's point of view, namely,

the optimal allocation maximizes the

parent's utility function (subject to the economy's resource constraints).

III.

Optimum versus Laissez-Faire: A Pareto Comparison
As indicated in the preceding section, parent altruism toward

children does not necessarily imply that the optimal allocation dominates
in the Pareto sense the laissez-faire allocation. Namely, although the

-8-

parent's utility is, by definition, greater at the optimum than at the
laissez-faire, children utility (consumption)

may be smaller.

To see the

factors at play in the movement from the laissez-faire to the optimal
allocation and, in particular, their effect on children consumption, let
us consider a simplified version of our model in which the number of
children n is exogenous.
Notice that b is equal to zero at the laissez-faire allocation and
becomes negative at the optimal allocation. Therefore, to analyze the
difference between the laissez-faire and the optimal consumption per
child, let us parameterize b and consider the effect on c2 of lowering b
from zero to its optimal level.

Thus, the real income

as by itself, enhances Pareto-improvement,when moving from the

laissez-faire to the optimum.
The second term in the expression for dä2/db is unambiguously
positive.

It stems from the fact that relaxing the bequest constraint

allows the parent to provide less consumption for each one of her
children.

Thus, the second term tends, as by itself,

to lower the utility

of children in the optimal allocation, making the laissez-faire and the

utility is higher in the optimal allocation than in the laissez-faire
allocation:

The optimal allocation Pareto-dominates the laissez-faire

allocation.

On the other hand, if the real income effect is relatively

small, the two allocations are Pareto-noncomparable.

The above analysis was carried out under the assumption that the
number of children is exogenous. However,

it should be clear that the

same factors are at work when n is endogenous.

Indeed,

the children

utility may well be lower in the optimum than in the laissez-faire also
when n is endogenous. Appendix B provides such an example.

-

The Effect of the Beouest Constraint on Population Growth
As was already mentioned earlier, a binding bequest constraint

forces parents to underinvest in the human capital of their children.

It

may seem that this distortion will induce parents to bring an inadequate
number of children (i.e., n*

< n**),

because they face a binding limit on

the "financing" of children.
This may indeed be the case.

The loss of utility due to the

institutional constraint on bequest may lead to a smaller number of
children in the laissez-faire solution relative to the optimum.

To gain

some insight into the effects determining the difference between the
number of children in the two allocations, observe that the laissez-faire
allocation with a binding bequest constraint can be represented as a
solution to the following problems:
max u*(c1,n)
(8)

(c1,n)
s.t.

:

—
c1 + ne*

where u*(c1,u) —

u(c1,n,g(e*)).

The optimal allocation can be represented as a solution to the following
problem:
max u**(c1,n)
(9)

c1+n(e**+b**)I,

where u**(cl,n) —

u(c,n,g(e**) + b**R).

In both (8) and (9) only c1 and

n

are the choice variables, while

investment in human capital (e) and bequest

(b)

are set at their

predetermined solution levels (e* and b* — 0 for the laissez-faire
allocation;

in the budget constraint is different. The

laissez-faire solution is suboptimal because the transfer of resources
from parents to children cannot be efficiently channeled via physical and
human capital investments. If the removal of the constraint on the
efficient allocation of investment between human and physical capital
leads to a larger total yield (i.e., c2* —

then it is

plausible that the laissez-faire rate of population growth is too slow
(i.e., n* <

To see this, refer to Figure 1.

The laissez-faire

budget constraint AR' is steeper than the optimal budget constraint AR'
because the laissez-faire price of children is larger than the optimal
price of children (e* >

If an increase in the quality of

favor of number of the children (which is plausible) then the indifference
curves corresponding to u** are steeper than those corresponding to u*.
If furthermore u** implies that the number of children is not a Giffen
good, then the optimal allocation must yield a larger number of children

than the laissez-faire allocation.
However, this is not always true.

In fact, the existence of the non-

negativity constraint on bequest might have forced the parent to allow
more consumption per child than otherwise desired. Hence, the removal of
the constraint will, in this case,

lower the consumption per child, i.e.

c2** —

investment is more efficiently channelled in the optimum, this will

a smaller total investment in the optimum: e** +

e*.

If,

as before,, the decline in the quality of children changes preferences in
(c1, n)-space against number of children,

then the indifference curves

corresponding to u** are flatter than those corresponding to u* (see
Figure 2).

In this case, the optimal allocation can be either to the

right or to the left of point D, shoving that the optimal number of
children can be either smaller or larger than the laissez-faire number of
children. Appendix B presents an example in which the optimal number of
children is indeed smaller than the laissez-faire number of children.
V.

Corrective Policies
The source of the market failure in the presence of an institutional

constraint on negative bequests is the inability of parents to transfer
resources from their heirs to themselves.
to have an efficient number of children,

Such a transfer enables parents
to invest efficiently in their

human capital and makes parents and, possibly, each one of their children
better off.2

A

first-best remedy to this market failure may seem to be a per-

parent subsidy in the first period debt-financed by a head tax on children
in the second period.

However, notice that when fertility is endogenous

(as is the case here), a head tax on children is not neutral, because it

affects the "price" of children,

and thereby distorts parents' behavior,

In the absence of genuine second-period lump-sum taxes we therefore
examine second.best corrective policies.

Such policies are aimed to raise

the parent's utility beyond the laissez-faire level, but they cannot

attain the first-best level.

The government, which can lend and borrow also over periods in which

Thus, (19) implies that a small income tax (in the second period)
which is financed by a first-period lump-ium subaidy (a negative T) is
welfare improving.

This is a sort of an old age social security scheme.

The rationale for this result is as follows. On the one hand

such a

policy transfers resources from the children to the parent and thereby

welfare.

On the other

However, this distortionary

since

in general a small tax has

only a second-order effect on welfare around the laissez-faire
equilibrium.

Therefore, a second-period income tax with a first-period

lump-sum subsidy increases welfare. Interestingly, an income tax is
justified here on pure efficiency grounds rather than on the more
conventional redistribution grounds. We also drew a similar conclusion in
Nerlove et al.

(1984, 1987, Chapter 8) in the context of differential

ability of children.
As should be clear from the analysis of section III, since the parent
is altruistic, a policy which enhances the parent's welfare may improve

the children's welfare as well.

Indeed,

employing similar methods to

-

As in section

the income effect works in

c:

the direction of increasing c2; but the second term reflects the desire of
the parent to lower c2, as the bequest constraint is effectively relaxed.
4hen the income effect is relatively strong, the social security scheme is
Pareto-improving.
Equations (17) and (18) imply that a small education subsidy and a
child allowance have no first-order effects on welfare.

This is obvius

since they do not play any role in intertemporal redistributions (since
they are financed by a lump-sum tax in the same period) and their
distortionary effect on welfare is, as in general, only of a second-order
magnitude.

Furthermore, due to this lack of any intertemporal

distribution role, one can show that a finite education subsidy/tax or a
finite child allowance/tax reduce welfare. To see this, observe that the
parent's choices of ci, n, c2, and e in the presence of s, a and T
satisfy the budget constraints:

the government's budget constraint in this case is

it follows from (20) and (22) that
C1(s,a,0,T) +

(23)

N(s,a,0,T)E(s,a,0,T)<I.

Thus, the bundle chosen in the presence of s,a, and T is affordable under

the laissez-faire budget constraints (compare (23) and (21) with (2) and
(4), respectively).

Therefore, an education tax or subsidy and a child

allowance or tax, financed by a first-period iump-sum tax or subsidy
cannot possibly increase welfare.

Such taxes or subsidies will usually

reduce welfare.
V.

Coriclusion3

When institutional constraints to the transfer of resources from
children to their parents exists, welfare of the parents' generation may
be improved by some sort of an old age social security scheme:

a luxnp-suiu

subsidy to parents, financed by debt creation to be paid by the revenues
from an income tax on children.

Such an income tax is justified not by

income redistribution considerations, as is typically the case, but
rather on pure efficiency grounds. Due to its intergenerational-transfer
role, the social security scheme is Pareto-improving with altruistic

parents if, in addition,

the real income effect which tends to raise

children consumption is relatively strong.

If the model is extended to an

infinite overlapping generations model, the social security will not only
tax children when they are young but will also subsidize them when they
are old.

In such a setup, social security is more likely to be Pareto-

improving.

corrective measures such as subsidies to parents'

welfare reducing.
We also explore the implication of such a corrective policy for the
children welfare and for the rate of population growth.

We identified a

feature which can make this policy to improve the welfare of children.
This feature is a strong real income effect on children consumption.
Intuition suggests that population growth will be greater when bequest
constraints are eliminated,

or ameliorated.

However, this is not

necessarily the case due to income effects and because of the trade-offs
between numbers and welfare of children are altered.

A

In this appendix we describe a simple closed economy with overlapping
generations in which a parent is constrained in her ability to transfer
resources from the future back to the present, while the society is not.
Suppose an individual, whom we call Eve, lives for three periods.

Eve is

born in the first period in which she receives an education from her
parents and inherits b

0 from them at the end of this period.

Now consider the third period of Eve's life.

In this period also a

person from another generation, Adam, who was born in the previous period,
is alive.

Adam is in the second period of his life in which he works and

can save.

Thus,

the society can transfer resources in the third period of

Eve's life from Adam to her.

Next period, Eve's children will be in the

their lives and society can transfer

In this way, society is able to

transfer resources indirectly from Eve's children to herself (via Adam).
Eve, herself, cannot make such a transfer due to the nonnegativity

constraint on bequests.

Footnotes

1.

A similar distinction between the intertemporal constraint faced by

the individual and by the economy exists also in a closed-economy when

generations overlap (see Appendix A).
2.

As shown in Section III, maximizing the altruistic parent's utility

will lead also to a higher children utility if the real income effect on
c2, arising from the effective relaxation of the bequest constraint,

is

relatively strong; see below.
3.

Since first-period income is exogenous, them an income tax in the

first period is essentially a non-distortionary lump-sum tax.

4.

As in Section III, n is assumed exogenous in the derivation of

dc2/dt.
