Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to provide an exposition in a familiar

setting of some new methods in asset pricing and to indicate some aspects
of the extension of these methods to the open economy. While the paper is
designed as an exposition of these new ideas, the fiscal policies studied
in Section III may be applicable to discussions of the asset-market
effects of recent U.S. fiscal policy efforts.
The paper builds on some work by Andrew Abel (1986) on obtaining
closed-form asset pricing formulas for a model environment where agents
understand correctly that the nature of risk is time-varying.

j/

In

particular, Abel's work was the first that allowed time-varying dividend
riak and obtained explicit closed-form pricing formulas for a representative-agent asset-pricing model where agent preferences display constant
relative risk aversion.
Researchers have often described asset markets as being characterized
by periods of turbulence and periods of tranquility. Before Abel's work,
however, we were unable to study explicitly agents' reactions to new
information about the riskiness of the asset pricing environment in a
framework of a well-specified time-series model of tranquility and turbulence.

reactions to inconceivable once-and-for-all shifts in higher

moments.

These shifts are inconceivable because the models are solved

Others who have adopted and extended the Able model include

models and can therefore price assets in nominal terms. In Appendix II,
some aspects of nominal asset pricing are discussed.

typically conditionally on the agents supposing that relevent higher
moments are assuredly constant through time.

Researchers then study the

effects of risk chsnges by changing moments (apparently forever) in a
pricing formula constructed under the assumption that such moments would
never change.

The asset market applicability of the study of such miracu-

lous events is unclear.
If risk, in some sense, changes through time then one way to model
explicitly intertemporal variations in the risk environment is by making

rik

the outcome of a stochastic process.

The advantage to adopting an

explicit stochastic process for risk is that a stochastic process is
useful for separating shocks to the risk environment from predictable
changes in the risk environment. Since it is the agents' reactions to
their understanding of the time variation in risk that provides the link
between the risk environment and asset prices we should model carefully
the formation of agents' beliefs about the current and future riskiness of
their environment.
Abel studies risk as a time-series process asauming representative
agents with rational expectations,

constant-relative-risk-aversionperiod

utility functions and assuming a particular functional form for
distribution functions generating the underlying shocks.

This paper will

study agents' reactions to shocks in the time-series process generating
their stochastic environment without assuming a representative agent and
without making particular functional form distributional assumptions.
fact,

In

in this model the stochastic environment enters the rational

expectations problem in a very familiar way and obtaining explicit closed-

-3-

form solutions requires only a minor extension of the now well-know method
of linear undetetermined coefficients.
In order to simplify the analysis some of Able's assumptions are
changed.

For clarity, the simplest assumption set has been chosen.

In

making the assumption substitutions, however, a possibly important aspect
of decision making may be lost.

In particular,

it is assumed that time-

separable quadratic preferences are capable of capturing adequately the
consumption-saving decision facing agents.

Given this approximation it is

simple to obtain closed-form asset pricing functions for a wide range of
distribution functions for the exogenous variables without assuming that
individual agents are very similar aside from the functional form of
preferences. While the quadratic preferences assumption buys a lot of
simplicity it also coats something in terms of a possibly important dimension of risk aversion.

With quadratic period utility, agents are risk

averse with respect the risks involving the returns on their asset holding
but they are risk neutral with respect to the riskiness of the underlying
environment. Quadratic preferences induce linearity in the second moments
(or variancea) of returns.

This linearity is the source of much of the

simplicity of the present approach.
The paper is divided into four additional sections.

In Section II

the basic asset pricing model is developed for an infinitely lived

representative agent inhabiting a world with time-varying risk.

Two

simple experi- menta ("warm-upa") are conducted in this section to
familiarize the reader with the asset-price solution algorithm. The warmups are chosen to illustrate simply environments that might be encountered
in practice. In the first example,

dividend risk moves exogenously and is

-4unconnected to any other aspect of market fundamentals.

In the second

example the dividend risk is modelled as a function of past disturbances
to dividends.

In Section 1111 the model is subjected to two kinds of

fiscal policy experiments. The first fiscal experiment studies how fiscal
feedback policy (from the level of output) influences the asset market
impact of

a

shift in the riskiness of the environment. The second fiscal

experiment studies the asset market effect of entering a period of "fiscal
reform".

Section IV contains some concluding remarks.

Real Asset Pricing Model

assets in a hypothetical world that functions without money.

is assumed that a family of representative agents inhabits a closed
economy where output is exogenous, government is absent.

Preferences are

j/ Quadratic utility is objectionable to some--apparently on aesthetic
grounds. It is sometimes mentioned that any fixed-psrameter quadratic
utility function will eventually be "out grown" by an economy growing
without bound. Another way of phrasing this objection is to say that
attention should be restricted to model environments where per-capita
consumption can grow without bound. This seems to me to be a singularly
unworldly restriction.
Another line of attack on quadratic utility is that other utility
functions such as constant relative (or constant sbsolute) risk aversion
seem a priori "more plausible". Such a point is, of course, unarguable.
One can argue, however, that since empirical work on the stock market
(e.g., Flood, Hodrick, and Kaplan (1987)) rejects many popular period
utility functions including constant relative riak aversion, constant
absolute risk aversion, risk neutrality and quadratic utility there is no
way to choose among the popular forms on the basis of conformity with the
data.
Consequently, for studies like the current one it seems sensible to
adopt the utility function which makes exposition as transparent as
possible--quadratic utility.
One objection to quadratic period utility which should not be dismissed is that quadratic period utility implies risk neutrality with
respect to the riskiness of the environment. As was mentioned in the text
this is the technical source of this paper's simplicity.

Government Policy and Asset Prices

In this section the model developed above will be used to study two
issues.

First, how does government expenditure policy influence the way

changes in an the economy's stochastic environment impact the asset
market?

Second,

how does the asset market react to entering a period of

likely fiscal reform?

The concept of likely fiscal reform

is,

characterized here by an upward shift in the covariance of innovations in
government spending and innovations in the income tax rate.

This

definition of fiscal reform does not take a stand on the direction of
movement of tax rates or government expenditure;

it considers only the

association between government spending changes and tax rate changes.
While the questions studied in this section have some independent interest
they were chosen to illustrate some aspects of the model.

The first

question is chosen to illustrate the asset pricing effect of the
interaction of first moment and variance processes and the second is

1/ Examining equation (6), it is clear that while the present approach
is helpful for examining the impact of underlying risk shifts on asset
price, it is no big help in examining the effects of underlying volatility
shifts on asset-price volatility. The problem is that to convert to asset
price one must divide zt by the marginal utility of consumption. Since
this marginal utility will in equilibrium involve the level of output, the
conversion to asset price from Zt involves dividing by a linear function
of a stochastic disturbance. Asset price is therefore, in this set up, a
nonlinear function of the underlying disturbances. Studying the
volatility of asset price usually requires that the expectation of asset
price be calculated. Such calculations for nonlinear functions are
distribution-function specific and will be avoided here.

chosen to illustrate the adaptability of this kind of model to studying
time series processes involving the covariance.
This section uses the closed-economy equity-pricing model introduced
earlier.

The closed economy is a useful fiction here since income tax

rates need not be uniform across countries.

Without uniform taxes agents

need not face the same effective prices, making aggregation much more
difficult than is the case presently.

Introducing the government

equilibrium conditions be modified. It is assumed that the government

question with our tools, "fiscal reform" must be a recurring event with
agents understanding the time series process of fiscal reforms.

For an economy to move into a surprising period of fiscal

The fiscal reform model

used here is cynical in that nothing ever happens to the means of percapita government spending and the income tax rate.

This is intended only

as an analytical convenience allowing separation of the riskiness of a
fiscal reform period from the type of reform expected.

that the present idea of fiscal reform deals only with the

coordination of tax and spending policies.

It is eclectic with respect to

the direction of change of both spending and the tax rate.

fiscal reform is therefore a period when the tax rate and per-capita
spending are likely to move in the same direction.

Concluding Remarks

The purpose of this paper was to exposit and apply in a simple and
familiar framework some ideas developed recently by Abel.

This line of

research allows us for the first time to ask in a consistent way questions
concerning agents'

reactions to predictable and unpredictable alterations

in the riskiness of their environment. The framework seems to have wide
potential applicability to problems such as options pricing and optimal
government stabilization policy where the nature of and reactions to timevarying risk are at the center of the problem.

APPENDIX II

of Nominal Asset Pricing

The model developed in the text was designed to allow pricing of

assets in real terms in a hypothetical world that functions without money.
One is interested, however,

in nominal asset pricing since nominal units

are the typical units of real-world asset pricing.

While

it is outside

the direct realm of this paper, this appendix gives an example of asset

pricing in a nominal environment where risk may be time-varying.
Money is introducedvia the simplest mechanism available in the

it is assumed that agents must

It is also assumed that when the money is

acquired by agents, the agents know exactly the quantity of goods that
they will purchase with the money.

Later a somewhat looser version of a

Glower-constrainedmodel will be discussed.
Accommodating money in our model requires that we reset budget constraints.

In particular, it is assumed that all money enters (leaves) the

model via lump-sum transfers (taxes) from
government,

(to)

the government.

The

which takes no role in this economy other than provider of

money, has a budget constraint given by

money price of goods and Mt is the per-capita money stock.
The private individual now must obey a pair of constraints, the first
tonstraining his purchases of asset and the second constraining his purchases of goods.

This is natural in a cash-in-advance

economy since only

goods carry the special condition that they must be purchased with money.
The constraints are:

If quadratic utility is

the first two moments of the Yt+l distribution will be important

in determining the nominal interest rate.

For other utility function

choices other moments will enter the pricing function.
To the extent that money is exogenous to the private sector we have
much less economic guidance when calculating Etnt+l.

The problem is that

we have no way of knowing offhand what mathematical function of money is
being given a distribution function by the policy authorities.

ut

where

ut is white and has some known distribution. Since agents need to
calculate Ecnt÷l they must calculate MtEt(l/Mt÷l) and if a distribution is
given for ut÷l then aspects of that distribution function must be invoked
in the calculation and, in general, the calculation will be a function of
the entire shape of the distribution function.
For the above reason moments of the money supply rule other than
those typically considered important for nominal interest rates might
entet a reduced-form interest rate function,

Df course there is no good

reason for the authorities to adopt a distribution pertaining to the level
of money.

The monetary authority could make agents' calculations a lot

easier if they were to adopt a rule on gt÷l,

would enter the nominal

interest rate reduced form.
The reader may have noticed that the above methods for introducing
unusual moments of the monetary disturbance into the interest rate reduced
form are essentially unrelated to the asset pricing framework.

These

moments are being introduced by the model's requiring agents to form
expectations of nonlinear functions of the policy variables.

For the same

reasons these moments could turn up in standard descriptive macro-models.
Suppose, for example, that agents are following a log-linear macro-model.
The solution of the model (e.g.

,

for

the interest rate)

might require the

model's agents to form expectations of future logs of money.

If the

policy authority is following money-supply a rule on the level of money
with an additive shock then descriptions of the distribution of that shock

-25-

&EfENDIXII

(possibly including higher moments of the distribution) will appear in the
reduced form expressions for the endogenous variables.
A much more interesting area of study is suggested by the term ut in
(A2.5).

Through this term the covariance of a monetary variable, nt+l,

and a real variable, gt+l,

can influence the nominal rate of interest.

Similar covariance terms have been an important topic in macroeconomics
since its inception.
The model used in this appendix was adopted for ease of discussion.
Essentially the same points apply in the cash-in-advance models of the
type used by Hodrick (1987) and Giovannini (1987) where money must be
gathered before the resolution of other aspects of the period's
uncertainty.

This alteration in the timing of the resolution of

uncertainty simply alters the timing of variables entering the interest
rate reduced form.

Heterogenous Agent. Multi-Country Reinterpretation
The analysis in the text was based on a representative-agent closed
economy model to facilitate comparisons with other work in that setting.
The purpose of this appendix is to show that the model we have used has a
much broader interpretation than we have placed on it.

Indeed we will

find that once quadratic period utility has been assumed, aggregation in a
world of heterogenous agents is straightforward.
In a world where agents from different countries are endowed with
different wealth levels and have different period utility functions but
where each agent has quadratic period utility, each agent faces the
following problem:

The symbols in the above problem retain moat of their previous meaning,
but now symbols with a j superscript apply only to individual j, where
j —

l,2,3,...J.
It is not necessary to make any special assumptions about the country

of location of the individuals for asset pricing. ]j

However, certain

assumptions are required for simple aggregation. First, all agents use
the same expectation operator; information is therefore homogenous across
j/ Of course locating agents by country would be crucial for countrybookeeping such as current account, capital accounts, etc.

Third, all agents face identical prices for goods and assets.

fi,

The parameters in the period utility function and individual wealtha
can differ across individuals. As before, however, constant terms in the
period utility functions have been ignored and each individual's period
utility function has been normalized by dividing the function by 1/2 of
the parameter attached to (cj)2.

Individual period-utility-function

differences are therefore contained entirely in the parameters a).
Each individual's optimization problem will imply an Euler equation
like equation (1) in the text.

Average these equation across individuals

If all output is paid out as dividends we obtain an Euler equation very
similar to (3a) in the text.

The only difference between (A3.l) and (3a)

is that in (A3.l), the Euler equation parameter derived from the period
utility functions is the average across j of the constant terms in
individual period marginal utility while m in (3a) is the representative
agent's constant term in period marginal utility.
This implies that the results in the previous section are not very
sensitive to the closed economy representative agent assumption.
