Furthermore,

A final issue here involves the fact that both starting and current

of a standard deviation.

These sizable effects of previous experience and tenure on productivity
therefore

stand in sharp contrast to the results of Medoff and Abraham, who

found negative effects of experience

The estimates of Tables 4 and 5 might therefore be

viewed as lower bounds to the true effects of productivity on wages and on the
wage—tenure relationship. Furthermore, the similarities between productivity
effects on wages and experience in equations for levels and these for changes
again suggest that the subjective productivity scores used in the analysis
here are meaningful as measures of worker performance.

Comclmsfom
This

paper

uses

data from a nationwide sample of firms on employee

and characteristics to reexamine the determinants of employee

productivity and earnings.

Productivity is measured by subjective

productivity ratings of recently hired workers by their employers.

The

primary determinants of productivity and earnings that we consider are
enployee experience and tenure, hours of training, pay incentive schemes, and
various demographics characteristics of workers.

Wage and productivity score

equations are estimated in changes as well as levels to eliminate job— and
firm—specific factors in these productivity scores.
The results show that both previous experience and current job tenure
have positive and significant effects on wages and productivity.

We also find that hours spent in training have positive effects on both
wage and productivity changes, though productivity levels suggest that less
initially productive workers may receive more hours of training than do their
counterparts,

within firms.

The various pay incentive

schemes,

which

generally have large positive effects on wage levels and changes, do not have
similar positive effects on productivity levels or changes.
Finally, we find various other effects of individual and firm
characteristics. In particular,

slightly higher as well.

These results

contrast to their relative wage levels, which are significantly higher for
men.

The evidence

that higher wages for male workers reflect discrimination

is therefore strengthened.

We also find positive effects of unionism on

productivity scores of workers,

though in percentage terms these effects are

much smaller than are the effects of unionism on wages.

A

few caveats must be kept in mind as these results are reviewed.

The

exact nature and meaning of the subjective productivity score variable remain

questionable, and this unusual sample of young and inexperienced workers must
be noted as well. Still, the results here strongly suggest that wages are
affected by a wide range of both productivity— and non—productivity—related
factors, including

discrimination and unionism.

FOOTNOTES

1The seminal

piece

in the literature which stresses the productivity—

enhancing effect of experience is Mincer (1974).

But more recent theoretical

formulations stress that profit—maximizing firms may choose earnings profiles
that are steeper than productivity profiles with respect to experience (e.g.,
Lazear (1979)).
A somewhat different question has recently been raised about whether
the returns to job tenure really reflect differences in "match quality" across

people and jobs as opposed to a return to tenure for people on the same jobs
(Abraham and Farber, 1987).

If, in fact, those with longer tenure have higher

quality matches, we would expect to see higher productivity among those with
longer tenure.
2Maranto and Rodgers find that the experience of government

officials

in monitoring firm compliance with minimum wage laws raises their productivity

in uncovering violations.

Brown finds that most of the wage—tenure profile is

explained by the time which individuals

report that it takes for them to

complete training and become fully productive on their jobs.
3Frank analyzes the distributions of sales and earnings among
automobile dealers and realtors, finding a narrower spread in the latter than
the former.

Klein et. al. and Weiss use data on output for production workers

at a large firm to analyze the effects of gender and high school graduation on
observed output and quits.

Another strand of this literature analyzes the

union effect on productivity and compares it with the wage effect.
growing literature is summarized in Freeman and Medoff (1984).

This

4Lazear and Brown present theoretical arguments

on firm choice between

straight time and incentive pay, and Brown provides empirical evidence as
well.

Seiler and Weiss pr?vide evidence that individual incentives (relative

to straight time pay or group incentives) raises the variance of earnings
across individual workers and infer effort/output effects from this.

Research on Vocational Education and administered by Gallup, Inc.

Federal government were $2.90 in 1979, 3.10 in 1980, and 3.35 in 1981.

12The youthfulness and low experience levels of the sample reflect not
only its focus on low—wage firms but also the fact that a sample of last—hired
workers will overrepresent high turnover, low duration workers and jobs within
firms.

This must be kept in mind as results are interpreted below.
13Plant size actually refers to company employment levels within the

site,

for which exact magnitudes were gauged in the survey.

Total company

employment (i.e., both within snd outside the site) was then gauged using a
set of categories i.e., 1—100, 100—250,

250—500,

500—2000,

and 2000+.

We use

employment.

1Since we

focus here on wage levels rather than variances,

these

results are a bit different from those of Seiler and Weiss (see footnote 5)
who find higher variances when using individual level incentives,

It is,

however, quite plausible that the means and variances of worker compensation
are positively correlated.
15These magnitudes are roughly similar to those found by Bishop (1987)

with these data.

He focused on relative wage and productivity differences

between employees within firms, using a relatively small sample of workers
with vocational education (in addition to the 'last worker hired") about whom
questions were asked in the EOPP Survey.
is, of course,

possible that the correlations between wages and

productivity scores are explained by a tendency of supervisors to rate higher
wage employees with higher scores, thereby rationalizing the higher wages
which they receive anyway.

The experience—productivityeffects might also be

explained by a positive age—bias in scoring, as suggested by Rothe (1949).
17The case for negative selection into training is somewhat weakened by
the positive correlations between hours of training and levels of education

20

negative.

Both results are consistent with those observed by Mincer (1988)

and Lillard and Tan (1986).

When experience and training variables are

omitted from productivity score equations, the coefficient (and standard
error) on collective bargaining are .053 (.028) and .032 (.019) for initial

would thus raise wages by about 33% (Table 2) and productivity by about 10%
initially and 4% currently.
