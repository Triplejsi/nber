Firm-Level Risk Exposures and Stock Returns in the Wake of COVID-19

ABSTRACT
Firm-level stock returns differ enormously in reaction to COVID-19 news. We characterize these
reactions using the Risk Factors discussions in pre-pandemic 10-K filings and two text-analytic
approaches: expert-curated dictionaries and supervised machine learning (ML). Bad COVID-19
news lowers returns for firms with high exposures to travel, traditional retail, aircraft production
and energy supply -- directly and via downstream demand linkages -- and raises them for firms
with high exposures to healthcare policy, e-commerce, web services, drug trials and materials that
feed into supply chains for semiconductors, cloud computing and telecommunications. Monetary
and fiscal policy responses to the pandemic strongly impact firm-level returns as well, but
differently than pandemic news. Despite methodological differences, dictionary and ML
approaches yield remarkably congruent return predictions. Importantly though, ML operates on a
vastly larger feature space, yielding richer characterizations of risk exposures and outperforming
the dictionary approach in goodness-of-fit. By integrating elements of both approaches, we
uncover new risk factors and sharpen our explanations for firm-level returns. To illustrate the
broader utility of our methods, we also apply them to explain firm-level returns in reaction to the
March 2020 Super Tuesday election results.

Introduction

The economic disruption wrought by COVID-19 is unprecedented in modern times.
Real GDP fell 11 percent in the United States and 15 percent in the Euro area in
the first half of 2020, easily the largest drops since World War II. The International
Monetary Fund forecasts the sharpest global output contraction on record in 2020.1
Because its effects differ so greatly across sectors and firms, the COVID-19 shock is
also likely to drive large-scale reallocation activity. Recent survey evidence (Barrero
et al., 2020) and historical evidence (Davis and Haltiwanger, 1992) suggest that most
of the reallocation response will involve shifts across firms within industries.
Indeed, firm-level stock returns differ enormously in reaction to COVID-19 news
and policy responses. To highlight this point, Figure 1 plots daily market-level returns
against the same-day interquartile range of firm-level returns on all trading days in
2019 – and on 20 “jump” days from 24 February to 27 March 2020 when the market
rose or fell by at least 2.5%. Jump days show an extraordinary dispersion in firm-level
returns. On 18 March, for instance, the 75th percentile stock had a one-day return
advantage of 6.9 percentage points over the 25th percentile, more than 15 standard
deviations greater (in 2019 units) than the average cross-firm IQR in 2019. Recent
earnings announcements also underscore the asymmetric impact of COVID-19, with
Amazon and Facebook reporting Q2 2020 revenue growth of 40% and 11%, respectively,
both large upside surprises amidst a bleak earnings outlook for many firms.
We use the discussions of Risk Factors in pre-pandemic 10-K filings to characterize
firm-level risk exposures, explain firm-level equity returns on jump days, and interpret
the drivers of those returns. The basic idea is simple: When the language firms use
to describe their risks explains their stock price reactions to news about the pandemic
(or other news), it reveals information about the channels through which the market
expects the pandemic to affect their future earnings. We implement this idea in multiple
ways. We focus on jump days, because the news event that drove market reactions on

Figure 1: Value-Weighted Mean and Cross-Sectional IQR of U.S. Equity Returns,
Daily for 2019 and for Large Daily Jumps in 2020
We consider the value-weighted distribution of daily returns over 2,155 common stocks for all
trading days in 2019 and all 20 jump days in 2020 through 27 March. The mean (s.d.) of the
daily average return in 2019 is 0.12 (0.80) percent, and the mean (s.d.) of the daily IQR is 1.29
(0.36). The regression has 271 observations and an R-squared of 0.66, with standard errors in
parentheses. A test of the null hypothesis that the two rays have equal slopes with opposite signs
yields a p-value of 0.99. Jump classifications follow Baker et al. (2020a), who rely on human
readings of next-day newspaper accounts.

those dates is usually apparent. In this regard, we rely on the classifications in Baker
et al. (2020a), who consult next-day articles about the stock market jump in the New
York Times and the Wall Street Journal. For the vast majority of COVID-era jump
days, the two newspapers advance a common explanation for the jump.
Our results show that the text in 10-K filings contains highly granular, quantifiable
information about the forces that drive firm-level returns. For example, bad news about
COVID-19 lowers returns for firms with high exposures to travel, aircraft production,
traditional retail and energy supply – directly and via downstream demand linkages –

2

and raises them for firms with high exposures to healthcare policy, e-commerce, web
services, drug trials and materials that feed into supply chains for semiconductors,
cloud computing and telecommunications. We also find that the structure of firm-level
return reactions differs systematically with the type of news that drove the market,
as captured by the jump classifications. For example, on jump days attributed to
monetary policy easing, firm-level returns depend on exposures to inflation, interest
rates, and real estate rather than exposures that matter in reaction to pandemic news.
As the use of text-as-data expands in economics and finance (Gentzkow et al.,
2019a), it becomes ever more important to explore the strengths and weaknesses of
different text-analytic methods. Under the widely-used dictionary approach (Tetlock,
2007; Loughran and Mcdonald, 2011; Baker et al., 2016), the researcher relies on expertcurated term sets to characterize and quantify the information content in relevant text
documents. After extracting content measures, the researcher uses them to explain
outcomes of interest. In our implementation of the dictionary approach, we use the
term sets that Baker et al. (2019) apply to interpret aggregate stock market volatility.
A newer approach, growing in popularity, is supervised machine learning (ML).
Under this approach, an algorithm selects the terms in a very large feature space
that are useful in explaining an outcome of interest. To implement the ML approach,
we adopt the multinomial inverse regression (MNIR) method introduced by Taddy
(2013) and recently applied in economics by Gentzkow et al. (2019b). We adopt MNIR
because of its relative simplicity, its similarity to discrete-choice statistical models, and
its successful application in other economic settings.
MNIR differs in two major respects from the dictionary approach. First, it considers
all terms that appear in the discussions of Risk Factors as candidates for explaining
returns. The set of all terms is an order of magnitude larger than the term sets
encompassed by the curated dictionaries. Second, MNIR weights each term based
on the strength of its association with the outcome of interest (firm-level returns, in
our case). In contrast, dictionary approaches typically weight terms based on their
frequency in the text documents of interest and perhaps in external sources as well.
3

Despite their differences, we find a remarkable congruence in predicted firm-level
returns between the dictionary and ML approaches. Return predictions from one
approach vary one-for-one, on average, with predictions from the other approach. In
addition, the adjusted R2 values in cross-sectional return regressions vary closely across
jump days under the two approaches. At the same time, MNIR achieves a uniformly
higher adjusted R2 . For example, our MNIR model explains one-half of firm-level
abnormal return variation on pandemic fallout days, as compared to one-third under
the dictionary approach. The superior fit arises entirely because MNIR draws on a
much larger feature space, as we show, rather than on other differences between the two
approaches. By tapping a much larger feature space, MNIR captures many systematic
aspects of the firm-level return structure that the dictionary approach misses.
However, it is hard to obtain clear insights from raw MNIR results. To address this
challenge, we proceed in steps. First, we identify seed terms that MNIR weights highly
in explaining firm-level returns. In a second step, we use the seeds to automatically
generate a set of related terms based on similarity of linguistic context and MNIR
weights. Third, we prune the automatically generated lists to obtain term sets that
define our new risk exposure categories. This process for developing exposure categories
and associated term sets draws on both our high-dimensional MNIR model and our
domain expertise. In this sense, it incorporates elements of both ML and expertcurated dictionary approaches. Armed with our new term sets, we quantify firm-level
exposures to each category. Finally, we incorporate the firm-level exposure measures
in straightforward regression models that yield easily interpretable results.
When we apply this hybrid approach, we obtain a much richer characterization
of the forces that drive firm-level returns. It is how we uncover the role of exposures to social distancing restrictions, drug trials, e-commerce and more. It is also
how we uncover the role of downstream demand linkages. For example, downstream
exposure to aircraft production predicts negative firm-level returns in reaction to bad
COVID-19 news. The same news predicts positive returns for firms with high exposures
to specific metals (e.g., tantalum and tungsten) that are critical for semiconductors,
4

lasers, integrated circuits and for cloud computing and telecommunications. Acemoglu
et al. (2016) show how downstream demand shocks operate in theory by propagating
upstream through the production network.2 Our results highlight the role of the production network for understanding the effects of the COVID-19 shock. While evidence
of COVID-19’s impact on final consumer spending is now plentiful (Andersen et al.,
2020; Baker et al., 2020b; Carvalho et al., 2020; Chetty et al., 2020; Cox et al., 2020;
Surico et al., 2020), we show that its impact on input demands is also important.
Dictionary methods and supervised ML are sometimes seen to occupy opposite ends
of a methodological spectrum. Our study shows they are complements as much as substitutes. In this regard, our hybrid approach to uncovering risk factors and constructing
associated term sets is useful more broadly. As a further illustration, we use the hybrid
approach to characterize returns the day after the 2020 Super Tuesday elections. The
market rose 4% in reaction to these elections, widely regarded as a decisive victory for
Joe Biden that greatly raised his chances of securing the Democratic nomination. We
again apply our hybrid approach to uncover risk factors, build associated term sets,
and use them to explain firm-level returns. We find that Super Tuesday drove negative returns for firms with high exposure to hotels, gambling, fracking, and financial
management; and positive returns for firms with high exposure to healthcare, health
insurance, REITs, property rentals, communications and construction. Our hybrid
approach lends itself to many other applications as well, including text-based analyses
of what drives other outcomes.
An active literature considers how firm-level equity returns have responded to
COVID-19. Here, we take note of a few studies that are particularly relevant to ours.
Hassan et al. (2020) use natural language processing methods and human readings to
quantify what firms say about COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in their earnings
calls. They aggregate over their firm-level measures to show how sentiments related to
COVID-19 vary by country and time.3 They also show that equity returns are lower
2

Other relevant theoretical analyses include Long and Plosser (1983), Atalay (2017), and Baqaee
and Farhi (2019). See Carvalho and Tahbaz-Salehi (2019) for a review.

Stephany et al. (2020) use the text in 10-K filings to track the evolution of COVID-related concerns

5

in 2020 for firms that express greater concern about COVID-19 in their earnings calls.
Our approach yields much more granular measures of business risk exposures, which we
use to explain firm-level return reactions to distinct types of news events. Our reliance
on 10-K filings before the pandemic struck yields an ex ante characterization of risk exposures rather than an ex post one. Our approach also yields a fuller characterization
of risk exposures, because firms face legal and financial liabilities for failing to disclose
material risks in their regulatory filings (Mast et al., 2020). In contrast, earnings calls
tend to focus on a limited set of salient concerns.
Papanikolaou and Schmidt (2020) and Pagano et al. (2020) use industry differences
in employee ability to work from home (WFH) to explain firm-level returns (and other
outcomes) in the wake of COVID-19. Their evidence fits well with our finding that bad
COVID-19 news triggers positive return reactions at firms with high exposure to web
services, the demand for which rises with reliance on remote interactivity. However, our
evidence about firm-level returns is largely distinct from the evidence in their study and
others that use industry-level variation to characterize risk exposures. When we control
for industry fixed effects, our text-based measures continue to have ample explanatory
power for firm-level returns, underscoring how risk exposures and return reactions vary
greatly even among firms in the same industry.
Laeven (2020) finds that social distancing measures adopted in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic affect firms partly through input-output linkages. Ramelli and
Wagner (2020) stress the role of upstream supply shocks due to disrupted exports from
China, especially in the early stages of the pandemic. We focus on the period during
which COVID-19 emerged as a global, rather than Chinese, health crisis and find an
important role for many aspects of supply-chain linkages in driving firm-level abnormal
return reactions to news about COVID-19.
A broader finance literature uses the Risk Factors to study equity returns, but
few papers incorporate machine learning methods. Hanley and Hoberg (2019) and
Lopez Lira (2019) use unsupervised learning approaches to group 10-K words into
at aggregate and industry levels.

6

clusters that correlate with stock returns. Ke et al. (2019) propose a supervised learning framework for predicting stock returns using media text data, which they show
outperforms standard sentiment dictionaries at return prediction. Our study is more
focused on organizing terms into interpretable categories that inform our understanding
of what drives firm-level return reactions to common shocks.
Our study proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses our data sources, the dictionary
approach, and MNIR. Section 3 presents results based on the dictionary approach.
Section 4 implements the MNIR approach, establishes a close relationship between the
return predictions generated by the two approaches, and shows that MNIR delivers
better fitting models. We also show that a standard clustering algorithm applied to
MNIR return predictions sorts jump days into categories that align closely with the
classification that Baker et al. (2020a) derive from next-day newspaper accounts of large
market-level moves. It is both remarkable and reassuring that two entirely different
methods, drawing on such dissimilar text sources, yield similar classifications of jump
days. Section 5 develops and implements our hybrid approach, first applying it to
pandemic-related jump days and then to Super Tuesday. Section 6 concludes.

2.1

Data and Empirical Methods
Firm-level returns and other financial measures

We consider daily returns for 2,155 equity securities on the 20 jump days from 24
February to 27 March that Baker et al. (2020a) identify and classify. To compute
returns, we obtain daily closing prices (PRCCD) of common equities traded on AMEX,
NYSE and NASDAQ from the Compustat North America Security Daily file. We
account for stock splits, dividends, etc. using the daily adjustment factor (AJEXDI)
and the daily total return factor (TRFD) in the same Compustat file. We restrict
attention to U.S.-incorporated firms with share prices quoted in U.S. Dollars. See
Appendix A for more information about our sample.

7

Figure B.1 displays an analog to Figure 1 that considers the cross-firm standard
deviation of daily returns in place of the IQR. Figures B.2 to B.4 display histograms of
daily market-level returns, the IQR of firm-level returns, and the standard deviation of
firm-level returns for trading days in 2019 alongside analogous statistics for the jump
days in 2020. These figures reinforce the chief message of Figure 1: The jump days
in our sample are extreme events with respect to both market-level returns and the
dispersion of firm-level returns.
Our main outcomes of interest are firm-level abnormal returns constructed in the
standard way. Specifically, we generate daily security-level abnormal returns for jump
days as the difference between (i) a stock’s actual return in excess of the risk free rate
and (ii) its expected excess return per the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):


Abni,t

pi,t
= log
pi,t−1


− Rf,t − betai × RM,t − Rf,t



(1)

where pi,t denotes the adjusted share price for stock i on day t, Rf denotes the fourweek treasury bill rate (a proxy for the risk free rate), betai is the stock’s CAPM beta,
and RM is the value-weighted average market return. We estimate each stock’s beta
using an OLS regression of its daily excess return on the contemporaneous market-level
excess return in the sample of all trading days in 2019.
Our statistical models for (abnormal) returns include two controls for financial
characteristics. The first is a measure of the firm’s equity market capitalization, Mcapit ,
computed as shares outstanding (CSHOC) times closing price per share.4 The second
is firm leverage, computed as (long term debt (DLTT) + current liabilities (DLC))
divided by total assets (AT). We use the most recent data in the Compustat file for
this purpose, yielding leverage values based on fiscal year 2019 (2018) for 89 (11)
percent of firms. Appendix Table B.1 reports descriptive statistics for these and other
variables used in our firm-level analyses.
4

In a slight abuse of notation, we often refer to i as a firm whereas it actually indexes stocks. In
the few cases where a firm has multiple stocks, we assign the same Mcapit value to each one.

2.2

The Risk Factors text in 10-K files

Since 2006 (for fiscal year 2005), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has
required the vast majority of publicly held firms to include a discussion of Risk Factors
(RF ) in Part 1a of their annual 10-K filings. The SEC advises that these discussions
include any item that could impact future earnings. Investors can sue for compensation
if the firm omits material information or risks (Mast et al., 2020). We use RF texts
filed from 2010 to July 2016. (Machine-readable versions are available from EDGAR.)
This choice of years mitigates the role of idiosyncratic language in a single filing and
ensures that any relationship we find between the RF text and returns in 2020 reflects
persistent risk exposures that long predate the arrival of COVID-19.
Appendix A describes how we pre-process the raw text files to obtain documents
composed of words and phrases. After pre-processing, there are 18,911 unique terms
that appear a total of 57 million times in our RF corpus. The large number of terms
necessitates some form of dimension reduction, which we accomplish in two distinct
ways: first, curated dictionaries that identify terms of interest and organize them into
categories; second, Taddy’s (2013, 2015) MNIR model, which operates on all terms.

2.3

Empirical approach 1: Curated dictionaries

We adopt the dictionaries of Baker et al. (2019), who expand on ones previously developed by Baker et al. (2016) and Davis (2017). One attraction of these dictionaries is
their detail. They include 16 dictionaries that cover aspects of economic and financial
conditions and another 20 that pertain to policy areas. Each one contains numerous
terms that effectively define the dictionary’s category. The construction of these dictionaries reflects the input and judgment of expert economists drawing on textbooks,
newspaper articles, 10-K filings, and “their own knowledge of economic matters and
input from other economists in seminars and personal communications.” Baker et al.
(2019) show that these dictionaries are useful for tracking and interpreting movements
in stock market volatility, which is conceptually related to stock market jumps.
9

The dictionaries contain 430 terms that appear in our RF corpus, 244 after removing rare terms at the pre-processing stage.5 These 244 terms appear nearly 1.4 million
times, constituting 2.4% of the RF corpus. The RF texts for a given firm contain 28
distinct dictionary terms on average (standard deviation of 10) and 642 instances of
dictionary terms (standard deviation of 620). To quantify a firm’s exposure to a given
risk category, we identify sentences in its RF texts that contain at least one term in the
corresponding dictionary.6 After computing the fraction of such sentences in each of
the firm’s RF texts, we calculate the average fraction. In this way, we obtain 36 firmlevel exposure values, one for each category and its associated dictionary. Descriptive
statistics for these firm-level exposure measures appear in table B.1.

2.4

Empirical approach 2: Multinomial inverse regression

MNIR treats the RF texts for each firm i as a bag-of-words represented by a V dimensional vector xi of terms or “features.” xi,v is the count of term v for firm i, and
V = 18, 911 is the number of unique terms in our RF corpus. At the firm level, the
average number of nonzero elements in xi is 2,245, with a standard deviation of 891.
Many popular machine learning approaches to text analysis in economics and finance (e.g., latent Dirichlet allocation) represent documents in a latent space of “topics.” These approaches reduce the dimensionality of text but can yield topics that lack
clear relationships to the outcomes of interest. MNIR models the relationship between
the terms in xi and the outcomes of interest directly. The resulting statistical structure
is similar to ones that arise in standard econometric models of discrete choice. Taddy’s
(2013) original MNIR model was inspired by an economics application (Gentzkow and
Shapiro, 2010), and it has been further applied in Gentzkow et al. (2019b). These observations suggest that MNIR is a promising tool for the text-based analysis of firm-level
5

Three Baker et al. (2019) dictionaries – foreign trade exposure, immigration policy, and
government-sponsored enterprises – contain only rare terms. We drop these three categories in our
implementation of the dictionary approach. Retaining them has little impact on the results.
6
We handle plurals using the NLTK WordNet Lemmatizer. For example, “recession” and “recessions” are both captured by the “Broad Quantity Indicators” category reported in Appendix A.3.

10

returns and for exploring how machine learning methods can extend and complement
the use of dictionary methods in economics and finance.
MNIR posits xi ∼ MN(qi , Ni ), where qi is a multinomial V -dimensional probability
P
vector and Ni is the total number of terms in firm i’s RF texts (i.e., Ni = v xi,v ).
The probability of feature v for firm i is
qi,v

exp(av + yiT bv )
P
=
,
T
v exp(av + yi bv )

(2)

where yi = (Abni , ci ) contains firm-i abnormal returns on a given day or collection of
days and firm controls ci ∈ RP . (We suppress time subscripts here.) av is a parameter
that controls for the baseline frequency of term v in the corpus, and bv is a P + 1
vector of coefficients that describe how firm observables map to the probability that
term v appears in the RF texts.
Equation (2) describes a multinomial logistic regression over V categories, which we
fit to 2,155 observations (per jump day), one per firm. The outcome being modeled is
the probability that a particular term in V appears in a random draw from the firm’s
RF texts. The fitted model delivers 18,911 estimated probabilities for 2,155 firms.
The non-standard aspect of (2) is the high dimensionality of V . So, we estimate (2)
using Bayesian regularization methods with a Gamma-Laplace prior structure on the
regression coefficients. (This estimation method is a more flexible form of the standard
LASSO penalty, one that admits coefficient-specific penalization.) The selection of
the prior trades off goodness-of-fit and model complexity via the maximization of an
information criterion to avoid over-fitting (see Taddy, 2013 and Taddy, 2015 for details).
We seek to use RF text features to predict returns, while (2) models the inverse
relationship of term probabilities given returns. To move from estimates of (2) to a
forward regression with Abni as the dependent variable, we follow Taddy (2013) and
P
define a sufficient reduction projection zi = v xi,v b1,v with the property Abni ⊥ xi |
zi , Ni , ci . Thus, conditional on the scalar projection zi , the high-dimensional raw data
contain no extra predictive information for returns. This result does not specify the

11

functional form for relating zi to Abni in a forward regression, but it says we can model
Abni as a function of zi , Ni , ci , while disregarding xi .

2.5

Why two empirical approaches?

We adopt two distinct approaches to the analysis of firm-level equity returns for two
reasons. First, we want to compare their strengths and weaknesses in a rich, concrete
setting. Second, we want to explore whether and how empirical researchers can enrich
their text-based analyses by combining elements of both approaches.
A clear advantage of the dictionary approach is it simplicity and transparency. Its
implementation does not require the estimation of a first-stage statistical model, as
in the inverse regression model (2). It relies instead on domain expertise, as codified
in the dictionaries, to organize and quantify the text data and to use the resulting
quantification to explain outcomes of interest.
A key advantage of MNIR (in common with all supervised learning models) is the
ability to use all terms in the text corpus to explain the outcomes of interest. In
our context, that means using the RF texts to explain systematic aspects of firmlevel return reactions to pandemic-related news and other common shocks. Our MNIR
model considers all 18,911 terms in our RF corpus, while the dictionary approach
considers only 244 terms organized into 36 categories. As a result of its much larger
feature space, MNIR can potentially capture aspects of the firm-level returns structure
that the dictionary approach misses.
Two claims often arise in comparisons between dictionary and ML methods. First,
that dictionary methods more readily yield results with clear interpretations. Second,
that ML methods require less need for domain expertise or its costly codification.
Each claim contains a kernel of truth, but the reality is more complex in our setting.
In particular, dictionary methods often but not always yield easy-to-interpret results.
We show how to use ML methods to sharpen the interpretations of dictionary-based
results. Conversely, we also show how to use dictionary methods and domain expertise

12

to interpret results that emerge from an MNIR implementation of the ML approach.

Results Based on the Dictionary Approach

To implement the dictionary approach, we fit regression models for daily firm-level
returns via least-squares estimation. Our models have the following form:

Abnit =

J
X

βj RExpji + βJ+1 Leveragei + βJ+2 log(Mcapit ) + γs(i) + it ,

(3)

j=1

where Abnit is firm-i’s abnormal return on day t, RExpji is its exposure to risk category
j = 1, 2, ..., 36, Leveragei and Mcapit are the financial controls defined earlier, and γs(i)
are NAICS2 fixed effects. Apart from fixed effects, all regressors enter (3) in standard
deviation units. We fit (3) separately for each jump day or collection of same-type
jump days according to the classification in Figure 1. When fitting to a collection of
days, we use average values of Abnit and log(Mcapit ) for the days in question. The
collection of fiscal policy jumps includes three days with a positive market return and
one, 23 March, with a negative return in reaction to a delay in passing a fiscal relief
bill. To account for this sign flip, we multiply firm-level abnormal returns on 23 March
by -1 before averaging over days.
Table 1 reports estimates of (3), suppressing coefficients that are insignificant at
the 10 percent level. Our simple model explains much of the (very large) abnormal
return variation on jump days: Adjusted R2 values range from 20% the day after
Super Tuesday to 33% on pandemic fallout days and 36% for the March 9 Oil Price
Crash. While not our focus, we observe that the financial controls are important return
predictors. Market cap is a highly significant return predictor on jump days and,
consistent with the evidence in Alfaro et al. (2020) and Ramelli and Wagner (2020),
more leveraged firms perform worse in reaction to bad news about the pandemic.
Many of our dictionary-based exposure measures are also significant return predictors. As seen in Column (1), firms with high exposures to inflation, credit indicators,

taxes, entitlement programs, energy and environmental regulations, and transportation,
infrastructure and utilities react especially negatively to bad news about the pandemic
and its economic fallout. Firms with high exposures to intellectual property and healthcare policy perform relatively well in reaction to bad pandemic news. As reported in
Table B.1, 21 firms (1% of our sample) have intellectual property exposures more than
3.5 standard deviations greater than the mean exposure, which implies a one-day positive abnormal return differential on pandemic fallout days of at least (0.45)(3.5)=
1.6 percentage points for these firms.7 The intellectual property category is especially
relevant for pharmaceutical firms, as its dictionary includes “patent” and “new drug
application.” Thus, the large, positive coefficient on intellectual property fits well with
the view that bad news about the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is relatively
good for firms that own or develop healthcare-related intellectual property.
Looking across the columns in Table 1, the structure of firm-level return reactions
differs systematically by jump type. For example, jumps attributed to monetary policy
easing yield large positive return reactions for firms with high exposures to inflation
and interest rates but not to intellectual property or transportation, infrastructure and
utilities. Jump days attributed to fiscal policy news generate the largest return reaction at firms with high exposure to the tax category. Firms exposed to tax-sensitive
categories like real estate and business investment also outperform on fiscal policy jump
days. However, the precise interpretation of some of these patterns is unclear. The tax
category, for example, captures exposures to both high taxes and the potential for large
tax credits (e.g., for R&D or investment). This example illustrates the interpretation
challenges that can arise under the dictionary approach.
Several exposure measures play a role in driving firm-level return reactions to the
Super Tuesday elections, including real estate, commodity markets, intellectual property, and financial regulation. These reactions reflect revised assessments of Job Biden’s

Examples include Universal Display Corporation with an intellectual property exposure 5.7 standard deviations greater than the mean exposure, Editas Medicine, Inc. (5.6), Interdigital, Inc. (5.4),
Dicerna Pharmaceuticals (5.1), Gilead Sciences (4.9), Kindred Biosciences (4.7), Biolife (4.5), Qualcomm (4.4) and Blueprint Medicines (4.0).

(and Bernie Sanders’) prospects of becoming the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, how the general election campaign would play out in view of the expected nominee,
and the likelihood that Donald Trump would win re-election. The revision in assessments affect relative returns positively at firms exposed to real estate, for example, and
negatively at firms exposed to commodity markets, e.g., oil and gas companies.
The Oil Price Crash came with a huge 7.9 percentage point drop in the overall stock
market on 9 March. As reported in Column (5), firms with high exposure to commodity
markets and energy and environmental regulations experienced especially large stock
price drops. Consider a firm at the 99th exposure percentile for commodity markets.
According to Table B.1, this firm’s commodity markets exposure is 4.6 standard deviation units greater than the average firm’s exposure. Thus, conditional on the other
covariates in (3), the estimated model predicts that the 99th percentile firm has oneday negative abnormal return differential of (−1.73)(4.6) = −8.0 percentage points.
This calculation illustrates a broader point: Some firms have extremely high exposures
to one or a small number of risk categories. As a result, big shocks that pertain to
particular exposure categories can drive very large firm-level return differentials.8
To summarize, our implementation of the dictionary approach yields an initial
characterization of firm-level reactions to various market-moving news events in the
wake of COVID-19. Some ambiguities arise when seeking to interpret the results,
perhaps because the dictionaries were not specifically designed to characterize stock
market behavior on our particualr jump days. Moreover, as we have stressed, the
dictionary approach taps only a small fraction of the RF corpus.
8

Given this, one might worry about our exclusion of dictionary terms that appear rarely in the RF
corpus. While rare overall, these terms might capture important exposures at a few firms. To assess
this concern, we ran jump-day regressions using exposure measures based on the full set of 430 terms
in Baker et al. (2019) and compared them to the ones based on our more limited set of 244 terms.
Figure B.5 plots the adjusted R2 for each pair of regressions across days and shows they are nearly
identical. Thus, nothing is lost in our application by dropping the rare dictionary terms.

Exploiting the Full RF Corpus

4.1

How much gain in fit from MNIR?

We estimate the inverse regression (2) separately for each jump day or collection of
days with controls cit = (Leveragei , log(Mcapit ), γs(i) ). Our forward regression is
Abnit = α1 zit + α2 Ni + α3 Leveragei + α4 Log(M capit ) + γs(i) + εit ,

(4)

which we estimate by ordinary least squares. Ni is the number of terms in firm i’s RF
texts, and zit is the sufficient reduction projection that summarizes the information in
the inverse regression. We first examine the gain in fit achieved by MNIR relative to
the dictionary approach. To do so, we separately estimate (3) and (4) for each of the
17 jump days covered by Table 1.
There are two reasons why MNIR might have greater explanatory power. First, (2)
allows more flexibility in the relationship between returns and terms. Because (2) is fit
with regularization, terms are selected or not based on the strength of their association
with returns. Moreover, selected terms can have different regression coefficients. In
contrast, the dictionary approach constrains all terms in the same category to have the
same relationship to returns. There is, for instance, no down weighting of terms in a
given dictionary that are less helpful in quantifying return-relevant exposures. Second,
MNIR operates on a vastly larger feature space. Insofar as there is useful information
about returns in the 18,667 terms (= 18, 911 − 244) not classified in the dictionaries,
we expect MNIR to achieve a better fit. To distinguish between these two possible
reasons for a better fit, we also estimate MNIR using just the 244 dictionary terms. To
summarize, we fit three sets of regressions and obtain three sets of adjusted R2 values
corresponding to (i) the dictionary approach, (ii) MNIR based on the 244 dictionary
terms, and (iii) MNIR based on all 18,911 terms.
Figure 2 displays the results. Figure 2a shows that the two approaches achieve
essentially the same fit when using the same terms, and that this result holds across
17

jump days. That is, the greater flexibility of MNIR in how it relates returns to terms
does not materially improve goodness of fit. Whatever interpretation value the dictionary approach offers by organizing terms into categories does not come at the expense
of model fit – at least not in our application with our dictionaries.

Figure 2: R2 achieved via Dictionary and Machine Learning Approaches
This figure plots the adjusted R2 from regressions (3) and (4). The left panel displays
results when using only the 244 dictionary terms as inputs into the MNIR model, while
the right panel displays results when using all terms. Each plot presents a fitted regression
line that relates the R2 values (solid black line), along with 95% confidence intervals
corresponding to the shaded region. The dashed line is the 45-degree line.

Figure 2b compares the dictionary approach to the MNIR implementation that
uses all terms in the RF corpus. Here, we see a uniformly better fit for MNIR. The
fit gain is large: The adjusted R2 value is roughly 20 percentage points higher under
MNIR on all jump days. The implication is that, at least in our setting, the supervised
machine learning approach more fully explains returns entirely because it considers a
much larger set of terms than the dictionary approach.
Figure 2b carries a subtler message than supervised learning fits better. In particular, there is a close, approximately one-for-one relationship across jump days between
18

the R2 values for the two approaches. The confidence interval for the slope coefficient
relating the R2 values contains 1. This result suggests that MNIR and the dictionaries
draw on similar information to explain returns, since their ability to do so is highly
correlated across jump days. Next, we develop this point more fully.

4.2

Comparing predicted firm-level returns

Figure 3 plots fitted values for abnormal returns using the dictionary approach against
the corresponding MNIR predictions (using all terms). To construct this figure, we fit
abnormal return models separately for the 17 jump days to obtain 36,635 predictions
under each approach. Remarkably, the regression line that relates the two sets of
predicted outcomes is indistinguishable from the 45 degree line. In other words, the
predicted firm-level return from the dictionary approach is an unbiased estimate of the
MNIR prediction. This result also holds on each individual jump day.
One might worry that this one-for-one relationship is an artifact of including industry fixed effects under both approaches. To check this, we drop industry effects and
refit models that focus on the text-based measures. Figure B.7 displays the results.
In the pooled sample, we continue to find a near one-for-one relationship in fitted abnormal returns between the two approaches. There is also a close, near one-for-one
relationship on most – but not all – individual jump days. For example, the regression
slope is only 0.822 on 24 March. Thus, the striking result in Figure 3 is not an artifact
of industry effects or the consequence of some other mechanical effect.
While predictions under the two approaches coincide on average, predicted return
distributions differ in the higher moments. Figure 4 summarizes the predicted abnormal return distributions under several specifications. The dispersion of predicted
returns is similar when including sector fixed effects alone or dictionary measures alone
(including financial controls in both cases), as shown by comparing the second and
third box plots in Figure 4. Using both industry effects and dictionary measures yields
somewhat greater dispersion in predicted returns. Using MNIR yields a considerably

more dispersed distribution of predicted returns, confirming that it captures additional
return-relevant information in the RF corpus.

4.3

Text-based measures and narrow industry classifications

We now ask whether our text sources and methods capture information about returns
beyond what is captured by narrow industry definitions. An affirmative answer provides
evidence about firm heterogeneity and offers a means to characterize it. The question
is also important in the context of the COVID-19 literature. Both Pagano et al.
(2020) and Papanikolaou and Schmidt (2020) construct industry-level exposures (up
to NAICS4 granularity) to restrictions on labor supply due to the inability of employees
to work from home. They argue that differences in this source of exposure drive much
of the firm-level variation in stock returns during 2020. By controlling for narrowly

defined industries, we can assess whether text-based measures pick up information

beyond the supply-side shocks that these studies highlight.

There are 216 unique NAICS4 industries in our baseline sample, from which we drop
the 287 firms that lie in industry codes with fewer than five firms overall or with no
available NAICS4 code. This leaves a subsample containing 1,868 firms distributed over
97 unique NAICS4 codes. For each jump day, we model abnormal returns as depending
on firm financial controls and NAICS4 fixed effects, and we record the adjusted R2 . We
then add the dictionary exposures and the sufficient reduction projection, respectively,
and we again record the adjusted R2 . Figure 5 plots the results.

(b) Machine Learning Method

Figure 5: Improvement in R2 beyond Narrow Industry Codes
This figure plots adjusted R2 values from regression models fit to firm-level returns
on jump days. The horizontal scale shows the adjusted R2 in models with NAICS4
fixed effects and firm-level financial controls. The vertical scale shows the adjusted
R2 values that result when adding dictionary-based measures (panel (a)) or the
sufficient reduction projection estimated in (2) (panel (b)). Models are fit to the
subsample of firms that lie in NAICS4 industries with five or more firms.

Figure 5a shows that adding dictionary measures does not shrink the residual variance in the return regressions, conditional on narrowly defined industry controls. That
does not mean dictionary measures are uninformative about return drivers, but they
don’t improve model fit relative to detailed industry controls. In contrast, Figure 5b

22

shows that including the sufficient reduction projection yields a large R2 gain on every
jump day.9 In Section 5, we develop an approach to uncovering and interpreting the
additional information about return drivers captured by MNIR.

4.4

Clustering jump days based on return structures

Recall that Baker et al. (2020a) use human readings of next-day newspaper accounts
to classify market-level jumps as to reason (pandemic fallout, fiscal policy, etc.). We
now apply an automated approach to classify jump days based on the structure of
predicted firm-level abnormal returns. For this exercise, we measure returns in (2),
(3), and (4) as Abnit × (5.5/AvgERt ), where 5.5 is the average market-level move
in our sample of 17 jump days. This rescaling of returns ensures that our clustering
reflects the structure of abnormal returns and not their overall magnitude or direction.
We then fit our regression models separately by day and build a 17 × 17 matrix, where
the (t1 , t2 ) element is the correlation between the day-t1 fitted values and the day-t2
fitted values. Given this matrix, we apply a standard hierarchical clustering algorithm
to group like days together, and display the results as dendograms in Figure 6.10
The dendograms reveal two interesting results. First, we obtain similar clusterings of jump days under the dictionary and ML approaches. This result reinforces
our earlier conclusion that these two very different methodologies yield congruent return predictions. Second, the clustering that emerges from our automated analysis
of firm-level return structures based on Risk Factors texts in 10-K files is similar to
the newspaper-based classification of market-level jumps in Baker et al. (2020a). The
9

This result holds even though we estimate the inverse regression model (2) on a sample of 2,155
firms, which involves a potentially different relationship between terms and returns than the smaller
sample of firms considered in Figure 5.
10
The clustering algorithm works as follows. Start with a separate cluster for each jump day. In step
1, group the two days with the highest correlation of fitted values, yielding 16 clusters. Again compute
the correlation between each cluster, using the minimum correlation value between all cross-cluster
observations as the similarity metric when the cluster covers more than one day. This is known as
‘complete link clustering’. Repeat this process until all observations lie in a single cluster. The height
of the dendogram corresponds to the similarity level at which clusters are merged. See, for example,
chapter 17 of Manning et al. (2009) for more details.

23

similarity is particularly evident for the MNIR approach. With few exceptions, the
clustering algorithm groups the “fiscal” and “monetary policy” jumps (according to
newspaper-based approach) into distinct blocks, as it does for the “pandemic fallout”
jumps. Interestingly, the clustering algorithm groups Super Tuesday with other policy
jumps, and it groups the oil price crash with other pandemic fallout days. These results
support the idea that the Super Tuesday elections shifted expectations about future
polices, while the oil price collapse shifted other aspects of the economic outlook. We
conclude that identifiable categories of news events differ in how they interact with
firm-level risk exposures to drive the structure of firm-level return reactions.

(a) Dictionary Method

(b) Machine Learning Method

Figure 6: Clustering of Days via Different Methods
This figure displays dendograms that represent clusterings of our 17 event days. In
the left-hand panel, we cluster days based on the correlation matrix of the fitted
values from (3) fit with Abnit × (5.5/AvgERt ) as the dependent variable; in the
right-hand panel, we cluster days based instead on the fitted values from (4) fit with
the same dependent variable. In both cases, we use a complete-link hierarchical
clustering algorithm, and color-code days in line with manually-assigned labels.

Uncovering and Interpreting Risk Factors

We now use our MNIR model to uncover and interpret the risk exposures that drive
return reactions, a different undertaking than the usual prediction-oriented application
of machine learning. The major challenge here is to organize the thousands of estimated
model parameters in an insightful way. A first step in this direction is to exploit the
grouping of jump days in Figure 1 and Section 3. From there, we use MNIR models to
develop new exposure measures that yield insights into how shocks affect the structure
of firm-level returns. Our first application is to pandemic fallout days.

5.1

Risk exposures for pandemic fallout days

When fit to pandemic fallout days, our MNIR model places positive weight on 9,948
terms and negative weight on 8,389 terms (574 terms are not selected into the model).
Table B.2 displays terms with the largest positive and negative inverse regression coefficients on abnormal returns, given by b1,v , the first element of bv in (2). These terms
suggest a more granular characterization of exposures than the baseline dictionaries.
For example, while both “wheat” and “oil” appear in the dictionary for Commodity Markets, “wheat” is the term most associated with positive returns and “oil” is
among those associated with negative returns. A natural interpretation is that pandemic news shifted their demands in opposite directions. Wheat is an input into basic
food production, which remained stable as the pandemic unfolded – while oil supports
the physical movement of goods and people, which fell dramatically. Other important
terms include “games,” “optics,” “patents” and “clinical trials” as predictors of positive returns and “restaurants,” “hotels,” “airline industry” and “jet fuel” as predictors
of negative returns.
Certain companies also feature prominently: “Intel” has a high association with
positive returns, and “Delta,” “Phillips” and “Boeing” have high associations with
negative returns. Since we drop terms that appear in the RF texts of fewer than 25
firms, these findings say that the return reactions of many firms are strongly affected
25

by their commercial connections to these companies.
We can inspect return drivers for individual firms as well. Table 2 lists the ten firms
with the greatest residual shrinkage when adding the sufficient reduction projection to
the regression model.11 The table provides a short business description for each firm
and lists its top five terms – calculated as b̂1,v times the firm’s tf-idf score for the
), where xi,v is the count of term v in firm i’s RF texts
corresponding term, xi,v log( 2133
dfv
and dfv is the number of firms that use term v in their RF texts.12 For example, top
terms in predicting a positive return reaction to bad pandemic news for Netflix reflect
its digital video services. The top terms for predicting a positive reaction for Novavax,
which develops vaccines, include “vaccine” and “clinical trials.” Marcus Corporation
offers an example of a firm with exposures that create reinforcing negative return
reactions, as it operates both hotels and cinemas.

5.2

Uncovering risk exposures: A systematic approach

To construct risk exposures, we start with “seeds” drawn from (a) terms with large
MNIR coefficients, |b̂1,v |; and (b) terms with large tf-idf weighted MNIR coefficients,
|b̂1,v |xv log( 2133
), where xv is the count of term v in the RF corpus. We work with 45
dfv
seeds that reflect both positive and negative return reactions and that appear to cover
the main exposures surfaced by our MNIR model fit to pandemic-related jump days.
Table 3 reports the seeds and corresponding category names.
Next, we use the seeds to build sets comprised of related terms. Here, a typical
NLP approach groups words based on semantic relatedness. We rely partly on that
approach and, to this end, deploy the popular word2vec model of word embeddings
(Mikolov et al., 2013). This method inputs every sentence in our RF corpus and returns
11

Figure B.8 shows that predicted returns for these firms align more closely with actual returns
as we go from a no-text model to one that includes dictionary-based measures to MNIR. Echoing
results in Section 4, the two text-based approaches yield concordant results, but MNIR captures more
information and yields better predictions.
12
The log( 2133
dfv ) expression down weights generic terms that are less useful in distinguishing among
firms. 2133 is the number of unique firms in the data for which we have 10-K filings, so a term that
appears in every firm’s filings would get a weight of zero.

a vector representation of each of the 18,911 terms. We use these vectors to group terms
that are similar with respect to surrounding language in the corpus. This approach
groups nearly identical terms like “pipeline” and “pipelines” and semantically similar
terms like “cheese” and “foods.” However, it neglects the fact that semantically related
words can differ in the sign of their relationship to returns, as with “oil” and “wheat.”
Thus, we must account for both semantic similarity and relationship to returns. And,
as in Table 2, we want to down weight generic terms that are less helpful in capturing
exposures that differ among firms.
In view of these multiple considerations, we build new term sets by associating each
seed with terms in the RF corpus that meet two criteria:
1. High specificity and same sign: Among terms v with an MNIR coefficient of the
same sign as the one for the seed, we select those with |b̂1,v |xv log( 2133
) > 200.
dfv
2. High contextual similarity, as measured by cosine similarity of the embedding
vectors: In practice, we require a term’s embedding vector to have a cosine
similarity greater than 0.4 with that of the seed.
Higher thresholds yield more suitable terms at the cost of excluding potentially relevant
terms. Lower thresholds capture additional terms but at the cost of less suitability. We
adjust the thresholds to strike a reasonable balance between these concerns. Applying
criterion 1 yields 8,513 seed-generated terms. Further applying criterion 2 leaves us
with 1,100 terms in addition to the 45 seeds. When a term meets both criteria for
multiple seeds, we assign it to the seed for which its cosine similarity is highest.
Appendix C.1 lists all terms grouped with each seed under this approach. By and
large, the term sets reflect coherent exposure categories, even when the seed is highly
specific. For example, tantalum (a rare earth metal) is a key input into the manufacture
of electronic circuits and equipment. The set seeded by “tantalum” contains other key
inputs in the manufacturing supply chain for electronic components and “democratic
republic of congo,” a major source country for rare earth mineral mining.

Table 3: MNIR-Generated Exposure Categories for Pandemic Fallout Dates
This table lists the 45 “seeds” that we use to construct MNIR-generated exposure categories and term sets.
The last two columns report how many automatically generated terms we retain and drop after judgmental
pruning. We combine closely related exposure categories in our downstream analysis, as indicated by those
with the same font color.

29

Next, we manually prune the automatically generated term sets, deleting highly
generic terms and those at high risk of referring to other concepts (as fully described in
appendix C.1). Continuing with the tantalum example, we delete “adjoining countries,”
“requirements for companies,” and “sheet.” Table 3 reports the number of deleted and
retained terms in each category. We also combine closely related categories such as
“Software and Hardware Products” and “Software Services,” and we drop the “Manufacturing” category because it generates firm-level exposure measures that are highly
correlated with those generated by other, more focused categories. After combining
categories and pruning, we have 934 terms in 38 categories.
Lastly, we compute firm-level exposures to each category j and its associated term
P
set, L(j), as zij = v∈L(j) xi,v |b1,v |, which captures the part of the sufficient reduction
projection that derives from terms in L(j). Table B.3 reports descriptive statistics for
the resulting firm-level exposures for each category j. Some categories contain terms
that appear in the RF texts of relatively few firms (e.g., “Gambling,” 9% of firms),
whereas others appear in the RF texts of most firms (e.g., “Web-Based Services,” 68%).
Cross-firm exposure variation within categories is typically large.

5.3

Applying the new exposure measures

Table 4 reports abnormal return regressions on pandemic fallout days using the MNIRgenerated exposure measures as explanatory variables. We fit (3) to the same data as in
Column (1) of Table 1 except for using 38 MNIR-generated exposure measures rather
than the 36 measures derived from expert-curated dictionaries. As in Table 1, we
express explanatory variables in standard deviation units. A first key result is that the
MNIR-generated exposures yield a large gain in fit: The adjusted R2 increases from
0.33 in Column (1) of Table 1 to 0.41 in Column (1) of Table 4. In other words, our
MNIR-generated categories and measures outperform the expert dictionary approach,
even when using about the same number of explanatory variables.
A second key result is that our MNIR-based measures capture much of the overall

30

fit gain achieved by the full-blown MNIR implementation. When using the same firms
and pandemic fallout days, the MNIR forward regression yields an adjusted R2 value
of 0.50. To be sure, that is a substantial fit gain relative to Column (1) in Table 4. By
itself, however, the forward regression has little interpretation value. Embedded within
the sufficient reduction projection that drives the strong fit of the forward regression
are more than 18,000 terms that appear in the RF corpus and receive non-zero weight
in the inverse regression. In contrast, Column (1) reports a regression based on 38
exposure measures and 934 terms. Moreover, each category involves a collection of
related terms that, in most cases, offer ready interpretations.
Table 4 offers a rich account of how bad pandemic news drives the structure of
firm-level abnormal returns. Exposures to “Traditional Retail” and “Card Payments”
involve negative returns, while exposure to “Ecommerce” involves positive returns – in
line with the pandemic-induced shift in consumer spending from traditional retail to
online modes. Other results reflect major shifts in consumer spending across types of
non-durable goods and services. For example, exposures to “Foodstuffs” and “Restaurants” generate positive and negative returns, respectively, in line with a shift from
market to home production of meals. “Video Games” is associated with positive returns, while “Gambling” and “Aircraft + Travel” are associated with negative returns,
reflecting a major shift across entertainment and recreation activities.
Downstream demand shocks are also key drivers of return reactions to pandemic
news. For example, exposures to “Alternative Energy” and “Energy Infrastructure
+ Oil and Gas” are associated with negative returns, while the opposite is true for
exposures to the technology supply chain as captured by “Raw Metals and Minerals,”
“Electronic Components and Devices,” and “Web-Based Services.” The magnitudes
of the estimated coefficients on these exposure measures for intermediate goods and
services are comparable to the ones for categories that capture spending on final consumption goods.

Table 4: Regression Results Using MNIR-Generated Exposures,
Pandemic Fallout Days
Each column considers 38 MNIR-generated exposure measures for pandemic fallout dates. We
also include log market cap and leverage. Additionally, columns 1 and 2 (3) consider 2-digit (4digit) NAICS codes to introduce industry fixed effects and to cluster errors. For columns 2 and
3, we drop 4-digit NAICS codes with less than 5 companies. t stats are reported in parentheses;
and, for presentation purposes, we omit the coefficients on exposures that are not significant at
the 0.1 level. The pandemic fallout dates are Feb. 24, 25, 27 and March 03, 05, 11, 16, 18, 27. As
a benchmark, note that estimating MNIR with all terms achieves an adjusted R2 of 0.502 in the
analogue forward regression.

32

Financial exposure categories also also important. “Mortgages” generates negative returns, as do other property-related exposures like “REITs” and “Residential
Construction.” Exposure to “Financial Management” is also associated with negative
return reactions. In contrast, exposures to “Banking + Deposits” and “Investment
Funds” yield positive return reactions. A plausible explanation is that bad news about
the pandemic drove greater precautionary savings and more concern about managing
portfolio risks among higher-income households.
We can also produce a model-based explanation for any particular firm’s return
reactions by combining its exposure measures with the estimation results. Consider
Plains All American Pipeline, which had an average daily abnormal return of -6.4%
on pandemic fallout days as compared to -1.1% for the average firm. The Column (1)
model in Table 4 predicts a daily abnormal return of -5.9% for Plains. The model
attributes the company’s sharply negative performance on pandemic fallout days to its
heavy exposure to “Energy Infrastructure + Oil and Gas,” “REITs,” and “Alternative
Energy” and its light exposure to categories associated with positive returns.
Column (3) in Table 4 includes NAICS4 industry effects in place of NAICS2 effects.
For comparison, column (2) reports results using NAICS2 effects on the same sample
as in column (3). Some exposure measures become insignificant, but most remain
significant and a few previously insignificant ones become significant. The implication
is that our MNIR-generated exposure measures are not simply a proxy for industry
categories. Instead, they capture and explain important differences in firm-level return
reactions within narrowly defined industries.
In sum, bad COVID-19 news generates a wide array of positive and negative return
reactions across firms. The richness of the RF corpus enables us to uncover dozens of
separate effects that play a role in driving the structure of return reactions, including
effects that reflect demand shocks induced by social distancing and those that involve
indirect exposures via supply-chain linkages.

5.4

An Application to Super Tuesday

To illustrate its flexibility and power, we now apply our approach to explain and interpret firm-level equity returns in reaction to Super Tuesday. This application captures
the impact of the attendant shift in expectations about future government policy due
to changes in the likelihood of a Biden, Sanders or Trump Presidency, expectations
about what policies Biden would pursue to secure the Democratic nomination, and
expectations about the Trump campaign’s policy agenda in response to the now-likely
prospect of facing Biden in the general election contest.
Table B.4 reports the RF terms most associated with positive and negative return
reactions to Super Tuesday. Terms related to hotels and gambling (“hotel properties,” “casino,” “las vegas”) and fossil fuels (“natural gas,” “oil,” “permian basin”) are
among those highly associated with negative returns, while terms associated with real
estate more broadly (“tenants,” “reit,” “undeveloped land”) and healthcare (“health
insurance,” “medicare,” “patients”) are highly associated with positive returns. Recall
that “reit” and “oil” are influential predictors of negative returns on pandemic fallout
days. They remain highly influential in explaining reactions to Super Tuesday but in
the opposite direction, illustrating how we capture distinct firm-level return reactions
to different types of shocks. These results also illustrate the power of text to disentangle countervailing effects. Generic property terms predict positive return reactions to
Super Tuesday, while terms relating to the hotels and gambling segment of the property market predict negative reactions. Perhaps not coincidentally, President Trump
has major business interests that involve hotels and gambling.
Table B.5 reports firms for which MNIR yields the largest fit gains relative to a
no-text model. All five firms with the largest negative predicted reactions are in the
oil and gas sector. Terms like “crude,” “refinery,” “offshore,” and “drilling” are most
responsible for driving these predictions. Two firms with large positive reactions facilitate government-sponsored healthcare (eHealth and Centene Corp), two are involved
in mining (Coeur Mining Inc and Gold Resource Corp), and one is an industrial prop-

34

erty developer (Griffin Industrial Realty). In each case, the terms associated with large
positive returns relate naturally to the company’s main business activity.
Next, we select 47 seeds (listed in Table B.6) and, as before, use them to construct
term sets that define exposure categories. We obtain 666 automatically generated terms
and prune 215 of them, as set forth in appendix C.2. Note that a given seed need not
yield the same term set for Super Tuesday as for pandemic fallout days, because the
estimated MNIR models differ. For example, the “ecommerce” seed yields 23 terms on
pandemic fallout dates but just 3 on Super Tuesday (before manual pruning), because
few terms semantically related to e-commerce are associated with negative returns on
Super Tuesday. Nevertheless, several seeds yield similar term sets for Super Tuesday
and pandemic fallout days, e.g., “travel,” “reit,” and “gaming.”
We also uncover many distinct exposure categories for Super Tuesday. These include “Drilling Activity” and “Fracking,” which describe specific fossil fuel extraction
activities, in contrast to“Energy Infrastructure” and “Oil and Gas.” Other examples
include “Defense Technology” (military hardware), “Financial Instruments” (derivatives and hedging), “Government Healthcare” (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) and “Waste
Disposal.” Another notable category is “Financial Regulation,” a concept also present
in the baseline dictionaries and correlated with Super Tuesday return reactions in Table 1. By and large, our MNIR-generated exposure categories for Super Tuesday add
detail and nuance to concepts like healthcare, energy, finance, and real estate present
in the baseline dictionaries. In contrast, our MNIR-generated exposure categories for
pandemic fallout days are often quite distinctive and absent from the baseline dictionaries. Examples include categories for cloud computing, web services, and material
inputs to the technology supply chain.
Table 5 presents the abnormal returns regression for Super Tuesday based on the
new exposure categories. We again find a sizable fit gain compared to a model that
relies on the baseline dictionaries: the adjusted R2 rises from 0.199 in Column (4) of
Table 1 to 0.242 in Column (1) of Table 5, roughly one-third of the gain in adjusted R2
from using the full-blown MNIR model (0.349). Many exposure categories remain sta35

tistically significant after controlling for NAICS4 effects, again showing that variation
in RF texts across firms captures within-industry shifts in expected future earnings.

Concluding Remarks

We exploit the Risk Factors texts in 10-K filings to investigate how market-moving
shocks interact with prior risk exposures to drive the structure of firm-level equity
returns. We focus on 17 trading days with large market-level moves from late February
to the end of March 2020. These 17 days exhibit enormous dispersion in firm-level
returns in reaction to news about COVID-19, monetary and fiscal policy, the Super
Tuesday Democratic primary elections, and the oil price crash of 9 March.
Our text-based models explain up to half the variation in firm-level returns on these
days. Bad pandemic news triggers large negative abnormal return reactions for firms
with high exposures to travel, lodging, traditional retail, energy, aircraft production,
residential construction, REITs and restaurants, among others. The same news triggers
positive abnormal return reactions for firms with high exposures to drug trials, ecommerce, basic foodstuffs, web-based services, video games, financial management,
and metals and minerals that feed into supply chains for semiconductors, electrical
equipment and cloud computing. Many of these reactions reveal powerful effects of
downstream demand shocks on upstream suppliers. Examples include aircraft and
energy, harmed by the fall in travel demand, and positive return reactions for suppliers
to firms that saw demand increases due to social distancing and the shift to working
from home. Other market-moving news – such as monetary and fiscal policy actions
or the Super Tuesday election outcome – generate quite different firm-level return
reactions, which we also characterize using our text-based methods.
The pandemic-induced return reactions we uncover foretell shifts in the real economy. Examples include major job losses in the traditional retail sector, employment
gains at online shopping and delivery firms, a persistent collapse in air travel, job cuts
in aircraft production, numerous bankruptcies among oil and gas companies, a collapse
of advertizing revenue in print media, and surging demand for cloud computing.13 Our
results also square with evidence that COVID-19 accelerated ongoing shifts to digital
13

2020c), (Financial Times, 2020b), (Financial Times, 2020a) discuss the others.

services and remote interactions across a whole host of activities. Indeed, the share of
new U.S. patent applications that advance technologies to support video conferencing,
telecommuting, remote interactivity, and working from home doubled in the wake of
the pandemic (Bloom et al., 2020). Managing the social and economic fallout of these
shifts will present major policy changes for many years.
In terms of methodology, we draw on two text-analytic approaches often seen as
alternatives: expert-curated dictionary methods and supervised machine learning. By
combining elements of both, we obtain rich models that (a) fit better than models
based on expert-curated dictionaries, (b) uncover new, empirically relevant exposure
categories missed by the curated dictionaries and, at the same time, (c) deliver interpretable patterns in the estimated structure of firm-level returns. This last feature
pushes the supervised ML approach from prediction to interpretation.
Our hybrid approach starts with Taddy’s (2013, 2015) MNIR implementation of
supervised ML. We use a fitted MNIR model to identify influential “seed” terms. For
each seed, we build term sets based on similarity of linguistic context in the Risk Factors texts and relationship to firm-level returns. These term sets effectively define
exposure categories, which we apply to the Risk Factors texts to quantify firm-level
exposures. The resulting firm-level measures then serve as explanatory variables in
return regressions that yield readily interpretable results. While retaining elements of
a conventional dictionary-based approach, our hybrid approach leans lightly on domain
expertise. It completely sidesteps the laborious construction of expert-curated dictionaries. It also foregoes any reliance on external libraries, as in some NLP methods. As
illustrated by our separate applications to pandemic fallout days and Super Tuesday,
our hybrid approach is also flexible and adaptable. We hope it will prove useful in
many other applications.

Sample and Feature Space Construction

A.1

Sample of firms

The following are the details on how we construct our analysis sample:
• We link 3,154 firms (i) with at least one 10-K filing (with a non-empty Part 1a)
from January 2010 to July 2016, and (ii) with equity return data for all business
days between Feb 24, 2020 and March 27, 2020.
• We remove 19 firms with no leverage information.
• In order to compute abnormal returns, we first need to get estimates of stocklevel betas. Hence, we keep stocks for which we have at least 125 daily return
observations in 2019. We lose 28 firms in this step.
• We also drop small caps: either because they are in the first quartile of equity
market value or because their share price is smaller than 5 dollars on February
21, 2020 (i.e. the last trading day before the stock market jump days we consider
in this paper). Dropped small caps account for 2.5 percent of total equity market
value in the sample. In this step, we remove 968 firms.
• We discard 5 companies with no available NAICS2 code in our dataset. Finally,
we keep only NAICS2 codes with at least 5 companies. We drop one firm in this
last step.
• We end up with an analysis sample of 2,155 stocks for 2,133 companies.

A.2

Text preprocessing details

Our feature space construction begins with 10Ks from 2010 to 2016 scraped from
EDGAR for 3,580 unique firms. Some of these firms are not part of our final sample,
as explained above, we use them because they are potentially informative about the
structure of language in the Risk Factors texts.
44

We first find and replace meaningful phrases in the 10-K corpus with a single term
in the feature space. For example, ‘We owe additional income tax’ becomes ‘We owe
additional income tax’, where ‘income tax’ is treated as an individual term. This
ensures that the meaning conveyed by key phrases is retained in our analysis. These
phrases come from multiple sources:
1. 433 phrases from the baseline dictionaries in Baker et al. (2019).
2. 3,803 phrases that correspond to named entities that appear more than 25 times
in the corpus. We identify these entities with the named entity recognizer (NER)
from the Stanford NLP group. The NER finds an additional 63 entities that also
appear in the dictionaries, and so are redundant.
3. 9,649 additional multi-word expressions (MWE). To identify these, we first tag all
words in the corpus using a part-of-speech tagger from the Stanford NLP group,
and then tabulate tag patterns likely to correspond to meaningful sequences
Justeson and Katz (1995). Our final set of MWE is the resulting trigrams that
appear more than 150 times in the corpus, and bigrams that appear more than
500 times. This approach finds an additional 68 phrases also present in the
dictionaries, and 265 phrases also present in named entities, and so are redundant.
We then follow standard steps to complete pre-processing:
• Lowercase all text (case-folding).
• Tokenize text by breaking it into individual terms. Continuing from the above
example, the tokenized representation of ‘We owe additional income tax’ would
be the four-element list [‘we’, ‘owe’, ‘additional’, ‘income tax’].
• Drop common words from a standard stopword list, e.g. ‘for’, ‘to’, etc.
• Drop any terms that appear in the Risk Factors text of fewer than 25 firms from
2010 to 2016.

Table B.1: Descriptive statistics
All statistics are unweighted and, except for log market cap and leverage, reported in percents. Sample
sizes for returns and market cap refer to the 17 dates used in our regression models for returns.

Figure B.5: Adjusted R2 for Baseline and Complete Dictionaries
The horizontal axis displays the adjusted R2 from 17 separate OLS regressions of
abnormal returns on firm controls and the baseline exposures, one for each day that
enters the event groupings. These baseline exposures are computed using the 244
terms in Baker et al. (2019) that appear in the preprocessed RF corpus. The vertical
axis displays the adjusted R2 from the same regressions but with the dictionary
exposures computed using the 430 terms that appear in the original dictionaries.
The inclusion or not of rare terms is inconsequential for goodness-of-fit.

Figure B.6: Comparison of Fitted Values on 24 February and 9 March
This figure plots fitted values from (3) and (4) estimated on 24 February (left panel) and 9 March 9
(right panel). These days have the lowest and highest R2 values, respectively, under the dictionary
approach. The black solid lines are fitted regressions, and the dashed line is the 45 degree line. The

Figure B.7: Comparing Fitted Values between Approaches without Sector Fixed Effects
This figure plots fitted values from regressions (3) and (4) without NAICS2-level fixed effects. The sufficient
reduction project in (4) is built from coefficient estimates in the inverse regression model (2) that also does not
include NAICS2 effects. The left panel plots the fitted values from both approaches across all days, and the
right panel plots the fitted values for a day on which the fitted returns do not display a one-for-one relationship.
The black solid lines are fitted regression lines, and the dashed line is the 45 degree line.

The top half of the table lists the 30 terms with the highest and lowest estimated coefficients in the MNIR model fit to pandemic
fallout days, after screening out terms that appear in the RF texts of more than two-thirds of firms. The bottom half weights
the MNIR coefficient by the corresponding term’s tf-idf score, computed as xv log( 2133
dfv ) where xv is the count of term v in the
RF corpus and dfv is the number of firms that use term v in any of their RF texts. We then display the top and bottom 30

This figure considers ten firms with the greatest gain in fit by adding the sufficient reduction projection to a model
fit to data for the 9 pandemic fallout jump days listed in the notes to Table 1. We consider security-level averages
over these jump days and obtain predicted values for abnormal returns for each indicated specification. Dot colors
show the firm’s industry. For firms with multiple equity securities, we retain the one with the highest market cap
on 21 February 2020.
