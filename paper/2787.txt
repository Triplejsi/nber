THE DYNAMICS OF LIVING ARGEMENTS OF THE ELDERLY
ABSTRACT

This paper uses a new data set to study the choice of living arrange-

ments of some 3000 Massachusetts elderly between 1982 and 1986. The data
have a number of unique features; they are longitudinal and combine detailed
information on health with information on economic status and family relations.

This paper considers the influence on living arrangements of alternative

measures of health (subjective versus functional abilities versus diagnosed
condition), incomes and marital status of parents, and the number and

sexes of children. It also examines the extent to which changes in health
and the death of a spouse trigger changes in living arrangements and how
rapidly such changes occur.
The main findings of the paper are:

Functional ability indices are very good predictors of living
arrangements.
Subjective health reports are poor predictors of living arrangements.

The probability of institutionalization declines rapidly with the
income of the elderly.
In the cases of the older old daughters are much more likely than
sons to share living quarters.

Living arrangements are fairly stable. When changes in living arrangements occur they are often triggered by changes in health status or
the death of a spouse.
When deterioration in health status or the death of a spouse leads
to a change in living arrangements, such changes typically occur
within a year of the triggering event.

1. Introduction1

The choice of a living arrangement —

the

choice among

living

as an

independent household, living with adult children or other related or

unrelated persons, and living in an institution — has many implications
for the well—being of an elderly person. Changes in living arrangements,
such as moving in with children, are likely to be associated with changes

in the level of care and assistance received by the elderly. Changing
living arrangements, if it involves sale of homes by the elderly, may also

affect the liquid wealth of the elderly.2 Living arrangements may also
affect the elderly's eligibility for certain types of government
assistance, such as food stamps and supplemental social security.
This paper analyses the choice of the elderly to live in one of three
different living arrangements: living independently, living together with

relatives or others, and living in an institution. The paper explores the
roles of different health measure (subjective rating versus functional
ability versus actual conditions), income, marital status, and the number

and sexes of children in determining living arrangements. The paper also
examines factors that trigger changes in living arrangements and the length
of time between such triggering events and the change in living
arrangements.

The paper continues a line of research on determinants of living

arrangements of the aged. Schwartz, Danziger and Smolensky (1984) employ
the Retirement History Survey (RIIS) to estimate a binary choice model

between living independently and dependently, that is, living in another

household, most commonly that of children. In spite of the size of this
data set, their empirical results were mixed, and neither health nor income

—2—

effects are very strong. The poor results on health variables reflect the
very limited health information available in the 8115. Boersch—Supan
(1988a) estimates a multinomial logit model of living arrangements using
data from the Annual Housing Survey (AilS) that distinguish several

dependent living arrangements. However, as in the paper by Schwartz,
Danziger and Smolensky, the data preclude an analysis of

institutionalization. In contrast, Carber (1988) concentrates on the
determinants of institutionalization and its length using the Channeling

Demonstration. He emphasizes the importance of functional ability
measures, income, and the existence of children when measuring the risk of

institutionalization. Kotlikoff and Morris (1987, 1988) analyze the
importance of family links. They stress the role of "supply side
variables" that characterize the children in addition to the commonly
employed attributes of the elderly.
Papers by Ellwood and Kane (1988) and Boersch—Supan (l988b) represent
more comprehensive analyses of living arrangements that include both

institutionalized and non—institutionalized elderly. Their papers use the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and draw similar conclusions. Male
and non—white elderly are more likely to live with children than female or

white elderly. They also find a significant income—sensitivity against
nursing homes. Despite very different dynsmic econometric models, both
papers detect an increasing isolation of the elderly with the proportion of
elderly living alone or living in nursing homes increasing through time.
Except for the papers by Carber and Kotlikoff and Morris, studies of
living arrangements suffer from a less than satisfactory description of

health. This paper is based on a data set that is quite limited in terms

of geographic scope —

it

is restricted to Massachusetts elderly —

but

it

—3—

has advantages not shared by other data sets commonly used in research on
elderly, such as the PSID, the AIlS, and even the RHS. In addition to being
longitudinal, it combines a wide array of health information with data on
economic status, household characteristics, and family relations.
The main questions addressed in this paper are:

What are typical sequences of living arrangements in old age?
How often do elderly transit between their home, rheir children,
and an institution?
Which events precipitate changes in living arrangements?
What are the dynamics of living arrangements after the death of a
spouse or a deterioration of health?
What is types of health information are most valuable for
predicting living arrangements?
Is the economic status of the elderly an important determinant of
their living arrangement?
Is the probability that the elderly move in with their children
greater if the child (children) are female?
The main findinga of the paper are:

Functional ability indices are very good predictors of living
arrangements.
Subjective health reports are poor predictors of living
arrangements.
The probability of institutionalization declines rapidly with
the income of the elderly.
In the case of the older old daughters are much more likely than
sons to share living quarters.

Living arrangements are fairly stable. When changes in living
arrangements occur they are often triggered by changes in health
status or the death of a spouse.
When deterioration in health status or the death of a spouse
leads to a change in living arrangements, such changes typically
occur within a year of the triggering event.

The paper is organized as follows. We first describe the data,
explain the construction of the certain explanatory variables, particularly

health variables, and present basic sample characteristics. Next, in
Section 3, we provide a descriptive analysis of living arrangement choices

in our sample. The presentation includes the frequencies of living
arrangements in each wave of the panel as well as the frequencies of the

choice sequences over time. Section 4 is devoted to cross—sectional
analysis and to an assessment of alternative health variable as explanatory

variables. In Section 5, s dynamic analysis characterizes the determinants
leading to certain living arrangement sequences snd their lead and lag

structure. Section 6 investigates cohort effects, Section 7 considers the
difference between elderly with and without children, and Section 8

discusses differences between the younger and the oldest old. The final
section summarizes and draws conclusions.

2. Data, Variable Definitions, and Basic Sample Characteristics
The paper uses data from the Survey of the Elderly collected by the

Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the Aged (HRCA). This survey is part of
an ongoing panel survey of elderly in Massachusetts that begsn in 1982.

Initially, the ssmple consisted of 4040 elderly, aged 60 and above. In
addition to the baseline interview in 1982, reinterviews were conducted in

1984, 1985, and 1986. The sample is strstified and consists of two
populations. The first population represents about 70 percent of the
ssmple and was drawn from a rsndom selection of communities in Msssa—

chusetts. This first subsample is in itself highly stratified to produce
an overrepresentation of the very old. The second population that
comprises the remaining 30 percent is drswn from elderly participants of

—5—

the 27 Massachusetts home health care corporations. In the second
population the older old are also overrepresented. The sample selection
criteria, sampling procedures and exposure rates are described in more
detail in Morris et.al. (1987) and Kotlikoff and Morris (1987).
Although the 1982 sample did not include institutionalized elderly,
subsequent surveys have followed the elderly as they moved, including moves

into and out from nursing homes. This gives us the opportunity to estimate
a quite general model of living arrangement choice including the process of

institutionalization. However, care is necessary in estimating such a
model. In a study of living arrangements that includes the choice of
institutionalization, the first—period sampling of only non—institutionalized elderly considerably complicates the statistical analysis because

sample selection is endogenous with respect to institutionalization. In
cross—section analysis, we therefore employ estimation methods that are
robust against bias from choice—based sampling; in longitudinal analysis,
we condition on not being institutionalized in the first period.

We use several working samples. Our basic working sample consists of
all elderly with completed interviews in 1982 and with completed interviews

or deceased in 1986. Sample attrition between 1982 and 1986 was about 25
percent, not counting deaths, resulting in a basic working sample of 3077

elderly. Of these, 746 died between 1982 and 1986. Not all of these
elderly have completed interviews in between these years; particularly, in

1985, only about half of the elderly were re—interviewed. In addition,
living arrangements could not be ascertained for all elderly. Thus, most
of our longitudinal analysis relies on a much smaller sample of 1196
elderly.

—6—

In addition to basic demographic information collected in the baseline
interview, each wave of the HRCA

panel

contains questions about the

elderly's current marital status, living arrangements, income, and number

and proximity of their children. The surveys pay particular attention to
health status, recording the existence and of diagnosed conditions and
determining an array of functional (dis—)abilities.

Table 1 presents the age distribution of the elderly at baseline in

1982. The average age is 78.5, 78 percent are age 75 or more, and 20
percent are age 85 or more. In the U.S. noninstitutionalized population 60
and over, the fraction age 75 or more is .279, while the fraction over age

85 is .055. The overrepresentation of the oldest old in our sample is
indicated by the impressive number of 8 centenarians in our sample!

Because the sample overrepresents the very old, it is also characterized by

a very large proportion of women. In 1982, 68.7 percent of the interviewed
elderly were female; in 1986, this percentage had risen to 70.7 percent.

The lover part of Table 2 gives some impression about family

relationships and the isolation of some of the elderly. In 1982, 32.9
percent of the elderly in the HRCA baseline sample were married, 55.0

percent widowed. Four years later, 26.7 percent of the surviving elderly
were married and 61.4 percent were widowed. As of 1986, 41.4 percent of
the elderly report no children 15.2 one, 17.8 two, 12.7 three, and 12.8
percent four or more children. Because the elderly in the sample are quite
old, some of their children are elderly themselves, and some children may

even have died earlier than their parents. 47.0 percent of the elderly
have siblings who are still alive. 25.5 percent of all elderly report that
they have no relatives alive at all, and 39.3 percent report that they have
no friends.

—7—

Average yearly income rises between 1984 and 1986 from $8,750 to

$10,500. This 20 percent increase is larger than the concomitant growth in
average income for the general population which was only 13.2 percent. It
is interesting to note that elderly without children have a significantly
lower income ($7,500) than elderly with at least one child ($9,500) in

1984, although in 1986, this difference becomes much smaller ($9,700 as
opposed to $10,750).

One of the major strengths of the HRCA survey is its detailed

information on the health status of the elderly. Three kinds of health
measures are coded: a subjective health index, an array of actual

conditions, and an array of functional ability measures. The subjective
health index (SIJ&JH) is coded "excellent" (1), "good" (2), "fair" (3), or
"poor" (4).

Seven actual health conditions are reported (cancer, mental illness,

diabetes, stroke, heart disease, hypertension, and arthritis). Three
states are scored as: "not present" (0), "present but does not cause

limitation" (1), end "present and causes limitation" (2). These conditions
are condensed in two summary measures, ILLSIJM and ILLMAX:

iLLSUM — CANCER+MENTAL+DIAZ+STROKE÷HEART+HYPERT+ARTHR

ILU(AX — max (CANCER ,MENTAL, DI,STROKE, HEART, HYPERT , ARTHR)

Finally,

six measures are being used to describe functional ability.

In

addition to a dummy variable

to

walk, three ADL's (MEDS: can take own

that indicates whether a person is unable
medications,

PCARE: can do own

personal care, and BLADD: can control bladder) and two IADL's (MEALS: can

prepare own meals, and HOUSW: can do normal housework) are reported. These

—8—

variables can attain five values, representing "could do on own", "needs
some help sometimes", "needs some help often", "needs considerable help",
snd "cannot do st all" with associated codes from 0 to 4, except for the
variable BLADD that has only four categories ("intact","limited control",

"needs helper", and "incontinent") coded from 0 to 3. From these six
indicators, two summary measures of functional ability, ADLSUM and ADLIND,
were constructed:

ADLSUM — WALK + HOIJSW+MEALS + MEDS+PCARE+BLADD
and
ADLIND — 1

if ADLSUM — 0

2 if ADLSUM
3

1 but none of the following applies:

1 and both IADL's in worst category
2 and only one IADL in worst category
or ADLSUM 3 and at least one IADL not intact
if ADLSUH
or ADLSIJN

4 if ADLSUM

or

S

ADLSUN

if ADLSUM
or ADLSIJM

1 and at least two ADL's not intact

4 and only one ADL not

intact

1 and at least two ADL's in worst category
3 and only one ADL in worst category

Table 2 presents sample averages of the health measures for those

elderly who stayed in the sample from 1982 through 1986.2 Almost all
conditions show an increasing incidence, particularly so the group of

mental illnesses. The deterioration of actual health is also reflected in
the functional ability indexes and in the ADL and IADL indicators.

However, it is quite remarkable to note that the subjective health index

stays virtually unchanged from 1982 to 1986. This is in sharp contrast to
the deterioration of health as indicated by the condition variables, most
clearly displayed by the summary measure ILLSUM.

—9—

In order to further investigate the three kinds of health measures,
Table 3 displays chi—square teats of the correlationa among the various

health meaaurea. The null hypotheais of these teats is that the two health
measures are independent. In the Table a value larger than the critical
value in parentheses indicatea a significant correlation. The first two
rows show that the two variants of the index for actual conditions (ILLMAX
and ILLSUN) and the two variants of the functional ability index (ADLSUM

and ADLIND) are very closely associated. A tight correlation also exists
between the indexes for functional ability and actual condition. However,
no statistically significant correlation can be found between the
subjective health index (SUBJH) and the indexes for functional ability as

well as the indexes for actual conditions. This result appears to provide
a rather strong warning against the use of subjective health evaluations as
proxies for actual health status.

3. A Descriptive Analysis of Living Arrangements
The main dependent variable in this paper is the choice of living

arrangements. In this section, we define the living arrangement categories
used in the analysis and describe the observed frequencies of living

arrangements. We present these frequencies for each of the survey waves as
well as longitudinally in form of a tabulation of observed choice—
sequences.

Although the sample was initially drawn from the non—institutionalized
population, subsequent surveys have followed the elderly as they moved,

including moves into and out from institutions. The kind of institution
was very carefully recorded in the survey instrument. In addition, in each
wave the non—institutionalized elderly were asked who else was living in

—10—

their home. With this information, four categories of living arrangements
can be distinguished:

— Independent living arrangements: the elderly's household does not
contain any other person beside the elderly individual and his/her spouse,
if any (living arrangement type 1).

— Shared living arrangements: the elderly's household contains at
least one other adult person beside the elderly individual and his/her
spouse. Two cases can be distinguished:
— — The household contains only the elderly, his/her spouse, and the
immediate family of his or her children, including a child—in—law (living
arrangement type 2).
— — The household contains at least one other related or unrelated
person (living arrangement type 3).

— Institutional living arrangements: This category includes elderly
who are living on a permanent basis in a health—care related facility
(living arrangement type 4). This living arrangement category comprises
the entire spectrum from hospitals and nursing homes to congregate housing
and boarding houses. Living arrangements are reported as of the day of
interview — therefore, temporary nursing home stays are not recorded
unless they happen to be at the time of interview. Rather, most nursing
home stays represent permanent living arrangements.3 It is important to
keep this in mind when comparing the frequency and risk of institutionalization in this paper with numbers in studies that focus on short—term
nursing home stays.
Table 4 presents the distribution of living arrangements in all four

waves of the HRCA panel. The frequencies in this table are strictly cross—
sectional and are based on all elderly who were living at the time of each
cross—section and whose living arrangements were known for this cross—
aection.

Moat remarkable is the decreasing, but very high proportion of elderly
living independently in spite of the very old age of most of the elderly in

the sample. About every sixth elderly shares a household with his or her
own children, whereas very few elderly share a household with distantly or

unrelated persons. The dramatic increase over time in the proportion of
institutionalized living arrangements reflects two effects that must be

—11—

carefully distinguished. Institutionalization increases because the sample
ages and health deteriorates as it became obvious from Table 2. But this
effect is confounded by the way the sample was drawn. In 1982, the sample
is non—institutionalized by design. Only a few elderly happened to become
institutionalized between the time of sample design and the actual

interview. Four years later, more than one fifth of the surviving elderly
live in an institution, almost all in a nursing home. Section 6 will
present a separation of these two effects. As of 1986, very few elderly
live in the "new forms of elderly housing, such as congregate housing or
continuing care retirement coimnunities.

For a longitudinal analysis, we extract from the working sample those
elderly who were interviewed in all 4 waves and whose living arrangements

could be ascertained in all waves or who deceased. Table 5 enumerates all
living arrangement sequences that are observed among the 1196 elderly in

this longitudinal sample. Many sequences are very rare.
A little less than half (47.8 percent) of the elderly maintain the

same living arrangement from 1982 through 1986. Another 21.0 percent died
before 1986 without an observed living arrangement transition. This
stability confirms the results by Boersch—Supan (l988b) and Ellwood and
Kane (1988).
About 40 percent of the sampled elderly lived independently from 1982

through 1986. Another 15.6 percent stayed lived independently until they
died prior to 1986. Another 24.6 percent lived for at least some time with
their children, and 21.1 percent experienced at least one stay in an
institution.

The most frequently observed transition is from living independently
to being institutionalized (sequences II1N, IINN, INNN, IIND, INND, and

—12—

INDD). These sequences are observed for 42.4 percent of eli elderly who
change their living arrangement at least once. Only 13.7 percent change
from living independently to living with their children (sequences luG,
11CC, ICCC, IICD, ICCD, and ICOD).

It should be emphasized once more that these frequencies are not

representative for the elderly population as a whole. The sample is not
random: it represents only those elderly that were not institutionalized at
the time of designing the sample, end it overrepresents the very old.

4. cross—Sectional Analysis of Living Arrangements
This section presents croas—aectionsl estimates 1984, 1985 and 1986 of
the probability of selecting one of the four living arrangement categories
defined above as functions of demographic characteristics, income, and

health. We are interested in the answer to three questions:

(1) Which health measure is the beat predictor of living arrangements?
(2) How income—sensitive is the choice of living arrangements?

(3) How does the presence of children affect the choice of living
arrangements? And is there a difference between daughters and sons?

We present five sets of estimation results, each referring to one of the
five health measures introduced in Section 2 (SUBJH, ILLSIJM, ILLMAX,

ADLIND, ADLSUM). We apply multinomial logit analysis:

Prob(i)

P(i/1) :—

log(

)

/si +

X'fi,

i—2, .

,4

Prob(1)

where we regress the log—odds ratio of all three dependent living
arrangements versus living independently on a constant

and on a vector X

—13—

that contains sex, age, the number of male and female children, marital
status, health, and income of the elderly.
One advantage of the multinomial logit functional form is its

robustness against bias from self—selection.4 As was pointed out in
Section 2, the asmple is choice—based because it excludes institutionalized
elderly at baseline and therefore overrepresents the non—institutionalized
population throughout the sample period, although to a decreasing degree.
The inclusion of a set of alternative—specific constants
the estimated coefficients

insures that

are consistent in spite of the endogeneity of

the sampling process.

Table 6 reports the results. Performance is indicated by one minus
the likelihood at the estimated parameter values divided by the likelihood

at zero parameter values (RHO — 1—LIK/LIKO) and by the percentage of
correct predictions (denoted by PCP). Asymptotic t—statistics are reported
in parentheses.

Our first finding is the poor performance of the subjective health

index as a predictor for living arrangement choice. SUBJH is insignificant
in all three choices in all four waves. The measures of fit, RHO and PCP,

for these logits are the lowest across all specifications. This result is
not too surprising in light of the lack of variation in SUBJH over time
(Table 2) and its poor correlation with actual health as indicated in Table
3.

A more important result, however, is the superior performance of the
functional ability indexes as opposed to summary measures of the presence

and severity of actual health conditions. Best results in terms of
performance (RHO and PCP) and significance can be achieved by using the
summary measure ADLSTJM that was defined by simply adding up the severity

—14—
codes of 6 ADL's and IADL's, Table 6 (e). If ADLSUM is included in
addition to either ILLSUM or ILLMAX, the coefficients of ADLSUM become even
larger and only slightly less significant, whereas

the variables indicating

actual health conditions remain insignificant.

The probability of institutionalization is strongly affected by a

deterioration of health and functional ability. Functional disability

also

has a strong effect in favor of living with children, less so with other

relatives. However, neither institutionalization nor living with children
is fully determined by health and functional ability. Income has a clear
negative influence on institutionalization, though this influence becomes

less pronounced the stronger is the health variable. Two important
conclusions follow. First, one should be careful in interpreting income
elasticities of institutionalization as long as health is not carefully

controlled for. Second, it appears that institutionalization is an
inferior living arrangement. Low income also increases the likelihood of
living with children, though this effect is less pronounced than the effect
on institutionalization.

The demographic characteristics perform as expected. Old age per se
has little influence on living arrangements once health is properly

taken

into account. If not, age works as a proxy for bad health and therefore
decreases the likelihood of living independently (for exsinple

in Table 6

(a) where health is measured by subjective rating).

Male elderly are more likely to live with their children whereas

female elderly appear to prefer living independently. There is no

clear

gender effect on institutionalization, although the coefficients of FEMALE,
when significant, are most often negative, indicating that all other things
equal male elderly are more likely to be institutionalized

than female

—15—

elderly. Marital status is an important predictor of living arrangement
choice even after correcting for age, sex, and health. Being single
strongly increases the odds against living independently.

The final variable of interest is the number of children. This is the
only "supply variable" included in the regressions. One effect is rather
trivial: the larger the number of children, the more likely is the

probability of living with one of them. There is some difference, however,
in the coefficients on the number of daughters and sons .

When the

difference between the coefficient on the number of male and female
children is statistically significant (this is the case in the 1986 cross—
section), both the coefficient and the significance level are larger for

daughters. This may reflect a preference of the elderly to live with their
daughters rather than with their sona, or a greater willingness by
daughters to live with their elderly parents.

5. Longitudinal Analysis of Living Arrangements
One of the advantages of the data set employed is its panel nature.
It enables us to study transitions and living arrangement sequences in
addition to the cross—sectional description and analyses of living
arrangements, and it makas it possible to identify cohort effects.

We next estimate a multinomial logit model where the dependent
variables are the more common choice sequences of Table S (such aa 1111 or
IIIC) and the independent variables are time—independent characteristics of
the elderly person (sex, age, number of children, income at baseline) as
well as a set of variables that describe changes in marital and health

status. Table 7 reports the results. In the Table MARRX1 is coded one
(zero otherwise)if the elderly person experienced the loss of a spouse

—16—

between periods 1 and 2, MARRX2 is coded one (zero otherwise) if this event
took place between period 2 and 3, and MARRX3 is coded one (zero otherwise)
if this event took place between period 3 and 4.

In the first panel of Table 7 health is measured by actual conditions
(variable ILLSUM, its changes denoted by ILLX1—ILLX3); in the second panel,

health is described by functional ability (variable ADLSUM, its changes
denoted by ADLXI—ADLX3).

As in the cross—sectional analysis, measuring health in terms of
functional ability yields a considerably better description of living
arrangement choices than using actual conditions. Changes in functional
ability have particularly strong effects on the risk of becoming
institutionalized, both when originally living independently (sequences

IIIN, IINN, INNN) and when living with own children (sequence CCCN). The
effect is less pronounced when measuring health as the sum of actual
conditions, but the relative pattern corresponds both in terms of magnitude
and significance.

The longitudinal analysis nicely identifies the lag structure of the

responses to health changes. In Table 7 (a), the contemporary effects
exceed the lagged or anticipated effects. Comparing the three sequences
IIIN, IINN, and IN1qN, that represent living arrangement transitions from

living independently to becoming institutionalized after the third, the
second and the first waves of the panel, respectively, we see that the
third health change variable (ILLX3), the second (ILI.X2), and the first
(ILLX1) is largest in IIIN, IINN, and INNN,respectively, and that the

coefficients of the lagged and anticipated effects decrease as the time

between living arrangement change and health change increases. The same

—17—

effect holds for the functional ability index ADLSUM, except for the INNN
sequence, Table 7 (b).

Similarly, the probability of being taken in by adult children is
strongly affected by changes in functional ability: sequence IIIC by ADLX3,

sequence ICCC by ADLXI. and ADLX2. The parallel effects in the condition

index ILLSUM are less pronounced. Also here, the lag and lead structures
appear to Indicate immediate responses to health changes rather than lagged
or anticipated reactions.

The loss of a spouse — the predominant change in marital status —

is

indicated by the set of MARRX1—3 variables. The results are as expected:
the loss of a spouse increases the probability of moving to the children

and, to a lesser degree, into institutions. Unfortunately, the evidence on
lag and lead structures is too weak to warrant reliable conclusions.

Elderly with higher incomes are unambiguously more likely to remain
independently for longer periods. This is indicated by the negative signs

of all income effects. The largest absolute income coefficients are on
long stays in nursing homes, sequences IINN and in particular sequence
INNN.

The variables FKIDS and MKIDS that permit living arrangement 2, living
with children, show clearly positive supply effects: a larger number of
children strongly increases the probability of long stays in this living
arrangement (sequences CCCC and CCCN). As in the cross—sectional analysis,
the number of daughters has a stronger impact on the likelihood of living

with children than the number of sons. In conjunction with the larger
probabilities of male elderly than female elderly of joining the household
of children (as indicated by the negative signs of the variable FEMALE if
significant), this is evidence that elderly fathers are most likely to be

—18—

taken in by their daughters, even after controlling for health, age, and
marital status.

Unlike in the cross—sectional analysis, old age per se decreases the
likelihood of living independently. There are two reasons for this.
First, since the longitudinal analysis employs only change—variables for

health, age may pick up the initial state of health. Second, age may also
pick up cohort differences. As we now demonstrate, the first effect
appears to dominate.

6. Cohort Effects
We now turn

to

the question of cohort effects. Has the risk of

institutionalization at a given age increased between 1982 and 1986? Has
the probability of being taken in by adult children decreased during this

time? Analyses using very long panel data answer these questions in the
affirmative (Boersch—Supan, l988b; Eliwood and Kane, 1988).

Analyzing cohort effects is not straightforward in this sample because

institutionalized living arrangements are underrepresented. Moreover, the
degree of underrepresentation differs among waves and is therefore

confounded with cohort membership. An example will explain this point.
Cohort 1902 is sampled in the baseline year 1982 at age 80. Due to the
sampling rules, only the non—institutionalized are included. However,
Cohort 1906 will be interviewed at the same age 80 in year 1986, that is,
four years later than baseline, and hence include at least those elderly

that became institutionalized between 1982 and 1986. This will still
underrepresent the proportion of institutionalized elderly of cohort 1906,

but to a lesser extent than that of cohort 1902. Hence, if we compare the
proportion of institutionalized elderly at age 80 of cohort 1902 with that

—19—

of cohort 1906, we cannot attribute the difference to a cohort effect since
it is at least partially due to sample selection.

However, two

cohort

effects can theoretically be identified in spite

of the sample selection problem. Table 8 looks at the distribution of
non—institutionalized living arrangements by different cohorts at the same

age. Because the sample of the non—institutionalized population is
exogenous, this avoids the above—mentioned identification problem, at the
cost of preventing an analysis of whether institutionalization became a
substitute for family support as suggested by Boersch—Supan (l988a, 1988b).
Indeed, Table 8 reveals no clear cohort effect in the choice of living
independently versus with children or other persons, conditional on not
becoming institutionalized.
A second way to avoid confusion with sample selection is to study

transition probabilities conditional on the initial state. Here, we
compare, say, the probability of a transition from being independent to

becoming institutionalized among different cohorts at the same age. The
problem with this approach is the small number of transitions observed, as

was shown in Table 5. This prevents simple cross—tabulations such as in
Table 8. Instead, we construct a sample of transitions from living
independently to the same or some other living arrangement. Starting from
the basic longitudinal working sample of 1196 elderly, we arrive at a
sample of 1800 transitions of elderly who initially live independently.

Some elderly experienced more than one transition. In this case, we assume
that the transitions are statistically independent from each other. We
then regress the probability of choosing a destination living arrangement
as functions of calendar year, controlling for age, sex, number of
children, health and income.

—20—

Table 9 presents the results. None of the cohort effects is
statistically significant, though the negative sign and the magnitude of

the coefficients is the same as in Boersch—Supan (1988b). The probability
of living with children or other related or unrelated persons decreases
with time relative to the probability of becoming institutionalized, and,
even more, relative to the probability of living independently, the

excluded category. The statistical insignificance may be due to the short
length of the panel (four years). In addition, the sample is dominated by
stayers: only 10.9 percent of the 1800 transitions represent actual changes
to another living arrangement; this decreases the precision of the
estimates.

7. Number and Sex of Children
The HRCA survey

shared

includes two variables that represent the supply of

housing: the number and sex of own children. This information is

available for all elderly whether they live with children or not. This is
in contrast to most other surveys (e.g., the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics; Boersch—Supan, l988b) where the existence of adult children can
only be inferred when elderly parents actually live together with their
children.

In order to assess whether the omission of this supply variable biases

the estimation results, we perform two tests. First, we stratify the
cross—sectional logit estimations by whether the elderly have children or
not (41.4 percent of the elderly in the sample have no children, 58.6
percent have at least one child); second, for those elderly who have
children, we run the logits with and without the variables FKIDS and MKIDS
that count the number of children by sex.

—21—

Table 10 reports the results. The corresponding values of the
loglikelihood function are as follows:

Variables FKIDS and MXIDS Excluded

(c)

(d)

—1082.82

— 931.98

The two strata are indeed significantly different. The hypothesis that
pooling the strata (column c) yields the same likelihood as the sunt of the

separate strata (columns a and b) is clearly rejected: the likelihood ratio
tests for the two health variables are 195.6 and 193.98, respectively, and
exceed the critical value of 26.22 (12 degrees of freedom, 99 percent

confidence). Moreover, inclusion of the supply variables FKIDS and MKIDS
results also in a statistically significant improvement of the likelihood
value, the respective likelihood ratio statistics sre 31.16 and 40.12,
exceeding the chi—squared critical value of 9.21 (2 degrees of freedom, 99
percent confidence).

However, the coefficient estimates of the other common variables are

surprisingly close. Although the numbers of sons and daughters is a
statistically significant and a numerically important determinant for the

choice of living arrangements —

increasing

the probability of living with

one of these children and decreasing the likelihood of institutionalization

— their omission leaves the coefficients of the other variables virtually
unchanged. Moreover, there is little difference between the two strata of

—22—

elderly with and without children, particularly so in the more reliable
model that includes functional ability as health measure.
The result is surprising insofar as the number of children may very

well be correlated with health and income of the elderly. However, this
correlation turns out to be very small, hence, omission of the number—of—
children variables reduces the fit of the regression, but does not bias the
other coefficients.

There are many other "supply variables" that are left Out in the logit

regressions of Table 6. The children are characterized only by number and
sex, but not by income, housing situation and family size of the adult

children. Evidence that these variables matter is indicated in Kotlikoff
and Morris (1988). In addition, high housing prices may induce earlier
household dissolution. Evidence to this effect is reported in Boersch—
Supan (1986) and Boersch—Supan (l988a). Finally, cost and availability
(local availability, waiting lines, congestion) of nursing homes may be an
important factor in the probability of institutionalization.

8. The Oldest Old
The sample was stratified in order to include a larger than

proportional share of the oldest old. Do these elderly behave differently
than the younger old? Table 11 presents estimates which correspond to
Table 6, parts (c) and (e), but stratify by two age groups: those elderly
who were less than age 80 at baseline, and those who were of age 80 or
older.

There are some important differences. First, the oldest old appear
more sensitive to changes in income and health. The respective
coefficients are numerically larger and more significant for this

—23—

subsample. Second, there is a much more pronounced difference between very
old male and female elderly than among younger elderly: the oldest male
elderly have a very strong preference for living in the household of their

children. Furthermore, the distinction between daughters and sons that was
already detected in Table 6 appears to be driven by the oldest old; among
younger elderly this distinction is statistically insignificant. Finally,
becoming widowed affects the behavior of the oldest old much more than the
younger old, strongly increasing the chances of the oldest old moving in
with their children.

9. Implications and Conclusions
The most frequent choice of living arrangement, even for the very old,

is to live independently. This finding confirms those of Boersch—Supan
(1988b) and by Eliwood and Kane (1988). Very few elderly move more than
once between 1982 and 1986. This includes "natural' sequences such as
independent—with children—nursing home or independent—nursing home—with

children. Among the 21.2 percent who changed their living arrangement
within the four years of the panel, the most frequent transition is from
living independently to a nursing home; this transition is about three
times as frequent as changing from independent living to living with
children.

The most important health information needed to predict living

arrangement changes is the functional ability of the elderly person. A
simple sum of six ADL and IADL measures performs quite well. The existence
and severity of actual health conditions are less successful as predictors,
and subjective health ratings are very poor instruments for the analysis of

living arrangements. There is a high correlation between functional

—24—

ability and actual illnesses, but no statistically significant correlation
between these measures and subjective health evaluations.
The death of a spouse or the deterioration of health has important

consequences for the choice of living arrangements. These events, if they
trigger changes in living arrangements, do so quite rapidly; if a change
of living arrangement is precipitated by one of these life—events, the

change typically takes place in the same year. This finding accords with
that in Boersch—Supan (1988b) which uses quite different data and
econometric methodology.

The economic status of the elderly is an important determinant for the

choice of living arrangement. Institutionalization is viewed as an
inferior living arrangement, as is living with children. This result
confirms the many studies on the income—sensitivity of the propensity to
live alone, as well as the work by Garber (1988) on income—aenaitivity of

institutionalization. This result holds even after correcting for health
in a satisfactory fashion as haa not been possible in moat earlier studies.

The inclusion of variables that account for the supply of dependent

living arrangement is important in terms of fit and prediction. This
result is in line with the research by Kotlikoff and Morris (1987, 1988).
However, omitting the number and sex of children does not appear to biaa
the measured influence of other living arrangement determinants such as

income or health. The number of children is particularly important for the
oldest old. For this group, those with daughters are more likely to live
with their children.
There is ample room for further research that would include more data
-on the characteristics of children and on housing and nursing home pricea.

The construction of housing and nursing home price indices is a project on

—25—
its own

as

is the collection of longitudinal data on the characteristics of

children. Fortunately, the HRCA panel is ongoing, and further waves ay
include more supply—side information.
