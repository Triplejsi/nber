December 1988
ESTIMATING THE AGE-PRODUCTIVITY PROFILE USING
LIFETIME EARNINGS
ABSTRACT

Understanding how productivity varies with age is important for a
variety of reasons. A decline in productivity with age implies that aging
societies must increasingly depend on the labor supply of the young and
middle age. It also means that policies designed to keep the elderly in the
work force, while potentially good for the elderly, may decrease overall
productivity. A third implication is that, absent government intervention,
employers may not be willing to hire the elderly for the same compensation
as younger workers. Labor economists are particularly interested in the
relationship of productivity and age because it can help test alternative
theories of the labor market.

This paper assumes risk neutral employers and estimates the age—
productivity relationship using the first order condition that the present
expected value of total compensation equals the present expected value of
productivity; workers hired at different ages have different present
expected values of total compensation, and, correspondingly, different
present expected values of productivity. Hence, if one psrameterizes the
age—productivity relationship, the parameters of this relationship can be
identified from information on how total present expected compensation
varies with age.
The data in the study are earnings histories for over three hundred
thousand employees of a Fortune 1000 corporation covering the period 1969—
1983. While the results may be subject to several biases and should be
viewed cautiously, they are fairly striking. For each of the five sex—
For young workers,
occupation groups, productivity falls with age.
compensation (earnings plus pension accrual) is below productivity and for
older workers compensation exceeds productivity. For several worker groups
the discrepancy between compensation and productivity is very substantial.

In addition to confirming some features of contrsct theory, the results
lend support to the bonding models of Becker and Stigler and Lazear which
suggest that firms use the age—earnings profile as an incentive device.

However, there

appear to he few, if any, economists who view the spot market theory as
reasonable.

My research with David Wise (Kotlikoff and Wise;

Such offsetting wage discontinuities are not, however,

evident in the data.
In contrast to the spot market theory, contract theories of labor
markets imply only a present value relationship between compensation and
productivity.

Consider, for example, the contracts that would he written by

risk neutral employers.

In these contracts, although earnings in any single

is the specific human capital model of Mincer (1964)

One such theory

and Becker (1971).

It

suggests that if firms sre free to fire older workers, the age—wage profile

will be structured such that earnings exceed productivity when young and
vice versa when old.

On the other hand, in Lazear's

(1979,

1981) agency

model of worker shirking, the worker receives less than her marginal product
when young, with the difference paid out in the form of wages, accrued
pension benefits, or severance pay in excess of the marginal product when
old.

The efficiency wage models of Harris and Todaro (1970),

Stofft (1984),

Yellen (1984), Stiglitz and Shapiro (1984),

end Bulow and Summers (1985)

represent a third view of the labor market.

These models stress the payment

of above market clearing wages, rather than the shape of the age—
compensation profile as an incentive device.

While there is equilibrium

unemployment in these models, they, like the spot market theory, predict
that workers are paid their marginal products at each age over the work
span.
The evidence to date on the age—productivity relationship is limited
and mixed.

The findings for older workers of Abraham and Madoff (1981) that

in
pay increases although indices of productivity decline, suggest wages
excess of marginal products toward the end of the work span.
Moore (1983)

Lazear and

report that the earnings profiles of the self—employed are

flatter than those of employees, also suggesting earnings in excess of
productivity among older employees.

Kahn and Lang (1986),

in contrast,

examine responses to questions concerning desired hours of work; they point
out that older workers, with earnings in excess of their marginal products,

—4—

are likely to be hours—constrained by their employers and, therefore, desire
to work more.

The opposite would be true if earnings of older workers is

below their marginal products.

Kahn and Lang's empirical findings support

the view that marginal productivity exceeds earnings for older workers.
This paper assumes risk neutral employers and estimates the age—
productivity relationship using the first order condition that the presenr
expected value of total compensation equals the present expected value of
productivity; workers hired at different ages have different present
expected values of total compensation and, correspondingly, different
present expected values of productivity.

Hence, if one parameterizes the

age—productivity relationship, the parameters of this relationship can be
identified from information on how total present expected compensation
varies with age.
The data in the study are earnings histories for over three hundred
thousand employees of a Fortune 1000 corporstion covering the period 1969 —

1983.

While the firm's name can not be disclosed, the firm is involved

primarily in sales.

These data are advantageous not only because one can

control for the firm, but also because one can determine precisely the
accrued pension compensation arising under the firm's defined benefit
pension plan.

At particular ages and amounts of service, pension

compensation in this firm is an important component of total compensation.
The results indicate that productivity declines with age and that
workers are paid more than they produce when old to offset being paid less
than they produce when young.

For some sex—occupation groups the difference

between productivity and compensation at young and old ages is very
sizeable.

The results support the bonding models of Becker and Stigler

(1974) and Lazear (1979,1981) as opposed to the efficiency wage models cited

There are, however, a number of reasons for viewing these results

Estimates of the Age—Productivity Profile

Section IV.

Table 3 presents the regression results from estimating (11') assuming

a 6 percent interest rate.

In the regression observations on workers hired

since pension accrual
only during the years 1970 through 1983 are included,
for workers hired prior to 1969 could not be determined.

All of the age—

squared and age—cubed coefficients reported in the Table are highly
significant.

MAny of the year dummies are also significant, suggesting that

the modeling of expectations of future Os may be important.

The regression

coefficients are little affected by the choice of interest rate; the
rates of both 3 percent and
regressions were repeated assuming interest

for the different occupation—sex groups at selected ages and ages

Table 1 indicates very substantial differences in job survival

rates across the five groups; 34.3 percent of male managers who hire on at
age 30 are predicted to remain with the firm 25 years later.

For male and

—15—

female office workers the comparable percentages are 21.5 and 14.2,
respectively.

For salesmen and saleswomen the respective percentages are

5.4 and 2.3.

The Table also demonstrates that workers hired at older ages,

at least through age

50, have larger probabilities

fin

of remaining in the

for a given period of time than workers hired at younger ages.
Table 2 indicates that the age of hire also is an important factor in
real wage growth.

According to the regression, workers hired at later ages

often experience greater real wage growth than workers hired at younger
ages.

In addition, wage growth for female office workers and saleswomen at

particular combinations of age and age of hire often exceeds that of their
male occupational counterparts.

A reduced form regression can help illustrate the shape of the age—
profile of the present expected value of compensation.

This regression

Figure 1 presents this profile for each of the five

Notice

that each of the normalized profiles of present expected compensation rises
at early ages at a decreasing rate,

suggesting, as indicated above, that

productivity rises with age at these ages.

In addition, each of the

profiles, except that of saleswomen, declines a decreasing rate in old age,

The Data and Emoirical Implementation

The large firm's data used in this study are earnings histories
covering the period 1969 through 1983 of workers employed in the firm at

—13—

some time during the period 1980 through 1983.

The workers ste classified

into three rather broad occupation and sex groups: male office workers,
female office workers, salesmen, saleswomen, and male managers.
too few female managers ro warrant their analysis.

There are

Unfortunately, there are

no additional demographic variables that could be included in the analysis.
The firm has a defined benefit plan with a fairly complex set of age—
and service—related benefits.

The benefit formula is a percent of earnings

formula in which the basic retirement annuity equals a percentage rate times
the number of years of service for workers with fewer than 26 years of
service.

For those with more service, the formula equals 25 times the

former percentage rate, plus the additional service beyond 25 times a lower
percentage rate.

The baaic benefit is offset by the amount of Social

Security benefits the firm predicts the worker will receive.

The predicted

Social Security benefit is derived from another age— and service—related
formula unique to the firm.
The pension plan's normal retirement age is 65, and its early
retirement age is 55.

For workers who retire after the early retirement

a special early
age, but before the normal retirement age, there is
retirement benefit reduction table that is based on the workers' age and
service.

Workers who terminate employment before age 55 are not eligible

for the quite generous early retirement benefit reduction rates and face
instead actuarially reduced benefits.

Another very important penalty for

is that for workers retiring
terminating before the early retirement age

after the early retirement age have their Social Security offset deferred
until they reach age 65.

These provisions of the firm's pension can produce

departing the firm is high, pR will be much less thsn unity, and a value of
C*(a+l) in excess of C*(a) is consistent with positive values of v(a).
The formula for changes in productivity with age is given in (10).

In

some cases one can read the age—productivity relationship from the slope of
the age—present expected compensation profile, C*(a), and knowledge that
pR<l.

For example, productivity is constant with age in the range of ages

over which the C*(a) profile is flat.

One can also tell that productivity

rises with age over ranges in which C*(a) is rising, but at a decreasing
rate; the intuition here is that a positive, but flattening slope of C*(s)
means that the immediate positive slope of C*(a) (the difference in C*(a+l)
and C*(a)) is due to v(a+l) exceeding v(a), rather than to later marginal
If C*(a) is increasing, but at an increasing rate,

products exceeding v(a).

one can not say whether productivity at age s+l exceeds or falls short of
productivity at age a.

Similarly, one can tell that productivity delines

with age over ranges of ages in which C*(a) declines with age at a
decreasing rate; however, if C*(a) declines with age at an increasing rate,
one can not tell whether productivity is decreasing or increasing with age.
Returning to the general case, ecuation (8) can be transformed into an
econometric relation by appending s multiplicative error term, eC5,t,j,

model means that workers hired at the same age in the same sex—occupation
category may have different initial salaries.

Hence, the model permits

workers hired at psrticular ages, or in certain years, may be more or less

While h(

) can,

in principle, be parameterized as a function of

service as well as age, in ptactice, the resulting cummulative age and
cummulative service vatiables are too colinear to estimate separate age and
service coefficients.

Hence,

I

parameterize the productivity function h(

as simply a cubic function of age, and acknowledge that the age—

Letting h(k,a) — a1k + c2k2 + a3k3, H(a) can be written as:

percent snd 9 percent compensation and productivity profiles of female

office workers in Figures 13 and 14.

Since the present value of these

profiles always equals $500,000, the profiles assuming a 9 percent interest
rate are initially higher than those assuming a 3 percent interest rate.
The percentage differences between the two profiles is slightly larger at
early and late ages, assuming a 9 percent, rather than a 3 percent interest
rate; but since the initial levels of the profiles

in Figure 14 are higher,

the absolute differences between compensation and productivity are
considerably larger.

The age at which productivity of female office workers

falls below compensation also depends on the interest rate.

An alternative way to explore this issue is to model h(

depending only on age, but to estimate the model separately for workers

hired at different ages.

If one estimates the model separately for those

hired prior to age 35 and those after age

35,

the resulting general shapes

of the productivity profiles are quite similar to those based on the entire
sample.

The post—age 35 profiles are indeed very similar, while the pro—age

35 profiles exhibit a steeper decline in productivity with age, with

negative predicted productivity after roughly age

55.

This prediction of

negative productIvity late in the work span may simply represent a poor fit
in the tail of the estimated polynomial.

Conclusions and Suggestions for Additional Research

The findings that productivity decreases with age must be viewed
cautiously.

Contrary to what has been assumed,

it may be that some workers

within a sex—occupation category receive different contracts than others.
A and B type workers
Suppose that within a sex—occupation categor' there are
and that A type workers receive contracts with steeper compensation profiles

than B type workers.

Also assume that A type workers have smaller values of

As a consequence, the age—productivity profile derived using the

method presented here could differ from either the profile for group A

Similar biases may ariae if the

These potential biases need to be explored more formally

as does the possible bias arising from assuming static expectations of
overall worker productivity.
These concerns notwithstanding,

correspondence

Interestingly, there is much closer

of productivity to compensation for amlasworkera, who are

compensated more on a spot market basis, than for other types of workers.
Also, the relationship of productivity to compenaation is weakest for male
managers,

who, one would expect, are most likely to be hired on a contract

rather than a spot market basis.
In addition to confirming contract theory, the results lend support to
the bonding wage models of Becker and Stigler (1974) and Lazear (1979,1981).

In contrast, the reaults contradict the predictions of the standard Mincer—
Becker human cmpital model in which workers receive more than they are worth
when young and less than they are worth when old.

They also are at odds

with the eaaertion of some efficiency wage models that workers receive their
marginal product on an annual basis.
