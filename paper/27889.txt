ABSTRACT
We survey more than 200 private equity (PE) managers from firms with $1.9 trillion of assets
under management (AUM) about their portfolio performance, decisionmaking and activities
during the Covid-19 pandemic. Given that PE managers have significant incentives to maximize
value, their actions during the current pandemic should indicate what they perceive as being
important for both the preservation and creation of value. PE managers believe that 40% of their
portfolio companies are moderately negatively affected and 10% are very negatively affected by
the pandemic. The private equity managers—both investment and operating partners— are
actively engaged in the operations, governance, and financing in all of their current portfolio
companies. These activities are more intensively pursued in those companies that have been more
severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result of the pandemic, they expect the
performance of their existing funds to decline. They are more pessimistic about that decline than
the VCs surveyed in Gompers et al. (2020b). Despite the pandemic, private equity managers are
seeking new investments. Relative to the 2012 survey results reported in Gompers, Kaplan, and
Mukharlyamov (2016): the PE investors place a greater weight on revenue growth for value
creation; they give a larger equity stake to management teams; and, they also appear to target
somewhat lower returns.

Introduction
Private equity (PE) investors are typically viewed as quintessential ideal shareholders.

They usually own a majority of the equity in the companies within their portfolio, take active roles
in governance and operations, and seek to maximize the value of their investments given that
private equity managers are typically compensated with a large share of the profits of the funds
(Gompers and Lerner (1999)). Jenson (1989) argues that private equity represented a superior
organizational form over dispersed public ownership. Research, including Kaplan (1989a,b),
Acharya et al (2013), Davis et al (2014), has consistently shown that PE firms increase the
productivity of their portfolio companies. PE returns also have consistently outperformed the
public markets both gross and net of fees (Brown and Kaplan (2019)). Our prior survey, Gompers,
Kaplan, and Mukharlyamov (2016) (GKM 2016), explored how private equity firms pursue
investment decision-making as well as operational, governance, and financial engineering.
Covid-19 has dramatically and unexpectedly shocked the global economy. In the short-run,
financial performance, including revenue and cash flows, have been significantly affected.
Additionally, uncertainty about the future of the pandemic potentially hinders the ability to make
new investment decisions. In response to this shock, we have undertaken a second survey of the
private equity industry to understand investors’ responses to this crisis. The new survey provides
insights about how highly motivated owners of companies are managing the economic
implications of the crisis. In particular, given that Covid-19 is an exogenous shock to economic
performance, we ask private equity manages to divide their portfolio into three categories of firms:
those affected positively or unaffected by the pandemic (green light), those moderately affected
by the pandemic (yellow light), and those severely affected by the pandemic (red light). By
comparing across green, yellow, and red light companies, we consider how important different
actions are for maintaining value across differential economic shocks to performance, particularly
underperforming firms. Second, by comparing the survey results to GKM 2016 (conducted from
2011 to 2013), we study how the industry has adapted over time and from more “normal” times.

2

We survey more than 200 private equity (PE) managers from firms with $1.9 trillion of
assets under management (AUM). We first establish that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a
meaningful impact on private equity firms by asking them to assess the health of their existing
portfolio companies. On average, 50.9% of private equity firm portfolio companies are unaffected
by the pandemic, 39.9% are somewhat affected, and 9.6% are severely affected. This
heterogeneity allows us to explore differential activity across those categories. In particular, we
look at how the actions that private equity firms are undertaking in various categories of distress
indicate their importance for helping underperforming companies. Consistent with the impact on
portfolio companies, we also find that the outlook for the performance of their existing private
equity portfolios (both internal rate of return and the multiple on invested capital) has been
significantly negatively affected. This will make outperformance of public markets, particularly
the S&P 500, difficult going forward.
This survey on the effects of Covid-19 follows a similar organizational structure to that
employed in GKM 2016. Kaplan and Strömberg (2009) classify three types of value increasing
actions—financial engineering, governance engineering, and operational engineering. These
value-increasing actions are not necessarily mutually exclusive. GKM 2016 identify and tabulate
the key decisions made by 79 private equity (PE) investors (with a total of over $750 billion of
private equity assets under management as of the end of 2012). That sample, like the current
sample, included private equity firms across a spectrum of investment strategies, size, industry
specialization, and geographic focus. The GKM 2016 survey asked PE managers questions about
financial engineering—how they value companies and think about portfolio company capital
structures; governance engineering—how they think about management incentives, governance
and monitoring; and operational engineering—how they think about value creation, both before
closing the transaction and after the transaction.
GKM 2016 find that all three forms of engineering are important. For financial engineering,
PE firms set the capital structure based upon both market timing, i.e., they look to use debt when
interest rates are low, as well as to provide incentives for management to maximize cash flows.
These results are consistent with academic theory and teaching. In choosing the capital structures
3

for their portfolio companies, PE investors appear to rely equally on factors that are consistent
with capital structure trade-off theories of Myers (1977) and those that are consistent with market
timing of Baker and Wurgler (2002).
In governance engineering, PE investors expect to provide strong equity incentives to their
management teams and believe those incentives are very important. They regularly replace top
management, both before and after they invest. And they structure smaller boards of directors with
a mix of insiders, PE investors and outsiders. These results are consistent with research on value
enhancing governance structures that have been identified in other settings.
Finally, GKM 2016 find that PE managers place a heavy emphasis on operational
engineering, i.e., adding value to their portfolio companies, both before and after they invest. The
sources of added value, in order of importance, were increasing revenue, improving incentives
and governance, facilitating a high-value exit or sale, making additional acquisitions, replacing
management, and reducing costs.
In this paper, we consider three main types of PE managers’ actions.First, we look at how
they are managing their portfolios and trying to mitigate the damage. In doing so, we look at
operational and governance engineering, both of which are meant to improve operations and
maximize cash flows of the business. And we look at financial engineering that is designed to
improve firms’ liquidity and ensure that portfolio companies have the financial resources that they
need to survive until the pandemic is over. Financial engineering in light of a reduction in current
operating cash flows may be necessary to ensure portfolio companies do not default on their debt
obligations.
For severely affected portfolio companies, we find, unsurprisingly, that the most common
activities for PE managers are reducing head count and reducing costs. These activities are much
less important for firms that are relatively unaffected. Similarly, replacing management is far more
likely in severely affected companies than in unaffected companies. On the other hand, providing
general operational and strategic guidance as well as recruiting new board members is similar
across all three categories of companies.
4

The most consistent financial engineering strategy that PE managers employ to improve
liquidity is drawing down the company revolving lines of credit (revolvers). The more severely
affected the portfolio company, the more likely the PE manager is to draw down the revolver.
Larger and older PE organizations exhibit a significantly higher propensity to draw down
revolvers. A second source of potential liquidity is equity investments. The vast majority of PE
managers who indicate a desire to raise equity in existing portfolio companies indicate that the
source of the equity would likely be the existing fund that had invested in the company, not a later
fund or a third-party fund. Smaller PE firms, which likely have smaller portfolio companies, also
are more likely to help their companies access the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Some PE
managers indicate a desire to refinance the debt and to extend maturities.
Second, we explore the impact of the pandemic on investment decision-making. In the
current crisis, private equity managers still spend a significant portion of their time sourcing and
evaluating new investments. Among the criteria that PE managers use to evaluate new investment
opportunities, business model ranked as the most important followed closely by the management
team. This is similar to the results in GKM 2016. When asked where they expect value creation
to come from, the PE investors overwhelmingly pointed to growth in revenue as the key driver
with reduction in costs a distant second. The focus on increased revenue versus cost reduction is
greater than that reported in GKM 2016. In addition, the PE investors indicate they are giving a
larger equity stake to management teams than in the previous survey. Finally, they also appear to
target somewhat lower returns. For new investments, the PE managers target IRRs averaging
22.6%, but that target is lower than the 27.0% reported in GKM 2016.
Among industries, information technology (IT) and health care are the two most attractive
industry. This is not surprising given the public market performance of these sectors. These
preferences also are consistent with Gompers, Gornall, Kaplan, and Strebulaev (2020b) who find
that venture capital portfolio companies (which are heavily weighted in the IT and health care
industries) have been relatively unaffected by the pandemic. North America and Western Europe
remain the most attractive geographies (despite how severe the pandemic was in those
geographies) while LBOs and growth equity remain the most attractive types of investments.
5

Third, our survey asks about the internal operations of the PE firms. We seek to understand
whether time allocation of investment and operating partners has changed given the external shock
of Covid-19. We find that both investment and operating partners are spending the bulk of their
time helping existing portfolio companies. At the same time, investment partners are still spending
17.7 hours per week finding and evaluating new deals. In total, investment partners are working
nearly 60 hours per week while operating partners are working in excess of 50 hours per week.
Investment partners also are meeting with limited partners 3.6 hours per week. Roughly 21% of
limited partners have expressed a desire for reduced capital calls.
Finally, despite the pandemic, PE managers are optimistic about both their own
performance and that of the PE industry overall. 76.8% of managers believe that the fund they
currently manage will outperform the public markets either somewhat or substantially. 35.3% of
PE investors believe that the overall PE industry will perform slightly better than the public
markets while 53.1% predict that the entire PE industry will perform somewhat or much better
than the public markets.
The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we describe our research design and report
summary statistics. In Section 3, we report our results. In Section 4, we conclude.

Research and Survey Design

2.1. Design
We created the survey to determine how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected PE investors.
We also designed the survey with the intent of comparing answers to our prior survey from 2011
to 2013, primarily in 2012, in GKM 2016. We initially tested the survey on a small number of PE
investors in the May 2020. We revised the survey to reflect some ambiguities in our questions and
to add some additional questions. The final survey includes 54 questions and is available on Paul
Gompers’s website.

6

2.2. Delivery and Response
We distributed the survey to PE investors during July and early August 2020. We
distributed it to the alumni of Chicago Booth and HBS employed in PE and to investors where one
of the co-authors knew or was introduced to a senior investment professional. We received our
last survey response in early August 2020. The vast majority of survey responses, therefore, were
received in July 2020.
We invited a total of 1,180 investment professionals to participate in the survey by filling
out an online questionnaire. Of these, 272 filled out some part of the survey; the median respondent
answered 96% of questions shown to them.2 The response rate of roughly 23% is much higher
than the response rate for other surveys. Graham and Harvey (2001) obtain a response rate of 8.9%
for CFOs while Da Rin and Phalippou (2014) obtain a response rate of 13.8% for PE limited
partners.3
The 272 individual responses correspond to 214 PE firms. For PE firms with two or more
respondents, we obtain a firm-level response by averaging out the responses of the individual
investors.
We also study the within-firm variation in responses obtained from multiple people and
establish notable agreement between them.4 This is consistent with the survey's efficacy in

2

From the participant’s perspective, the survey is path-dependent. For example, respondents with no portfolio companies severely
affected by the Covid-19 pandemic were not asked about the value-add activities they pursue in such companies. For that reason,
the number of survey questions varies by person.
3
Since participants were allowed to skip questions, for a subset of questions, especially toward the end of the survey, the effective
response rate is commensurate with that of Da Rin and Phalippou (2014).
4
First, we calculated the average pairwise Euclidean distance between vectors of Z-scores representing survey responses from
different people at the same PE firm. Second, to establish the benchmark, we randomly perturbed survey responses to create 1,000
datasets with observations within the same PE firm matched by chance alone. Based on the distribution of 1,000 pseudo distances
computed from the step 2 datasets, the actual distance measured in step 1 is 2.8 standard deviations below the lower bound of that
distribution.
7

eliciting meaningful information. In addition, among participants who handled the survey in one
sitting, the median respondent dedicated 15-16 minutes to the questionnaire. Taking into account
how senior the sample participants are in their PE firms' hierarchy (Panel C of Table 1), they have
clearly taken the survey seriously.

2.3. Private Equity Firm Characteristics
Table 1 provides some summary statistics for the firms of the PE investors who responded
to the survey. We obtained cumulative AUM in PE5, dry powder available, number of past PE
deals, number of employees, and geographic distribution of offices from Preqin. Information on
firms not covered by Preqin is taken from firm websites and media articles.
The table shows that there is a large variation in the size of the firms as measured by assets
under management (AUM). The mean AUM is just under $10.7 billion. A quarter of the firms
have AUM under $400.0 million while a quarter have AUM above $8.0 billion. Table 2 looks at
average equity check size that our PE respondents are investing. On average (median) our firms
invest $140.2 ($50.0) million. Larger and older PE firms write larger checks ($194.8 and $231.2
million) than do smaller and younger PE firms ($85.6 and $58.8 million).
Overall, PE managers at 214 different firms with total AUM of roughly $1.9 trillion filled
out the survey. Because the participants were allowed to skip questions, the amount of AUM
represented by the survey data differs by question. But even the question with the fewest responses
among questions available to all—the last question in the survey—still covers 126 PE firms with
AUM of $1.3 trillion. Clearly, we have solid coverage of the largest PE firms. Each year, Private
Equity International (PEI) Media ranks the top PE firms globally by AUM. Our sample includes

5

This measures cumulative AUM for the PE firm, not the size of the most recent fund.
8

twelve of the top twenty-five in PEI’s 2019 list; among these, nine followed through till the last
question. Given this, we believe that our results are reflective of a meaningful fraction of the PE
industry.

Results

3.1. Covid-19 Effects on Private Equity Industry
We first examine the PE investors’ overall assessments of implications of the Covid-19
pandemic. We explore these assessments at both the individual portfolio company level as well as
the aggregate fund return level. We asked PE managers to assess the relative fraction of their
portfolio that is unaffected or positively affected by the pandemic (green light), somewhat affected
(yellow light), and severely affected (red light) by the Covid-19 pandemic. Because most of the
companies were likely similarly situated before the exogenous effects of the pandemic, comparing
across these three categories allows us to highlight actions PE managers take at various stages of
distress. Table 3 shows that PE investors believe that 50.9% of their portfolios is unaffected by
the pandemic, 39.9% of the portfolio is somewhat affected, and 9.6% is severely affected.
We next ask how the PE managers expect the current Covid-19 pandemic to impact fund
performance. Like GKM 2016, we ask whether their funds target an Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
and/or a Multiple on Invested Capital (MOIC). Slightly more PE managers target an MOIC
(81.8%) than IRR (60.4%) in Table 4. Given that these add up to more than 100%, it is clear that
many managers target both MOIC and IRR.
Because roughly 50% of the PE portfolios have been adversely affected by the pandemic, we
asked the PE investors how they thought the pandemic would affect the IRRs and MOICs on their
existing funds. Table 5 shows that 85.4% of PE investors expect their fund’s IRR to be adversely
affected and 58.8% of respondents expected their existing fund’s MOICs to be adversely affected.
9

The average (median) change in expected IRR is -4.4% (-4.9%) while the average (median)
expected change in MOIC is -0.24 (-0.20).
These represent a substantial effect relative to the typical target IRR and MOIC. When we
compare these results to those of a similar and contemporaneous survey of venture capital industry
(Gompers, Gornall, Kaplan, and Strebulaev (2020b)), we find that the PE industry is substantially
more affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. In the venture capital (VC) survey, although a similar
percentage of the portfolio was negatively affected (10%), the VCs expected declines in IRR
(MOIC) of only 1.6% (0.07).
The declines in PE IRRs and MOICs also appear substantial compared to the return on the S&P
500 through the end of July 2020. At that time, the S&P 500 had a positive year-to-date total return
in 2020 of 2.5%, driven, in particular, by the success of the large technology companies. That
performance is likely to make comparisons of PE returns to the S&P 500 very challenging for
existing vintages. The comparisons will be less challenging with the less technology heavy Russell
2000 which had a year-to-date total return of -10.4% at the end of July 2020.

3.2. Existing Portfolio Implications
GKM 2016 examines a variety of actions that PE firms perform to add value to their portfolio
companies. In that survey, PE investors place a heavy emphasis on adding value through
operational and governance engineering. PE investors indicated that they place a heavy emphasis
on adding value to their portfolio companies, both before and after they invest. The sources of that
added value, in order of importance, were increasing revenue, improving incentives and
governance, facilitating a high-value exit or sale, making additional acquisitions, replacing
management, and reducing costs. Consistent with adding operational value, the PE managers make

10

meaningful investments in employees and advisors who provide advice and help in implementing
operating improvements. Additionally, PE managers put a strong emphasis on implementing high
powered equity incentives to their management teams and thought those incentives are very
important. They also focused on creating smaller board of directors with a mix of insiders, PE
investors, and outsiders.
In the earlier survey, PE investors also placed importance on financial engineering, i.e.,
putting in place the type of capital structure that could potentially enhance value. PE investors
appeared to rely equally on factors that are consistent with capital structure trade-off theories and
those consistent with market timing. The results were different from those for the CFOs in Graham
and Harvey (2001). The market timing result was consistent with the results in Axelson,
Jenkinson, Strömberg, and Weisbach (2013).

3.2.1. Operational and Governance Engineering
Our next set of questions involves examining how PE investors are managing their existing
portfolio companies through operational and governance engineering. The first question asks who
works with portfolio companies. Table 6 reports that 84.4% of existing portfolio companies have
involvement of deal team members, 57.6% have operating partners involved in their management,
and 23.0% have outside consultants actively engaged.
Table 7 presents the results concerning how often the PE manager has interacted during
the pandemic with the typical portfolio company. The intensity of interaction has been very high.
81.7% interact with the typical portfolio company at least weekly. 50.7% interact multiple times
per week while 6.8% were interacting daily. This is substantially higher than the rate of portfolio
company interaction in Gompers, Gornall, Kaplan, and Strebulaev (2020b) for VCs. VCs meet

11

with 26% of the portfolio once a week, 26% multiple times per week, and 2% daily. In the current
crisis, PE managers appear to be more hands on than VCs.
Based on the classification from Table 3, we asked PE managers the types of activities they
engaged in within their existing portfolio companies. Panels A and B of Table 8 present the percent
of portfolio companies in the green, yellow, and red categories in which they are performing
specific operational or governance engineering activities.
The prevalence of different actions, in general, is monotonically higher going from green
to yellow to red portfolio companies. For example, reducing head count is an activity in only
28.5% of unaffected portfolio companies, while it rises to 65.7% in moderately affected
companies, and to 87.1% in severely affected companies. Similarly, reducing other costs occurs
in 47.8% of the green companies, 78.2% of yellow companies, and 91.0% of red companies.
In all three categories (green/yellow/red) of portfolio companies, PE managers are active
in

providing

general

operational

(64.3%/77.5%/82.4%)

and

strategic

guidance

(79.7%/88.6%/89.8%). This is consistent with GKM 2016 in which PE managers take active roles
in providing support.
The PE managers in our survey are also actively involved in governance engineering and
their involvement increases as firms become more severely affected.

For example, in all

categories of companies (5.8%/12.2%/19.2%), PE managers actively seek to replace the CEO or
CFO. The percentage of PE managers involved in other senior management replacement is
similarly high (7.6%/13.4%/25.4%). Hiring other managers and recruiting board members is also
an important activity, but is not related to being more severely affected by Covid-19. Overall, the
more operationally affected a portfolio company is, the more likely the PE managers are to be
deeply involved.

12

3.2.2. Financial Engineering
GKM 2016 also examine financial engineering by PE managers. Kaplan (1989b) showed
that taxes are one source of value in leveraged buyouts. Jensen (1989) argued that leverage
imposed financial and operating discipline on company executives and avoided agency costs of
free cash flow. As discussed earlier, Covid-19 has been an unexpected shock to many firms’
revenue and cash flows. As such, maintaining liquidity and avoiding default is potentially a critical
concern for PE investors. To gauge how important liquidity concerns are, we asked PE managers
what fraction of their portfolio companies currently had covenant violations. On average, 22.7%
of portfolio companies had a covenant violation. There is no significant difference in the rate of
covenant violation in small vs. large or old vs. young PE firms.
We asked PE managers about the target capital structure policies for their existing portfolio
companies. Table 9 tabulates their answers for bank and long-term debt maturity, debt-to-capital
ratio, and debt-to-EBITDA. Average (median) target maturity of bank and other long-term debt
are 4.2 (4.0) years and 5.0 (5.0) years. Large PE firms have longer target maturities (4.6 years
bank debt / 5.2 years other long-term debt) than small PE firms (3.9 years bank debt / 4.8 years
other long-term debt). Target debt-to-capital is 44.6% on average (50.0% median) and is
significantly higher for larger (47.4%) PE firms when compared to smaller (41.8%) ones. Debtto-EBITDA ratios average 3.8 (median 3.6) in our sample and are significantly higher for large
(4.6) and old (4.2) when compared to small (3.0) and young (3.4) PE firms.
We also asked PE managers in what fraction of their portfolio companies they sought to
refinance their debt. Panel A of Table 10 shows that our PE managers target debt refinancing in
30.5% of their portfolio companies. When we asked the managers to rate the reason for seeking

13

to refinance (Panel B of Table 10), extending the maturity of the debt rated the highest at 6.1 (on
a scale from 1 to 10) followed by the low current rates at 5.2 and (potential) covenant violations
being next at 5.1. Larger PE firms rated extending the maturity of the debt (6.6) significantly
higher than smaller firms (5.5).
Table 11 compares the target debt policies of our firms during Covid-19 with our earlier
survey. Except for debt to EBITDA, all the financial policies of our PE mangers have changed.
Debt maturity for both bank and other long-term debt has fallen significantly, falling from 5.25
years to 4.23 years for bank debt and from 6.89 years to 5.01 years for other long-term debt. Target
debt-to-capital ratios have also fallen significantly. They were 55.74% in the earlier survey and
are 44.6% now. These changes are consistent with an increased riskiness of the portfolio
companies and a desire to finance their companies more conservatively.
Panel C of Table 8 tabulates the prevalence of financial engineering activities undertaken
by PE managers depending upon the severity of Covid-19 on their portfolio companies. Across a
number of areas, PE managers are active in raising cash for their companies. The intensity of these
activities is greater the more severely Covid-19 has affected the portfolio company. Across the
different

categories

of

portfolio

companies

(green/yellow/red),

a

large

fraction

(40.0%/55.4%/71.0%) are actively drawing down their revolving credit facilities. Similarly,
helping their portfolio companies access the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is a common
activity for the PE managers (17.1%/25.1%/32.3%).
Drawing down revolvers and accessing the PPP program are both non-dilutive (from an
equity perspective) ways to raise cash for portfolio companies. We also asked whether PE
managers if they were pursuing equity infusions for their portfolio companies. Except for the most
severely affected companies, raising new equity has been a relatively infrequent activity for PE

14

managers. In 34.5% of the severely affected (red) companies, however, PE managers actively
sought to raise equity.
We also asked whether the PE firm sought to raise the equity from third parties, the same
fund that had invested in the portfolio company, or a later fund. By far the most common potential
source of equity is the same fund that had invested in the company. In 35.7% of the severely
affected companies, PE managers were pursuing equity investments from the same fund. Third
parties represent the second most frequent target source of equity financing – in 12.7% of severely
affected portfolio companies. Later funds by the same manager are almost never mentioned as a
source of equity financing for portfolio companies. Even in severely affected companies, only
2.5% of the time did PE managers consider an equity investment from a later fund. This is
consistent with the conflict of interest perceived by limited partners in cross-fund investing.
We find significant differences when we compare different types of PE firms. For example,
across all portfolio company categories (green/yellow/red), small PE firms are far more likely to
help their companies participate in the PPP program. This is perhaps not surprising because much
of the PPP program was targeted at smaller businesses and smaller PE firms hold smaller
companies in their portfolio. Older and larger PE firms are more likely to be helping their portfolio
companies draw down their revolvers across each category of portfolio companies
(green/yellow/red). For equity investments, there is no consistent pattern of activity across fund
size or age.
Overall, we find that PE firms are active in seeking additional cash for their portfolio
companies. Non-dilutive financing (either bank revolvers or the PPP program), unsurprisingly, is
preferable to outside equity. Outside equity appears to be an option in only the most severely
affected companies.

15

3.3. Exit Implications
Exiting investments is a critical element of the PE process. We asked a set of questions
concerning whether and how exits might be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Given the turmoil
in operations identified above, one might expect that exits are not top of mind for PE firms. In
Panel A of Table 12, we ask PE managers whether their investment horizon has decreased, stayed
the same, or increased in the current environment. Fewer than 1% answered that their investment
horizon has decreased; 72.2% of respondents indicated that their investment horizon has increased.
At the same time, in Panel A of Table 13, we find that PE managers have not given up on exiting.
More than 55% of PE managers still seek to exit existing portfolio companies.
Finally, we asked about the attractiveness of different types of exits in current financial
markets. Strategic sales are rated most highly by PE managers in Panel B of Table 13, averaging
7.2 on a scale from 1 to 10. Sales to financial buyers is the next most highly rated exit path,
receiving 6.3 on average. Pursuing an IPO is rated significantly higher by larger (4.6) and older
(4.3) PE organizations than by smaller (2.3) and young (2.7) firms did, likely reflecting the fact
that smaller portfolio companies do not have the option to go public.
Overall, then, despite the current impact of Covid-19, PE managers are still seeking to gain
liquidity in their portfolios.

3.4. Investment Decision-Making Implications
To this point, our analysis has largely focused on how PE managers engage with their existing
portfolio companies. In this section, we examine how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected
decision-making on future investments.

16

GKM 2016 identify deal sourcing and deal selection as important elements of the PE
investment process. We find in Table 14 that virtually all PE firms (94.6%) in our sample are still
seeking new investments. At the same time, 14.6% of our respondents indicated that they
anticipate that they will walk away from signed deals. While these may seem at odds with each
other, clearly the terms agreed to prior to the onset of the pandemic may be unattractive after.
We asked the PE investors what IRR or MOIC they targeted for new investments in the firm’s
main fund. In Table 15 we find that for PE firms that target IRR, the average (median) target IRR
is 22.6% (24.8%). We do not find any difference between small and large or old and young PE
firms. For those who target MOIC, the average (median) MOIC target is 2.7 (2.6). PE firms with
offices exclusively in the US have an MOIC target (2.8) that is significantly higher than that of
other firms (2.5).
In Table 16, we compare the average IRR and MOIC targets in the current survey to those of
our earlier survey. Both IRR and MOIC targets have declined, with the decline in IRR target
significant. In GKM 2016, the average PE firm had an IRR target of 27.0% compared to our
current survey target of 22.6%.
This reduction in target IRR may reflect the tremendous growth in the PE industry over the
past eight years. Global AUM in PE (buyout and growth equity) in 2019 was $3.8 trillion billion
versus $1.3 trillion in 2012 according to Preqin. This growth has potentially led to increased
purchase multiples for PE investors as well as firms commensurately lowering their
target/projected IRRs and MOICs. The decline in target IRR may also reflect, at least partially,
the decline in long-term interest rates over this period. These explanations are not mutually
exclusive.

17

The investment horizon of new investments (in Panel B of Table 12) has remained similar to
that in GKM 2016 with an average (median) of 5.2 years (5.0 years).
We next asked PE managers what factors they considered most important when deciding
whether to invest. In Table 17, we see that business model is the most important investment factor
with an average rating of 8.5 followed by management team (8.0), ability to be cash flow positive
(7.7), and ability to add value (7.7). These patterns are similar to those in GKM 2016 where the
PE investors also rated the business model as the most important factor followed by the
management team. The result that business model is more important than management team for
PE investors differs from the result in Gompers et al. (2020a) that the management team is more
important for VC investors.
Table 18 examines the source of return generation for new deals that PE firms expect in the
current Covid-19 environment. We asked PE managers to rate each potential source of value on a
scale from 1 to 10. The PE investors overwhelmingly point to growth in revenue as the key driver
with an average of 8.2. Reduction in costs is a distant second at 5.4. The focus on increased
revenue versus cost reduction is greater than that reported in GKM 2016. This result also indicates
that despite the current economic downturn, PE firms remained focused more on increasing
revenue than on cutting costs.
This finding is not at all consistent with the frequent criticism that PE firms largely seek to
cut employment and costs in their portfolio companies. Instead, this result and the similar result
in GKM 2016 indicate that growing the business is the most important strategy to increase value
independent of the phase of the economic cycle.
We next asked a series of questions about the types of investments that are most attractive. In
Panel A of Table 19 we ask what types of investment strategies are attractive; in Panel B we ask

18

what industries are attractive; and in Panel C we ask which regions are most attractive, all on a
scale from 1 to 10. LBOs, growth equity, and follow-on investments are rated similarly at 6.1;
with larger PE firms having a higher proclivity toward LBOs (6.5) compared to smaller firms (5.7)
but no statistically significant difference across firm size and age otherwise. Not surprisingly,
larger and older firms rated Private Investments in Public Equities (PIPEs) more highly (4.3 and
4.3) than did smaller and younger firms (3.0 and 3.1).
Consistent with the results of Gompers et al. (2020b) for VC deals, PE firms rate IT and
Healthcare as the most attractive investment industries at 6.2 and 6.9. Energy, materials, and
utilities all rate low, from 2.0 to 2.5. These are also the two sectors in the public market that have
done well in the current Covid-19 environment. The S&P 500 Healthcare Index is up 2.35% for
the year and the S&P 500 Information Technology Index is up 23.14% for the year.
Interestingly, when we asked which regions are most attractive for PE investments, despite
being among the more affected by the Covid-19 pandemic for the longest duration, North America
is the most highly rated region at 6.6. Western Europe is next at 3.7. All the other regions are
below 2.3. This ranking of regions may reflect the concentration of PE in North America as well
as our survey being more highly skewed to managers in North America.
Finally, we asked what fraction of considered investments would end up in an actual
investment. We find that 10.9% of considered opportunities are anticipated to end up as an actual
investment (Panel B of Table 14). This is substantially higher than the 3.9% that GKM 2016
report. We find it difficult to reconcile these two numbers. Perhaps, the hurdle to be a considered
deal is higher and therefore, fewer, higher quality deals are in the pipeline. Second, perhaps the
pipeline has become dramatically narrower during Covid-19 and the “denominator” of considered
deals has shrunk.

19

When making investments, PE investors choose among various securities. We asked in what
fraction of deals the PE managers use various securities and tabulate the results in Table 20. PE
managers say they will use common stock in roughly 60% of their deals. This compares to almost
75% of deals in GKM 2016. In the current environment, PE investors appear to have moved PE
investments more towards senior securities. PE managers stated that they used preferred stock in
almost 43% of their investments, convertible preferred in 23%, and convertible debt in 13%. Small
PE firms were more likely to use senior securities than were large PE firms.
Another critical element of investment decision-making is how much equity to provide to the
management team to incentivize them. We asked PE managers how much of the equity is owned
by various parties. Table 21 shows that 72.9% of a company’s equity is, on average, owned by the
PE sponsor. Table 22 compares the results from our earlier survey to our current sample. PE
sponsors’ ownership has declined from 79.6% on average to 74.9%. CEO ownership has increased
to 10.9% from 8.0% while ownership of the top 10 managers and other employees has increased
to 11.3% from 8.9%. This suggests that management teams have become a more valuable and
scarcer resource over time.
As was true in GKM 2016, large firms and old PE firms typically take more ownership (80.2%
and 75.4%) than small and young firms (65.6% and 70.7%). This is likely the case because older
and larger PE firms fund larger deals, leaving the management teams with an equity interest of
similar (or larger) dollar value.
Overall, PE firms continue to seek out new investments. The firm’s business model and then
the firm’s management team rank as the first and second most important investment criteria. PE
investors are seeking to invest in more senior securities and are giving a larger equity stake to
management.

20

3.5. Internal PE Firm Implications
The next set of questions examines how PE firms’ internal operations have been affected by
the Covid-19 pandemic. We first asked PE managers to detail how investing and operating partners
are spending their time during the crisis. Panel A of Table 23 shows the hours per week investing
partners spend on various activities. The majority of their time is being spent assisting portfolio
companies, 25.2 hours per week.
Consistent with our results above on investment-decision making and that PE firms are
exploring new investment opportunities, investing partners are spending time identifying new,
potential deals, 17.7 hours per week on average. They also are spending 6.1 hours per week on
networking for a total of 23.8 hours per week that is related to new deals. Managing the firm
accounts for 6.4 hours per week and meeting with limited partners totals 3.6 hours per week.
Across firm types, PE investors at smaller and younger firms spend more time on managing
their firms (7.6 and 8.2 hours per week) relative to investing partners at larger and older firms (5.1
and 4.3 hours). This makes sense if there are more partners in older and larger firms and if they
are more likely to have dedicated staff who manage the firm’s internal operations. In total,
investment partners report they are working an average of 59.3 hours per week, suggesting that
the PE investors are highly engaged through the pandemic.
We next asked firms that have operating partners, how the operating partners are spending
their time on various activities. Panel B of Table 23 finds that the vast majority of their time is
spent assisting portfolio companies, 33.5 hours per week, substantially more than investing
partners. The next most time-consuming category is finding and evaluating potential deals at 6.5
hours per week, significantly less than the time spent by investing partners. All the other categories

21

take relatively modest portions of operating partners’ time. On average operating partners are
reported to work 50.4 hours per week, again suggesting they are highly engaged.
Given the experience during the financial crisis in which liquidity concerns caused LPs to want
reduced or no capital calls, we asked PE managers whether or not they have received similar
requests from LPs during the Covid-19 crisis. Table 24 shows that 21% of PE managers indicated
that their LPs have communicated a desire for reduced capital calls. Young PE firms have limited
partners who are more likely to indicate a desire for reduced capital calls (25.6%) relative to older
firms (15.3%). Although the difference is not statistically significant, this may reflect a difference
in the LP base of young funds who typically rely on smaller institutions and high net worth
individuals for their funding.
Finally, we asked PE managers if they are currently fundraising. Table 25 shows that 38.1%
of PE firms have been fundraising in the Covid-19 environment. Given the lifecycle of funds, this
figure appears to be overall in line with the proclivity of firms to fundraise during normal times
suggesting that the pandemic has had at most a modest effect on the fundraising efforts of firms.
Having said that, larger firms are more than twice as likely to be fundraising as smaller firms
(53.2% versus 22.9%). This could be a manifestation of larger firms having a wider spectrum of
contemporaneous funds under management. Alternatively, but not in a mutually exclusive sense,
larger firms and their LPs might have been more pandemic-resilient as far as fundraising is
concerned. The former explanation appears more plausible because the fraction of PE firms that
anticipate their next fund to be larger than their current fund is the same (58%) for large and small
managers.6 The overall fundraising findings are consistent with Gompers, Gornall, Kaplan, and

6
35% of firms anticipate the next fund to be about the same size as the current fund; 7% expect a reduction in the fund size. 65%
of US-headquartered firms expect an increase, while this value (40%) is significantly lower for overseas managers.

22

Strebulaev (2020b) who find that venture capitalists have likewise continued to fundraise in the
Covid-19 environment.

3.6. Return Expectations
Our final questions looked at PE managers’ perceptions of their own and the entire PE
industry’s performance over the next ten years. In Panel A of Table 26, we find they are quite
optimistic about their own performance. 34.9% believe they will perform much better than public
markets while another 41.9% believe they will perform somewhat better. Only 1.7% think they
will perform slightly worse than the public markets.
When we asked the same managers their expectations for the entire industry, they were
similarly, albeit slightly less, optimistic. Panel B of Table 26 shows that 41.8% of PE managers
believe the industry will perform somewhat better than public markets over the next ten years
while 11.3% believe it will perform much better. Large PE firms are more pessimistic about the
industry than small PE firms. 16.1% of large managers believe that the PE industry will perform
either worse than or on par with the public markets with the corresponding number being 6.9%
for small firms.

Conclusion
We have reported the results of a survey of more than 200 private equity (PE) managers from

firms with $1.9 trillion of AUM about their portfolio performance, decision-making, and activities
during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Given that PE managers have significant incentives to maximize value, their actions during
the current pandemic should indicate what they perceive as being important for both the
preservation and creation of value. PE managers believe that 40% of their portfolio companies are
moderately negatively affected and 10% are very negatively affected by the pandemic. The private
23

equity managers—both investing and operating partners—are actively engaged in the operations,
governance, and financing in all of their current portfolio companies. These activities are more
intensively pursued in those companies that have been more severely affected by the Covid-19
pandemic. They include helping to reduce headcount and non-headcount costs, providing strategic
and operational guidance, and helping to insure liquidity by drawing down revolvers, using the
PPP and raising equity. Less frequently, they change out senior management.
As a result of the pandemic, the PE investors expect the performance of their existing funds to
decline. They are more pessimistic about that decline than the VCs surveyed in Gompers et al.
(2020b). Given the positive performance of the public market, particularly the tech-driven S&P
500 over this period, this is likely to make comparisons with the public markets difficult for the
private equity funds.
Despite the pandemic, private equity managers are seeking new investments. Relative to the
2012 survey results reported in Gompers, Kaplan, and Mukharlyamov (2016): the PE investors
place a greater weight on revenue growth for value creation; they are giving a larger equity stake
to management teams; and, they also appear to target somewhat lower returns. These changes are
consistent with the large increase in commitments to PE since 2012 increasing the competition
(and cost) of management teams as well as leading to a modest decline in the returns targeted by
PE investors.
