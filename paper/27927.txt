Capital Flows in Risky Times: Risk-on/Risk-off and Emerging Market Tail Risk
Anusha Chari, Karlye Dilts Stedman, and Christian Lundblad
NBER Working Paper No. 27927
October 2020
JEL No. F21,F3,G15
ABSTRACT
This paper characterizes the implications of risk-on/risk-off shocks for emerging market capital
flows and returns. We document that these shocks have important implications not only for the
median of emerging markets flows and returns but also for the left tail. Further, while there are
some differences in the effects across bond vs. equity markets and flows vs. asset returns, the
effects associated with the worst realizations are generally larger than that on the median
realization. We apply our methodology to the COVID-19 shock to examine the pattern of flow
and return realizations: the sizable risk-off nature of this shock engenders reactions that reside
deep in the left tail of most relevant emerging market quantities.

Introduction

While portfolio flows to emerging markets offer well-documented benefits (Bekaert, Harvey
and Lundblad (2005); Chari and Henry (2004, 2008); Henry (2007)), tail events such as sudden stops present challenges that prove particularly pressing for investors and policy makers
(Forbes and Warnock (2012, 2019); Rey (2013); Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2020)). There is,
of course, a large literature on cross-border capital flows and their implications for financial
market returns.1 However, extant research has largely focused on the first moment of the relevant distributions of these important quantities. In sharp contrast, building on Gelos et al.
(2019), we focus on the full distributions of emerging market capital flows and returns; most
important, we characterize the manner in which extreme capital flow and returns realizations
are tied to global risk appetite (“risk-on/risk-off” or RORO).
Despite still being somewhat imprecisely defined, the RORO terminology has come into
pervasive use in the financial press and among policy makers in the years since the global financial crisis. In this paper, we focus on RORO shocks as a reflection of variation in global
investor risk aversion. As investors rebalance their portfolios away from risk assets and toward safe assets in the face of risk aversion shock, RORO variation has important implications for asset price determination, particularly for so-called “risk assets”. Jotikasthira, Lundblad, and Ramadorai (2012), for example, document this shock transmission mechanism to
emerging market capital flows and asset prices. In response to funding shocks from their investor base (possibly linked to RORO), global funds substantially alter their portfolio alloca1 See for example a non-exhaustive list of papers in Section 1 of the online appendix, Alfaro, L., S.

tions to emerging markets with important implications for local asset prices.
To capture realized variation in global investor risk appetite, we consider two complementary approaches to RORO measurement. The first is a RORO index that we build using
the first principle component of daily data from both the United States and the Euro area.
This approach has the advantage of incorporating a multi-faceted set of signals from relevant
asset markets, but it may confound information about variation in risk appetite with variation in physical risk. To address this, we consider a complementary model-based approach
from Bekaert at al. (2020). This has the advantage of measuring risk aversion using a structural model specifically designed to separate the price of risk (or risk aversion) from the quantity of risk. However, inference about this separation may, of course, be contaminated by any
model mis-specfication. Given these competing concerns, we consider both approaches to
gauge the extent to which we can draw relatively robust conclusions regarding the effect of
RORO shocks on emerging market flows and returns.
Using our first (largely statistical) approach, we summarize the risk-on and risk-off states
of the world with an amalgam of four broad categories that reflect variation in advanced
economy credit risk, equity market volatility, funding conditions, and currencies and gold.
With an eye to inferring the risk bearing capacity of international investors, our RORO index comprises the first principle component of daily changes in these series. Our index, along
with several associated sub-indices reflecting these four constituent groups, exhibits interesting distributional features in the sense that it is well characterized by significant skewness
and fat tails. With fat tails, extreme events become both more probable and potentially more
destabilizing. As examples, we observe sharp risk-off movements during the global financial
crisis, the European debt crisis, the taper tantrum, and the COVID-19 crisis.
Second, in recognition of the fact that our RORO measure reflects a largely statistical approach to measuring risk appetite, we also consider the measure of risk aversion from Bekaert
at al. (2020). As with our first RORO index, this model-based measure is also highly rightskewed and fat tailed, spiking during the global financial and COVID-19 crises.
Understanding the implications of variation in RORO for emerging market capital flow
and return distributions is the focus of our paper. We focus on the extent to which RORO
shocks alter the range of the distribution versus shift the distribution. As an example, an ad3

verse, risk-off shock can make the whole emerging market capital flow or return distribution
wider by pulling out both of the tails. Alternatively, a risk-off shock could simply fatten the
left tail. These differences have important implications for how investors and policy makers
should consider downside risk.
Using a panel quantile regression approach as in Machado and Santos Silva (2019), we
characterize the distributional implications of RORO shocks for emerging market capital
flows and returns. In order to obtain a multilateral, high frequency proxy of capital flows
into and out of emerging markets, we use the country flows dataset from EPFR Global. EPFR
Global publishes weekly portfolio investment flows by more than 14,000 equity funds and
more than 7,000 bond funds, collectively with more than 8 trillion U.S. dollars of capital under management. To measure returns on emerging market assets, we use country level USD
and local currency equity return indices from MSCI, and our fixed income returns come from
Bloomberg local currency bond indices and the USD Emerging Market Bond Index from JP
Morgan. Due to the availability of EPFR data, the sample runs from January 7, 2004 to Apr. 9,
2020.
The novel contribution of our paper is to characterize the impact of shifts in the distributions of global risk on flows and returns as well as the dispersion in outcomes. In other
words, our methodology allows us to model both shifts and changes in the shapes of the distributions of global push factors and capital flow and return outcomes. We conclude that with
a few exceptions, the emphasis on measures of central tendency in the existing literature on
capital flows masks important underlying heterogeneity in the full distribution of global risk.
The weight placed on means and variances as sufficient summary statistics precludes the data
from speaking to the underlying distributional granularity of global risk – a challenge we
overcome by turning to heterogeneous effects across quantiles.2
In addition to our focus on the distribution of global risk, our composite risk measure
illustrates that the underlying factors that constitute global risk can differ across crises and
evolve over time. We find that while advanced economy equity returns and volatility along
with corporate spreads proxying for credit risk were the most significant risk factors during

across quantiles.

the global financial crisis, movement in corporate spreads and stoppages in funding liquidity
predominantly explain capital flows and returns in the aftermath of Covid-19 shock. The corporate spreads factor during the Covid-era are an order of magnitude compared to the global
financial crisis. The risk-aversion factor was more prominent in the global financial crisis relative to the quantity of risk, while the opposite prevails during the Covid crisis.
Regardless of the method by which we measure RORO, we find that RORO shocks do
have important implications, not only for the median of emerging market flows and returns,
but also for the tails. We conclude that the focus in the literature on measures of central tendency is incomplete. In particular, we find that the effects associated with the worst realizations, say the fifth quantile, are often more heavily affected by risk-off shocks, compared to
the median realization.
We first consider the distributional implications for cross-border flows associated with
EPFR bond and equity mutual funds. For bond funds, risk-off shocks (however measured)
increase the worst portfolio outflow realizations more than they decrease median flows, and
therefore risk-off shocks significantly fatten the left tail of the portfolio flow distribution. The
net effect on bond flows from a risk-off event is that the entire distribution moves to the left.
In the equity fund space, in contrast, while we observe that a risk-off shock negatively affects
the overall distribution, we also observe that a risk-off shock modestly brings in both the tails.
Further, the focus on the estimates derived from the model-based version of RORO suggest
that the reactions that we observe, while robust from a directional standpoint, do vary depending upon whether one separates out variation in risk aversion from variation in risk. Perhaps not surprisingly, variation in global risk is also important for emerging market mutual
fund flows.
Next, we turn to the distributional implications for emerging market returns. We find
that risk-off shocks negatively affect the worst return realizations more than they affect the
median return realization. Further, we find that are important differences across asset class
and currency denomination which are constitent across risk measures. Equity returns are
more sensitive than bond returns, and within asset classes, U.S. dollar indices are more sensitive than local currency indices.
Finally, we apply our framework to the COVID-19 shock. We examine the distributional
5

pattern of the flow and returns realizations in the face of the sizable risk-off nature of this
shock. In the COVID-19 era, a one standard deviation RORO shock expands (compresses)
the tail realizations of the weekly bond (equity) distribution by $45 ($6.8) million. A shock
equal in magnitude to the largest observation in the COVID-19 sample expands (compresses)
the tails realizations of the weekly bond (equity) distribution by $170.2 ($25.4) million. Using
the structural measure of risk aversion and risk from Bekaert et al (2020), our results suggest
that a one standard deviation shock composed of equal parts risk aversion and physical risk
separates the tails of the weekly bond (equity) distribution by $15.8 ($40.4) million.
Related Literature: Our paper is related to several strands of the literature on capital flows to
emerging markets. There is a vast literature on the role of global financial market conditions
and boom-bust cycles in emerging market capital flows and returns.3 This literature emphasizes the role of global push factors to explain the ebbs and flows in foreign investment allocations to emerging markets.
Global financial conditions that serve as push factors include advanced economy monetary policy, foreign investor risk aversion, international financial market liquidity, and exchange rate configurations. Forbes and Warnock (2012, 2019) show that global risk factors
drive emerging market capital flow surges, sudden stops and retrenchments. Jotikasthira et
al. (2012) report that ”global funds substantially alter portfolio allocations in emerging markets in response to funding shocks from their investor base.”4 Our paper contributes to the
literature on extreme capital flow movements by focusing on the distributions of capital flows
and returns conditional on the distribution of global risk factors.
There are different views in the literature about what constitutes or summarizes changes
to global risk sentiment. At the same time, the provenance of risk can differ over time. Focusing on market risk and investor sentiment, Bekaert et al. (2013), Miranda-Agrippino and
Rey (2019) and many others use the VIX as a proxy to measure the risk appetite of global investors. Fratzscher (2012) includes the TED spread as a measure of credit risk and liquidity

in international capital markets. Chari et al. (2020) use of high-frequency identification to extract U.S. monetary policy shocks using Treasury derivatives data to show that capital flows
to emerging markets are sensitive to term premium shocks in the U.S. yield curve. In this paper, we examine an amalgam of global shocks that collectively comprise global “risk-on” or
risk-off environments in international financial markets to investigate the distributional implications of emerging market capital flows and returns. To do so, our aim is also to arrive at a
measure of risk encapsulating the multi-faceted nature of global risk-on and risk-off states of
the world.
In doing so, our paper draws upon existing evidence documenting the relationship between unitary risk sources and risk appetite. One strand of the literature examines the impact
of U.S. monetary policy on global investor risk appetite (Bruno and Shin, 20015 a,b; Chari et
al., 2020; Gourinchas and Obstfeld, 2012). Bekaert et al., 2013; Miranda-Agrippino and Rey,
2019; and Bruno and Shin, 2015a) show that U.S. monetary policy changes impact global risk.
Expansionary monetary policy corresponds to global ”risk-on” while tightening monetary
policy shocks correlate with ”risk-off” states of the world. Risk-on and risk-off states correspond to changes in risk aversion holding fixed the quantity of risk. Our approach has the
advantage of measuring risk aversion using a structural model from Bekaert et. al. (2020)
that disentangles the price of risk (or risk aversion) from the quantity of risk.5 This literature
emphasizes the role risk premia as drivers of capital flows to emerging markets. Chari et al.
(2020) disentangle the channels through which U.S. monetary policy shocks can alter expectations hypothesis-driven yields and risk premia in the term structure of U.S. interest rates.
Via portfolio rebalancing and signaling, changes in domestic yields and risk premia can have
a significant impact on equity prices and bond yields in emerging markets. Bruno and Shin
(2015 a, b) propose an international risk-taking channel that underscores the role of liquidity
in dollar funding markets–phases of expansionary monetary policy increase the risk-bearing
capacity of financial intermediaries and drives international banking flows to emerging markets.
To proxy for global risk aversion, the literature documents the sensitivity of portfolio eq5 However, inference about this decomposition could suffer from the drawback that the model is incorrectly
specified.

uity flows to the VIX (Avdjiev et al. 2019; Rey 2015). Recent evidence draws attention to the
diminished relationship between the VIX and other key variables after 2008 (Forbes, 2020;
Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2020, Burcu et. al 2020). Avdjiev et al. (2017) attribute the declining role of the VIX to the shifting composition of global capital flows. Cerutti et al. (2019) suggest that correlation between the VIX and capital flows is limited to times of crisis and that the
role for the global financial cycle may have moderated. Burcu et. al (2020) point to a breakdown in the negative relationship between bank leverage and risk appetite since 2009 suggesting that the VIX is no longer a reliable proxy for the price of bank balance sheets. Forbes
and Warnock (2020) and Miranda-Agrippino et al. (2020) highlight a declining role in the information content of the VIX for explaining credit growth and capital flows. In contrast, the
parameter values using our composite risk-on risk-off measure are remarkably stable (if not
stronger) over time given that the measure captures alternative sources of risk. The underlying constituent sources of risk assert their importance or come to the forefront at different
points in time.
Our nearest neighbors in the literature are Gelos et. al (2019) who examine a “capital
flows-at-risk” model using a quantile regression framework, and Eguren-Martin et al (2020),
who examine the probability distribution of emerging market capital flows conditional on information contained in financial asset prices. Both papers propose to characterize the full distribution of capital flows in the face of shocks. Our paper differs from these in several ways.
First, using weekly data on flows and returns and daily risk measures, the frequency of our
outcome variables matches more closely to the risk measures. We thereby establish a tighter
link between the risk measure and our variables of interest, with less potential for confounding influences between the measure of the flow or return, and the event(s) driving changes in
risk or risk aversion.
Second, we focus our attention on global risk in particular, rather than taking a broader
look at “push” and “pull” factors, which Gelos et al (2019) consider individually and which
Eguren-Martin et al (2020) consider in a consolidated manner. Considering the former, a multifaceted measure of risk confers the advantages discussed previously compared to a unitary
risk measure like the BBB corporate spread used in Gelos et al (2019); namely, variable sources
of risk, geographic diversity, and plausible exogeneity. Eguren-Martin et al (2020) take an
8

approach more in line ours by putting forward the degree to which capital flows respond to
many types and sources of shocks, but their single-dimensional measure of global risk (in additional to a local risk factor calculated as a residual) does not allow for a decomposition into
global risk drivers. Likewise, our paper acknowledges, and attempts to characterize, the distinction between risk and risk aversion in shaping outcomes within the distribution.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 outlines the data and methodology for computing our risk-on risk off measures. Section 3 presents our baseline specification and the results from our quantile regression analysis. Section 4 presents a quantitative exercise which
demonstrates the distributional implications of our findings applied to the the Covid-19 crisis.
Section 5 concludes.

2.1

The Data
Computing Risk-on/Risk-off

To capture realized variation in global investor risk appetite, we consider two complementary
measures of Risk-On, Risk-Off (RORO). First, we build a measure from the first principle component of a multi-faceted set of daily data across several relevant asset markets. While definitely linked to variation in risk aversion, this measure may nevertheless confound information about variation in risk appetite with variation in physical risk. Hence, we also consider a
complementary model-based approach from Bekaert at al. (2020). This has the advantage of
measuring risk aversion using a structural model specifically designed to separate the price of
risk (or risk aversion) from the quantity of risk. However, inference about this separation may,
of course, be contaminated by any model mis-specification.
First, we construct a largely statistical RORO index in a manner similar to that described
in Datta et al (2017). Our RORO index comprises the z-score of the first principal component
of daily changes in several standardized asset market variables. We normalize components
such that positive changes imply risk-off behavior. Then, before taking the first principal component, we scale these normalized changes by their respective historical standard deviations.
Our first measure incorporates several series. To capture changes related to credit risk,
we use the change in the ICE BofA BBB Corporate Index Option-Adjusted Spread for the
9

United States and for the Euro Area, along with Moody’s BAA corporate bond yield relative
to 10-year Treasuries. To capture changes in risk aversion emanating from advanced economy equity markets, we use the additive inverse of daily total returns on the S&P 500, STOXX
50 and MSCI Advanced Economies Index, along with associated changes in option implied
volatilities from the VIX and the VSTOXX. To account for changes to funding liquidity, we include the daily average change in the G-spread on 2-, 5-, and 10-year Treasuries, along with
changes in in the TED spread, the 3-month LIBOR-OIS spread, and the bid-ask spread on 3month Treasuries. Finally, we include growth in the trade-weighted U.S. Dollar Index against
advanced foreign economies and the change in the price of gold. Figure 1 displays the time
series and histogram of the headline measure.
To shed light on different components of risk or risk aversion, we also construct four
sub-indices. These groupings, chosen to maximize the total explained variation of the components, fall into the four categories above: (1) spreads (credit risk), (2) advanced economy
equity returns and implied volatility, (3) funding liquidity, and (4) currency and gold. As in
the headline index, the subindices comprise the first principal component of the normalized
series. Table 1.1 displays summary statistics for the headline measure and subindices. Since
they are expressed as z-scores, we omit their means and standard deviations from the table.
Defining a risk measure comprising multiple sources of risk confers several advantages.
First, agglomerating multiple sources of risk allows us to abstract from any one source of riskoff behavior in our baseline analysis. Elevating any particular asset price in the measurement
of risk sentiment hazards the possibility that the relationship between the measure-asset and
the risk-affected-asset of interest arises from a particular set of market participants, the actions
of whom may not be generalizable across time and across assets. The group of market participants who take out, for example, S&P 500 options to hedge against U.S. equity volatility have
characteristics that may not extend equally to all other risk assets we might want to measure
in the face of a risk-off shock. Second, our multivariate measure of risk-on/risk-off further
permits the decomposition of baseline results into underlying drivers, offering insights into
the source of a given risk-on or risk-off event, which itself may differentially drive emerging
market capital flows and returns. Third, our measure recognizes sources outside of the United
States which may drive risk-on/risk-off changes. Finally, because we measure the relationship
10

of our index to assets in emerging markets, we can appeal to the small open economy character of the recipient markets to strengthen the plausibility of the index’s exogeneity to local
market fundamentals.
In recognition that the statistical approach used it deriving our first measure does not
structurally distinguish the price of risk (risk aversion) from the amount of risk (economic uncertainty), we also turn to the method employed in Bekaert, Engstrom, and Xu (2020; BEX)
for our second model-based RORO measure. Employing a wide set of macro and financial
market data, BEX build on the family of habit-based asset pricing models (see, for example,
Campbell and Cochrane (1999)) to separately identify variation in risk and risk aversion. We
collect their daily measures of each, using variation in risk aversion as our second RORO
measure.6
We present our first measure in Figure 1 (panels a and b), along with our second measure
based on the model-implied dis-aggregation into changes in risk aversion (our second RORO
measure in panel c) and risk (d). Both RORO measures exhibit (risk-off) skewness, excess kurtosis, and time varying volatility (see, also Table 1.1).Further, both measures show large spikes
during the global financial, the European debt, and the COVID-19 crises.

2.2

Capital Flows and Returns

In order to obtain a multilateral, high frequency proxy of capital flows into and out of emerging markets, we use the country flows dataset from EPFR Global. EPFR Global publishes
weekly portfolio investment flows by more than 14,000 equity funds and more than 7,000
bond funds, with more than USD 8 trillion of capital under management. The Country Flows
dataset combines EPFR’s Fund Flow and Country Weightings data to track the flow of money
into world equity and bond markets. While fund flow data reports the amount of cash flowing into and out investment funds, the country weightings report tracks fund manager allocations to each of the various markets in which they invest. Combining country allocations with
fund flows produces aggregate fund flows into and out of emerging markets (see Jotikasthira,
Lundblad, and Ramadorai (2012)). Because the country flows comprise the sum of fund-level
aggregate re-allocations, they come cleansed of valuation effects and therefore represent real

quantities.
To measure returns on emerging market portfolio assets, we collect daily total returns
from a number of well-known indices. Individual country returns on USD and local currency
bonds come from J.P. Morgan’s Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI) and the Bloomberg Barclay’s Local Bond Index, while we measure country-level equity returns using the Morgan
Stanley Capital International (MSCI) local currency and USD indices. Figure 2 and Table 1.2
display the times series and summary statistics for return and flow measures.
Reflecting the availability of EPFR data, the sample runs from January 7, 2004 to Apr. 15,
2020.7 The sample of countries comprises emerging markets appearing in each of the flow
and return data sets. Of these, we include countries with widespread recognition as emerging market economies.8 The final set of countries includes Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, the
Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the United
Arab Emirates.9

2.2.1

Control variables

The literature on patterns of international capital flows separates determinants into common,
global “push” factors associated with external shocks, and “pull” country-specific factors.
Our control variables include both “push” and “pull” variables suggested by the literature
on capital flows.
Following the literature on capital flow determinants (see, for example, Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart 1993; Fratzscher 2012; Fratzscher, Lo Duca, and Straub 2014; Passari and
Rey 2015; Milesi Ferretti and Tille 2011; Broner et al. 2013; Forbes and Warnock 2012), the capital flow and return regressions include a measure of advanced market returns (obtained from
Kenneth French’s website), the monetary policy stance of advanced economies as measured
by the shadow rate, and the advanced economy real GDP growth.10 We use year fixed effect

exclude China due to its unique characteristics, including its size relative to other emerging market
economies and measurement issues.
9 EM classifications considered include the IMF, BRICS + Next 11, FTSE, MSCI, S&P, EMBI, Dow Jones, Russell,
Columbia University EMPG and BBVA.
10 All advanced economy variables comprise a USD real GDP-weighted average of the United States, the UK, the
euro area and Japan.

control for global conditions more broadly, as well as a lag of the left-hand-side variable to account for the autocorrelation introduced by scaling over lagged positions. Time fixed effects
account both for slow moving business cycles and structural changes in the market for ETFs
and mutual funds.
Country-specific (pull factor) controls (see, for example, Ahmed and Zlate 2014; Forbes
and Warnock 2012; Fratzscher 2012; Fratzscher, Lo Duca, and Straub 2013; Eichengreen and
Gupta 2014; Moore et al. 2013; Chen, Mancini Griffoli, and Sahay 2014) include local policy
rates, average real GDP growth in the previous eight quarters, and the broad real effective
exchange rate (REER). To control for the influence of local macroeconomic news in the intervening week or day, we include the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (CESI) for emerging
markets. The CESI tracks how economic data compare to expectations, rising when economic
data exceed economists’ consensus forecasts and falling when data come in below forecast
estimates.11
With the exception of emerging market news surprises, all control variables enter with
a lag to rule out simultaneity.12 Both sets of controls affect capital flows and returns, but also
likely react directly to changes in risk sentiment. In fact, our advanced economy push variables not only react to risk-on/risk-off shocks but likely also drive them. All daily variables
enter as the weekly moving average leading up to the week’s EPFR reporting date; thus, lagged
variables consist of the weekly moving average ending on the date one week before the report
of the measured flow.

11 Indices are defined as weighted historical standard deviations of data surprises (actual releases vs. Bloomberg
survey median) and are calculated daily in a rolling three-month window. The weights of economic indicators are
derived from relative high-frequency spot FX impacts of one standard deviation data surprises. The indices also
employ a time decay function to replicate the limited memory of markets.
12 While news surprises likely drive capital flows and returns, it is unlikely that the risk shock drives news surprises or vice versa on any given date.

Baseline Specification

With risk indicators in hand, we regress weekly EPFR country-level flows and daily returns
onto our risk appetite measures using the panel quantile regression approach of Machado and
Santos Silva (2019) with country and time fixed effects, controlling for the “push” and “pull”
factors described previously. Country level flows enter as a percent of the previous week’s allocation, while total returns are expressed as a daily percentage change. As stated in the data
description, in the EPFR flow regressions, changes in the risk measures are aggregated by a
moving average.

In general, risk-on, risk-off shocks have important implications not only for the median
of emerging market flows and returns, but also for the tails of the distribution. In each case,
a risk-off shock decreases flows and returns across the distribution. Further, in nearly every
case we consider, the “worst” realizations (in the left tail) change more than the median realization, and the “best” (right tail) realizations change less than the median, lengthening the
tails of the distribution (| β(.05) | > | β(.5) | > | β(.95) |). We summarize the results in Figures 3a
- 4d, while Tables 2a - 3.2d isolate the risk-off regression coefficients for each case. As a reminder, each regression includes controls and various fixed effects; full results with all control
variable coefficients are available in the Internet Appendix (Tables 4 - 6).
13 In

order to better understand the role for the various subcomponents that constitute our first RORO measure,
we also consider a version of the panel quantile regression where Risk t is a vector of the constituent subindices.

3.2

Risk-off Shocks and RORO

First, we consider the case where we measure risk off shocks, RAt , using our statistical RORO
index. Figure 3a summarizes the impact of a one standard deviation risk-off shock (measured
in this way) on the distribution of our EPFR flow measures and offers an object lesson in the
importance of measuring the impact across the distribution. While the risk-off shock affects
the median of the distribution in a similar manner across asset classes, the tails behave differently. We observe that the risk-off shock decreases bond outflow realizations in the left tail
more than it decreases the median realization, and in turn decreases the highest inflow realizations less then the median. The net result is a leftward shift in the distribution, with a
lengthening of the tails. Notably, as we will see in a later exercise, the lengthening in the left
tail causes “large” outflow realizations in the unconditional distribution to appear more common in the post-shock distribution. Second, the equity flow distribution also shifts to the left
in the face of a risk-off shock; however, the largest outflow realizations change less than the
median, while the largest inflow realizations change more than the median. The net result is
a leftward shift in the distribution, with a modest shortening of the tails. This is an important
exception to the more general findings.
Figure 3b summarizes the the impact of a one standard deviation risk-off shock ( on the
distribution of fixed income and equity returns. Across all return types, a risk-off shock shifts
the distribution to the left and lengthens the tails, worsening the most negative return realizations more than the median. The magnitude and dispersion of the impact, however, differs between fixed income and equity, and between local currency and USD denominated
indices. In particular, a risk-off shock impacts the total return on the equity indices at a rate
more than five times the impact on fixed income returns. Within each asset class, dollar returns react more than local currency returns. Fixed income bears this relationship out strikingly, decreasing three to six times the rate of the local currency index in the face of the risk
off shock.14 MSCI USD total returns decrease 28 - 32% more than the local currency equity
returns in the face of a risk-off shock.
14 While

the impact on the local currency index is statistically insignificant, the comparison is still a useful one
given that USD denominated bonds do react in a statistically significant manner.

3.3

Risk-off Shocks and BEX (2020)

Given the aforementioned limitations of measuring risk-off shocks with a statistical measure,
we next turn to a structural decomposition that facilitates a separation of risk aversion from
physical risk. Figures 4a and 4b summarize the changes in the capital flow distributions when
we employ Bekaert et al’s (2020) risk aversion. Specifically, RAt is measured as the change in
the risk aversion component from that model (note that we also include the model’s implication for variation in the quantity of risk as a control). This approach reveals an interesting
pattern underlying the heterogeneous reactions of the equity and fixed income distributions.
The impact of risk aversion (and risk itself) on the distribution of fixed income flows follows the same pattern as with our first RORO measure; that is, a risk-off shock measured in
this alternative way again shifts the distribution to the left and lengthens the tails relative to
the median. Interestingly, variation in the quantity of risk has a larger impact across the distribution and puts more weight in the left tail compared to risk aversion itself; this is the case
across asset classes. Where bonds and equity funds (and returns) differ in their reactions in
the dispersive impact of risk aversion shocks. This distinction offers a window into the workings of our statistical measure and enables us to consider risk measurement and co-movement
more generally.
In particular, equity flows react to variation in both risk and risk aversion in a manner
which sheds light on the distribution’s reaction to our first statistical risk-off measures. In
the face of a physical risk shock, the distribution of equity flows reacts in step with the distribution of bond flows in that we observe a leftward shift, with tails lengthening relative to
the median. In contrast, a risk-off shock (the change in risk aversion) causes the equity flow
distribution to behave as it does with our first RORO measure, with the range of the distribution shrinking as it shifts left. This suggests that the distributional reaction that we observe
with a RORO shock based on our first measure emanates from a sensitivity to changing risk
aversion, which causes a convergence of realizations relative to the unconditional distribution
(and to the distribution conditional on risk-off shocks to physical risk).
Figures 4c and 4d depict the changes in the return distributions when we replace our statistical measures of risk with Bekaert et al’s (2020) risk and risk aversion indices. Here we ob-

16

serve that a risk-off shock (to risk aversion), as well as a shock to physical risk, shift the distribution of returns to the left. However, changes in the level of risk dramatically lengthen the
tails of the return distribution, while changes in risk aversion shrink the tails. From the perspective of understanding the drivers of tail risk in particular, it is notable that in both asset
classes, a risk-off shock to physical risk or uncertainty weighs heavily on negative tail events
in a manner which would clearly be masked by the conditional mean and variance.
The relative impact of the two components on returns differs between asset classes. Between the two, risk aversion plays a larger role in driving equity returns relative to the influence of risk, and the opposite holds (albeit less systematically) for fixed income returns. Given
the relative magnitude of the two effects, the joint impact of a combined and equal-magnitude
shock in each of the components would net out to a leftward shift and a lengthening in the
tails.

3.4

Risk-on Risk-off Constituents

Figures 5a and 5b provide a more nuanced picture of our RORO index using a nested panel
regression that includes the constituent sub-components.15 Including the constituent measures together suggests that much of the baseline’s “shifting” impetus emanates in large part
from corporate spreads for both equity and bond funds. The nested model also reveals funding liquidity as a prime source of the bond funds’ “tails-out” behavior relative to equity funds.
Interestingly, once we include credit risk in the model with the advanced economy equity and
volatility factor, the latter evinces less impact on equity funds and even moves median-plus
realizations to the right, reflecting the risk-off behavior of rotating out of equities and into
bonds. We see this reflected in equity funds’ reaction to Bekaert et al’s (2020) measure of risk
aversion.
Figure 5c again shows how emerging market returns react to the various elements of our
RORO index, considered together. Here, advanced economy returns and volatilities, along
with corporate spreads, drive the much of the overall magnitude of the distributional shift.
This is more so the case for equity returns compared to fixed income returns, reflecting comovements in global equity returns documented elsewhere in the literature. However, asset
15 The

full regression results for each case are available in the Internet Appendix (Table 6).

17

classes and currencies all share increased distributional dispersion emanating primarily from
credit risk as measured by corporate spreads. In the case of equity returns, the “tails-out” impetus from a risk-off credit risk shock counteracts the “tails-in” impetus from advanced economy equity return shocks. Here again we see a mapping to our chosen structural measures—
Figure 4d suggests that risk shocks lengthen the tails enough to outweigh risk aversion’s distributional compression. The net result of both the structural and statistical measures, then, is
to increase the incidence of extreme realizations.
Comparatively smaller reactions stem from the other two component indices. Currency
risk acts as a shift factor which, while always smaller in size than returns or spreads, contributes more to risk-off reactions in dollar denominated returns. Finally, across asset classes
and currency denominations, the impact of funding liquidity barely registers, contributing
little in the way of shifts or dispersion and almost always statistically insignificant.

3.5

Flight to Safety

A question that naturally arises when examining the relationship between risk appetite and
the allocation to or pricing of risky assets relates to the complementary implication for socalled “safe” assets. A safe asset is a simple debt instrument that is expected to preserve its
value across various states of the world including adverse, possibly systemic events. Under
this definition, the categorization of what assets exactly are to be considered “safe” remains a
point of discussion (see Gorton (2016) and Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2017) as examples among many, many others). However, U.S. Treasury bonds are generally considered to
be safe under this definition, and we will focus here.
Accordingly, we test the degree to which our various risk aversion measures reflect a
flight-to-safety by repeating the above exercise replacing EPFR emerging market (risky asset) flows with the growth rate of assets held in U.S. money market mutual funds. These data
are published by the Investment Company Institute, which reports money market fund assets
to the Federal Reserve each week. To isolate safe assets, we focus on the subset of funds that
invest in U.S. government debt.
In this exercise, we retain most of our global “push” variables: advanced economy market returns, advanced economy GDP growth, and the average advanced economy monetary
18

stance as measured by the shadow rate. We also retain year fixed effects. We run the following regression:
(q)

gt
(q)

Where gt

(q)

(q)

= α(q) + δt + β(q) RAt + γ1 PUSHtk + et

(3)

is the weekly growth rate of government money market assets in quantile q, and

RAt , exactly as above, is either our RORO index or the risk/risk aversion decomposition from
Bekaert et al. (2020).
Table 4 summarizes the results. In columns (1)-(4), we observe that risk-off RORO shocks
drive inflows into Treasury-focused money market funds across the distribution of fund flows;
this appear to be particularly true for the right tail, where larger inflows becomes more likely
in the face of a risk-off shock. In columns (5)-(8), we show complementary results for the
BEX decomposition. A shock to physical risk has some positive effect on government money
market fund flows (although this effect is not consistent across the distribution). Risk aversion (risk-off) shocks drive the left tail of the distribution toward the median, but we do not
observe statistically significant impacts elsewhere in the distribution. To examine these effects further, we separate these fund flows (in Internet Appendix Table 7) into two subsets
of government money market funds, those available to institutions vs. those available to retail investors. We find that the largest effects documented in Table 4 are associated with institutional money market fund flows. Retail flows are considerably less sensitive to risk-off
shocks. Taken together, we do detect across our various specifications some reaction to riskoff shocks in the allocation to safe assets in a manner that complements what we observe for
risky assets.

Quantitative Exercise: An Application to the COVID-19 Crisis

The market turmoil surrounding the global transmission of COVID-19 in early 2020 generated movements in both emerging market portfolio assets and measures of risk that match
or exceed the magnitude of other widely recognized risk-off events. Our approach allows us
to quantify how the distribution of capital flow realizations changed in the face of COVID-

19

19 shocks and how the sources of risk therein generated patterns distinct from other risk-off
events. To quantify the impact of COVID-19 and other large risk-off periods, we undertake
two exercises using fitted values from our analysis. First, we show counterfactual quantiles
of the post-shock distribution of flows and compare them to the recent history of the data as
follows. We define predicted capital flows k̂q as
k̂q = kq + β̂q ∗ shock ∗ H

(4)

where k̂q is the estimated flow calculated from fitted values, kq is the qth percentile observed
country flow per week in the data since Jan. 2020, H is the average assets under management,
and shock is the 10th percentile shock realization in the COVID era (3.1 units). Table 5 reveals
the economic magnitudes underlying the parameter values reported in the results.
Starting with bond flows, in the face of a unit shock, the median reallocation is an outflow of $14.09 million, compared to a pre-shock 2020 median weekly inflow of $3.7 million.
This size shock increases outflow realizations in the 5th quantile by $22 million per week,
compared to $17.8 million per week at the median. Inflow realizations at the 95th quantile decrease by $14.8 million. A one standard deviation shock, 3.1 units, increases outflow realization by $68.03 million, compared to a change of $55.2 million at the median and $43.5 million
at the 95th quantile. In the peak observation of the COVID-19 crisis, the index reached 11.56
standard deviations, suggesting that Q5, Q50 and Q95 would fall by $256.7 million, $205.9
million, and $162.14 million respectively. A shock of this size pulls the tail realizations apart
by $92 million.
As aforementioned, equity flows show a shrinking of the tails in the event of a risk-off
shock. After a one unit shock, the median reallocation is an outflow of $18.84, compared to a
pre-shock 2020 median outflow of $5.8 million. This size shock increases outflow realizations
in the 5th quantile by $16.28 million per week, compared to $18.8 million per week at the median. Inflow realizations at the 95th quantile decrease by $21.4 million. A one standard deviation shock, 3.1 units, increases outflow realization by $50.5 million, compared to a change
of $58.4 million at the median and $66.3 million at the 95th quantile. In the peak observation
of the COVID-19 crisis, the index reached 11.56 standard deviations, suggesting that Q5, Q50

20

and Q95 would fall by $188.2 million, $217.7 million, and $247.3 million respectively. A shock
of this size pulls the tail realizations in by $59 million. Under the peak shock, even the “best”
realizations manifest as equity fund outflows.
Second, we fit a kernel density to the predicted values to visualize changes in the flow or
return distribution from a 3-unit risk-off shock, displayed in Figure 7. We show 3-unit shocks
because this magnitude represents the threshold of the 10th percentile among risk-off shocks
in 2020. The fitted distribution of fixed income flows has longer tails and is more highly skewed
toward outflows compared to the unconditional distribution (-.61 vs. -1.01). In terms of magnitude, in the face of a 3-unit shock, what would be a tail event in the unconditional distribution looks more like a 10th quantile shock, and therefore more probable. The post-shock
median now falls in the bottom 25% of pre-shock realizations. The equity flow distribution
appears unchanged in terms of skewness, although here as well the post-shock median falls
in the bottom 25% of pre-shock realizations.
The return distributions show more dramatic changes still, although the skewness of the
distributions show little change. What the unconditional equity distribution would label a tail
outcome lay near the median in the post-shock distribution. While our RORO shock affects
EMBI returns to a comparatively smaller degree, the pre-shock tail event still falls within the
interquartile range of the unconditional distribution.
Figure 8 repeats this exercise for the subcomponents of Bekaert et al (2020). The conditional distributions attributed to each subcomponent in these figures represents the response
of the distribution to a three standard deviation shock to one factor, controlling for the other.
We see that, for bond flows, risk aversion and risk contribute in roughly equal measure to the
increased mass of value under the left tail, while risk represents the greater force in pushing
equity outcomes past the 5th quantile of the unconditional equity flow distribution. In contrast, risk aversion plays a larger role in worsening negative return distributions, particularly
in bond returns.

Conclusion and Future Directions

Risk-on/risk-off shocks have important distributional implications for emerging market portfolio flows and returns. In particular, we find that the effects associated with the worst realizations are often disproportionately affected by risk-off shocks. Specifically, while there are
some differences in the effects across bond vs. equity markets and flows vs. asset returns, the
effects associated with the left tail are generally larger than that on the median realization. We
conclude that the focus in the literature on measures of central tendency is incomplete.
A natural next question for our research agenda: do the implications of a RORO shock
differ across recipient countries? Given that the mutual fund business exhibits significant
variation in manager discretion, the heterogeneity question has two dimensions. The first is
country-level heterogeneity, meaning are the effects of an external RORO shock disproportionately experienced across countries along important dimensions. Gelos et al. (2019) show
that variation in recipient country economic policy and business fundamentals affect capital
flows. In the context of our setting, the question arises whether recipient country conditions
impact fund reallocation in the face of risk-off shocks. In particular, we want to be able to
address the extent to which fund managers view emerging markets as a single asset class or
whether country fundamentals matter for fund allocations.
An important caveat, however, is that the level of discretion fund managers possess varies
considerably across fund type. Representing about half of the emerging market fund space
towards the end of the sample, passive index funds and ETFs have very little manager discretion. As a consequence, passive index fund and ETF re-allocation in the face of a risk-off
shock may induce elevated correlations among countries and minimize the effect of crosscountry heterogeneity. Actively managed mutual funds, however, enjoy considerable discretion. Country fundamentals may be central to their allocation decision. Going forward, we
will assess the complete effect of tail events on capital flows by closely examining the actual
vehicles that investors use to access emerging markets.
