This paper takes a fresh look at the effectiveness of

sterilized intervention in the light of recent experience.

The paper concludes that sterilized intervention, in itself,
has played an unimportant role in
promoting
exchange-rate
realignment. Instead, clear shifts in patterns of monetary and
fiscal policy appear to have been the main medium-term policy
factors determining currency values. Over certain shorter time
periods, intervention has influenced exchange

a

signalling channel; but this signalling effect has been operative

But ultimately there are limits to what can be achieved by a pure
intervention policy. The monetary crises under the Bretton Woods

system showed that powerful market trends cannot be suppressed
through exchange market interventions by central banks, and more
recent monetary history has reaffirmed this.

expressed as dollars per foreign currency unit. Between December
1978 and August 1985, the U.S. price level had risen by a
greater percentage than Japan's or Cermany's had, so even a
complete reversal of the nominsl exchange-rate movements up to
February 1985 would not have restored the real exchange rates
prevailing at the period's start.

monetary expansion could cause an immediate rise in the short-term

strongly to monetary expansion. This possibility does not seem
very relevant to the three main industrial countries: central
bankers
seem confident
of their ability to lower short-term
interest rates in the short run, and some formal econometric tests
(such as tests based on money announcements) support their view.

In part, the exchange market reaction reflected the fact that the
announcement was unexpected. More importantly, market participants

noted that the initiative had come from the United States and
viewed it as a change in the U.S. government's previously
perceived attitude of accepting or even welcoming the strong
dollar, In addition, the agreement was interpreted as eliminating
the likelihood that the Federal Reservo would tighten
conditions in response to rapid U.S. monetary growth.'3

than output growth is reported because the former variable is a
more direct measure of pressure on the exchange rate, in the
Mundell-Fleming model, for example, an increase in domestic demand
can cause ths home currency to appreciate even though output does
not change. (See Mundell 1968; a more recent analytical discussion
of the effects of demand factors on real and nominal exchange
rates is in Obstfeld 1985.) The movements in government deficits

change in the relative stocks of national-currency bonds held by
the public, that is, a change that is not accompanied by a change

in the monetary base.'9

of any other policy.) Section III below discusess the linkage

2The implication of Ricardian equivalence, that the government
does not change outside asset supplies when it conducts sterilized
intervention, has already been mentioned. Backus and Kehos (1988),
in a non-Ricardian model with risk-averse investors, present other
examples of sterilized interventions that have no effects. Suppose
that the dollar.mark rate will be $S(w) per mark next period if

For many students of central bank policy the psychology of the
announcement is the most important and perhaps the only important
aspect of the discount rate, Unfortunately there is little of a
systematic character that ten be said shout it. Will the public
conclude from the announcement of a fell in the discount rate that
predictions of recession are now confirmed by the expert economic
intelligence of the central benk, and therefore regard the
announcement as a deflationary portent? Or will the market judge
that the authorities have tbua indicated their resolute intention
of preventing deflation, arresting and reversing the recession,
and accordingly interpret the announcement as an inflationary
sign? What do the authorities themselves regard as the likely
psychological effects of their announcements? Clearly it is easy
to become enmeshed in a game of infinite regress between the
central bank and the market.

government will be motivated nor only by its own budgetary needs
but by its potential ability to alter the net real foreign asset
position of the domestic private sector, For example, if the
domestic public has a net foreign debt denominated in horn
currency, the government has an added incentive to inflate. The
welfare effects of policy-induced wealth zedistributions from
foreigners to domestic residents are likely to be large corpared
with the costs of tax distortions

portfolio composition is indeterainste in equilibrium, as is the
direction
of the wealth redistribution associated with an
exchsnge-rate change. In this setting, the government might well
lack sufficient information to calculate the effect on net foreign

Stein (1988) presents a simplc incomplete-information model

can credibly announce a range of future exchange-rate targets,
even though the announcement of any precise policy target is not
credible. Aside from rationalizing the recent 6-7 practice of

indicating only broad target ranges for exchange rates, Stein's

Intervention may be costly foc a government, as noted earlier,

foreign reserve inflow (and not just the sterilized portion) is

in the face of market pressure, rather

than compromise domestic policy goals. Substantial departures from

heavy intervention,

11 and 14. As noted below, the dollar depreciated over 1987, so

the V 5.1 billion figure understates the expansionary pressure on
Japan's money supply; it includes the negative effect of capital
losses on official dollar reserves measured in yen. Such capital
losses do not directly reduce the high-powered money supply.
