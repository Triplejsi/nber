Nevertheless, no one has analyzed the relation

This paper characterizes the changes in stock market volatility through
time.

In particular, the goal is to relate stock market volatility to the

time-varying volatility of a variety of economic vsriables.

Relative to the

1857-1986 period, volatility was unusually high from 1929-1940 for many
economic series, including inflation, money growth, industrial production, and

This is consistent with conditional volatility being

an integrated moving average process,

so shocks to volatility have both

that the sum of the autoregressivecoefficients is reliably different from
unity using the tables in Fuller[1976].

However,

Schwert[l987,1988] shows

that the Fuller critical values are misleading in situations such as this.
The estimation error from using a single absolute error in (2b) biases the
unit root estimates

toward srationarity.3 The results for the estimate of

stock volatility from daily data support this conclusion, since the sum of the
autoregressivecoefficients is closer to unity, and the rest statistic is

the conditional variance of security prices is proportional to the conditional

it is plausible that a

Since common stocks reflect claims on future profits of corporations,

it is

plausible that the volatility of real economic activity is a major determinant

of stock return volatility. In

Summary

statistics for these estimates are in Tables 2A and 2B.
Industrial production volatility in Figure 4a was high during the midl930s,

during World War I, and especially

during the post-World War II period.

There is a small increase in volatility duriog the 1973-1974 recession.

volatility of this series before 1929.

With this series, especially,

The volatility of the growth rate of the liabilities of business failures

Surprisingly,

over time.

Thus,

this relation is not stable

From Figures 1 and Sm, payout rose during 1929-1940 as did stock

volatility. Payout fell during the 1973-1986 period when stock volatility
rose.

These opposite associations suggest there is no stable relation between

earnings or dividend policy and stock volatility.
4.2 Relation of Bond Yields with Volatility
Figures 6a and 6b plot the spreads between medium (Baa) and high (As) grade
corporate long-termbonds (MedbondHibond) and between long and short-term
high grade bonds

(HibondInt) respectively.

Assuming that Moody's rating

classes reflect consistent information over time, the spread between yields on
different bonds of different quality should measure the price of default risk.
Thus,

the plot in Figure

6s should vary with uncertainty about

corporate

profitability, and should be related to stock volatility. Indeed, quality
yield spreads are higher in 1929-1940 than in the subsequent periods.

They

also increase in the OPEC period end since 1979.
The spread between long and short-termyields in Figure 6b reflects a
different phenomenon.

Given that stock volatility has changed substantially ovet time, it is
interesting to ask why it has changed.

This papet analyzes many factots

related to stook volatility, but it does not test for causes of stock ptice

the hypotheses involve associations between stock

factors such as consumption and production opportunities and preferences would
determine all of these parameters (e.g., Abel[1988] or Cenotte and

Joint Effects of Leverage and Macroeconomic Volatility

additional nonfinancial factor.

pp. A252A2663 . For 1657-1874, I estimate clearings outside of New York City using the
average fraction of clearings in New York for lg75-1884 (70.664 percent), so

13. Money Supply,

1867-1986

I use the monetary base (referred to as high-powered
money in Friedman
and Schwartz[1963J). For 1867-1960, I use data from Friedman and
Schwartz[1963, Table 8-3, column (1), pp. 799-808J for rhe base.
For 19611986, I use the seasonally adjusted monetary base reported by the Federal
Reserve Board from Citibase[1978]. These series are spliced
together using
the average ratio of the respective series during 1960.
Thus, the base data
since 1960 are multiplied by 1.127538.
The Friedman and Schwartz data are

reported on a monthly basis beginning in May 1907. From June 1878 through
April 1907, I use a monthly monetary base series from the National Bureau of
Economic Research (NBER) multiplied by the average ratio of the Friedman and
Schwartz series to the NBER series for 1878-1914, 1.006948.
These data were
provided by Professor Robert Barro. Thus, there are continuous monthly data
on growth rates of the base from July 1878 through December 1986.
