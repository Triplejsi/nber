is true also of average cost measures computed with this model,
there is a large differencebetween the markup of price over
and over average cost. This suggests that previous methods that do
not well distinguishmarginal from average costs, or assume they are the
same may contain serious biases that fluctuate over time. The estimates
suggest a declining markup over average cost over time. Combined with the
PRAT measures above this implies that average costs are increasing relative
to marginal cost over time. Since MC—AC+Y.ÔAC/8Y, this implies a decrease
in Y.3AC/8Y if increasingreturns to scale exist so ÔAC/JY is negative.
Thus cost curves may be shifting to the right over time so available returns
to scale are increasing.
This is consistentwith evidence on returns to
scale outlined below.
17This contrasts with estimates generated in studies like Hall [1986) using
nonparametricmethods. Most of this deviation can be attributed to the
gross output as contrasted to value added framework used here since
Domowitz, Hubbard and Peterson have shown that including materials should
reduce the estimated margin by a factor of (l-eM) where
is the share of
materials in output.
Since °M is approximately 60%, this implies a valueadded markup of approximately 45% to 60% which is in the range of the Hall
estimates.
Such a comparison is not strictly applicable, however, since
both capital and labor are quasi-fixed in the current model.
