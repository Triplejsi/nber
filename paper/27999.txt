The Long-Run Effects of the Affordable Care Act: A Pre-Committed Research Design Over
the COVID-19 Recession and Recovery

ABSTRACT
The long-run costs and benefits of social insurance expansions may not be realized until a
program has been in place through a cycle of boom, bust, and recovery. In the case of the
Affordable Care Act (ACA), the arrival of the program's inaugural bust and recovery have been
hastened by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, our analysis begins by developing two
facts. First, during the pre-pandemic boom, we show that the ACA's effects had largely stabilized
by 2016. Second, we develop a new fact involving variations in the ACA's effects across
industries. Specifically, we show that the ACA’s effects differed dramatically across industries
with lower versus higher levels of pre-ACA insurance coverage, and that this difference cannot
be explained by differences in workers’ incomes or other observable characteristics, nor by
geographic differences in pre-ACA uninsured rates. Finally, we set the stage for pre-committed
analyses of the ACA's effects over the remainder of the current cycle of boom, bust, and
recovery. In so doing, we seek to advance the use of pre-committed research designs in
observational settings.

Introduction

A primary goal of social insurance programs is to cushion households against otherwise
uninsurable shocks. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), for example, improves insurance access
for those who lose jobs during recessions. Because recessions occur irregularly, the ACA’s
benefits cannot be fully understood until we observe its performance during an economic
downturn. Similarly, the distortions created by social insurance programs may take years to
fully unfold. A cycle of boom, bust, and recovery is likely necessary before workers and firms
respond fully to the ACA’s inducements and implicit taxes.
Because of adjustment frictions, it is important for comprehensive analyses of social
insurance programs to adopt a long-run perspective. To date, however, evaluations of the
ACA’s impacts have necessarily been short-run in nature. This reflects the fact that the U.S.
experienced a 128-month economic expansion that began nearly a year prior to the adoption
of the ACA and continued through February 2020. In this paper, we set the stage for precommitted analyses of the ACA’s effects over the dramatic churn linked to the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic.
Prior research on the ACA has focused on three dimensions along which the law sought
to expand insurance coverage. The first is the Dependent Coverage Mandate, which allowed
young adults ages 18 and older to remain on their parents’ employer-sponsored private health
insurance until age 26. The second is state Medicaid expansions to individuals in households
with incomes up to 138 percent of the Federal poverty line. The third involves a mix of
regulations, mandates, and subsidies that have reshaped the non-group insurance market
and, to a lesser extent, the landscape of employer coverage offerings.

1

Research on the ACA’s short-run effects have found its impacts on insurance coverage
to be substantial (Akosa Antwi et al., 2013; Kaestner et al., 2017; Courtemanche et al.,
2017; Frean et al., 2017; Soni et al., 2017). Additional analyses have found evidence of
positive impacts on beneficiaries’ financial well-being (Brevoort et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2018)
and access to health care (Ghosh et al., 2017; Courtemanche et al., 2018a; Wherry and
Miller, 2016), while effects on health outcomes are modest in some studies (Courtemanche
et al., 2018b; Wherry and Miller, 2016) and more substantial in others (Miller et al., 2019).
Intriguingly, there has been relatively little evidence of impacts of Medicaid expansion on
either employer insurance offerings (Frean et al., 2017) or households’ labor supply (Kaestner
et al., 2017; Duggan et al., 2019; Moriya et al., 2016; Mathur et al., 2016; Duggan et al., 2020).
These latter findings are surprising in that they imply smaller effects than were projected by
the Congressional Budget Office (Elmendorf, 2010, 2011; Harris and Mok, 2015; Ellis, 2015).
Specifically, CBO projected that several million individuals would, on net, lose employer
provided coverage (Elmendorf, 2010) and that the ACA might reduce the number of employed
persons by around 800,000 (Elmendorf, 2011). It is not yet knowable, however, whether this
discrepancy reflects forecasting errors or the short-run nature of existing analyses.
This paper proceeds with three objectives. First, we update existing analyses of the shortto medium-run effects of the ACA’s key provisions. Second, we explore a new dimension of
heterogeneity in the impact of the ACA’s key provisions: insurance coverage rates in the
industries in which workers are employed. Third, we lay the groundwork for pre-committed
analyses of the ACA’s long-run effects.
Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS), we begin by extending existing analyses of the ACA’s relatively short- to medium-run effects through 2018. Our initial
2

analysis focuses on the ACA’s Medicaid expansions. Consistent with Kaestner et al. (2017),
Miller et al. (2019), and Ghosh et al. (2017), we find that Medicaid expansions have resulted
in substantial increases in Medicaid coverage, moderately less coverage purchased through insurance exchanges, and modestly less employer coverage. On net, this combination of impacts
delivers non-trivial declines in the likelihood that individuals lack insurance coverage. We
observe that the short-to-medium-run effects of Medicaid expansions appeared to stabilize
by 2016, with little additional change between 2016 and 2018.
Next, we augment prior work through a focus on variations in insurance coverage across
industries. Past work has focused primarily on individuals with low levels of education or on
geographic regions with low levels of coverage at baseline. We show that Medicaid expansions
also had substantial impacts on coverage among individuals in industries with low baseline
coverage rates. Importantly, differential impacts on low-coverage (relative to high-coverage)
industries persist after re-weighting our samples of high- and low-coverage industries to match
on individual-level income, education, other observable characteristics, and core-based statistical area (CBSA)-specific uninsured rates. That is, to shed evidence on whether differences
in the ACA’s impacts across industries were driven by observable differences in individuals’ characteristics, we apply several sets of weights generated through a Coarsened Exact
Matching procedure (Iacus et al., 2012). We find that substantial differences in the impact
of Medicaid expansions remain after we re-weight based on sets of variables that include all
key variables from prominent analyses of heterogeneity in the ACA’s effects. This analysis
thus documents a new dimension of heterogeneity in the ACA’s impacts on the insurance
landscape. Variations across industries may be quite important for documenting the ACA’s
long-run effects, as the COVID-19 recession has come with substantial, industry-level varia3

tions in the degree of economic disruption.
We also extend analyses of ACA provisions that took force nationally. This portion of
our analysis, which uses sub-state variations in regions’ exposure to the ACA’s key provisions, most directly follows the approach taken by Courtemanche et al. (2017, 2018b). These
earlier analyses of sub-state dimensions of the ACA’s effects have long provided evidence of
substantial insurance gains associated with the ACA’s full set of provisions. Through 2018,
we find that rates of uninsurance were reduced by roughly 45 percent in states that expanded
Medicaid and 15 percent in states that had not expanded Medicaid. While most of these
gains had materialized by 2016, modest additional gains accrued in 2017 and 2018.
Our final objective is to set the stage for analyses of the ACA’s long-run effects. In doing
so, we seek to make progress in the development of pre-committed research designs in nonexperimental contexts. The COVID-19 pandemic creates circumstances that are uniquely
suitable for designing pre-committed analyses of the “long-run” effects of the ACA’s key
provisions. By “long-run” effects, we refer to effects that capture the adjustment of insurance
and labor markets following a period of substantial churn. The COVID-19 pandemic has
severed employment relationships on an unprecedented scale. The “shape” and precise timing
of recovery are uncertain. An initial employment recovery occurred in May and June of 2020,
and to a lesser extent in July, August, and September. While employment rates are likely
to remain below pre-pandemic levels for an extended period of time, substantial recovery
towards those levels will likely continue over the last months of 2020 and first half of 2021.
Our pre-committed analyses take a standard “event-study” structure. That is, we precommit to updating analyses that dynamically track the effects of the ACA’s provisions over
time. Within this structure, our pre-committed analyses relate to specific, empirically testable
4

hypotheses. With respect to the ACA’s benefits, for example, we hypothesize that loweducation individuals will experience smaller increases in their probability of being uninsured
during the pandemic if they live in states that enacted ACA Medicaid expansions. While
the direction of this effect may be fully expected, its magnitude is in need of quantification.
With respect to the ACA’s costs, we hypothesize that the bust and recovery associated
with the pandemic will lead to greater declines in employer insurance offerings in states
that enacted ACA Medicaid expansions. We further hypothesize that these effects will be
particularly large in industries and geographic areas that are disproportionately impacted
by both COVID-19 and the initial implementation of the ACA.
As detailed below, the tests of our pre-specified hypotheses will involve comparisons of
coefficients within our event study specifications. We will treat the 2020 calendar year as a
year of substantial economic downturn, and the 2021 and 2022 calendar years as years of
recovery and/or returns towards pre-pandemic conditions. Key sensitivity checks within our
pre-specified research design will involve controls for the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic
itself. That is, we pre-commit to running a set of specifications that will investigate whether
our long-run estimates of the effects of Medicaid expansions are sensitive to controlling for
heterogeneity in the COVID-19 pandemic’s direct impacts on health and economic well-being.
Finally, we pre-commit to exploring heterogeneity in the long-run effects of the ACA by the
magnitudes of industry-specific employment shocks caused by the COVID-19 epidemic.
Methodologically, our paper advances the use of pre-committed research designs in observational studies. Recent overviews of key developments in empirical methods have emphasized both pre-analysis plans and transparency in research methods (Currie et al., 2020;
Christensen and Miguel, 2018). Christensen and Miguel (2018) note that pre-specified ob5

servational studies are exceedingly rare, but that “it would be desirable in our view for more
prospective observational research to be conducted in a prespecified fashion.”1 To the best
of our knowledge, this paper advances the first pre-analysis plans for asssessing the long-run
effects of major entitlement program reforms.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background on key provisions of the
ACA. Section 3 describes the data we analyze. Section 4 presents our basic empirical methodology. Section 5 presents our estimates of the effects of the ACA’s Medicaid expansions
through 2018. Section 6 lays out the empirical tests we commit to running in future years as
we investigate the ACA’s effects over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent
recovery. In Section 7 we conclude.

Background

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) substantially reshaped the U.S.
insurance landscape. While the ACA was passed and signed into law in March 2010, several
of its most impactful provisions took effect in January 2014.2 These include expansions to
states’ Medicaid programs, subsidies for purchasing non-group coverage, community-rating
regulations, and tax penalties for failure to acquire insurance. An employer-side mandate,
also linked to financial penalties, first took effect in 2015.
The ACA’s Medicaid expansions are the law’s most readily studied component. The
ACA’s Medicaid provisions expanded eligibility to all individuals in households with in1

In the economics literature, the sparse available examples are concentrated in the minimum wage literature. They include an early pre-specified analysis by Neumark (2001), as well as more recent analyses by
Clemens and Strain (2017) and by Neumark and Yen (2020).

comes less than 138 percent of the federal poverty line. As of August 2020, 12 states had
declined to implement Medicaid expansions, while 38 states and the District of Columbia had
moved forward. Among the expansion states, 24 had implemented their Medicaid expansions
as of January 2014. The others moved forward in later years. We present this variation in the
timing of states’ Medicaid expansions in Figure 1. The Congressional Budget Office’s (Elmendorf, 2010) initial forecast estimated that, if implemented nationwide, these expansions
would extend coverage to roughly 16 million individuals as of 2018.
The ACA’s other primary tool of coverage expansion is its subsidies for the purchase of
insurance in the individual marketplace (i.e., the “insurance exchanges”). These provisions
are also substantial. The Congressional Budget Office’s (Elmendorf, 2010) initial forecast
estimated that these subsides, coupled with regulation of the individual market, would extend
coverage to roughly 23 million individuals as of 2018. This element of the ACA is more
difficult to study than the Medicaid expansion due to the national level of its implementation.
The subsidies do, however, have a steep income gradient. For individuals with incomes just
above the poverty line, subsidies for purchasing a so-called “Silver” plan exceed 80 percent of
such a plan’s full premium in many geographic markets. The subsidies phase out as incomes
rise to 400 percent of the poverty line. This income gradient creates substantial variations
in the ACA’s impacts across geographic areas, demographic groups, and industries.
Like the exchange subsidies, the ACA’s individual and employer mandates were also implemented nationally. The individual-level mandate was implemented in 2014. The penalties
associated with the mandate rose in magnitude from 2014 through 2016. The mandate was
repealed as of 2019, however, through the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The employer mandate took effect in 2015 and, in contrast with the individual mandate, has not been repealed.
7

The employer mandate’s rules are complex and its implementation somewhat opaque. Its key
feature is that substantial penalties apply to large firms whose employees make use of the
law’s subsidies and who have not offered their employees an insurance benefit that qualifies
as “affordable.”
The national nature of the ACA’s subsidies and mandates make it difficult to study their
effects. Existing studies have made progress by exploiting their differential bite on areas with
low levels of coverage at baseline (Courtemanche et al., 2017, 2018b; Duggan et al., 2019;
Frean et al., 2017). As detailed below, we follow the approach taken by these past studies.
Further, we add analyses that exploit variations in the ACA’s effects across industries.

Data

The primary data source we use in our analysis is the American Community Survey (ACS).
The ACS is the largest household survey data set with consistent documentation of individuals’ insurance coverage throughout our analysis sample. We pool data from the years 2011
through 2018 and track the relationship between the ACA’s key provisions and 4 distinct
variables that relate to insurance coverage. These include indicator variables for whether an
individual is covered by (i) Medicaid, (ii) employer provided insurance, (iii) other forms of
private insurance, or (iv) for whether the individual is uninsured.
We focus our analysis on sub-groups of the population who are disproportionately likely
to be impacted by the ACA’s Medicaid expansions. Following much of the prior literature
(Courtemanche et al., 2017; Kaestner et al., 2017), the first sub-sample on which we focus
consists of individuals with no more than a high school education. The second sub-sample

8

on which we focus is new to the literature on the ACA’s effects. We add to the literature by
analyzing insurance coverage among individuals employed in industries that had low rates
of employer insurance coverage at baseline (2011-2013). In particular, we focus on industries
in the lowest quartile of the coverage distribution. In Appendix Tables A.1 through A.4, we
document the industries that fall into the lowest (Table A.1) through highest (Table A.1)
quartile of insurance coverage rates in 2011-2013, prior to the implementation of the ACA’s
major provisions. In the lowest quartile of pre-ACA employer insurance coverage (25.0% to
57.5%), we find industries including child day care services, sporting goods, grocery stores,
clothing stores, florists, beer and liquor stores, construction, home health care services, and
warehousing. By contrast, in the upper quartile of coverage (pre-ACA employer insurance
coverage rate of 78.4% to 92.0%), we find public utilities, elementary and secondary education, hospitals, finance and insurance, and scientific research and development.
We use several sets of ACS variables as controls. These include demographic characteristics, such as age and education. We also consider controls for other aspects of the households
in which each individual resides. Finally, we consider macroeconomic and labor market data
that proxy for the overall condition of a state’s labor market. Specifically, we control for
state-level unemployment rates (obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics), log income
per capita (from the Bureau of Economic Analysis), and a median house price index (from
the Federal Housing Finance Agency).
The primary policy variation in our analysis is driven by the ACA. The Kaiser Family
Foundation is our source of data on the dates on which each state enacted an ACA Medicaid
expansion. In some specifications, we use baseline (2013) rates of insurance coverage to
capture a sub-state dimension of the ACA’s potential impact. In these specifications, we
9

follow the approach of Courtemanche et al. (2017, 2018b).
Finally, we are interested in variations driven by the labor market churn associated with
COVID-19. As has been documented by Kahn et al. (2020), COVID-19’s impact on labor
demand exhibits variations both across industries and across states. Variation across industries is of interest in our analysis as a source of substantial labor market churn. However,
variation across states is also a potential threat to our identification strategy, as detailed
below. We thus consider control variables related to state-specific COVID-19 case and death
rates (collected by the New York Times).3

Methodology

We present estimates of the ACA’s effects from standard program evaluation models. The
first is the basic difference-in-differences model described by equation (1).

Yi,s,t = βMedicaid Expansions,t + States α1 + Timet α2
+ Xi,s,t γ + εi,s,t ,

(1)

where i indexes individuals, s indexes states, and t indexes years. Medicaid Expansions,t is
set equal 1 for all state-year combinations during which an ACA Medicaid expansion was in
effect, and equal to 0 otherwise.
Our baseline specification includes state and time fixed effects (the vectors α1 , and α2 ).
The coefficient of interest, β, is therefore a difference-in-differences estimator of the effect of
3

10

Medicaid expansions on the outcome, Y . The fixed effects in equation (1) control for timevarying shocks at the national level as well as baseline differences in outcomes across states.
The identifying assumption is that the outcome of interest would have followed similar trends
across states if not for differences in their Medicaid expansion status.
We further control for a range of other factors (Xi,s,t ) that may have shaped insurance
coverage during the time period covered by our analysis. To control for variation across states
in the evolution of macroeconomic well-being, such as differences in economic recoveries following the Great Recession, we add controls for state-level unemployment rates (obtained
from the BLS), per capita income (from the BEA), and a median house price index (from the
FHFA). These controls are important because incomes and the generosity of employer insurance benefits tend to fluctuate with economic conditions, and the latter may be correlated
with states’ Medicaid expansion decisions.
We also present estimates using the event-study specification described by equation (2).

Yi,s,t,e(s,t) =

X

δe 1{Medicaid Expansion}s,t × 1{Event Year}e(s,t)

e6=−1

+ States α1 + Timet α2 + Xi,s,t γ + εi,s,t .

(2)

Equation (2) differs from equation (1) in terms of the manner in which we specify the policy variation. The subscript e corresponds with “event time,” meaning the number of years
before or after a state implements a Medicaid expansion. In the summation, the omitted interaction between the Medicaid expansion indicator variable and the time dummy variables
corresponds with the year prior to the implementation of a state’s Medicaid expansion (i.e.,

11

the year for which e(s, t) = −1). Each δt can thus be described as a difference-in-differences
style estimate of changes in insurance coverage rates in states that enacted Medicaid expansions relative to those that did not. Each estimate captures a differential change from year
e relative to the omitted time period year e(s, t) = −1.
The event-study specification provides a standard check for the potential relevance of
divergent pre-existing trends. Specifically, we can learn about the presence of divergent preexisting trends by inspecting the estimates of δt for event years preceding the implementation
of Medicaid expansions. It will tend to be reassuring if the pre-implementation δt coefficients
are economically and statistically indistinguishable from 0. The smaller the confidence intervals on these estimates, the stronger the test.
A third specification we estimate uses variation in the ACA’s impact across core-based
statistical areas (CBSAs). The specification was developed by Courtemanche et al. (2017)
and used for additional analysis in Courtemanche et al. (2018a,b). Using the event-study
specification below, the basic idea is to use variation in baseline (2013) uninsured rates at
the level of the CBSA to estimate the effects of the ACA’s nationally implemented provisions:

Yi,a,s,t,e(s,t) =

X

γt Uninsureda,s × 1{Medicaid Expansion}s,t × 1{Event Year}e(s,t)

e6=−1

+ Areaa,s α1 + Timet α2 + Xs,t φ + εi,s,t

12

(3)

In equation (3), a indexes the CBSA and Areaa,s is a set of dummy variables for each
CBSA. As described by Courtemanche et al. (2017), the effects of ACA features other than
the Medicaid expansion are estimated by θt . These are the coefficients on the interaction
between Uninsureda,s and the event-year dummy variables (1{Event Year}e(s,t) ). In states
that enacted Medicaid expansions, the additional effect of the expansion is estimated by γt .
These are the coefficients on the interaction between Uninsureda,s , 1{Medicaid Expansion}s,t ,
and the event-year dummy variables (1{Event Year}e(s,t) ). We follow Courtemanche et al.
(2017) in presenting both the coefficients themselves and linear combinations that capture
the effects of the ACA’s provisions at the mean level of Uninsureda,s , which is 20.5 percent.
Our goal in estimating equation (3) is to identify the causal effects of the ACA’s key
provisions on insurance coverage. As with our estimate of β from equation (1), the key assumption we must make for θt and γt to identify the ACA’s effects has a “parallel trends”
flavor. We must assume that baseline rates of uninsurance are not correlated with differential trends in our outcomes of interest. While we cannot test this assumption directly we
can, once again, conduct two sets of checks. We investigate robustness to the inclusion of
plausibly relevant covariates and we confirm that trends were parallel prior to the ACA’s
implementation.

Results

In this section we discuss our results. In section 5.1 we present time series on the evolution
of key outcomes. In section 5.2 we present estimates of the effects of the ACA’s Medicaid
expansions using the basic difference-in-differences model of equations (1) and (2). In section

13

5.3 we present estimates of equation (3), which attempts to capture the effects of the ACA’s
full set of provisions.

5.1

Time Series Figures

In this section we present time series on the evolution of insurance coverage. We focus on
coverage rates among individuals in groups that were most directly affected by the ACA’s
key provisions. To provide suggestive initial evidence on the impact of the ACA’s Medicaid expansions, we present separate time series for individuals in states that implemented
Medicaid expansions versus those that did not.
Figure 2 is organized as follows. The four panels in the first row present data on insurance coverage among individuals with no more than a high school education. Each panel
corresponds with a different type of insurance coverage. The second row presents data on
insurance coverage among individuals who were employed in industries with relatively low
rates of coverage at baseline.
It is clear that Medicaid coverage did indeed expand far more in states that enacted
Medicaid expansions than in states that did not. Among individuals with no more than
a high school education, Medicaid coverage rose by roughly 7 percentage points between
2013 and 2016; in states that did not expand Medicaid it changed negligibly. We see similar
changes in Medicaid coverage among individuals employed in industries that had insurance
rates in the lowest quartile of the coverage distribution at baseline (measured in 2011-2013).
Differential changes in coverage for individuals employed in industries with high versus
low rates of coverage at baseline may reflect contributions from a broad set of the ACA’s

14

provisions. Among individuals who lacked coverage at baseline, for example, those with the
lowest incomes may be eligible for the ACA’s Medicaid expansions. Many more, who earn
incomes in excess of Medicaid eligibility thresholds, became eligible for subsidized coverage.
Those with higher incomes would face higher penalties for failing to acquire coverage. Finally,
as of 2015 these individuals’ employers would risk incurring penalties if they failed to provide
access to “affordable” coverage, as defined by the ACA.
In panel A of Figure 3, we present four time series on the fraction of individuals with any
source of insurance coverage. The four time series are associated with the four quartiles of
the distribution of workers as divided on the basis of their industries’ baseline (2011-2013)
coverage rates. Coverage gains after 2013 are much larger for individuals in industries that
had lower rates of coverage at baseline. The scatter plot in Panel B shows the correlation
between coverage changes and baseline coverage rates at the level of 4-digit industry codes.
The negative correlation between coverage gains and baseline coverage rates is remarkably
strong.
As presented in Figure 3, we have taken no steps to isolate the relevance of industry
coverage offerings from other factors. That is, the patterns we observe in Figure 3 might
be explained by correlations between industry and worker or locational characteristics that
have been explored in past research on the ACA’s effects. We thus take our analysis of the
ACA’s impact across industries a step further by using a coarsened exact matching (CEM)
procedure.4 We use this procedure as an approach to accounting for the fact that individuals
4

We implement the coarsened exact matching (CEM) procedure described in Iacus et al. (2012) using the
Stata package developed by Blackwell et al. (2009). This procedure increases balance between our samples
of individuals in industries with high baseline coverage rates relative to those in industries with low baseline coverage rates. Among the low baseline coverage industries, individuals with high education and high
income are less common. The CEM procedure up-weights individuals with less common characteristics. We
create CEM weights to match both high early coverage to low early coverage and low early coverage to high

15

in industries with low baseline coverage rates also tend, on average, to have lower levels of
education and lower levels of earnings than those in industries with high baseline coverage
rates. Because there is substantial variation in both coverage and demographic characteristics
across those employed in various industries, we can reweight samples to match “high” and
“low” baseline coverage industries on these other characteristics.
In addition to presenting results that reweight by demographic characteristics, we present
results that reweight by demographics plus average industry earnings, and by demographics plus average industry earnings plus geographic differences in baseline coverage rates.
We do this so that our reweightings incorporate the primary demographic and geographic
dimensions along which past work has analyzed heterogeneity in the ACA’s effects.
In Figure 4, we present time series that have been reweighted using the exact coarsened
matching procedure. In panels A and D of Figure 4, we reweight to account for education
levels, average weeks of work, average hours worked per week, and annual income. In panels
B and E, we add industry earnings to the set of characteristics on which we match. In panels
C and F, we add geographic variations in baseline (2013) uninsured rates measured at the
CBSA level. In panels A, B, and C, we re-weight the characteristics of individuals in the
top quartile of the industry-specific insurance coverage distribution to match those in the
bottom quartile. In panels D, E, and F we re-weight individuals in the bottom quartile
early coverage. Our first CEM procedure matches on 4 individual-level dimensions, namely personal income,
education, weeks worked last year, and hours per week worked last year. We also provide estimates where we
match on a 5th dimension, average industry earnings, as well as a 6th dimension, geographic variations in
uninsured rates prior to the implementation of the ACA’s Medicaid expansions and exchange subsidies. The
patterns of weights associated with our 4-dimensional, 5-dimensional, and 6-dimensional CEM re-weightings
are presented in tables A.6, A.7, and A.8, respectively. In each of these tables, Panel I illustrates how individuals with relatively high socioeconomic status (e.g., high incomes and high levels of education) are assigned
low weights when reweighting the high baseline coverage sample to look more like the low baseline coverage
sample. Conversely, Panel II of each table illustrates how individuals with relatively high socioeconomic
status are assigned high weights when reweighting the low baseline coverage sample to look more like the

of the industry-specific insurance coverage distribution to match those in the top quartile.
The figures are strongly suggestive that the ACA’s full set of provisions had substantially
larger effects on industries with low baseline coverage rates than on those with high baseline
coverage rates. Reweighting with respect to demographic differences, differences in industry
earnings, and geographic differences in baseline coverage rates has only a modest impact
on the size of the differential coverage gains for individuals in industries with low rates of
coverage at baseline.
Across Figures 2, 3, and 4, it is apparent that overall rates of insurance coverage rose
substantially during our sample period. In our low-education samples, the fraction without insurance declined by roughly 9 percentage points averaged across the expansion and
non-expansion states. In our sample selected on the basis of industry, the fraction without
insurance also declined by an average of roughly 9 percentage points.
Finally, while coverage gains through Medicaid expansions were partially offset through
other sources of coverage, overall coverage gains were greater in expansion states relative to
non-expansion states. In both of the samples we analyze, the fraction uninsured declined by
roughly 4 percentage points more in states that expanded their Medicaid programs. Also
in both samples, this 4 percentage point relative gain is roughly half the magnitude of the
relative increase in Medicaid coverage. This primarily reflects the fact that individuals in
states that did not expand Medicaid were moderately more likely to obtain coverage with
the assistance of subsidies through the ACA’s exchanges.

Estimates of the Effects of the ACA’s Medicaid Expansions
on Insurance Coverage Through 2018

In this section we present estimates of the effects of the ACA’s Medicaid expansions using the
basic difference-in-differences models of equations (1) and (2). Figure 5 presents estimates
of equation (2). The panels are organized in the same order as the panels of Figure 2.
The estimates in Figure 5 are in line with what one would tend to predict by looking
at the time series in Figure 2. Among those with no more than a high school education,
Medicaid expansions generated an additional 4 to 5 percentage point decline in the fraction
uninsured within 3 years of the expansion’s implementation. The equivalent figure for those
employed in industries with low baseline coverage rates is just under 4 percentage points. As
in the time series figures, these declines are driven by relative increases in Medicaid coverage
that are on the order of 8 percentage points, coupled with moderate offsets in coverage
through employers or through subsidized exchange coverage. The exchange coverage offset
is relatively modest for the sample selected on the basis of education. This is related to the
fact that a non-trivial fraction of the individuals in this sample are not employed, and thus
do not have incomes sufficiently high to qualify for subsidies on the exchanges. Among the
individuals employed in industries with low baseline coverage rates, by contrast, the vast
majority have incomes that make them eligible for subsidies. In all cases, we find that the
effects of the Medicaid expansions stabilize around two years after enactment (2016 for most
Medicaid expansion states).
An examination of event-study analyses for those with a college education or more (Appendix Figure A.5, Panel I) and employed in industries in the highest quartile of baseline

18

insurance coverage (Panel II) reflect much smaller impacts of state Medicaid expansions for
these groups. This is expected, as individuals with higher education and working in industries with higher baseline coverage rates are far less likely to live in households with incomes
less than 138 percent of the Federal poverty line. Notably, the effects that we detect for
individuals with a college education or more are in line with what we would expect given
the poverty rates of such individuals. For example, for those with a college degree or more,
the poverty rate according to 2018 census data was 4.4 percent, while the estimated effect
of the Medicaid expansion is approximately 2 percentage points. This is roughly the same
ratio we find for those with a high school education or less, who have a poverty rate of 16.1
percent and for whom the estimated effect of Medicaid expansion on Medicaid coverage was
roughly 8 percentage points.
Tables 2 and 3 present estimates of equation (1), which summarize the effects of states’
Medicaid expansions in a single coefficient. The estimates are as one would expect based on
Figures 2 and 3. For both the low education and low baseline coverage samples, Medicaid
expansions generate a 7 percentage point gain in Medicaid coverage and a 2.5 to 4 percentage
point decline in the fraction uninsured, depending on the sample and precise specification.
The columns of each table reveal that these results are quite robust to whether the specifications include controls for the demographic characteristics of the individuals in the sample
and proxies for variations in states’ economic conditions. We find no evidence that these results are contaminated by sample selection bias, as state Medicaid expansions are not found
to be systematically related to education, employment, or baseline (2013) industry-specific
insurance coverage rates (see Appendix Table A.5).
Table 4 presents additional evidence on the relevance of industries’ baseline coverage
19

rates. In contrast with our earlier evidence on variations in coverage gains across industries,
the analysis in Table 4 focuses on the effects of Medicaid expansions rather than on the
effects of the ACA as a whole. All estimates in the table are of equation (1). Panels A and B
contrast the effects of ACA Medicaid expansions on individuals in industries with low baseline
coverage rates (panel A) to those in industries with high baseline coverage rates (panel B).
Comparisons of column 1 to columns 2 through 4 reveal the extent to which estimates
are sensitive to reweighting the samples using the coarsened exact matching procedures
discussed in sub-section 5.1. In each instance, we reweight the sample of individuals from
high baseline coverage industries to more closely resemble the sample from low baseline
coverage industries.5 Note that as we move from columns (1) through (4), the number of
observations for each regression falls as we apply CEM weights to assure common support.
Few observations are lost as we move from column 1 to column 2. This reflects the fact
that, on key individual-level covariates, individuals employed in industries with low versus
high baseline coverage rates share nearly complete common support. The sample declines
considerably when moving from column 2 to column 3. This reflects the fact that average,
industry-wide earnings is our primary matching variable along which individuals employed
in industries with low versus high baseline coverage rates lack widespread common support.
The estimates in Table 4 reveal that Medicaid expansions had greater effects on individ5

For our analysis of Medicaid expansions, reweighting the sample of individuals from high baseline
coverage industries to more closely resemble the sample from low baseline coverage industries is the only
direction in which reweighting makes sense. The reason for this is that individuals with middle or high
levels of income are ineligible for Medicaid whether a state expanded Medicaid or not. Because the vast
majority of individuals in industries with high baseline coverage rates have middle or high levels of income,
reweighting the low baseline coverage sample yields a sample that, on a weighted basis, is largely ineligible
for the program under analysis. By contrast, reweighting the high baseline coverage sample yields a sample
with more potential exposure to Medicaid expansions. This allows us to answer the question of interest: do
individuals with similarly high levels of potential eligibility, as determined primarily by income, experience
weaker effects of Medicaid expansion if they are employed in an industry that had a high rate of employer
coverage at baseline?

20

uals in industries with low rates of coverage at baseline relative to those in industries with
high rates of coverage at baseline. Within the table, the most consistent and most important
finding pertains to overall coverage. Whether we apply our reweighting methodolologies or
not, we find that Medicaid expansions led overall coverage to rise just over two percentage
points more among individuals in industries with low baseline coverage rates than among
individuals in industries with high baseline coverage rates. When we apply no reweighting,
the estimated effects of Medicaid expansions are a 3.3 percentage point gain in coverage
for those in low baseline coverage industries and a 0.5 percentage point gain in coverage
for those in high baseline coverage industries. The differential gain is thus 2.8 percentage
points. When we apply our most extensive reweighting (column 4), the estimated effects are
a 2.2 percentage point gain in coverage for those in low baseline coverage industries and
a 0.2 percentage point gain in coverage for those in high baseline coverage industries. The
differential gain is thus 2.0 percentage points.
What sources of coverage account for the differential effect of Medicaid expansions on
individuals in industries with low rates of coverage at baseline relative to those in industries
with high rates of coverage at baseline? Our estimates uniformly suggest that Medicaid coverage per se is an important source of the differential gain. The increase in Medicaid coverage
for those in low baseline coverage industries exceeds the increase in Medicaid coverage for
those in industries with high baseline coverage by at least 1 percentage point in each of our
specifications. The evidence is mixed on whether there are additional contributions from
other sources of coverage. While there is clearly a role for coverage through Medicaid per se,
the evidence does not support taking a strong stand on the full set of sources underlying the
overall differential coverage gains.
21

The findings in Table 4 represent an important contribution to the existing literature by
documenting a new dimension along which the ACA had heterogeneous bite. Our analysis
thus far has shown that individuals in industries with low rates of coverage at baseline benefited disproportionately from both Medicaid expansions and from the full set of provisions
in the Affordable Care Act. Our reweighting procedures ensure that these results are not
driven by a broad set of individuals’ observable economic and demographic characteristics.
This includes their income, education, weeks worked last year, hours per week worked last
year, average earnings in their industry of employment, and geographic differences in baseline
coverage rates. The analysis thus shows that baseline coverage in an individual’s industry
of employment is a novel, empirically relevant dimension of the ACA’s impacts. That is, it
is a dimension not captured by prior analyses of heterogeneity in the ACA’s impacts across
geographic areas and across socioeconomic groups.

5.3

Estimates of the Overall Effects of the ACA’s Through 2018

In this section, we present estimates of equation (3), which attempts to capture the effects of
the ACA’s full set of provisions. As discussed in section 4, estimates of equation (3) capture
variations in coverage gains both across states and within states. Estimates of variations in
within-state coverage gains are generated using variations in the ACA’s potential impact
across commuting areas. As shown in Table 5, the estimates suggest that both the ACA’s
Medicaid expansions and other provisions had substantial impacts on coverage.
The interpretation of the estimates in Table 5 is somewhat subtle. Consider the estimates
in rows 2 and 3 of column 3. The estimate in row 2 implies that in states that did not im-

22

plement Medicaid expansions, a 10 percentage point lower baseline coverage rate predicts
a 1.55 percentage point larger coverage gain after the ACA’s key provisions went into effect. The estimate in row 3 implies that this differential coverage gain was an additional 2.9
percentage points larger in states that enacted Medicaid expansions. One way to interpret
these estimates is to say that implementation of the full ACA (including the Medicaid expansions) reduced baseline differentials in the fraction uninsured by roughly 44 percent (0.15
plus 0.29). The entries in panel B convert the estimates from panel A into percentage point
gains in coverage estimated at the mean level of the baseline fraction uninsured. Estimated
at this mean of 20.3 percent, the gain in non-expanding states was roughly 3 percentage
points while the gain in expanding states was roughly 9 percentage points.
The estimates in Table 5 are subject to more identification threats than our earlier
estimates. In particular, it is crucial to make use of event-study estimators to check whether
areas with relatively low baseline coverage rates were experiencing more rapid coverage
gains prior to the implementation of the ACA’s key provisions. The event-study estimates,
as presented in Figures 11 and 12, reveal that this was not the case. This is consistent with
the analysis of Courtemanche et al. (2017, 2018a,b) in support of this estimation framework.

6

Pre-Analysis Plan

In this section, we lay out our pre-analysis plan, including the specific hypotheses we propose to test. Our pre-committed analyses will occur within the “event-study” estimation
frameworks described by equations (2) and (3). In one sense, the analysis is straightforward,
as it involves updating estimates that dynamically track the effects of the ACA’s provisions

23

over time. Within this structure, our pre-committed analyses relate to specific, empirically
testable hypotheses.
Our hypotheses involve key dimensions of the ACA’s benefits and costs. With respect to
the ACA’s benefits, we hypothesize that low-education individuals and those last employed in
low-coverage industries will experience smaller increases in their probability of being uninsured during the pandemic if they live in states that enacted ACA Medicaid expansions.
With respect to the ACA’s costs, we hypothesize that, in COVID-19’s wake, low-education
individuals and those employed in low-coverage industries will become less likely to have
employer provided insurance in states that enacted Medicaid expansions than in those that
did not. We further hypothesize that these effects will be particularly large in industries and
geographic areas that are disproportionately impacted by both COVID-19 and the initial
implementation of the ACA. Finally, while the focus of our analysis is on the long-run effects of the ACA on insurance coverage, in our pre-committed analysis we extend our set of
outcomes to include employment.
Figures 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 illustrate our key hypotheses. For ease of exposition, we
limit the samples underlying these figures to states that never expanded their Medicaid programs and states that implemented Medicaid expansions in 2014. Because the “treatment”
states in these samples implemented their Medicaid expansions during the same year, event
time corresponds perfectly with calendar time. To date, ACS data have only been released
through 2018. Estimates for 2019 through 2022 are thus hypothetical. The hypotheses we
commit to testing involve the equality of coefficients associated with calendar years 2020,
2021, and 2022 relative to calendar years 2018 and 2019. As illustrated in the figures, our key
hypotheses involve additional impacts of Medicaid expansion on coverage for our samples of
24

individuals with no more than a completed high school education or who are employed in
industries with low coverage rates at baseline.
The economic content of our hypotheses relate to the long-run dynamic effects of the
ACA’s key provisions. The key challenge for our pre-committed analyses is that variations
in exposure to the ACA, as captured by our initial analyses, may also be correlated with
variations in exposure to COVID-19. For our purposes, spatial correlation between ACA
exposure and the pandemic’s direct impact are a potential source of bias. Bias could also
result from spatial correlations between ACA exposure and subsequent state-level policy
changes. Designing robustness analyses that will test the relevance of these potential threats
to identification requires applying subject matter knowledge. Importantly, the pandemic
or policy environment may take turns for which it is not possible to pre-specify a fully
satisfactory set of robustness checks. It is thus necessary to pre-specify a measure of discretion
to account for unpredictable developments through additional robustness analyses.
Through September 2020, there were substantial variations in the COVID-19 pandemic’s
direct impacts on population health. Appendix Figure A.1 shows variation across states in
cumulative COVID-19 cases per 100,000 individuals (panel A) and in COVID-19-related
mortality rates (panel B). Spikes in new cases also varied substantially across time (panel C)
with the largest outbreaks occurring in the Northeast coming first (March-April), followed
by the South and Southwest (May-July), and then the Midwest (August-September). These
geographic dimensions of the pandemic are relevant for our purposes because they reveal
the extent to which Medicaid expansion states (Figure 1) are correlated with states hardest
hit by COVID-19 (Appendix Figure A.1). While there is some evidence that states with
the highest cumulative COVID-19 case and mortality rates were less likely to enact ACA
25

Medicaid expansions, there is substantial variation in COVID-19’s bite across both expansion
and non-expansion states.
In Appendix Figure A.2, we show cross-state variation in the peak decline in monthly
employment over the period from January 2020 through August 2020. Again, while those
states that were hardest hit by the COVID-19-related recession were more likely to expand
Medicaid, there is substantial, overlapping variation in employment shocks across expansion
and non-expansion states. In summary, there is sufficient spatial heterogeneity in the depth
of COVID-19’s health and employment shocks in both expansion and non-expansion states
to permit us to disentangle the long-run effects of the ACA from the short-run effects of
COVID-19 per se.
In light of the data discussed above, a key component of our pre-committed analysis is
that we will investigate the robustness of our results to controlling for variations in both
the health and employment impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our controls for the pandemic’s severity will attempt to balance between standard conserves of both “under-“ and
“over-“ controlling. To construct controls for health shocks, we will interact measures of
cumulative cases and cumulative deaths per capita with a sparse set time dummy variables.
More specifically, the time dummy variables will include an indicator for 2020 and a single
indicator for all subsequent years (namely 2021 and 2022). The case count and death rate
variables will be continuous, time varying values corresponding with cumulative per capita
counts as of the end of each calendar year. Controlling for this set of interactions will allow
for the possibility that outbreaks of differing sizes impacted our outcomes of interest and that
this relationship may evolve from 2020 to later years. We will similarly interact measures of
each state’s peak employment decline, in percent terms, the time dummy variables described
26

above. Here again, the resulting control variables will allow for the possibility that outbreakinduced employment declines had impacts that evolved from 2020 through subsequent years.
The strength of the conclusions we can draw will depend in part on the robustness of our
estimates as we introduce control variables along these lines.
A final analysis of interest involves making use of cross-industry variations in the amount
of labor market churn that has resulted from COVID-19. In our pre-committed analyses, we
are interested in understanding the long run effects of the ACA’s key provisions. We define
this to mean the effects as they emerge following a period of substantial churn. Beyond the
overall churn associated with COVID-19, variations in COVID-19’s impacts across industries
may also be informative. Analyzing such variations requires making a subtle distinction
between variations of interest and sources of potential bias.
With respect to COVID-19’s impacts, what constitutes a potential source of bias and what
constitutes a variation of interest for our purposes? As noted above, variations in COVID-19’s
impacts across the geographic areas that constitute our “treatment” and “control” groups
(e.g., states that did vs. did not enact Medicaid expansions), is a potential threat to the
validity of our estimation frameworks. Variations of this sort motivate the control variables
discussed above. Variation in COVID-19’s impact across industries within our treatment and
control groups, however, is of potential interest.
Across lower-paid, lower-coverage industries, there have been substantial variations in the
COVID-19 pandemic’s impacts. The pandemic’s effects on restaurants, hotels, and drinking
establishments, for example, has been remarkably large. The pandemic’s effects on grocery
stores, other essential retail, and retail trade more broadly, by contrast, has been less pronounced. Across the Leisure and Hospitality supersector as a whole, for example, employment
27

declined (as measured using the Current Employment Statistics data) from 16.9 million in
February to 8.5 million in April, or by 50 percent. Across the Retail Trade sector, by contrast, employment declined from 15.6 million in February to 13.3 million in April, or by 15
percent. In Appendix Figure A.3, we show monthly declines in employment for three industry sectors in the lowest quartile of insurance coverage: grocery stores, food service and
drinking places, and leisure and hospitality using data from the Current Employment Statistics survey. We demonstrate that the COVID-19 epidemic hit the food service/drinking and
leisure/hospitality sectors much harder than grocery stores, as the latter were classified as
essential businesses during COVID-19-related shutdowns. During the recovery from COVID19, it will thus of interest to compare the effects of Medicaid expansions on employees in the
Leisure and Hospitality sector relative to employees in industries that have similar earnings
profiles, but that experienced less severe disruption from COVID-19.
Our approach to analyzing the implications of variations in churn across industries will
begin with the event-study specifications described by equations (2) and (3). Specifically, we
will estimate equations (2) and (3) separately on each 3-digit and 4-digit NAICS industry
code. For each industry, we will then calculate the change in the estimated impact of the
ACA’s Medicaid expansions (equation (2)) or of all ACA provisions (equation (3)) between
2019 and later years. We will then investigate how these estimates of the additional, longrun effects of the ACA’s provisions relate to the amount of churn each industry experienced
due to the pandemic. Our estimates of the amount of industry-specific churn will make use
of high quality employment counts from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.
In comparing industries that experienced different degrees of churn, it will be important to
either control for or match on each industry’s average earnings so that our estimates are not
28

contaminated by cross-industry variations in workers’ exposure to the ACA’s key provisions.
The uncertainties facing the design of this final piece of analysis are substantial. While it
is presently possible to sketch an analysis plan with the above level of detail, we anticipate
that this last piece of analysis may encounter hurdles that it is difficult for us to anticipate.
This portion of our long-run study may thus require more discretion than our relatively
straightforward updates to the event-study frameworks that are familiar from the existing
literature on the ACA’s effects.

Conclusions

Our analysis in this paper has pursued two objectives. First, we have updated and expanded
on existing analyses of the short- to medium-run effects of the ACA’s key provisions on
insurance coverage. This analysis yields two findings. In the context of the early-to-mid2010s economic expansion, we find that the ACA’s impacts on insurance markets had largely
stabilized as of 2016. Estimated effects evolved quite modestly over subsequent years. Our
second finding is that the ACA had significantly heterogeneous effects across industries.
Specifically, we show that the ACA had greater effects on individuals employed in industries
with low rates of employer coverage at baseline. Further, we use a coarsened exact matching
procedure to show that this finding cannot be explained by observable differences in the
income, education, or other key characteristics of these industries’ employees relative to the
employees of industries with higher baseline coverage rates. We thus provide novel evidence
that the ACA can be interpreted as filling gaps in the pre-existing landscape of employerdriven coverage.

29

Second, we lay the groundwork for pre-committed analyses of the ACA’s long-run effects. The COVID-19 pandemic creates circumstances that are perhaps uniquely suitable for
designing pre-committed analyses of the “long-run” effects of the ACA’s key provisions. Because the COVID-19 pandemic has severed employment relationships on an unprecedented
scale, it will provide evidence on the ACA’s capacity to help those who lose jobs to maintain insurance coverage. The post-pandemic recovery will provide additional evidence on the
ACA’s effects on both employment and employer coverage following a period of substantial
churn.
Through our development of a pre-analysis plan, we seek to make progress in the development of pre-committed research designs in non-experimental contexts. Pre-commitment
plans have the methodological benefit of increasing transparency and reducing the threat
of specification search (Christensen and Miguel, 2018). We highlight that pre-committed
research designs may be particularly feasible and valuable for long-run analyses. Their feasibility arises out of the possibility of pre-specifying the extension of event-study designs that,
given recent trends in research methods (Currie et al., 2020), researchers are likely to carry
out for short- and medium-run analyses. The value of such efforts may be high, as the threat
of specification search becomes increasingly worrisome in analyses of long-run effects.

rates. In each panel, a coarsened exact matching procedure has been applied to match reweight samples for the first and fourth quartiles so that they match on selected economic
and demographic characteristics. The matching procedure is described in the text in section 5.1. In Panel I, observations from the highest quartile are reweighted to match
observations in the lowest quartile. In Panel II, observations from the lowest quartile are reweighted to match observations in the highest quartile. All weighting procedures
match on income, education, weeks worked last year, and hours per week worked last year. CEM 5 and 6 also match on and average industry earnings. CEM 6 also matches on
geographic variations in baseline uninsurance rate.

squares estimates generated using data from the 2011-2018 American Community Survey. Standard errors are
clustered at the state level. Demographic controls include indicators for non-Hispanic white, black, Hispanic,
female, and educational attainment (less than high school, high school degree, some college, and college degree).
Economic controls include state-level per-capita income, unemployment rate, and housing price index. The
estimates in this table are the primary coefficients of interest from equation (3), as described in detail in the
main text. Low pre-treatment coverage industries are defined as industries in the bottom quartile of mean
employer-sponsored health insurance coverage rates between 2011 and 2013

N otes: This table provides means of matching variables by weight bin. The weights summarised in this table were constructed using the CEM matching
procedure as described in the text in section 5.1. Columns 1 through 4 show descriptive statistics for individuals that received weight less than one while
columns 6 through 9 show descriptive statistics for individuals that received weight greater than one. Column 5 shows descriptive statistics for individuals
with high early coverage (panel I) or individuals with low early coverage (panel II). The 6 dimensions used for creating the CEM weights summarised in
this table are hours worked per week last year, weeks worked last year, personal income, years of schooling, average industry earnings, local area insurance
rate.
