SHIRKING OR PRODUCTIVE SCHMOOZING:

WAGES

AND THE ALLOCATION OF TIME AT WORK

ABSTRACT

Major strands of recent macroeconomic theory hinge on the relation of

workers' efforts to their wages, but there has been no direct general evidence
on

this relation. This study uses data from household surveys for 1975 and

1981

that include detailed time diaries to examine how changes in the use of time on

the job affect wages. Additional time spent by the average worker relaxing at
work has no impact on earnings (and is presumably unproductive). Additional on-

the-job leisure does raise earnings of workers whose break time is very short.
Only among union workers •

for whom additional leisure time (in unscheduled

breaks only) appears productive, does this pattern differ. The results suggest
that further growth in on-the-job leisure will reduce productivity (output per

hour paid-for), that monitoring workers can yield returns to the firm, but that
entirely eliminating breaks is counterproductive.

I. Introduction
Since World War II there has been a rapid increase in two types of leisure

that may affect workers' productivity while they are actually working. The
first of these is the well-known increase in paid time

vacations,

off

from work - - -

holidays and sick days. In larger manufacturing firms (U.S. Chamber

of Commerce, 1953. 1987) this type of payment for not working increased from 5.4

percent of total payroll cost in 1953 to 10.2 percent in 1986. (Comparable
figures for paid holidays and sick time alone are 2.1 and 4.4 percent.) The
less well-known source of increase is the rise in time spent at work but not

working. In the same survey this source of paid on-the-job leisure increased
from 2.1 to 3.3 percent of payroll costs.
In Hamermesh (1986) I analyzed workers' demand for mixing work with

leisure on the job and paid leisure off the job. However, no one has examined
how on-the-job leisure affects production or the demand side of the labor market.1
Time spent on the job relaxing (loafing?) can increase workers' productivity by

enabling them to rest when they are physically or mentally fatigued. To the
extent that this productivity-enhancing effect exists, it has implications for

issues of interest to labor economists and economists generally. First, and
simplest,

how does

allocation

of time

the structure of pay differ along the dimension of the

at work?

That is, do we observe pay differences that are

related to the amount of time

workers spend on

scheduled and unscheduled breaks?

Of particular recent interest to macroeconomists and labor economists too
has been the role of shirking on the job and the incentives shirking gives

employers to institute monitoring schemes. This question also speaks, though
less directly, to the issue of efficiency wages. Yet in the burgeoning
literature on the role of wage differentials in affecting worker productivity
the evidence supporting the hypothesis is the documentation of interf iris wage
1

differentials unexplained by conventional human capital, demographic and other
variables (Krueger-Suz.ners, 1988). The hypothesis is based on how time is used

in the work place; but no evidence on time use is provided. This is the first
comprehensive study to relate time use to wages.

Alternative uses of time on the job also affect predictions about the

impacts of various labor-market policies. Legislated reductions in the standard
workweek will affect the relative demand for workers and hours differently
depending on the current productivity of slack time in the work place (see Hart,

1987. p. 53). The more productive slack time is, the smaller is the margin
available to employers for increasing the efficiency of hours paid for in
response to an imposed change in standard hours. Increases in wage rates, be
they legislated or bargained, are more costly to employers, and will have a
greater disemployment effect, the lower the productivity of time on the Job.

Understanding the effects of on-the-job leisure on productivity informs us about
the structure of the demand for workers and thus about the possible impacts of
such policies as overtime pay requirements, payroll taxes, and minimum wages.

In Section II I review the work of industrial engineers and psychologists
on the effects of alternative uses of time

II. Background and Theory
As far back as Florence (1924) industrial engineers have charted the paths
of output, spoilage and other indicators of physical productivity as functions
of the length of time the employee has been producing during the day. The
evidence suggests that accident rates and work spoilage are lowest after breaks

and at

the

start of a shift, and that output is highest at those times. A huge

literature in industrial psychology (see McCormick-Ilgen, 1985, for a suimsary)

has

examined

other

the effects of rest periods

on

the job on fatigue,

boredom and

counterproductive reactions. Among workers engaged in physical tasks

there is clear physiological evidence of reductions in work capacity occurring
at lover levels of rest and break time. Among workers in sedentary jobs no such
physiological

evidence exists. Those workers do, however, report feelings of

fatigue when deprived of rest periods, and the literature indicates that there
are psychological benefits from rest periods that may enhance the well-being of
these workers and hence their productivity.

This evidence is

clearly important; but its implications for labor-market

are not entirely clear. What is required is some consideration of how

use on the job

affects the rewards - -

higher wages - - - that are the returns

to productive uses of time on the job. Unless worker productivity is independent
of the way time is used on the job, the phenomena must be modelled as being
jointly determined by workers and employers.
Consider
and

first a simple model

of the choice of hours of productive work

wages in a world of homogeneous workers and a representive firm among those

where leisure on the job is possible. The firm operates in a competitive product

market. I ignore shirking/monitoring in this simple

Let production Y

Y(I1, b(H -

where H is normal (non-break) hours per worker, bsl is a parameter indicating
the productivity of on-the-job leisure, and H is the fixed amount of hours paid

for in the firm. I make the assumptions that Y1(x,x) >

Y(x,x)

0, i.e.,

that the marginal minute of work is uniformly more productive than the same

marginal minute of on-the-job leisure. Normalizing the product price at one,
and assuming that the firm has already decided how many workers to employ, I
assume it maximizes (Y -

WHI subject

to:

U(WIf, H-He) U(f, 0)
where U is the representative worker's utility function, U is the wage the firm
pays, and 1* is earnings available in jobs where no on-the-job leisure is

possible. The maximization process yields solutions for wages and on-the-job
leisure:

U — F'(b,
H,, —

H, I');

F2(b, H, i.').

Depending on preferences and the sizes of Y1

and Y2,

the jointly-maximizing

value of H,, can be less than H.
The comparative-static question of interest here is the effect of an
increase in b, the productivity of on-the-job leisure, on the equilibrium values
of U and H,,. One can show that an increase in b lowers both U and H,, given a

fixed H. Essentially, a higher b encourages the firm to substitute on-the-job
leisure for normal work, and it can still attract workers at a lower wage rate

because the workers are more than willing to trade off reduced normal work for
increased on-the-job leisure.

This model yields little that is testable, as we cannot observe b to link
it to combinations of

and

fl,,.

It

does, though, provide the basis for

analyzing a more useful model, one characterizing an economy with heterogeneous

The firm uses its resources to monitor workers and improve its probability

The competitive pressures are especially increased among firms that had already

those firms. (In the extreme, at a firm in which H,, — H*, a small increase in

A simple way to see this result is to abandon our obsession with labor
supply and assume

that

workers are indifferent between time spent at work in

alternative uses, be they productive or just loafing. In that case the market

locus in

Figure 1 would slope upward solely because employers who use

They

can remain

in business only by paying lower

wages than other employers. If on-the-job loafing becomes more productive.
competition will pressure them to raise wages. In the extreme case, in which we
continue the assumption that workers are indifferent among uses of time on the

job, but assume that all time uses are equally productive, the market locus in

Figure

1

becomes horizontal.

This observation on the possible effects of productive on-the-job leisure

in an implicit market gives a specific prediction: The more productive is onthe-job leisure, the flatter will be the market locus relating the wage rate

to

hours actually worked, holding total hours on the job constant. This means that
the market locus relating wage rates and on-the-job leisure will also be flatter,
other things (including total hours) equal, the more productive is on-the-job

leisure. In the next Section I discuss ways of implementing these observations.

III. Data and Estimating Equations
The model to be estimated is of the standard form:

in W —

(4)

0(1,

T)

where X is a vector of control variables, and T is a vector of variables that
measure alternative uses of time on the job, including H,, and H1. It is easier

to estimate some of the versions of (4) by entering the time spent in each
alternative use separately than by including total time

on the

job and the

spent on breaks. This requires a slight reinterpretation of the results
in Section II, since total hours at work are not held constant. At the extreme,
fraction

in which

on-the-job leisure is as productive as normal working time (is identical

to it from the employer's standpoint), demand forces alone would make the slopes
of both loci the same (and positive

if workers

dislike spending more time on the

job). However, if marginal workers find on-the-job leisure less unattractive
than normal working time, we will still observe a higher positive slope for the
wage- -working time market

locus

than for the wage- -on-the-job leisure market

locus. The discussion in Section II

tastes for normal work

suggested that, for a given distribution of

and on-the-job leisure, higher productivity of the latter

will cause 3lnW/8H1 to approach alnw/aIç.2 In the extreme case, if workers'
distastes for time on the job are distributed independently of how that time is
used, the estimated differences in these slopes will be perfect measures of the
relative productivity of on-the-job leisure and normal working time. If the

interpret that result as reflecting the different relative productivity of the two
activities, different relative tastes for the two activities, or some combination

of both. In interpreting the results I shall make the extreme assumption that
workers find time spent at work equally distasteful regardless of whether it is

spent in normal work activity or in on-the-job leisure. This is not necessarily
correct, but I leave it

The empirical examination of time use on the job is conducted on data from
the

(Juster etal, 1979) and from the 1975-81 Time

Are the data on break times reasonable? Consider first their means. The
total weekly break time, 214 minutes for employees, seems at first glance to be
disturbingly low (less than 45 minutes per working day for the average employee).

It is quite comparable, thougt, with other available data. The Chamber of
Commerce survey (1987, Table 4)

of

larger firms shows that only 3.4

percent

of

costs are accounted for by lunch, coffee and other paid breaks. Assuming

payroll

a forty-hour week, this means those paid breaks totalled only 82 minutes per

week. Even if only half
by

of the 168 minutes of coffee and

lunch

breaks reported

employees in our sample are paid for, we may conclude that the Time Use Study

does not understate break time.
Now

consider the variability of break time across the days on which the

workers kept diaries. (Remember that the typical respondent kept time diaries
for two work days.) The average correlation between time on coffee breaks within
a

pair of diary days was .32 for the sample of 343 workers. For lunch breaks it

was

.27,

and

for

the less structured other breaks it was .16. These correlations

are significant, suggesting the data are not just noise. That the correlation
is lower for other breaks is consistent with their less formal nature.
The differences in diary times between workers in the largest subsample

aM the sample consisting of employees only are striking. Self-employed workers,

excluded from the second subsample, reported 2685 minutes of normal work, but
only

117 minutes of break time.

Self-employed

workers, who presumably determine

their own break time to maximize productivity, spend only half as much time
breaks

on

as employees, and they do this during a longer workweek.

The demographic characteristics on which Table I provides information (and
others not shown) suggest the subsamples are quite typical along most dimensions.
The workers' average age and educational attainment are rougi1y what one

12

observes

for steady workers in subsamples from other large micro data sets. Employees in
this subsample are unionized at roughly the same rate as were all nonfarm
employees in 1976 (see Hainensesh-Rees, 1988. P. 247). Along the dimensions of
the other control variables too, members of this subsample are representative of
household heads in the mid-1970s.
In Table 2 I show the parameter estimates of (4) for the various subsamples.

other characteristics of the workers accord with

found in earnings regressions on other sets of data.'

The effects of

working time on earnings are positive and usually significant. For the

entire subsample an additional hour of normal working time in a typical week

raises earnings by .71 percent. Thus the marginal benefit from additional normal
work is positive, though it is well below the average wage in this subsample.

For none of the three types of breaks is the marginal effect of additional

time significantly positive in the three main subsamples. Indeed, in the leaststructured category of self-reported break time -- - other breaks - - - the marginal
impact is negative and almost significant at conventional levels. From the
results in Table 2 one would infer that time spent at work but not working is

it has no impact on monthly earnings. This would

that, to the extent that

breaks

are not contractual (explicit or implicit)

benefits, it pays employers to spend resources on monitoring workers to induce
them to shift time

from unproductive breaks to productive normal work.

The results for lunch and coffee breaks are similar for union and nonunion

workers. For other breaks, though, the effects on wages are strikingly and
significantly different. Among nonunion workers the effect is negative:
Additional other breaks reduce monthly pay. Among union workers additional
other breaks raise monthly pay. Given the rigid structuring of union jobs, this

effect should not be too surprising. Unscheduled breaks are the workers'
necessary and productive responses to the rigidity. This view is consistent
with the notion (Stafford-Duncan, 1980a) that higher union wages are in part a

compensating differential for the structure of work. In the less rigidiy
structured nonunion sector, these unscheduled breaks detract from performance.
These results clearly suggest that OTJ leisure is shirking among nonunion
workers, but may be productive leisure among unionized employees.9
Before accepting these conclusions we should investigate their robustness
in light of the evidence from industrial psychology cited in Section II that
error rates, accidents, etc. improve following breaks in long spells of continual

work. It may be that a few short breaks throughout the day raise productivity
in nonunion jobs too, even though

not

the

average minute of time spent in breaks is

productive. To investigate this conclusion I reestimated (4) by combining

the three

categories of break time into one, H1, and by adding quadratic terms in

normal working time and break time, and an interaction term between H and H1.1°
The marginal impacts of H,, and H1 on earnings at their minima, means and

maxima are shown in Table 3. While the results are not very strong, they tell a
somewhat different story from that suggested by the estimates in Table 2. Except
for unionized workers • the initial minute of break time, evaluated at the mean

normal working time in the sample, does produce higher earnings (though the

effect is not very significant). Implicitly this mirrors perfectly the results
from industrial psychology on the declines in productivity that come with
continual, uninterrupted work. At the mean break time

an

in

these samples, though,

additional minute of break time has a much smaller positive effect on

productivity; and at the maximum break time in the sample, an additional minute

of break time reduces earnings. Among unionized workers the marginal effect of

breaks on wages is increasing.

This extended investigation suggests that the total abolition of break

time would reduce earnings. However, the results also indicate that additional
break time beyond the average adds nothing to pay. These inferences are
buttressed by our observation that break time is much less among self-employed

workers, but that the self-employed do take some breaks. If we maintain the
assumption that the results reflect differences in productivity between normal

working time and on-the-job leisure, we can infer that, except among unionized

workers, increases in break time will be unproductive. The average minute of
time spent on the job but not in normal work is shirking rather than productive

schmoozing. However, the results also imply that employers act rationally in
not being overly zealous in monitoring workers' activities, for some break time
may be productive (and excessive monitoring could reduce productivity).

B. The Time Use Panel Study, 1975-81
There are several reasons for using panel data to explore further the

relation between pay and time use on the job. Most important, the cross-section
estimates

of

of the previous

worker-firm specific

subsection do not allow us to separate Out the effects

matches and unobserved worker characteristics that may

be correlated with the uses of time. For example, it seems quite reasonable to
expect that workers with strong tastes for on-the-job leisure will sort themselves

into firms that can provide that on-the-job leisure at little cost. We will
then observe a flatter earnings--break-time market locus, holding total hours
constant, than would be estimated if we could control for the characteristics of

the workers and the firms that affect this sorting. Also, the use of a panel of
workers allows us to examine the the stability of patterns of time use on the

job. The cost of using the Panel Study is the reduction in the number of
individuals

included in the

subsamples."

15

In Table 4 I list the means of most of the same variables shown in Table 1.
A comparison of the two tables indicates that the workers included in the
subsample from the Panel Study spent about the same time on the job as did the

average worker in the 1975-76 cross section. The mean amount of time spent in
normal work fell sharply in this subsample between 1975-76 and 1981. and the

amount of break time reported fell proportionately in both samples. While time
on lunch and coffee breaks fell, though, time spent on other breaks rose.
What is most interesting about these data is the large deviation between
time reported in the time diaries as having been spent on the job in 1981 (a
mean of 39.7 hours) and workers' responses about how many hours they worked per

week

(a mean of 43.3 hours). This discrepancy is twice as great as that in the

1975-76 data (both in Table 1 and for 1975-76 for this subsample of the Panel
Study).

Does this change reflect increasing overreporting of hours in CPS-like

data? It is true that the questions on usual weekly hours differed in the two
surveys, with the 1975-76 question referring to the main job at the current

time,

and the 1981 question referring to weekly hours when working in 1980.12

If we restrict the sample to people with only one job, for example, to the 73

employees who held only one job in 1981, the inferences are similar: The
discrepancy between usual hours and

diary reports of total work was 1.9 hours

in 1975-76, but was 3.0 hours in 1981. Another possibility is that economic
conditions differed between 1980 and 1981, so that usual hours reported for 1980

produce a biased comparison to the 1981 diary hours. The CPS data do show that
reported average hours of workers on full-time schedules were 42.8 and 42.4 in

the two years." This .4

decrease is not

sufficient

to explain the increase

the gap between reported and diary hours of 1.1 hours among employees with

only one

job. The only

remaining statistical explanation is that field workers

somehow asked the questions differently in the two

years

The Lagrange Multiplier statistics that test for the presence of individual
effects in the OLS estimators of (4) on the panel data suggest that it makes

sense to worry about computing GLS estimates.16 For the sample of 92 workers
the statistic, distributed y2(l), equals 29.67; for the subsample of employees

the statistic is 32.58. both of these are highly significant, suggesting that
there is a gain to computing GLS estimates in these data.

Estimates based on the panel data, from which our estimating procedure removes
potential biases produced by unobserved individual-specific components of wages,
do not indicate that even a low level of time spent on breaks will increase the
productivity of the average worker.

V. Conclusions and Implicationa
I have found that additional time spent on breaks at work has no effect

on earnings. Employers simply do not pay for increases in time on the job that
is not spent in normal working activities. However, there is some evidence that

time spent on breaks does raise wages: The cross-section results suggest that
the marginal effect of break time on wages is positive among otherwise identical

workers who spend little time on breaks. Moreover, the finding that self-employed
workers do give themselves unscheduled breaks (thougi of much shorter duration
and/or frequency than employees) also suggests that some break time is productive.
tJithin the confines of our key assumption that workers' distastes for time spent

at work are not greatly affected by how that time is spent, the empirical
results support the notion that the marginal minute of break time is unproductive.
For the average worker the results strongly imply that additional time
spent in on-the-job leisure represents shirking rather than productive schmoozing.

This is especially so for nonunion workers. This means that employers have a
substantial incentive to devote resources to monitoring workers' allocations of

time on the job, as time spent on breaks does not add to firms revenues and
does produce costs. To the extent that monitoring can at the margin shift the
time allocations of workers who are paid on a tine-rated basis away from breaks

and toward normal

work,

we can infer that at least some monitoring expenditures

can add to profits. The apparent unproductivity of additional break time also
implies that employers have ample latitude for responding to legislated cuts in

hours or to higher overtime premia by tightening up their supervision
of break time. The existence of this additional margin means that the employment
standard

effects of such legislation are even more complex than standard labor-demand

models suggest. Finally, the results imply that workers who obtain additional
19

OTJ leisure at the expense of normal work time will see their relative pay fall
(since

they would

be substituting unproductive for productive work time). To

the extent that OTJ

leisure

is a normal good, an increase in the variance in

full incomes will, other things equal, lead to a smaller increase in the variance
of observed earnings through this mechanism.

The evidence I have produced is based on cross-section data and does not
speak directly to predicting the effects of the trend toward steady increases in
the fraction of time on the job that is spent in what I have termed mixed leisure
the interspersing of leisure time with normal working time. Indirectly,
though, the evidence suggests that the trend toward increased mixed leisure is

costly in terms of lost output. People may well choose to spend more time at
work in activities that are essentially leisure, but that choice comes at the
cost of slower increases in productivity, and hence in living standards,

than

would otherwise occur. For the typical worker the U.S. economy is now far past
the point where one can argue that additional break time raises productivity.

were less stringent than the ones I have used.

whom were self-employed, reported any working time at home.

questions about weekly hours and totals of time spent at work based on time

8. For examples, in the estimates of (4) over the entire subsample the rate of
return to schooling was 6 percent, the union wage premium was 13 percent, and
workers in the South earned 5 percent less than otherwise identical workers.

The same qualitative conclusions are provided by tests on the subsamples of all
