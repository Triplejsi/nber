THE JOINT RETIREMENT DECISION OF HUSBANDS MD WIVES

ABSTRACT

The objective of the paper is to find empirically whether husbands and
wives tend to retire at the same

time, and

to give an explanation of the

findings. Similarity of retirement dates could be caused by similarity of
tastes (assortative mating), by economic variables, or by the complimentarity

Each explanation would have

different implications for the

response of retirement to policy changes.
Both simple data analysis and economic models of the age of retirement

point to coordination of retirement dates: husbands and wives tend to retire

at the same time. According to the results, very little of the coordination
is due to economic variables, and simple cross-tabulations rule out
assortative

mating as an important explanation. This leaves complimentarity

of leisure. Because of data limitations, this conclusion is, however, mainly

qualitative.
The data

set is the Mew Beneficiary Survey.

1. Introduction
Whereas the retirement behavior of wales has been rather intensively
studied (Boskin and Hurd (1978). Burtchauser(198O).

Mitchell and Fields

(1983,1984). Diamond and Hausman (1984), Ward and Boskin (1984). burtless and
Moffitt (1985). Hausman and Wise (l9BS). Honig and Flanoch (1985),

Custman and

Steinmeier (1986). and Sickles and Taubman (1986)). very little attention has
been paid to the retirement behavior of couples, most likely because in a
self—weighting sample there are not many observations on working women of

retirement age. For example. Fozzebon and Mitchell (1986) use just 139 observations from the Retirement History Survey to study the

retirement behavior of

married women. Because the labor force participation rate of women has grown
substantially over the last 30 years. the retirement behavior of women will
become increasingly important in understanding many issues such as the future
size of the labor force, the number of retirees., and

the aggregate cost of So-

cial Security benefits. Cf particular interest is the joint retirement behavof retirement age

ior of husband and wife, both becaus numerically couples
are more important than single people of retirement age,

and because the joint

retirement decision is much more complex than the decision of an individual.
Most research on the retirement of males finds that the date of retirement
is affected by the level of Social Security benefits, health. mandatory
retirement, and, to a lesser extent, by other aspects of the economic environ-

ment such as the wage rate and assets. For example. Ward and Boskin (1984)
find that the increase in Social Securitybenef its during

the early 1970s pro-

vided a good explanation for the decline in elderly male labor force partici-

pation during that
fect

period.

They further find that bad health has a strong ef-

towards early retirement and that mandatory retirement at age 65 approxi-

mately doubles the probability of complete retirement at age 65. (The indlr

finding another job.) Ilausman and Wise

This

(1985) ob-

line of research generally considers only hus-

bands whose wives are not working, so the issue of the joint choice of retire—

went dates does not arise. Studies of family labor supply, however, typically
find

that

the wife's labor supply is influenced by the husband's wage rate or

by the husband's income. It would not be surprising, therefore, to find that
the

wife's retirement date is influenced by the variables that help determine

the husband's retirement date. Whethn the husband's retirement date is
similarly influenced by the wife's variables is more of an open question.
Although a correlation between husbands' and wives' retirement dates has

yet to be firmly established, there are several kinds of reasons why one might

expect to find such a correlation.t If men who have a particularly strong
taste for goods marry women with similar tastes •

one

would find a positive

correlation between retirement dates, even if retirement dates are not influenced by any economic variables. A correlation could also be caused by

economic variables: for example, both the husbands and wives in families with

substantial assets may tend to retire early, which would induce a postive correlation in dates. A more interesting example is correlation caused by cross—
wage effects. Cross—wage effects could be due to income effects on the.
retirement dates of both husband and wife and/or by compensated cross—wage ef-

fects. The compensated effects result from a utility function in which the
own marginal rate of substitution of goods for leisure is affected by the
leisure of the spouse. One might well imagine such an effect particularly
with respect to. years of retirement: own retirement years may be less

pleasurable if the spouse is working because of constraints put on travelling
and so forth. This kind of reasoning would suggest that husbands' and wives'

3

years of retirement are compliments. so that, cat. Dar., they would desire to
retire at the same time.

This paper has two goals. The first is to give some empirical evidence on
the correlation between retirement dates. Do, in fact, husbands and wives
tend to retire at the sane time, and how strong is the tendency? The results
should provide a baseline for future research. The second goal is to find.
within the constraints of the data, whether observable economic variables contribute to any correlation in retirement dates, and to find evidence of corn—

pensated cross—equation effects,

The

data set is the New Beneficiary Survey. It has

the

advantage of a

substantial number of observations on working husbands and wives of retirement

age. Its main disadvantage is that it is a choice—based cross—section. which

limits the complexity of the analysis that can be undertaken.
The rain findings are that husbands and wives tend to retire at the same

time. Some of the results can be interpreted to mean that their retirement
years are compliments. There is weaker evidence that some of each spouse's
economic variables influence the retirement age of the other, but the findings
are not robust enough to attempt to find compensated effects.

2. Data.
The New Beneficiary Survey (liDS) is a survey of individuals who first

received S.ocial Security benefits in the window." June, 1980 through Hay.

1981 (Maxfield, 1983). The individuals and their spouses were interviewed in
October—December. 1982. Nine catagories

of recipients were

defined. For this

study the important ones are retired male workers and retired female workers,

female workers. A number of

the female workers, in particular, were dually

entitled. Within each catagory sampling rates varied by the age of the
recipient. The sample sizes and sampling rates are as fellows

Although the

a choice—based sample, in a static population it can

be used for analysis provided the proper weighting is used. For example, suppose one wanted to find the probability that an eligible 62 year old would

receive his first benefits at age 63. This is a conditional probability, conditioned on his not having previously received benefits. It is also called
the hazard rate or risk of receiving initial benefits at 63. In a static population the hazard would be the number of 63—year olds in the 1455 divided by

number greater than 62, all weighted by the inverse of the sampling rate.
Even though one does not observe the actual population of 63 year olds exposed

to the risk of benefit receipt, that population can be estimated from the
fractions of older vintages that reached 63 without having received benefits.
However, in a dynamic population this calculation loses accuracy because the

population of 63 year olds at risk is not the sum of the older recipients.
For example, if the population were growing, the population at risk would be

S

under—estimated, so the risk would be over estimated. Similar reasoning applies to the estimation of the response of retirement age to economic vari-

ables. For example, suppose one wants to find how the wage affects the probability of retirement at 63. In a static population one observes the entire
distribution of wages and retirement dates, so that, in principle, the desired

parameter could be estimated. If wages are growing over time, however, the

older

recipients in the MS come from cohorts that had lower wages when they

were 63 than the current 63—year—old recipients. One would associate low

wages with late retirement. Even if the wage bad no effect on retirement, one
would estimate that the retirement hazard at 63 increases in the wage.

In the MS.

tions

the

respondents and their spouses were asked extensive ques-

about their work histories, incomes, assets, wages and

health condition.

From the answers, one can construct their economic environment at the time of

the interview, but not in the years before the interview. This limits the
complexity of the retirement model that can be estimated with the 1135 because

one does not know the alternatives that caused them to continue to work in

earlier years. This is a weakness of the 113$ compared with other data sets

such as the Retirement History Survey. The strength of the 1135 is that it has
a generous number of observations on recently retired husbands and wives.

3. Data Mtalysis.
The goal of this section is to present evidence on whether husbands and
wives tend to retire at the same time. No economic variables will be taken

into account, so the results will simply establish the kinds of behavior that
have to be explained by

that all respondents are at least 63 years old by the time of the survey, and

have

received retired workers' Social Security benefits there is probably

little unretirement. For the results of this section, the

sample is

restricted to couples in which both the husband and wife have a date of leaving the last Job. This eliminates couples in which the wife only worked when
she

was

young because only jobs held after 1950 are recorded. For most of the

results the sample will be further restricted to include only couples in which
both retired after the age of 54, so that the behavior accords more with what

is generally taken to be retirement.
In the reals—worker sample, 1536 couples satisfied these requirements, and

several other minor requirements concerning missing data. The median dif-

ference between the husband's and wife's retirement dates is about 3.8 years.

In that the average age difference is about 3.1 years • this implies that many
husbands and wives retire at about the same age. Table 1 gives the distribu-

tion of the difference between the husband's and wife's retirement dates. In
the male—workers sample, 6.1% of couples retired in the same month; 9.4%

within one month of each other; 11.01 within two months of each other; and
24.6% in the same year. In the female—workers even greater coordination of

retirement dates is found: 8.5% retired within

the same

month. Although it

is not shown in the table • no other concentration of the difference in retire-

ment dates appears. That is, the distribution is flat everywhere except at
differences of a year or less, where there is substantial mass. The table
certainly suggests joint determination of retirement dates.
To find if the coordination ef retirement dates could be induced by the
Social Security system, the distribution was calculated by the retirement age

of the respondent. The idea is that Social Security has different effects at
different ages •

so

the amount of coordination of retirement dates should vary

7

by

age. For example, if eligibility for benefits at age 62 causes both hus-

band and wife to retire at the same time, one

centration

would

expect a greater con-

of the distribution among respondents who retire at 62 than among

respondents who retire at 63 or 64. The table has some suggestion of such an
effect in the female—workers sample, but it is not verified in the male—

workers sample. In fact, no pattern is apparent in both data sets. The table
does not distinguish coordination of retirelent due to economic variables from
coordination caused by coisplimentarity in leisure; but the table would appear
to rule out coordination caused by assortative mating because while assorts—

tive

mating

would induce a correlation between retirement dates, it would not

cause suàh high concentrations within a year.

The remainder of this section will be devoted to other ways of studying

tbe correlation in retirement dates that is suggested by the findings in Table
I. The idea that husbands and wives desire. to retire at the same time will be
called the joint retirement hypothesis.
table 2 shows the probability in the male—worker sample that the wife

retires in a particular age interval as a function of the husband's age at
retirement and of the difference in their ages. For example, among husbands

of the entries

Many

in the table are missing because of sample selection: having

selectedon husband's retirement age and age difference, one cannot observe

8

the fraction of wives that retire at certain ages. Consider1 for example,
husbands who retired at 62 and aro three years older than their wives. At the
time of the survey most of the husbands were 63; their wives were 60. and
some of the wives were still working. One does not know how many will retire

at 62. The table does not extend beyond age differences of 4 and —l because
the number of observations becomes small.

If the joint retirement hypothesis is correct, the wife's retirement probability will vary with the age difference: the wife's retirement probability
should be greatest at the age difference when both husband and wife can retire
at the same time. An example is when the husband's retirement age is 62 and

the wife's retirement age is 55—59. When the age difference is 2, the wife is

60 at the husband's retirement; when the difference is 3, she is 59. One
would expect, therefore, the probability the wife retires at 59 to be greater
when the age difference is 3 than when the age difference is 2, and the table
shows that to be the case. & counter—example is whon the husband's retirement

is 65, the wife's retirement is 63—64, and the age differences are 0 and 1.
One would expect a higher retirement probability to be associated with the

greater age difference, but that is not the case. Only a few similar ;om—
parisons can reliably be made because of missing data or small samples. If

one restricts comparisons to cells in which the husband and wife retire at the
same time and cells adjacent to those, Just five comparisons in which the
probabilities are based on more than 15 observations can be made. Table 3 is

an extract of Table 2; it has comparisons that are based on 10 or more observations. The last column indicates whether the comparison supports the Joint

retirement hypothesis: 6 of the 9 entries show support.

Table 4 has the probability the husband retires classified by the age at
which the wife retires and by the age difference; the probabilities are based

9

on the female—workers data. Seven comparisons of retirement probabilities

similar

to those in Table 3 can be made; six support the joint retirement

hypothesis.

fraction

In total, then, 12 of

16 comparisons support the hypothesis. The

of successful comparisons is different from 1/2 at about the 0.05

significance level.
These kinds of comparisons are not very systematic, and some subjective

judgement is exercised in choosing the cases. Furthermore, one would think

that age differences would shift the entire distribution of retirement ages.
which would change the retirement probabilities at every age. For example

husbands who are four years oldâ than their wives should be less likely to
retire at younger ages than husbands who are the same age as their wives.
Eecause husbands tend to be older than their wives •

many

of the retirement

probabilites are not reliable in the wale—worker data. The rest of the data
analysis, therefore, uses only the female—workers sample. The object of anal-

ysis is the distribution of the husband's retirement age conditional on the
retirement age of the wife. The joint retirement hypothesis implies that as
the age difference increases the probability that the husband retires at an

early age decreases; that is, the entire distribution of retirement ages
shifts towards greater ages.
The retirement distributions, conditional on the wife's retirement age,
are given in Table S. They are found by summing the retirement probabilities
in Table 4. An example where the joint retirement hypothesis is generall3?
supported is found in the column headed 60—61 and the rows labelled 55-42. If

the husband is one year younger than the wife, he would have been 59 or 60

when the wife retired; 602 of such husbands retired before the age of 63. If
the husband is 4 years older than the wife, he would have been 64 or 65 when

at 64 or 65, so that few would retire before 63. The

show that to be the case: just 25% of such husbands retired before the

age of 63. Generally the probability the husband retires should increase with
in each block as one moves down each column. Similar reasoning implies that,

holding constant the difference in age, the retirement probabilities should
decrease as the retirement age of the wife increases. An example is the
retirement probability at 61 or less of husbands who are the same age as their
wives: when the wife retires at 55—59, 41% of the husbands retire before 62;

when the wife retires at 66+, just 6% of the husbands retire before 62.
The entries generally seem to decrease both as the age difference in-

creases and as the wife's retirement age increases. It is desirable, however,
to verify this in a systematic way. One method is to calculate the trends in

the table. Table 6 has the least squares estimates of the trends in the
columns. The interpretation of the entries is the change in the husband's
retirement probability for a change in the age difference. in the example
mentioned before, inwhich the wife retires at 60—61, the probability that the
husband retires before 63 decreases by 0.067 for each year of age difference.

The average of all, the entries in the table is —0.033. This is a simple

measure of the shift in the retirement distributions for an increase in the
age difference. 21 of the 30 entries are negative, which gives additional
support to the joint retirement hypothesis. A roug1 idea of the change in
husband's retirement age for a change in age difference can be calculated from

the entries in Table 6. Taking the retirement ages to be the midpoints of

each interval (with 67 for the upper interval), one finds that a change of a
year in the age difference is associated with an increase in the husband's
retirement age of 0.44 year.

28 of the 30 entries are

negative. The increase in husband's retirement age for an increase in wife's
retirement age is roughLy 0.41. Again, these results are consistent with the
joint retirement hypothesis.

related to the difference in age. For example, if the joint

retirement hypothesis is correct, then husbands and wives who are the same age

tend to retire at the same age; thus, one ought to find that if the age
difference is zero, a high fraction will have the same retirement age. In
Table 8 • 25.8% of husbands and wives of the same age retired at the same age.
will

Similar reasoning suggests that the largest entries in the table should be
along the diagonal: couples with the same difference in age will tend to have

the same difference in retirement age. That is exactly what is found in the

table: the greatest entry in every coltnn is on the diagonal.
4. Models of Retirement Age.
The results above certainly support the view that retirement dates are
correlated, but they give no indication of the source of correlation: joint
retirement could be induced by the economic environment, by taste variation,

or by complimentarity in leisure. For example, it may

be

that wives and hus—

12

bands

tend

to retire at the same time

because

the wife's Social Security

benefit, based on the husband's earnings record, cannot be drawn until the

husband retires. One would then find correlation between retirement dates.
Further cross—classification by levels of economic resources would allow one

roughly to hold constant economic resources, but the counts in the cells would
is to inbecome too small to allow interpretation. A useful way to proceed
troduce a model of retirement behavior. It will control for economic variables in a way dictated by the functional form. The, reader can interpret the
results as an extension of the cross—tabulations or as indicative of behavior.

The vehicle for exploring the

influence

of economic variables on retire-

ment age will be the Stone—Geary utility function. It can quite naturally be
parameterized to include both systematic and random taste variation that are
econometrically identified. The thought experiment that will lie behind the

estimation is as follows: given at age 55
workers

choose the number of additional years to work. From this point of

view, the age of retirement is an object of demand, and an equation that explains the retirement age is a demand equation. Because of the economic environment,

important differences from the usual kinds

that assets and annuities should enter equations (I) as endogenous variables.

not a stock.

female—workers sample have a greater attachment to the labor force than

the wives in the male—workers sample: they retire later; they have higher

wages, higher Social Security benefits and pensions. They are in better

health as a smaller fraction say they have health problems that affect their
jobs. The husbands in the female—workers sample are different from the hus-

bands in the male—workers sample: they retire •arlier; they have lower
wages, fewer assets, smaller Social Security benefits and pensions, and worse

health. The health of the husband is a possible reason for the differences
between the two samples: the wives of husbands with bad health spent more

time in the labor force; the husbands had lower earnings and greater health

expenditures, resulting in lower assets at retirement.
The results from estimating the retirement—age equations (1) over the two

samples can be found in Table 10. The estimates certainly differ across the

two samples. At least partly this is due to large standard errors. According to the Stone—Geary utility function, the error terms have heteros—

cedasticity as well as cross—equation correlation. This was not corrected in
the estimation as .later results suggest the Stone—Gear)' framework may not be

appropriate. The emphasis here will be on the average of the two estimates.

tor that explains husband's tastes appears directly, whereas in the wife's

equation the vector is multiplied by a factor of proportionality, 2' In
the husband's equation increases in the age difference increase b1, which increases the marginal utility of work and hence increases the retirement age.4

The husband's own health affects his retirement age in the expected way.

It is interesting that the few husbands who say health limits their work at

home tend to retire later. In th. wife's retirement equation the same negative factor of proportionality that multiplies husband's health should multi-

ply the age difference; yet, there is little consistancey of sign.
In the wife's retirement—age equation, the wife's taste index decreases
in the age difference, which is symmetric with the husband's. taste index.

Thus, if the age difference decreases (the wife becomes older), the marginal

utility of work of the wife increases and she retires later, Just as does the
husband if his age increases. On average a decrease of a year in the age
difference increases the wife's retirement age by 0.27 year, holding constant
the husband's taste index. The responses of the husband and wife are for

practical purposes exactly the same. The effect of age difference on the

wife's taste index in the husband's retirement equation should, at least.
have the same sign over the two samples, but there is no such cons is tancy.

In the wife's retirement equation, the wife's health indicators affect
retirement in the usual way: if health affects work on the Job. b2 decreases

and the wife retires earlier. In the husband's equation, bad health increases the husbands retirement age. The effect is through b2, which if the
factor of proportionality is negative, decreases with bad health. This
reduces the wife's retirement age and increases the husband's.

The total effects of the economic variables cannot be read directly from

the table because of intereactions. As far as the own wage is concerned, it

17

has

a positive effect if all the other economic variables with which it is

intereacted are put to zero. However, if they are evaluated at their sample

Thus increasing the own wage tends to cause earlier retirement, although the

The spouse's wage is interacted with the spouse's taste vector and with
the own wage. Evaluated at no health limitation and no age difference, the
average effect (over both samples) of the wife's wage on the husband's

retiremànt is about -0.02 year per dollar; the effect of the husband's wage
on the wife's retirement is about 0.02 year per dollar. These effects are

practically zero.
The

-

effect of own annuity (the sum of Social Security and pensions) on

retirement age averages about 0.04 year per thousand for husbands and 0.43

for wives. Both suggest the price effect dominates income effects: apparently the annuity gain from delaying retirement is substantial.
The effect of the husband's annuity on the wife's retirement age is prac-

tically zero. An increase in the wife's annuity on the husband's retirement
age is positive and of moderate magnitude. An explanation for this is found
in the wife's response to her own annuity: her retirement age increases, so
the

husband's retirement age also increases.

18
The average effect of assets on the husband's

retirement age is

cally zero. The average change in the wife's retirement age
year

is

practi-

about —0.006

per thousand dollars of assets. Because these data have considerable

variation in assets across households, asset variation can reduce the wife's
retirement age by several years.
The following table sumniarizes the effects of the economic variables.
Part A gives the estimated change in retirement age associated with changing

the economic variables from the 25th percentile point in the distribution of

the variable to the 75th percentile point. Part B gins the changes in the
variables that underlie the calculations.

For example a change of $5.2 thousand in the wife's annuity is estimated to

reduce the wife's retirement age by 2.24 years.
One might well ask whether the Stone-Ceary utility function produces a

reasonable representation of the data. The response of retirement age to the

economic variables certainly seems reasonable, but this is not really a test
of the functional form. The utility function implies a number of cross—

19

equation

restrictions which were not imposed in the estimation. They result

from the appearance of both taste parameters in both retirement equations.
The factor of proportionality is —B2/(l—B1) for the husband's index and —

for the wife's index, and —B and —B2 are the coefficient, on assets. But it would be taking the model beyond reasonable bounds to estimate
and

B from the coefficients on assets for the purpose of checking the

equivalence

of the index parameters because of other implicit factors. For

example, wage rates are in dollars per hour whereas the utility

function refers to lifetime utility. A more generous test of the proportionality

hypothesis rests on whether or not the

Each

is a 12—vector of the estimated coefficients

give the husband's and wife's taste parameters. Each retirement equa-

tion produces two estimates of the fi, one from each data set. The form of the

test comes from noting that one should be able to write each vector as
fi —
where

It1 is a scalar. This implies that B has rank one. The normalized

characteristic roots of E'8 are

.45 .32 .17 and .06.
The second and third are far enough from zero that a formal test was not conducted • and B was concluded to have rank greater than one.

The retirement equations derived from the Stone—Geary utility function

are complicated and difficult to interpret because of the interactions. In

20

that

the

cross—equation restrictions do not seem to hold, a simplified

retirement equation was estimated. Retirement was made linear in all the

variables. The results of that estimation are in Table 11. As before, the estimation method is instrumental variables taking own annuity and assets to

be endogenous variables.

As far as the effects of own taste variables on own retirement age are
concerned, they are about the same as the average effects from the Stone—

Ceary formulation. Both formulations produce an increase in retirement age

of husbands of about 0.25 per year of age difference and 0.27 for wives. The
effects of the own health variables on own retirement age are as follows

they are

similar for husbands and wives. There is, of course, some question

about the interpretation of theses effects: they are based on the reported

health status after retirement. They will be the result of a mixture of
people who become seriously ill so that they cannot work, people who may have

a chronic minor illness so that they choose not to work and a range of people
in between. Although only lX—2X of the individuals report their health affects work at home, they work about a half a year longer than people with no

such health limitation.
The effects of the economic variables can be most easily summarized by

giving the change in retirement age that would result from changing a van—

21

able from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile. The changes in retirement age are as follows

wage response is practically zero here whereas

in the Stone—Geary

it was about —0.5 year. Other differences are that in these

formulation

results an increase in own annuities causes the husband to retire earlier
whereas in the Stone—Ceary results he retired later. The wife's response to

assets is almost three tines as great as before.
The correlation between the residuals from the husband's and wife's

retirement equation is 0.29 in the male data and 0.32 in the female data.
Thus • even

taking into account the age differences and the spouse's economic

variables there still remains unexplained positive correlation between the
retirement ages.
If someone desires to work beyond the normal retirement age associated

with his primary job, often he must change jobs, and often the new job has a
lower wage rate than the primary job (Burtless and Moffitt, 1985; Guslnan and
Steinmeier,

1986). One

would therefore, tend to find a negative association

between the wage and the retirement
last

age.

Put differently, the wage

on the

job depends on the retirement age, so that, according to this reasoning.

it is endogenous in a retirement equation. to check the empirical importance
of this observation, the simplified retirement equation of Table 11 was
reestimated taking the own wage as well as assets and own annuity to be

endogenous. The results are very similar to those in Table 11. so they are

22

not reported. Of particular interest is that the own wage response remains
small.

A further method to find the interaction between retirement ages is to
estimate

a conditional retirement equation. It specifies that the retirement

age of, say, the husband depends on the retirement age of the wife. From
such

an equation one can directly read the magnitude of the dependence. The

theoretical Justification is based on the conditional, distribution of
bivariate normal random variables. If X and Y are bivariate normal random

variables,

then

E(YIX) —,s,+p—'(X—p)
ax

in which p, is E(Y); p, is E(X); p is the correlation coefficient between Y
and a, are the standard errors of Y and X. Let I be the
and X; and
retirement age of the husband and X be the retirement age of the wife. Then,

the coefficient on the retirement age of the wife in the husband's retirement

equation should be p o/a.
Table 12 has the estimated conditional retirement equation. The functional form is the simplified retirement equation of Table 11 with the addi-

tion that the spouse's retirement age enters as a right—hand variable. The

estimated coefficients are qualitatively similar to those reported in Table
11 so they will not be discussed further. Of greater interest is that the
spouse's retirement age is an important explanatory variable. Increasing the
wife's retirement age by a year increases the husband's retirement age by
about 0.25 year (average over both data sets); increasing the husband's
retirement age by a year increases the wife's retirement age by about 0.31

23

year. As discussed earlier, a rough estimate of the effect of the wife's
retirement age on the husband's retirement age can be found

in

from

the

results

Table 7. That effect is 0.41. Given the great difference in methods,

this compares rather well with the estimate in Table 12. These relationships
between retirement ages are in addition to any induced by the age difference,
which by itself would tend to cause retirement dates to be correlated.

The

conditional retirement results may be

compared with unconditional

results by using the theory of normal random variables. As discussed above

the coefficient on X in the relationship E(YIX) should be p

model with endogenous assets •

Thus

the coeff i—

cient on X, the wife's retirement age in the conditional equation for the
husband's retirement age, should be 0.24*2.71/4.15 — 0.16. The actual value
from

Table 12 is 0.18. The following table summarizes the comparisons.

The comparisons are quite close and support further the Joint retirement
hypothesis. The general impression is that the
a

greater effect on

husband's

retirement age has

the wife's retirement age than the wife's on the hus-

band's. This accords with

the

generally accepted view in the labor supply

literature.

5.

Conclusion.

The results support the idea that

the

retirement of husbands and wives is

a Joint process. Often both spouses retire within a short period. The difference

in ago seems to cause substantial variation in retirement age. The

rough estimate from the retirement probabilities is about 0.45 year per year
of age difference. From either the Stone—Geary or the simple model it is
about 0.25.. Given the wide differences in estimation methods, these

estimates are in good agreement and certainly support the joint retirement
hypothesis.
Generally the cross—economic variables
retirement

do not have a strong effect on

ages, so they do not provide a good explanation for the correla-

tion of retirement dates. But it would be surprising to have strong cross
effects given that the own effects are not strong.
partly

This is surely at least

due to weaknesses in the data and to the simplified estimation methods

required by the data. In particular one cannot construct the economic environment in the years before retirement.
The residual correlation between the retirement ages of husbands and

wives also supports the joint retirement hypothesis. Of course one does not
know the cause of the correlation: it could be due to neglected economic
variables, assortative mating, or true complimentarity in the utility function.

25
Much mote research on the Joint retirement decision is needed. In particular, a close modelling of Social Security and pensions should be able to

separate the wealth eEfects from the price effects. Nothing was done here
about adjustment of hours within a year, which is often accompanied by a

reduction in the wage rate. One would hope that future research would be
able

to account for these problems and to find the extent of true com—

plimentarity in retirement.

26

Footnotes
1. Henretta and O'Rand find in the Rfl that increasing the age of the wife
decreases the probability that she will retire after the husband, which seems
to imply a correlation. But this result cannot be interpreted as a joint
retirement decision: one would get the same result if individuals in the
sample were randomly attached to other individuals simply because increasing

age is associated with decreased labor force participation.
2. This table was suggested by David Ellwood.

3. The model does not have a role for the adjustment of annual hours of
work. In this formulation, the wage is implicitly the annual wage (earnings); but in the estimation the hourly wage is used as it is surely a better
measure of the cost of leisure.

4. The dependence of tastes on the age difference was, in estimation not
reported here, represented by 10 dummy variables; the relationship was close
enough to linear that tastes were made linear in age differences between —4
and 6.
5.

This

cause it

correlation is slightly different from what was reported earlier becomes

from an equation in which the own wage is endogenous.
