THE EXCESS SMOOTHNESS OF CONSUMPTION:
IDENTIFICATION AND INTERPRETATION

ABSTRACT

The

econometrician cannot explicitly include the complete set of variables
potentially used by agents

— in the context

phenomenon posed by Deaton 11987].

of the "excess smoothness"

The paper shows that an econometricianwho

fails to take into account the effects of omitted informationwill incorrectly

conclude that an empirical finding of excess smoothness of consumption implies
that the income process is nonstationary.

By contrast, with a more thorough

understanding of the omitted information problem, the finding of excess
smoothness of consumption is easily explained with two assumptions:
consumption data is generated by the excess sensitivity
hypothesis,

a) the

alternative

in which consumption is a weighted average of current income and

permanent income, and b) agents are forecasting on the basis of a larger
information

set than the econometrician.

Further, excess smoothness is

revealed to be consistent with a wide range of stationary income processes as
well as nonstationary income processes.

Thus the common presumption that the

excess smoothness phenomenon is linked in an essential way to the stationarity
or nonstationarity of the income process evaporates when omitted information
is taken into consideration.

In a provocative paper, Deaton [1987] purauaa a line of reasoning which

argument

ia that the income series can be reasonably modeled as positively

autocorrelatedin first differences (or growth rates), implying that a $1
innovation in current income induces a revision in permanent income of more
than $1.

If the variance of revisions in permanent income exceeds the

variance of income forecast errors, as this view suggests, then the
consumptiondata should, under the permanent income hypothesis,

follow a

random walk with innovationvariance larger than the innovationvariance of
the income series.

Empirically, however,

the variance

of the first difference

of consumption, t1c, is smaller than, or approximatelyequal to, the variance
of innovations in income.

Thus Deaton characterizes

which turns inside-out the conventionalnotion that a failure of the permanent
income hypothesis causes consumption to be more variable,

or less smooth, than

predictedby the hypothesis.
While the intuition based on the univariatemodel of income has
considerable appeal, the intuition cannot be made rigorous within the confines

of a univariate time

of income.

It has long been recognized (see

In response to Deaton [1987],

West [1988] showed that if income is generated by a multivariare process,

associated revisions in permanent income will generally have smaller variance
than the error—riddenseries of permanent income revisions calculated from a

In other words, if agents forecast income on the

other than lagged income, the variance of revisions

in

permanent income cannot be identifiedon the basis of a univariate time series
model of income.
Because an econometrician

attemptingto estimate rational expectations

models will be unable to explicitly include all of the informational variables
available to agents, either because of the absence of data or because of
degrees of freedom constraints,

a whole class of empirical rational

expectationsmodels will be characterizedby the property that the information
set used by the econometriciancontains only a subset of the information set
used by agents.

This discrepancybetween the econometrician's

and the agent's

information sets —which has variously been described as the "omitted
information" issue (from the point of view of the econometrician)
"superior

information" issue (from the point

or the

of view of the agent)

— was

first raised by Shiller [1972] in the context of the expectations hypothesis

of the term structure.1
For the reasons indicated above, it seems futile to respond to the
omitted informationproblem by simply adding more and more variables

to the

information set in the econometricmodel.

Virtually sll of the discussion of the use of this projection argument to
finesse the omitted informationproblem has been conducted by first taking as

a premise the validity of the null hypothesis under consideration.

The result

that the omitted informationproblem can be completely end simply eliminated

when the null hypothesis holds is extremely useful for constructing
statistical tests of the null hypothesis.

That is, the resulring statistical

tests are valid even though the econometricisndid not explicitly include

While the projection arguments employed by Hansen and Sargent [1981],
West [1988]. and Campbell and Deston (1988] are indeed robust to the exclusion
of relevant forecastingvariables from the econometricisn's

informationset,

they are not robust to arbitrary departures from the null hypothesis. That
is, if the null hypothesis

way, the signaling variable (the long rate in the term structure

or the

consumption series in the permanent income model) will not fulfill its crucial
role of fully encapsulatingall informationavailable to agents, with the

consequence that the "omitted information" problem remains a problem.

—4.Focusing

on the permanent income application, consider the following

alternativea to the permanent income hypotheaia:

1) Agents spend 95%, or some other fixed fraction, of their current
income each month.
Agents save a fixed dollar amount of income each month as a resetve
against contingencies.
2)

Agents crc "completely Keynesian", with a marginal propensity to
consume out of current income of unity.
3)

Under any of these three alternativehypotheses,
consumption (or, equivalently,

the data series on

the series on saving) would have no information

content which would improve on a univariate income process in predicting
future income.

If the consumption data are

alternativehypotheses, the projectionarguments employed by West [1988] and

As originally stated by

Deaton, the proposition that consumption is too

smooth compared to permanent income is closely tied to the proposition that
income is nonstationary.

Equation (1) was chosen as the exogenous

specificationof labor income because it encompassesboth the stationary and
nonstationary views of income.

For the *conventionalw view that income is a

stationaryprocess around an exponentialtrend, interpret

as labor income

in deviations from trend and assume that the largest root of the

expressed

process is strictly less than one.

1)

stipulation of a structural alternativehypothesis to the permanent income
hypothesis (PIN), and 2) consideration of the effects of the omitted
informationproblem.
Under the PIN, consumption should follow a martingale process, with

Section 3:

Critioue of Campbell and Deaton 119881 and West 119881

Papers by both West [1988] and Campbell and Deaton [1988] recognized that
the original finding of excess smoothness by Deacon [1987] may have heen an
artifact

attributableto the assumptionthat income was a univariate process.

Both papers use a projection argument along the lines of Hansen and Sargent
[1981] in an attempt to finesse the omitted information issue; both papers

conclude that, even when omitted information is taken into account, Deacon's
original finding of excess smoothnessof consumption is confirmed.

which were used in Campbell and Deaton

[1988], were originallyconstructed for use in Blinder and Deaton [1985], and
incorporate several adjustments to the standard NIPA concepts. As described
by Campbell [1987] , these adjustments include:
1) The 1975 tax cut is removed from the disposable income series.
2) Interest payment flows from consumers to business are subtracted from
the NIPA disposable income series.
added to
3) Personal non—tax payments to state and local governments are
both disposable income and consumption, on the grounds that they resemble
payment for goods and services more than taxes (e.g. , state college tuition,
etc.).

4) All series are deflated by total population and by a consumer spending
deflator.
5) Disposable total income is broken down into disposable labor income
and disposable capital income. In addition to using any allocations of tax
payments to capital or labor income which are explicit in the NIPA accounts,
to labor
proprietor's income and personal income tax payments are attributed
and capital income according to their factor shares; social insurance payments
are attributed to labor income. For wore documentation on the construction of
these three variables, the reader is referred to Blinder and Deaton [1985].
Dther variables used in the empirical work were constructed as:

'Shiller [1972] showed thet, under the null hypothesis, if the econometrician

for example, on the basis of lagged short rates only
the implied restriction between the parameters of the short rate autoregressionand the distributed lag of the long rate on lagged short rates was not invalidatedby the
fact that agents are forecasting on the basia of a larger informationset than
the econometrician.
In fact, the discrepancybetween the agent's and econo—
metrician's informationsets was a solution rather than a problem, since the
discrepancyprovided an explanationfor the unavoidable finding that a regression of the long rate on lagged short rates does not generate an R2 of 1.

though the hypothesis that consumptionis a random walk can be statistically

the variance of the first difference of consumptionare not grossly different

in which the excess sensitivity parameter, /3, is set to zero), Campbell
[1987] has referred to equation (23) as the "saving for a rainy day" equation.

linearization is that a) they perceive a time trend in the variance of
