Eligibility and transfer level for the food stamp and the
supplemental social security program is determined by the income of the
household, not by the income of the elderly. Elderly who received supplemental social security incc*se may loose this income once they move to
children with own anccme. This may induce elderly to stay living as an independent household longer than they sey want to in absence

Finally, Schwartz, Danziger and Smolensky (1984) point out a perverse
effect in measured income inequality: if the proportion of independently

elderly increases, then, ceteris paribus, income inequality will

rise because there axe more small households with low income than if

2. Data

and Variable Definitions

An empirical investigation of living arrangement transitions faces
many technical problems.

First, the detection of transitions and an

analysis of living arrangement sequences requires a longitudinal data set

alleviates the problem of locating elderly respondents, they may become invey for

stitutionalized or decease. In most surveys, these persons are then lost
in the sample. Third, a study of living arrangements needs information not
of the family of the elderly

such a study one needs to know a costhination of economic) demographic, and

The data

of the very old, particularly those who have died, and the

transitions preceding death.

depend on age as well as on calendar time. Another important advantage

of

of living arrangement decisions is the collection of
at least some data at the individual level (rather than household level) in
the so—called family—individual file, and the careful recording of
household composition as it relates to the head of household. This makes
it possible to detect elderly living as subfaisilies or as "secondary individuals" in households headed by their children or other persons.

Finally, the non—response file keeps records for persons even when they
become institutionalized. This is in contrast to all major cross—sectional
data sources that comprise either the institutionalized or the non—
institutionalized population, as well as in contrast to most longitudinal
data sources that have only one non—responsecategory and do not distinguish between institutionalization, death, or other reasons for

non—

response.

In

addition to its extreme unwieldiness,6 the PSID has also several

severe shortcomings that limit the kind of analysis

that would be ap-

propriate for the study of the elderly's living arrangements.

which data on children and siblings is imputed implies that elderly who
live as secondary individuals in a composite household and institutionalized elderly have a larger than proportional share of missing

However, the resulting sample selectivity is innocent due to inclusion of constants and the logit functional form (McFadden 1978). The
pooling of cross—sections in this nonlinear model may result also in
biased coefficients.
