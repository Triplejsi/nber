Discussion
The standard public finance textbook defines excess burden of a wage

tax as the difference between consumet welfare under that tax and under a
lump sum tax with the same revenue (e.g. Harvey Rosen, 19B5, Joseph
Stiglitz,

198).

Balanced budget spending is the only experiment that appears in

Given the textbook definitionof total excess burden, a corresponding
concept at the margin would compare the increment in the wage tax to a small
lump sum tax with the same revenue (Auerbach,

b. The other assumptions borrowed from Stuart's model are: q—.2 for the
compensated labor supply elasticity; a—.427 for the marginal tax rate;
and r—da/dr—l.S64 for the constant ratio of the marginal tax rate to

c. It is not possible to use the same assumptions in the Eallard-ShovenWhalley model, for reasons described in the text.
