MAJOR MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES AND LEADING INDEXES:
SOME ESTIMATES OF TUEIR INTERRELATIONS, 1886-1982

ABSTRACT

We examine the interactions within sets of up to six variables representing
output, alternative measures of money and fiscal operations, inflation,

interest rate, and indexes of selected leading indicators. Quarterly series
are used, each taken with four lags, for three periods: 1949-82. 1919-40, and
1886-1914. The series are in stationary form, as indicated by unit root
tests. For the early years, the quality of the available data presents some
serious problems.

We find evidence of strong effects on output of the leading indexes and the

short-term interest rate. The monetary effects are greatly reduced when these

variables are included. Most variables depend more on their own

lagged

values

than on any other factors, but this is not true of the rates of change in

output and the composite leading indexes. Some interesting interperiod
differences are noted and discussed.

Major Macroeconomic Variables and Leading Indexes:
Some Estimates of Their Interrelations, 1886-1982

Victor Zarnowitz and Phillip Braun

I. Background and Objectives

How the economy moves over time depends on its structure, institutions, and

policies, all of which are subject to large historical changes. It would be
surprising if the character of the business cycle did fl2. change in response

to such far-reaching developments as the great contraction of the 1930s and
the post-depression reforms, the expansion of government and private service
industries, the development of fiscal and other built-in stabilizers, and the

increased use and role of discretionary macroeconomic policies. Hence, it is
consistent with our priors that the data for the United States and other
developed market-oriented countries generally support the hypothesis that
business contractions were less frequent, shorter, and milder after World War
II than before (Cordon 1986; Zarnowitz 1989).

Although business cycles have thus moderated, they retain a high degree of
continuity, which shows up most clearly in the comovements and timing

sequences among the main cyclical processes.1 An important aspect of this
continuity is the role of the variables that tend to move ahead of aggregate

output and employment in the course of the business cycle. The composite
index of leading indicators combines the main series representing these

variables. Several studies point to the existence of a relatively close and
stable relationship between prior changes in this index and changes in
macroeconomic activity (Vaccara and Zarnowitz 1977; Auerbach 1982; Zarnowitz

and Moore 1982; Diebold and Rudebusch 1987). Yet, the currently popular small
reduced-form macro models, make little or no use of the leading indicators.2

2

We suspect that the reason is lack of familiarity. The role of the
indicators is probably often misperceived as being purely symptomatic.

Heterogeneous combinations of such series resist easy theoretical

applications. On a deeper level, the notion that the private market economy
is inherently stable led to an emphasis on the role of the monetary and fiscal

disturbances. Interest in the potential of stabilization policies had a
similar effect in that it stimulated work on models dominated by factors
considered to be amenable to government control.

This orientation is understandably appealing but it can easily become one-

sided and error-prone, both theoretically and statistically. For example, a
simple vector autoregressive (VAR) model in log differences of real GNP,
money, and government expenditures suggests the presence of strong lagged
monetary and fiscal effects on output.3 However, it is easy to show that
these relationships are definitely inisspecified. One way to demonstrate this
is by adding changes in a leading index that excludes monetary and financial

components so as not to overlap any of the other variables. In the thus
expanded model, the dominant effects on output come from the past movements of
the leading index, while the roles of the other variables (including the

lagged values of output growth itself) are greatly reduced (see section IV.l

below). In general, omitting relevant variables in a VAR

cause the standard

exogeneity tests, impulse responses, and variance decompositions to be biased,
as shown in L'utkepohl 1982 and Braun and Mittnik 1985.

The first objective of this paper is to examine the lead-lag interactions
within larger sets of important macroeconomic variables, including interest
and inflation rates along with output, monetary and fiscal variables, and a

nonduplicative leading index. The rationale for including this index is

twofold. (1) The changes in the leading index can be interpreted broadly as

3

representing dynamic forces within the private economy: the early collective
outcomes of investment and production (also, less directly, consumption)

decisions. Presumably, it is mainly these forces that account for the
continuity of business cycles. Both aggregate demand and aggregate supply
shifts are involved but the demand effects may be stronger in the short run.

(2) The addition of the leading index helps us overcome the omitted variables
bias. The index stands for a number of important factors that would otherwise
be omitted. It would not be practical to include the several individual
series to represent these variables.
We work with equations that include up to six variables, plus constant

terms and time trends. They are estimated on quarterly series, each taken
with four lags, which means using up large numbers of degrees of freedom.
Given the size of the available data samples, it is not possible for such
models to accomodate more variables, while retaining a chance to produce

estimates of parameters in which one could have some confidence. It is, of
course, easy to think of additional variables that might be important enough

for their omission to cause some serious misspecifications. All vector
autoregressive (VAR) models face this dilemma, but the only way to avoid it is

by assuming a full structural model which could be still more deficient. We
seek some partial remedies in alternative specifications guided by economic
theory and history as well as comparisons with related results in the
literature.

Although the format adopted is that of a VAR model, the implied systemwide dynamics, i.e., impulse response functions and variance decompositions,

are beyond the scope of this study. These statistics seek to describe
behavior in reaction to innovations, require longer series of consistent data
than are actually available,4 and are probably often very imprecise even for

4
smaller systems (cf. Zellner 1985 and Runkle 1987 with discussion).

In

contrast, there is sufficient information to estimate well the individual

equations, even with more lagged terms. We find that much can be learned from
attention to the quality and implications of these estimates,

which are

logically prior to inferences on overall dynamics but carry no commitment to

the particular interpretations of a VAR model. Moreover, our interest centers
on cyclical movements, that is, on the interplay of forces over shorter time
horizons, not on long-term consequences of some assumed shocks.
Our second and related objective is to extend the analysis to the periods
between the two world wars and earlier in another effort to study the

continuity and change in U.S. business cycles. To evaluate any persistent
shifts or the secular evolution in the patterns of macroeconomic

fluctuation,

it is of course necessary to cover long stretches of varied historical

experience. Estimates of the interrelations among the selected variables are
calculated from quarterly seasonally adjusted data for three periods:

1886-1914, 1919-40, and 1949-82. We ask generally, what similarities and
differences between the three periods are suggested by this exercise.

Historical data are scanty and deficient, which inevitably creates some

difficult choices and problems. The next part of the paper (II) discusses
this and lists the variables and series used Part III discusses

the applied

methods and presents tests that determine what transformations must be used on
any of the series to validate our statistical procedures. Part IV examines
the results, focusing on simple exogeneity and neutrality tests

for a

succession of models as well as on interperiod comparisons. Part V sums up
our conclusions and views on the need for further work.

II. Date

1. The Selected Variables and Their Reoresentations
Table I serves as a summary of the information on the data used in

this study. It defines the variables and identifies the time series by title,
period, symbol, and source. Some notes on how the underlying data are derived
are included as well.

The table includes 11 different variables and 23 segments of the

corresponding series, counting one per period (columns 2 and 3). No equation
contains more than six variables. Some variables have different representations across the three periods covered because consistent data are not

available for them. Further, unit root tests indicate that, in some cases,
levels of a series ought to be used in one period, differences in another.

These tests and the required transformations are discussed in section 111.2

below. As shown in column 4, natural logarithms are taken of all series
except the commercial paper rate. Federal expenditures in 1886-1914, the
fiscal index in 1949-82, and the interest rate in both of these periods are
level series; in all other cases first difference series are used.

Lower letters serve as symbols for variables cast in form of first
differences, capital letters for those cast in levels (Table 1, column 5).

The series relating to output (q), prices (p), the alternative monetary
aggregates (b,m1,m2), and interest (I or i) are staple ingredients of small

reduced-form or VAR models. They are characterized in the table on lines
numbered 1-7.

Of the additional series, three represent fiscal variables (8-10). For the
postwar period, there is an index combining federal spending, debt, and taxes

(C). For the interwar and prewar periods, there are two segments of the
federal expenditures series (gx and CX, respectively).

6
Finally, there are three different indexes of leading indicators (11-13).
The only such series presently available for 1886-1914 is a diffusion index

based on specific cycles in individual indicators (ldc). The composite
indexes for 1919-40 and, particularly, for 1949-82 (d and 2, respectively)
are much more satisfactory.

2.

Sources and Problems

The "standard" historical estimates of GNP before World War II based mainly
on the work of Kuznets, Kendrick, and Gailman, are at most annual. We use the
new quarterly series for real GNF and the implicit price deflator from

a1ke

and Gordon 1986. These data are constructed from the standard series by
means of quarterly interpolators which include the Persons 1931 index of
industrial production and trade before 1930, the FRE industrial production

index for 1930-40, constant terms, and linear time trends. The use of
interpolations based on series with narrower coverage than GNP is a source of

unavoidable

error if the unit period is to be shorter than a year.6

The historical annual estimates of U.S. income and output leave much to be
desired but it is difficult to improve on them because the required informa-

tion simply does not exist. The series have been recently reevaluated,
leading to new estimates by Romer, 1986 and 1987 and alke and Gordon, 1988.
Romer's method imposes certain structural characteristics of the U.S. economy

in the post-World War II period on the pre-Worid War I data. This produces
results that contradict the evidence on postwar moderation of the business
cycle by prejudging the issue (L.ebergott 1986; Weir 1986; Balke and Cordon

1988). It is mainly for this reason that we do not use Romers data.

7

The basic source of historical monetary statistics (monthly since Play 1907,

biennial earlier) is Friedman and Schwartz 1970. Here too interpolations
based on related series are applied in early years. The data for money (like
those for income, output, and prices) improve over time but are never without

serious problems. The interwar and postwar series are produced by the Federal
Reserve Board (FRB).

Market interest rates are more easily and much better measured than the

macroeconomic aggregates and indexes on our list. The commercial paper rate
series (Macaulay 1938, FRB) is of good quality, at least in a comparative
sense.

The Blanchard fiscal index is designed to measure "the effect of fiscal
policy on aggregate demand at given interest rates" (Blanchard and Watson

1986, p. 149). This series moves countercyclically most of the time, hence
presumably retains in large measure elements of built-in tax-and-transfer

stabilizers. For the earlier periods, no comparable comprehensive index is
available, and we use the series on federal expenditures from Firestone 1960.

From the leading index of the Commerce Department for 1949-82 we exclude
real money balances (M2 deflated by the consumer price index) and change in

business and consumer credit outstanding. This is done to avoid overlaps or
conflicts with the monetary variables covered in our equations. The stock
price component (Standard & Poor's index of 500 common stocks) may be strongly
affected by monetary and fiscal developments and, adopting a conservative

bias, we remove it as well. The so adjusted composite index consists of nine
series representing primarily the early stages of fixed capital investment,

inventory investment, and marginal adjustments of employment and production.7
The only composite index of leading indicators available in the literature

8

for the interwar period covers six series: average workweek; new orders for
durable manufacturers; nonfarm housing starts; commercial and industrial
construction contracts; new business incorporations; and Standard and Poor's
index of stock prices. The index is presented and discussed in Shiskin 1961.
Its method of construction is very similar to that used presently for the

Commerce index.8 The coverage of the Shiskin index, though narrower, also
resembles that of the postwar index, particularly when the money and credit

components are deleted from the latter. The one major difference is that the
interwar index is based on changes in the component series over 5-month spans,

whereas the postwar index is based on month-to-month changes.9
Unfortunately, no composite index of leading indicators exists for the pre-

World War I period. To compute such an index from historical data would
certainly be worth while but also laborious; the project must be reserved for

the future. In the meantime, we report on some experimental work with the
only available series that summarizes the early cyclical behavior of a set of

individual leading indicators. The set consists of 75 individual indicators
whose turning points have usually led at business cycle peaks and troughs. It
covers such diverse areas as business profits and failures, financial market
transactions and asset prices, bank clearings, loans, and deposits, sensitive
materials prices, inventory investment, new orders for capital goods,

construction contracts, and the average workweek. Moore 1961 presents a
diffusion index showing the percentage expanding of these series in each month
of 1885-1940. The index is based on cyclical turns in each of its components:
a series is simply counted as rising during each month of a specific cycle

expansion and declining otherwise. Clearly, the type of smoothing implicit in
this index construction is ill-suited for our purposes (it was designed for a

9

very different task of historical timing analysis). Nevertheless, for lack of
any other measure, we use this diffusion index by cumulating its deviations
from 50 and taking log differences of the results.

III. The Statistical Framework

1. Method of Estimation
Conflicting macromodels draw support not only from different theoretical
rationalizations of economic behavior but also, when implemented econome-

trically, from different empirical priors imposed on the data. Dissatisfaction with the "incredible identification" of existing large-scale
simultaneous equation systems led to the recent popularity of vector
autoregressions, which treat all variables as endogenous and shun unfounded a

priori restrictions. The method has been used in attempts to discriminate
among alternative explanations of money-income causality (cf. Sims 1980), a
question similar to the ones posed in this paper.
This paper examines the interactions within a larger set of macroeconomic variables than that considered in the money-income causality studies.

The particular statistics that interest us in this context are exogeneity and
neutrality tests for the selected macrovariables within the different time
periods.

Define x

as a generic variable with s denoting the time series

(q,p,b...) and i denoting the time frame (prewar, interwar, postwar). We
estimate ordinary least squares regressions of the form:

2. Unit Roots and Transformations
Since the work of Nelson and Plosser 1982 a lot of interest has been paid

to the existence of unit roots in macroeconomic time series. The magnitudes
of the secular and cyclical components of these series receive primary

attention in the work of Cochrane 1988 and Campbell and Mankiw 1987. Sims,
Stock, and Watson 1986 also consider the role unit roots play in hypothesis

testing with VAR's. They show that, to interpret correctly exogeneity and
neutrality tests using standard asymptotic theory, it is necessary to

transform the data to zero-mean stationary series. Moreover, Stock and Watson
1987 shed new light on the long debated problem of money-income causality by

taking into account non-stationarities. Therefore, because of both an
explicit interest in the results and also the necessity of having stationary
series to employ standard asymptotic theory, we calculate a set of unit root
tests.

We test the null hypothesis

restricted to be zero, or around a time trend, when

The unit root tests are presented in Tables 2, 3, and 4 for the postwar,

interwar, and prewar sample periods, respectively. Part A of each table
includes the tests for a single unit root for each series, calculated by using

levels. Part B contains tests for a second unit root calculated by using
first differences.

Because there does not exist a uniformly most powerful test for unit roots,

we use two different sets of test statistics. To test the hypothesis that a
series is stationary around its mean, we estimate the Dickey-Fuller
statistic (column 2 in Tables 2, 3, and 4) and the Stock-Watson qlSf statistic

(column 3). These statistics restrict S in the alternative hypothesis (eqn.
5) to be zero. To test the hypothesis that a series is stationary around a
linear time trend, we estimate the Dickey-Fuller

statistic (column 4) and

the Stock-Watson qTf statistic (column 5).

The Dickey-Fuller statistics are calculated by estimating via OLS the
following transformation of equation 5

The critical values for these statistics are tabulated in Fuller

of
1976.

The Stock-Watson test statistics we use are based on the more general
Stock-Watson qf(k,m) test for common trends in a vector of time series

variables. The statistic is simply
qf(k,w) —

(8)

where I is the largest root of the sample autocorrelation matrix. The qf(k,uI)
statistic tests the hypothesis of k versus m unit roots for a n-vector time

series (m < k

n). For the univariate tests used here the null hypothesis

(egn. 4) is one unit root, k —
root, is —

0.

the alternative (eqn. 5) of no unit

The critical values for the qf and qTf statistics are tabulated

in Stock and Watson 1986.

We also test for the order of any deterministic components in these series.
We regressed the level and first difference of each series against a constant,

time, and four of its own lags. Column 6 reports the t-statistic from the
time coefficients. Likewise we tested for significant drift terms by
replicating this estimation without a time tread. Column 7 reports the tratio on the constant term.

Looking at the results for the postwar sample (Table 2) only the fiscal
index is stationary in levels around its mean as well as around a time trend.
The leading index and the commercial paper rate are stationary in levels

around a time trend only. All postwar series are stationary in first
differences, with significant time trends occuring for all three money series

and prices. We infer from this that it is necessary to take first differences
of real GNP. money, and prices.

13

Although the tests indicate the leading index is stationary in levels

around a

time

trend, we decided to perform our subsequent analysis using first

differences. This is because the leading index has a built-in nonstationary
component constructed from the trend of the coincident index (see U.S.

Department of Commerce 1984. PP. 65-69). Because this nonstationary component
is implicitly related to the trend rate of growth of CNP and we take first
differences of CNP, we also take first differences of the leading index.
According to Sims, Stock, and Watson 1986 the presence of significant trends
in the series of money and price changes, it necessary to include a time trend
in our equations to permit us to use standard asymptotic theory to interpret
the exogeneity and neutrality tests.

Because of the small sample size for the interwar period (Table 3), 87
observations, the unit root tests are more difficult to interpret for this

sample period. For levels (Part A) the Dickey-Fuller tests indicate that the
interest rate is stationary around a time trend and the price level is

stationary around its mean. The Stock-Watson tests contradict these particular results, however, bringing into question the power of these tests (see

Dickey and Fuller 1979 for power calculations of ).

Looking at the tests on

differences (Part B), the tests indicate that all of the interwar series are
stationary, except for the Dickey-Fuller tests for and around a trend and the

monetary base around its mean. However, these particular tests again
contradict the Stock-Watson tests. Because of these results we act
conservatively and use first differences of all of the interwar series.
Moreover, following the arguments for the postwar sample, a time trend is also
necessitated by the significant t-ratios for m1, b, and g on the trend coefficients.

14

Finally, for the prewar sample (Table 4) it is sufficient to take first
differences only of real CNP, the monetary base, 112, the implicit price
deflator while the series on government expenditures and the interest rate carl

be left in levels. Again, although the tests indicate the leading diffusion
index is stationary in levels around a trend, we instead use first differences

of this series in our subsequent analysis. This is because the trend is
artificially induced via the accumulation of the original series. A time
trend is also included because of the significant trend coefficient for
inflation.

IV. The Results
1. Factors Influencing Changes in Real CNP: A Stepwise Approach

(a) 1949-1982
Table 5 is based on regressions of real GNP growth on its own past

i—

1

4) and the lagged values of 2-5 other selected series, plus a

constant term and time. Each variable has the form shown in Table 1, column
4, as indicated by the tests discussed in part III. The calculations proceed
by successively expanding the set of explanatory variables, in four steps.
First only the lagged terms of q are used along with the corresponding values

of a fiscal and a monetary variable. To this are added, second, the inflation
group, and, third, the interest rate group. The last step consists in
including the leading index terms as well.
This table and those that follow are standardized to show the F-statistics

for conventional tests of exogeneity and, underneath these entries, the tstatistics for the neutrality tests, i.e., for the

of the regression

coefficients of the same groups of lagged terms for each variable. The

15

estimated individual coefficients are too numerous to report and their
behavior is difficult to describe in the frequent cases where their successive

values oscillate with mixed signs. It seems advisable, however, to show at
least the summary t-ratios in each equation. When sufficiently large, these
statistics suggest that the individual terms in each group are not all weak or
not all transitory, that is, that they do not offset each other across the
different lags.
In the 1949-82 equations with three variables only, the lagged q terms are
always significant at least at the 5% level; each of the monetary alternatives

makes a contribution (m2 is particularly strong); and the fiscal index C is
relatively weak, except when used along with the monetary base b (Table 5,

part A, equations 1-3). Adding inflation p is of little help in explaining q,
but on balance the coefficients of p are negative and some may matter (eqs. 4-

6). When the commercial paper rate I is entered, it acquires a dominant role
at the expense of the other (especially the monetary) variables (eqs. 7-9).

Finally, equations 10-12 show that, of all the variables considered, the rate

of change in the leading index exerts the strongest influence on q. Five of
the test statistics for i are significant at the 1/10 of one percent level,

one at the 1% level. The level of interest rates represented by I retains its
strong net inverse effect on q. The direct contributions of m1, in2, and C to
the determination of real CNP growth are much fewer and weaker, those of b and
p are altogether difficult to detect.11

Alternative calculations show that when 1 is added to the equations with
the monetary and fiscal variables only, the effects of these variables on q

are again drastically reduced. Had we retained the money, credit, and stock
price components in the leading index, the role of the index in these

16

equations would have been even stronger, that of the other regressors
generally weaker.12

The changes in the index can be interpreted broadly as representing dynamic

forces within the private economy: the early collective outcomes of investment and production (also, less directly, consumption) decisions. Presumably,
both aggregate demand and aggregate supply shifts are involved, but the

effects of the former are likely to be stronger in the short run. In any
event, the evidence indicates that the quarterly movements of the economy's
output in 1949-82 depended much more on recent changes

in leading indicators

and interest rates than on recent changes in output itself, money, the fiscal
factor, and inflation.

Conceivably, longer lags could produce different results, so we checked to
see what happens when eight instead of four lags are used.

These tests

suggest some gains in power for the lagged q and C terms, but the leading

index and the interest rate still have consistently strong effects. However,
we do not report these statistics because the restriction to lags of 1-4
quarters is dictated by the limitations of the available data. With eight
lags, for example, the number of degrees of freedom is reduced

from 109 to 81

for the six-variable equations.

(b) 1919-1940
In the equations for the interwar period, all variables appear in form of

first differences. In the first subset (Table 5, part B, eqs. 13-15). q
depends positively on its own lagged values and those of the monetary

variables, inversely on the recent values of federal expenditures gx. All the
F-statistics are significant, most highly so. On the other hand, inflation
contributes but little to these regressions, as shown by the results for

17

equations 16-18 (only two t-tests indicate significance and none of the F-

tests). Further, no gains at all result from the inclusion of the change in
the commercial paper rate (eqs. 19-21).

In contrast, there is strong evidence in our estimates for 1919-40 that the
lagged rates of change in the index of six leading indicators (Id) had a large

net positive influence on q. Four of the corresponding test statistics are
significant at the 1% level, two at the 5% level (part B. column 6). In these
equations (22-24), ld shows the strongest effects, followed by the monetary
variables; gx is significant only in one case; and the tests for lagged q, p.
and i terms are all negative.

On the whole, the monetary series appear to play a somewhat stronger role
in the interwar than in the postwar equations, while the leading series appear

to play a somewhat weaker role. It should be recalled, however, that 1 is a
more comprehensive index than Id and is based on better data. Even for the
series hat are more comparable across the two periods the quality of the

postwar data is probably significantly higher)3 Further, the reliability of
the results for 1919-40 suffers from the small sample problem: the number of
observations per parameter to be estimated is here little more than half the
number available for 1949-82.

In light of these considerations it seems important to note that the
interwar results resemble broadly the postwar results in most respects and

look rather reasonable, at least in the overall qualitative sense. The
leading indexes are highly effective in the regressions for both periods. The
main difference between the two sets of estimates is that the commercial paper
rate contributes strongly to the statistical explanation of q in 1949-82 but
the change in that rate does not help in the 1919-40 regressions (cf. columns

18

5 in parts A and B of Table 5). We checked whether interest levels (I) would
have performed significantly better than interest changes (i) in the interar
equations. and the answer is no.

(c) l886-l91
For the pre-Worid War I period, the equations with three variables indicate
strong effects on q of its own lagged values and those of in2, but no signi-

ficant contributions of either the monetary base or government expenditures

(Table 5, part C, eqs. 25-26). The inflation terms add only a weak negative
influence, as shown in the summary t-statistics for equations 27-28.
The recent values of the commercial paper rate have substantial inverse
effects on the current rate of change in real CNP. particularly in the
equations with the base and after the change in diffusion index of leading

indicators (ldc) is added (eqs. 29-32). The Edc index itself appears to be
ineffective. In light of the major importance of the leading indexes in the
postwar and interwar equations, this negative result is probably attributable
mainly to the way .Edc is constructed. (Recall from our discussion in section
11.1 that this index uses only the historical information on specific-cycle
turning

points

in a set of 75 individual indicators.)

2. Test Statistics for Six-Variable Equations

(a) 1949-1982
Each of the monetary variables (b,m1,m2) depends strongly on its own lagged
values and those of the interest rate I, as shown by the corresponding F-

values in Table 6, equations 1-3. The I terms have coefficients whose signs
vary and their t-statistics are on balance small, though mostly negative. The
fiscal index C appears to have a strong positive effect on in,

and the time

19

trends in column 7 are important. The effects of the other variables are
sporadic and weak.

C is more strongly autoregressive yet. It also depends positively on b and
and inversely on I. the change in the leading index 1. and time (equations
4-6).

Inflation p also depends mainly on its own lagged values, according to

equations 7-9. A few relatively weak signs of influence appear for b, I, and

C. The time trends are significant. These results are consistent with a view
of the price level as a predetermined variable adjusting but slowly with

considerable inertia. Monetary influences on p involve much longer lags than
are allowed here.
The interest rate depends most heavily on its own recent levels, as is

immediately evident from equations 10-12. Still, some significant inputs into
the determination of I (which yields R2 as high as .95) are also made by other
factors, notably m1 and 1.

As for 1, it is not strongly influenced by either its own recent past or

that of the other variables. The largest F-values here are associated with
the interest rate in equations 13 and 14 and with inflation in equation 15.

The corresponding tests for real GNP (q) equations have already been
discussed in the previous section (relating to the estimates in the last six

lines of Table 5, part A). It is interesting to note that very few significant F or t statistics are associated with the lagged q terms according to
our tests (Table 6, column 1).

(b) 1919-1940
Tests based on the interwar monetary regressions indicate high serial

dependence for m1 and m2 but not b (Table 7. eqs. 1-3). The base is

20

influenced strongly by recent changes in output q, moderately by those in the

leading index Id. There are signs of some effects on m2 of Id and p. but no
measurable outside influences on
Equations 4-6 for the rate of change in government expenditures gx produce
F-statistics that are generally low and apparently significant only for the

lagged values of the dependent variable. The same applies to the equations
10-12 for the change in the interest rate i.

The rate of inflation p depends heavily on its own lagged values, too (eqs.

7-9). Some of the test statistics suggest that

Id, and perhaps i, may

influence p slightly over the course of a year.

Interestingly, according to equations 13-15, Id is affected much more
strongly by the recent monetary chagnes than by its own lagged values. There

are also some signs of influence of gx on Id. This raises the possibility
that monetary and fiscal changes, including those due to policy actions, may
affect real GNP with long lags through the mediating role of the leading

indicators (Id). But note that this is only suggested by the estimates for
the interwar period, not those for the postwar era.13
Comparing Tables 6 and 7 and drawing also on Table 5 (parts A and B,
equations 10-12 and 22-24), we observe that q depends strongly on the leading
indexes (I,ld) in both periods and on the monetary factors in the interwar

period. The autoregressive elements are weak in q, 1, and Id and strong (as a
rule dominant) in the other variables according to the interwar as well as the

postwar estimates. The effects of q on the other factors are generally weak
or nonexistent.

(c) 1886-1914
The F-statistics for the own-lag terms are significant in all the pre-Worid

21

War I equations, highly so (at the 0.1% level) for the monetary, fiscal.
leading, and interest series, less so for q and p (see Table 8 and Table 5, C,

equations 30-32). The leading index idc for 1886-1914 is very strongly
autocorrelated, in contrast to the indexes Id for 1919-40 and 1 for 1949-82.

This reflects the construction of the prewar index, which assumes smooth
cyclical movements in the index components (cf. section 11.2 above).

Prewar changes in the monetary base are poorly "explained, mainly by own
lags and those of government expenditures CX and the commercial paper rate I.

The corresponding changes in the stock of money m2 are fit much better by
lagged values of

itself, I, and p. And as much as 94% of the variance of

CX is explained statistically, mainly by lagged CX terms and the time trend.
(See Table 8, eqs. 1-4).

The estimates for inflation p are problematic. They suggest that p was
influenced positively by lagged money changes but also inversely by its own
lagged values and those of I and .Rdc. The R2 coefficients are of the order of
0.2-0.3 (eqs. 5-6).

The equations for the interest rate (7-8), besides being dominated by
autoregressive elements, indicate some short-term effects of q (with plus
signs) and m2 (minus). These results seem generally reasonable.
The leading diffusion index Idc (eqs. 9-10) depends primarily on own lags,

with traces of positive effects of q and p and negative effects of I. In view
of the probable measurement errors involved (mainly in the .Edc series), the
serviceability of these estimates is uncertain.

V. Conclusions and Further Steps
The following list of our principal findings begins with a point of

22
particular importance, which receives clear support from the better-quality
data available to us for the postwar and interwar periods.

1. Output depends strongly on leading indexes in equations which include
also the monetary, fiscal, inflation, and interest variables (all taken in

stationary form, with four quarterly lags in each variable). Hence models
that omit the principal leading indicators are probably seriously
misspecified.

2. Short-term nominal interest rates had a strong inverse influence on
output (specifically, the rate of change in real GNP) during the 1949-82

period. When interest is included, the effects of the monetary and fiscal
series are reduced (this resembles the results of some earlier studies; cf.

Sims 1980). When the leading index is also included, most of the monetary
effects are further diminished.

3. In the interwar period, the role of money appears greater, while the
fiscal and interest effects tend to wane. In the prewar (1886-1914)
equations, output is influenced mainly by its own lagged values and those of

the money stock and the interest rate. The other factors including a
diffusion index based on specific cycles in a large set of individual leading

series, have no significant effects. However, this probably reflects errors
in the data, especially the weakness of the available leading index.

4. The monetary, fiscal, and interest variables depend more on their own
lagged values than on any of the other factors, and the same is true of

inflation, except in 1886-1914. The opposite applies to the rates of change
in output and (again, except in 1886-1914) the leading indexes. None of the
variables in question can be considered exogenous.

5. The reported unit root tests are consistent with earlier findings that

23

most macroeconomic time series are difference-stationary (see Nelson and
Plosser 1982 on annual interwar and postwar data, and Stock and Watson 1987 on

monthly postwar data). The major exceptions to this are the prewar and
postwar fiscal and interest series.

Our work offers some suggestions for further research. The following steps
should be taken or at least considered:

(a) Construct a satisfactory composite index of leading indicators for the
periods before World War II from the best available historical data.

(b) Compute variance decompositions and impulse response functions for
alternative subsets of up to four variables represented by the quarterly
series used in this paper.

(c) Do the same computations for larger sets of six variables by using
monthly data. This would complement the results obtained here for individual
equations in the same sets; further, it would permit comparisons with some

recent smaller VAR models estimated on monthly data. The main problem with
this approach is that no good monthly proxies for GNP may be found.

(d) Update the postwar series and check on predictions beyond the sample
period, e.g., for 1983-88.

(e) Try to find Out where the explanatory or predictive power of the
leading index is coming from by testing important subindexes relating to
investment commitments profitability, etc.

(f) Compare the implications of this paper with those of the most recent
and ongoing studies of leading indicators (de Leeuw 1988, 1989; Stock and
Watson 1988 a,b).

Footnotes

1For assessments and references concerning the U.S. record, see Moore 1983,
chapters 10 and 24, and Zarnowitz and Moore 1986.
2Large econometric models incorporate some individual indicators but probably
suboptimally and not in a comprehensive and systematic way.
3This recalls the old St. Louis Fed model with its reliance on "policy
variables" only.

4With m — 6 variables and k — 4 lags, km2 — 144. For a sample period 1949:21982:4 covered by our postwar series, the number of degrees of freedom is 109.
5New annual estimates of nominal GNP. the implicit price deflator (1982—100),
and real GNP for 1869-1929 are presented in Balke and Gordon 1988. This study
develops some additional sources for direct measurement of nonmanufacturing
output and the deflator. It concludes that real GNP was on the average about
as volatile as the traditional Kuznets-Kendrick series indicate but that the
GNP deflator was significantly less volatile. These estimates appeared too
late to be taken into account in this paper.
6The Persons index consists of a varying assortment of weighted and spliced
series on bank clearings outside New York City, production of pig iron and
electric power, construction contracts, railroad car loadings and net tonmiles of freight, indexes of volume of manufacturing and mining, etc. The
compilation is spotty and uneven, particularly before 1903. A few other
historical indexes of business activity are available but they have similar
limitations (Zarnowitz 1981).

7These indicators are: average workweek, manufacturing; average weekly
initial claims for unemployment insurance; vendor performance (percent of
companies receiving slower deliveries); change in sensitive materials prices;
manufacturers' orders in constant dollars, consumer goods and materials
industries; contracts and orders for plant and equipment in constant dollars;
index of net business formation; building permits for new private housing
units; change in manufacturing and trade inventories on hand and on order in
constant dollars.
8Percent changes in each component series (computed so as to insure
symmetrical treatment of rises and declines) are standardized, i.e., expressed
as ratios to their own long-run mean, without regards to sign. The resulting
changes are averaged across the series for each month and then cumulated into
an index. Simple averages are used by Shiskin, weighted averages by Commerce,
but this makes little difference since the Commerce weights, based on
performance scores of the selected indicators, are nearly equal. Also, the
Commerce index has a trend adjusted to equal the trend in the index of
coincident indicators (which is close to the trend in real CNP), whereas the
Shiskin index has no such adjustment. Cf. Shiskin 1961, pp. 43-47 and 123125; U.S. Department of Commerce 1984, pp. 65-70.

25

9Except for the inventory and price components which are weighted 4-month
moving averages, trailing.
10

The addition of I reduces further the statistics for p. The simple
correlation between I and p in 1949-82 is about 0.7. During the latter part
of the postwar era, inflation spread and accelerated and financial markets
became increasingly sensitive to it. Since I depends on the real interest
rate R and expected inflation (i.e., forecasts of p. probably based in part on
our results suggest an independent role for R in codetermining q.

These results are not inconsistent with b influencing q with longer lags via
changes in m1 or m2 or I; or with a negative effect on output of inflation
uncertainty, which is found in some studies that work with higher moments or
forecasts of inflation (see, a.o., Makin 1982; Litterinan and Weiss 1985;
Zarnowitz and Lambros 1987).
l2 should be noted that the index is robust in the sense of not being
critically dependent on any of its individual components or their weights.
Thus any large subset of these indicators can produce a fair approximation to
the total index under the adopted construction and standardization procedures.
Some of the components are known to have good predictive records of their own
stock prices, as shown in Fischer and Merton 1984) but the leading
index outperforms any of them on the average over time. The reductions in
coverage and diversity detract from the forecasting potential of the index
but, up to a point, moderately. And, as in the present case, they may often
be advisable for analytical purposes.

(e.g..

13The difference could be related to the fact that the interwar index
includes, while the postwar index excludes, the stock price series. Financial
asset prices and returns are probably subject to stronger monetary and fiscal
influences than other leading indicators are.
