THE HEALTH AND EARNINGS OF REJECTED DISABILITY INSURANCE APPLICANTS
ABSTRACT

Applicants for Social Security Disability Benefits who fail to pass the medical screening form a
natural 'control' group for beneficiaries. Data drawnfrom the 1972 and 1978 surveys of the disabled
done for the Social Security Administration show that fewer than 50% of rejected male applicants
work. Typical earnings of those that do are less than 50% of median earnings for other men their
age. These data cast doubt on recent econometric work which suggeststhat the disincentive effects
of DI have been substantial.

The postwar period hss seen a dramatic increase both in the availabilityand in the generosity
of income maintenance programs targeted at the disabled. The Social Security DisahilityProgram
(DI) was enacted into law in 1956. Originally,in orderto qualify for Dl henefits an individualhad
to be over the age of 50 and to suffer from an impairment that could "be expected to result in
death or be of long, continued and indefinite duration." In 1960 individuals under the age of 50
were made eligible, and in 1965 the definition of disahilitywas liberalized to allow those without
permanent disabilities to qualify. In 1972 the waiting period required before an applicant for DI
could start receivingbenefits was reduced from 6 to 5 months, and the work history requirement
was effectively eliminated with the introduction of Supplemental Security Income.1 At the same
time that eligibility requirementsfor DI were being relaxed,benefit levels were beingincreased,2so
that by the mid-1970'stypicalafter-tax replacementrates reached 60%. When dependents' benefits
are included3, the total compensationcan easily replace all of a worker's lost earnings.
With the increasingavailabilityand generosity of disabilitybenefits, the DI rolis grew rapidly
during the 1960's and 1970's. In 1960 208,000 workers were awarded benefite. By 1975 this figure
had risen to 592,000. During the same time period the fraction leaving the roles each year declined
from 20% to 13%. With a rising number of awards and a decliningtermination rate, by 1980, 2.9
millionworkers (3% of the working-age population) were receiving DI benefits. Total benefits paid
out exceeded 15 biliion dollars or 20% of those paid out for retirement benefits. With the rapidly
expanding roles, there was an increased concern that the social security administration was losing
control over the system and that many of those awarded DI benefitsmight not, in fact, be disabled
accordingto the legal definition of the term.5
Both DI and SSI are administeredby the Social Security Administration. Dl provides benefits to disabled
workers in anossturelated to the disabled worker's former wages in Social Security-covered employment. 551

fail to pass the medical screeningnecessary to qualify for the program. This rejected pool providea
a natural control group for the beneficiaries. The assumption(documeoted helow) is that
rejected
applicants are healthier and more capable of work than those who were accepted. Thus, their labor
force performance should provide an upper bound for what could be expected of beneficiaries. It is
thus startling that, even among prime-aged men, fewer than 50% of rejected applicants return to
sustained work, and that the earningsof those that do are roughly 30% below pre-disahility levels
and more than 50% helow those for other men their age.
I infer from these facts that less than half of those on DI would work were they not receiving
benefits. Recall that the drop in participation rates has more than matched the rise in the proportion of older men on DI. Thus DI accounts for substantially less than half of the post-war decline
in the participation rates of older men.
Yet if DI can arcoont for less than half of the drop in labor force participation we are left with
a number of questions. What accounts for the other half? What would the counterparts of the
men now receivingDI have been doing prior to Dl's existence? In the last section of this
paper I
try to answer these broader questions by taking a closer look at the historicalrecord. I argue that
the record suggests that DI has pulled a substantial number of its beneficiaries from a
population
that would have been out of work regardlessof whether or not DI was available. Evidencefor this
conclusion comes from the fact that before DI existed (or before it had
grown to its current size),
there was a sizable population of older men who both identified themselves as disabled and who
were out of the labor force. The natural assumption is that these men, or their counterparts in
subsequent cohorts, would be amongthose on the DI rolls. A coherent picture of DI thus emerges.
While it seems likely that DI has had someimpact on the lahor force attachment of older men, it
also seems likely that DI has successfully targeted resources to the genuinely disabled.
The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: In Section 1, I document the facts
relating to
rejected applicants. In Section II, I discuss objectionsto the inferences I am drawing from these
facts. Section III reconciles the evidence on rejectesi applicants with that from previous studies
which have suggested large disincentive effects. In Section IV, I review the historical evidenceand
conclude with a summary of the argument.8

pre- and post-application earningsI used the Social Security earnings history. Simple tabulations
showed that amongthe rejected applicants that did work some time during 1971 (1977),69% (60%)
experienced a declinein real annual earnings)6 To estimate the averageearnings drop I calculated
the earnings differential between rejected applicants and non-applicantstwo yearsprior to the year
of application, and again for the same individuals for the last available year of data, the year prior
to the surveys.17 The change in this differential givesan estimate of the drop in earnings that the
applicant experiences,with the nnn.applicant 'control' group allowing me to net out growth that
could he attrihuted to either economy-wide or cohort-wide earnings growth. The change in the
log differential ranged from .807 in the 1972 survey to .795 in the 1978 survey, implying a drop in
earnings for those who continue to work of abont 55%50
The demographicevidence reported in Table 2 gives the clear impression that those men who
apply for DI benefits (beneficiariesand rejected applicants alike) tend to be less educated and are
more likely to be non-white than the comparablyaged non-applicants. This finding is really not
very surprising. The less educated and non-whites tend to be in worse health19 and to be in more
demanding jobs than the overall population.25 Lastly, the relative rewards for returning to work
wili be smaller for these groups.
The 1972 and 1978 surveys contain both the respondents' ownassessmentof the degreeto which
health limits their ability to work and their responses to other more specific questions about their
health. The vast majority of the rejected applicants report important health limitations on their
ability to work. Over 50% report that health preventsthem from workingaltogether (I will refer to
this group as the severely disabled), while roughly 90% report that their health at least limits the
kind or amount ofwork they can perform (I will refer to this group as the partially disabled). Over
85% report being incapable of either doing any work or of doing the same kind of work they did
before their health limitation began. While there are many reasons to be suspicious of self-reported

work limitations,2' reports of specific conditions should he considerablyless subjective. Table 2
shows that rejected applicants are substantially more likely to report suffering from any of a variety

of specific conditions than are their able-bodiedcounterparts.22
Independent evidenceon the work capacityof rejected DI applicants is also available. In a 1969
study conductedfor the Social Security Administrationby SandNagi, independentpanels evaluated
the work potential of a sample of DI applicants.23 Thesepanels included doctors, psychologists,and
occupational and vocational counselors. They were authorized to enter the homes of applicants,
to conduct any of a variety of tests, and to collect any information they felt relevant to the study
case. In short, it is hard to imagine having available any more reliable informationon a person's
health or work capacity.
The Nagi teams evaluated applicants on sn eight-pointscale ranging from "fit for work under
normal conditions" to "not fit for work." Table 3 shows the Nagi study's eight point evaluations of
work capacity for both SSA allowances and denials. According to these evaluations, many rejected
applicants do suffer substantial health limitations. Of the population denied benefits, 35.6% were
found incapable of any work, and another 12.3% were only capable of work at home or in sheltered
environments. Only 33.7% were capable of work under normal conditions. The proportion of the
rejected applicants that the Nagi teams determined were incapable of work lines up very closely
with the proportion we found who do not, in fact, work. Thus it seems natural to infer both that
the rejected applicants are in fact in poor health, and that this is the reason they do not go hack

to work.
If the majority of those disability insurance applicants who have been denied benefits do not
return to regular work, it is quite natural to wonderhow they survive. Table 4 provides a partial
answer to this question. Using the Social Security surveys, I tabulated sources of income for
rejected DI applicants. I report the proportion of men receiving each kind of income together
with the average amount received (for those whodid receiveincome from the source). These were
computed separately according to whether the respondent worked at all during the year prior to
the survey, and also included tabulations on DI beneficiaries and on the overall population. Table
4 shows that a large number of rejected applicants,especiallythose whodo not go back to work, do

Tbene last tabulations are probably bent thought of as one tailed-tents. Were we to have found only a small

their weakattachment to the labor force reflected health. Finding what we do in compatible with both a otory
that emphasizes the importance of poor health in explaining the behavior of rejected applicants and one that
emphasiom the role of poor health as a jnntiflcation for early retirement.

receive some kind of public income maintenance, mostly from programs that target the disabled.
The availability of alternative sources of income helps explain whymore of these individuals do not

return to work. What is crucial for using rejected applicants as a control group, however, is the
question of whether the sources of income available to the rejected applicants would be available
for beneficiarieswere they not on Dl. What we see is that for most sources of non-labor income,
the DI beneficiaries are at least as likely to be receiving some as are the rejected applicants. The
major exceptions to this pattern are the state-run welfare programs (e.g. Aid to the Permanently
and Totally Disabled (APTD), SupplementarySecurity Income(SSI), and General Assistance),but
these are, to a large extent, substitutes for DI, and there is no reasonto believethat DI beneficiaries
would be any less likely to be eligible for these programs than are the rejected applicants.24
The numbers reported in Table 2 are comparableto those reported on a number of occasions by
staff researchersfor the Social Security Administration.tm The most recent exampleis a 1976 study
where Ralph Treitel used administrativerecords to follow up applicants initially denied benefits in
1967Y6 Of the men who had been denied benefits on medical grounds, 13.8% had died by 1973.
(This comparesto roughly 7% for the comparablyaged population.)27Another 16.1% had reached
retirement age, and only 36.2% had any Social Securityearnings the previous year. Of those with
earnings, only 52% had earnings above $3600 (median Social Security earnings in 1972 for prime
aged men were above $9000).25 Furthermore, 39.7% of the rejected applicants had not worked at
all in the four years after having been denied benefits, and only 24.1% had worked for as much
as three-quarters of the time. For men under 50, the picture was only slightly better. By 1973,
8.0% of these men had died (as compared to 2.4% for the population29).Thus mortality rates for
the rejected applicants were once again more than twice that for the comparablyaged population.
Only 51.7% had any Social Security eamings the previous year, 25.9% had not worked at all in
the four years after they were denied benefits, and only 33.0% had worked for as much as three
quarters of the time.

See the preceding footnote for a devcriptioo of how the 2.4% was calcslstecl.

In someways, Treitel's data are better tban tbe surveysused for Table 2. His samples are much
larger (75,633 cases). Sincethey come from administrativerecords there is no need to worry about
self-reportingbiases. Moreover, he could follow his cohort for a full five years. The impressionwe
draw from his tabulations is, if anything, stronger than what cast be derived from my own. Fewer
men are working, they earn less, and both of these effectsappear to be permanent. These differences
can be largely accounted for by the fact that by using retrospective information,I eliminate those
whowere the worst off — those who had died by the survey year. Of those still alive and of working
age in Treitel's sample, 46.8% worked some time during 1972. This number is in line with the
numbers I arrived at for the proportion of rejected applicants who worked some time during the
year prior to the survey (45% in 1972, 40.4% in 1978).
Relying either on the disability surveys or on Treitel's tabulations, the conclusion is that less
than 50% of the rejected DI applicants work. As long as the Social Security Administrationscreening procedures are even partially effective, this finding should be viewed as a conservativeupper
bound on the proportion of DI beneficiaries whowould work were they not receivingDI. While there
has been much concern over the ambiguityand arbitrariness of the Social Security Administration's
medical screenings, no one has seriously suggested that it is completely ineffective. The tabulations
reported in Table 2 show that beneficiaries are more likely to report themselves severely disabled
and are more likely to claim that they suffer from any of a variety of specific conditions than are
the rejected applicants. The Nagi results reported in Tahle 4 show DI beneficiaries twice as likely
to be incapable of regular work as are their rejected counterparts. The hardest evidence on the
effectiveness of DI screening comes from mortality data. For example, Treitel (1976) reports that
even adjusting for age, applicants arcepted onto DI were more than twice as likely to die within
five years after their initial determinations as those rejected.ae Viewed together, these pieces of
evidence certalnly seem to suggest that DI beneficiaries are in substantially worse health than are
the rejected applicants.
The employmentrate of rejected applicants as an spper bound on the potential employment
rate of beneficiaries has implicationsfor how much of the drop in participation rates DI can explain.
Some illustrative calculations will clarify this point. In 1980, 4.2% of the total male population
between the ages of 45 and 54 was on DI. According to the 1978 survey, 50% of the rejected
applicants in that age range were in the labor force. Thus we calculate that in 1978 DI was
removingless than 50% of 4.2%, or 2.1% of the men this age from the labor force. This 2.1% is
40% of the 5.3 percentage point drop in participation that this age group experienced. For 55 to
64 year olds we find a similar pattern. The 1978 survey shows that 34% of rejected applicants in

Tbis 3.8% is roughly25% of the 15.8 percentage point drop that actually occurred.
Tbe data on rejected applicants suggest that most Dl applicants do, in fact, suffer impairments
that limit their ahility to work. While my evidence does suggest that a portion of DI applicants
are quite capable of gainful employment and return to jobs where they earn as much as they did
prior to their application, the vast majority either do not work or have earnings well below their
pre-disability levels. Under the conservativeassumption that DI beneficiaries, in the absence of DI,
would work no more than rejected applicants do, DI cannot be responsible for most of the decline
in the labor force participation rates of older working-agemen.

2. Some Objections
So far I have been maintaining that what accounts for the low earnings and labor force attachment of rejected applicants is health limitations on their ability to work. Along with this
interpretation it is quite natural to presume that the rejected applicants do better in the labor
market than would beneficiaries, were the latter not receivingDI benefits.
There are, however, two alternativeexplanations for the weak labor force attachment of rejected
DI applicants. One possibility is that the behavior of rejected applicants does not reflect what it
wouldhave been were they neverto have applied for DI benefits. Another is that rejected applicants
differ from beneficiaries in characteristics unrelated to health, and that it is these characteristics
that lead to the low labor force attachment of this group. Either of these two possibilitiesposes a
potential problem for my maintained hypothesis that rejected applicants are a conservativecontrol
group for beneficiaries. The next two subsectionsdiscuss each of these possibilitiesin turn.
A. The Effect of the Applicntion Decision on Employment.
There are a variety of reasons to think that the behavior of rejected DI applicants may not
be comparable to what it would have been had they not applied for Dl benefits. One reason
might be that somerejected applicants still hope to qualify. Some do appeal their initial decisions
while others simply re-apply. While this rationale might explain why some rejected applicants do
not return to work, it is harder to see how it could explain the low earnings of those who do.

Furthermore, if this were a major part of what was going on, we would expect that over time,
rejected applicants would return to work. however, there is no evidence of this effect in either
my own or Treitel's data. Treitel actually has the data to do separate tahnlations for men that
neither appealed nor found their way onto DI by re-applying. The proportion among this group
who work in only slightly higher than it is for rejected applicants as a whole (40.9% of those that
had not appealed their decisions and 41.9% of those who had neither appealed their decisions nor
sucressinllyreapphied worked sonic time during 1972. These fignres compare to the overall figure
of 36.2%).

B. AlternativeFactors InfluencingReemploymentProspects ofRejectedApplicants.
There are a large number of reasons why older working.age men might leave the labor force.
Some presumably do leave for poor health, but others may simply be tired of workingor face poor
labor market prospects. (For convenience, I will refer to this second 'group'as poorly motivated.)
Such men might find DI an attractive alternative and apply for benefits. Applicants for DI would
therefore include those who are poorlymotivated as well as those in poor health.
This situation does not, in and of itself, invalidate my conclusion that rejected applicants are

factors affectingthe behaviorof rejected applicantscould also be expected to influencebeneficiaries
(were they not receiving benefits). A problem could arise in a situation where the Social Security
examiners accepted the disabled but rejected the poorly motivated. In this situation, beneficiaries
would tend to be in poor health but well motivated, and rejected applicants would tend to be in
good health but poorly motivated. If, in addition, the poorly motivated were less likely to work
than those in poor health, then we would conclude that the labor force attachment of rejected
applicants understates the labor force potential of beneficiaries.
There is little reason to believe that among the eligible population, the Social Security examiners take explicit account of anything other than health and work capacity.34 Still, if health
and motivation ace negativelycorrelatedamongst the applicant population, selectionbased on poor
health would also imply selectionin favor of the highly motivated. While health and motivation are
probably not negatively correlated in the overall population, the self-selection of applicants could
generate this kind of correlation in the applicant pool.
To see this more concretely, imaginethat there are two kinds of men whoapply for DI benefits:
those who are in poor health (the disabled) and those that are poorly motivated (the lazy). In
this situation, knowing that an applicant is not in poor health implies that he must be lazy (and
vice versa). There would, therefore, be a negative correlation between these two factors within
the applicant population. Now imagine that the medical screening is effective, thus permitting the
disabled to pass the medical screening to get onto DI while the lazy do not. Effective screening
implies that the rejected applicants are lazy but not disabled,while the beneficiaries ace disabled but
not lazy. Regardlessof whetherthere are actually two distinct populations, as long as both health
and other factors such as motivation affect a man's decision to apply for DI benefits, knowing that
an applicant is in relativelygood health raises the odds that he is poorly motivated. The correlation
between health and motivation will tend to be less positive or more negativeamongst the applicant
pool than it is among the overallpopulation.
To get somenotion of the merits of the above scenario, we can use the 1972 and 1978
surveys
to identify non-health differences between the rejected applicants and beneficiaries. Table 2 has
already confirmedthat, whileapplicants tend to have less education and are less likely to be white
than non-applicants, the differences between rejected applicants and beneficiaries on these scores
are small.
The Social Security earnings history allows us to compare the pre-disability earnings and
employment experience of rejected applicants and beneficiaries. The typical Dl beneficiary had
earned substantially less than had other men his age even before applying for benefits (37% lower
in 1972 and 24% lower in 1978). The difference between beneficiaries and rejected applicants was,

Some illustrative calculationswill give an indiration of the potential magnitude of this problem.
Using tbe 1972 survey, I follow Parsons as closely as possible. I restrict my attention to men who
worked for at least one quarter in covered employment during 1966 and who were between the
ages of 48 and 62 in 1972. For this sample I compute both average earnings (through 1966) and
potential disability benefits (the, so called PL4), using the schedule applicable as of 1966.36 I then
estimate non.employmentprobabilities as a function of the log of the replacement ratio, age and
different health indicators.37

with respect to the replacementratio ranging hetween .24 and .72. These estimates are remarkably
close to Parsons' .63.. In the 4th through 6th columns I restrict my sample to those who have
never applied for DI benefits. The estimated coefficients move little, with two out of three of the
estimated elasticities rising somewhat?8 For this population of non-applicants I have estimated
effects very close to those Parsons does despite the fart that in this case there can be no possible
causal connectionbetween high benefit levels and labor force withdrawal. While these estimates do
not prove that DI had little impact on participation rates, they do seem to suggest that estimates
using this kind of specificationshould not he interpreted causally.
Studies that focus on either applications or program participation, rather than on labor force
participation, typically obtain results that imply much smaller disincentive effects than those of
Parsons. Leonard (1979), using someof the same data that I do, estimates that for 45 to 54 yearold men a 10% increase in benefits will induce a 3.5% increase in the number of Di beneficiaries.
While an elasticity of DI participation with respect to benefit levels of .35 looks quite close to the
.63 elasticity that Parsons reports, what this means in terms of labor force participation depends
on how an impact on program participation translates into an impart on labor force participation.
If it is assumed that each of the beneficiaries attracted by the higher benefits would have been
workingwere they not receivingDI benefits, then each new beneficiarymeans one less labor force
participant. But to convert this one-for-one change in the number of labor force participants into
an elasticity, it is necessary to take into account the fact that there are more than twice as many
older men out of the labor force as there are men the same age on Dl. Even assuming that all

of those who were attracted to DI by higher benefits would have otherwise been working, the .35
elasticity of program partiripation with respect to benefit levels implies something less than a .16
elasticity of labor force non-participation with respect to benefit levels.39 Leonard's results thus
seem to imply non-participation elasticities of at most one quarter of those of Parsons.40

force, If, as seems likely, the new applicants would be less likely than the earlier ones to pass the
medical screening,this 25 should be decreased correspondingly.Either this 2.5 or Leonard's 1.6 is
substantially below Parsons' 6.3.
To summarire, no one has disputed the claim that there are disincentives and social costs
associated with DI. The questions are about magnitudes. Data on rejected applicants give estimates of magnitudes in line with much other research in this area. The real contrast is with
the cross-sectional econometric estimates, but there are independent reasons to believe that these
overestimatetrue effects.

4. The Historical Record
So far I have argued that data on rejecteddisability insurance applicants suggest that no more
than half of DI beneficiaries would work were it not for DI, and, thus, that DI can account for no
more than 50% of the postwar drop in the participation rates of older men. Yet if these claims
are valid, how is it possible to account for the trends in labor force participation and program
on DI have been doing before DI
growth? What would the counterparts of those men currently
existed? If DI cannot account for the drop in participation, what doss? What accounts for the
dramatic growth in DI that occurred during the 1960's and 1970's? Without plausibleanswers to
these qsestions the foregoing asalysis may appear unconvincing. In this section I will addressthese
broader issues.

If those currently receivingdisability benefits are truly incapable of gainful employmentwe
should expect to find during the 1950's and 1960's—beforethe major growth of DI—a sirable pro-

portion of men reporting themselves disabled and either out of work or not in regular employment.
On the other hand, if many of those currently receiving disability benefits are perfectly capable of
work, we wouldexpect to find many of their counterparts workingin the period before DI existed.
In this case we would expect to find many fewer men reporting themselves disabled and out of work
in the period before tbe expansion of DI. Two surveys of the disabled during the early postwar
years suggest the truth is closer to the former than the latter pattem.
In September 1949 two relevant questions were included in the Current Population Survey:
First of all, I wouldlike to check persons (in this household) who aren't able to
do their regular work or other duties today because of illness or disability.
Is there anyone else (in the household) under 65 years old with a physical or
mental condition that allows him to work only occaaionai.ly or not at all?
For each person identified as disabled, the enumerator asked the duration of the disabllity.
3.7% of men 45 to 54 years old and 8.0% of men 55 to 64 years old had been disabled for at least 6
months. Were their counterparts on DI 30 years later, they would have accounted for roughly 75%
of the older men receiving benefits. Not all in this group were out of work (78.4%were), nor would
all of them have qualified on technical grounds. (Over 96% of these men had been working at the
time that they became disabled, so it can be presumed that many wouldhave had a sufficient work
history to qualify for DI.)42 Dependingon exartly what assumptions are made about the portion of
the 1949 disabled who would have counterparts currentlyon DI, it is probably advisable to adjust
the 75% downwardsomewhat. Still, what these numbers showis that before DI existed there was a
stock of older men who were both disabled and out of work. Their counterparts should constitute
a substantial portion of those currently receiving DI benefits.
In 1966 the SocialSecurity Administrationsurveyed the disabled.43 By that year DI had grown
to about one-half of its maximum size with 2.0% of 45 to 54 year old men and 5.8% of 55 to 64 year
old men receivingbenefits(in 1979 4.3% of 45 to 54 year old men and 11.5% of 55 to 64 year old men
received benefits). Accordingto the survey36.4% of 45 to 54 year old and 55.1% of the 55 to 64 year
old severely disabled men were receiving some kind of Social Security Benefits.44 Another 46.3% of
the severely disabled 45 to 54 year olds and 32.7% of the severely disabled 55 to 64 year olds had

the 61% who were married (spouse present) almost half had wives that worked. Finally, although
few of these men worked full-year or full-time, a fairly large number did work at least part-time.
As an indication of the relative importance of these different sources of income, for married
men, the men themselvescontributed on the average about 17% of the family's incomes, their wives
contributed about 29% and 41% came from public income maintenance. Median yearly family
income for this group amounted to $2735. (The Current Population Survey shows the median
family income for comparably aged married men that year was $8044.)" For unmarried men the
men themselves contributed 21% of the total, while public income maintenance contributed 71%.
Median family income for this group was $1212. (Medianincome for 45 to 64 year old single men

in 1965 was

$5200.)

The simple historical trends presented in the introduction to this paper appeared to suggest
that DI was drawing from a population which would otherwise have been gainfully employed. A
closerlook at the historicalrecord suggeststhat DI was, toalarge extent, drawingfrom a population
already out of work. What DI did was to substitute a federal earningsrelated program for the more
meager state run programs that already existed."
The historical record is quite consistentwith the previously presented informationon rejected

DI applicants, which found that less than 50% of DI beneficiaries would work were they not receiving
benefits. This analysis indicates that, before Dl existed or before it had grown to its present size,
there was a sizable population of men both disabled and out of work. In 1949, for example, 5.6%
of all males 45 to 64 years of age reported themselves disabled. Assuming that two thirds of the
counterparts of the 5.6% would he on DI 30 years later, this population could therefore account
for 50% of the current DI population.54 Similarly, in 1966 there seemed to he a population of men
identified as severely disabled, but who had not applied for DI benefits. This population was of
comparablesize to the one already receivingbenefits. Thus it seems likely that much of the growth
of DI that occurred between 1966 and 1979 camefrom this population.55
This number is basedno the author's tabolatiosu ssisg the March lafifi Correst Popolation Survey Tape.

effects whose magnitudes are very much in line with those
suggested by the evidence presented
in this paper. In section 4 1 turned my attention to the historical record. Closer examination of
available postwar data suggested that DI has polled a substantial nomber of its
beneficiaries from
a population that would have been out of work regardless of the availabilityof DI.

Data on rejected DI applicants together with available historicalinformationpresent a consis-

tent picture. It is a picture that suggests that most of those on DI suffer from substantial health
limitations ou their ability to work, and that less than half wouldbe working even in the absenceof
DI. Thoughthere are reasonsto question the interpretations of this informationthat I have
favored,
it does seem to provide direct evidence on the potential disincentive effectsofDI, and should cast
doubt on the large estimated effects drawnfrom cross-sectional studies.
Though I have been arguing that, by and large, DI is successfully targeting its intended beneficiaries, this is a far cry from saying that the program is beyond improvement. None of the above
evidencecan answer questionsabout what, on the margin, wouldbe the precise impact of changing
benefit levels or screeningstringency on the composition of either the applicant or beneficiary
pools.
Answeringsuch policy-relevantquestions clearly requires a kind of data we simply do not have. In
fact, it is hard to imagine that we could possibly get credible answers to these particular
questions
in the absenceof artual social experiments.53

The Social SecurityDisabilitytnsurance Program providesearly retirementbenefitsfor
working-I
aged men and women who are found to be incapable of gainful employment. To be eligible an
individual must have worked in 'covered' employmentfor 5 of the 10 years preceding the onset of
his or her disability.' The major groups excluded by this provision are governmentworkers who
have their own programs and individuals who have always shown a weak attachment to the
labor
force. Until 1974 this latter group had to rely on state-run and financed
general assistanceor on
Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled. Since 1974 they have been

Social Security Disability and Retirement benefits are calculated in the same way. Monthly
benefits rise as a function of past earnings, but less than proportionately. Since the mid 1970's the
typical worker in Isos or her 50's could expect to have about 60% of alter tax earnings replaced.
In contrast, a worker earning the maximum taxable amount could expect to have about 40% of
those earnings replaced, while a worker earning close to the minimum wage would get something
over 70% of his or her earnings replaced. Dependents of beneficiaries also receive benefits usually
amounting to 50% of those of the primary beneficiary. These dependents' benefits can easily push

care. DI beneficiaries often also qualify for other transfer income, including Veterans Benefits,
Workers' Compensationand Government Disability. In some cases (e.g. Workers Compensationor
Government Disability benefits), there are offsets built in so that if total transfer income exceeds
80% of a beneficiary'spre-disabilityearnings SSDI benefits are reduced accordingly;in other cases
(e.g. for Veterans' Benefits) there are no such provisions.4 As an indication of the extent of these
overlaps, the 1978 Survey of Disability and Work shows more than 50% of DI beneficiaries receiving some other kind of transfer income, with the average amount for those receivingsome almost
matching average DI benefits.
The statutory definition of disability requires that the worker moat be unable "to engage in
any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinablephysical for mental impairment...of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, consirlering
his age, education and work experience,engage in nssp(emphasis added) substantial gainful work."5

in fact, be disabled accordingto the legal definition of the term. This concern was magnified by a
number of phenomena turned up by congressional committees. Wide discrepancies were discovered
between the proportion of claimants denied benefits both across states and across AU's. There
was an almost twofold difference between the most liberal and the most
stringent states in terms
of the proportion denied benefits.14 Discrepancies across AU's was even more dramatic, with
some judges almost never reversingthe initial determination while others usually would.'1
Finally
a 1981 GAO report suggested, based on the medical reexamination of random sample 3154 DI
beneficiaries, that as many as 20% of the DI beneficiaries might not be entitled to benefits.
In 1980 Congresspassed legislation designed to tighten administrative control over DI. There
were several major features of the law'6:
1. The Social Security Administration had always reserved the right to review initial state
DDS determinations before they were transmitted to the applicant, but during the 1970's were
reviewingonly 5% of cases. The 1980 amendmentsrequired that they review a full two-thirds of
the successful applications. Moreover, to enforce some kind of administrative control over AU's
the secretary of IIHS was empowered to appeal AU rulings that were favorable to the applicant.
2. Priorto 1980 the law provided for disability determinations to be performedby State agencies under an agreement negotiated by the State and the Secretaryof lIDS. The 1980 amendments
required that disability determinations be made by Stateagencies according to regulations of tl,e
Secretary. It also required the Secretary to issues regulations specifying performance standards
to be followed in performing the disability determhlations. The provision further provided that

was started again in 1986. The 1984 legislation shiftedthe burden ofproof onto the Social
Serurity
Administration to show that beneficiaries'health had improved
sufficiently to allow them to return
to work. It also called for a moratorium on the reevaluationsof the most troublesome
cases, those
that involved mental impairments and those that involved pain, until sensible
guidelinescould be
developedfor these cases. Finally it provided that an individuals' benefits should be continued
pending appeal. The effectsof this new legislation have yet to be felt.tt
Given the controversy over DI and the screenings used to determine an
individuals' initial
and continued eligibility, it makes sense to review what is known about the
reliability of disability
determinations. A number of much- publicized GAO reports have
suggested that many of those
on the DI rolls are in fact able-bodied. I will argue that a careful look at the available evidence
suggests a quite different picture.
Both Congressand the Social Security Administration have been concernedabout the reliability of DI screening since tbe program's inception and, as a reault have commissioned a variety
of studies of the issue. Different studies have bad somewhat different
focuses. A 1980 study by
Sal Gallichio and Barry Bye (GB) of the Social Security's Office of Research and Statistics
examined the degree of consistencyin initial decisions across states. They
arranged for pairs of teams
acrosseight states (chosento be representative) to evaluate a random sample of 504 recent claims.
The probability of disagreement within state' ranged from 5.1% to 16.8%
averaging 12.0%. The
probability of disagreementbetween states ranged from 11.0% to 21.5% with an average of 15.6%.
Two studies have examined the eligibility of those already on the DI roles. A 1971
study by
Robert Smith and Abraham Lilienfeld (SL) includedre-evaluationsby the Social
Security Administration of a sample of over 1000 applicants from Baltimore. Applicants were re-aasesed under the
same eligibility requirements and medical standards and non-medical guides as those used in the
initial determination. At the time of the reassessment, the disabilityexaminers were instructed to
evaluate each case by using current medical data, the up-to-date earnings record and the information reported by the applicant on the interview schedule as to current health and work status. The
applicant's disability status from the previous determination was excluded from considerationin
the reassessment. 19.5% of those whose applications were accepted were determinesias
ineligible on
the re-assessmentwhereas 23.6% of thoseoriginally denied benefits were deternsinedto be
eligible.
A second study was conducted by the Social Security Administeation during 1979 and 1980.
The Social Security Administration selected over 3000 cases that were representative of the Dl
population as of April 1979, collected medical evidence, and in some cases interviewedbeneficiaries about their impairments. Based on this evidence, Social Security Asinsinistration exansisers
deternsinesl that about 20% slid not meet current eligibility standards.

is precisely the kind of magnitude we would expect
given the

The evidence on the reliability and validity of the medical screening required to qualify for
DI benefitsis quite consistent. Roughly 20% of DI beneficiaries were judged ineligible for benefits.
This seems to have been true for beneficiaries admitted during the 1960's as well as for beneficiaries
admitted during the 1970's. Since even with exactly the same evidence different determination
teams seem to disagree 15% of the time, this 20% figure would seem to be more a reflection of
ambiguities in the initial determination than dramatic but unnoticed recoveries among beneficiaries.
Moreover, Nagi's evidence would suggest that many of the 20%, even if these is some ambiguity
about whether they meet the criteria used to establish eligibility for DI, do, in fact, suffer major
impairments. The qualitative evidence would suggest that discrepancies arise not because there is
muchquestionabouttheevidence but becausethereare disagreementsover whether an impalcment
is of sufficient severity to qualify the claimant as legally disabled. While there may be a social cost
involved in the ambiguity of such decisions the available evidence suggests quite clearly that the
vast majority of DI beneficiaries suffer severe health limitations.
With generous benefits and an only very imperfect screening mechanism it would seem likely
that SSDI would have had at least some disincentive effects. At the same time, I think that the
very large disincentive effects that have been suggested in published work on the subject are much
too large to be believable. In this paper I present simple direct evidence that does suggest that
there have been some disincentive effects but suggestmagnitudes more in line with those suggested
by the clinical and legal research mentioned in this appendix.
