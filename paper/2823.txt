MONEY, CREDIT, AND BUSINESS FLUCTUATIONS

ABSTRACT

This paper provides a critique of standard theories of money, in
particular those based on money as a medium of exchange.
tant hecause of the relationship between money and credit.

Money is imporThe process of

judging credit worthiness, in which banks play a central role, involves the
collection and processing of information.

Like many other economic activ-

ities involving information, these processes are not well described by means
of standard production functions.

Changes in economic circumstances can have

marked effects on the relevance of previously accumulated information and
accordingly on the supply of credit.

Changes in the availability of credit

may have marked effects on the level of economic activity, while changes in
real interest rates seem to play a relatively minor role in economic fluctuations.
This alternative view has a number of implications for policy, both at
the macro-economic

level (for instance, on the role of monetary policy for

stabilization purposes and the choice of targets) and at the micro-economic
level -

4Several other versions of the irrelevance theorem, paralleling the
various versions of the Modigliani-Miller theorem, were established, e.g. by
Wallace.
These required somewhat more stringent conditions, for instance,
the existence of a complete set of securities markets.
Earlier, simpler versions of public irrelevance theorems, in which
there was no uncertainty, were popularized by Barro [1974] , though similar
results were proven several years earlier in an unpublished paper by Robert
Hall [1967], and Buchanan attributes the idea to Ricardo (hence the popular
characterization of the result as the Barro-Ricardo proposition.)

while it assumes that the government may control the nominal money supply,
it does not control the real money supply.

If our objective is to explain why the economy adjusts more in

terms of quantities than prices, we have to look elsewhere.

As we have observed, our theory provides an explanation of the relative
rigidity of prices as well.

For if firms are risk averse (as they will be,

will be increased in indifferent circumstances--will have real effects,

implications of our theory.

Accordingly, the incidence of the corporation tax may depend on average tax

3.

Stabilization Policy

We have noted the importance of equity and credit rationing in business
fluctuations. An effective stabilization policy of the government should be
directed at overcoming the limitations of this rationing.
