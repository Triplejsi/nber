MONEY STOCK TARGETING, BASE DRIFT AND
PRICE-LEVEL PREDICTABILITY:
LESSONS FROM THE U.K. EXPERIENCE
ABSTRACT

It is controversial

whether money stock targeting without base

drift (i.e. following a trend—stationarygrowth path) makes the price
level more predictable in the presence of permanent shocks to money
demand.
critique,

Developing a procedure that does not run into the Lucas
and applying this procedure to the case of the U.K., the paper

finds that the variance of the trend inflation

rate in the U.K. would

have been reduced by more than one half if the Bank of England had not
allowed base drift.

During the 1970's, a number of countries attempted to control

reversed later and thus results in a permanent change in the money stock.
In other words, the money

base drift.
One popular criticism

greater uncertainty about the long—run behavior of the money

achieving long-run price stability.'

Indeed, if the arguments

shocks to the money demand function are trend stationary (so that the
real

money stock is trend stationary), the price level series has a unit

root if and only if the money stock series has a unit root.

In this

case, the price level is clearly less predictable over long periods under
base drift.

An interesting issue in this context

is why

a targeting policy whose

major goal is long—run price stability would allow base drift under these
circumstances.
