their pregnancy and birth.

Two recent and comprehensive

introduction

reports on infant health in the United

States both recommended that efforts be directed at reducing the number of
unintended or unwanted pregnancies.

(Institute of Medicine 1985; United

States Department of Health and Human Services 1986.)

The recommendation

was based on the proposed link between pregnancy planning, improved prena—
tal behavior, and favorable birth outcomes.

Specifically, women who choose

to become pregnant are apt to be better prepared emotionally and finan-

cially for the demands of pregnancy and childbearing.

Thus, they may be

more likely to avoid smoking, to seek out prenatal care earlier, and in
general to have a more heightened concern for the impact of their behavior

on the health of the fetus than women whose pregnancies were unwanted or
unintended.

As plausible as the recommendation appears, the evidence supporting
it is scarce.

A number of ecological analyses have documented a rela-

tionship between the use of family planning clinics and lower rates of
neonatal mortality (Grossman and Jacobowitz 1981; Joyce 1987a).

The

1987b).

Hon

The authors argue that the utilization of contraception and abor—

should be inversely related to the incidence of unwanted pregnancies

and births and positively related to the increased use of prenatal care and
other healthy behaviors.
At the individual level, there is some evidence that women who describe
their births as wanted begin prenatal care earlier and smoke less during
pregnancy

measure wantedness are substantial.

For instance, the timing of the

assessment can affect the response since a woman's attitude towards her
pregnancy and birth may be shaped by the experience

itself.1 Social cir-

cumstances can also affect a woman's response (Klerman and Jekel 1q84).
Teenagers and unmarried women may be more inclined to say that their
pregnanciem are unwanted because of the social stigmas attached to young
and out-of-wedlock childbearing.

Similarly, married women may feel inhi-

bited about describing their births as unwanted especially if their attitudes differ from those of their husbands.

Perhaps the most serious drawback

is that most research has focused on women whose pregnancies end in a live
birth.

This excludes all pregnancies that are terminated by induced abor-

tion.

In this study we investigate the impact of pregnancy resolution on the
demand for prenatal care by treating women who give birth as a selfselected sample from the population of pregnant women.

It is our hypothe-

sis that pregnant women who choose to give birth differ in unobserved ways

from similar women who voluntarily terminate their pregnancies.

Our approach can be described as a form of revealed preference in which

only those pregnancies that are voluntarily terminated are considered to be

In statistical terms, we treat women who give birth as a cen-

Such a framework

for prenatal care in which we control for the probability of giving birth
given a woman is pregnant.

We interpret this control as a measure of wan-

tedness.
Our study is based on a cohort of pregnant women who were residents of
New York City in 1984.

New York City is one of 14 vital registration areas

in the United States that submits induced abortion reports on individuals

to the National Center for Health Statistics

(NCHS).

By combining 1984

induced termination records with birth certificates in the same year, we

were able to generate a sample of pregnantwomen
within a twenty-month period.

Another reason for choosing New York City is

that the proportion of pregnancies (live births plus induced abortions)
that are terminated by induced abortion far exceeds national estimates.2
Thus, the use of induced abortion to distinguish between wanted and
unwanted pregnancies may be most effective in an area such as New York
where the widespread availability of abortion services makes it a readily
accessible option.

Finally, the racial and ethnic composition of the city

allows us to analyze black, white and Hispanic women separately.

The

impact of pregnancy resolution on the demand for prenatal care is likely to
differ by race and ethnicity given the marked variation in abortion rates

by these various groups.

Self—selection

Analytical and Statistical Framework

is a potential problem for researchers whenever the sub-

jects under study have not been randomly assigned.

In the economic litera-

ture the problem of self selection has received widespread attention
following the seminal work of Heckman (1976, 1979).

For example, the wages

of individuals who have completed a manpower training program are a biased
estimate of the wages individuals with similar characteristics would have
earned had they gone through the program, since the individuals enrolled in
the training program represent a self-selected sample from the population

of all potential trainees.

Put differently, those who seek out training

are likely to differ in unobserved ways (more ability or more ambition)
from those who do not.

Thus, the success of the training program at

of the
improving the earning power of graduates may be less a function
assotraining per se, and more related to the unmeasured characteristics
ciated with the trainees.
The notion of self-selection can be readily applied to prenatal behavior.

Contraception and abortion have provided women with the means to

control the number and timing of their pregnancies and births.
Consequently, women who choose to give birth represent a self-selected
sample from the population of pregnant women.

It is our hypothesis that

pregnant women who choose to give birth differ in unobserved ways

was 21 percent (Powell—Griner 1987; NCHS 1986). Although New York City has
a large minority population, the percent of all pregnancies to white
non-Hispanic women that were terminated by induced abortion was 45 percent
(see Table Al in the Appendix).

A charac-

teristic that distinguishes those who give birth from those who abort is
the wantedness of the pregnancy.
From a statistical standpoint, data on prenatal care can be characterized as a censored sample with an unobserved stochastic threshold.

Heckman's insight was that if selection into the sub-

sample was not randoe, then the expected value of the error term in
equation (1) was conditional on the regressors in equation (2).

This vir-

tually insured that the estimates of B1 obtained by ordinary least squares
would be biased given the correlation among the variables in

—6Heckman's solution was to treat the problem of selectivity bias as a

Following Trost (1981), we believe that 012 has a particularly useful

interpretation given the context of our model.

For instance, if

number of months a woman delays before initiating prenatal care, then women
whose pregnancies are more wanted, all else equal, should delay the initiation of prenatal care less than women whose pregnancies are less wanted.
Thus, a negative coefficient on lambda, (012 <

implies that, on average,

women with a greater than expected probability of not aborting (i.e.,

0),

have a less than expected delay in the initiation of prenatal care

In short, a negative and statistically significant coefficient

on lambda, is consistent with the interpretation that pregnancies that are
more wanted, delay the initiation of prenatal care less.
Although we have argued that the wantedness of a pregnancy distinguishes
women who abort from women who give birth, clearly caution is in order when
giving names to unmeasured variables.
cost of contraception

For example, a model in which the

is the underlying unobservable would generate the

same predictions as a model based on wantedness.

Specifically, a decrease

in contraceptive costs, all else constant, diminishes the probability of an
unintended pregnancy, and decreases the likelihood of aborting.

This

lowers optimal family size and raises the investments per child (Willis
1973).

On the other hand, some women will not abort a pregnancy on moral

grounds while others, adolescents in particular, choose the birthing option
because the direct and indirect costs of obtaining an abortion are too
high.

Thus, increases in the shadow price of abortion, increase optimal

family size and lessen the resources devoted to each child.

Finally,

advancements in prenatal diagnosis, such as amniocentesis and ultra
sonography, yield very detailed information as to the health of the fetus.
Although pregnancies that are terminated because of this information are
obviously unwanted, it is the health endowment of the fetus which is the
underlying causal factor.4

3The expected probability of aborting and the expected probability

of delay are based on F(X12B2) and X1B1 respectively.

Some yield predictions consistent with a wantedness

Trying to identify which is the dominant factor

would require a more elaborate model as well as more data.

We have empha-

sized the wantedness of a pregnancy because we feel it represents the most
straightforward

interpretation of the decision to abort or give birth.

We

acknowledge that some women who give birth describe their pregnancies as
unwanted.5

This means that the intensity of their subjective evaluation

was insufficient to overcome the disutility, or high costs, of an abortion.
Our choice of New York City should lessen the proportion of unwanted births

due to the inaccessibility of abortion services.6 Moreover,

if the propor-

tion of unwanted births is substantial, then the sign of the residual
covariance will be biased towards zero or even positive.7

The advantage of

using pregnancy resolution as an indicator or wantedness is that pregnancies which are voluntarily terminated are clearly unwanted and in New York
City, this represents a major portion of all pregnancies.

5Data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) indicate that
approximately 10 percent of cumulative births to ever-married women 15 to
44 in 1982 were described as unwanted. By race, 8 percent of white births
and 22 percent of black births were unwanted at the time of conception
(NCHS 1985).
6New York has a well-developed market of private and public abortion providers, an inexpensive system of mass transit, no parental notification laws
and New York State is one of only 14 states that funds abortions for
Medicaid eligible women. This explains in part why the proportion of
pregnancies (live births plus induced abortions) in New York City that are
terminated by induced abortion greatly exceeds national averages (see footnote 2).

Data and Estimation

Data on births and abortions are from New York City vital statistics

In that year there were approximately 105,000 singleton live births

and 89,000 induced abortion to New York City residents.

and induced abortions,

non-Hispanic adults (11,106), Hispanic adults (10,913), white non-Hispanic
teenagers (4,132), black non—Hispanic teenagers (12,437) and Hispanic
teenagers (8,266).

Our analysis is made possible because many of the

parental characteristics reported on the birth certificates are also
reported on the induced termination records.

Thus, by concatenating the

data sets we were able to specify an equation predicting the probability of
giving birth, given a woman was pregnant.

A similar concatenation has been

done by Powell-Griner and Trent (1987) and Joyce (1988) to study pregnancy
resolution.

were missing on the induced termination records, but between 3 and 6 percent were missing on the birth records.

To avoid altering the ratio of

the unknowns.

A similar problem existed with previous spontaneous and previous
induced abortions.

On the abortion certificates approximately one percent

of the records lacked data on previous induced abortions, but on the birth
certificates the percent missing ranged from a low of 6 percent for white
adolescents to a high of 21 percent for Hispanic adults.

For spontaneous

abortions approximately 3 percent of the abortion records lacked data but
again the birth records showed a range of 4 percent missing for white adolescents and 23 percent for Hispanic adults.

We excluded parity

equation is in essence a measure of parity.

However, we include parity, as

well as late spontaneous abortions, in the prenatal care equation because
they proxy experience with pregnancy and birth.

Yet, Medicaid

If the opportunity costs of giving birth

are lower for poor than nonpoor women, then Medicaid status could be positively related to the probability of giving birth (Joyce 1988).

With respect to the areal measures, we would expect the poverty rate to
be positively related to the probability of giving birth and positively
related to prenatal care delay.

The availability of abortion providers

should increase the probability of aborting by lowering the indirect Costs
of accessing a provider.

However, given New York City's well-developed

mass transit system, neighborhood health facilities may be a less relevant
availability measure.

The same may apply to prenatal care and family plan-

ning clinics.

We have also included demographic characteristics of the mother.

relationship between

Thus, we would expect greater schooling to

be negatively related to prenatal care delay (Cooney 1985; Rosenzweig and
Schultz 1983).
Among adolescents, however, a number of the demographic characteristics
may be endogenous.

For instance, education may determine the probability

of aborting, but the years of schooling completed could be affected by the
time spent pregnant.

Consequently, our measure of adolescent education is

a dichotomous variable that equals one if a teenager has completed at least
eight years of schooling and zero otherwise.

Such a low cutoff should

lessen the potential problems associated with reverse causality by capturing the adolescents whose educational problems existed before they
became pregnant.

A similar problem exists with marital status.

Vital statistics do not

indicate whether a teenager conceived inside or outside of marriage.

The

distinction is potentially important because the decision to give birth can
be made simultaneously with the decision to get married.

For example,

In particular, 93 percent of all black teenagers in New

York City who gave birth

in 1984

were unmarried (Table Al).

The figures

for whites and Hispanics are 50 and 75 percent respectively.

Thus, for

blacks the endogeneity of marital status in the birth probability equation
appears unimportant.

For Hispanics and whites we are unsure.

This caveat

should be kept in mind while interpreting the results.

Results

Maximum likelihood estimates of the birth probability equation and the
prenatal care demand equation are presented in Tables 2 and 3.

The results

for adolescents are in Table 2 and the results for adults are in Table 3.
Ordinary least squares estimates for the prenatal care demand equation are
shown in Table 4.
Regardless of age, race, or ethnicity, unmarried women and women with

at least one previous induced abortion are much less likely to give birth

12Nationally, 89 percent of all black live births and 43 percent of all
non-black live births to women 19 years and less were born out-of-wedlock.
The non—black category includes the vast majority of Hispanic births (NCHS
1986).

than their married or nulliparous counterparts.

This is expected because

unmarried women are more likely to have experienced an unintended or
mistimed pregnancy

(Pratt et al. 1984).

The result with respect to pre-

vious induced abortions is consistent with the interpretation that the
psychic costs of abortion are less for women who have aborted in the past.
Moreover, these women may be more willing to use abortion as a substitute
for contraception.
Women who are covered by Medicaid have a greater likelihood of giving
birth than women not supported by Medicaid.

Again, the finding pertains to

all women regardless of age, race, or ethnicity; however, Medicaid Status
has a much greater impact on the probability of giving birth among adolescents than it does for adults as measured by the magnitude of the coefficients.

The results for adolescents are similar to findings from a recent

study of adolescents in California

(Leibowitz, Eisen, and Chow 1986).

The

finding is notable because for women on Medicaid the out-of-pocket costs
for an abortion are zero.

One interpretation, therefore, is that economic

support for adolescent childbearing as provided by Medicaid and Welfare is
a disincentive for pregnant teenagers contemplating an abortion.

However,

as Joyce (1.988) argues, disentangling the economic causes of adolescent
pregnancy resolution from the emotional and psychological ones may require
more refined data.
Adult women with at least twelve years of schooling are more likely to
terminate a pregnancy than are women with between nine and eleven years of
schooling.

A similar finding has been reported before (Powell—Griner and

Trent 1987).

In addition, previous pregnancy loss among adult women is

Very young teens are more likely

Except for Hispanics, older adult women are more likely to abort than their

counterparts.

Among

the areal characteristics, the

availability of abortion providers

has the correct sign among whites but is statistically significant Only for
adults.

Among black adults the sign is positive and significant.

Hispanic

adolescents living in neighborhoods of relative poverty have a greater than
average propensity to give birth; white adults residing in similar neighborhoods are more likely to abort.

Differences among Hispanics with respect

to pregnancy resolution are pronounced.

Cubans have a greater likelihood

of aborting than do Puerto Ricans, but Mexicans as well as Central and
South Americans are more likely to carry to term.

One explanation for the

variations may be the degree of assimilation among the various groups
(Ortiz 1987; Schur, Bernstein and Berk 1987).
Ignoring the impact of pregnancy resolution, the results for the prenatal

care demand equations are in general conformity with the literature.

More educated adult women delay less irrespective of race and ethnicityl3

average poverty initiate care later than women from less poor neighborhoods
(Joyce 1987a).

Residence in a health district with a WIC center is asso-

ciated with less delay for black women while neighborhood prenatal care
clinics are positively related to delay among Hispanic adults.

Finally,

13The one exception is Hispanic adults in which women with less than 9
years of schooling delay approximately one-third of a month less than women
with between 9 and 11 years schooling.

except for Hispanic teenagers, women on Medicaid, or women with no health
insurance begin prenatal care later than women with some other form of
health insurance (Cooney 1985; General Accounting Office 1987).
Regarding other characteristics of the mother, older adult women delay
less,

while very young adolescents delay more than women in the respective

reference categories.

Unmarried women begin care later than married women

and the differential is greatest for whites and smallest for blacks.
Greater fertility is associated with greater delay and women who have
experienced a late spontaneous abortion respond no differently than women
with no such history.

Finally, as in the birth probability equation, there

is substantial variation among Hispanic subgroups.

Mexicans and Central

and South Americans are more likely to delay prenatal care relative to
Puerto Ricans; Cubans and other Hispanics delay less.

The presence of selectivity bias

is measured by the residual covariance

between equations (1) and (2).

We find evidence of selectivity bias

in the prenatal care demand equations for blacks and Hispanics irrespective

of age although for black adults, the null hypothesis of selectivity bias
can be rejected at only the .07 level.
among whites.

There is no evidence of such bias

Put differently, holding variations in demographic charac-

teristics, years of completed schooling, neighborhood poverty, and method

of finance, we find that black and Hispanic women who give birth represent
a non-random draw from the population of pregnant women.

The negative

indicates that, on average, the unobserved factors which raise

the probability of giving birth are positively correlated with the unobserved factors that decrease delay in the initiation of prenatal care.

our contention that by controlling for self—selection into the birth

sample, we are controlling, in part, for the wantedness of the pregnancy.
The negative covariance between the residuals in the pregnancy resolution
equation and the prenatal care demand equation is consistent with the
interpretation that pregnancies that are more wanted, delay the initiation
of prenatal care less
What these results imply about white pregnant women is that the decision to abort or give birth yields no information regarding the utilization
of prenatal care.

One explanation is that we have no equation predicting

the probability of becoming pregnant.

If whites use contraception more

often than blacks, and a number of sources indicate that they do, then the
selection process which reduces the proportion of unplanned pregnancies may
occur at an earlier point in the reproductive cycle among whites than it
does for blacks (Henshaw et al. 1985; Pratt et al. 1984; Stephen, Rindfuss
and Bean 1988).

Thus, by analyzing only pregnant women, as opposed to

Sexually active women, we are unable to incorporate the impact of contraception on prenatal behavior.
One means of gauging the magnitude of the selection effect on the initiation of prenatal care is to compare the observed mean number of months a
woman delays before initiating care to the expected mean delay of women who
aborted had they chosen to give birth.

Our first comparison is based on

Ignoring the results for whites, we find that

black teenagers who aborted would have delayed the initiation of care 1.5

As the results make clear, the expected differences in the ini-

Failure

to correct for self—selection can yield biased estimates as

shown by comparing the corrected with the uncorrected results in Table 4.
Among adults, for instance, the impact of completing high school on prenatal

care delay falls by 27 percent among black adults and 17 percent among

Hispanic adults.

For black adolescents the differential delay between

those on Medicaid and those with some other third party coverage falls 62
percent when self-selection is corrected.

However, in the case of Hispanic

adolescents the same differential increases by 41 percent.

The most drama-

tic change between the corrected and uncorrected estimates occurs for
unmarried women.

Among blacks of all ages the coefficients on out-of-

wedlock births more than doubles; for Hispanics the same coefficient
increases by more than 50 percent when corrected for self—selection.

The

results imply that unmarried women who do not voluntarily terminate their
pregnancies are at a greater risk of inadequate prenatal care than would be
predicted by direct correlational methods.

The results are especially

worrisome given the rise in out—of-wedlock childbearing among women of
Hispanic descent.

V.

Conclusion

In this study we have attempted to incorporate the information as to
how a pregnancy is resolved into the prenatal care demand equation.

We

accomplished this by treating women who give birth as a self-selected
sample from the population of pregnant women.

However, instead of simply

testing for selectivity bias, we have argued that the sign of the residual
covariance between the pregnancy resolution equation and the prenatal care

statistically significant manner from their counterparts

observed no such differences for whites.

We

We have speculated that black and

Hispanic women may substitute abortion for contraception more frequently
than white women.

As a result, the selection mechanism encouraged by abor-

tion has a greater impact on the prenatal behavior of minorities than it
has among whites.
It must be noted that New York City is a rather unique setting.

It has

a well-developed market of private and public providers, a state government
that continues to fund abortions for all Medicaid—eligible women, no parental notification laws with respect to minors, and a readily available

system of transportation.

At the same time the shadow price of contracep-

tion may be higher for minorities than for whites due to language barriers,
lower levels of schooling, and less access to private gynecological care.
Given these factors, the shadow price of abortion relative to contraception

may be lower for black and Hispanic women which would induce greater
substitution away from contraception towards abortion.
The upshot is that the results reported here may not generalize to
other areas where the shadow price of abortion is higher.

Consequently, an

would

be to conduct

analysis

in other

A higher shadow price

of abortion would either promote greater contraceptive use or result in

more hnwanted births.

The latter outcome is more likely for adolescents

and minorities given the frequency with which contraception is used by
these groups (Pratt et al. 1984).
Another area of future research is to examine the impact of pregnancy
resolution on birth outcomes.

Given the positive association between

the
early prenatal care and birth outcomes (Institute of Medicine 1985),
results reported here suggest an important indirect effect of pregnancy
resolution on birth outcomes through its impact on prenatal care.

However,

wantedness, as captured by pregnancy resolution, may improve other prenatal
behaviors (Weller, Eberstein and Bailey 1987).

The result could be a

direct effect on birth outcomes if pregnancies that are more wanted are
positively related to such hard to measure inputs as exercise, nutrition,
and lower levels of Stress.
