January 1989
WAGES, EMPLOYER COSTS, AND
EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE IN THE FIRM

ABSTRACT

In this paper

I use data fros a survey of firms to estimate the effects

of a firm's wage level on several measures of its hiring costs and the
characteristics and performance of its employees.

These measures include the

previous experience and current tenure of its employees; subjective
productivity scores for these employees; job vacancy rates; perceived ease of
hiring qualified workers for the firs; and hours spent hiring and training new
workers.

In doing so, I distinguish the case of high wages imposed on s firm

by unions from that in which the firm might be choosing its wage level in
order to maximize its profits.

I also provide some rough measures of the

extent to which firms offset their high wage costs in each case.
The results show generslly positive effects of firm wages on employee
experience and tenure as well as on subjective productivity scores.

The

firm's wsges generally have negative effects on job vacancy rates and positive
effects on the perceived ease of hiring qualified workers.

But a

much broader range of employee coats and productive characteristics or
outcomes among workers must be considered in order to correctly measure the
firm's ability to offset the costs of higher wages.

The magnitudes of the

effects must be considered as well in any reasonable attempt to gauge the
overall effects of wages on the firm.1°
In this paper

I

use data from a survey of firms to estimate the effects

of a firm's wages on its hiring costs and on the characteristics and
performance of its workers.

The focus on wages at the level of the firm (as

opposed to the industry or individual worker) will distinguish this work from
most previous studies on related issues.

This focus is consistent with the

evidence of wage differentials between firms for comparable workers of which
economists have long been aware (e.g. Dunlop (1957)) but which remain poorly
understood to date.
Several measures of worker quality and performance are used as outcomes
here.

These include:

the previous experience of the worker and his/her

tenure with the current employer; as well as subjective productivity scores as
gauged by the employer.

In addition,

I will consider job vacancy rates and

the perceived ease of hiring qualified workers to measure firm hiring
difficulties and how wages affect them.

Finally,

I will consider the number

of hours spent hiring and training these new employees by the employer. This
fairly comprehensive list of responses to firm wages will enable us to
approximately measure the degree to which high wage costs are offset by firms,
In a manner which has not been attempted to date.

2

In estimating fire—level

wage effects on these outcomes,

we will

distinguish between the effects of unions on wages, which are generally
imposed exogenously on the firm;11 and other determinants of wage levels which
might conceivably reflect firm choices.

These other determinants will include

industry and firm size, both of which have clearly been show to be associated
with long—run wage differences between firms.12 While this analysis is not an
explicit test of "Efficiency Wages" or any other theory of wage determination,
it should shed some light on the general notion of whether firms eight ever
find it in their

interest to pay high (relative to the market) wages.

Finally,

reductions in the frequency and duration of hiring will also reduce vacancy

Of

course, large offsets of wage costs in terms of training or expected
productivity should imply smaller ones in terms of vacancy rates and/or
turnover, as the net attractiveness of high—wage jobs for workers becomes
diminished.

questions in the 1982 Survey were the

One measure of employee performance that is available for these workers
is a subjective performance rating.

Employers were asked to score the most

would reflect no productivity and the latter the maximum feasible Output on

The question was asked for different points in the employee's tenure

employees on the same job so that relative comparisons could be made within
the firm.
As for more objective employee characteristics which might be

available in these data.

This assumption is no doubt questionable,

Furthermore, the exogeneity of industry and size with respect to the
wage as well as the observed outcomes might also be in doubt,

as wage

Empirical Results
In Table

we find means and standard deviations of several key

variables for the sample used here.

Two types of variables are considered:

those which reflect the characteristics and performance of the last worker
hired as well as those of the firm itself.
Several characteristics of workers and firma in the sample are
noteworthy. The starting wages are relatively low, reflecting a sample which
is predominantly comprised of high school workers in clerical, males, and
service jobs.

It is also a fairly young sample, averaging 8—9 total years of

If anything, these effects are generally negative (though not

significant). Thus, the larger quantity (and perhaps quality) of job
applicants received by high—wage firms requires them to spend more time on
screening, though some small economies of scale may emerge.23
The effects of firm wages on hours spent training new employees appear
in Table

3.

Separate equations appear for the three types of training

considered: formal, informal provided by management, and informal provided by
co—workers.
The results show generally negative effects of firm wages on all three
types of training,

though most effects are not significant. Only the effects

on hours of informal training provided by management are marginally
significant when we control for industry but not firm size.2

We also note

that the results here conflict somewhat with those presented by Barron et. al.
using the same data.25
Comparing Tables 2 and 3, we find that the magnitudes of the combined
negative training effects are generally larger than the positive effects on
total time spent hiring. While the costs associated with the different kinds
of time presumably differ, the results suggest that total time spent and costs
per new employee might be lower in high wage firms.

As for the elasticity of profit with respect to hiring costs, we aasume
that the hiring frequency is the inverse of expected job tenure and then use
our estimated wage effects on duration (Table 4) to calculate the effects of
wages on this rrequency.4

We use hours spent recruiting and training each

each new employee as a measure of the cost per

hire.35

But since an hour

spent by co—workers is presumably not as costly to the firm as an hour spent

by management personnel, we value each of the latter

at twice the value

of

each of the rormer.6 We also adjust time spent in formal training to account
for the fact that each hour of management time usually accommodates multiple
employees.37 The elasticity of total hiring coats is then obtained by
aggregating these effects and dividing by appropriately weighted means.
In Table 10 we present calculations of how a 10% rise in the firm's

wages will effect profits. We present separate estimates based on wage

While the crucial aamumption that observed wage effects on performance

the estimated magnitudes of the offset are consistent with various estimates

of the fraction of the union wage differential that is accounted

for by

personal characteristics (e.g., Mincer (1983), Freeman (1984)).

The evidence

of lower profits in the union sector despite higher experience and/or
productivity (Becker and Olson (1987)) is also consistent with the finding
here of a partial wage offset for unionized firms.

Finally, we note once

again that problems such as self—selection noted above are likely, if
anything, to bias these results in downward direction.

Conclusion

In

provide estimates of how the wage level of a firm

affects its hiring and training costs as well as the observed characteristics
and performance of its employees. This is done using data from a nationwide
survey of firms on the number of hours spent hiring and training their most
recent employee;

the characteristics (i.e., experience and job tenure) and

performance (subjective ratings)

of that employee; and vacancy rates

as well

as other measures of hiring difficulties. Separate estimates are provided for
union wage premia as opposed to those associated with firm size and/or
industry.
The results generally show that high—wage firms have lower hiring and
training costs as well as better employee performance. More specifically, we
find fewer hours spent on informal

NOTE:

In addition to the variables listed, the wage equations
contain the following controls: sex, education, occupation,
year, and site dummies, as well as hours of training.
All
but the year dummies also appear in the productivity score
equations.
