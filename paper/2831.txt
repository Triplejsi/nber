DISABILITY STATUS AS AN UNOBSERVABLE:
ESTIMATES FROM A STRUCTURAL MODEL

ABSTRACT

We propose an index of "true disability" by treating disability status as an unobservable phenomenon which is both causally related to a

number of exogenous characteristics of an individual and correlated with
a number of observed indicators of health, impairment and qualifications
for

empløyment.
First, we define true disability and distinguish it from related con-

cepts. We then discuss the importance of an objective and reliable
measure of disability for research on the determinants of behavior.

Next, we present the specification of our structural model for estimating

true disability as a latent variable. Finally, we report the results of
our estimation in a simple model of Labor force participation, and com-

pare the effect of using the constructed index and a self-reported disability measure on understanding the determinants of behavior and choice.

treats true disability status

as

2

which is both causally related to a variety of exogenous characteristics
of an individual and correlated with a variety of observed measures of
statuses and behaviors believed to be associated with true limits on

functioning. tn Section 1, we define what we mean by true disability,
and distinguish it from the related concepts of impairment, handicap, and

health Status. Section It discusses the importance of an objective and
reliable indicator of disability status for economic research, using the
studies of the work-effort response of individuals to available income

transfers to illustrate the problem. Section III presents the specification of our structural model for estimating true disability as a latent
variable, and Section IV presents the resulting estimates of the relevant

parameters. Finally, we compare our estimated index with a limited
self—reported measure in a simple model of labor force participation.

AND HEALTH STATUS

definition of disablement or impairment is necessary to identify

the population group we will label "disabled." Unfortunately, there is
no definition that

is

unambiguously the correct one, as the concept of

disability ultimately rests on a social judgment. Only when a person

falls

significantly below some threshold of deviation from the level of

physical or mental capacity required to engage in productive activities
within a social environment does society designate that person as suf-

ficiently atypical to be classified as disabled. However, no unambiguous
threshold has been identified and no uncontroversial indicator exists by
which to designate certain individuals as disabled or to indicate the

severity of their condition. All efforts to identify the disabled

population and to measure the

response to a survey question-

naire.

We seek a measure of disability appropriate for analyzing the nature

and

determinants of economic behavior.

Such a

measure should accurately

reflect the functional capabilities possessed by individuals relevant to

the aspect of behavior being studied. Henc., in analyzing individual
market work behavior, we define disability as a shortfall in the physical, mental, or emotional capability of an individual to adequately perform activities required for jobs which, on other grounds, he or she

would be qualified to hold. Consistent with this functional-capability
definition of disability, we define handicap to be a limitation of a physical, mental, or emotional sort which reduces, to varying degree,, one's
ability to perform the functions required for jobs as well

vities.

And we define impairment as a loss

or mental capacity which may lead

which affect an individual's success in the

limitations; and the require-

in terms of functional performance that are imposed by occupations

which an

individual

could normally bold, given his or her age,

education,

training, and skills (see Nagi, 1969).
With these definitions, an individual's true disability status ie
distinguishable from his or her health status, even though the b,o con-

cepts overlap. Health status concerns deviations

from

what is commonly

referred to as "good health," and typically involves impairments in one
or more of the body's systems.

Such

impairments are often short-term

4

(e.g., influenza); they may also be

long

ter,

or

termin.el. When they are

long term, they may or may not impair a person'. ability to perform the

functions required by his or her

occupation.

Thus, a severely disabled

person (e.g., a quadriplegic) may well be in good health. Conversely, a
person sick with influenza may have no job-prejudicing impairments. On
the other hand, a person bedridden with terminal cancer has poor health
status and is severely disabled.'

II. DISA3ILITT STATUS AND ECONOMIC IEIiAVIOR

An individual's disability (and health) status is relevant to a wide
variety of his or her economic choices—-e.g., marital status, fertility,

labor supply, occupation, and geographic location. Studies of the determinants of individual choice in all of these dimensions typically focus
on the

role

of economic and demographic factors in explaining observed

behavior. Success in obtaining unbiased estimates of the

role

played by

the economic variables requires accurate measures of control variables

which are also related to the observed status, including the

presence

and severity of handicaps.

Considet, for example, studies analyzing the decision to retire, most
of which have relied upon some for, of self-reported disability (or

health) status. Use of such self-report measures ha. been criticized on
grounds that

the

disability or health-statue responses offered by indivi-

duals both reflect and serve to justify decision, that have already been

made (see Parsons, 1982; Leonard, 1986). If, for stigma or other
reasons, respondents rationalize a decision not to work (e.g., retiring
before age 65) by citing work-related handicaps (or poor health) as

5

reasons,

the coefficient associated with the self-reported disability

status variable will be larger

than

that on a variable measuring true

disability status (Bound, 1987). As a corollary, the measured effect of
expected Labor

market income

on the decision to work will be a biased

estimate of its true effect.2

Parsons (1982) attempted to evaluate the problems associated with se
of a self—reported disability index in a single equation retirement/

replacement rate/disability transfer model. Comparing results from using
both a self-reported disability indicator and actual mortality experience
five years after the observed work status choice decision, be found that
the subsequent mortality measure was less closely related to the work
effort decision than was the contemporaneous self-reported measure, and
that the replacement rate was more significant when the mortality measure

was used. From this exercise, he concluded that use of self-reports of
disability in models of behavior tends to distort the measured effect of
economic variables.

The use of the subsequent mortality indicator to proxy true
disability status at the time of a work-retirement decision has been criticized by Havemaa and Wolfe (1984) as being arbitrary, a notoriously
weak proxy for work-impairing limitations (the factor which is likely to
be dominant in affecting work choices), and as excluding a wide variety

of handicaps that are unrelated to longevity. The results of Colvez and
Blanchet (1981), indicating the inverse movement over time of mortality
rates and the incidence of handicaps and impairments of a wide variety of
types cast further doubt on the appropriateness of this indicator in

6

studies of individual behavior. The puzzle is made even more

by the findings of recent studies indicating that Individual

complicated
self—reports

of health are stable over time, highly correlated with medical doctor
reports, and show no evidence of exaggeration of problems related to
being out of the work force (see Maddox and Douglass, 1973; Waldron,
Rerold, and Dunn, 1982; Ferraro, 1980 and Mossey and Shapiro, 1982).
Existing research findings, then, leave unresolved the choice of a

disability indicator for studies of individual economic behavior. Both

presented in

Section 1, a reliable measure of true disability ihould reflect thtee

phenomena: (I) functional limitations, (2) severity of handicap, and (3)
occupational capacity related to functional limitations. The index of
'true disability" proposed here treats disability status as an unobser-

vable condition, which is both causally

related to a number

of exogenous

individual characteristics and correlated with a number of observed indicators of individual health and disability, and with the availability of

employment for which one is qualified. This measure of "true disability"
is modelled jointly along with the individual's income from a system of

structural equations. Figure 1 presents a sketch of the model.

health increases with the wage rate.

In the model, true disability and income are also determined by a set of

exogenous variables. These include the socioeconomic characteristics of
the individual (education, age, race, urban-rural, sex, marital and
veteran status), personal habits, and the requirements and characteristics of

an individual's normal occupation. They are shown in the

boxes on the left-hand side and bottom of the figure. The exclusion of
race and current marital status variables from the true disability structural equation, and of the variables capturing personal habits and

model. In the first stage, a set of measurement equations for D5 are
estimated including Y (personal income). In the second stage, we

10

estimate a set of reduced form equations for D* and Y from the measure-

ment equations (stage one). Also in this stage, we obtain the estimates
of the coefficient parameters of the

measurement equations. In the third

stage, we estimate a structural model, in which D* and I are jointly

determined. We begin these estimates with the reduced form estimates
from stage b4o. Throughout, we use ordered polychotomous probit equations and linear regressions as appropriate to the indicator variable.
The structure of this model, using the notation and parameters
corresponding to the notation of all post-parameterized variables and

the Literature would predict. Those living in rural areas tend to

have less indication of the presence of impairing conditions, and this

variable is statistically significant in about one-half of the cases.
Having been exposed to adverse atmospheric conditions prior to the onset
of disability is positively related to impairments and is significant in
several cases; few of the hazardous job characteristics are significant.
With but few exceptions, neither the race nor the marital

variables are significant. Having been a

veteran is

status

generally related to

poorer health status, but is statistically significant in but a few

cases. While the alcohol consumption variable is generally positively
related to the absence of disability statue, it is rarely significant.
The opposite is true of the cigarette consumption variable; it is positively related to disability status and has a statistically significant

coefficient in several of the estimates. Finally, the two economic
variables--income and having a work history-—are inversely related to the
presence or severity of disability, and are generally significant.
The Last column of the table reports the personal income regression.
Education and age enter with the expected signs, and the squared terms of

each are very significant. Rural residence is associated with higher
income, and is also significant. Being exposed to hazardous employment
prior to being disabled is associated with

being

significantly higher income;

married prior to the onset of disability also has higher associated

28

income.

Somewhat surprisingly, the race variables are

not significant.

As has often been found, alcohol consumption is positively and

significantly associated with income; tobacco consumption is a

negative

and significant determinant.

Table

3 presents estimates from the same model,

but for females. The

patterns are similar to those for males, with the primary exception of
the work-nonwork variable. For females, a history of never working tends

to be positively associated with better health and fewer impairments,
perhaps indicating the economic pressure on women with impairments who
simultaneously

tend to be

unmarried. Again, alcohol consumption tends to

be positively related to health; cigarette consumption is associated with
more serious disablements and is significant in about one-half
cases. The results in the income equation are similar

tends to be positively associated with current levels of true dabi1ity
for females, rower levels of D ste associated with being currently

married for both genders. Black men (women) have significantly 1ot
(higher) levels of D, relative to whites and the omitted racial cate-

gories. Hale veterans tend to be more disabled. And, consistent with
the estimates in Tables 2 and 3, alcohol (cigarette) consumption is associated with lower (higher) levels of true disability.

The parameters in the measurement equations for D (see equation 2)
are shown in Table 5, with A

1, a

0 imposed on the Future Work

(Limited Work) equations for males (females). All of the signs are as
expected and the coefficients on each of the eight indicators are very

significant--with t-values ranging from 1.4 to 117. The last indicator,
percentage of jobs for which the respondent is qualified has a very
significant association suggesting the importance of vocational conS idera tions.

The final or third stage involves estimation of the structural parameters, B and r

[equation

(10)) from II, fl. See Table 6. Consider

first the income equation estimates. For both males and females, D is

inversely and significantly associated with personal income-- the

statistics

t-

are very large. Again for both groups, age and education are

significant determinants of income, with reasonable nonlinear patterns of

the relationships. For males and females, education beyond 6 years is
positively associated with income. The age variable for males indicates
a standard hump-shaped profile, peaking at 53 years. For females, the

profile

is positive throughout, suggesting that earnings

increase after

childbearing. This relationship is likely to be related to the large and
significant coefficient on the never worked variable for females.
As

is

expected, for both

sexes,

being currently married is associated

with higher income. Urban-rural location i negatively related to
income, but is never significant. The atmosphere variable reduces personal Income for males, but is not significant. For both bLack and white
males In this sample, personal income is Lower than for the omitted

racial categories; for white females personal income is higher than for
black females and for those in the omitted racial category.

The second column in each panel presents the structural estimates of
the determinants of true disability. For both males and females, income

is

*

negatively related to 1)

,

and is significant in both cases. For males
*

and females, education appears to be negatively associated with D , as
expected. Age is positively and very strongly associated with the true
disability variable for both men and women. For men and women, rural
*

residence

is significantly and negatively associated with 0 .

Hazardous

work contributes to disability status for males and females. Never
having worked is negatively associated with true disability for females,

and the coefficient is statistically significant. The negative coefficient on the atmosphere variable for males is unexpected, but if com-

pensating wage differentials exist, this effect may be picked op in the

Income variable. As expected, veterans status is significantly related

to D for males, and somewhat lees so for females. Marital
onset is positively associated with

status

at

for both females and males.

Finally, as observed previously, alcohol consumption appears to be in-

versely related

to disability status, while cigarette consumption is a

36

significant

contributor to disability status for males.

For

females,

alcohol consumption appears to positively affect disability status; no
affect of cigarette conaumption is observed.
We use these estimates to obtain a predicted disability status

related. Both measures are statistically significant at the 1 percent
level of significance. Recalling that the means are .52 and 2.22 for

While

white males are estimated to be more likely participants in

both equations, the

measured

influence of race is approximately 5 times

greater in the equation including the D* measure of disability.
In the caseof

0* the

influence

of education on labor force par-

ticipation should include both the direct effect and the indirect effect

via its influence on disability (see Table 6). In both equations more
education is associated with greater participation. The total (direct
and indirect) effect of education in the probit with D* (as measured by

the partial derivative at the mean) i 1.78, a value substantially
greater than the very small .0003 partial derivative from the equation
with the self-reported health measure.

A with education, measurement of the effect of age on work requires
consideration of both direct and indirect effects (see Table 6). The
partial derivative of age on male participation in the fl* equation is
-

.186,

as compared to -.0003 in the equation with self-reported health.

Again a sizable difference exists, with a very small influence measured
in the equation with self-reported health and a large and significant
*

influence in the equation with 0

The last variable in the male equations is other family income. The
coefficient has the same sign in both estimatee, but once again the partial derivatives at the mean are quite different in magnitude (-.027 and
—.008); again the larger influence is in the probit with 0*.

The pattern among women is similar. The partial derivative (at the
mean) of the disability measure is substantially greater for

self-reported health. A 5 percent increase in the

is

than

disability measure

associated with a 1.98 percent decrease in women's labor force par-

ticipation for Dt, but only a .7 percent increase using self-reported

41

health. Race (white) is not significant in either equation, but the partial derivative for the total effect of age is -2.74 in the D* equation,
compared to -.003 in the estimate

using

self-reported health. For educa-

tion, the partial derivative for the total effect to 7.82 in the estimate

with

*

D , and .015 with self-reported health. For other family income

this pattern is reversed--the partial derivative is -.009 in the
*
D

equation, and a larger -.039 in the equation with self-reported

health.

These results indicate the importance of the choice of the measure of
health status in understanding the determinants of economic behavior--in

this case, work effort. Not only is the health status measure chosen
crucial to accurately estimating the effect of health on work effort, but

also

to effectively capturing the

influence

of a variety of other

variables on choice.
VI.

CONCLUSION

An indicator of true disability status has been constructed using a
3—stage multiple discrete indicators model. Disability, impairments,
functional limitations, work limitations, and jobs for which qualified

have alL been incorporated into the index. Kence, Dt would appear to
capture the essential characteristics of disability: the inability of an
individual to adequately perform activities required for jobs (or other-

wise perform productively in a social environment) owing to a shortfall

in

*

physical, mental, or emotional capacities. In particular, 0 would

appear to reflect the three moSt important dimensions of disability: the
extent of functional limitations, the severity of these limitations, and

the requirements of functional performance in Jobs for which the indivi*

dual is qualified on other grounds. D can be constructed for any data
set with the exogenous variables included in its construction; it does
not require that the indicators (extensive data on disability, impairments and limitations) be available.

The usefulness of the measure is tested in a simple model of labor

force participation. The results suggest that

the

choice of the health

status indicator included in behavioral equations (such as labor force
participation) has an important influence on the measurement of both the
contribution of health status to behavior and the effects of other deter-

minants on the behavior under investigation. The known

'Extensive discussions of the concepts of disability, impairment, and
health status are found in i1ey and Nagi (1970); Nagi (1979); Berg
(1.973); Eisen, et al. (1979); Haveuian, Ia1berstadt, and Burkhauser

(1984). The importance of the concept used to measure health or disabil-

ity status

in assessing the

extent

of health or disability problems in

the population, and changes in it, was revealed in Calves and Blanchet

(1981). Their analysis of trends in the annual Health Information Survey
(HIS) reveals that health conditions limiting work and other activities
increased substantially in the United States from 1965 to 1975 among all
age and demographic groups, at the same time

that

longevity was

increasing.

that

be

true disability status is itself a choice variable which depends on

the same exogenous variables as, say, retirement (or depends on variables

that are correlated with those determining work effort). If this is the

case,

the effect of disability status, however measured, on work effort

will be overstated, and the true effect of economic variables
camouflaged.
