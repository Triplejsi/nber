A TIMESERIES ANALYSIS OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH:
THE CASE OF BIRTH OUTCOMES IN NEW YORK CITY

ABSTRACT

The paper presents an aggregate

time-series

analysis of unemployment

and infant health that improves on previous work in several ways.

First,

the data is monthly as opposed to annual and pertains to New York City from
January,

1970 to December,

1986.

Second, a structural production function

is estimated in which the race-specific percentage of low-birthweight

births is the health outcome. Because we are able to control for the
race—specific percentage of women who begin care in the first trimester as
well as the percentage of births to unmarried mothers, the unemployment
rate as a proxy for maternal stress enters the production function as one
among a set of well—defined health Inputs.

Third, because a pregnancy is

limited to at most ten months, we can specify a lag length with confidence.
Fourth. the data is tested for stationarity and the production function is

estimated in levels as well as in deviations from trend.

sample of 250 oberservations (Dickcy and Fuller 1981, p. 1063,

whites, the first difference of each of the series (in logs) was
characteristic of an MA(1) process. Thus, we used an autorcgres—
