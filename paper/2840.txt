INTRODUCTION
In this paper I examine the case for auction quotas when there is

either a foreign or domestic monopolist.

A companion paper deals with

oligolistic markets.'
One of the most common criticisms of voluntary export restrictions
(VERS) and of the way quotas are presently allocated is that they allow
foreigners to reap the rents associated with the quantitative constraint.
It has been suggested that auctioning import quotas would be a remedy for
this.

It is claimed that:

this would leave the price support features of quotas intact
but deliver the higher profits to the U.S. economy instead of
abroad.2

In an article in Business Week, Alan Blinder argues that:
Auctioning import rights is one of those marvelous policy
innovations that create winners, but no losers, or, more
precisely, no American losers. The big winner is obvious:
the U.S. Treasury. .

An article

Quota auctions might bring in revenues as high as $7 billion a
year

Takacs (1987) points out that propoaals to auction quotaa have

become increasingly frequent.6 She states:

Commissioners Ablondi and

Leonard of the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) recommended
auctioning sugar quota licenses in 1977.
footwear quotas in 1985.

The ITC recommended auctioning

and Litan (1985) suggested auctioning quotas and earmarking the funds for

importance of the issues involved, the intuition behind

such statements and the procedure used in the estimation is based on models

of perfett competition. In such models, the level of the quota determines

then the world price does change with a quota.

If the

If the country is large,
How it changes is determined

by supply and demand conditions in the world market.
However, when markets are imperfectly competitive, as they are thought

to be in the market for autos, this analysis is misleading.6 In such
environments, prices are chosen by producers, i.e. there is no supply curve,
and the response of producers to the constraint must be taken into account

when determining the price of a license when it is auctioned off.

For

example, if the response of profit maximizing producers is to adjust their
prices so that there is no benefit to be derived from owning a license to
import, its auction price must be zero!
Therefore, the question that needs to be addressed concerns the
behavior of producers in response to quantitative constraints in such
markets, and the impact of this on the price of a license.

Moreover, if no revenues are to be raised from auctioning quotas unless they
are very restrictive, the profit shifting effect of such quotas, even when
auctioned off, is unlikely to outweigh the loss in consumer surplus of such
policies.

For this resson, they are likely to have adverse welfare

consequences even when set optimally.

uncertainty.

The uncertainty case is discussed in Krishna (l988s).

Sections 2 and 3 discuss the price of a license with a foreign
monopoly.

If there is a single foreign supplier of the product, and

markets are segeenred, the price of a license is clearly zero. It is optimal
for the monopolist to raise his price in response to a quota or VER so that
the price of a license becomes zero.

This model with segmented markets is

This is the subject of Section 2.

A simple example is developed in Section 3 in order to show how

The way that this varies with the relative size of the markets and demand

policies.

monopolist in the absence of arbitrage would choose to charge a higher price

monopolist will choose one price which will be between the two prices he
would have set in the absence of arbitrage possibilities.

Thus, the monopolist chooses price ma if he were faced with one market
where the elasticity of demand is a share weighted combination of the
elasticities of the two markets.

The question then is how a quota affects the price charged by the monopolist
when the quota licenses are auctioned off.
At this point it is important to be clear about exactly what
constitutes a license, how licenses are sold, and what the timing of moves
is.

With market segmentation, a license is defined to be a piece of paper

which entitles irs possessor to buy one unit of the product in question at
the price charged

by the seller in his market. If arbitrage

is possible,

then the possessor buys at the lower of the prices charged by the seller in
the home and the world market.

However, it is a dominated strategy for the

monopolist to attempt to charge different prices in his different markets as
sales will only be made at the lower of the two prices.

Thus, slightly restrictive quotas

must reduce welfare because they do not raise revenue and they reduce
consumer surplus.

Quotas at an even lower level conceivably can raise

welfare if the gain in revenue outweighs the loss in consumer surplus.
Finally, auctioning quotas is better than giving them away only when the
license price is positive, i.e.

also that as the world price rises, a quota by one country reduces the
welfare of other importing countries as well as that of the

Prooosttion 1.

With a foreign monopoly and perfect and costless

arbitrage, quotas at or close to the free trade level implemented by
auctioning licenses yield no revenues and must reduce welfare.

Quotas must

be very restrictive if they ste to raise welfare over free trade. Moreover,
auction quotas dominate VERs at the same level only if the restriction is
set at quite a low level.
Three questions naturally arise.

First, how restrictive must the quota

be before a license commands a posi'ive price.

Second, how does the answer

that of the other matket and of demand elasticity in determining the effects

of quota auctions.

HOME MONOPOLY
So far we have argued that with a foreign monopoly there is reason to

The goods are assumed to be differentiated for

The main result is summarized in Proposition 3.

Prooosition 3:

If goods are substitutes and a quota at or close to the

free trade level is imposed then a license has a positive price, while if
goods are complements, the license has a zero price.

In either case,

welfare is adversely effected.
The intuition behind these results is that when goods are substitutes,
a quota at the free trade level implemented by auctioning licenses makes the
demand facing the home monopolist lass elastic for price increases above the
free trade level, but does not alter demand for price decreases.

This

creates an incentive for the home monopolist to raise its price.

This in

turn shifts the demand for the foreign good out and creates a positive price
for licenses.

On the other hand, if goods are complements, the quota makes

elastic

price decreases, but leaves it unaffected for price increases.

This makes

for

it unprofitable to raise or lower prices from the free trade level so that
the market for licenses clears when the license price is zero.
The classic paper by Bhagwati (1965) is related to this section in that

he was the first to point out the price increase induced by a quota with
home monopoly.

However, this analysis differs from his since he does not

address the effects of auctioning quotas.

In addition, both complements and

he considers only subsrirures and a homogeneous product.

If goods are substitutes, an increase in the home goods' price

shifts out demand for the foreign good, thereby raising the price of a
license.

On the other hand, if they are complements, this would shift

demand in and therefore reduce the license price.

Here I argue that this is oot the case.

When the market for licenses clears more slowly than the monopolist sets his

Its profits thus depend on how consumer demand is affected given this level

I call this the case with myopic

consumers realize that the number of

licenses is limited to V, they infer that if the monopolist charges a very
low price so that Q(P+L) > V, i.e., p

<

PV(V)_L, then the shadow price of a

license will exceed L and equal L where Q(P+L) — V, so that,

V(V)_L.

This will give the monopolist a total demand of q(P)+V instead of
q(P)+Q(P+L).

This is the csse with non-myopic consumers.

CONCLUSION
This paper points our that proposals to auction quota licenses are

unlikely to raise revenues in the presence of foreign monopoly power.

In

auctioning quotas is not better than giving them away unless the

quota is quite restrictive.

For this reason,

they are also unlikely to

raise welfare above the free trade level because of the loss of consumer
surplus due to quotas.

However, in the presence of home monopoly power, the

proposal is likely to raise revenues if goods are substitutes.
case, auctioning quotas is preferable to giving them away.

In this

However, if

goods are complements, auction quotas do not raise revenues with a home
monopoly and so do not dominate giving away licenses. Although this paper
only touches on some simple monopoly examples, Krishna (1988) discusses the
case of an oligopoly, where similar results obtain.
Still, much remains to be done to determine the desirability of auction
quotas.

First, their desirability under uncertainty needs more study.

Note

that here a license has an option value and its price is positive even when
the quota is set at the free trade level.
(1988a).

This is discussed in Krishna

Second, it may be possible to use recent work on computable

partial equilibrium models, such as that of Dixit (1987)
Smith (1986),

and Venables and

to help build emperically implementable models to give

estimates of the welfare effects of auctioning quota rights in particular
markets.

Third, while this paper assumes the market for licenses is

competitive, it would be desirable to study the determinants of the market
structure in the market for licenses.

Fourth,

it would be worthwhile asking

whether the results are sensitive to the way that licenses are sold.
