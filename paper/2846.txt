February 1989
COMOVEMENTS IN STOCK PRICES AND
COMOVEMENTS IN DIVIDENDS

ABSTRACT

Simple efficient markets models imply that the covariance between
prices of speculative assets cannot exceed the covariance between their
respective fundamentals unless there is positive information pooling.
Positive information pooling occurs when there is more information, in a
sense defined here, about the aggregate of the fundamentals than there is
about the individual fundamentals.
With constant discount rates, the covariance between prices (detrended
by dividing by a moving average of lagged dividends) in the U. K. and the U.
S. exceeds the covariance of the measure of fundamentals, and there is no

evidence of positive information pooling.

Regression tests of forecast

errors in one country on a real price variable in another country show
significantly negative coefficients. When the present value formula uses
short rates to discount, there is less evidence of excess comovement.

Introduction
Stock price indexes are correlated across countries.

Can such

correlations be justified in terms of correlation across countries in
fundamentals under efficient markets? In real dividends? Or in real
interest rates?
For example, on October 19-20, 1987 the level of stock prices in all
the major stock markets of the world made similar spectacular drops.

Some

observers have stated that it seems unlikely that negative information about
fundamentals appeared in all these diverse economies during the crash.
crash is, however, only one episode.

The

Can stock price comovements overall be

justified by comovements in dividends and real interest rates?2

simple comparisons of such plots do

not enable us to ask whether prices covary more than would be implied by
efficient markets models.

More theoretical apparatus is needed.

•2Pthdyck and Rotemberg have analyzed whether there is excess comovement of commodity prices relative to co-movements in fundamentals.
Their analysis is rather different, in that they did not directly measure
the fundamentals.

This inequalitymeans that the forecast error in the

This implication of the efficient

markets model will be tested in Table 2 below.

articles

Earlier

(LeRoy and Porter, 1981, Shiller, 1981) that claimed to find excess

volatility of stock market indexes have shown (if they are right) evidence
of excess covariance among individual stocks.

But these studies did not

provide evidence whether there was excess covariance between U. K. and U. S.
stock prices, or between major subindexes.

Definitions and Detrending
The prices used for the econometric work were detrended by dividing by
a long moving average of lagged dividends.

This kind of detrending was

discussed in Campbell and Shiller (l988b) where a long moving average of
earnings,

rather than of dividends, was used to detrend.

dividing price by such a moving average is essentially a method of
detrending or of removing low-frequency components.

Since only lagged

(before time t) dividends are used, no future information is used to detrend
the price per share at time t.

Thus, certsin criticisms made in the

literature of the uae of variance inequalities in econometric work are
obviated.

In version II, the discount rate is a short-term interest rate

plus a constant term so that the average discount rate is the same as in

This method of detrending, essentially initiated in Campbell and
Shiller (1988b), represents a substantial improvement over previous
discussions of the alleged excess volatility of stock prices.

If we are to

consider whether stock prices move too much or comove too much, we are in
effect claiming that stocks should be priced differently.

It is important

to have in mind some simple different pricing rule that shows less movement

or less comovement.

In my original paper (1981) the alternative was a

linear trend line for price.

In Mankiw Romer and Shapiro's (1986) it was a

proportional to dividend rule for price.

These alternatives are less

and real dividend series are not at all smooth.

As an alternative to using an arbitrary detrending rule, one may
compute an optimal forecasting rule for future dividends derived from a
cointegrated time series model.

This was done in Campbell and Shiller

(1988a) using a low-order vector autoregressive model.
construction,

However, by

such a model is incapable of forecssting that the present

value of future dividends will depend on a long average of past dividends,
since lags are limited by the length of the autoregression.

When an

ARIMA(l,l,l) model for aggregate U. S. real dividends was estimated (Shiller
1984), it was found that the optimal forecast of the present value of future

dividends did depend on a log exponentially weighted distributed lag on past
dividends, like the one used here to detrend.
The present paper aims to make a point in the simplest way possible,
without reference to complicsted time series models and the linearizations
needed to make these serve our purposes when there are time-varying interest
rates.

The simple detrending rule should be interpreted in this light.

Data
It was felt that a very long span of data was needed to examine the
propositions considered here, data covering many decades.

Obtaining many

observations by sampling frequently will not give us enough data for our
purposes,

see for example Shiller and Perron (1986) or Summers (1987).

There is a growing recognition of the need for a long time span in financial
data, see for example Fama and French (1987) and Schwert (1987).

Finding stock price data with very long time spans is difficult. Most

9

individual stocks do not continue for very long in unchanged form.

Fama and

French examined "survivor" companies that had stayed in business since 1926,
but these companies may be different from others.

To obtain really long

time series of representative stocks we are forced to deal with portfolios
of stocks rather than individual stocks, and these can be represented by
stock price indexes.

in Japan are available back to 1879, but there is a break at World War IT,
after which major holders of stocks, the Zaibatsu, saw their holdings frozen
