INTEGRATION OF MORTGAGE AND CAPITAL MARKETS
AND THE ACCUMULATION OF RESIDENTIAL CAPITAL

ABSTRACT

The securitization of fixed-rate mortgages suggests that the FRA/VA market
was fully integrated with capital markets by the early l98Os and that the
conventional market moved toward integration during the l98Os.

Assuming

full integration of FHA/VA5 via the GNMA securitization process, we first
estimate equations explaining near—par GNMA prices weekly for the 1981-88
period.

The price is then set equal to the new—issue price and, based

upon the preferred equation, the perfect—market retail coupon rate is
computed. Next we estimate equations (for three year segments of the
1971-88 period) explaining conventional commitment mortgage coupon rates
in terms of current and lagged values of this perfect-market coupon rate.
Finally, we examine differences between the perfect—market and actual
coupon rates and compute the impact of these differences on residential
capital accumulation.

Integration of Mortgage and Capital Markets and
the Accumulation of Residential Capital

Patric H. Hendershott and Robert Van Order

The fixed-rate home mortgage market appears to be fully integrated into
"the capital market" broadly defined.

That is, mortgage rates move in response

to changes in other capital market rates, and mortgage funds are readily
available

at going market rates.

Mortgage rates can diverge from other rates

and other securities differ and the "price" of these characteristics

can change, but in a fully integrated capital market shifts in the demands for

or supplies of mortgage funds will not cause divergence to occur.
The mortgage market was integrated gradually throughout the l970s and
first half of the l980s with the development of active markets for mortgage
pass-through securities.

Mortgage market integration has had conflicting effects on homebuyers.
During most of the l960s and 1970s, existence of specialized housing finance
institutions caused mortgage funds to be cheaper than they would have been with
full integration.

In contrast, during the credit crunches of 1969—70 and

1974-75 and during much of the early and middle l980s, when the traditional
housing finance institutions were under enormous pressures

Theory

The neoclassical model applies recent work in financial markets under
perfect competition

(see, e.g., Black and Scholes

(1973), Brennan and Schwartz

(1977), and Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1985)] to mortgages.

The models derive

prices for risky securities in a world free of both transaction costs and
arbitrage profits.

-6—

The underlying methodology as applied to mortgage and other markets (see
Brennan and Schwartz (1985) and Hendershott and Van Order

(1988) for

expositions applied to mortgage markets] comes from Black and Scholes' insight
that in perfect capital markets with enough independent assets a portfolio of
several assets can be set up that, at least over a short time period, exactly
replicates the returns of the asset to be priced.

From this portfolio, the

price of the aseet in question can, with some mathematical dexterity, be
determined.

In mortgage markets the bulk of research has been on pricinq long-term

or Ginnie Maes.2

An investor in a typical fixed—rate mortgage is long an amortizing 30—
year bond but short en American call on the bond.

Absent default risk and

transaction costs, the risk in holding the mortgage comes only from interest
rates and is composed of two parts:

the usual interest rate riak on the bond

and the interest rate risk on the option.

The combination of the two leads to

an asymmetry that is the central issue in mortgage pricing:

when interest

rates rise, the mortgage investor loses because mortgage price falls, but when
rates fall, the investor's gains are limited because borrowers will exercise
their option to prepay at par.

This

-

option is most transparent in the case of the FHA/VA mortgages in

Ginnie Mae poo1s because those mortgages can be assumed by new house buyers.

Thus the financing and selling of the house are, in perfect markets, separate.

—7—

But there are transaction costs, -and while people do seem to act qualitatively

as the model says, they do not prepay as ruthlessly as some early applications
of the models suggested.

This is apparent from both prepayment data, which

show only gradual changes in prepayment rates in the face of large interest
rate declines, and empirical

The bond has the usual downward sloping convex shape.

Line 8CM shows the value

curves is the value of the call option.

The mortgage can never have a value

greater than par, and in fact the curve must become tangent to the par line.
This tangency is a first order condition for optimal exercise of the call (see
Hendershott—Van Order (1988) for a brief discussion)

Segmented Markets
The perfect market model says that mortgage price

(or alternatively the

mortgage coupon rate for a given mortgage price) depends on a small number of
general capital market variables,

that the response to changes in those

variables is predictable and fast, and that mortgage price (or coupon rate)
does not depend on variables peculiar to the mortgage market, like details of

Between 1962 and 1969, the transfer was limited to 60 percent

40 percent; the Tax Reform Act of 1986 lowered the fraction to 8 percent.

A separate issue is whether mortgage rates in the l970s were higher or
lower than they would have been in the perfect market case.

One might suspect

that they were generally lower owing to the large tax advantages until recently
enjoyed by thrifts, the portfolio restrictions that kept thrifts out of many
other lending activities, and the possibility that thrifts did not fully
