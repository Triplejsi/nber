PRECAUTIONARY SAVING IN THE SMALL AND IN THE LARGE

ABSTRACT

The theory of precautionary saving is shown in this paper to be
isomorphic to the Arrow-Pratt theory of risk aversion, making possible
the application of a large body of knowledge about risk aversion to

precautionary saving, and more generally, to the theory of optimal choice
under risk.

In particular,

a measure of the strength of precautionary

saving motive analogous to the Arrow-Pratt measure of risk aversion is

used to establish a number of new propositions about precautionary
saving, and to give a new interpretation

of the Oreze-Modigliani sub-

stitution effect.

I. Introduction
It has been recognized since Bernoulli (1738) that risk aversion can be associated with concavity of utility functions. But it was not until Pratt (1964) and Arrow (1965) that it was recognized
that the function z4iLl_or the related index
was an excellent measure of risk aversion.
the
Arrow-Pratt
measures
of
absolute
and
relative risk aversion have often demonSubsequently,
strated their usefulness in a wide range of both theoretical and empirical studies of behavior under
uncertainty.5 In addition, the example of the Arrow-Pratt measures of risk aversion has spurred
a considerable amount of research on other ways to characterize aspects of risk aversion, such as
Ross' (1981) work on a notion of "strongly more risk averse" or Pratt and Zeckhauser's (1987) work
on "proper risk aversion."

In the study of precautionary saving, it has been known since Leland (1968) and Sandmo
(1970) that precautionary saving in response to risk is associated with convexity of the marginal
utility function, or a positive third derivative of a von Neumann-Morgensternutility function. More
generally, Rothschild and Stiglitz (1971) note that if an individual's utility is a function of a control
variable 8 and an exogenous random variable 9, so that he or she solves

is

However, unlike the theory of risk aversion, which lays out in considerable detail the determinants

of the magnitude of the effects of risk on ezpected utility, the theory of the optimal response of
decision variables to risk (which includes precautionary saving as a subcase) has not hitherto said
much about the magnitude of these responses. Fortunately, as will be shown, this is an easily
remedied deficiency, since a straightforward reinterpretation of the mathematical theory yields an
equally powerful theory of the optimal response of decision variables to risk—and in particular,a
theory of precautionary saving closely analogous to the Arrow-Pratt theory of risk aversion.
Mathematically,the Acrow-Pratt index —v"(x)/v'(z) = a(x) is a good measure of risk aversion
because given two utility functions vs(x) and v2(z), ifai(x) > a2(x) for all z, then vs(z) = g(v2(z))
where g() is a monotonically increasing, concave function.2 If v5

If we give the name "prudence" to the sensitivity of the optimal choice of a decision variable
to risk, then
6) is a measure of "absolute prudence," and 9 i(9, 6) is a measure of "relative
prudence," just as a(x) is a measure of absolute risk aversion and x a(x) is a measure of relative
risk aversion. The term "prudeuce" is meant to suggest the propensity to prepare and forearm
oneself in the lace of uncertainty, in contrast to "risk aversion," which is how much one dislikes
uncertainty and would turn away from uncertainty if one could.3
Though the analogy between the theory of risk aversion and the theory of the optimal response

of decision variables to risk is quite general, concreteness is especially importantin illustrating a
technique of reinterpretation. The determination of precautionary saving is an example of the effect
of risk on a decision variable that is not only simple, but also one that has considerable importance
in its own right. Therefore, after a few remarks on a general plane in Section II, establishing the
usefulness of "prudence" as a measure of the sensitivity of choices to risk, we will turn to a deeper
investigation of precautionary saving.4 Section III establishes the formal similarity between the
theory of precautionary saving in particular and the theory of risk aversion. Section IV applies the
most basic results about risk aversion to precautionary saving. Section V explores the consequences
of decreasing, increasing or constant absolute prudence in the context of precautionary saving,
including the effects of uncertainty on the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth. Section
VI briefly considers the consequences of facing more than one risk at a time. Section VII uses the
concept of "prudence" to provide a novel interpretation of the Drkze-Modigliani (1972) substitution
effect as the consequence of the precautionary saving motive being stronger than risk aversion in
In differentcontexts, "prudence" will have different meanings. In the paradigmaticexample of the consemptionsaving decision under uncertainty, "prudence"represents the intensity of the precautionarysaving mntive.
Kimball (1955a) offers another, quite different, example of how the mathematical theory of risk aversion can
be used to study optimal decisions under risk.

H. Prudence as a Measureof the Sensitivity of a Decision Variableto Risk
Four of the basic results in the theory of risk aversion involving risk premia can be applied
readily to any model of choice under uncertainty that falls under Rothschild and Stiglitz' (1971)
general description. In order to state these results we must first define two concepts analogous to
risk premia.
Let a probability distribution for 9 be analyzed into 9 = 9o + where 9 is a certain quantity
and 6 is a random variable. Then we will call an "equivalent precautionary premium" for 6 if it
satisfies

for two different distributions of 9: for 9 equal to 9o — with certainty, and for 9 equal to the
random variable ee + 6. If these first order conditions are also sufficient for an optimum, then the
equivalent precautionary premium is the certain reduction in 8 from the initial value 8e that has

premia, which are analogous to equivalent and rompensating variations under certainty. Pratt (1964) refers
to this distinction in passing, noting that the "asking price" price of a risk (the equivalent risk premium) is
different from the "bid price" of a risk (the compensatingrisk premium). He refers to the compensating risk
premium as the "bid price" of a risk.
Compensation for an effect on a decision variable should not be confused with welfare compensation. The two
often do not coincide, as can be seen, for example, in Section VII on the Dréze-Modigliani substitution effect.

a' where both exist. Both statements are also true

if the equivalent and compensating premia are

interchanged.
A proof is in Appendix A. As a consequence of this lemma, not only only are
equivalent and

compensating risk premia approximately equal "in the small," but almost all significant qualitative
results about equivalent risk premia are interchangeable with
corresponding results about compensating risk premia, including the result the result about risk premia "in the large" discussed above.
Furthermore, because of the close analogy between risk premia and precautionary premia, we can
be confident that a result about equivalent precautionary premia will imply a
corresponding result
about compensating precautionary premia.15

III. The Analogy Between Precautionary Saving and Risk Aversion
From this point on, our discussion will be much more concrete, as we focus on the

consumptionsavings decision under uncertalnty as a paradigmatic example of choice under risk. Establishing
the formal correspondence between precautionary saving and risk aversion
requires us to set out
a simple model representing this consumption-savings decision. The simplest such model is one
that has only two periods, in which a consumer imbued with additively time-separable utility faces
uncertaln labor income in the second period. This is the model taken up here. The extension to
more than two periods is difficult, but important,and is pursued in Kimball
(1988b). The extension
to the case of nonseparable utility is relatively stralghtforward, but cumbersome, and is addressed
in Appendix C.

than the minimum value of his or her human wealth
is never binding except at the end of the last period of the agent's existence. Since the interest
rate is exogenously given, it is easiest to calculate everything in present-value terms, so that we
can, without loss of generality, treat the real risk-free rate as if it were zero. Finally, it will be
assumed that labor supply is inelastic, so that labor income can be treated as if it were manna
from heaven.12 With the foregoing simplifications,the consumer's decision problem is:
an agent cannot borrow against more

u(c)+Ev(wo—c+y),

where u is the first period utility function, c the first period consumption, E an expectation
conditional on first-period information, v the second-period utility function, w5 the consumer's
initial assets plus his first-period labor income (whichis received before the first-period consumption
decision must be made) and p the second-period labor income.

It

dividing second-periodlabor income p into its
expectation and a mean zero risky component and to define so = so0 + adding mean secondperiod income to initial assets to get the total of human and non-human wealth (which is what

,

determines consumption in the case of certainty equivalence). We will also define for later use
= so — c, the amount of "saving" out of total human and non-human wealth. The consumer's
decision problem can then be rewritten:

maxu(c)+Ev(w-c+y).
The first-order condition for (7) is

u'(c) = E v'(sv — c +

).

It is clear from this first-order condition that the risk in second-period income will affect consumption in the first period only insofar as it affects second-period expected marginal utility. The
fact that expected marginal utility is unaffected by the addition of mean-zero risks in the case of
quadratic utility is what yields certainty equivalencein that case. Even when certainty equivalence
does not hold, if there is some quantity 1' that can compensate for the effect of the risk on
second-period expected marginal utility—that is, a compensating precautionary premium satisfying v'(w — c) = Ev'(w — c + + ), then first-period consumption would be unaltered by the

Interpreting the two precautionary premia in a slightly different way, the compensating precautionary premium & shows how far the first-period consumption function will shift to the right
at a given level of consumption, since it shows how much more wealth is needed to compensate for
the effect of the risk on consumption. Similarly, the equivalent precautionary premium shows
the leftward shift of the consumption function that would result from elimination of the risk

.

Appendix B contains a demonstration

of these two propositions.

To place this model within the Rothschild-Stiglitzframework used in Section II, we could write
V(w + ü, c)

= u(c) + v(w — c + u)

Consumption is the decision variable, so that c takes on the role of 8, while w has the role of 9e,
= u'(c) — v'(u,— c+ and in
the role of U and to + the role of 9 itself.'3 In place of we have

we have —v"(w — c +

premium for all other combinations of consumption and wealth involving the same level of "saving"

us to give an economic interpretationto the precautionary premia for any value of a.
The analogy between the theory of risk aversion and the theory of precautionary saving is

particularly simple. The negative of marginal utility —v' plays substantially the same role for precautionary saving that the utility function itself plays for risk aversion. For example, concavity of v
indicates risk aversion, while concavityof —v' or v"(.) > 0 indicates a positive precautionary saving
motive. As another example, the index of absolute prudence in this model, where it represents the
strength of the precautionary saving motive, is

Thus, the analogy between absolute risk aversion and absolute prudence is especially obvious in this
context. In general, virtually every theorem about risk aversion has an application to precautionary
saving by substituting —si' for v and making other appropriate adjustments. We will proceed in
exactly this way: reinterpreting many of the most important theorems about risk aversion as
theorems about precautionary saving.14

IV. Prudence as a Measureof the Intensity of the Precautionary Saving Motive
Applying the results of Section II to precautionary saving, we find first that the increase in
the wealth needed to induce any given level of first-period consumption—or in other words, the
rightward shift of the consumption function—due to a small risk is approximately q(s) =

of human and nonhuman wealth s is also the mean of second-period
consumption) times half the variance of the risk. Similarly, the leftward shift of the consumption
function due to the elimination of a small risk is approximately q(s) times half the variance of the

in second-period labor income causes a greater rightward shift of the
consumption function for an individual with second-period utility v1 than one with second-period
human wealth s, the risk
utility v2.

If the first-period utility functions are such that the consumption functions in the absence

of the income risk are identical (for example, if szj(c) = lvs(Ac) and u2(c) = *v2(Ac) so that the
consumption functions are both linear, with slope j--) then points with the same saving and the
same initial second-periodconsumption also have the same first-period consumption; therefore agent

function. Similarly, the leftward shift of the consumption function due to eliminating the risk
is greater for agent 1 than for agent 2 at points with the same amount of saving a. If by chance

"saving" and mean second-period consumption s have the same consumption c ss well, so that the
whole graph of the consumption function shifts further left for agent 1 than for agent 2 when the
income risk is eliminated.

In addition to applying the results of Section II to precautionary saving, the simple structure
of precautionary saving under additively separable utility makes it possible to bring to bear the
result of Arrow (1965) that a globally more risk-averse individual will choose to invest less in a
risky security. Formally, Arrow states that if v is globally more risk averse than v2 (that is,
ai(x) > as(x) for all x) then aj(i,x) .c a2(2,x) for all z, where
(12)

oi(i,x) =

argmaxEv1(x + af),

and

As Arrow (1965)also makes clear, differentiatingtwice with respect to a shows

that expected utility

To make the application of the foregoing result to precautionary saving, substitute —v for c1
—t4 for v2 to find that if ?)1(s) > m(8) for all x, then $i(, 3) c fl2(D, s), where

How can this be interpreted? Since

= E [—v'(s + /11)]

for an individual allowed to freely choose his or her level of consumption and saving, the level
of consumption corresponding to a given level of saving must be greatest for the value of $ that
maximizes the right-hand side. To look at things another way, since total human and non-human

the sense that looking at the equivalent precautionary premium

increasing, or constant absolute prudence can only tell us that if income risk is eliminated, the
effect on the marginal propensity to consume is the opposite of what happens when income risk is
introduced. More illuminating is the interpretation of the fact that 13(2, s) is increasing, decreasing
or constant as absolute prudence is respectively decreasing, increasing or constant. It indicates,
for example, that in the case of decreasing absolute prudence, the amount of the risk 2 the agent
can absorb before the reduction in saving due to the positive mean of 2 begins to be dominated by
precautionary saving effects (or more precisely, the value of 13 beyond which increases in 13 reduce
the wealth corresponding to a given amount of saving) is increasing in s. In the case of increasing
absolute prudence, this watershed amount of risk is decreasing in s; and in the case of constant
absolute prudence, it is constant.

VI. The Effect of Income Risk in the Presence of Other Independent Risks
One possible objection to the original Arrow-Pratt theory of risk aversion is that it tends to
compare risky situations with situations of certainty. Actual economic agents are more likely to

be comparing two situations of uncertainty. Fortunately, Kihlstrom, Romer and Williams (1981),
and Nacbman (1982) show that the Arrow-Pratt theory of risk aversion applies not only to risks
imposed on a world of certainty, but also to risks added to the preexisting uncertainty, as long as (a)

This they term the "substitution effect." They show that this "substitution effect" is positive if
preferences for second-period consumption display decreasing absolute risk aversion, negative in
the case of increasing absolute risk aversion and zero in the case of constant absolute risk aversion.
In the model presented here, the correspondence between the direction of the substitution
effect and decreasing versus increasing absolute risk aversion is a
simple consequence of the fact
that obsolute prudence is greater than or less than absolute risk aversion depending on whether
absolute risk aversion is decreasing or increasing. To see this, one need only take the
logarithmic
derivative of absolute risk aversion:

Focusing on the most important case, decreasing absolute risk aversion implies that prudence
exceeds risk aversion.24 To put it another way, decreasing absolute risk aversion
implies that
—v'(x) is more risk averse than v(z).

If —i,'(x) is more risk averse than v(x), then precautionary saving effects are at least as

(25)

Thus, decreasing absolute risk aversion impli that whether startingfrom certainty or consideringadditional risks independent of background uncertainty, each precautionary premium is greater
than the correspondingrisk premium, and the amount of a risky security an agent would freely
choose is larger than the amount which, if forced on him or her, would require the most wealth to
induce a given amount of saving.
We can give a more vivid interpretation of the above facts about precautionary and risk premia.
means that the extra wealth it would take to bring the agent'sconsumption in the presence

of back to what it was in the absence of is greater than the amount it would take to bribe the

s

individual to accept the risk Q. Therefore, if a monopolist selling the risk plus a certain positive
quantity effectively price-discriminates so that the consumer gets no surplus from buying it (but

the purchase is still voluntary), the consumer's first-period consumption will decline. (However,
if the consumer gets some surplus—that is, a bigger bribe to take than necessary—first-period
consumption may go up.) Conversely, > ir means that the maximum amount a consumer is
wilting to pay for complete insurance, or insurance from a risk independent of other risks, is less
than the amount that would have to be taken from the agent in order to keep his or her consumption
the same despite the reduction in risk. Therefore, any voluntary purchase of complete insurance, or
insurance from a risk independent of other risks, will increase the agent's first-period consumption;
since even if the agent was indifferent about getting the insurance, consumption would increase,
and whatever consumer's surplus the agent gets (i.e., however much less the agent pays than he or

Finally, the fact that /3(i, s) < a(2, a) can be interpreted graphically as in Figures 1 and 2.
Figure 1 shows a graph of expected utility and expected marginal utility as a function of the amount
A of a risky security held. Expected marginal utility is minimized, and therefore the first-period
consumption and wealth corresponding to a given level of saving is maximized, for a smaller value
of A than the one that maximizes utility. Since both E [0(8 + Af)] and E [—v'(s + Ai)] are concave
functions25 of A, this means that at the amount of the risky security the agent will choose and for
a range of lower amounts and aU higher amounts of the risky security, more of that security will

security will lead to increased precautionary saving and less first-period consumption at the same
level of wealth.
Figure 2 shows these facts in a different way. Decreasing absolute risk aversion implies both
that the curve A = o(i, s) will be upward sloping in the A-s plane and that the curve A = /3(2's)
of A = cs(2, s). (The curve A

= /3(2, a) is upward sloping in the case of decreasing
absolute prudence, but otherwise may not be.) There is a region at the left, where the amount of
the risky security is low enough relative to saving that more of the security increases both expected

utility and first-period consumption. At the right, the amount of the risky security is so largethat if
forced to hold even more, both the agent's expected utility and his or her first-period consumption
would decrease. In the middle is a region where more of the risky security increases expected utility
but reduces first-period consumption. On the boundary where increases in the risky security have
no effect on first-period consumption (where A = /3(2,s)), they always increase expected utility.
Finally, at the amount of the risky security that maximizesexpected utility (A = cs(i, s)), more of
the risky security olways increases precautionary saving and decreases first-period consumption.

of the

facts above, it can

be seen that the opportunity to make risky investments
has two possibly divergent effects on the marginal propensity to consume. On the one hand, free
choice about riaky investments may lead agents to voluntarily face more risk than they otherwise
would—risk which tends to increase the marginal propensity to consume in the case of decreasing
absolute prudence (or decrease it in the case of increasing absolute prudence). On the other hand,
assuming we have decreasing absolute risk aversion, the endogenous increase in risky investment
that comes with an increase in wealth will tend to reduce consumption because of the DrèzeModigliani substitution effect, implying a lower overall marginal propensity to consume.26 These
effects are discussed in more detail in Kimball (1988b).
In view

VIII. Conclusion
Since Leland (1968), it has been recognized that a positive third derivative of the utility
function indicates a precautionary saving motive—that is, that uncertainty about future income
will reduce current consumption and increase current saving. Thus, the sign

of the third derivative

of the utility function governs the presence or absence of a precautionary saving motive just as
the sign of the second derivative governs the presence or absence of risk aversion. We have shown
26 In

the case of increasing absolute risk aversion, the endogenous decressein risky investment that comes with
an inrrease in wealth will tend to reduce consumption, also tending to lower the overall marginal propensity
to cnnsume. In the case of constant absolute risk aversion there is no endogenous change in risky investment
due to a change in wealth and so the marginal propensity to consume is unaffected by the possibility of risky

investment.

16

that the analogy between risk aversion and the precaotionary saving motive extends much deeper.
Without taking undue license, it can be saidthat the precautionary saving motive is risk aversion

of the negative of marginal utility.
More generally,the theory of risk aversion can be used to study any situation of optimal choice
under uncertainty. In particular, the Arrow-Pratt measures of absolute and relative risk aversion
have the counterparts in the theory of choice under uncertainty of absolute and relative prudence,
which measure the sensitivity to risk of the optimal choice of a decision variable.
Some of the specific results established about the paradigmatic case of precautionary saving

"

are:

just as absolute risk aversion
(2) Ignoring the effects of endogenous choice of the level of risky investment, if absolute prudence,
9i", is decreasing, then labor income uncertainty will raise the marginal propensity to consume
at any given level of consumption. Conversely,if absolute prudence is increasing, labor income
uncertainty will lower the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth at a given initial level
of consumption.
(3) The Dreze-Modigliani(1972) "substitution effect" can be interpretedvery readily in terms of
the fact the index of absolute prudence exceeds the Arrow-Pratt index of absolute risk aversion
whenever absolute risk aversion is decreasing, and is less than

the Arrow-Pratt measure of risk

aversion when absolute risk aversion is increasing.

(4) Holding constant the initial amount of risk an agent faces, endogenous adjustment of the
amount of risky security holding will result in a lower marginal propensity to consume.
(5) If the utility of future consumption v is infinitely differentiable with its derivatives alternating
in sign then the precautionary saving effects of independent income risks (as measured by
precautionary premia) are more than additive.
(6) The main results can easily be extended to the case of independent background risk and to
the case of non-additively-separable von Neumann-Morgenstern utility.27
Since uncertainty is present in almost all aspects of life, the theory of choice under uncertainty
is likely to become an even more important part of economicsin the future than it is now. Although
it will not answer every question about choice under uncertainty, we can hope that the close analogy
27 That extension is in

between:risk aversion and the sensitivity of optimal choices to risk will continue to be fruitful in
illuminating many other responses to risk as it illuminates precautionary saving.

Appendix A

The Connection Between Equivalent and Compensating Risk Premia
To see that the functions 1(z) = x — ir(2,z) and g(z) = x + ir(2,z) are mutual inverses one
must examine closely the the definitions of ir(2, z) and ir(2, z). If
z = x — ir(2, z),

The monotonicity aud continuity of v insures that both f(x) and g(z) are also continuous and

7rs(z,z) > ir2(2,z) for all x so that the curve for v5 is below the curve for v2, then the curve for v5
to the right of the curve for v2, so that rr(2,x) > 1r(2,z*) for all z, and vice versa. Similarly,
if ir(21, z) > ir(22,x) for z one can show graphically that ir(25, x) > ir(22, x) for all z and vice

or in words, that prudence is greater than risk aversion. Similarly, if we have "endogenously increasing risk aversion," prudence will be smaller than risk aversion. The consequences of these facts
for the relative sizes of risk and precautionary premia are virtually identical to the consequences
of decreasing or increasing absolute risk aversion in the additively separable case, as can be seen
from Drèze and Modigliani's results. Furthermore, just as in the additively-separable case, at the
amount of a risky security that maximizes expected utility, an increase in the amount held will
tend to reduce first-period consumption if absolute risk aversion is (endogenously) decreasing and
will tend to increase first-period consumption if absolute risk aversion is (endogenously) increasing,
making endogenous adjustment of investment in a risky security reduce the marginal propensity to
consume in the nonseparable case as well.
