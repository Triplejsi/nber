NBER Working Paper #2849
February 1989
A MODEST PROPOSAL FOR INTERNATIONAL NOMINAL TARGETING (INT)
ABSTRACT

The paper reviews the obstacles to successful international
macroeconomic policy coordination, and then offers a proposal for
coordination that is designed to have the best chance of
overcoming these obstacles: an international version of nominal
GNP targeting. There are three sorts of obstacles to
coordination: uncertainty, enforcement, and inflation-fighting
credibility. Enforcement is always a problem for coordination,
but the problem is particularly great in the presence of
uncertainty. This is partly because it is difficult to verify
compliance if the "performance criteria" are not directly enough
under the control of the authorities, and partly because a
country may end up regretting cx Post the criterion that it
agreed to cx ante if the criterion is not directly enough related
to the target variables about which it ultimately cares.
For
example, a country that commits to a narrow range for the money
supply may regret the commitment if a shift in velocity occurs.
The time-inconsistency of inflation-fighting has been
offered as a third reason why policy-makers would be better off
renouncing period-by-period coordination of discretionary policymaking. But the way to establish inflation-fighting credibility
is to precommit to some nominal anchor.
The paper argues that
International Nominal Targeting (INT) is the best choice for
nominal anchor, as well as the best choice for the
performance
criterion by which compliance with international agreements can
be monitored. Nominal GNP (or, better yet, nominal demand) is
superior to other candidates such as Ml as a candidate for the
nominal variable on which policy-makers should focus, because it
is far more robust to velocity shifts and other uncertainties,

Whiie Milton Frian has justifiably had ncre influerce on this
issue than one hinian being is usually able to have, there have
been two
aspects of his campaign against the Faderal Reserve Board that are p.xzzlirx.
First, his arg.mnt against discretion in xxcnetaxy policy-making is largely
basad on the analysis in Friadman az Schwartz that the FeSeral Reserve made

have been by
"aflcMir' the Ml ncney supply to fall. Yet in recent decades he has
canpaigned for the Fad to do precisely what he aises then of dOing in the
1930s: set a firm target for the ilxrietaxy base rather than for Ml. The
secord, even ucre pozzling, aspect is that Frinan ard his fell,
ncnetarists claim to believe that U.S. xxey grth wfld be slower ard

the other — even though happy to go alorg with the bargain — will in fact
