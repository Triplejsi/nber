MONEY, INCOME AND PRICES AFtER THE 1980s

ABSTRACT

Three empirical findings presented in this paper show that evidence based
on the most recent U.S. experience does not indicate the kind of close or
reliable relationship between money and nonfinancial economic activity that, if
present, might warrant basing the design and implementation of monetary policy
on money in a formally systematic way: First, extending the familiar
time-series analysis to include data from the 1980s sharply weakens the
evidence from prior periods showing that such relationships existed between
money and nominal income, or between money and either real income or prices
considered separately.
Focusing on data from 1970 onward destroys this
evidence altogether.
Second, the finding by Stock and Watson that particular forms of
time-series experiments still showed a significant role for money in affecting
real output through 1985 not only becomes weaker on the inclusion of da-ta from
1986 and 1987 but also, even for data through 1985 only, turns out to depend on
the use in their analysis of a particular short-term interest rate, the
Treasury bill rate. Using instead the commercial paper rate, which apparently
is superior in capturing the information in financial prices that matters for
real output, also greatly weakens their result. Simultaneouslyusing the
commercial paper rate and including data through 1987 destroys it altogether.
Third, extending the analysis through 1987 also destroys the time-series
evidence from earlier periods showing that money and income are co-integrated.
Even if monetary policy were to be conducted in terms of targets for money
growth, the failure of money and income to be co-integrated means that there is
no empirical ground for resisting the "base drift" that results from persistent
random differences between actual money growth and the corresponding target.

MONEY. INCOME AND PRICES AflER THE 1980S

Benjamin M. Friedman and Kenneth N. Kuttner*

Economists have long understood that the quantity of money, or its growth
rate, can play a useful role in the monetary policy process only to the extent

that fluctuations

in income, or prices, or whatever other aspects of economic

activity the central bank seeks to influence.

The same is true, of course,

for

non-money assets, for example, or measures of

for that matter, interest rates and any other financial prices.

Especially in the case of money, a rich literature developed over many years has
investigated in some detail the requirements that the relationships connecting
money to income and/or prices must satisfy in order to warrant focusing monetary

policy on money in any of several specific waysJ

An equally rich empirical

literature has repeatedly sought to establish whether these requirements have

actually been satisfied at specific times and in specific places.2
Different ways of conceptuallybasing the monetary policy process- on money
place different empirical

requirements on the relationships between money and

the economic variables that are of ultimate policy concern.

These relationships

in turn depend on such basic dimensions of economic behavior as the nature of
the economy's

aggregate

supply process, the degree of price flexibility, the

interest and wealth elasticities

of aggregate demand, and, importantly

public's money demand behavior and the banks' money supply behavior.

The empirical

findings presented

in this paper consistently show that

evidence based on the most recent U.S. experience

does not indicate a close or

reliable relationship between money and nonfinancial economic activity.

Third, extending the analysis through 1987 also destroys the time-series
evidence from earlier periods showing that money and income are co-integrated.
As in the first set of conclusions,

this deterioration in the 1980s applies not

just to Ml but also to other monetary aggregates and to credit.

Further, even if the central

bank did choose for some reason to base monetary policy on the use of money as
an intermediate target, in the absence of evidence indicating that money and
income are co-integrated there would be no grounds on which to resist "base
drift."
The paper's one finding with potentially positive implications

for monetary

policy is that the spread between the commerical paper rate and the Treasury
bill rate does contain information about future movements in real income,
information that is highly significant regardless of the sample period under
investigation.

It

to imagine that the Federal Reserve could use

this interest rate spread as an intermediate policy target, and doubtful that

See, for example, Nelson and Plosser (1982). In more precise statistical

10.

The origin of the label "base drift" for this problem was the complaint,
often voiced during the late 1970s, that the Federal Reserve System was
accommodating rising inflation by pursuing a "bygones" strategy in which
the targeted rate of money growth was low each year but actual money growth
on a multi-year basis was high because, with repeated upward errors, each
year's target growth was calibrated from the higher "base" level resulting
from the previous year's actual growth.

As is well known, the distribution of the resulting test statistic is
highly non-normal, and so critical values are typically calculated from

co-integration, and for computation of critical values.
