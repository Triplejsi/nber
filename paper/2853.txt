This paper investigates the recent rise in second mortgage

borrowing and examines its impact on private saving.

The first

section places the recent increase in second mortgage activity
in context, documenting broad trends in residential borrowing

during the last three decades and providing specific evidence on
the recent growth in home equity credit lines.

Section two

examines the magnitude of potential home equity borrowing,
recognizing that second mortgages have not diffused completely
through the population.

We explicitly account for recent

limitations on the amount of tax-deductible second mortgage
interest and show that even assuming households refrain from
non-deductible borrowing, over two trillion dollars of home
equity remains to be borrowed against.
The next two sections present evidence on the link
between second-mortgage borrowing and wealth accumulation.
Section three explains why aggregate evidence on the coincidence
between declines in private saving and increased home equity
borrowing is weak, and describes the data set drawn from the

Trends in Residential Financing. 1950-1988
The rise in second aortgage borrowing during the l980a has

helped propel

the debt-to-value ratio on owner-occupied housing

to its highest level

since World War II.

Table 1 shows the time

series for this ratio, which rises from the early l950a through
the mid-l970a.

In part because owner-occupied house prices rose

by 35 percent in real terms during the 1970s1,

ratio declined from 42% in 1970 to 36% in 1980.

The present paper attempts to provide

some insight on whether such a link between saving and second

The characteristics of actual and potential second mortgagors raise doubts about the role of second mortgages in reducing
saving.

Table

presents evidence on the fraction of homeowners

in different age groups who have second mortgages, based on

tabulations from SIPP.

The table distinguishes between second

mortgages that were obtained when the house was purchased, and
those obtained after home purchase.

The incidence of second

mortgages peaks for households with heads between 35 and 44
years of age: more than 15% of households in this group report
second mortgages.

The rate is only slightly lower

account for more than two-thirds of the outstanding second

the very young (<25) and the elderly (>64),

debts

raise questions about how these mortgages affect saving.

Results from the 1980 Census of Housing on why second mortgagors
obtained these debts are informative.

Of those who responded,

51% of respondents cited the need to make home improvements as

motivating their borrowing decision, 18% cited other investments
either in real estate or other assets, 4.6% cited education or
medical expenses,

and 26% cited other reasons.

of the households with second mortgages reported investment,

rather than consumption, factors as motivating their decision to
borrow.

The national accounts define some expenditures on

renovations, as well as medical and educational expenses, as
consumption.

Part of these expenditures should be viewed as

investments in human capital or consumer durables, and could
therefore arguably be excluded from consumption.3

A

1987 survey by the Survey Research Center directed at

second mortgagors with home equity lines (HELs) yielded similar
findings.

For these households,

53% reported that the first use

of their HEL was to pay off other debt.

One quarter indicated

they obtained their home equity loan principally to finance

a

home improvement, although another 19% of the respondents indi-

cated some subsequent use of the home equity loan to finance
renovations.

In addition, 12% of the respondents indicated the

loan was used to finance a new car purchase, while only 8% used

The impact of second mortgage

borrowing on household consumption is therefore an empirical
question.

How Much Home Equity Is Still Locked Up?

2.

The previous section noted the rapid rise in second

mortgage borrowing during the 1980s, but provided no evidence on
the magnitude of potential future borrowing.

Since the Tax

Reform Act of 1986 (TRA) raised the attractiveness of home
equity borrowing in comparison to other types of consumer debt,
an increasing fraction of households are likely to incur second

mortgages.

While

it is straightforward to calculate the

household sector's net equity in owner-occupied real estate,
recent tax changes restrict the amount of mortgage interest that
households may deduct from their taxable income.

Estimating the

amount of home equity that could be borrowed against at favorable after-tax interest rates therefore requires information on
the fraction of households that would be affected by the legal

caps on interest deductibility, and the amount of housing equity
they hold.

In this section we describe the limits

on tax-

deductible borrowing, and then use the SIFF data base to
estimate the amount of home equity that remains to be levered in
a

tax-deductible form.

2.1

Limitations on Tax-Deductible Home Morteage Interest
The TRA phased out deductions for all consumer interest

8

except that on debt secured by first or second homes.

Interest

on original purchase home loans of less than $1 million remains

fully deductible under the TRA, and this upper limit binds for
relatively few households.

Mortgages obtained after purchase

are subject to tighter restrictions.

"tracing rules"

While the TRA instituted

that made interest deductibility contingent on

the purpose for which debt was incurred, these complex rules
were superceded by provisions in the 198] Omnibus Budget

Reconciliation Act.

A taxpayer can deduct unlimited interest on

post-acquisition borrowing provided the debt is used to finance
additions or alterations to the residence.

A homeowner can never deduct interest on non-renovation

most households will probably avoid borrowing more than the

Our next

section calculates the amount of accumulated home equity that
could be levered at tax-favored rates.

2.2

Estimates of Available Home Equity
To estimate the amount of equity that might be borrowed

against for purposes other than home renovations, we make three
assumptions:

(1)

households cannot borrow more than 90% of the

value of their home,
than,

(ii) households borrow up to, but not more

the amount of debt that they may incur while still

completely deducting interest payments from their taxes, and
(iii) half of the existing second mortgage debt was used to

finance renovations and therefore would not be counted against

10
the $100,000 limit on post-acquisition indebtedness.

For most

households, these assumptions lead to straightforward calculations of the amount of available tax-deductible borrowing.

For

households who refinanced their first mortgage, we do not have
information on the remaining principal on their acquisition
loan.

We impute

this using aggregate data on fixed-rate

mortgage terms in the year when the home was purchased.6

home equity.

appear reluctant to borrow against their home equity,

although

the reasons for such behavior are not well understood (see Venti.

and Wise (1988)).

Assuming that households headed by someone

over age 65 would not borrow,

the stock of available equity is

$1.86 trillion.
We also calculated the pool of tax-deductible borrowing
that would be associated with limits below $100,000 on the
amount of second mortgage debt.

A limit

of $50,000 would reduce

the stock of available equity to $1.90 trillion.

Even with such

modest limits on borrowing, the diffuse distribution of home
equity makes the amount of potential borrowing quite large.
Our final calculation concerns the amount of consumer debt

that could be replaced by home equity borrowing.

We tabulated

the fraction of reported consumer debt that was held by homeowners and that could be replaced by mortgage debt.
if a homeowner reported $120,000 of consumer debt,

Our

tabulations show that 52.2% of unsecured consumer debt (which
totalled $254 billion in the 1985 SIP? population) could be
replaced by tax-deductible housing debt.

For a broader credit

aggregate consisting of unsecured consumer debt plus vehicle
debt ($403 billion), 55.9% could have been replaced with

borrowing backed by home equity.9 This suggests that the longrun effects of the 1986 and 1987 tax reforms may be a sig-

nificant reallocation of consumer borrowing from traditional
consumer debt to mortgage debt.

evidence.

The data suggest a

rough correspondence between the rise in second mortgages during
the early

1980s

and the decline in private saving.

The limited

information on second mortgage borrowing before 1980, however,
largely precludes formal statistical

analysis of the link

between changes in mortgage borrowing and consumption.
This suggests the need for alternative data sources for

addressing the impact of second mortgages on household saving.
An ideal data set for this project would include longitudinal
information on household income and consumption,

first and

second mortgage debt and other types of consumer borrowing, and
other factors such as wealth that might affect spending decisions.

Panel

data might permit some controls for the obvious

problem of population heterogeneity that clouds the interpretation of any cross-sectional results

on saving behavior.

9Our calculations assume that household behavior and asset
prices will not adjust in response to the new rules on interest
deductibility. Manchester (1988) discusses a variety of such
general equilibrium effects.

13

Moreover, it would need evidence on access to second mortgage
debt, since it is difficult to interpret the simple correlation

between borrowing and consumption without some exogenous
variation in borrowing opportunities.
While some data sets (i.e. the PSID) include the data
outlined above, they are ruled out for this project because they
10

were conducted before the recent growth of second mortgages.

The data set that comes closest to satisfying our requirements
is the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)

so our data may fail to reflect the behavior of

The second limitation of SIPP results from steps to protect

respondent anonymity.

The public use file reports total

The market value of the respondent's home

is top-coded at $200,000 and monthly income

is also capped,

We filed a

The net worth of households with

second mortgages averages approximately $22,000 below that of
all other homeowners, and roughly $4,000 below that of homeowners with one mortgage (the "with one mortgage" category can be

calculated from the data in Table 4).

The

mortgages are used by households with significant accrued
capital gains.

The household's net home equity has a statisti-

cally insignificant and substantively trivial effect on second
mortgage probabilities (a ten thousand dollar increase in
housing equity lowers the chance of obtaining a second mortgage
during 1985 by below one tenth of one percent, when the average
risk of acquiring a mortgage was 6.5%).

on the potential effects of tighter limits on second mortgage

borrowing or of restrictions on interest tax deductibility must
await a structural model of the borrowing decision.
Our analysis of the second mortgage market has considered

only one channel by which these instruments affect capital
formation.

A central question for future work is how the rise

of HELs and second mortgages has altered incentives for residential capital formation.

The U.S. tax code encourages investment

in owner-occupied housing rather than nonresidential capital;
the relative illiquidity of housing investments partly counteracts these tax incentives.

The evolution of new institutions

that facilitate borrowing against housing equity may ultimately

encourage resource allocation toward the housing sector.
Increased housing liquidity may also affect housing market
dynamics.

The increased availability of second mortgage borrow-

discress sales may fall and because households will find it
easier co borrow and expand cheir exiscing homes instead of
moving.

This may affect the set of homes which "trickle down"

from one set of homeowners co another, with unclear welfare
effects.
