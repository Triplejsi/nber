TRENDS IN WORKER DEMAND FOR UNION REPRESENTATION

ABSTRACT
The dramatic decline in the demand for union representationamong

nonunion workers over the last decade is investigated using data on worker
preferences for union representationfrom four surveys conducted in 1977,
1980, 1982, and 1984.

Relatively little of the decline can be accounted for

by shifts in labor force structure.

However, virtually all of the decline

is correlated with an increase in the satisfaction of nonunion workers with
their jobs and a decline in nonunion workers' beliefs that unions are able
to improve wages and working conditions.

1987, 1989) where I conclude, based on the analysis of data from a variety of
sources,

that 1) only a small fraction of the decline in unionization can be

accounted for by shifts in labor force structure, 2) there has been a
substantial drop in demand for union representationamong nonunion workers
that cannot be accounted for by shifts in labor force structure, and 3) there
has been a substantial increase in employer resistance to unionization that
is likely to have made it more difficult

(1985) and by Freeman and Medoff (1984) support these conclusions.

In this study I focus on one aspect of the decline in unionization,

and

that is the trend in demand for union representationamong nonunion workers.
My earlier work on this problem relied in part on data from the 1977 Quality
of Employment Survey (QES) and a survey conducted by Lewis Harris and
Associates for the AFL-CIO (AFL) in 1984.

Here the analysis is extended to

nonunion workers, asking whether he/she would vote for union representation
on their current job if a secret ballot election were held.

The response to

this question (No—O, Yes—l) is interpreted as an indicator of the worker's
demand for unionization.

All four surveys also contain varying degrees of

information regarding job satisfaction and perceptions

of the instrumentality

of unions in improving wages and working conditions.

These samples consist of all

of VFU among nonunion workers show

that 38.6% of 663 workers in the the QES, 37.8% of 1242 workers in the NLSE,
43.5% of 1339 workers in the NLSG, and 33.7% of 935 workers in the AFL survey

These surveys contain only a single overall measure of job

This result is consistent

across all four surveys.

The linear probability model of VFU among nonunion workers was
reestimated including additionally the measure of overall job satisfaction.7
This multivariate analysis confirms the finding that the probability that a
worker desires union representationis strongly and significantly related to
job satisfaction.

Otherwise

equivalent nonunion workers who are satisfied

with their job are estimated to be 27.2 percentage points (se—2.5) less

Table 2 contains breakdowns of the satisfaction and instrumentality

The analogous statistics for union members are included in table 2 in
order to shed some light on the question of whether the increase in
satisfaction among nonunion workers is likely to be an artifact of
differences in survey design between the QES and the AFt survey.

In fact,

the patterns for union workers are quite different than for nonunion workers.

There are no significant differences in any of the three measures of

7

satisfaction between 1977 and 1984.

These findings suggest that the results

for the nonunion workers are unlikely to be an artifact of differences

in

survey design.
The reasons for the increase in perceived job satisfaction among

nonunion workers are not clear.

Satisfaction with pay may reflect how

workers evaluate their pay relative to either their best alternatives or some
norm that they consider equitable.

Given the well known stagnation in real

earnings since the mid 1970's, the general increase in worker satisfaction
with pay suggests that the standards against which workers judge their wages
fell.

In other words, the period from 1977 through 1984 may be marked by

declining expectations,

and this may be a cause of the decrease in demand for

union representation.
With regard to union instrumentality, the numbers in the second part of
table 2 suggest that, while most nonunion workers still believe that unions
improve the wages and working conditions of workers,

the fraction of nonunion

workers who believe that unions are effective in this dimension fell
significantly from 1977 to 1984 (p-value<.OOl).

Thus,

nonunion workers are

less likely to believe that unions can help with a central area of concern on
the job.

There is no corresponding decline among union workers so that, as

It remains to demonstrate

the links between worker preferences for

union representation and these subjective measures of job satisfaction and
union instrumentality.

While not presented here, simple cross tabulations

the data show that nonunion worker preferences

An important testis to determine how much of the 4.4 percentage point
decline in the demand for union representation among nonunion workers between
1977 and 1984 estimated above can be accounted for by the increase in job
satisfaction and the decline in perceptions of unions' ability to improve
jobs.

A version of the linear probabilitymodel of VFU that includes the

three measures of job satisfaction and the single measure of union
instrumentality

along with the full set of labor force structure control

variables was estimated over the sample of nonunion workers from the QES and
the AFL survey.

IV. Final Remarks

In light of this evidence, what can the union movement do to recoup its
losses?

The results on the relationship between worker demand for union

representation on the one hand and job satisfaction and union instrumentality
on the other suggest that the task is to convince workers that unions can
play an effective role in the workplace.

The union movement has begun to

define new organizing strategies for this purpose, but their task is
difficult at best until workers feel that unions can help with aspects of
their jobs that they are not satisfied with (AFL-CIO, 1985).
The role of increased employer resistance to union organizing activity
has not been considered here, but other work (Freeman and Medoff,

1984;

Farber, 1987; Farber, 1989) suggests that this is another important and
related factor in the decline of unionization.

Concern about employer

resistance has prompted the union movement to call for reform of the National
Labor Relations Act to provide an environment where current employer
practices

to discourage union organizingwill be less effective.

However,

until our society as a whole is more favorably disposed toward unions, such
reform will be difficult to achieve.
One

recurring

theme in the debate over the future of unions in the

private sector is that the competitiveness

of the economy has increased

dramatically and that labor unions may be less viable in such an economic
environment. Unions need to convince workers that they offer real value in
the modern competitive economy.
