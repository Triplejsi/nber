The relative magnitudes of the employment and

unemployment effects for different types of shifts should thus enable us to

The sales growth data used to calculate

these shifts are from the

Employment Opportunity Pilot Project (EOPP) Survey of Firms in 1980 and
1982.

EOPP sites, we also perform a similar analysis using Census of Industry data
across states from 1972, 1977, and 1982.

Real sales growth measures at the

industry level and a variety of employment and unemployment data for each
state are used in this part of the analysis.

The results of this study can be briefly summarized here.

We find that

demand shifts across local markets are negatively related to unemployment
rates and positively to employment

growth rates, thereby indicating major

employment effects of demand shifts between areas.

effect3. The results therefore suggest that the unemployment effects of
demand shifts are high only when adjustments involve costly migration between
markets. Wage rigiditIes which are observed at declining firms and training
needs at growing ones might also contribute to these effects.

Finally,

estimated nonlinearities in employment effects and rising dispersion in
unemployment across areas also suggest that demand shifts may have raised
aggregate unemployment in the U.S. in recent years.

The 1982 follow-up to the EOPP Survey of Firms asked the following

It is this variable that will be used to measure

sales growth across firms.

We can also calculate employment and wage growth at the firm for these
years.

Both the 1980 and 1982 surveys also asked for the number of full-time

and part-time employees

in the firms.

In the 1980 survey this question was

asked for the current time (i.e., at the time of the survey) as well as for
July and December of 1979.

In the 1982 survey employment size was also gauged

for the current time and for July and December of 1980 and 1981.

Using the

employment figures for December of 1979 and 1981, it is therefore possible to

are in order regarding the interpretation of sales growth

a measure of labor demand shift.

Differences in sales growth across firms

presumably reflect differences in output growth, assuming that inventories
adjust relatively quickly to their equilibrium levels.

Output changes can

reflect shifts on the supply-side or demand-side of the product market, where
the former might be caused by changes in technology
prices.

Exogenous

and/or relative factor

changes in output prices, such as occurred for the oil and

petrochemical industries during the oil shocks of the 1910's, can also result
in these changes.

All of these forces will create shifts in labor demand through the
standard "scale effects" on employment which move in the same direction as the
output change.

While changes in other factor prices can also have

substitution effects" on labor demand, these would generally move in the
opposite direction from the output changes.

Thus we can infer the relative

importance of these effects from the sign of the correlation between sales

growth and employment or unemployment;

if sales

are positively correlated (or sales growth and unemployment are negatively
correlated),

This implies that the vast majority

reflect some measurement-error in the sales growth measure or random "noise"
in the data.

But these results are consistent with those of Leonard (1987)

and Dunne et. al. (1989) who find that most of the variation of employment
growth at the firm-level is within-area and industry.

Sales Growth and Uneaploy.ent/EsployaentEffects at the Site Level

In this section of the paper we analyze the relationship between sales
growth,

unemployment and employment growth at the local labor market level.

Firm-level data on sales and employment growth are aggregated to the site
level, of which there are 28 in the EOPP data.

These data are then merged

with Census data on unemployment rates and other labor market characteristics
for the same areas.
In aggregating

sales growth measures to the site-level, we have sample-

The observed

contribute to these results in some cases.
Finally, estimated nonlinearities in the effects of sales growth on
employment across local areas and evidence of rising dispersion in local
unemployment rates suggest that aggregate unemployment have risen as a result
of demand shifts in the late 1970's and 1980's.
