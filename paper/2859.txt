February 1989
BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO REDUCE HOUSING EQUITY

ABSTRACT
The majority of the wealth of most elderly is in the form of
housing

It is often claimed that many elderly would transfer wealth from
housing to finance current consumption expenditure, were it not for the large
equity.

transaction costs associated with changes in housing equity.

This is the

rationale for a market in reverse annuity mortgages.
This paper considers
whether transaction costs, understood to include the psychic costs associated
with leaving friends, family surroundings, and the like, prevent the elderly

from making choices that would improve their financial circumstances.

The

analysis considers jointly the probability that an elderly family will move
and the housing equity that is chosen when a move occurs. The results are
based on the decisions of the Retirement History Survey sample between 1969
and 1919. Relative to the potential gains from a reallocation of wealth
between housing equity and other assets, transaction costs are very
large.
Nonetheless,

the effect on the housing equity of the elderly is very small.

On balance, were all elderly to move and choose optimum levels of housing
equity, the amount of housing equity would be increased slightly.
Most
elderly are not liquidity constrained.

And contrary to standard formulations
of the life cycle hypothesis, the typical elderly family has no desire to
reduce housing equity.

The desired reduction of housing equity is largest

among families with low income and high housing wealth, but even in this case
the desired reductions are rather small.

And these desired reductions are

more than offset by the desired increases of other families, especially those
with high income and low housing wealth. Thus, consistent with the previous
findings of Venti and Wise and of Feinstein and McFadden,

limited demand may

explain the absence of a market for reverse annuity mortgages.

and David A. Wise*

The majority of the wealth of most elderly is in the form of housing
equity.

This housing wealth, it is claimed,

for the elderly as they age.

is a potential source of support

It is further claimed that many elderly would

choose to transfer wealth from housing to finance current consumption
expenditure,

were it not for the large transaction costs associated with

changes in housing equity.

In the past, it has typically been necessary for

such families to move to withdraw wealth from housing.

Indeed,

the rational

for a market in reverse annuity mortgages has been that the elderly would like

to withdraw wealth from housing were it possible to do so without incurring
the large transaction costs associated with moving.

whether these claims are correct.

This paper considers

Two related questions

are addressed:

Given the predetermined financial and other circumstances of families
as they approach retirement ages, would the typical elderly family like
to withdraw wealth from housing?
Are the transaction costs of moving large, and do they constrain
adjustments in the housing wealth of the elderly as they age?

The paper provides a clear answer to the first question.

Jere all

there would be little change in housing wealth on average.

In particular,

from a reallocation of wealth between housing equity and other assets, the
relative gain, in these tens, necessary to justify moving is typically very
large.

Our evidence suggests a strong preference for remaining in existing

housing as the elderly grow older.

On the other hand, that the housing equity

of the elderly is not typically reduced as they age is not explained by the
high transaction costs of moving.

The goal of the analysis is to estimate the housing equity that the
elderly would prefer.

With this goal in mind, we consider the allocation of

bequeathable wealth between housing and other assets, conditional, on current
income and other circumstances.

Suppose that the value of housing equity

versus other wealth can be captured by the simple function

The difference apparently reflects the fact that, on average,

stayers.

families who move have more to gain from wealth reallocation than families who
don't move.

That is, to the extent that a reallocation of housing equity is a

motivation for moving, the difference should be greater for those who have
chosen to move than for those who have not.

As emphasized above, however, it

is clear that this is not the major reason for moving.

The mean difference among movers with high incomes and high housing equity is

Among those with low income and low housing

Table

2b is analogous

to table 2a but the disturbance term in the housing

equation is assumed to reflect desired housing choice, instead of a
maximization error or deviation from the optimal level.

To incorporate

the

disturbance term, a random draw is made from the estimated error
distribution--normalwith mean 0 and variance 0.2008•W--each time that desired
housing is predicted.

Although this does not affect the expected value of

housing equity, since the expected value of v is zero, it does affect the
absolute values of the deviation.

This can be seen by comparing the values in
For example, the average of the absolute

values of the desired change over all families is $5,377 when the disturbance
term is not accounted for and $12,766 when it is.
The values in tables 2a and 2b indicate the change in housing equity that
would occur if transaction cost were zero.

On average, the desired change in

housing equity may be substantial.
But, also on average, the desire is not to reduce, but rather to increase

The desired changes are positive on average and are greater for movers

than for stayers.

And,

the desired increases

are much greater for families

with high income and low housing wealth than for families with low income and
high housing equity.

This pattern is especially evident among movers.

On

average movers with high income and low housing equity would like to increase
housing equity by 72 percent; the average mover with low income and high
housing equity would like to reduce housing equity by only 3.5 percent.

Were

there no moving transaction costs, and all families moved to optimize the

allocation of wealth between housing and other assets, housing equity would
increase by 4.9 percent on average; the typical family would not change
housing equity, as indicated by the median percent change of 0.6 percent.
