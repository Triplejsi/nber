DEVALUATION CRISES AND THE MACROECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES
OF POSTPONED ADJUSTMENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

ABSTRACT

This paper develops our analytical model to explore the relationship
between the dynamics of macroeconomic adjustment and the timing of the
implementation of an adjustment program featuring an official devaluation.
The effects of postponing adjustment depend on the source of the original
shock,

In the case of fiscal expansion, postponement implies a larger

eventual official devaluation and greater deviations of macroeconomic
variables from their steady-state values.
shocks,

For adverse terms of trade

postponement does not affect the size of the eventual official

devaluation, but does magnify the amount of post-devaluation overshooting by
key macroeconomic variables.

Introduction

An important issue in the design of stabilization programs refers to
the :iminz of different policies.

In particular,

determining the consequ-

ences of alternative timings of devaluations has for a long time concerned
policymakers in the developing countries. In spite of this policy
interest the literature on stabilization and devaluation has not analyzed
this issue in detail.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a general

equilibrium dynamic model to explore the relationship between the dynamics
of macroeconomic adjustment and the timing of the implementation of a
stabilization program that includes a nominal devaluation as its principal
component.

/

In

particular, we explore the effects of postponing

adjustment on the cumulative deviations of key macroeconomic variables
from their steady-state values and on the degree of overshooting of these
values following the implementation of adjustment measures.
The model is derived from well-articulated micro foundations and
distinguishes between equilibrium and disequilibrium movements in real
exchange rates.

We investigate the characteristics of two different types of

exchange rate crises:

(a) those provoked by inconsistent fiscal policies

and (b) those generated by exogenous terms of trade shocks.

A central

aspect of our discussion is determining conditions under which a nominal
devaluation will be required to render the adjustment process effective.

on a particular aspect of the adjustment process, without providing a
general and integrated picture that "fits" (or is consistent with) the
more salient stylized facts. See, for example, Blanco and Garber (1986),
Connolly et al. (1987), Rodriguez (1978), Khan and Lizondo (1987), Krugman
(1979) and Edwards (1983).

This is, indeed, an important policy issue, since the cole of devaluations

Macroeconomic Polity, Real Exchange Rates and
and Devaluation Crises: The Stylized Facts

In this section we briefly analyze the circumstances preceding 20 major
devaluation crises in developing countries.

Our main interest is to provide

a simple "list' of the most salient atylized faota

that, we believe, should

be captured by a unified model that deals with devaluation crises and macro-

economic adjustment processes. We focus both on policy induced disturbances

of the following endogenous variables:

(1) real exchange rates; (2) the

current account; (3) the monetary system's foreign assets position;
(4) the black market premium; and (5) real wages.

The Sample
Table 1 contains the list of the 20 devaluation episodes analyzed in

this paper.

The choice of countries in the sample was basically determined

by data availability; only those major devaluation episodes for which data
on (most) of the variables of interest were available were incorporated into

This table also

contains data on the amount of each nominal devaluation measured as the
percentage change of the official exchange rate with respect to the U.S.
dollar.

It is interesting to note that all of these devaluations were fol-

lowed by some kind of predetermined regime (either fixed or passive crawl)
and not by a freely floating nominal rate, as most theoretical models of
exchange rate collapse have assumed (Krugman, 1979; Flood and Garber 1984;
Obstfeld 1986)

.

In

the model we developed below we take this important

stylized fact into account and deal with exchange rate crisis where the official exchange rate is fixed at a new (higher) level after the devaluation.

Also,

in 14 of the 20 episodes the current account ratio experienced a

worsening in the two years before the crisis,

In fact, in some of these

episodes the current account to GDP ratio reached remarkable levels.

In

Kenya and Israel 1971 the deficit was approximately equal to one-fourth of
GDP!

tendency,

present in most countries, for the ratio of net foreign assets to

that countries have a well-established desired level of reserves to which

This characteristic, which has been ignored in the

literature, is explicitly incorporated in our model.
Regarding real exchange rates, in 15 out of the 19 countries wsth
relevant data the bilateral real exchange rate experienced a real apprecia
tion in the three years prior to the devaluation; in 13 out of the 19 cases
there also was a real appreciation of the multilateral RER during the period
immediately preceding the crisis.

The average real appreciation during the

3 years preceding the devaluation crisis was almost 9.2 percent, while the

real multilateral appreciation was 9.01 (see Appendix,

Table A.3). 1/

These

real appreciations were the result of domestic rates of inflation that
increasingly exceeded the world rate of inflation.

A set of

x2

tests,

in

fact, indicate that as the crisis date approached the rate of CPI inflation

in the devaluing countries became more distinct from that of the fixed rate
control group.

This evidence is particularly important for determining our

modelling strategy. What these data suggest is that devaluation decisions
are based on the behavior of (at least) two indicators:
and the real exchange rates.

Summary

The data discussed in this section provide a fairly clearcut pattern
regarding the stylized facts surrounding a large number of devaluation
crises in the developing countries. These facts--which we believe an
adequate model of devaluation crises should capture--can be briefly
summarized

a.

as follows:

Historically the vast majority of devaluation crises have been

preceded by loose and inconsistent macroeconomic policies.
the

evidence shows

In particular,

that fiscal policy in the devaluing countries as a group

was significantly more expansive than in a control group of fixers.

In a nontrivial number of episodes we detected a significant
worsening in the international terms of trade immediately before the crisis.

III.

The Model

In this section we develop a model of a typical developing country
which is designed to trace the dynamic response of certain key macroeconomic
variables to a variety of shocks that eventually culminate in a devaluation
episode.

The model is able to generate dynamic responses which mimic quite

closely the stylized facts described above.

It turns out that, for a given

shock whioh eventually results in adjustment-ca-devaluation, the primary
determinants of the path followed by domestic macroeconomic variables are
the nature of the eventual macroeconomic adjustment to the shock and the
magnitude of the associated devaluation.

exportables while reducing that of importables and nontraded goods.

from Khan and Montiel in that it incorporates a dual exchange rate market

To analyze the workings of the model, we consider the effects of the
two types of shocks which in Section II we associated with a devaluation
crisis- -an expansionary fiscal shock consisting of an increase in govern-

We

derive a dynamic model that is able to capture these common features of
balance of payments crises.

An important property of the model is that it

allows us to analyze the consequences of different timings of adjustment.
The opening section of the paper contains a brief discussion of 20
major devaluation episodes in the developing countries. From this analysis
we derive a list of "stylized facts" that we believe models of macroeconomic
aj'astment should account for.

In Section III the model is presented. The

model is based on fully articulated micro-principles and considers an
economy that produces three goods

The public holds domestic and foreign

money, and there are dual exchange rates.

An important feature 0f the model

is that the Central Bank has a well-defined demand for international
reserves.

In Section IV we use the model to analyze how the economy reacts

(1) an increase in government consumption of

to two types of shocks:

nontradables financed with domestic credit creation;
shock to terms of trade.
followed by inflation,

and (2) a negative

We show that in this model the adjustment path

the parallel market premium and net foreign assets correspond closely oo the

stylized facts described in Section II of the paper.
A central result of our analysis refers to the consequences of postponing the adjqstment when the Central Bank has a well-defined target for
international reserves.

We show that the effects of postponement will

depend on the type of shook.

If the disturbance is a fiscal expansion.

postponing the adjustment will require a larger official devaluation. boyever,

this relationship between the timing of the devaluation and its

magnitude is not linear.

If the postponement period is doubled the cequited

magnitude of the devaluation will not double.

the adjustment

In partiouloc.

the longer adjustment is postponed, the larger will be the deviations of the

matro variables from their steady-state values,

When adjustment is finally

implemented the macro variables will tend to overshoot their steady state
values.

The extent of overshooting will depend on the postponement period:

a delayed adjustment magnifies the extent of the overshooting.

For the case of a negative terms of trade disturbance, the size of the
official devaluation will be unaffected by the timing of the adjustment.
Furthermore, the longer the adjustment is postponed, the smaller will be the
peak deviation of the macrovariables (except for reserves and money) froa

However,

as in the case of fiscal shock, folIov

ing adjustment the required degree of overshooting of the macro variablea

will be magnified by postponement.
An

mportant conclusion of our analysis on the effects of the timirg

of adjustment is that the observed pattern of continuously rising black
market premla, rising inflation, and increasing current account deficits
can be unambiguously inferred only in the context of
sufficiently post-

poned adjustment.

The suggestion it that "devaluation crisis" episodes

in developing countries have resulted not so much from the occurrence of
domestit or external shocks, but from a failure to adjust promptly in
response to such shocks.
Although the model presented here goes a long way toward tying
together the more salient features of devaluation crises in developing
countries

it has some limitations.

at least two important issues,

the

In particular, it fails to incorporate

First, since there

is no capital mobility

official rate is available only for current transactions and there

are no Leacagea between markets) the role of capital flight is not investigated.

Second

since our model exhibits continuous full employment,

the

dynamics of real output over the course of the crisis-adjustment period have
been omitted.

while both phenomena are of substantial empirical and

anslytica, interest,

their incorporation into our framework would add

substantially to the model'

complexity and they therefore remain topics

for future research, j/

interest rate differentials would result in a system with three state
variables,
