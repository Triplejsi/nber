DEVELOPING COUNTRY BORROWING AND DOMESTIC WEALTH

ABSTRA

We show that across developing countries, external debt to private

creditors rises more than proportionately with income. We then develop a
simple theoretical model consistent with this phenomenon and also consistent
with the well-documented relationship between capital market development and

growth. Our framework stresses information asymmetries at the level of
individual borrowers as the source of frictions in world capital markets.

Because of moral hazard problems, marginal products of capital and

borrowing—lending spreads are higher in poorer countries. In a two—country
version of the model, we demonstrate the possibility of a siphoning effect
which exacerbates the costs of transfers. Also because of the siphoning
effect, increased wealth in the rich country can stunt investment in the poor
country.

I. Introduction
The standard neoclassical model of trade and growth predicts that

rich—country savers will lend to investors in high—marginal—product—of—capital

poor countries. After the deregulation of international capital markets
the

in

19608, the 1970s indeed witnessed a broad expansion of lending from

industrialized countries to the developing world. However, for certain

features

of the data, the standard model does not seem to provide the simplest

explanation. For example, during the 1970s middle income' developing

capita

countries were able to borrow more per

than poorer countries. Using

data from 1980 for a cross-section of seventy countries, we show that for each

percentage point increase in per capita income, per capita external debt to
private creditors tends to rise significantly

region (Africa, Asia, and Latin

America).

Our ala is to provide a natural explanation of this evidence which is
also consistent with the well—documented positive relationship between capital

market development and growth (Goldsmith (1969) and Mckinnon (1973)1. The
framework here stresses asymmetric information at the level of individual
borrowers as a source of (endogenously—derived) frictions in world capital

markets.1 A positive relation between external borrowing and the state of
development can emerge because in wealthier countries firms are better

capitalized. Informational problems consequently have less impact, resulting

1Our analysis draws on recent developments in the closed—economy literature on
interactions between the real and financial sectors; see Gertler (1988) for a
survey. To abstract from sovereign risk, we assume that there is a
supranational legal authority, capable of enforcing contracts across borders.
Hence our analysis is really as much a model of capital flows between
Manhattan and the Bronx as between Japan and India.

finance.

Thus even in a world of perfectly integrated capital markets, In which
riskiess rates are equalized, marginal products of capital can differ across

nations. An Important empirical Implication Is that the spread between
borrowing and lending rates should be larger in poorer countries, which most
development economists take as a stylized fact.
Section II of the paper presents some simple correlations between

national income and borrowing. A small-country model Is presented in section
ru and a two—country general equilibrium version is given in section IV.

value of the debt, since the decline in wealth exacerbates the

information—induced loan market inefficiencies. Also, a rise In capital

funds from the poor country. In the conclusions, we discuss some possible
alternative explanations for the positive relation between capital Inflows and
domestic wealth.

II. External Debt and GNP for Developing Countries
In Table 1, we present 1980 data on income and external borrowing for

seventy developing countries, listed In order of GNP per capita The second
column lists external debts owed to private lenders; the third column also
includes debts owed to other governments and to multilateral credit agencies

(e.g., the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank). A casual
comparison of column one with either column two or three indicates a strong

correlation between GNP and external borrowing. Table 2 contains two sets of

regressions, both using the log of GNP per capita as the explanatory variable.

In the first, the dependent variable is the log of total external debt per

capita. Over the entire sample 2, the coefficient on GNP was 1.05, with a
standard error of .08. Separate regressions for Asia, Africa, and
Latin America yield similar results.

One problem with using total external debt to measure country borrowing
is that the component consisting of official (public) debt is probably best

viewed as foreign aid. Whereas most official debt is senior in principle, it
is junior to private debt in practice. Though technically, developing-country
debtors have promptly repaid official debt, in most cases official creditors
have made new loans in excess of any principal and Interest repayments due.
[See Bulow and Rogoff (1988)].

In the second set of regressions reported in Table 2, the dependent

variable Includes only external debt owed to private creditors. Note that the
coefficients are always larger than one and the difference Is significant over

the full sample.3 Again, this simple relation explains a very large share of
the variation In external borrowing across countries, and the coefficients are

relatively stable across regimes.4

2Nepal, which had zero private debt per capita, had to be excluded when the
regressions were run in logs. Because It is poor, Nepal's exclusion biases
the estimated coefficients downwards.

3The results are quite robust to excluding trade credits and/or short term
debt from the regressions. However, when "Micronesian" countries with
populations under one million are included, the coefficients become smaller
and the standard errors larger.
4We also ran a regression that included the growth rate of per capita GNF from
1980 to 1986 as a proxy for expected productivity change. The variable,
however, was unimportant. One can also Interpret the regional regressions as
a crude attempt to control for differences in expected productivity across
countries — the idea being that, while technology may differ between Brazil
and Nigeria, it is less likely to significantly differ between Brazil and
Argentina. Obviously, it would be desirable to explore the dynamics of the

value

and the market value of loans becomes much

weaker.5 There did not exist a secondary market for bank loans as of 1980,
but most of the private loans were indexed to short—term interest rates. Thus
any capital gains or losses would mainly have to involve sovereign risk. The
fact that most debtor nations were still receiving new funds in 1980 suggests

that expectations of default were still quite low. Almost all sovereign debt
to private creditors is of equal priority (for a rationale see Bulow and
Rogoff (1988)), so countries can generally only get new loans only if their
old loans are valued near par.6

III. A Siill-Country Model with Agency Coats of Investment
Our goal throughout is to provide the simplest possible model capable of

illustrating our main points. Before turning to the two-country case, we
first develop and analyze a small country framework. We consider an open
economy inhabited by a large number of identical individuals; the economy is

small in the sense that It cannot affect the world Interest rate. There are
two periods and one good. The representative individual Is risk neutral and
cares only about consuming in period two:

where c is her second-period consumption.

Entering period

one,

each person is endowed with W units of the

consumption good.7 There exist two ways to convert this endowment into final
period consumption. The first option is to lend abroad at the (gross) world
riskiess interest rate r; the alternative is to Invest in a risky technology.

In particular, each person in the country has a project. All projects are
identical cx ante, and yield cx post returns as follows: k units invested in
period one yield 9 units of second-period output with probability i(k), and
zero units with probability I —

Thus, investment raises the probability that the

individual's project will yield a high level of output, and the marginal

expected return to investment is diminishing.9 We assume that output
realizations are independent across the projects of different individuals.
If an individual wants to invest more than her endowment in her project,

can include any future income which is collateralizable. The distinction
between current and future endowment is not important here. It is important in
the two—country case since the world equilibrium will depend on the total
supply of current endowment; see below.

where the last term is the individual's return from risk—free investments
abroad, and the first two terms represent the expected net return on her
project.

The information structure is as follows: Lenders may observe a borrower's

initial wealth and the total amount she borrows. What the borrower does with
the funds, however, is her private knowledge. In particular, she may secretly

lend abroad rather than invest in her project. Whereas investment is
unobservable, lenders can freely observe realized output. The production
function n() is common knowledge.
If there were no information asymmetries, the individual would invest to
the point where the expected marginal project return equals the world interest

rate. Let k denote this first—best level of investment; thus

So long as Z9 differs from Zb, k will differ from its first—best optimum

The problem is that the borrower's marginal benefit

from investing depends not only on the marginal gain in expected output, but

on the change in her expected obligation to lenders, as well. We will
subsequently refer to (7) as the "incentive constraint."

If the borrower could promise lenders a fixed payment

feasible, however, since the project yields nothing in the bad state. Since
the borrower's consumption must be non—negative, an important constraint on

The incentive problem emerging here is classified as moral hazard because the
informational asymmetry arises after contracting. See Dixit (1987) for an
application to international trade.

The solution is as follows13: The contract pays lenders zero in the

(More generally, the contract always pays

lenders the maximum feasible amount in the bad state.) This serves to
minimize the spread between Z5 and Zb, thereby minimizing the difference
between the borrower's decision rule for k (eq. (7)1 and the socially
efficient rule (eq. (6)1.14 Similarly, equation (3) is binding; 4 +

Now consider the link between external borrowing and country wealth.

External borrowing will rise with W if a dollar increase in wealth induces

more than a dollar increase in investment. This will be the case if
diminishing returns set in slowly, i.e., ir(k) is small relative to ir'(k).
(Inspection of eq. (ii) indicates that the magnitude of

varies inversely

with the absolute value of i(k)/i' (k). ) Thus, to the extent that per capita
GNP can be considered a proxy for per-capita wealth, the framework is capable
of explaining the positive relation between external borrowing and output for

developing countries, documented in section II. The informational problem is
of course key to the result; when the incentive constraint is not binding,

external borrowing simply declines a dollar for each dollar increase in
wealth; this occurs since investment is no longer influenced by changes in W.

A corresponding result is that the spread between the marginal product of
capital and the world riskless interest rate will vary across countries, and

will in particular be larger the poorer the country. Note that cross-country
differences in marginal products of capital may arise here even though the
world capital market is perfectly integrated (the riskiess rate is the same

everywhere).

Finally, consider how changes in the world interest rate influence

opportunity cost of Investing rises, so for any given value of Z9, k must

decline. The MR curve moves inward as well. Some combination of a rise in
2g and a fall in k is necessary for lenders to continue to receive a
competitive return. The interest-elasticity of investment in the
information—constrained case may or may not be greater than in the full

information case. It is greater if

This will likely be the case

if the initial amount borrowed, k — W, is large or if the production function
is sufficiently concave so that the decline in k is not enough to offset the
higher rate of interest.

20

None of the countries listed in Table 1 represents more than a tiny

fraction of the world's GNP. However, taken together, they are economically
larger than Japan. Therefore, for some issues involving multi-lateral
transfers of wealth (e.g., due to a global restructuring of Third World debt).

it is of interest to analyze the general equilibrium implications of these
nations' capital market activities.

IV.

The Two-Country General Equilibrii Case
Suppose

there

are two countries of equal population size, country R

("rich") and country P ('poor"). In each country, a percent of the
individuals are "entrepreneurs" and 1—u percent are "lenders." All
individuals have the same utility function, given by equatIon (1). That is,

20The adjustment of k in response to a change in r is given by

Each entrepreneur owns and manages a risky investment project. The
project technology is the same across entrepreneurs and across countries, and

is given by equation (2) above. As before, if an entrepreneur wants to Invest
more than her endowment she has to borrow, so that equation (3) still applies.

Lenders do not have projects; their only option is to lend to entrepreneurs.

The information structure is the same as in the small country case.

Lenders observe a project's realized output, but cannot observe the capital

input. They cannot directly see whether the entrepreneur is secretly lending

to other entrepreneurs.
If there were no information asymmetries, the following three equations
would characterize the world equilibrium:

Thus lenders must be worse off

under asymmetric information. Equation (20) is drawn as the positively—slop
pp curve in FIgure 2.

In general, the pattern of world investment depends on the agency costs
of lending In one country relative to the other, which In turn depends on th
net asset positions of entrepreneurs across countries.23 To illustrate this
point, suppose that the wealth of rich country entrepreneurs Improves, but
that both total world endowment and the endowments of poor country

entrepreneurs remain unchanged. Consider, for example, a redistribution of
wealth In the rich country from lenders to entrepreneurs. This corresponds
an upward rotation In the pp curve in Figure 2; the WV curve remains

unchanged. kR rises and k falls. The decline in the agency costs of finan
in the rich country induces a "siphoning" of investment funds from the poor

country.24

The increased demand for funds by rich country entrepreneurs driv

up the world interest rate, drawing capital out of the poor country.

Entrepreneurs in the poor country lose rents as a result of the

23An important difference between our model and earlier frameworks emphasizin,
capital market frictions (e.g., Persson and Svenson (1987)) is that the
Imperfections and the forms of the financial contracts are derived
endogenously. An important exception Is Greenwood and Williamson
(forthcoming) who develop a monetary model of International business
fluctuations under Incomplete Information. Another related paper is Samolyk
(1988), who studies the transmission of regional disturbances in financial
markets.

capital flight. This loss of rents Is aggravated by the rise in the world
interest rate. Lenders In the poor country benefit from the rise in interest
rates but as long as the poor country Is a net borrower, its national income
must fall.

A fall in the wealth of poor country entrepreneurs similarly induces

siphoning of capital from the poor to the rich country. The reduced
efficiency of lending in the poor country causes funds to flow out to the

increases while

In contrast to the previous case, the world interest

high marginal product of capital poor country to the low marginal product of
capital rich country depresses the equilibrium Interest rate.
Now consider a transfer of wealth from the poor country to the rich.

In

particular, suppose that_t units of wealth are taken from each citizen of the
poor country and are distributed evenly among the citizens of the rich

country. This transfer can also be graphed as an upward rotation of the pp
curve In Figure 2. However, for a given change In

the pp curve shifts by

more than for our earlier example in which the transfer came from rich country

lenders. Both the increase In

and the decline In

Induce kR to rise and

to fall. The net effect on the world Interest rate is ambiguous; greater
tends to move the Interest rate up while less W' moves It down, as

discussed earlier. Note that under perfect InformatIon a similar transfer of
wealth would affect neither Investment nor the interest rate (see eqs. (12) -

(14)).
The wealth transfer naturally imposes a direct cost on the poor country.

But there may be indirect costs as well. Holding constant the world interest
rate, entrepreneurs in the poor country lose additionally because their

15

project rents decline due to the reduction in investment. Thus, to the exter
that the movement in the world interest rate is not large, the indirect

effects always magnify the costs of the transfer. If the change in the
interest rate is large (owing to highly concave production functions) then tt
exact effect on the poor country's national income depends on whether it is
net debtor or creditor in the world capital market. However, if the poor
country is small, the movement in r Is negligible so that the capital market
problems always magnify the costs of wealth transfers.

This model accordingly produces a transfer" problem in the sense that
the cost to a country of paying a foreign debt may exceed the face value of

the payments. Here the transfer problem relates to intertemporal trade rathe
than contemporaneous trade, as in the classic debate between Keynes and Ohlin
It arises because the distribution of wealth affects the allocation of
investment, due to information asymmetries.

As another variation on this theme, consider a shock which increases the
initial endowment of all Individuals in the rich country, thus Increasing the
total supply of Investment funds available to the world capital market.

Under perfect Information, capital investment would rise the same In each

country. But under asymmetric Information, there will be a siphoning effect
since the wealth of rich country entrepreneurs rises as well. Thus the
increase In investment will be greater in the rich country, and It is even
conceivable that investment may decline In the poor country.

Note that In a dynamic context, the relevant measure of a borrower's
wealth, W, includes not only lIquId assets, but any collaterallzable expected
future profits as well.25 Thus good news about future business conditions In

the rich country can also induce the slphoning effect described above.
Finally, we consider a shock to world productivity, 8. By inspection of
of equation (20). we see that a world productivity shock has no effect on the

distribution of investment capital, since 8 factors out of both sides. As in
the full Information case, the rise In 8 Increases per capita world output and

Conclusions
Across

developing countries, external debt to private creditors rises

more than proportionately with Income. Our simple model of international
finance under asymmetric Information provides one natural explanation of this

phenomenon. There are, however, other plausible theories. Sovereign risk is
clearly an important feature of developing—country borrowing, and modern
bargaining—theoretic analyses of sovereign lending suggest a strong relation

between Income and external debt. In the standard models, the relationship is

external borrowing might exceed unity (Romer (1989)]. One testable difference
between the Marshall-Romer model and the one developed here is that our

contracts with lenders.

26See Bulow and Rogoff (1989). or Fernandez and Rosenthal (1988).

countries. Our framework yields a similar prediction for borrowing and
lending spreads.

It Is important to stress that although there are capital market
Imperfections in the model,

Intervention cannot be Pareto

Improving. To achieve Pareto ImprovIng Interventions the public agency would
have to be more efficient than private lenders In overcoming the Informational
problems.

Finally, we note that the present analysis suggests an alternative
explanation for the Feldsteln—Rorioka (1980) puzzle that savings and
Investment tend to be highly correlated across countries.28 In a world of

perfect Information, If a small country's endowment increases without any
corresponding increase in its productive opportunities, It will invest any
increased savings abroad.

In a model where borrowing is subject to

Informational problems, however, a large part of the increase in savings may
be invested domestically.

28Feldstein and Horloka appeal to imperfectly integrated world capital markets
to explain their puzzle. Obstfeld (1986), Stulz (1986) and Tesar (1988) show
how the saving—investment correlation could arise in a frictionless setting if
technology shocks are dominant.
