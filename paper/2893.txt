EMPIRICAL IMPLICATIONS OF ALTERNATIVE MODELS OF FIRM DYNAMICS

ABSTRACT
This paper considers two models for analyzing the dynamics of firm
behavior that allow for heterogeneity among firms, idiosyncratic (or firmspecific) sources of uncertainty, and discrete outcomes (exit and/or entry).

Models with these characteristics are needed for the structural econometric
analysis of several economic phenomena, including the behavior of capital
markets when there are significant failure probabilities, and the analysis of
productivity movements in industries with large amounts of entry and exit.
In addition, these models provide a means of correcting for the self-section
induced by liquidation decisions in empirical studies of firms responses to

alternative policy and environmental changes. It is shown that the two
models have different nonparametric implications -

implications

that depend

only on baaic behavioral assumptions and mild regularity conditions on the
functional forms of interest (one distinction between them corresponds to the
distinction between heterogeneity and an ergodic form of state-dependence; a
form in which the effect of being in a state in a particular period erodes

away as time from that period lapses). The nonparametric implications enable
the construction of testing and selection correction procedures that are easy
to implement (they do not require the computstionslly difficult, and
functional-form specific, estimation algorithms that have been used to
empirically analyze stochastic control models with discrete outcomes in the

past). The paper concludes by checking for the implications of the two
models on an eight-year panel of Wisconsin firms. We find one model to be
consistent with the data for retail trade.

1. Introduction
This paper considers the empirical implications of two models of the
dynamics of firm behavior that allow for heterogeneity among firms,
idiosyncratic (or firm—specific) sources of uncertainty, and discrete

events (exit and/or entry). Our reason for providing an empirical
framework with these features are twofold. First, the nature of
uncertainty, and its relationship to exit and/or entry, is at the heart of

several issues we, as economists, try to analyze. Examples include

the

analysis of capital markets when there are diverse possible outcome paths
and significant failure probabilities; the evolution of the size
distribution of the firms in an industry; and the analysis of industry
supply (or productivity) changes when more efficient firms thrive and grow,

and less efficient contract and, in the extreme case, exit. The second
reason for studying models that allow for uncertainty and exit is that some
allowance has to be made for these phenomena before we can get an accurate
empirical picture of firms' responses to any policy or enviornmental

change. Table 1 illustrates why this is so.
The table provides information on the fraction of firms operating in
'wisconsin in 1978 that were liquidated by 1986 (more details on the

data

will be given in Section 5). Firms are classified as liquidated only if
they physically closed down (changes of ownership are treated separately).
If we were to use these data to build a panel of firms to follow the impact
of some (say) policy change, we would, at least traditionally, start

from

the 1978 cross—section and then construct the panel by eliminating those

firms not in operation over the entire eight—year period. Column 5 shows
that this procedure would lose a third of the firms due to liquidations,
and column 6 shows that this third would account for about a fifth of the

3

jobs in 1978. If we decided to consider only the larger of the 1978 firms,
say those with more than 50 employees (and as column 7 shows, this is a
selection which, by itself, omits over a third of the 1978 jobs),

liquidation would be somewhat less prevalent, but would still cause an

attrition rate of about 15 percent. The last two rows of the table give an
indication of the extent of changes in ownership in this data (this

includes mergers and acquisitions). To the extent that the pre and post
change firms cannot be spliced together, changes in ownership also generate

attrition. It is a relatively more important source of attrition among
larger firms, but even if we confine ourselves to firms with over 50
employees, and assume that all the changes in ownership result in
attrition, changes of ownership would still only account for 40 percent of

total attrition (liquidation accounts for the rest). Note that, when taken
together, liquidations and changes of ownership would cause the attrition
of almost half the firms in the 1978 sample, and of about a quarter of
those with more than 50 employees.

If liquidation decisions were independent of the economic phenomena
typically being investigated, then the omission of the liquidated firms
from the sample might lead to an imprecise, but would not lead to an

inconsistent, description of the phenomena of interest. This is, however,
hardly likely. Firms terminate their activities when they perceive adverse
changes in the distribution of their future profit streams. The phenomena
we typically want to investigate involve the actual profitability (and
productivity) changes resulting from alternative policy and environmental

changes. If there is any relationship at all between perceptions and

realizations

we will, by eliminating those firms which liquidate, omit

precisely those firms for whom the events in question are likely to have

4

had a particularly negative impact. That is, we will tend to omit one tail
of the distribution of responses we set out to study.1

To control for the selection induced by the liquidation process we
need a model that explains why firms operating in similar environments

develop differently — a model with idiosyncratic outcomes that allows for
exit. At least two such models are currently available, and

each

will, no

doubt, prove more useful in approximating the characteristics of different

industries in different time periods. This paper provides a simple set of
procedures which enable the researcher to determine whether either of them
might be relevant for the problem at hand.

The first model considered here is a model with passive Bayesian

learning. Firms are endowed at-birth with an unknown value of a
time—invariant profitability parameter which determines the distribution of

its profits thereafter. Past profit realizations contain information on
the value of the parameter which determines the distribution of possible
future profit streams, and this fact is used by management to form a
probability distribution over future net cash flows (see Jovanovic, 1982).

The second model is a model of active exploration. It assumes that the
firm knows the current value of the parameter that determines the
distribution of its profits, but that the value of that profitability
parameter changes over time in response to the stochastic outco.es of the
firm's own investments, and those of other actors in the same market (see

Ericson and Pakes, 1989). In both models firms act so as to maximize the
expected discounted value of future net cash flow, and in both cases
optimal behavior generates a set of stopping states; i.e. outcomes which,
if

realized,

would induce the firm to exit. loreover, both models are

'corplete' in the sense that if we were willing to append a set of precise

5

functional form assumptions to them, they would produce frameworks rich
enough to take directly to data.

The strategy of appending precise functional form assumptions and then
using their implications to structure the data, is the strategy taken in
all of the recent econometric literature on analyzing stochastic control
models involving discrete outcomes (see liller, 1984; Volpin, 1984; Pikes,

1986; and lust, 1987). Its success depends upon, among other diverse
factors, the extent of prior information on the relevance of alternative

nssunptions. We eschew it here because there is not a great deal of a
information on either which of the models (if any) is appropriate
for different data sets or on the relevance of alternative functional form

assumptions. loreover, just as in all the previous literature on discrete
choice

optimal

stochastic control models, were we to estimate fully

parametric versions of these models we would have to build a different

—ion algorithm for each form estimated. This makes it difficult, if
npossible, to examine the robustness of the major empirical results to
ciLanges in the specification of the model.

The alternative strategy we choose is to look for empirical
implications of the different models that depend only on the models' basic
behavioral assumptions, and some mild regularity conditions on the relevant

functional forms. Precisely because these 'nonparametric' implications
have to be valid for a variety of functional forms, they cannot require

onal form specific estimation and testing algorithms. Consequently,
there are computationally simple ways of checking whether they are

consistent with the data. Therefore, in addition to not being dependent on
particular functional form assumptions, our strategy is easy to implement.
On

the

other hand, the nonparametric procedures provided here do not

6

produce precise values for alternative response parameters. Their goals
are only to provide a low cost, easily interpretable, characterization of

the data which suffices to: 1) distinguish which, if either, of the
alternative models seems relevant for the problem at hand, and 2) act as a
basis for building a procedure for correcting for the selection problem
induced by the liquidation process when one of the models seems
appropriate.

One of the nonparametric differences between the two models
corresponds to the distinction between heterogeneity and state dependence
that has played so large a role in labor econometrics (see leckian, 1981;

Chamberlain, 1984; and Recknan and Singer; 1984). In particular the
passive learning model implies that the stochastic process generating the
size of a firm is characterized by a generalized form of heterogeneity,

while the model with active exploration implies that this stochastic

process is generated by a quite general form of state dependence. Theory
restricts the state dependence in the active learning model to have ergodic
characteristics; i.e. the effect of being in a state in a particular period

erodes away as time from that period lapses. So we develop a test for the
distinction between heterogeneity and ergodic forms of state dependence

based on —niixing conditions. The test is simple, intuitive, and seems to
be able to distinguish between the two models on panel data sets the size
of the ones used here (these follow about 400 observations over eight
years).

In particular, we find both the —mixing test, and an analysis of the
evolution of the size distribution of firms in a cohort, suggest that one
model is consistent with the data for manufacturing, while the other seems

consistent with the data for retail trade. The importance of this result

7

is twofold. First the different models have distinctly different
implications for the manner and the extent to which fin—specific
uncertainties get resolved over time, and hence for the way in which issues

related to these uncertainties ought to be analyzed. Second, the two
models imply different determinants for the probability of liquidation, and
hence different procedures for correcting for liquidation induced attrition
in the analysis of firm's responses to alternative policy and enviromiental
changes.

Section 2 of the paper outlines the passive learning model and then

derives its nonparametric implications. Section 3 does the same for the
model with active exploration. In Section 4 we develop appropriate
estimation and testing procedures. Section 5 begins with a description of
the Visconsin panel, and then examines various subsets of it for the

implications of the two models. Section 6 considers further implications
of the empirical results.

Notation
The distribution of any random variable, say x, conditional on any
event, say z, is denoted Px(.lz), and its density (with respect to the

implied dominating measure) by px(•Iz)• Superscripts denote the vector of
all prior realizations of a process, and subscripts denote a particular

value, so x = (x1, ...,

xt).

Veak vector inequalities are interpreted

element by element, but a strong vector inequality means only that at least

one of the element by element inequalities is strong. Z will be used for
the generic set, and z for a member of that set. Lemmas, theorems,
examples etc. will be numbered in one consecutive ordering within each

section. They are referred to in the following sections with a section

8

prescript.

Section 2. Passive Learnin&.
This section considers models in which each firm is endowed with a
time—invariant characteristic which determines the distribution of its
prof its, but whose value is not known to management at the time

the

firm

begins operation. lodels of industries composed of f iris which learn about
an unknown profitability paraneter have been provided by Jovanovic (1982)

and Lippman and Rumelt (1982). Following Jovanovic (1982), we consider a
Bayesian learning process. At entry the firm believes the value of its
characteristic, say 9, is a random draw fro. some known distribution. Each
period the firm is in operation it obtains a realization from the

distribution of profits conditional on the true value of its 9. These
realizations are used to compute a sequence of posterior distributions.

The posterior available in each period is used as a basis for

decision—making in that period. The decisions of interest are whether to
produce at all and, if so, at what scale. If the firm does decide not to
produce it sells off its assets and exits, never to reappear again. Note
that in this model learning is passive in the sense that information is

obtained as a costless byproduct of operating. One possible analogy is to
the operation of a retail outlet. The outlet learns whether its
neighborhood will support its product, and, if so, at which scale of
operation.

Jovanovic (1982) focuses on establishing the existence of a perfect
foresight equilibrium for a homogeneous product industry composed of firms

which operate in this manner. Ve focus on the implications of the learning
process on the evolution of cohorts of firms, where cohorts are defined by

9

entry dates. In particular we shall look for empirical implications that
rely on the nature of the learning process, and only some mild regularity
conditions on the form of the profit function and the underlying

distributions of interest. Later we compare these implications to data in
an attempt to identify those sectors in which this for. of learning process
seems relevant.

Since management does not know 0 it is assumed to summarize its beliefs
about that parameter in terms of a probability distribution over the

10

possible values of 0. At entry, ianage.ent only knows that 9 is a random
draw from G0(0). The first period produces an

which .anagenent uses,

together with Bayes law, to update its prior [G0(9)] and for. a posterior

which is then used to .ake second period decisions. If the fir. stays in
operation, this updating process continues and decisions are .ade on the
basis of the sequence of updated posteriors.

As the exaaple illustrates, the .odel viii require at least four
primitives; a sequence of random variables, a class of distributions for
those random variables indexed by 0, a prior distribution for 9, and a

payoff function. Before introducing these pri.itives we need a way of
comparing distribution functions; i.e. we need an interpretation for the

statement that one value of 0 is 'better than' another. Ve shall assume
that the family of distributions foraed froa different values of 9 can be

ordered in the likelihood ratio sense defined below. This ensures that
higher realizations of the payoff relevant 77

lead

to Bayesian posteriorS

for 6 that assign larger probability to higher values of 9 (see below, and
ilgroin, 1981).

Assumption 3 provides the primitives of the passive learning •odel and
endows then with some regularity conditions. It generalizes the

assumptions used in our example. In particular the exasple assned that
conditional on a 6E8, the sequence of payoff relevant random variables,
are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) over time.

Then the joint distribution of the sequence {,j}

conditional

on a DEB is

entirely described by the single distribution, P,7(I). Though the i.i.d.
case is easy to deal with, it produces a host of very strong empirical
implications which are a result of the i.i.d. assumption and not of the

logic of the passive learning model per se. Ve, therefore, allow for
dependence in the stochastic process generating

conditional on 9. In

(3.i) we assume only that the marginal distribution of

conditional on 0

the monotone likelihood ratio properties in (3) (in particular the

they be weakly continuous in their arguments). We now move on to consider
the empirical implications of the passive learning model and we shall focus
on implications which require only the assumptions reviewed above

2.2 Empirical Implications of Passive Learning.
Throughout we shall focus on the empirical i.plications of the passive
learning model that are true at each age (that model also has limit
properties as age grows large, but it is hard to use these as a basis for

empirical analysis without further, a priori, information). We begin by
deriving the implications of the passive learning model on the evolution of
the

size distribution of firms.
The theorem that underlies our results on the evolution of the size

is the economist's (far more palatable) version of the
dictum of"survival of the fittest." It states that as age

distribution

Darwinian

increases the 0—distribution of the surviving firms improves (in the
stochastic

dominance sense).

This is a result of self—selection. As time

passes firms with lower 9's are more likely to draw lower 's and

self—liquidate.

Our first empirical implication of the passive learning model is a
direct corollary of theorem 8. Since size is an increasing function of 17,

and

is stochastically increasing in 9, the fact that the 9 distribution

of the surviving firms is stochastically increasing over time implies that
the size distribution of surviving firms ought to be stochastically
increasing in time.

are many ways of employing Corollary 9 to identify industries

Implications of the passive learning model that specify a sonotonic
relationship between two or more observables are particularly useful since
they can be checked against data without imposing undue functional form

restrictions. Though the literature on the passive learning model seems to
have missed Corollary 9, it has associated at least three other monotonic

relationships with passive learning. These are that:
i) the hazard rate is nonincreasing in current size; i.e., that

Pr{Xt=OIyt_il, S_1=si} is nonincreasing in
ii) the hazard rate is nondecreasing in age (usually, but not always,
conditional on size);

iii) and that the variance in growth rates (again usually conditional
on size) is nonincreasing in age
(these implications are discussed in Jovanovic, 1982; Evans, 1987a and
1987b; and Dunne, Roberts and Samuelson, 1987).

The next example shows that of these three only the first survives our
search for nonparametric implications of the passive learning model (the

21

example assumes, as did Jovanovic, 1982, that the distribution of {v)

conditional

on 0 is i.i.d.). It is true, however, that the first

implication, that is that hazard rates are nonincreasing in size at a given
age, both persists and is consistent with the data from every empirical
study we are aware of [Churchill, 1955; Vedervang, 1965; Evans 1987s and

1987b; Dunne, koberts, and Sanuelson, 1987]. lowever, most other models
that allow for mortality, including Ericson and Pales's (1989) model of

active exploration, also imply mortality rates that decrease in size for a

given age. Therefore, this property fails to distinguish among the
alternative models, and we do not pay further attention to it in this
paper.

As to the other implications, the fact that the passive learning model
does not imply that either hazard rates, or the variance in growth rates,

decline in age (at least not without further ad hoc assumptions) is

somewhat disconcerting. Decreasing hazards and decreasing variances in
growth rates have both been associated with the passive learning model in
the past, and, in addition, have been shown to be fairly robust features of

the data. On the other hand, the intuition underlying our counterexample
is clear enough. For many functional forms it will tale time to accumulate
the information necessary to ensure that exit is optimal, and this fact
generates an initial increasing portion to the hazard function (actually
the example generalizes this intuition and generates a hazard function

which oscillates over age). As to differences in the variance in growth
rates over age, these will depend upon, among other factors, the relative

variances of ,

conditional

on 0 for different values of 0. If 6—values

which are more likely to induce exit are associated with low variances, the

22

observed variance in growth rates may well increase over age.

However, if t <

Similar pictures could be drawn for the variance in growth rates.

This

[

example illustrates that if we are interested in other

nonparametric implications of the passive learning model we should look
beyond the implications of passive learning on the pattern of either the

hazard or the variance in growth rates. It is, therefore, fortunate that
the passive learning model has some very distinctive implications on the
underlying structure of the conditional probabilities generating growth and
mortality.

25

These implications stem primarily from the fact that 0 is

time—invariant. As a result, early realizations of

contain information

about the parameter that determines the distribution of its future values;

and this will be true no matter the time that elapses in the interim. Put
differently, the dependence in the joint distribution of

erode away as t grows large. This is seen most clearly in the special case
where, conditional on 0, the {,j}

which is independent of t and k. This strong invariance property is
destroyed when we allow 0 to index the more general family of stochastic

processes permitted in (3). In the general case we have, for any zfN,

P7(zlVk =

can depend upon t and k, so can P (zI7 =

Vt

fiowever, the passive learning model does imply that the dependence in this

latter distribution has two sources, one of which will

erode away as t

grows large. That is, though the dependence in the process generating
conditional on 0 (in the integrand) may erode away with t (it will if the
process generating

is ergodic), the dependence that results from the

effect of the realization of

on the posterior for 0 will not.

This argument can be formalized and then used to produce a test for

26

the passive learning model based on differences between the marginal
distribution of St =

S(t),

and the distribution of S conditional on S1.

Actually we can do better than this and produce tests based on a comparison
to the distribution

of the distribution of S conditional on

and Si, for any kO. With a positive k

of S conditional on S_1,...

this test is likely to be more powerful against alternatives in which the
value of the paraLeter determining the firm's distribution of profits
evolves in a larkovian fashion over tile (and one such alternative is the
model of active exploration considered in the next section).

Our test is a direct implication of the following theorem. The
theorem states that if we choose

group of years for which there is

information on past realizations of , and derive the family of posterior
distributions for 0 conditional on possible ,—realizations in those years,
then members of the family with higher past n—realizations will
stochastically dominate those with lower n—realizations.

That is, expected future size conditional on I past sizes and survival

will be strictly increasing in the initial size. This is because the
parameter which determines the conditional distribution of the payoff

relevant r is time—invariant. In models in which these conditional
distributions depend on a paraieter which evolves over time in response to,
say, the outcomes of a firm's exploratory investment, corollary (13) will

not necessarily be true. Ve turn to these types of models now.

Section 3. Active Exploration
This section considers the empirical implications of a model
(originally developed by Ericson and Pakes, 1989), in which firms can

28

invest to improve the value of a parameter, say w, which deter.ines the

distribution of its profits. In the model with active exploration (in
contrast to in the passive learning •odel) management is assumed to know

its current value of , (and hence the actual profit distribution it faces),
and makes current production decision based on it. On the other hind a,
itself evolves over time in response to the outcomes of the firm's own

investment process, and the investments of other firms operating in related

markets. These outcomes are stochastic; in the active exploration model
the firm invests to explore and develop alternative market niches which
may, or may not, prove profitable.
In this model the distribution of futures states is determined

entirely by the current state and the optimal investment policy. It is,
therefore, independent of the age of the firm per se. Startup is treated
as the appearance of an idea which, given current market conditions,
-

-°ars

worth exploring. Formally it is an initial location on the &—axis.
idea requires substantial successful development before it can

noticeable profits, the initial & is associated with a
distribution of profits which is degenerate (or nearly so) at zero.

Successful investment will enable the idea to be embodied in a more

profitable marketable good or service. 3nsuccessful exploration may well
convince the entrepeneur that the whole idea is not worth pursuing and lead
to liquidation.

Ericson and Pakes begin with a simple model in which the distribution
of the firm's profits depends only on the difference between the firm's own
level of development and an exogenous aggregate index of the state of the

industry. They then generalize to cases in which the firm's profit
distribution also depends explicitly on the levels of developueTit of all

29

the encumbents in, and the potential entrants to, the industry. Here we
suffice with a brief description of the simpler model, as this special case
of the more general framework is sufficient to contrast its empirical

implications to those of the passive learning model just described. Again
we consider only those empirical implications that are nonparaaetric in the
sense that they require only mild regularity conditions on the relevant
functional forms.

a unique solution), and both p(OIx) and p(_1Ix) are strictly positive for
all x less than any finite upper bound (these are technical conditions
whose roles are explained in more detail below).

iii) r(.) and S(.) are increasing functions of ,, and c(.) is
non—increasing function of w, into Dc. r(.) provides the profits, and S(.)

s of two Mackay processes. But a process which is a sum of Mackay

36

not Iarkov.

The second point to note concerns the mortality of firms. Assumption

Since p0 0 = 1, this implies that all

states but 0 are 'transient'. That is, no matter its initial ai,

a firm

will, with probability one, reach zero in finite time and stay there.
Firms, like people, eventually die.

Since the passive learning model implies that fins can survive
forever there is a sense in which this latter result differentiates the
model with active exploration from the passive learning model. However, i
order to make empirical use of this distinction we would require a very

long time series of data. On the other hand, the passive learning model
did have the additional implication that the size distribution of survivir
firms ought to be stochastically increasing in any finite range of ages

(corollary 2.9). For comparison, we now consider the properties of the
sequence of survivor distributions generated by the model with active
exploration.

Let

{lRL; Eq=1}

be an L—1 dimensional simplex, so that any qfQK can be regarded as a

37

density on fl. Note that a potential entrant with an w=O would not enter,

it can

so that the initial distribution of the & in a cohort is a
be shown (see Ericson and Pakes, 1989) that no tatter the initial
the w and S distributions of the survivors in period t, say

P(.jt,p°) and Ps(.lt, p0)

each converge (point wise), as t grows large, to a unique invariant

distribution, say

and

(these distributions are invariant to both p0 and to the passage of time).
One can actually go one step further than this and show that, given some
additional regularity conditions on the location of p0 and on the
transition probabilities, there will be a finite t ,

P5(.t+1, 0)

(4)

such that for any p

P5(•tt,p°)

I

provided

t>t .

That is, not only does the size—distribution of surviving
*

firms

converge to an invariant distribution, but after some t the

convergence will be 'monotone' and the size distribution of surviving firms
will stochastically increase from period to period (just as in the passive
learning model).

Still, however, the empirical implications of the active learning
model on the evolution of the size—distributions of surviving firms are

weaker than those of the passive learning model. In particular the active

38

learning model does not predict that the size distribution will be

stochastically increasing at each age. On the other hand, the active
learning model does not bar this event from occurring, and

it

can

predict

that the size distribution will be stochastically increasing at later ages.
There is, however, at least one set of observable implications which

differentiate between the two models more sharply. tecall that in the
passive learning model the parameter that determines the distribution of

profits is tine invariant. This induces a dependence between the initial
size of a firm and the size at any future date. Indeed as equation (2.12)
shows, the passive learning model implies the stronger result that the
conditional distribution of size at t, conditional on the immediate past
sizes and the initial size, will always be strictly increasing in the

initial size. In the active learning model the parameter determining the
firm's profitability distribution, i.e. &, evolves over time. Later year

size realizations are governed by a different value ofi than those from
earlier years and, as time passes, the dependence between the later and

earlier values of , and therefore of size, dies out. This is also true
for the conditional distribution of S; i.e. the distribution of St
conditional on immediate past values of S should gradually become
on

independent of initial year sizes. loreover, since the dependence of
its history is only through the value of

we might expect that if we

condition on immediate past sizes the dependence on initial size will die

out relatively quickly. Indeed, in the extreme case where S =
that sales is a deterministic function of ''

the

(&),

so

conditional distribution

of St depends only on Sf1. In this case a three year panel is enough to
differentiate the active from the passive learning model.
Vhen there is noise in the relationship between

and size we must

39

base our distinction between the active and the passive learning model on
more detailed properties of the stochastic process generating size

conditional on survival. Let

be that process (it is described

formally in Appendix 2). Then, the active learning model implies that as r

grows large the distribution of (S7,

becomes, roughly

spe:ing, independent of realizations of (St,.. .,S). lore precisely, we
have lemma 6 and its implications (explained i.mediately after presentation
of the lemma).

(2)

is strictly increasing in s1. Again the passive learning model says it
must be. But here there is a sharper contrast with the implications of the
active exploration model. The model with active exploration implies that,

for t large enough, the regression function in (2) cannot depend on s. To
check whether (1) seems consistent with the data, we will simply plot and

compare the size distribution at different ages. It is more difficult to
present a pictoral representation 0f the regression function in (2). Our
analysis of its properties must, therefore, be somewhat more formal.

This section develops an intuitive nonparaetnic estimator for (2),

and then considers tests of whether or not it is increasing in s. Indeed,
since both models imply that the regression junction is nondecreasing in

s1, we employ a two—part testing sequence. Ve first test whether (2) is

42

weakly increasing in s1. If this were not the case we would doubt whether
either of our models provided an adequate approximation to the process

generating the data being analyzed. If, on the other hand, the hypothesis
of weak monotonicity is acceptable, we love on to test the null of whether

the regression function does not depend on s against the alternative of it
being strictly increasing in that variable. Acceptance of both null
hypotheses is interpreted as support for the active exploration model,

while acceptance of only the first is interpreted as support for passive
learning.

To obtain our estimator of the regression function we define J

positive numbers, say {j}1' and use them to break

In the empirical analysis we treat all values of S that fall into the

appropriate rate). For our purposes, then, a {S_i, S_2,...,St,Si}

values of cl((St_1). Each of these values is a k+1 diiensional cell, and we

denote the set 0f such cells by {c;p=1,... ,J1}. Our testing procedure
is based on estimating the mean and the variance of the regression function
in (2) in the intervals defined by these cells.

Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations' (bURR's) records for
unemployment insurance (UI) coverage. The records for the years between
1978 and 1986 (inclusive) were linked together by UI account number by

and attrition due to mergers (and other

status). A major advantage of this type of data is that

it can distinguish between these two sources of 'exit'.

Tables 2 and 3 provide information on the evolution of the size
distribution of the surviving firms from the 1979 birth cohort in retail
and in manufacturing, respectively (recall, from Table 1, that these two

sectors account for 80 percent of the employment in our sample). The row
labelled 'count' gives the number of firms active in the column age. The
row labelled transferring out provides the number of firms which were
active in the column year but transferred out (due to a change in legal
status)

before 1986. This

source of attrition accounts for about 8Z of the

49

1979 cohort in retail trade, and about 4% in manufacturing. This should be
compared to the extent of liquidation (the figures given in the row

labelled mortality rates). Over 60% of the 1979 birth cohort in retail
liquidated before 1986, and the analogous figure in manufacturing was over

50%. Since liquidation was quantitatively so much sore important a source
of attrition in these data, we simply omitted those fins who subsequently
changed ownership from the analysis. (Kowever, almost identical empirical
results are obtained if we include the fins in the analysis until the year
before they transfer out.)

The passive learning model implies that the proportion of surviving
firms with size greater than any I, or the numbers in each row of the body
of the tables, should increase with age (i.e., as we move from left to

right on the table). Ye have 'squared off' the adjacent transitions which
do not satisfy this condition. On the whole, the consistency of the data

with the hypothesis is quite striking —

particularly

in retail. Of the

seventy—seven possible adjacent transitions, only six are decreasing, and

none of them indicate a fall of more than 1.0%. In manufacturing there are
nine transitions which decrease; two fall by more than i.5%, and two more

by .6%. Given the possibilities for reporting and recording errors in this
type of data (see Neuendorf and Shaffer, 1987), if the null were true, we

would not find these results to be 'surprising'. That is, to us these
results are quite consistent with the implications of passive learning —

indeed amazingly so for retail trade. Note also that, in both sectors, the
means are strictly increasing in age.

A more detailed look at these two tables uncovers some revealing
contrasts between the evolution of the size distributiod in the two

sectors. The size distribution in the initial year is not much different

50

between the two sectors; indeed if anything the initial size distribution
is slightly 'larger' in retail trade (retail has the larger initial year
mean, 5.4 vs. 4.9, and a higher percentage of the firms in the largest size

classes). However, by age eight this ordering has turned around. That is,
by age eight the size distribution for manufacturing is stochastically
larger (even in the strict sense) than that in retail (the means are 13.3
vs 8.8, and manufacturing has over twice the fraction of firms with 50 or

more employees). The size distribution is stochastically increasing in age
in both sectors, but it is increasing at a much more rapid rate in
manufacturing.
loreover, the age eight distribution in retail is quite close to the
cross—sectional distribution of all retail firms active in 1978 (or 1986,

see the last two columns of the table). Both have about 3 of their firms
with more than 50 employees (though the cross—sectional distribution still

has the larger mean, 14 vs. 9). In contrast, the age eight distribution in
manufacturing is much smaller than the 1978 cross—sectional distribution in

that sector. In manufacturing the cross—sectional distribution has more
than three times the fraction of firms with more than 50 employees (19.6
vs.

6.5), and a mean which is

almost six times that from the age eight

distribution (73.8 vs. 13.3). Thus, if we were to think of the
cross—sectional distribution as an approximation to the limit distribution
(even though formally it is not), then we might conclude that by age eight
the retail cohort had almost reached it, but the manufacturing cohort was

still nowhere near its limit distribution. Indeed, if we also assumed that
eight years was enough time to form a fairly precise posterior about a tine
invariant profitability paramenter, then we would conclude that the data
from retail was supportive of the passive learning model, but the data from

51

manufacturing

was not.

A more formal check of the consistency of the data with the two models

can be derived from an analysis of the regression for size at age eight on

size in the immediate preceding periods, and size at age one. Both .odels
imply that this function will be weakly increasing in initial size, but the

passe learning model implies that it be strictly increasing in that
variable, and the active learning .odel isplies that it will not.
Tables 4 and 5 provide some evidence on the relevant hypothesis.

Because there were less than half the number of entering firms annually in
manufacturing, we aggregated the 1979 and 1980 Lanufacturing cohorts and
examined the regression for expected sales at age seven of the aggregated

cohort. The cell size cutoffs were set at the beginning of the analysis
and not changed thereafter. For the weak sionotonicity, and the zero

conditional on monotonicity, restrictions, we have presented two sets of
'p—values' for each observed value of the test statistic. The first column
provides the simulated estimates of the true p—values as explained in
Section 4 (the estimated standard errors of these estimates appear in

parentheses below their values). The second column provides the p—values
that would be obtained if the components of the estimator of the vector of
constraints being tested had mutually independent distributions under the

null. In this case the weights required for the calculation of the limit
distribution (see equation 4.7) have an analytic form (see appendix 3), so

there is no need for simulation. Though the independence assumption is
wrong in our (and probably in most) cases, it does provide an easily
calculable approximation to the non—analytic true p-value which might be of
use in (at least) the preliminary stages of analysis if the approximation
produced numbers that were sufficiently close to those we are after.

52

Comparing columns (1) and (2) in the next four tables it is clear that in
the cases where the true p—values were low (say less than .10), so that
there was some chance of rejecting the null, the approxilation did produce
a value within .05 of the value we were after.
iote first that none of the tests reject weak ionotonicity at

traditional levels of significance. So both the retail and the
manufacturing data are consistent with the hypothesis that the regression

function is nondecreasing in i' just as both our aodels predict. There
the similarity in the test results on the two data sets ends. In retail it
is clear that if we condition on one lagged value of S, that is on

realizations of S7, and then vary s1, firms with larger s have larger
average sales at age 8. There is really no doubt about this point as the
p—value of the test statistic is essentially zero, so we would reiect the

null at any traditional significance level. The same is true if we
condition on s7 and

or on s7, s6 and s5; or even on s7, S6, 65 and s4;

and then vary s. In all these cases realizations of S1 have an
independent effect on the expectation of sales at age eight. This
dependence only starts to become insignificant at five percent significance

levels when we condition on five past sales realizations. Rowever, this
might well be a result of the possibility that, with our limited amount of
data, a fifth order nonparanietric autoregression would provide an adequate

approximation to the expectation for size generated from any stochastic
process —

(—niixing

or not; we come back to this point below).8

The results for the test of zero conditional on weak sonotonicity are

strikingly different in manufacturing. Table 5 indicates that, in
manufacturing, once we condition on a single lagged value of S, i.e. a

realization of S6, an' differences in s do not effect the expected size at

53

age

seven. This time there is little doubt about accenting the null as the

p—value is well above .5. loreover, the same results obtain if we
condition instead on

and s; or on 6'

and 54; or 6'

84 and 83.

Tables 6 and 7 push the nonparametric analysis one step further and
ask what order of Iarkov process provides an adequate nonparametric fit to

the (npectation from the) stochastic process generating size conditional
on survival in retail and in manufacturing. The tests in these tables
follow a pattern analogous to that in Tables 4 and 5. That is, we first
test whether first year size, size in the first two years, .

.. , have a

nondecreasing effect conditional on the variables left in the regression
function; and then test whether we can accept a zero effect conditional on

any of the existing effects being nondecreasing. Again the results are
quite clear. Ye never reject weak monotonicity. In retail we need a fifth
order nonpararnetric Iarkov process to adequately approximate the data.

Recall that this is precisely the same 'k' we needed before we could accept
the null that the conditional regression function for size, conditional on
'5t—k' did not depend on

In contrast, in manufacturing a third

order nonparametric Iarkov process seems to provide an adequate fit to the

data. That is, in manufacturing there is a distinction between the orders
needed for the —inixing and the Iarkov tests (compare tables 7 and 5).

Table 5 says that conditional on realizations of S6 realizations of S1 do

not affect the regression function. Table 7 says that realizations ofS5,
and of S4, do. The active exploration model explains this difference by
allowing the parameter that determines the size distribution to evolve over
tine in a 'smooth' fashion, so that its value in year 5 will tend to be
closer to its value in year 7, and therefore have a more distinct effect on

54

the regression function for 57, than its value in year 1 wjll.

Section 6. Further Imolications of the Emuirical Lesults.
Our empirical results can be suamarized quite succinctly. The
nonparametric implications of the active exploration model are consistent
with the data in manufacturing, while the monparaaetric iaplications of the

passive learning model definitely are not. On the other hand, the
nonparametric implications of the passive learning model seem consistent
with the data in retail trade, while those from the active learning model

do not. These distinctions ought to effect the typeof models we use to
analyze phenomena that depend upon firm—specific uncertainties and
differences in output paths among firms within an industry; phenomena such
as the behavoir of capital markets when there are significant failure
probabilities, or supply responses to environmental and policy changes that
can induce exit.

The nonparametric results ought also to effect how we account for
liquidation induced attrition in the analysis of longitudinal firm—level
data. As an example of the importance of such corrections, consider the

following excerpt from Davis, Galiman, and Rutchins, "Productivity in

American Vhaling: The New Bedford Fleet in the Nineteenth Century."

"The age of the vessel (entered as age and age squared) also
captures the effects of more than a single set of factors.
Elements of wear and tear that influenced productivity, a
technical characteristic that one might hope to capture in the
age variable, are confounded with the consequence of qualitative
differences among survivors; ineffective vessels were transferred

55

by their owners to other activities, were condemned at an early
age, or were destroyed in service."
Davis, Gallian and lutchins (1987) p.26.

The quotation illustrates how even one of the most traditional of

varibles (age), in one of the most traditional of settings (productivity
analysis), can have its "structural" effects (as a measure of the likely
extent of physical deterioration) confounded by the self—selection process
induced by the endogeneity of the liquidation decision (it also

demonstrates a remarkable understanding of the environment generating the

data). Davis, Galiman and Rutchins (1987) do indeed find a significant
Dositive first order effect of age on vessel productivity.
To see how the nonparametric implications used to test for the

relevance of alternative models can also be used to separate out the
structural production function coefficients in examples such as this one,
assume that output is a parametric function of inputs, say f(xt, fi),

and an

additive disturbance,-say , whose value is not known when input decisions

are made. Then the expectation of output

Twa points should be noted here. First we are ignoring the effect (on
both r(.) and S(.)) of random variables which have the same value for
different individuals at the same point in time, but differ in value over
time (this would have occurred in our example ii prices had varied over
tine). At the cost of complicating the notation we could add a price
process to our problem without changing any of our major results (though
some modifications would have to be made to the procedure that matches the

interpretation of r(.) and S(.) as mappings fro. realizations of , would
were realized before input
only be appropriate for our example if
decisions were made (larschak and Andrews, 1944). In this case both output
and the size measure can be either
and inputs can be determined from

output produced or inputs purchased. The extreme alternative is to assume
there is no within—period adjustment to 17 (Zeliner, Imenta, and Dreze,
1966), in which case inputs are chosen to maximize 04

E(t)

where Et provides expectations conditional on current information

(and will be defined more precisely below). In this case r(.) and S(.)
to Etrt+i, and input demand
would be interpreted as mappings from Et

in period t1 respectively. There are, of course, ineriiediate cases where
within period adjustment is either partial, or more costly (the appropriate
characterization is likely to depend upon the characteristics of the
industry being studied). Ye shall come back to some of the alternatives
below, but for now suffice it to note that the results we focus attention
on do not depend on the timing of the input decision.

The following counterexample shows that this would not be the case if we
were to assume only a weaker first order stochastic dominance ordering.
Let 0 =

Vt(nt) is the value of continuing in operation at t given that nt=nt (a
more precise definition of this function is given below), then what we need

be nondecreasing in nt. Of course, the actual

behavior of "exit values" is an empirical question. If the process
generating the exit we are modelling is indeed a liquidation process, and
not a process generated by changes of ownership and continued operation of
the firm in a different guise, the assumptions we require ought not to be
problematic.

Just as in our description of the passive leaning model we will assume
the
here, for expositional simplicity, that input choices are made
realization of r, that liquidation values are a constant I, and that there
is no time—specific, firm—invariant process. Further, the formulation
presented here assumes that the conditional distribution of r does not
depend on w, an assunption not required for our results.

Ye are grateful to them for granting us access to their data, and for
graciously answering our subsequent queries, lore detail on the data can
be found in the appendix of Neuendorf and Shaffer (1987). Though
multiestablishment firms have a choice as to whether to report as a single,
or as multiple units, the establishments of multiestablishment firms that
reported separately have been merged into single observations. This should
therefore be thought of as firm—level data.

Ye have been motivating our two—part testing sequence as a way of
providing additional information on the relevance of alternative models.
Inequality tests were originally motivated as providing more powerful ways
of testing a given null. Table 4 also illustrates this point. Take, for
example, the case where k=2. The p—value in column 2 for acceptance of the
null that realizations of S do not matter under the maintained hypothesis
6

that any effect of S is non—decreasing, is zero; but the p—value for the
test that S does not matter under the unconstrained maintained hypothesis
(the unconditional zero columns) is a traditionally acceptable .11.

Footnote 2 discussed the possibility that input decisions are either
wholly, or partially, made before the realization of ,, and concluded by
asserting that the various alternatives would not affect the results we
focus on. Table 7 insures this is so for the very special, but important,
case which Jovanovic's (1982) original article was based on. His
assumptions were a special case of the following ones; the process
generating {n} conditional on 0 was i.i.d., the posterior for U had

sufficient statistics (xt, t) with x =

ft(xt_i,

i)

for

and

some

that no input could be adjusted after any information about

was

available. In this case, if input quantities were our size measure, size
in period t is determined by (xti,t) and for a given t, there is a 1:1
correspondence between

and x_2. So size is a first order Iarkov

process. This conclusion would be destroyed if so'e, say costly,
adjustments could be made after i were realized, or if there were any
dependence in the process generating {'} conditional on 0. However, if
Jovanovic's restrictions were true, the passive learning model would
satisfy the constraint that the regression for St conditional on S_1,
St_k does not depend on S1 provided k

1; i.e., it would satisfy the

constraint used to test for the active learning model. On the other hand
Table 7 makes it clear that the stochastic process generatin; size is not
first order Iarkov, so the special case discussed by Jovanovic (1982) is
not relevant.

respectively. Lemmas, equations, etc. are numbered in a separate
consecutive orderring within each appendix.

ApDendix I. Proofs of Results Vsed in Section 2.

Part 1. Theorem 2.7 (existence and lontonicity of the value function)
At each t there exists a unique Vt(.):Nt

which provides the value

of continuing in operation assuming optimal behavior in each future period.
is bounded, satisfies (6), and is nondecreasing fl

4, then

flt; i.e.,

if 4

V(4) > V(4) [for ntNt, and all t].

The proof proceeds as follows. First it considers the finite horizon
problem in which a firm which remains active until_period T must liquidate

for 4 dollars at T+l. For this problem the value of continuing in
operation from period t (as a function of past ,7—realizations) will be

denoted by V(.): Nt -.

{o,i).

R,, and the resulting stopping function by XT(.): Nt

V(.) can be determined by backward recursion from the terminal

year and a stopping policy which dictates liquidation if and

only

if the

value of continuing in operation is less than I. The implied stopping
function, x(nt), is one if and only if fltfjT

{t: 4(4)

> i,

> 4,... ,V(n) > I). As T increases V(.) converges (pointwise)
to a limit function, V(.). This limit function is bounded, monotonic in
and satisfies the Bellman condition, i.e. equation 2.6, in the text.

The proof concludes by showing that V(.), and the associated limit

are indeed the solution to the infinite horizon

Appendix 3. The Test Statistics1
Ve begin by developing a test for the null hypothesis that

The reader interested in more detail on the testing procedures used in
this section should consult Barlow et. al. (1972), or the more recent
econometric literature on testing subject to inequality constraints
which begins with the work of Gourieroux, Folly, and lonfort (1982).

Golberger's (1987) exposition is particularly clear.

r is an 'unconstrained' estimator of r obtained from substituting sample

for population means. rk is a 'constrained' estimator, an estimator forced
to satisfy the inequality constraint of the null. Subject to that
constraint, it is obtained by minimizing a quadratic form in (r—r), where

the weighting matrix, R[Vk]_lR, is chosen to be the estimated
variance—covariance of r under the hypothesis that

=

Since the quadratic form in (A2b) is nonnegative and equal to zero if

Unfortunately, the orthant probabilities, that is the values of

Var[T1(a)J =

substituting the simulated for the actual values of V in this variance
