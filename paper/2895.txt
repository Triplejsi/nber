THE EFFECT OF TAKEOVERS ON THE EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES
OF CENTRAL-OFFICE AND OTHER PERSONNEL

ABSTRACT

This paper presents evidence based on establishment-level Census
Bureau data concerning the effects of ownership change on the employment
and wages of both central—office workers and manufacturing plant employees.
We find that central offices that changed owners between 1977 and 1982
had substantially lower -- about 16% lower -- employment growth during
(There was,
that period than central offices not changing owners.
however, no significant difference in the growth of R&D employment.) In
owners
contrast, employment growth in production establishments changing
was only 5% lower than it was in production establishments not changing
owners.
(The relative employment decline in production establishments
changing owners occurred in the 2 or 3 years before the takeover; after
the takeover, employment recovered a bit, but not enough to offset the
previous decline.) This implies that the ratio of central-office to
about 7.2
plant employees declines about 11% in firms changing owners:
administrators per 1000 plant employees are eliminated. These findings
are consistent with the view that reduction of administrative overhead is
an important motive for changes in ownership. Failure to account for
reductions in central—office employment results in a substantial (about
40%) underestimate of the productivity gains associated with ownership
We also provide evidence concerning the relationship between

During the 1980s there has been a rapid increase in the rate of
business ownership change in the United States.
flies

The value of the

cornpa-

involved in such transactions increased almost sixfold between 1980

and 1986.

The proliferation of takeovers has stimulated growing interest

(and in some cases concern) among policymakers, scholars,

and the public

about the causes and effects of ownership change, particularly about its
effects on efficiency (hence 'competitiveness).
One view of the process of ownership change is that takeovers
(actual or threatened) are often necessary to force or allow significant

changes in management practices, particularly substantial curtailment in
(some of) the firm's activities.

Shleifer and Vishny (1988, p.11), for

example, argue that
hostile takeovers affect industries in decline or sharp change where
managers fail to shrink operations rapidly enough or to make other
adjustments. In maintaining full-scale operations, managers may be
guarding the domain of their control or trying to protect employees
from dismissal or wage cuts.
The group of employees that top executives may try
their immediate subordinates:

hardest to protect

are

managers and administrators employed at

corporate or divisional headquarters. If so, a change in ownership would
have a much greater impact on these employees than it would have on those
lower down in the corporate hierarchy.
Prominent corporate "raiders" claim that this is indeed the case.
Henry Kravis (1989, p. 71) makes the following statements concerning
leveraged buyouts:
People who produce things will stay. We look at the people who
report to people who report to people. We'll often cut fat at the
corporate level. There'd be much less of this... if chief executives
felt the pressure from their directors to do the cutting that they
only do when they're threatened by takeover.

In a

similar vein, Carl Icahn (1989) asserts that we have
created a corporate welfare state. . . companies are burdened by
who not only don't produce, hut are often
layers of vice presidents
counterproductive... .1 and other 'raiders" usually eliminate the
people who are most responsible for the mess —- the "Top Brass"..
In 1986, 1 took control of T.W.A. .. .and managed to eliminate more
than $300 million a year in waste and bureaucracy.
.

This kind of "restructuring" can occur in the absence of a major
shock to the organization, such as a takeover or bankruptcy.

General

Electric and Monsanto provide two recent examples of this:
[The chief executive of General Electric turned] GE from a textbook
case of a massive, bureaucratically managed conglomerate into a new
model of decentralised, liberated management... .He has dispensed
with layers of headquarters staff, cutting it from 1700 to 1000 by
removing the administrators that acted as filters between each
business unit and the bose's office.

Monsanto's main orgamiaational change in its factories has been to
do away with most of its foreman, supervisors, and quality inapec
tors and instead to invite plant workers to oversee themselves...
Another useful change has been to give workers contact with their
customers, so that they know where the product goes and wy...

based on Census Bureau surveys or censuses of both types of estabiisnments.

For each type of establishment, we estimate differences between

establishments changing and not changing owners in the growth of
employment and wages, so we can contrast the effects of takeovers on
auxiliary- and production-establishment employees. We can also identify
the effects on a small but important subset of personnel -- employees
-- and distinguish between the
engaged in research and development (R&D)
effects on production and nonproduction workers in productson
establishments.
There is a small previous literature on the labor impact of ownership change, but no previous studies have examined administrative employment separately.

In Section II we briefly review the existing evidence

In Section III we describe the nature of our data and provide some
background and historical information about auxiliary-establishment
employment and wages.

econometric estimates.

relative to that of "nonchangers." But the decline occurs largely if not
entirely before the change in ownership; after the change, there is a
relatiwe increase in labor input, although too small an increase to
completely offset the previous decline.
Our previous paper did not contain any evidence about the behavior
of wages or compensation (wages plus supplements) in connection with
ownership change, nor did it distinguish between production and
nonproduction employees. Moreover, the analysis was based only on data
for manufacturing (production)

establishments; central administrative

offices, which in 1982 accounted for 10.0 percent of manufacturing
payrolls, were not included.

Total labor input was defined as "production-worker—equivalent
manhours," i.e. as production-worker manhours times the ratio of

Almost all of these differences were due to differences in employment growth, rather than differences in growth of average annual
hours of work.

administrative

offices and contrast them with the corresponding

effects in production establishments. This comparison is of interest in
its own right, and it also enables us to assess and eliminate the bias to
which our earlier productivity estimates were subject. We also
re-examine the labor impact of ownership change in production establishments in greater detail
The second study that provides evidence on the labor impact of
changes in ownership is Kaplan's (1988) analysis of a sample of 33 large
(over $50 million) management buyouts of public companies completed
between 1980 and 1986.

Kaplan compared the number of employees at the

end of the first full post-buyout year in which employment numbers were
before the buyout.5 He
reported with the number of employees in the year
found that the median employment change for all 33 firms was 00%, but
the median

employment change was -15.3%, i.e. employ-

ment growth among buyout firms was 15.3 percentage points below growth

The third study of ownership change, by Brown and Medoff (1988), is
the only one whose principal focus

is on its effects on labor, and is the

ooiy one to provide estimates of wage effects. These authors analyzed
quarterly employment and payroll data contained in unemployment insurance
records kept by the Michigan Employment Security Commission.

As they

acknowledge, an important disadvantage of this data set is that it covers
only a single state.

Consequently, the data do noi reflect what is

in othar locations of multistate companies, and few large
acquisitions are recorded in their data. Brown and Medoff distinguished
happening

three

kinds of ownership change:

(1)

"simple sales":

firm A changes

ownership without being integrated with any other firm; (2) "assets-only
sale":

firm A purchases the assets of firm B without absorbing its

workforce; and (3) "merger":

firm A purchases firm B and (at least

initially) absorbs (most of) firm B's workers, or firm A and firm B
combine to form firm C, with (at least initially) firm C including (most
of) the workers of firms A and B.

Their estimates of the employment and

wage changes associated with each type of transaction are as follows:
employment

Farber (1988) observed that the fact that transactions were classified on
the basis of employment changes makes it difficult to interpret the
employment effects, and the authors themselves acknowledge that the
estimates of these effects are sensitive to specification details; the
wage effects were less ambiguous. Because only about 1/3 of these

They observe that in the case of mergers, the wage

decline may partly be due to the departure of the relatively highly-paid
head of the acquired firm.
Auerbach (1988, p. 2) suggested that perhaps the most important
conclusion that can be drawn from the Brown and Medoff study is that the

on overall employment and wage rates is small, it may have a sizeable

Data and descriptive statistics
The empirical analysis described in this paper is based on three

distinct data sets, each based on a different Census Bureau census or
survey of establishments or firms.

The first data set is based on

the 1977 and
"Auxiliary Establishment Reports" collected in the course of

1982 Economic Censuses.

Researchers have not, to our knowledge, previ-

ously analyzed these data at the micro level.

The Census Bureau defines

auxiliary establishments as those
whose employees are primarily engaged in general and tusiness

that were ever observed were observed in only one year, presumably
due to closing and opening of establishments. Since 1982 was a very

non-matches of the code may be due to coding errors, and certain ownership changes may not result in changes in the code.

Measurement error

contained in our indicator of ownership change is likely to bias towards
zero the estimated differences in behavior between establishments changing and not changing owners.

Unfortunately, the data don't permit us to

classify ownership changes into different "types", e.g. hostile versus
friendly takeovers.
The data set described above enables us to contrast the employment
and wage behavior of auxiliary establishments changing owners with that

of auxiliary establishments not changing owners.

We also wish to con-

trast the former with the behavior of production establishments changing
owners.

To accomplish this we utilize a second data set, the Longitudi-

nal Establishment Data (LED).

This data set, based on the Annual Surveys

and Censuses of Manufactures, contains annual data for the years 1972-81
on the output and inputs of almost 20,000 manufacturing (production)
establishments.

It was the basis for our previous (1987) study of

productivity and ownership change, and also for Lichtenberg's (1988)
study of internal costs of adjustment, and is described in detail in
those two papers.

both auxiliary and production establishments in manufacturing, for Census
years from 1963 to 1982.

Table 3 indicates that a similar "failure rate" (36.3

percent in manufacturing) applies to auxiliary establishments. Also as
in the case of production establishments, auxiliary establishments that
close are smaller on average than those that survive.

11

Because we will want to contrast the effects of takeovers on auxil
iary establishments with their effects on production establishments,
and we lack data on nonmanufacturing production establishments, we
present estimates for auxiliary establishments only in manufacturing
as well as for those in all industries.

ii

Despite the fact that the number of establishments closing and
opening is large relative to the number of surviving establishments, and
very large relative to the number changing owners, in the remainder of
this paper we analyze only the data on surviving establishments. Because
we observe establishments that close or open only once, we cannot compare
their employment or wage changes with those of surviving plants.

One

might hypothesize that the probability that an establishment closes is
related to whether or not it changes owners.

In their study of mergers

and acquisitions in the New Jersey economy, however, Yago and Stevenson
(1986) found no evidence of plant closings occurring as a result of

hostile takeovers. Also, Brown and Medoff (1988, pp. 22-23) reported
that including firms that 'died" in their sample did not materially
affect their results.'2
Among the surviving establishments, those that change owners are
smaller and pay lower wages than those that do not.

To calculate the percent of employees affected

by changes in ownership, we can weight the number of establishments by
their respective mean employment; in manufacturing, the proportion of
employees affected is 6.5 percent.13
Perhaps the most interesting statistics in Table 3 are the mean
growth rates (changes in logarithms) of employment and wages.

growth in auxiliary establishments that changed owners was 19 percent

The differences between growth rates are interesting and suggestive,
but for at least two reasons one might believe that the simple differences are biased estimates of the true effects of ownership change.
First, the data analyzed in Table 3 were not standardized by industry.
If the incidence of ownership change is greater in industries with above-

or below-average employment growth, then differences between

unstsndardized growth

/

rates may prnvide a distorted picture of the impact

of ownership change on employment. Blair (1988) found that the level of
merger activity tends to be higher in industries experiencing lower
employment growth, suggesting that the estimates reported above overstate
the industry-adjusted differential.

Second, it is well known that there is a strong negative correlation
between the initial size of firms and their subsequent growth rates.
Hall (1987, p. 603) has recently shown that "neither measurement error in
employment nor sample attrition can account for the negative coefficient
on firm size in the growth rate equation." Since establishments changing
owners sre smaller than those not changing owners,

We can eliminate both of the potential biases (which may be offsetting) by estimating regression models of the form

In ownership of auxiliary establishments: the mean relative

In contrast,

relaxing the restrictions has a substantial impact on

the estimated wage effects: controlling for industry and the initial

wage level, mean wage growth of auxiliary establishments changing
is 9.2 percentage points lower (6.0 percentage points in manufacturing)
than that of establishments not changing owners.

These estimates imply

that employment and real wages fell significantly more in auxiliary

14

establishments changing owners between 1977 and 1982 than in those that
did not.
In addition to estimating the effect of ownership change on the
total employment of auxiliary establishments, for a subset of establish-

ments we can also estimate the effect on R&D employment, i.e. the number
of persons whose principal activity is reaearch,

development, and test-

from this equation is —.039 (0.5): The estimate is

less than one-fourth as large in magnitude as the corresponding estimate
for total

employment, and it is far from statistically significant.

Hence we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no difference between
establishments changing and not changing owners in the growth of R&D
employment. This finding is consistent with that of Hall (1988), who
"found very little evidence in the existing data (through 1985) that
acquisitions cause a reduction in R&D spending;

in the aggregate, firms

involved in mergers showed no difference in their pre and post—merger R&D
performance over those not so involved."
In order to contrast the effects of ownership change on auxiliary
establishments with its effects on production establishments, we also

results are shown in the last line of Table 4.

Ownership change is

associated with relative declines in employment and wages in production
establishments, but the magnitudes of the declines is only about
one-third those for auxiliary establishments, The growth rate of employment is 4.5 percentage points lower for production establishments changing owners between 1976 and 1981 than it is for other production
establishments, controlling for industry and initial size.

As noted

earlier, production establishments changing owners tend to have higher
employment growth in the first several years after ownership change than
production establishments that have not changed owners; the negative net

The wage effects shown in Table 4 are based on the definition of the

i.e. supplementary labor compensation is

In the case of production establishments, we were also able to

estimate the model for X defined as total compensation (payroll plus
supplementary compensation) per employee.

Using this more comprehensive

wage measure changes the estimated wage effect

Data limitations forced us to define t as 1981 rather than 1982.
Because we observe auxiliary establishments only twice, we cannot
determine for them the extent to which the decline in relative
employment and wages occurs before vs. after ownership change.

16

compensation to aggregate total compensation is about .2, this implies
that the effect of ownership change on supplements per employee is -.061,

so that ownership change reduces the ratio of auxiliary establishment

Evaluated at this popula-

about 7.2 auxiliary establishment jobs for every 1000 production establishment jobs.

This reduction in N is consistent with the examples of

"restructuring" described earlier in the paper.

total-factor productivity, the measure of labor input we used did not

this represents a percentage error of about 23 percent.

To assess the resulting error in the estimate of the effect of ownership
change on TFP growth, we need merely to multiply c by (-1 times) labor's
share in gross output, which is approximately 1/3.

Because true relative

labor input fell 1.03 percentage points more than we had estimated, true
relative TFP increased .34 percentage points more than we had estimated.
We had previously estimated that ownership change is associated with
relative TFP increases of .42 to .51 percentage points.18

Thus, our

estimate of the effect of ownership change on TFP is increased about
-- when we

for changes in auxiliary-establishment employment.
The preceding calculations were implicitly predicated on

We have not investigated

whether employment growth in production establishments owned by firms

that - 045 is

Then the magnitude of our estimates

The correction to our previous paper's estimate of the relative TIP increase
associated with ownership change is also proportionately reduced, from .31
to .18 percentage points.

Our admittedly crude attempt to adjust for

employment growth in nonacquired establishments of acquiring firms thus
reduces the size of the effects of interest,

but it does so only in

manufacturing, and even there the effects remain sizeable after adjustment.
Up until now we have been analyzing one kind of relative-employment
effect of ownership change:

its effect on the ratio of

auxiliary-establishment employment to production-establishment employment.

As we noted earlier, theCensus data enable us to distinguish

between two different types of employees in production establishments:
production and nonproduction workers. About one—fourth of
production-establishment employees are nonproduction workers.
Nonproduction workers in production establishments (denoted NP) may be
more similar to auxiliary-establishment employees (denoted A), in terms
of the nature of their work and their earnings (skill) levels, than they
are to production employees in production establishments (denoted

The figure -.082 in the first row and column indicates that establishments that will change owners between four and five years later on
average employ 8.2 percent fewer workers than those that will not change
owners.

As in the case of auxiliary establishments, the probability of

future ownership change is inversely related to current size.

The first

column clearly documents the fact noted earlier, that the relative total
employment of plants changing owners declines sharply until immediately
after the change, and then increases slightly.21

22

As columns 2 and 3 of Table 5 show, the data on total employment
mark very different pstterns for production and nonproduction employment.
Whereas plants changing owners on average employ 7-13 percent fewer
production workers than plants not changing owners in every year from t-5
to t+4, they employ 1-2 percent more nonproduction workers in every year,
and the differences are mostly significant.

The ratio of nonproduction

to production employees is 9-16 percent higher in plants changing owners
Moreover, the decline in relative employment prior to ownership change,
is confined almost entirely to

and the partial subsequent recovery,

production-worker employment. There is very little movement over time in
the relative employment of nonproduction workers.
In order to obtain estimates of the effects of ownership change on
PP and NP workers that are comparable to our estimates of the effects on
A workers, we compute averages of the 5 five-year differences

V.

The relationship between firm

size and

administrative intensity

Table 2 provided aggregate time-series data on the relationship
between auxiliary-establishment employment and production-establishment
employment.

We believe that firm—level cross-sectional dàtacbaracterIz-

ing this relationship are also of interest.

A number of economists and

organization theorists have developed theoretical models of the hierarchical or administrative structure of organizations, which have testable
implications for the relationship between the number of administrative
employees A and the number of production employees P.

Starbuck (1964, p.

499) observes that early organization theorists tended to view the
administrative structure as a pyramidal hierarchy. One man comprises the
top level in this hierarchy; be has S subordinates who comprise the
second level; each of these has S subordinates, giving S2 people in the
third level; and so forth.

(S is referred to as the "span of control.")

The total number of administrators in a hierarchy with X levels is A =
(5X -

1)/(S

—

1).

If there are

production workers per foreman then the

24

total number of production workers is P = a .

and total

emploent

is

T=A+P=—+a

S

Al

Starbuck showed that, for plausible, assumed values of S and a, the ratio
A/P would be essentially independent of T (or A) for values of T above a
relatively low threshliold (i.e., 1

100).

In other words, increasing

the dumber A of hierarchical levels of an organization (hence its size 1)
would generally not result in an increase in the proportion of administrative employees.L2 Similarly, Beckmann (1977, p. 1) argued that the
claim that 'increasing size of the organization burdens every productive
worker with an ever increasing number of administrators per production
worker" was not theoretically valid.

Previous theorists, such as Knight

and Kaldor, had hypothesized that there are increasing costs of administration per worker; in the presence of increasing returns to production
activities (which they also hypothesized), the existence of an optimal
firm size required there to be diseconomies of administration.
Existing evidence on the relationship across organizations between
administrative-intensity (A/P) and size (T) is very limited.
(1964, PP. 501-2) cites four studies:

25

kinds, which found a slightly negative relationship. We seek to shed
further light on this relationship by examining the correlation across
firms between total firm employment and either (a) total employment in
auxiliary establishments or (b) managerial and administrative employment
in auxiliary establishments. Data on total firm employment were obtained
from a third data source, the NSF/Census Survey of Industrial R&D.23
Parent-company identification codes were used to aggregate auxiliary
establishment employment data to the firm level and then to link them
with the data from the R&D survey.

This yielded a sample of almost 2800

firms, which was biased towards large, R&D-intensive firms in

manufacturing.
Perhaps the most straightforward way to examine this relationship,
and to test the hypothesis of increasing costs of administration, would
be to regress the logarithm of auxiliary-establishment employment on the
logarithm of total employment. But 55 percent of the firms in our sample
did not have any auxiliary establishments.24 Therefore we decided to
examine this relationship nonparametrically, by ranking and grouping the
firms into 10 size classes on the basis of total employment, and computing the ratio of auxiliary establishment employment (or managerial and
administrative employment in these establishments) to total firm employment in each class.

We computed both weighted ratios (i.e., the ratio of

class means) and unweighted ratios (i.e., the class mean of the ratio);
the latter is more sensitive to outliers,
size classes.

26

strong

support

for the hypothesis that both auxiliary establishment

employment as a whole, and its administrative and managerial component,
increase more than proportionately with firm size.

These findings appear

to be inconsistent with the pyramidal model of administrative structure
sketched above,

We need to recognize, however, that because managers and

administrators are employed in production establishments as well as in
auxiliary establishments

about 25 percent of production establishment

employees are nonproduction workers

the data in Table 3 may partly

reflect the fact that larger firms locate a larger fraction of their
nonproduction activities in auxiliary establishments. Although it would
be possible in principle to control and test for this, we have not had
the opportunity to do this,

Thus it is perhaps premature to reject the

hypothesis of nonincreasing costs of administration.
VI.

Summary

and

conclusions

In this paper we have reported analyses of three large Census Bureau
establishment— or firm—level data sets designed to yield insight into the
effect of changes in ownership on the employment and wages of several
important categories of workers. We were particularly concerned with the
effects on workers in auxiliary establishments, since it is there that
top managers and administrators and many R&D personnel are employed.
Since the number of these (relatively highly—paid) workers is small
compared to the number in production establishments, the effects of
ownership change on them have not been captured or have been heavily
masked in previous studies of the labor impact of takeovers.
One of our major findings is that employment growth is much lower -17 percentage points lower over 5 years

in auxiliary establishments

changing owners than in those not changing owners.

Mean employment

27

growth is slightly positive for establishments not changing owners,
is sharply negative for establishments changing owners.

arid

There is,

however, no significant difference between changers and nonchangers in
the growth of R&D employment.
The increase in payroll per employee was 9 percentage points lower
among auxiliary establishments changing owners than it was among other
auxiliary establishments, controlling for industry and the initial wage
rate,

The relative decline in total compensation (including supplements

to payroll) was perhaps 1/3 higher, about 12 percentage points.
The relative declines in employment and wages of workers in auxiliary establishments are about three times as great as the corresponding
declines in production establishments. (In the latter case, the data
indicate that the declines occur immediately before ownership change and
are to a small extent reversed soon after.

Unfortunately, due to the low

frequency of the auxiliary establishment data, we cannot determine how
much of the employment and wage declines there occurred before vs. after
in reducownership change.) This implies that ownership change results
tions in the wage and especially in the employment of auxiliary-establishment employees relative to those of production-establishment
employees.

Taken at face value, it implies that the ratio of auxiliary-

establishment to production-establishment employment declines 11.2 percent
in firms involved in ownership change relative to firms not so involved.
This translates into the elimination of 7.2 auxiliary establishment jobs
for every 1000 production establishment jobs.
Some people express concern about the number of lawyers, investment
or
bankers, and other highly-paid professionals devoted to facilitating

28

implnenting takeovers, and think thst this may constitute a waate of
valuable human resources

in thia activity may not be high relstive to the quantity and quality of

failed to account for auxiliary-establishment employment
in our earlier investigstion cf the effects of ownership change on
Because we

productivity, we

may bsve underestimated tbe productivity gain associated

with ownership change by as much as 42 percent. The underestimate may
not have been that great, however, if the declines in employment in
auxiliary establishments changing owners are partially offset by increases in employment in other auxiliary establishments owned by acquiring
firms.

There is no evidence that this is the case in the economy as a

whole, but the data just for manufacturing (which may be more reliable)
are consistent with the hypothesis of partially-offsetting employment
increases in these other establishments. An admittedly crude attempt to
adjust for this reduces from 16 to 11 percent the magnitude of the
relative auxiliary—establishment employment decline of firms involved in
ownership change.

A

more refined analysis of this issue is warranted,

however.
In addition to revealing important differences between the effects
of ownership change on auxiliary and production establishments, our
analysis also indicated clear (although smaller) differences between its
effects on production and nonproduction workers in production establishments.

Only the production employees in these establishments appear to

experience relative employment declines in connection with changes in
ownership. Because the relative employment of nonproduction employees in
production establishments doesn't decline, the overall ratio of

29

"indirect' to "direct
change.

labor isn't reduced in the course of ownership

But the composition or locus of indirect labdr does change

significantly, as the fraction of it accounted for by au.xiliary establishments is reduced.
The paper also provided some evidence concerning the relationship
between firm size and administrative-intensity, defined as the ratio of
auxiliary-establishment employment to total firm employment. Certain
models of organizational structure imply that administrative-intensity
should be constant or even declining with respect to firm size throughout
most of the range of firm size, but our data reveal an almost strIctly
increasing relationship throughout the range.

Here,

too, further re-

search is needed to illuminate the nature of returns to scale in
administration.
