PRICING TO MARKET IN JAPANESE MANUFACTURING

ABSTRACT

This paper investigates pricing by Japanese manufacturing
firms

in

export and domestic markets.

The paper reports

equations explaining the margin between export prices in yen and
domestic prices for a wide range of final goods including many of
the electronic and transport products which have figured so
prominently in recent trade discussions.

Evidence is presented

showing that Japanese firms respond to changes in real exchange
rates by "pricing to market", varying their export prices in yen
relative to their domestic prices.

The empirical specification

makes it possible to disentangle planned changes in the margin
between export and domestic prices from inadvertent changes in
this margin due to unanticipated changes in exchange rates.

The

degree of pricing to market varies widely across products, but
there is strong evidence that pricing to market occurs.

The

paper also investigates whether pricing to market has increased
in scale in the period since 1985 when the yen began a sustained
appreciation, but finds that only five of seventeen products
experienced a shift in price behavior over that period.

In the last ten years, exporting firms in the industrial
countries have had to cope with unprecedented changes in real
exchange rates.

In order to remain competitive, many firms in

these countries are said to have followed pricing policies
designed to keep export prices competitive despite changes in
exchange rates.

In response to an appreciation of the domestic

currency, for example, these firms have reduced the domestic
currency prices of products destined for export markets in order
to limit increases in the foreign currency prices of these
products.

Such pricing behavior, because it opens up a margin

between export and domestic prices of the same product, has been
termed "pricing to market" by Krugman (1987) and others.1
This paper examines the pricing to market behavior of
Japanese manufacturing firms during the 1980s usIng an unusually
detailed set of export and domestic price data published by the
Bank of Japan.

The paper reports equations explaining the margin

between export and domestic prices for a wide range of final
goods including many of the electronic and transport products
which have figured so prominently in recent trade discussions,
For each product, pricing to market elasticities are estimated
which show how changes in real exchange rates lead to variations
in the ratio of export to domestic prices.

The empirical

specification makes it possible to disentangle planned changes in
the margin between export and domestic prices from inadvertent
changes in this margin due to unanticipated changes in exchange
rates.

Most previous studies of foreign pricing have focused on
exchange rate pass—through rather than pricing to market.

The

two phenomena are closely related, as will be seen below, but
estimates of pass—through elasticities depend more critically on
the specification of cost functions. Estimates of pricing to
market elasticities, which measure how the ratio of export prices
to domestic prices respond to exchange rates, are less sensitive
to errors in specifying cost functions, since under most
conditions costs have little if any effect on this price ratio,
The first section of the paper develops a model of pricing

to market based on the markup behavior

of exporting firms.

Markup behavior is crucial because it is through varying markups
that firms limit the impact of exchange rates on their
conpetitivemess.

Although the model allows for different types

of demand and cost behavior, it leads to a simple pricing to
market equation which specifies the margin between export and
donestic prices as a function of real exchange rates, real wages,

and other factors.

The second section investigates how the

margin between export and domestic prices may be temporarily
affected by unanticipated changes in exchange rates,

If firms

set prices in foreign currency for more than one period, then an
unanticipated depreciation or appreciation will change price
margins even in the absence of pricing to market.

One of the

to separate
challenges of empirical work on pricing to market is

out these unanticipated effects from planned changes

A Model

of Pricing to Market

Pricing to market behavior can be seen most clearly if we
consider the case of a monopolist firm in the ith industry
producing in the domestic country but selling in both domestic
and export markets.

The firm

sells

in the domestic market at a

price Pit and in the export market at a price
being expressed in foreign currency.

If there is effective

arbitrage between the two markets, then the two prices are tied

prevents any pricing to market from occurring.

If commodity

arbitrage by third parties is ineffective,2 however, then the
firm

will

in general set different prices in the two markets even

when expressed in domestic currency.

And the firm

will

in response to changes in either demand or cost conditions.

It

is this ratio of the export to domestic prices of the same good

which is termed the export—domestic price margin.
A. Demand and cost behavior

while N(.) is the markup of the foreign price (expressed in

If the demand elasticities are constant (case 1 below), then the

markups will be constant as well.

In more general cases, the

markups may rise or fall as the price of the good rises.

The price

in one market is generally not independent of the

price in the other because each is tied to a common marginal
cost.

That is, since marginal cost is a function of total

output, changes in one price may induce changes in the other
price indirectly through changes in marginal cost,

ifl

order to

determine the effects of demand and cost factors on relative
prices, the first order conditions are totally differentiated and
solved for the domestic and export prices.

In

the next two

sections the elasticities of these prices with respect to the
independent variables are described in detail.

EajgifltQlirket: the Effects

of

a±flepreciatiociation

This section examines the effects of a depreciation of the
domestic currency on the foreign and domestic prices of a good
As shown below, the depreciation directly

produced at home,

lowers marginal costs expressed in domestic currency (C1/St), so
the foreign price of the good (Qt) must

The domestic

price of the good, in contrast, changes only if the depreciation
leads to changes in marginal costs expressed in domestic
currency.

Finally, the ratio of foreign to domestic prices may

rise or fall depending on demand and cost behavior.
Consider first the foreign currency price of the good
destined for the foreign market ("the foreign price").

In order for pricing to market to occur, markups must vary

with prices.

In

the case of any demand curve which

is less

convex than a constant elasticity curve, a rise in prices reduces

the markup of prices over marginal costs and
increases this markup.

This case encompasses a wide range of

curves including any demand curve more linear than the
constant elasticity curve such as the linear curve itself.8

Consider first the pass—through effect.

Since a

depreciation of the domestic currency lowers the foreign price
(in foreign currency), it increases the

markup of this price over

marginal cost expressed in foreign currency.

the markup of this price

So the margin between foreign and

domestic prices still widens (a1 >

0).

In fact, regardless of

whether marginal costs increase or.remain constant, the PTM
elasticity is between zero and unity (i.e., 0 <

a

<

1).

So the

margin between foreign and domestic prices increases by a
fraction of the rise in the exchange rate.
Consider the example of Japanese goods destined for the U.S.
market.

If the yen depreciates, the prices of U,S.-destined

goods fall in terms of dollars.

But because Japanese firms

increase their markups, the "pass—through" is less than
in terms of yen
proportional to the depreciation, so the prices
must rise. That opens a gap between the prices of goods destined
for the Japanese and U.S. markets.

The increase

in the

export

domestic price margin can be anywhere between zero and 100
percent of the depreciation.

Similarly, if the yen appreciates,

as it has since 1985, then the prices of U,S.—destined goods rise
10

in dollars, but the increase is less than proportional to the
exchange rate because the yen prices of these goods fall.

a

As

result, Japanese goods become less expensive abroad than at hone.
This second case with varying markups will be of central
interest in the empirical work below.

To complete the discussion

of markup behavior, however, a third possible case should be
mentioned where demand curves are more convex rather than less
convex than the constant elasticity case.

Then markup

elasticities are positive rather than negative
PTM

elasticities are

negative (°i <

(6,

r

>

0), and

An appreciation of the

yen leads to an increase in the foreign currency prices

of

exports that is more than proportional to the appreciation.

This

third case is inconsistent with PTh behavior as usually
described, but it is possible that such behavior nay characterize
some industries.

C

Influence of Other Factors on Foreign-Domestic Price Margins

Any factor influencing costs or demands in either country
can potentially affect the ratio of export to domestic prices.
But as this section shows, cost factors influence export—
domestic price margins only under certain demand conditions.

And

general price levels influence export—domestic price margins in
a symmetric fashion which allows these margins to be expressed in

terms
(i)

of

rather than nominal exchange rates.

Cost factors:
According to the cost function (3), both wages and raw

material prices can influence costs, and indirectly influence

prices, in both foreign and domestic markets.

In order to affect

Both current and lagged real exchange rates enter the

relative weight of contemporaneous and lagged pricing.

Since

goods with prices set with a j period lag may have different PTM
elasticities than those with some other lag, it is necessary to
specify a different PTM elasticity, a1j, for each lag length, j.

III. Estimation of

the Price Equations

This section reports equations explaining export-domestic
price margins for seventeen Japanese products.

The data are

first described (with further detail provided in the data
appendix), then the empirical results are discussed.
A. Description of the Data

The Bank

of Japan reports prices for a large number of

disaggregated prodUcts.1-8

This paper focuses on seventeen final

products for which both export and domestic prices are available.
19

The domestic prices are those reported at the primary wholesale
level for sale in Japan, while the export prices are FOB export
prices expressed in yen.
2.

The products are listed in Tables

and

1

Most of the products are drawn fron the electrical machinery

and transport industries. All of the products have significant
export markets in the United States and other industrial
countries, and most are products which have figured prominently
in recent trade discussions.

These products are exported to a wide range of countries.
Thus the noninal and real exchange rates appearing in (19) should
be

efqgve exchange

rates defined over prices and exchange

rates for a number of countries which import Japanese products.
The foreign output variable, similarly, should be a weighted
average of foreign outputs.

shares by product with categories roughly corresponding to those
in Tables 1 and 2,19
weights for

These export shares are used to form

ggt—segjfic series for the nominal and real

exchange rates and foreign industrial production.

For example,

there are series for the nominal and real exchange rates and
industrial production used in the equation for color televisions
based on export shares for color televisions,
To form the nominal exchange rate series for each product,
the export shares for that product are used to weight the
corresponding bile teral exchange rates forming a productspecific, nominal effective exchange rate.

To foro the real

exchange rate series for each product, wholesale prices are first

B. Estimation Results

Tables I and 2 report equations explaining the exportdonestic price margin for seventeen Japanese final products.

The

equations are estinated over the period from February 1980 to
December 1987, so there are a total of 95 monthly observations.
To reduce spurious correlation between variables, each
variable is expressed as the firstdiffereng of its log value.
The dependent variable in each equation is the export-domestic
price margin for that product (expressed as the first-difference
of its log value), defined as the price of exports in yen
relative to the domestio price of that sane product.

The

independent variables consist of distributed lags for the firstdifferenoes of

the domestic price by over 0.5 percent.
The PTN elasticities are significantly greater than zero in
all equations except the equation for small trucks.

The

to 1.14 in the tire and tube equation (a coefficient which is
insignificantly different from one).

So PTM behavior takes the

standard form described in case 2 above:

Like in

evidence of pricing to market behavior of the conventional type:
variations in the exportdonestic price margin help to dampen the
effects of exchange rate changes on export prices in foreign
currency,

For the other two products in Table 3, small passenger cars
and motor cycles, both PTM elasticities are statistically
significant.

In these Industries, Japanese firms evidently

priced to market throughout the sample period, but varied their
prices more sharply when the yen appreciated after 1985.

In the

case of small passenger cars, for example, the PTM elasticity

the PTM elasticity defined over the period since February 1985

is

the twelve other products in Tables 1 and 2,
there is no evidence of higher PTM elasticities in the perioc
since February 1985; the coefficients of the PTM terms defines
over the period since February 1985 are statistically
insignificant at the five percent level. Thus pricing to narket
appears to be invariant with respect to the Jirection of exchange
rate changes except for those five products reported in Tate 3.

Concluding Remarks

firms over the last eight years.

followed by a sharp appreciation.

responded

The paper studies how

to shifts in

the

real exchange rate by

prices of their exports relative to prices of

products destined for the domestic macset.

The paper provides strong evidence that export-donestic

price margins are varied systematically in ways consistent with

the theoretical model outlined above.

The most important

influence on these margins is the real exchange rate, with PTM
elasticities being significantly greater than zero in all but two
of the seventeen equations.

There is some evidence that PTM

elasticities are higher in periods when the yen appreciates,
although this is true only in the case of five of the seventeen
products.

The estimation distinguishes between inadvertent but

temporary changes in these margins due to exchange rate surprises

and planned changes associated with PTh behavior, So the PTM
elasticities which are estimated represent variations in this
margin planned by Japanese firms to keep their products
competitive abroad. The PTh elasticities vary widely across
products, but there is overwhelming evidence that exportdomestic price margins are systematically varied to help Japanese
firms protect their competitive position.

Without PTM behavior,

recent variations in real exchange rates would have placed a much
greater burden of adjustment on Japanese output and employment.

1. Other recent studies of pricing to market

The firm's pricing policy might be undermined by third parties
who buy in the low price market and sell in the high price
market, but there are usually official and unofficial barriers to
third party arbitrage for the types of products studied in this
paper, Kruqman (1987) cites the example of German automobiles
whose prices in the United States greatly exceeded prices in
Germany (expressed in dollars). A gray market developed for
automobiles bought by third parties in Germany and shipped to the
United States, but this gray market never eliminated the large
margin between prices in the two markets.

derivative of marginal cost (C1) with respect to total
output. Similar notation is used for other derivatives,
4. M1, N1 are

[(

5. For example, H11 =
Pt)/(Cl h1)] J11 where [J) is the
matrix of second derivatives of the profit function. Since the
second order conditions imply that (J] is negative semidefinitc,
< 0. So H11 > 0 since C1 > 0 (i.e., marginal cost is
positive) and h1 < 0 (the demand curve is negatively slcped).
6. The domestic markup elasticity can be written in terms of the
elasticity of the demand curve as follows:
6

(Cp

t)/(

(c—I)

The derivative of the demand elasticity with respect to prices,
depends on the curvature of the demand curve.
7. As Krugman (1987) points out, the dependence of PTM effects on
demand behavior parallels the tariff effects in the recent

,

theoretical literature on protection under imperfect competition.
For a similar analysis of pass—through effects, see Feenstra
(1987).

H

8. Feenstra (1987) describes this case as the "normal" case,
shows that the pass—through elasticity is between zero and minus
one in this case.

34

9. As discussed above, the markup elasticities depend on the
derivatives of the demand elasticities with respect to prices, so
it is curvature of the demand curves which matters, not just the
elasticities themselves,
10. If both markup elasticities are negative (case 2 above), for
example, but the markup elasticity is greater in the foreign
market (r < 5 < 0), then a rise in either cost factor reduces the
ratio of foreign to domestic prices.
