MARKET VALUE VS. FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING MEASURES OF NATIONAL SAVING

ABSTRACT

Although National Income and Product Account (NIPA) saving
measures, and especially NIPA saving rates, are widely used in both
scholarly and journalistic treatments, they are seriously defective as
representations of the variables derived from economic analysis, either
for measuring economic performance or as elements of the explanation for

consumption behavior. The cost-based value of a restricted class of
assets recorded in the national income and product accounts is a version
of the financial accounting for the tangible assets of a business firm.
Economic analysis calls instead for the current asset market value of
business enterprises (and their equivalents) as the measure of wealth,

and the annual change in that value as the measure of saving. National
Balance Sheet data on wealth at asset market value presented in this
paper show that NIPA saving measures are not good proxies for market

value measures. The picture of recent national saving experience that
emerges from market value data is quite different. Various conceptual
and data quality issues are discussed.

MARKET VALUE VS. FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING MEASURES OF NATIONAL SAVING
David F. Bradford

Introduction

This essay is a venture into veil-trodden terrain: the definition
of saving. Because so many others have thought about the same issues,
probably nothing I say here has not been said before by someone else.

J. R. Hicks (1946) mapped the territory in a particularly well-known
theoretical treatment. More recently, Auerbach (1984), Boskin (1986,
1988), Eisner (1980, 1988), Goldsmith (1982), Peek (1986), Ruggles and

Ruggles (1981), and Shoven (1984) have discussed many of the points
raised here in connection with empirical explorations of saving and

wealth. In his presidential address to the American Economic
Association, Eisner (forthcoming) included the main theses argued here
in a broadside indictment of the divergence between measurement and

theory to be found in economics. This paper differs, perhaps, in degree
of emphasis of two propositions. The minor theme is that saving should
be defined by reference to the underlying concept of wealth to which the

saving is an increment. The major theme is that the most useful wealth
concept is the market value of assets, not thecost-based measure of
capital implied by the use of national income and product account (NIPA)

saving. Whereas NIPA investment measures tell us something about the
margin of productive additions to the stock of wealth in a particular
form, the (definitionally equal) saving measures are neither those that

2

the microeconontic theory of consumption explains nor those appropriate

to assess national economic performance.
Inspection of a sample of the extensive literature commenting on

and analyzing national saving has surprised me by the diversity of

positions, often implicit, on these issues. It appears that the
macroeconomists are truer to microeconomic principles than are many of

those who approach the subject from a public finance perspective. The
fact that so much research is carried out making use of statistical
measures of saving that seem to me to bear so little relationship to
economic theory suggests there is a place for a review of fundamentals
and display of some basic data related to them.
Income. Saving, and Wealth
Beginning students are taught that saving is a residual, what is
left from personal income after deducting consumption and taxes, or
after deducting from aggregate income consumption by households and

governments. But saving is also conceived of as an addition to wealth,
and it is not always recognized that the three ideas - income, and wealth --

consumption,

are not independent. Defining any two determines

the definition of the third. The Schanz-Haig-Siaons (SHS) conception of
income familiar to public finance takes the ideas of consumption and
wealth as fundamental and defines income as the sum of consumption and

the change in wealth during an accounting period. The basic notion of
wealth, in turn, is the market value of a household's (or household

3

aggregate's) stock of claims on goods and services in the future.1 This
is the approach to saving taken by the microeconomic theory of household
behavior.

Most commentary on and analysis of national saving, by contrast,

start with a NIPA definition of income. To make life confusing, the
term "income" in the national income account context is attached to
factor payments, and makes distinctions between taxes regarded as
falling on factor payments and those that do not (indirect business

taxes). It is doubtful that there is an economically meaningful
distinction between taxes that bear on factor payments and those that do

not. We can cut through the problem if, for the concept of income in
the SHS sense, we read "product" in the national accounting sense.
Which of the three notions -•

is

product,

consumption, and wealth - -

fundamental in the case of national income accounting is not

immediately obvious. As is well known, national income accounts involve

two conceptions of product, gross and net. Gross national product, "the
market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property
supplied by residents of the United States,"2 and consumption, personal
and governmental, can reasonably be described as the fundamental ideas.
Together (by subtraction) they define gross investment and saving. To
reach

product,

investment, and

saving, it is necessary to

subtract an allowance for the using up of the reproducible capital

stock, a wealth notion. Here, then, it is the wealth and consumption
ideas that are fundamental: We can think of net product (income) as
definitionally equal to the sum of consumption (personal and
governmental) and the change in the reproducible capital stock owned by
U.S. residents.

NIPA Saving and Financial Accounting
In its treatment of business investment and its yield, the NIPA
net income concept can be loosely characterized as a consolidation of

the account books of business firms. This is not to suggest that the
NIPA accountants actually aggregate the income statements and balance

sheets of firms. It is rather to emphasize that investment (and
therefore saving) in the national income and product accounts consists
of acquisitions of tangible property and is, furthermore, cost-based,
constructed from historical data on expenditures for machines,

structures, and inventories. Increments in the value of intangible
property and (what may be the same thing) revaluations of tangible
property arising from its location within going businesses are excluded

from the NIPA income and saving concepts. Net saving in the national
income and product accounts constitutes the change in the stock of

reproducible business capital.3 The NIPA capital data can be thought of

For this purpose, owner-occupiers can be thought of as in the
business of providing housing services. Other household-owned and
-employed capital (consumer durables) is excluded from the NIPA
investment and capital concepts, but that is not my main concern here.

5

as the figures financial accountants would present if they used the NIPA
depreciation conventions and adjusted their historical cost-based
entries on tangible assets (including inventories) annualiy to what they
would be had historical prices been instead at current levels.
The main difference between the two conceptions of wealth

corresponds roughly to the difference between financial accounting for
the net worth of business firms, on the one hand, and the market
valuation of those firms, on the other ("roughly" because financial
accounts include intangible assets acquired by purchase from another
firm). The difference is sometiiiies summed up as that between

recognition or not of "capital gains," but this description hides as

much as it reveals. The market value of the equity of a firm may differ
from the "book" value of its tangible property for many reasons,
including changes in the supply price of the capital items in question
(for which national income accounting makes a correction), changes in
discount rates, and changes in the beliefs about the future upon which
market valuation of assets depends -

- all

of these give rise to capital

gains in the popular sense of the term. But the two values also may
differ because of the genuinely stochastic character of the returns on
investment and the conservative quality of business accounts, which
result in little or no tracking of the accumulation of intangible
capital and of such assets as proven oil reserves.

6

EmDirical Relevance: A First Look

Available

data suggest that the difference in definition

corresponds to a significant difference in aggregate wealth measures.
Table 1 shows estimates of the net worth of nonfinancial corporate

business in the United States (including corporate farms) and of the
market value of the equity claims on those firms.

The figures are

derived from the Balance Sheets for the U.S. Economy (hereafter,
National Balance Sheets) prepared by the Board of Governors of the

Federal Reserve System (1984). Net worth consists of the difference
between assets and liabilities on the account books, after various

adjustments. Assets in this case include reproducible assets at
replacement cost (i.e., after adjusting valuation based on historical
cost for changes in the acquisition prices of the same assets), land at

market value, and direct investment abroad by U.S. firms. Liabilities
include all the usual sorts of debt (at book value), profit taxes

payable, and foreign direct investment in the United States. I would
emphasize that in its treatment of fixed investment the net worth in
Table 1 is essentially the concept implicit in NIPA accounting for

saving. The market value of equity is essentially that appropriate for
the SHS saving concept, which, in turn, is the concept MexplainedN by
microeconomic theories of saving behavior.

To derive the aggregate accounting net worth of the corporate sector.
I have added the net worth of corporate farms (line 46 of the Sector
Balance Sheet for the Nonfinancial Business Sector) to the nonfarui,
nonfinancial total (line 43).

7

It is evident from Table I that the market value of equity and the
net worth on firms' books are very different.

The column titled "Market

Value/Net Worth Ratio" shows the ratio of the market value of the equity

claims to the consolidated nonfinancial corporate sector to the
consolidated financial accounting measure of net worth, i.e., the sum of
tangible and financial assets (including direct investment abroad) less
the sum of debt claims (at book value), profit taxes payable, and
foreign direct investment in the United States.

Since 1948 this ratio

has varied over a remarkable range, with a high of 110.1 percent at the
end of 1968 and a low of 36.7 percent at the end of 1978.

With this sort of divergence, one would expect very different
behavior of income and saving measures based on accounting and market

values of wealth. How different is suggested by the column of Table 1
headed "Net Worth less Market to GNP," which shows the ratio of the
difference between the accounting and market value measures as a ratio

to the GNP. According to Table 1, changing from NIPA accounting to
market value measures of saving in the form of nonfinancial corporate
equity claims would result in changes in estimated aggregate income
ranging between an increase of over 7 percent and a decrease of over 62
percent, with a substantial decrease on average.

(This comparison is

simply to emphasize the potential significance of the difference in
points of view under discussion in the present paper.

Since there may

be offsetting changes in other elements of national wealth, an aggregate
income measure that accounted for all saving at market value might not

8

differ as much from the NIPA aggregate.) Figures 1 and 2 make the
points graphically.
It seems clear that the basic objective of the National Balance
Sheets, to measure wealth at market value, is the one appropriate for

discussions of saving. Nevertheless, economists widely accept and use
for this purpose the NIPA saving data. Distinguished examples (and I
make no claim to a systematic review of the literature) include Blades
and Sturm (1982), Boskin and Lau (1988), Campbell (1987), Lipsey and
Kravis (1987), most of the contributors to Lipsey and Tice
(forthcoming), Poterba (1987), and Summers (1985).

In at least some of these instances, lack of market value wealth
data is taken to justify resort to NIPA concepts, and some analysts (for
example Auerbach, 1984; Boskin, 1986, 1988; Poterba and Summers, 1987)
have noted the potential role for the market value data provided in the

National Balance Sheets. Summers and Carroll (1987) explicitly analyze
aggregate saving in the National Balance Sheet sense (although they do

not regard it as preferable to the NIPA measure). Noting that
"[n]ational income account (NIA) data provid, notoriously poor proxies
for the economic concepts of saving and investment," Obstfeld (1986, p.

82) explores some of the biases that may result from the use of NIPA

data in comparing saving and investment behavior of countries. Some
macroeconoinists --

for

example, Hall (1978, 1988) and Campbell and

Deaton (1988) -- go out of their way to avoid measuring saving. Hall,

in particular, has argued that income aggregates are misplaced in

9

macroeconomics; focus

should

instead be on aggregate consumption and

labor earnings. Granting some such exceptions in the literature, I
think it is fair to say that there is wide acceptance of NIPA saving
measures.

In this paper I argue that wealth and consumption are both
important variables in economic models and important measures of
economic performance, that income should be viewed as a derivative
concept in this connection, and that the appropriate concept of wealth

is measured at asset market value. We should use NIPA saving measures
only to the extent that they serve as reasonable proxies for the market

value measures. (This is not to suggest that the corresponding
investment concepts are not useful in the analysis of production.)

Although it is ultimately a statistical question whether the NIPA saving
measures are reasonable proxies, the evidence from the National Balance
Sheets leads me to doubt it.

In the next part of the paper I review the relationship between

the two notions of wealth (and therefore of saving): market value of
assets and financial accounting net worth. I then take up objections to
the use of market value wealth. The fourth section presents time series
data on the behavior of national saving in the United States economy,

and the fifth raises, without solving, some significant problems with
the National Balance Sheet data as measures of market value.

Much attention has been paid in recent years to the saving
performance of U.S. residents, which has been generally judged

10

disappointing. My contention that the NIPA saving aggregates and ratios
of NIPA saving to NIPA income measures are poor indicators upon which to

base conclusions is neither inherently in favor of this assessment nor

opposed to it. One may still be dissatisfied with the U.S. saving
record when it is looked at in the framework suggested by microeconomic

theory. The sixth section presents some observations on this issue.
Concerts of Wealth
Market Value of Assets
The SItS notion of income underlying the base of an income tax (or

at least generally accepted by academic commentators as the Droper base

of an income tax) is the sum

of

the change in the wealth and the

consumption of the taxpaying unit,

be

it an individual or a family.

Consumption and wealth are the primitive concepts, which need to be

given operational substance to produce a tax system. Although the
general ideas seem obvious enough, both pose difficult problems of

definition at the margin. Within limits, the standard to which the
operational definitions refer in a tax policy context is essentially
normative - -

one

starts with a notion of ability to pay and designs the

income measure to implement it. (The limits relate to the
substitutability of different forms of wealth in taxpayer portfolios.)

In Untangling the Income Tax (Bradford 1986) I suggested that
usual arguments justifying the SHS income concept as a tax base imply a
definition of a person's wealth as "the maximum amount of present
consumption he could finance currently by selling or otherwise

11

committing all of his assets" (p. 22). If this definition is accepted,
the operational focus shifts to the identification of "assets" and
quantifying the opportunities of "selling or otherwise committing" them.
Examples of significant but hard to quantify assets are human capital
(the present value of a person's future earning power) and the

discounted value of inheritances. Interestingly, these two are also
examples of assets that are difficult to sell or "otherwise commit."
Proponents of S}(S income taxation normally exclude both human capital

and the value of great expectations from the wealth component of the
definition of income.
Experience with tax administration gives us numerous examples of
the fact that it is the market value of wealth, rather than its
accounting value, that figures in individual behavior.

If tax on

accruing market value (capital gains) is deferred, taxpayers will
concentrate their portfolios in assets that generate accruing value,

rather than cash income. If accounting measures of depreciation are
different from actually accruing changes in value of assets, taxpayers
respond in well known ways.

A simple two-period model of person's intertemporal budget
constraint will help clarify the role and nature of wealth in the
analysis of behavior, in this case the explanation of consumption

levels. For the purpose, we can imagine a world in which there is just
one consumption good and in which labor is supplied jnelastically, with

no welfare significance. We conceive of people as born into this world

12

with inherited resources (to be specified), working one unit of time
during the first period to earn the wage w1 (measured in consumption
units), consuming an amount C1, and applying any excess of the wage over

consumption to purchase assets. In the second period, the person also
works one unit of time to earn the wage w2, and consumes that amount

plus the results of liquidating the assets. The problem is to choose an
amount of first-period consumption and a portfolio of assets.
In the most basic model, there is no uncertainty (so no

information problem). The second-period wage is known

and

there is a

single asset available, which we may think of as a discount bond paying

one unit of consumption in period two. The going price for the asset is
The person is born holding B1 units of the bond, and in the course
of period 1 chooses the number of units of the asset to buy (or sell) so

as to carry B2 units into period 2. Two equations (1) and (2) define
the lifetime budget constraint.

(1)

(2)

C1 + B2p2

—

V1 + B1p2

C2 — B2+w2

The intermediate asset position, B2, can be eliminated between (1)
and (2) to yield a single lifetime budget constraint (3).

(3)

C1 + C2p2

—

w1 + w2p2 + 81p2

13

The right hand side of equation (3), w1 + w2p2 + B1p2, is the market

value of "opening wealth" (including human capital). We see from (3)
that in this simple world we can specify the person's opportunity set

completely with two numbers, opening wealth and p2, the price of claims

on period-two consumption (or the interest rate). To specify the
opportunity set without capitalizing labor services, we need four

numbers, 61p2, v1, w2, and p2: opening nonhuman wealth, wages in the
two periods, and the interest rate.
This simple formulation reminds us that if we are looking forward

from a point in time and want to explain consumption levels, wealth is a

needed piece of information. It also demonstrates that it is not the
only piece of information we need to explain consumption or, a related
problem, to assess a person's welfare, even under the simple, perfect

market conditions of the model. In general, information about prices is
needed --

here,

wages and the interest rate; in a aultiperiod setting,

wages, relative prices of goods, and a term structure of interest rates.
By inspection of condition (3) we see that in the simple model the

welfare of the individual is increasing in opening wealth including
human capital and decreasing in the price of future consumption (i.e.,

increasing in the interest rate). But even in this case, when human
capital is excluded, although welfare is still increasing in opening
wealth, the effect of an increase in the interest rate on the assessment
is indeterminate and hinges on the taste for consumption in period

2.

14

Simply put, a high interest rate is bad for someone who wants to borrow
against tomorrow's earnings to consume more today.5

Initial

nonhuman

wealth

is a given, a parameter, in the model

described above; wealth along the way (initial wealth augmented by

saving) is chosen, endogenous. A complete model would explain initial
wealth, too, so it would drop out of the analysis. Wealth would return
as an explanatory variable, though, with the introduction of

uncertainty. Then the wealth along the way is the result of the
individual person's choice and luck, so second-period consumption would

depend upon the market performance of the portfolio. The same would be
true for the aggregate of individuals.
The model reminds us that to predict the level of consumption we

need to take into account the market value of nonhuman wealth, the

interest rate, and current and future wages. In a stochastic setting
the distribution of future wages could be correlated with the value of

nonhuman wealth, marketed and unmarketed. In particular, one might
expect workers observing prosperity (high market value of wealth) to

raise their forecasts of future wages. If we take into account that
lifetime labor supply is chosen along with consumption levels, it is far

The importance of intertemporal prices (interest rates) is often
overlooked in assessments of welfare. Summers (1983) develops a costof-living series corrected for interest rate changes, applicable to a
person with a given amount of wealth (and no anticipated earnings).

15

from clear what sort of consumption behavior one ought to expect to see
associated with movements in the market value of wealth.6

With enough simplifying assumptions. though, one can derive from
the general approach outlined above the conclusion that a person's
current consumption will be a function of his forecasted labor earnings

and current wealth, .g.,

C — aEt[wt+iLt+i] + bW,
where a and b are constants, E is the expectation conditional on
information at time t,

and

W is the (stochastic) market value of

nonhuman wealth.7 Such a model will generate a time path of consumption
and wealth, and hence of saving, defined as the change in wealth. The
point to emphasize here is that such regularity as the models do lead us
to look for is in the relationship among consumption, labor earnings,
and wealth at market value.

Net Worth as an Accounting Idea
We can capture in a crude way the role for financial accounting in
the simple model of behavior by adding an explicit real asset, say a

certain number of machines, M1, as another element of endowment. In the
typical financial accounting context, there is no readily observable

market for fixed capital. Assume, therefore, that the machines are

6 For examples of more refined intertemporal models see Campbell and
Deaton (1988), Ingersoll (1987, Ch. 11), Merton (1971, 1973).
For a classic -example of such a model, see Ando and Modigliani
(1963). For recent examples, see Blinder and Deaton (1985), Deaton
(1987), Hall (1978, 1988).

16

inalienable (i.e., they cannot be sold). The number of machines is
tracked by the financial accounts. A machine generates output O
period two.

would be stochastic in a realistic model.) Then the

budget constraint is expressed by equations (4) and (5); the singleconstraint version that eliminates the financial assets carried over is
expressed by (6).

It is evident from (6) that in a world of certainty, with unlimited
borrowing and lending of the financial asset, the only use of the
financial accounting information is to provide a basis for estimating

what the market value of the machines would be (OM1p2). If one knows
the market value of the machines, the accounting information is
superfluous.

Complicating the model by introducing an explicit treatment of
uncertainty and asymmetries of information does not suggest a further

role for financial accounting information. With complete Arrow-Debreu
contingent claim markets, the market value of wealth continues to define

the position of the budget constraint. Owing to the increased number of

17

prices, ambiguities about the signs of derivatives multiply in welfare
comparisons or positive predictions of the effect of changes in
parameters on consumption or labor supply.

Missing markets,

asymmetries, liquidity constraints, and the like render budget sets
nonlinear and reduce the information contained in any single parameter,
such as initial wealth, of the individual's problem.

Nevertheless,

there does not appear to be a general role for accounting information

except as the basis for estimating implicit market values.
The function of financial accounting for a business firm is not to

duplicate market valuation. A clear statement of this point is
presented in an official pronouncement of the Financial Accounting

Standards Board: "Financial accounting is not designed to measure
directly the value of a business enterprise, but the information it
provides may be helpful to those who wish to estimate its value"
(Financial Accounting Standards Board, 1978, as excerpted in Gibson and

Frishkoff, 1986, p. 19). Financial accounting for asset value and
market value converge where there is an actual transaction that renders

the market value objectively measurable. Between transactions,
accounting rules prescribe transformations (depreciation,

amortization,

etc.) of the original market value data to describe the stock of assets
involved.

It is tempting, and I think even usual among economists, to

attribute to the accounting measure of net worth (appropriately
corrected to some sort of replacement cost basis) the status of a kind

18

of "permanent income" measure, a stationary point in the noisy world of

asset revaluations. I am not aware, however, of any empirical evidence
in support of this characterization of accounting net worth in relation
to the valuation of firms (nor of the related characterization of
accounting depreciation)

There are really two reasons we should expect accounting values to

differ from market values of firms. First, accounting practices clearly
lay no claim to tracking the market values of those assets that are

carried on the books. Thus, for example, the depreciated accounting
value of fixed investment neither is, nor claims to be, a stand-in for

market value for the assets involved.9 Intangible assets acquired by
purchase are generally amortized according to formula.1° Depreciation
or amortization deductions or retirements from the stock of assets,
based on the amounts paid for the assets, are needed to account for the
fact that some systematic effect can be expected with the passage of

time. These allowances are, to be sure, based on experience with the
physical or otherwise determined useful lives of similar assets in the
past, but to serve their purpose they must be formally prescribed in

accounting rules. They do not refer to assessments of current market
value in the context of the firm, which may deviate up or down from the
path implied by accounting rules of thumb.

8 See 'eaver and Ryan (1985).
See Gibson and Frishkoff (1986, p. 44).

10 See Gibson and Frishkoff (1986, p. 46).

19

Second, important intangible assets created by the activities of a
firm (i.e., not bought from another firm), are typically not carried on

the balance sheet at all. As is well known, research and development
and advertising outlays are expensed currently. Successful efforts do
not generate assets on the books unless there is an actual transaction,

such as a sale of patent rights. The value of a firm that discovered
the laser or the transistor and could appropriate the resulting value

would surely jump in market value. Its accounting net worth, however,

would not change. The same is true for an economy under NIPA capital

accounting practices. Since the inventor of a new idea may have
difficulty capturing the rents, there is a better basis for excluding
the value increase from company books than for excluding it from a

national aggregation. Technological and market surprises of many kinds
(oil price shocks, technological breakthroughs, discovery

of a new oil

field) are excluded from company books and from NIPA income and capital

accounts. Observation of the histories of firms such as computer,
automobile, and pharmaceutical companies make clear that large movements
in value are associated with the success or failure of ideas (including

marketing) and organizational innovations. Such value changes are
clearly of great quantitative significance, quite

stochastic, and

weakly, if at all, related to investment in fixed capital.
In short, the accounting net worth of the firm is a measure of

some of its past inputs. It represents the solution to an intractable
statistical problem: how to aggregate information about financial

20

commitments through time embodied in property of one sort or another.
It is not a shortcoming of accounting net worth that it does not

perfectly match the valuation of the firm by those making use of

accounting information. Accounting data are designed to inform, rather
than duplicate, market evaluation.11
NIPA Saving and Investment
Gross investment in the national income and product accounts is
the sum of net exports of goods and services (as emphasized by Eisner
(1989), a measure of the accumulation of claims on foreigners, not a
measure of the change in market value of net claims on foreigners),

business expenditures on fixed investment (structures, including
residential structures, and producers' durable equipment), and the

change in business inventories. If we think of gross national product
as a flow of physical goods and current services, we can think of gross
investment as the portion of that flow devoted to adding to the stock of

wealth. This may be an interesting measure; it is arguably the
appropriate horizontal axis on a marginal efficiency of investment
schedule.

(This is not the place to develop the point, but it may be

that a market value aggregate belongs in a production function for SHS

income. When a firm purchases a piece of real estate for a "revalued"
price, presumably it expects to obtain as much extra value of output as
it does when it constructs a new building for the same amount.)

11 See Foster (1986) for a survey of the accounting literature on the
information content of financial statements.

21

It is a further issue whether there is a useful aggregate, called
the capital stock, that can be sensibly employed in a production

function.12 The idea that there is such an aggregate that generates a
flow of productive services underlies the capital stock figures complied

by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Although value data provide the
starting point, like GNP itself, the capital stock is conceived of as a

physical quantity. The depreciation estimates ("capital consumption
allowances with capital consumption adjustment") in the national income
and product accounts are intended to capture the loss over time in the

current productive service flow potential embodied in the accumulation

of fixed investment. Other things equal, we might expect the profitable
investment opportunities to increase with increases in depreciation
allowances, which would signal the need for "replacement" investment.
If this model captures the essence of the flow of investment
opportunities, it is net investment, not gross, that belongs on the
horizontal axis of a marginal efficiency of investment schedule.

NIPA depreciation allowances are not intended to represent the
decline in market value of the assets in question, and would not do so
even if there were no measurement problems except under very special

assumptions about the time path of discount rates and about the way

productive capacity of the assets declines over time. (Basically, what
is required is constancy of discount rates and exponential decay of

productivity.13) The actual rules used in constructing the depreciation
allowances are rooted in studies of retirement and other measures of
physical life.14
"Economic depreciation" is defined to be the decline in market

value of a piece of equipment or a structure between the beginning and

end of the accounting period. As it happens, Hulten and Wykoff (1981)
have concluded that the U.S. Department of Commerce capital consumption
estimates are reasonably similar to the average historically experienced
economic depreciation for a subset of assets for which there is an

active second-hand market. It is difficult to know, however, how
relevant such ex post data on a subset of assets are to the forwardlooking market valuation of the bolted-down assets of business firms. A
striking implication of the data in Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2, taken
at face value, is that the NIPA capital consumption allowances for the

nonfinancial corporate sector differed sharply and unsystematically from

economic depreciation over the 1948-1987 period.15 (I take up below
some of the reasons one might not take the figures at face value.)

13 See the clear discussion in Hulten and Wykoff (1981).

14 See U.S. Department of Commerce (1987); also Musgrave (1983, January
1986, August 1986).
15

Using National Balance Sheet data, Bulow and Summers (1984) have
emphasized this point in their discussion of the failure of income tax
rules to recognize wealth changes in the form of asset revaluations.
They suggest that the ex ante depreciation allowances for tax purposes
should be increased to compensate the investor for the risk of asset
revaluations that are unrecognized by the tax rules.

23

Objections to the Use of Market Value Measures of Saving
Various objections are sometimes raised to the use

of

asset market

value data, rather than NIPA measures, in analyzing saving.

1. Asset markets are too volatile. They register paper gains and
losses, not the steady accumulation of real things.
To a degree that seems often unappreciated, the determinants of

wealth are psychological. We need only be reminded of Ponzi schemes and
tulip manias, not to mention stock market crashes, to bring home how
dependent asset values are upon beliefs about the future.

The modern

literature on the rationality of expectations and the efficiency of

pricing in asset markets has emphasized in a refined way the unpleasant
difficulty of rooting asset values in "fundamentals."
Asset valuation is also inherently dependent upon the structure of

information. I like to illustrate this dependence with the case of a
building that is destined to be destroyed by a meteor on a certain date.
As long as no one knows when and where the meteor will strike, the

building has the same value as others like it. At the moment the
astronomers make public a prediction, the building loses value (to a

degree dependent on the distance into the future of the catastrophic
event and on the confidence the public places in astronomers'

forecasts). It is clear that the owner of the structure suffers a fall
in wealth at the point the information is revealed, and presumably we

would say that "society" suffers the same fall in wealth, even though in

24

a sense nothing is changed by the knowledge that causes the loss in

value. The meteor was going to crash into the building in any case.16
An interesting intermediate case arises if the information about

the future is revealed only to the owner of the building. (The
analogous situation is not unusual -

- it

gives rise to the "lemons"

problem.) If he keeps the matter a secret and sells the structure, he
suffers no loss, nor is there any observable private or social loss
until the meteor strikes.

As the examples suggest, the market value of assets has a kind of
ephemeral quality that may, for example, lead to doubts about the
efficacy of capital markets as institutions of resource allocation.17

Unfortunately, the ephemeral quality of market assessments of value does

not alter the role implied for them in economic theory. Real risk and
uncertainty about the future are apparent facts of life, which cannot be
avoided by focussing on inputs that can be measured with relative

precision. The purpose of asset measures produced by financial
accountants is to assist in the estimation of market values. The usual
argument applies that the market price will incorporate whatever

information the accounting data contain. There is, presumptively, no

16 James Poterba has reminded me that, quite apart from discounting,
the aggregate market value of wealth may not fall by the full prior
value of the doomed building when the meteor news arrives. The
aggregate value will depend upon the general equilibrium response of all
asset prices, even if the asset in question is a tiny part of the
aggregate stock. Bradford (1978) illustrates the point.

17 See Stiglitz (1972, 1979).

money to be made by betting on accounting net worth against the
market.18

2. Asset market value changes incorporate price effects. What we
need are real saving and wealth stock concepts that are independent of
discount rates and other relative asset value changes.

Various examples suggest the importance of taking into account
price effects, especially in using wealth measures to draw conclusions

about welfare. One of the most important is the effect of changes in
the discount rate. At any moment the stock of claims to future goods
and services is heterogeneous with respect to the time and contingencies

under which the claims pay off. When the prices of future consumption
claims change, so does the value of an unchanged stock of assets.

In

his discussion of the concept of income, Hicks (1946) favored a wealth
measure that would be unchanged if the steady-state level of consumption
did not change.

The increasing site value of land that we might expect to
accompany population growth provides another example.

When the value of

all houses (including mine) increases, I may be no better off, in spite

of my higher wealth, because I have to live somewhere. A third example
is suggested by John Shoven: Discovery of a new technology that made

18 Summers (1986) has emphasized how difficult it may be to establish
the "rationality" of asset markets, i.e., to tell whether one can make
money by selling short when prices are too high by some internal
standard. But presumably those who would use NIPA saving figures rather
than asset market values are not talking about small, hardto-deteCt,
effects.

26

computers of enormous power virtually costless and instantaneously
producible would render the existing stock of computers valueless (while

we're at it, assume that all software transfers costlessly to the new
machines).

These are index number problems of the classic sort.19 A
financial accounting measure of saving appears attractive in the
particular instances because they seem to call for no change in the real

wealth measure in the face of actual changes in market value. (I have
not actually tried to sort out whether a real wealth measure would not

change in the examples.) But this is surely fortuitous. Dealing with
the index number problem requires transforming market value data, and it
is only by chance that financial accounts may sometimes give the right
answer.

The discount rate change problem is a particularly important one.

When we assess performance, it would make sense to look at both wealth

and discount rate data. There is no basis, however, for presuming that
financial accounting measures of wealth perform adequately as indices of
real wealth.

3. There are no reliable data on market value of wealth;
therefore, we have to use the NIPA saving measures.
There may be problems with existing data on market values,

although very extensive and accurate data are available on assets such

an intertemporal setting.

27

as corporate equities. The National Balance Sheet data seem to me an

underexploited resource. Furthermore, as in other contexts, an
objection such as this one should be grounds for devoting efforts to
improving the data and to establishing the adequacy of the proxies we
use if direct measurements are not at hand.

Time Series Data on Wealth at Market Value
Figures derived from the National Balance Sheets cast doubt on the
adequacy of NIPA saving measures as a proxy for changes in the market

value of assets. Table 2 shows the time series of various wealth

aggregates. The nominal dollar figures have been reduced to common
units using the implicit GNP deflator (taking the average of fourth- and
first-quarter values to approximate the year-end figure corresponding to

the balance sheet observations). The aggregate net worth of households
includes the market valuation of corporate shares and of land. The

National Balance Sheets value fixed investment owned directly (in
unincorporated businesses and in the form of owner-occupied housing and
consumer durables) at replacement cost (using the NIPA data).20

20 The figures for household net worth (sector basis) included in this
deal with an error discovered in the
paper incorporate an adjustment to
course of this work by Frederick 0. Yohn, Jr., of the flow of funds
section of the Federal Reserve Board. In the published series,
household claims on noncorporate private financial institutions have
been omitted from household net worth. I have added the "approximate
share of noncorporate companies" in the net worth of the private
financial institution sector (line 50 in the Sector Balance Sheet of
sector net
Private Financial Institutions) to the published household
worth.

28

The column titled "Government Net Worth" in Table 2 is simply the
aggregate debt of local, state, and federal governments held by the

public (of course, it is a negative number). Government debt is,
directly or indirectly, included on the asset side of household balance
sheets: to avoid double counting, the column headed "Aggregate Wealth at

Market" sums the household and government net worth to produce an

aggregate wealth measure. Notice that no attempt at all has been made
to evaluate the real asset position of goverTunents.21

The difference in aggregate wealth from one year to the next gives

us Aggregate Saving in Table 2. Given what we know about the volatility
of the stock and real property markets, we should expect significant

volatility in the wealth and saving measures, and we find it. Figure 3
displays the wealth time series graphically, and Figure 4 shows the

saving series, normalized by dividing by GNP. For comparison, as
described numerically in Table 3, Figure 4 also displays the ratio of
net national saving to GNP, derived from the national income and product

accounts. As we might expect, the market value measure is much more
variable than the NIPA measure. The measure based on the National
Balance Sheets oscillates over a range from a low of almost -15 percent

to a high of almost 25 percent of GNP. The NIPA measure drifts from a
high of 10 percent in 1949 to a low of 2 percent in 1987. The two
series are very different.

21

Boskin, Robinson, and Huber (1987) and Eisner (1986) have developed
government real asset series.

29

Fluctuations in market value are not all that accounts for the

difference between the two measures. n particular, the National
Balance Sheet concept includes the stock of consumer durables in wealth.
The National Balance Sheets include estimates of the "consolidated net
assets" of the United States, consisting of the sum of reproducible
assets (including consumer durables), land at market value, U.S. gold

and SDRs, and certain claims on foreigners.22 Subtracting government
debt and excluding land from this total and taking the difference from

year to year gives us a saving figure purged of market revaluations. It
consists mostly of reproducible assets: residential structures,
nonresidential plant and equipment, inventories, and consumer durables.
It thus differs from NIPA net national saving mainly in inclusion of
consumer durables, and, in avoiding the inclusion of market
revaluations, it is conceptually directly comparable to NIPA saving.
Indeed, the figures are taken from the Bureau of Economic Analysis

tangible wealth tabulations. To emphasize that this hybrid series is
derived from financial accounting data (although it is far from the
historical-cost book values on firms' balance sheets), I refer to it as
"'Book' less Land" in Figure 5.

(Figure 5 simply adds the new series to

Figure 4.)
22

Perhaps because it is not clear how one would allocate accounting
values, the National Balance Sheet "total consolidated net assets" of
the United States excludes U.S. holdings of foreign equities and makes
no deduction for foreign holdings of U.S. equities (other than via
direct investment). The household sector net worth does include
holdings of foreign equities. The two wealth concepts are thus not
quite parallel.

30

Although the resulting series is smoother than that of aggregate
wealth, significant differences from NIPA national saving remain.
Exploration of the reasons for the remaining differences would be a side

excursion from my principal line of argument. The evidence from the
National Balance Sheet data clearly supports the conclusion that
financial accounting saving misses significant amounts of the value
change that is revealed in asset markets.
Caveats on the National Balance Sheet Wealth Figures
Several problems with the National Balance Sheet data should be
recognized:

1. The market value of equity incorporates the capitalized value
of certain variations in tax liabilities that are not balanced by

offsetting measured asset values. An instance is the "trapped equity"
problem.23 Corporate payouts in the form of dividends are subject to
tax at the shareholder level, and shareholders ought to discount this

tax in bidding for shares. A considerable (and inconclusive) literature
now exists developing the technical ins and outs of the tax and
securities law and practice in relation to the trapped equity argument.
To the extent that dividend taxes are discounted in the price of equity,

the value of a corporation's shares will be below the market value of
the assets owned by the firm.

Another instance is the value of tax liabilities accrued by

corporations via such tax rules as accelerated depreciation. An
23

See Auerbach (1979, l983b), Bradford (1981).

31

increase in such accruals ought to lower the value of corporate
equities

24

A possible third instance is the tax consequence of changing

corporate financial structure. The tax system has set up incentives,
which have varied through time, bearing on the choice between debt and

equity. One view of the current intense leveraged buyout activity in
the United States is that it is strongly motivated by such tax
considerations, and the gradual realization of the private profit (at
the expense of public revenue) to be made by financial restructuring
accounts for some of the bidding up of equity prices.
There is, in all of these instances, a balancing asset "owned" by
the public through the public's "ownership" of the government, which we

might describe as accrued tax liability. Unfortunately, however, we
cannot observe the value of this asset in the market, and so the
empirical problem does not go away with aggregation across sectors.

2. Anticipated tax claims are also important in assessing pension
reserve assets, which are viewed as belonging to households.
Presumably, the great bulk of these claims is subject to income taxation

upon distribution. When household and government financial claims are
netted in reaching a national wealth figure, this problem goes away.

3. As Auerbach (1984) has emphasized, unfunded pension
liabilities of corporations represent unmeasured assets of the

24 Auerbach (l983a, forthcoming) and Auerbach and Hines (1987) show
that the capitalized value effects of tax law changes can be large.

32

households that are presumably offset by an effect on measured corporate

equity value in the market. This component of wealth is missed in the
National Balance Sheets.

4. Debt is carried on the National Balance Sheets at book value.
Corporate debt liabilities are thus incorrectly valued. Correcting for
inflation, of course, is relatively easy. But there is also a
divergence between book and market value in current dollars that varies

through time. Tax incentives plus simple changes in the nominal
discount rates result in such divergences. Furthermore, the leveraged
buyout wave may be responsible for a systematic divergence between book

and market valuation of debt. The large premiums paid for equity claims
in corporate takeovers are sometimes explained by the implied

expropriation of the interests of bondholders. The value of the bonds
of RJR Nabisco is said to have fallen by 20 percent as a consequence of
the successful takeover of the firm in a leveraged buyout in December
1988.

It might be thought that the misstatement of the value of bonds as
liabilities on the books of corporations would be balanced by their
misstatement as assets in the hands of the public in an aggregation

across sectors. This would be so if the aggregation were in terms of
financial accounting concepts. But our aggregation to national saving
will sum the market values of equity with the book value of debt. To
correct for this problem will require gathering data on the market value

33

of bonds. (Brainard, Shoven, and Weiss (1980) have developed such
estimates for the debt of a large population of U.S. corporations.)
5.

I have mentioned above the likelihood that some of the recent

increase in equity value has come at the expense of bondholders and of

the government (through lost tax revenues otherwise expected). Shleifer

and Summers (1987) have suggested that other stakeholders" n
corporations have also lost wealth in the wave of corporate

acquisitions. We would probably describe the wealth effects on
noncorporate, nonbondholder stakeholders as impacts on human capital;
the effects are in any case presumably not reflected in asset market
data.

6. The National Balance Sheets present no estimates of the market
value of businesses owned directly by households. The data in Table 1
show a large and variable divergence between book and market values of

property owned by corporations. There is no obvious reason there should
not be a similar degree of divergence in the valuation of non-corporate
firms.

7. The Flow of Funds staff expresses reservations about the
adequacy of the estimated market value of land, which is built up using
ratios of assessed to market values from real estate tax administration

reported in five-yearly censuses of governments. I have no independent
basis for evaluating these reservations. (Corporate holdings are
presumably captured in equity values, but corporations own a small
fraction of U.S. land.)

34

The Savin2 Performance of the United States
It is usual to assess aggregate saving behavior by reference to

saving "rates," ratios of saving to aggregate income. Although dividing
the aggregate saving by a national income measure is a natural method of

normalizing for the size of the economy, one should be cautious in
drawing conclusions about economic performance from trends in, or

comparisons across countries of, such ratios. Savings rates thus
defined do not obviously relate to the objective of assessing the level
of aggregate consumption against a standard either of consistency with

past behavior or of prudence with respect to future welfare. For these
purposes, measures of wealth per capita are called for, or, more
generally, measures of the wealth of various subgroups in the
population.25
Table 4 displays wealth per capita data for the United States,
where wealth is interpreted in the National Balance Sheet sense of

household net worth (at market value) minus government debt. Saving per
capita is simply the first difference of wealth per capita, and thus

incorporates population growth. Figure 6 displays the saving series
expressed as the year-to-year growth of wealth per capita ("Growth in

Wealth per Capita" in Table 4). Because wealth is a stochastic
variable, a particular year's experience conveys limited information.

25

Kotlikoff (1984, 1986, 1988) has emphasized a similar point with
respect to assessment of the national debt.

35

It is not clear what one should regard as either a normal or a

ugood rate of increase in wealth per capita. If productivity were
stationary we would probably expect wealth per capita to be constant,
and welfare considerations would also presumably prescribe constancy.
In general, both predicted and optimal accumulation would be related to

technological progress and demographic structure. As shown in Figure 6,
there appears to be a long-term declining trend to the rate of growth of

real wealth per capita. Interestingly, the performance of the most
recent three years is on or slightly above trend.

For those looking for good news (bearing in mind the caveats
mentioned above about the use of wealth as a measure of welfare), Figure

7 displays the trend in real wealth per capita. The picture shows that,
on average, since 1948 U.S. residents have been adding to the stock of

wealth per capita about $700 (1987 price level) per year. According

to

Figure 7, the current level of wealth per capita is just a bit above its
long-term trend.

Conclusion
Although the NIPA saving measures, and especially NIPA saving
rates, are widely used in both scholarly and journalistic treatments,
their shortcomings as representations of the saving concepts derived
from economic analysis should not be controversial among economists.

Saving is the change in a stock of wealth. NIPA saving describes the
change in a cost-based measure of some past resource commitments.

Households, individually and in the aggregate, measure their situations

36

instead by reference to a forward-looking assessment of the success or

failure of those and other resource commitments. These assessments find

expression in the capital markets valuation of enterprises, broadly

conceived. The annual

change

in that value is the measure of saving.

Whatever their usefulness as measures of a certain class of
inputs, the NIPA saving and wealth measures are not good proxies for the

market-expressed assessments of results. The National Balance Sheets
present the conceptually appropriate measures of national wealth and

saving. It is clear, though, that much needs to be done to improve the
quality of the statistics and to refine their interpretation.
