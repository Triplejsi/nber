THE DEMAND FOR LOTTERY PRODUCTS

A$S TRACT

Lotteries constitute one of the fastest-growing catagories of consumer
expenditure in the United States. Not only have an increasing number of
states legalized state lotteries, but the per capita expenditures on
lotteries in lottery states have increased at an annual rate of 13 percent
after inflation between 1975 and 1988. This article examines the demand for
lottery products. A majority of the adult public in lottery states play in
any one year, but relatively few of these players account for most of the
action". Socioeconomic patterns of play, measured from both sales data and
household surveys, offer some surprises -- for example, that the Engle curve
of lottery expenditures decline with income. There is some evidence that
lottery sales increase with the payout rate, although it is not clear that it
would be profitable for the states to increase payout rates. The addition of
a new game, such as lotto, does not undercut sales of existing games, and the
oft-heard claim that interest (and sales) will "inevitably" decline is
contradicted by the data. The organizational form of the lottery is evolving
in response to the quest for higher revenues: in particular, smaller states
are forming multistate game. This article is a chapter from Selling Hope:
State Lotteries in America, an NBER monograph to be published by Harvard
University Press in November, 1989.

of lottery marketing is whether lottery purchases constitute

But there are good reasons other than the mercantile interests of

marketing to examine the demand for lottery products. One is the pragmatic

concern of states that may be considering whether or not to adopt a lottery:
how much revenue can a state expect to collect from a lottery? Another

application for the

is

in assessing the

distributional incidence of the revenue burden of lotteries. As we discuss in

Chapter

11, lotteries levy an implicit tax on players, and the incidence of

that implicit tax corresponds to the distribution of lottery expenditures.

In this chapter we explore the diversity of lottery participation. We
first develop a picture of high concentration in the context of broad

participation. Then we demonstrate that some population groups play more
often than others on the average. Of special concern is whether minorities
and low—income groups are especially active in lottery play. Finally we
examine the variables associated with high levels of lottery expenditures and

analyze

In 1986 the average

But

the $2

lottery play is concentrated among a relatively small fraction of the public
who spend much more than that. In this respect the lottery is like most other
cormrKx3ities.

First of all, not everyone plays the lottery. In any

given

only about one—third of all adults play; over the course of a year

participation broadens to encompass one—half or more of the adult public.

depend on the time interval under consideration. Measures of concentration

are

virtually identical for three surveys that asked respondents to report

lottery expenditures for some period preceding the interview: a one—week
period (Maryland, 1984), a two—month period (California, 1985), and a twelve—
month period (all lottery states combined, 1974).
The distribution for the California survey is depicted in Figure 6.1,

which illustrates the importance of heavy players in determining total lottery

sales. Half

only about one—seventh of the total handle. The top 10 percent

How does the distribution of lottery play compare with the distribution

of expenditures for other commodities? Cne rule of thumb of marketing, the
"law of the heavy half," holds that the top 20 percent of consumers of any

commodity account for 80 percent of total purchases.1 If this is indeed

account for only 65 percent of lottery play. Still, the qualitative
is the same: a relatively small minority of all consumers are

for the bulk of total expenditures.

While expenditures on lotteries are somewhat less concentrated than this
"law"

would suggest, expenditures on other sorts of coninercial gambling are

more concentrated. A survey conducted by the University of Michigan Survey

most complete available account of self—reported gambling

in the

United States. Thirty percent of the national sample reported having
participated

in some form of commercial gambling, legal or illegal, in 1974

(not including state lotteries). The top 20 percent of these players (about 6
percent of the sample) accounted for fully 93 percent of the total reported

have considerably broader participation, and less concentration of

however, one form of illegal gambling whose distribution of play appears to

A corrudity that has much in common with

is alcohol, and it is illuminating to compare

special

legal controls and have

been

broadly

condemned in religious teachings.

The dominant modern view is that moderate indulgence in either of these
activities is acceptable, but the potential exists for excess and abuse and

must be curtailed through special regulations. The distribution of alcohol
consumption reflects both the moderate nature of "normal" drinking, and the

potential for trouble. Most adults in the United States abstain (33 percent)
or drink moderately. The top 10 percent of drinkers average about ten drinks
each

day, and

account for about half of

total alcohol consumption.3 Thus, the

degree of concentration of drinking is much

one lottery marketing consultant has disputed

comon belief that lottery demand is based on impulse buying.4

On the

contrary, he says, for many lottery players — especially the big spenders ——
purchases are planned and are made regularly. Upon such distinctions depend
crucial choices about how best to market the product. Finally, from the

perspective of lottery critics, the heavy players are the ones at greatest
risk from the hazards associated with gambling: the feeding of self—
destructive compulsion and the temptation to neglect other financial
obligations for the sake of pursuing the dream of wealth.
The concentration of lottery play is also of interest because of its

effect on public perceptions. The typical lottery player may quite

as someone who spends a few dollars a week or less. For this player

the lottery is surely a harmless diversion. What is not so easily understood
from casual observation is that the typical player is not the source of the
typical revenue dollar.

Who Plays?
The focus here is on the readily observable characteristics of
individuals and groups; age, gender, race, income, place of residence,

out, several socioeconomic

are highly correlated with lottery play, but income is not one

of them.
At least three measures of lottery involvement may be used to measure the

play of a given population group. The first is the participation rate: the
percentage of group members who bought at least one lottery ticket during a

given period of time. Second is the

average expenditure by members

of the

group — the total expenditure over some period of time divided by the number
of people belonging to the group.

Third is the prevalence of heavy players

within the group: the percentage of group members who spent a relatively
large amount over the specified time period. In practice

are

these three measures

closely related, in the sense that groups that rank relatively high on one

measure are also high on the

other two.

For example, dividing the adult

into four groups by educational level, we find that

the group with the highest average expenditure (those who did not complete
high school) is also the group with the highest participation rate and the
highest concentration of heavy players.. While it is logically possible that
certain groups might attain a high average expenditure level despite a low
participation rate (that is, if those who did participate were all heavy
players), this possibility is not observed in practice.
We obtained information on the characteristics of players from a number

of different sources. Most important were household surveys from Arizona,

California,

Maryland, and the nation at large that included questions

6

about

participation in state lotteries. We also have used information based on
household surveys taken in Massachusetts and

and a national

for

California and

Maryland.5 In

analyzing who

plays

it is informative to begin by examining simple two—way

classifications that compare the rates of play for members of various

demographic groups. We have also analyzed these data using multivariate
analysis techniques that control for the effects of other characteristics, but
in general we have found that the simple tabulations give a good qualitative
picture of the patterns of lottery play.

Differences by Socioeconomic Group
Figure 6.2 compares the rates of lottery play among various population
groups based on a survey taken in California in 1986, at

a time when only

instant games were available in that state. For each group the figure shows

The pattern of lottery participation by age is an inverted U, with

than the broad middle range. Hevy play is most prevalent in the middle

years as well. Interestingly, this pattern is a departure from the age
profile of gambling in general, which shows the highest rates of gambling
among young adults and a steady decline in participation with age.

Religion. In lottery play as with gambling in general, the biggest
religious difference is the markedly higher rates of participation among

Catholics. Previous surveys of gambling have shown that participation rates
for

Catholics are half again as large

as those of Protestants, and the

Education. Anytime a lottery critic calls the lottery a "sucker bet" or

decries

the exploitation of uninformed citizens the role of education in

lottery

play is being questioned. Indeed there

is no more clear—cut

with lottery participation: lottery play falls with formal
education. Figure 6.2 shows that the proportion of adults who participate

from 49 percent for those with less

than a high school education to 30

percent

for those with a college degree. Yet this clear association cdntrasts

sharply

with

that for gambling in general. In national surveys conducted in

gambling was shown to increase with education.

Whatever the

of education in the ability of players to assess objective aspects of
betting, it is clear that lotteries appeal to a less well—educated clientele
role

than

most other forms of gambling.

Occupation and employment status. Another way to gain a
8

picture of who

plays lotteries is to examine how

play breaks

down

by oc:uation and

employment. Among six broad occupational categories in the California survey

lottery

play was most common among laborers

(including both

skilled and

unskilled), with a participation rate of 46 percent. Right behind are service
and protective and clerical workers. Among the occupations showing the lowest
rates of play were advanced professionals, although even among them the

participation rate was over 25 percent. Retired people and students played

the least.
Race and ethnic group. Racial and ethnic classifications are, of course,

loaded

with

social and

political significance in almost any context, for

better or worse. In the case of lotteries the social significance is enhanced
by the history of the daily numbers game.

providing a source of cheap entertainment, employing hundreds of residents as

and ultimately becoming a fixture of the cultural

landscape.7

Although the evidence is somewhat mixed, it appears that in the United

States blacks and Hispanics play more than non—Hispanic whites. Figurç 6.2
shows that in California Hispanics played considerably more than other whites
but that the rates of play for blacks was similar to that for non—Hispanic

whites. Betting at least $5 per week was twice as conn for Hispanic adults
as for others. Similarly, a survey taken in Arizona showed a higher rate of
play for Hispanics than other whites. while only 9 percent of other whites in
that state reported playing the lottery at least once a week, the rate for

9

Hispardcs was 28 percent.8 The available survey material in the East sgests
that blacks play more than whites in that region.9

Calculations

based on a

survey taken in Maryland in 1986 reveal that some 43 percent of whites had
played the lottery within the previous ITonth, but among blacks the comparable

figure was 68 percent. The size of this racial difference depends on the type

of lottery game, and

is

largest for the legal version of the nuribers game.

lottery play, one must ask whether differences such as these can be explained

by other observable differences. We turn to this question in considering the
last of the demographic variables to be discussed.

Income. The relationship between income and lottery expenditures is of
particular

interest owing to the frequent charge that lotteries are played

disproportionately by the poor.

In

fact there has been

more

research on this

question than on almost any other related to lotteries. The preponderance of
the

evidence

suggests that there is little systematic relationship between

income and the amount

spent on lottery play.

Absolute

expenditures

appear

to

be remarkably uniform over a broad range of incomes. This uniformity is
noteworthy since spending, say, $10 per week on the lottery represents a much
greater financial corruiitment for a household with an income of $10,000 per

year than for one earning $40,000 per

Using data for Maryland and Massachusetts we

found that,

with one exception,

the estimated average level of expenditures bore no consistent relationship
with

the average income by zip codes. The exception was lotto games with

comparatively large jackpots, for which expenditures tended to rise with
income.

Of the various data sets we analyzed there was just one showing the
poorest

respondents playing more than others. A 1984 Gallup

Maryland

survey in

(see Table 6.2) found that respondents with incomes below $15,000

(about 15 percent of the

sample) played more than those with higher incomes ——

indeed more than twice as much. Whether this difference is valid or an
artifact of the special difficulties involved in surveying poor neighborhoods

is not clear. The less error—prone data on winners by zip codes, found in

among games, with lotto having a relatively strong appeal to upper income

examine the independent effects of race, education, and other individual
characteristics, we estimated multivariate equations explaining average weekly
expenditures

based on the survey of Maryland residents. Largest and

statistically most significant among the explanatory variables is race, with
blacks spending an average of about $4.50 more than whites, other
characteristics being the same. This racial difference is so large in this
data set that we estimated separate equations for blacks and whites. (The
estimated equations are given in Table 6.2). Lottery expenditures for whites

and blacks alike tend to fall with education. This effect is significant only
for whites, with the difference between college graduates and those who did

not complete high school being almost $5 per

week. A

similar pattern with

smaller differences is observed for blacks, but owing to the small sample the

coefficients are estimated very imprecisely. Regarding age, the estimates

the much higher rate of lottery play by residents of

These differences are dramatic and strongly stgest that the introduction
of a state lottery brings a large fraction of the adult population into

commercial gambling. To confirm this conclusion it must be demonstrated that
the observed differences in commercial gambling are not the result of other
differences between residents of lottery and norilottery states. Hence, we
conducted a multivariate statistical analysis (probit) of participation in
commercial gambling for the entire sample, which included variables for sex,
race,

religion, frequency of church attendance, household income, age,

education, the size of the respondent's city of residence, and whether or not

the respondent lived in the South. Controlling for all of these variables, we
found that the likelihood of participation in commercial gambling was still

example, a person with the socioeconomic characteristics associated with a

participation probability of 27 percent if living in a non—lottery state had a

participation probability of 52 percent in a lottery state. Thus we conclude
with considerable confidence that the lottery is a powerful recruiting device,
which in 1974 was responsible for inducing about one—quarter of the adult
population, who sould not otherwise have

14

done so, to participate in comercial

gambling.
The

national data do confirm, however, that people who participate in

other forms of comercial gambling are more likely than average to plv the

lottery, if given the opportunity. Indeed for respondents from lottery
states, lottery participation was twice as high among gamblers as among those
who did not participate in other commercial gambling (74 percent as opposed to
36 percent). We can

up these results this way: the lottery has an

especially strong appeal to established gamblers, but it also creates new
ones.
One

indication

from the "Gambling in the

United States" survey is that

most commercial gamblers do not specialize in a single type of gambling. Even

within the confines of the lottery many players will regularly buy tickets for
two or more types of games. To demonstrate the overlap in play among various
lottery products we report findings from surveys in Massachusetts and New

Jersey. Lotto is very popular in Massachusetts, and, according to one survey
commissioned by the state lottery agency, almost everyone who bought lottery

tickets

played lotto. Overall, 62 percent of adults played at least one game.

About half of these played lotto exclusively, and the remainder played lotto
in

combination with one or both of the other games (numbers and instant

games). As might be expected, those who play more than one game usually bet

more than those who dabble in only one. For example, those who play only

NSG study.

In general, those who play the lottery are more likely than

average to bet on bingo or horse races. And, according to this survey,
lottery players are much less likely than average to use cents—off coupons in
stores, whereas they are more likely than average to participate in giveaway
games.

Between the

prudent coupon—clipper and the let's—take—a--chance

sweepstakes player, there is little doubt who will be in line to buy lottery
tickets.

Conclusion
The socioeconomic variables by which social scientists classify people ——

sex, race, age, religious background, education, income, profession —— provide
a useful framework in which to understand observed patterns in lottery play.
But even when such readily observed characteristics are accounted for, there

remains considerable diversity. Ultimately the question of personality
enters: some people simply find gambling a more engaging activity than others.
When the state introduces a lottery, residents who are already betting on the
horses or bingo or the illegal numbers game

tend

to become regular customers.

But the lottery also finds a large following among the majority who had not
previously been spending money on comercial gaines and whose taste for
gambling needed the stimulus of the lottery in order to be awakened.
Of course whether and how much someone plays the lottery is not simply a

function of circumstances and tastes. Also important is the nature and
quality of the products being offered by the lottery. In the next sections we
consider the determinants of lottery sales which are under the control of the

from Massachusetts, Maryland, and other states whose lotteries have been sales
leaders?

We have described the socioeconomic patterns of lottery participation.
Much of the interstate variation in lottery sales is the result of differences
in these factors, which are determinants of the gambling propensity of the

resident population. For example, 84 percent of Massachsetts residents live
in urban areas, compared with only 34 percent of Vermont residents. In
Massachusetts sales also are enhanced in comparison with Vermont by the
relatively high percentage of residents who are Roman Catholics and/or members
of ethnic groups in which participation in coiwnercial gambling has

traditionally been high. Such factors help explain the large interstate
disparities in sales,16 but this sort of explanation is not very helpful to

the lottery manager seeking to increase sales. Presumably this manager is not
in a position to proselytize for the Catholic church or encourage rural
residents to move to the city.
A number of actions that are available to lottery managers are

potentially effective in stimulating sales. First, expanding the product line
by introducing a new game will increase total sales. Second, increasing the
payout rate on existing games

will

probably increase sales, and a carefully

17

considered restructuring of the prize offerings may also help in this respect.
Third, for the game of lotto an increase in the population base (through
joining a consortium of states) will increase sales by making it possible to
offer larger jackpots.

Expanding the Product Line

The typical pattern for lotteries which began operating in the 1980s was
to get started with the instant game and then introduce one of the on—line
games (nuithers or lotto) several months or even years later, with the other

following after an additional interval. There is a natural concern that
introducing a new game will detract from sales of existing games ——

for

example, that given a chance, players may redirect some of their instant game

expenditures to playing lotto. If this were to happen, then the increase in

overall lottery sales uld be somewhat less than the sales of the new game.
In technical terms the concern is that the several types of lottery games are
substitutes for one another, just as are, say, different brands of cigarettes.
This concern is plausible, especially since most lottery participants play
more than one game, given the opportunity. But the evidence very clearly

would increase net revenues to the state treasury, and available

on this sject is not especially persuasive one way or the other.

The basic issue

here is analagous to the attention paid

in the field of

public finance to the relationship between a tax rate and the aimunt of tax

revenue collected. During the early years of the Reagan administration the
economist Arthur Laffer became famous for his claim that lowering the
federal income tax rates would increase

the

federal revenues. In the case of

lottery the analagous assertion is that an increase in the payout rate

would increase sales by so much that net revenues would increase, despite
the reduction in net revenue per dollar of sales.
It would be surprising indeed if an increase in the payout rate did not

increase sales somewhat. Given a higher payout rate,

the lottery game

designers could increase the lotto jackpet or the numbers prize, thus

enhancing the appeal. Alternatively, designers could increase the nunber or
size of small prizes in lotto or instant games, thus giving more players the

experience of being winners and encouraging them to continue playing. In
short, a larger payout rate would give the designers new options for creating
attractive prize offerings, which would in turn generate increased action from
players whether they evaluated a game on the basis of actuarial science or on
instinct.

instant game.

The

result is that an increase in the payout rate will

increase sales. But the question remains whether the Increase would be

sufficient to increase net revenue to the state2°
This question cannot be answered from the available data. For example,
take the case of the nuuiers game. As of 1986 every state but one offered a
payout rate of 50 percent. The exception was Massachusetts, with a payout
rate

of 60 percent.

It is true that Massachusetts' per capita sales were

relatively high: 36 percent higher than

difference

Connecticut's, for instance, and the

was greater still compared with other neighboring states. &it

Massachusetts also has much higher instant game and lotto sales per capita
than its neighbors, and for those games its payout rate is no different from

theirs. It is thus not feasible to infer what proportion of Massachusetts'
nunbers sales are due to its high payout rate.21

The game of lotto offers slightly more interstate variation in payout

rates. In fiscal 1986 nineteen

states offered lotto. While most of these had

a payout rate of 50 percent, five had lower payout rates. A regression
analysis of sales data for lotto did yield a coefficient estimate

significantly greater than zero for one specification. Indeed, the point
estimate was large enough to suggest that an increase in payout would increase
net revenue, although the coefficient was estimated imprecisely enough to

leave considerable statistical doubt about this conclusion. Other variables
included in this specification were population, per capita income, and percent
urban (all positive and significant) and percent black (small and

21

insignificant). Other specifications yielded smaller coefficient estimates on

payout rate.22 Given
nurrber

the

multitude of plausible specifications and the nall

of observations, this approach does not yield confidence—inspiring

estimates. 23

From the point of view of a lottery agency, increasing the payout rate is
an expensive tactic for stimulating sales. (For example, the unit cost of
increasing the payout rate by 2 percentage points

doubling the

advertising budget

is equivalent to more

than

in most states.) While it seems likely that

the tactic would be effective in increasing sales somewhat, it is not clear
that sales are sufficiently responsive to the payout rate that net revenues

would increase. At the level of payout rates currently being offered, an
increase in the rate would produce an increase in net revenues only if sales
were increased by more than 2 percent for each percentage point hike in the
payout rate.24

In particular, increasing the payout

rate from 50 percent to

60 percent would increase net revenues only if sales increased by more than 30
percent

as a result.25 Given currently available evidence, there is no

persuasive basis

for predicting whether that much of an increase would be

likely to occur.

Modifying the Prize Structure

Most players do not care about the payout rate per se; indeed, very few
lottery participants even know the payout rate of the games they

concerned about the prizes offered by a game, and presumably

players focus on different aspects of the prize structure ——

the

likelihood of winning some prize, or the size of the top prize, or the

likelihood of winning a prize that is above some minimum magnitude. While
players may not have an accurate impression of the prize structure, they can
form some sort of impression from personal experience (and the experience of

22

their acquaintances) in playing the game and from advertising and promotional

material. The primary objective in designing a prize structure for a game is
to create as favorable an impression on the market as possible within the
financial

limits of the game. The

would allow changes that would make

prize structure more attractive to at least some potential players. Put

another way, the success of a game

depends

not just on its payout rate but to

a large extent on how the payout is structured into prizes.26
This point is illustrated with a case study from Ohio. In Noveither 1987
the Ohio lottery introduced a new instant game, Holiday Cash, with an
unprecedented payout rate of 75 percent, compared with the normal 50 percent.
Holiday Cash sales averaged about $4 million per week during the first month,
which was about double the sales rate for the two previous instant games

introduced by the Ohio lottery. At first glance this appears to be evidence
that sales are highly sensitive to an increase in the payout rate. Subsequent
history casts doubt on that interpretation, however, since the two games
introduced after Holiday Cash enjoyed sales just as high, despite the fact
that

these games offered the traditional 50 percent payout rate. Why did

sales persist at the new level after the payout rate reverted to the old
level? One possible explanation is that Holiday Cash introduced a new, prize
structure along with the high payout rate. The new structure eliminated
prizes above $1,000 and increased

(discussed in Chapter 5), it is

perhaps not surprising that designing

structures that will maximize public appeal remains more a matter of

trial and error than science.

Increasing the Population Base
For the game of lotto bigger is better.

Small states are unable to

mount a lotto game that attracts much public interest because the jackpots
are inevitably small compared to the multimillion-dollar bonanzas generated

in California and New York. As a result, multistate lottery consortiums
have formed in order to offer a lotto game that, by coirbining the

populations of several small states, rivals the games of the largest states.

The first such consortium was the Tn—State (Maine, New Hampshire, and
Vermont). The second was LottoAmerica, initiated in 1988, including the

24

District of Colu,bia and five widely scattered states with a coriine
population of about 12 million. The states in both of these consortiums have
enjoyed a considerable jump in lotto sales since jol ing together.
Explaining the peculiar economies of scale for lotto requires more than a
sentence

or two.

about 25 percent). If there is no jackpot winner in

that jackpot rolls over into the jackpot for the

next

drawing, as described in Chapter 4. When several players win, the jackpot is

divided among them. The explanation of why

the

population base is important

to lotto sales but not sales of other lottery games hinges on the role of the

jackpot in attracting lotto action.28 An example may help explain how this
works.

Suppose state A has an adult population of 10 million and state B has

only 100,000. Given equally attractive games, we assume that lotto purchases
in both states will average $1 per capita at each drawing. In state A the
initial jackpot is then worth $2.5 million,

compared with only $25,000 in

state B. If both states set the probability of winning at 1 in 100,000, then
there will be an average of one hundred winners in state A and one winner in

state B, with the average prize per winner the same in both states. Given
these rules, the games in

the two

states do not appear to differ much.

these rules, which state has the more attractive lotto game?

compared with state B, state A offers one hundred times the jackpot but a

much lower probability of winning — 1 percent of state B's probability. For
reasons discussed in Chapter 5, most players prefer state A's game to state

B's. The prize in state A is the stuff that dreams are made of, and in case

Decline in Interest

The conventional wisdom regarding lotteries is that after they have
been

around for a while, the public loses interest.30 Maintaining sales

requires the introduction of new games or new versions of old games. As

in

experience through the looking glass, it is necessary for the
lottery agencies to run very fast just to hold their ground. In the words

of one observer: "Two considerations motivate the constant search for
new ways to dress up the lotteries' ancient arithmetic. The first is the hope

that

a new conbination of price, prize, and gimmick will attract new players.

the mid—l98 experienced a surge of interest when first introduced, which

dissipated quickly. California sold over $120 million in instant game tickets
during its first week of operation but by the end of a year was down to about
$20 million per week. After this honeymoon period is over, however, the

pattern is not one of further decay, as is stgested by the statement just
quoted, but rather of more or less steady growth. The introduction of a new
game, notably

of

lotto, creates a surge in total sales, but even

Conclusion
Lottery managers are very much concerned with increasing their "profits,"
the net revenue that remains after prizes and other costs of doing business

are paid. In most circumstances achieving growth in profits requires
increasing sales. Recent experience indicates two methods that have enjoyed
universal success——adding lotto to the product line and (for smaller states)
joining

a consortium of states to expand the population base for lotto games.

One cannot be so confident about the effects of

27

changing the prize structure

of an existing game or changing the payout rate.
The state agencies have been remarkably timid about experimenting with

payout rates. Their reluctance to increase payout rates may result from the
fact that this is a costly strategy for increasing sales on a per unit basis.

nd while

it is certainly to be expected that increasing the

game from, say, 50 to

60

payout rate

on a

evidence that it would stimulate sales enough (more than 30 percent) to

revenues. Perhaps if the competition siere to increase among
states for cross—border sales, the standard 50 percent payout would no longer

mechanisms are described in Chapter 10.

Finally, the various methods for increasing sales may also influence the

distribution

of sales across different population groups. Introducing or

expanding the game of lotto brings in more middle class players, just as the
nunters game brought in more minority players. The lottery has a vast

the detailed choices of the lottery agencies.

example, in fiscal 1986 most of the interstate differences in per
capita nunbers sales could be explained by the percentage of blacks in the

population. The correlation between the logarithms of these t variables
(per capita

sales

and percent black), is .87 for the sixteen numbers games

operating that year.
17The states are Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio,
Pennsylvania,

and

Vermont.

18The data are for the period from July 18, 1984, to March 8, 1986. Each

of

the 170 observations consists of the sum of three days' numbers sales, in

thousands of dollars (NtJM), corresponding in each case to the three—day period

between lotto drawings. The regression ecuation included a time trend (T), a
dumy variable for the second half of the week (SAT), and a variable giVing
the amount of rollover included in the lotto jackpot (R), equal to zero if
there was a winner in the previous drawing, otherwise the amount advertised as
the official jackpot for the preceding drawing, measured in thousands of

dollars. The estimated equation (with standard errors in parentheses) was:
N(JM =

2797 (21) — 0.0018 (.0038) R + 332 (18) SAT + 4.34 (0.19) T, R—squared =

21A series of cross section regressions of m.mthers sales was run

to

estimate the effect of payout rate. rising fiscal 1986 data for the fifteen
states that were offering a nuithers game at that time, we found that the
coefficient estimate on the payout rate in no case exceeded its standard

error. A total of seven (log linear) specifications were tried, using
various corrbinations of the following set of variables: percent black,
population,

per capita income, and percent urban. The only variable that was

statistically different from zero by normal standards was percent black. Its
coefficient implied an elasticity of about .7. This result is given in Table

strategy is to estimate separate

regressions for sales of each game rather than a single equation on total

sales. This is what we have done for numbers and

in Table A.4. This

disaggregated approach provides the basis for estimating the distinct patterns

associated with each game, rather than averaging them together. Most
important, separate equations avoid the problem that an overall payout rate is
a sort of price average with different weights in each state and is hence
endogenous to the pattern of sales.

$5, a payout rate

of 50 perCent, and commissions

and additional administrative

costs amounting to six cents per dollar. After s.btracting prizes of $50 and

operating costs of $11, net revenue would be $39. Ould the lottery increase
its revenues by increasing its payout rate

to 60 percent? It could if sales

rose at least 30 percent, to $130. Then deducting prizes of $78 (60 percent
of $130), the fixed cost of $5, and other costs of $7.80, net revenues would be
$39. 20.

time. The specifications included different subsets of the following
variables: income per capita, percent black, percent urban, and payout rate.
The state population was included in every specification, and was highly

statistically significant in each case. The point estimate implies that a

capita.

320ne impediment to this sort of competition is the federal prohibition

on using the mail to ship lottery materials. As of 1988 that restriction was
being circumvented through the use of other shippers, telephone orders, and

illegal couriers. But these methods are somewhat costly and inconvenient to

players. If federal restrictions were eliminated, a true national market in
lottery tickets would emetge, with profound effects on game design and sales

patterns.
