STOCK VOLATILITY AND THE CRASH OF '87

ABSTRACT

This

paper analyzes the behas br of stock return volatility using daily data from 1885 through

1987. The October 1987 stock market crash was unusual in many ways

relative

to prior history. In

particular, stock volatility jumped dramaticallyduring and after the crash, but it returned to lower.
more normal levels quickly.

I

use data on implied volatilitiesfrom call option prices and estimates

of volatility from futures contracts on stock indexes to confirm this result.

Stock Volatility and the Crash of '87

C. William Schwert

I,

Introduction
On October 19, 1987, the Standard

or 20.4 percent.

&

Poor's composite portfolio fell from 282.70 to 224.84,

This is the largest one day drop in the history of major stock market indexes from

February 1885 through the end of 1988. Followingthis drop, daily stockprices rose and fell by large
amounts during the next several weeks. Thus, the fall in stock prices was followedby a large increase
in stock volatility.
This paper documentsthe behaviorof daily stock returns before, during and after the October
1987 crash.

It compares and contrasts the 1987 crash with previous crashes.

It also analyzes

the

behavior of prices for options on stock market portfolios and for futures contracts on the S&P 500,
These contingent claims contracts reinforce the conclusion that stock market volatility returned to
lower, more normal levels quickly following the 1987 crash. This is unusual relative to the evidence

from previous crashes.
Section 2 summarizes some of the literature on time-varying stock volatility. Section
contains estimates

of the conditional standard deviations of daily stock returns from

3

1885-1987. It

shows that stock volatility was unusually high during the 1929-1934 and 1937-1938depressions, and

during the 1973-1974 OPEC recession. Section 4 comparesthe estimates of daily stock volatility from
the stock, options and futures markets during 1987- 1988. Section 5 summarizesthe empirical results

and relates these findings to the October 1987 stock market crash.
2. Review

of Previous Research

Officer
as

{1973J shows

that aggregate stock volatility increased during the Great Depression,

did the volatility of money growth and industrial production. He also shows that stock volatilits

was at similar levels before the Depression as after. So it is difficult to credit the creation of the

Securitiesand Exchange Commission (S.E.C.) with the reduction in stockvolatility that occurred after
1939. Benston [1973] shows that the volatility of individual stocks, and particularly, the part

of

volatility that is unrelated to general market movementt.did not decrease until well after the S.E.C.
began itt operations in October 1934. Like Officer, Benston concludesthat the activities of the S.E.C.
cannot be credited with lowering stock volatility. Schwert [1987] analyzes the relation of stock
volatility with real and nominal macroeconomic volatility, financial leverage,stock trading activity.
default risk, and firm profitability using monthly data from 1857-1986. Schwert [1989) shows that
monthly stock volatility was higher during recessions and following the major banking crises from
1834-1986 (also

tee Wilson. Svlla

and Jones [1988]). Moreover, he shows that the Federal Reserve

Board has raised margin requirementsfollowing decreases in stock volatility during the period from
1934-1987. There is not evidence that increases in margin requirements has e been followed by

reductions in volatility. French, Schwert and Stambaugh [1987] show that stock volatility is highly
persistent, and that on average unexpectedincreases in volatility are associated with negative stock
returns. They also show there is weak evidence that expected risk premiums are positively related
to expected stock volatility.

3.1 Extreme Changes in Stock Prices

Table I lists the 50 largest increases and decreases in daily stock returns from February 16,
1885 through 1987. This sample includes 28.884 daily stock returns. From 1885 through 1927, luse

a compositeof the Dow Jones Industrial and Railroad Averages, weighted by the number of stocks
in each index (Dow Jones [1972]). From January 1928 to the present, I use the Standard & Poors
composite portfolio (90 stocks until March 1957, and 500 since that time -- see Standard & Poor's
[1986]). The Dow Jones portfolios are price-weighted, while the S&P portfolio is va1ue-weighted

neither includes dividends in the returns.1

As mentioned at the beginningof the paper, October 19, 1987, is the largest one day percent

change in stock prices (-20.4 percent) Out of the sample of 28,884 observations. The next largest
change in stock prices occurred on March 15, 1933, when stock prices rose 16.6 percent following

the Federal Banking holiday. In perusing this list several patterns emerge. First, there are many
reversals, when large drops in stock prices have been followed by large increases in stock prices. For
example, the 1929 stock market crash represents the next two largest drops in stock prices, -12.3 and
-10.2 percent on October28 and 29. But the market reboundedon October30 with the second largest
one day gain in the sample, 12.5 percent. This is characteristic of an increase in stock market

volatility; that is, an increased chance of large stock returns of indeterminate sign. In fact, 29 of the
50 most negative returns and 36 of the 50 most positive returns occur in the October 1929—July 1934

period. The September 1937-September 1939 period accounts for 7 of the most negative and 5 of the
most positive returns. The week from October 19 through 26, 1987, accounts for 2

of the

most

negative and 2 of the most positive returns. March 1907 accounts for I large and 1 small return. July
and August, 1893 contain I of the smallest and 2 of the largest returns, and May—November, 1940

of the smallest and I of the largest returns. These brief episodes in stock market history
represent 89 percent of the extreme daily returns to aggregate stock portfolios. They are each

characterized by high levels of stock market volatility!
Table 2 lists the 50 largest increases and decreases in monthlystock returns from January 1834
through the end of 1987. This represents 1,848 monthly stock returns. Schwert [19891 describes the
construction of this stock return series. Briefly, from 1834-1856 I use Smith and Cole's
portfolio of industrial and railroad stocks. From 1857-1870

2Cutter, Poterba and Summer. [1989] analyse large daily returns from 1928-87 to see whether they are related to specific
news events. They find that some, but not all of the large positive or negative returns occur at the some time as major news
stories. One reason that return volatility could increase is that the volatility of the 'informationenvironment' increase,.

Prices(CRSP) value-weighted portfolio of NYSE stocks. The latter two portfolios include dividends.
I use the dividend yields from the Cowles portfolio from 1871-1879 to estimate the yields from 18341870.

The results in Table 2 reinforce the conclusions drawn from Table 1. First, it is worth noting
that October 1987 is only the fourth lowest return in the 1834-1987 sample. The return for the
month is similar to the return on October

for the

rest

of the month net to zero.

negative and 5 of the most positive returns. One of the largest and one of the smallest returns come
from 1987. Again, a large proportion of both the largest and the smallest returns come from brief
subperiods in the overall 1834-1987 sample, This shows an increase in stock volatility during these
periods.

The models in the next section provide a more structured analysis of the time series properties

of stock market volatility.

Volatility, 1885-1987

There are several stylized facts concerning stock return volatility. First, it

periods (see Poterba and Summers [1986], Schwert

[19871 and French, Schwert and Stambaugh [1987] for alternative estimates

of

the persistence of

stock volatility). Second, stock volatility increases after stock prices fall (e.g., Black [19761, Christie
[1982], French, Schwert and Starnbaugh [19871 and Nelson [1988]). Third, stock volatility is related
to macroeconomic volatility, recessions and to banking crises (Officer [1973], Schwert [1987, 19891).
On the other hand, there are many competing parametric models to represent conditional

heteroskedasticityof stock returns! For this paper, I adopt a variation of the strategy followed by
French, Schwert and Stambaugh [1987] and by Schwert [1989]. First, stock returns are regressed on
22 lagged returns (about one month) to estimate short-term movements in conditional expected

percent per day), while the intercepts for the other days of the week are reliably positive.4 The
autoregressive coefficients are positive out to about two weeks (10 to 12 trading days), with the
largest estimate at lag I. The autocorrelation at lag I is often attributed to nonsynchronoustrading

of individual securities (Fisher [1966) and

much persistence in volatility. Saturday trading occurred from 1885

average from the close of trading on Friday (or Saturday, when there was Saturday trading) to the
close on Monday. This represents more calendar time. Both of these effects are seen by Keim and
Stambawgh [1984] using the daily S&P composite returns from 1928-1984.

a 22 period weighted average of the

for movements

showing that movements in daily stock volatility are much more predictablethan movements in stock

I have also estimated the model in equations (1) and (2) using 44 lagged returns and volatility
measures. The estimate of the return equation (1) is unaffected, in that the sum

of the incremental

22 lag coefficients is .0063 with a t—statistic of .37. On the other hand, the sum

of the

incremental

22 lag coefficients in equation (2) is .183 with a t—statistic of 6.45 (the sum for lags I through 44 is
.888). Thus, the persistence in conditional volatility is stronger than the results in Table 3 show.

Thus, there is weak

evidence that an increase in volatility increases the expected future return to stocks.

3.4 Models

for Daily Stock [olwilitv Using High-Low Spreads

Parkinsonjl980] and Garman and Klass (1980] create efficient estimators of the variance of
returns using extreme values of prices. Garman and Klass show that a variance estimator based on
the percentage (high-low) spread is

oer 5 times

as efficient as the estimator based on daily stock

returns. They note, however, that infrequent trading biases downward the extreme values estimator
and would reduce its efficiency.

Table 5a contains estimates of the return equation (5). Table Sb contains estimates of the volatility
model (6). Both equations also include a dummy variable equal to 1 from January 1980 - December
i983, and 0 after 1984. Standard & Poor's changed the way they calculate the high-low values in
January 1984. A plot of the high-low spread for the S&P portfolio compared with the spread for the
Dow Jones industrial Average over the 1980-1988 period shows that S&P spreads drop noticeably at

that time.8 The dummy variable. SPDUM, adjusts for the change in the level of measured spreads
in 1984.
The spread data do not help predict stock returns in Table

Sa.

is

spreads proxy for volatility, these coefficientsshould be positive. The estimates in Table Sa for the
1980—1987 sample are different from the estimatesfor the 1885-1987 sample in Tables 3 and 4a. For
example, while the intercept for Monday returns is negative, it is only + standard error from 0. The
autoregressivecoefficient at lag i, p = .09, is close to the value in Table 3 (.10). but the pattern of
negative coefficients after lag

the sum of the 22 lags close to 0. The coefficients on

S are larger than the estimates in Table 4a, and the sum for 22 lags is 9.6.

Nevertheless,the estimates are imprecise, so there

is only weak

evidence that expected returns are

related to past volatility.
Table Sb shows evidence that lagged spreads add significant information in predicting
volatility. The coefficient of the spread at lag I,

U,, is

almost 3 standard errors above 0. The sum

°One possibility is that 5&P used the highest and lowest prices for each stock in the portfolio during the day to create
the high/low values for the portfolio prinr In 1954. Since 1984, it seemsthat they evaluate the value of the portfolio frequently
throughout the day. The latter prncedure matches the theory behind the Parkinson estimator, and is bound to produce a
smaller measured spread.

following a large positive return, but the size

spreads reduces the predictive ability of lagged absolute residuals.

Stock Return Volatility from Table 6, 1886-1987

The number of stocks in the Dow Jones portfolio increases from 12 in 1885 to 50 by 1926.
Nevertheless, there are no obvious changes in the portfolio standard deviation in the months near
the changes. Moreover, the Dow Jones portfolio volatility is similar to the S&P portfolio volatility
in 1928. Thus, there

is

little reason to believe that the size or composition of the portfolio has

important effects on the time series behasior of volatility.10

°There is also no signifinool change in volatility when the S&P portfolio expanded from 90 to 500 stocks n March 1957

19

•:The most

notable episodes of high volatility are from 1929-1934, 1937-1938, 1946. 1973-

1974 and 1987. Officer [1973) and Schwert[1987) have documented that many macroeconomic time

series, such as the money growth rate and industrial production, were also more volatile during the
Great Depression (1929-l938). Nevertheless, as stressed by Schwert [l987J, the increase in
macroeconomic volatility is not large enough to explain all of the increase in stock market volatility

duringthis period. Schwert also shows shat changes in aggregate financial leverage following the
stock market crash of 1929 are too small to explain the sharp rise in stock volatility during the
Depression.

Thus, the plot in Figure 1 confirms the analysis of Tables 1 and 2. Episodes of high stock
volatility in the past have occurred in a few briefspans of time. The plot also confirms the analysis

of Tables

3, 4b and Sb, that volatility is persistent. Once it rises, it usually remains high for many

months. As noted by Schwert [1989), many periods

of high volatility correspond to business cycle

recessions or crises in the banking system.
4. How Unusual Was the '87 Crash?
4.1 Daily S&P returns

There are manyways to measure the extent to whichthe October 1987 crash and its aftermath
was unusual. One somewhat mechanical method is to add dummy variables to equations (3) and (4).

Two dummy variables:
087
N87

= 1,

from October 20-30, 1987, and 0 otherwise, and

1, from November2-30, 1987, and 0 otherwise,

are used to estimate the effects of the crash on returns and volatility. Table 7 contains estimates and
t—statistics for the dummy variable coefficients. The, autoregressive model

for returns predicts that

the large drop in stock prices on October 19 would persist for the next month. On the other hand,
the positive effect of lagged volatility on returns predicts higher than average returns after October
19.

The estimates in Table 7 say that stock returns were higher than predicted from October 20-30

relative to the model in equations (3) and (4). They are lower than predicted from November 2-30,

index is close to zero,

From Table 4b. the large drop in stock prices on October 19 predicts future volatility to be
much higher. The estimates of the October and Novembercoefficients for stock volatility are both
negative and several standard errors below 0. Thus, while volatility was high relative to its historical
average in the weeks after the October 1987 crash, it was below the prediction of the model for stock
returns and volatility in Tables 4a and 4b. In essence, the stock market returned to relatively normal
levels of volatility quickly at the end of 1987.
Another way to tell whether the 1987 crash was unusual is to compare

it to previous crashes,

Figure 2 plots the average absolute error from the estimate of equation (4j in Table 4b, uj, for the
10 most negative daily otock returno in Table I (excluding October 19, 1987) for 66 days (about 3

Average

This graph shows that volatility typicallydeclines after crashes, and that the October 1987 crash looks
like the average crash, except that it has a much larger value on day 0. It also seems that volatility
was lower before the October 1987 crash than for the average of the other crashes.
Figure 3 is similar to Figure 2, except that it plots the predictionsfrom equation (3) in Table
4b. There are two notable differences between the October 1987 crash and the average crash. First,
the level of predicted volatility was lower in 1987 than for the average. Second, for the five days
after October 19, predicted volatility remained above the average for the other crashes. After that.
the conditional volatility of stock returns behaved like the average for previous crashes. Relative to

Several things are clear from this graph. First, option traders' perceptions of stock volatility

did not rise until October

19, and they remained high for the next couple of months. The implied
standard deviation rose from less than .04 per month to over .09 per month on the 19. It decayed

back down to its pre-crash level by March 1988 and remained at that level throughout 1988.

4.3 Evidence front she Futures Market

Arbitrage forces the price of the S&P futures contract to mimic the index. Therefore, it is
reasonable to expect the volatility of futures prices to be similar to the volatility of stock prices.
to 50
Nevertheless, Edwards [1988] shows that the variance of daily futures returns has been 40
percent larger than the variance of S&P stock returns since 1982 when these futures began trading.15
There are several reasons why this might occur. First, variation in the expected real return, or in the
dividend yield, to the S&P portfolio could explain some of this difference (although preliminary
calculations suggest these factors are unlikely to explain the extra variation in futures returns).
Second, becsuse not all stocks in the S&P portfolio trade at the end

of the day, the

measured stock

index smooths volatility of the 'true' value of the underlying stocks (e.g., Scholes and Williams
1977]). Third, because transactionscosts are lower in futures markets, investors with macroeconomic
information are likely to trade in futures markets rather than the stock market. The extra volatility
in futures prices may reflect information that would not be worth trading on in the stock market.
to
Arbitrage between futures and stock markets would prevent large disparities between prices
persist, but it would not prevent small short-run variations. Finally, 'speculation' or 'noise tradint'

in futures markets may induce extra volatility into futures prices (e.g., Shiller [1984], Black [1986]
and Summers [1986]).
Futures prices reflect the value of the portfolio at a point in time. Thus, the intraday (highlow) futures spread is probably a better measure

trading. Thus, even though futures volatilits

larger than stock volatility, past volatility or spreads from futures may help predict stock return

5. Conclusions
The stock market crash of October 19, 1987 has already been studied under a variety

of

microscopes. This paperfocuses on the effect of the 20 percent drop in stock prices on the volatility

of stock market returns.

In particular, it analyzes whether the behavior of daily returns before and

after the 1987 crash was unusual relative to the experience of over 100 years of daily data. While the
1987 crash was the largest one day percentagechange in prices in over 28,000 observations, it was
also unusual in that stock market volatility returned to low pre-crash levels quickly.
comparisons support this conclusion. First, the prediction model

Two

for stock volatility includes

significantnegative differential intercepts for the days from October20 through November30, 1987.
Second, compared with the next 10 most negative daily stock returns, volatility rose faster at the
time of the October 19 crash, and it fell faster afterwards.
Evidence from the Options and futures markets also supports this conclusion. Estimates from
these markets from 1987—1988 show that stock volatility dropped to pre—crash levels by early 1988
and remained low. These data are only available for the last 6 years, so they cannot be used to study
prior crashes. Nevertheless,they provide more accurateestimates of volatility than the methods using
daily stock returns. When they are available,they corroborate the conclusionsfrom the much larger
sample

of stock returns. Moreover,data from option prices on British stocks

have the same pattern

of stock volatility.
This paper also estimates new models for the behavior of stock volatility. I parameterize the
asymmetric reaction of volatility to negative returns using lagged return shocks along with lagged
measures

of volatility. 1 also use lagged (high-low)spreads to help predict volatility when these data

are available.
Schwert [1987,

19891 shows that

stock volatility was higher during recessions and around the

major banking panics in the 19h and early

20
28

centuries. In part, this

is an

example of the

asymmetryin the return-volatility relation. Negative returns lead to larger increases in volatility than
positive returns. Nevertheless, this historical evidence points Out another difference between the
1987 crash and earlier periods

of high

volatility. There has been no major crisis in the US. financial

system, and there has been no recession accompanying the 1987 crash.
Instead of a microscope, the volatility plots in this paper can be thought of like an
electrocardiogram(ECG). They reflect the pulse of financial markets by measuring the rate of price
changes.

They show the risk borne by investors in the stock market, and where stock volatility

reflects uncertainty about more fundamentaleconomic aggregates (e.g., Schwert [19871), they provide
information about the health of the economy.
