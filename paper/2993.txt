UNRAVELING THE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH SLOWDOWN IN

SCALE ECONOMIES AND MARXUPS

U.S.,

ABSTRACT

Measures of productivity growth typically include in the Productivity
"residual" the impacts of subequilibrium from

fixity of factors, costs of

adjustment, returns to scale and markups. This

paper proposes a general two

part framework for adjusting the residual measure to take these impacts into
account.

Errors computing the weights on output and quasi-fixed input growth

in traditional measures are first

corrected for both primal- and Cost-side

measures. Then the deviation of revenues from costs is used to decompose the
full primal measure to identify the

differential influences of technical

change, utilization fluctuations, scale economies and price margins. Use of
the framework is illustrated

empirically for the U.S.,, Japanese and Canadian

manufacturing sectors, using an econometric model that allows explicit
incorporation and measurement of these influences.

The adjusted measures show

that a significant amount of cyclical and secular change in measured
productivity growth can be attributed to production characteristics other than
technical change, particularly scale economies.

for markups by Hall [1988] on the primal output side. Both these

modifications may be thought of as reflecting error biases in the traditional
measures.

measures are computed for the shadow values of fixed inputs, the extent of
costs of adjustment, the degree of returns to scale, and the deviation between
price and marginal cost for the U.S., Japanese and Canadian manufacturing

sectors. Appropriate measures are then inserted into the framework for

-3-

adjustment of productivity growth measures to yield productivity growth
indexes for these industries that isolate technical change from

the effects of

the other characteristics of the adjustment process.

The measured productivity growth indexes adapted to recognize
subequilibrium and scale economies show that a substantial portion of cost
declines generally attributed to technical change are instead

explained by

other production characteristics, particularly in years of large growth.
These adjustments tend to smooth both cyclical and secular

productivity

fluctuations. Adaptations of output-side measures of productivity growth
isolating the impact of price markups counteract evidence of productivity

slowdowns over time. The modified indexes suggest that traditional measures
increasingly underestimate productivity growth when markups are rising, as the

markup estimates suggest is true. However, when the full series of
corrections are made to accommodate low marginal (as compared to average) cost
of production and capacity utilization fluctuations as well as markup

behavior, the smoothing implication is at least partially offset. This
results because the cost characteristics imply minimal profitability even with

markup behavior, an empirical finding consistent with recent results of Hall
[1989].

II. The Framework for Productivity Adjustment
Analysis of productivity growth is based on determining the increase in

efficiency of production over time. The concept of increasing efficiency can
be formalized in either of two alternative forms; the potential growth in
output when technology changes, holding the use of inputs fixed (the revenue
or primal side), or the possible diminution of costs for given levels of

output and prices of inputs (the cost or dual side). In the case of zero

-4-

profits, choosing the first or second of these approaches is equivalent to
focusing on either the left or right hand side of expression pyY—C, where Y is

output, Py is the corresponding price, and C is total costs. Computations
based on the left hand side of this expression include returns to all cost and
demand characteristics, whereas those based on the right hand side allow
distinctions to be drawn among the impacts of different cost characteristics.
These distinctions can be used to motivate development of a framework
for decomposition of multifactor productivity growth measures to identify
various determinants of increases in output production,

or declines in cost of

production, over time. In this section the standard approach to measurement
of productivity growth is outlined and then adjustments are developed in turn
to take scale economies, fixity, adjustment costs and markup behavior properly
into account.

ha. The Traditional Framework for Productivity Growth Measurement
Assume firms face a production function Y—Y(v,t),

or equivalently a dual

cost function which represents the technology, C—C(p,t,Y), where Y is output,

C is total costs, v is a vector of J

inputs with corresponding prices p, and t

denotes technology (usually measured as a time counter). The various concepts

underlying primal and dual productivity growth measures

are represented using

elasticities of these functions with respect to t: specifically,

3m Y/8t—e and 3m C/3t. These expressions reflect the residuals of
total output (cost) growth less the contributions of the arguments of the

functions other than t. Solow [1958] demonstrated that with perfect
competition, constant returns to scale and instantaneous
residuals isolate technical change.

The primal measure

reveals the potential increase in output between

two time periods using a given amount of inputs. Computation of this residual
is accomplished using accounting or index number methods by calculating the
output change normalized for the changes in inputs as din Y/dt-d].n v/dt

where Sj is the share of input j in terms of the

value of total output (Pjvj/pyY). This equality is derived from the

analogously to the derivation of the primal measure

Under the standard assumptions of CRTS, instantaneous adjustment and
perfect competition, the dual cost share is equivalent to the primal output

share (Sj_Mj). In fact, with these restrictions on the production process,
the primal and dual methods of measuring the productivity growth residual are
identical --

as was shown by Ohta [1975).

Illustrating this relies on the equivalence of the cost and output

shares, which results from the equality pyY=C; revenues just cover costs of

production. More specifically, applying this equality to the cost residual

The equivalence of the two measures arises because constant returns
implies no returns are generated from technological or supply characteristics
such as scale economies; instantaneous adjustment guarantees no returns exist

from varying utilization of inputs (the value of marginal products of inputs
just covers their hire costs, so full utilization is maintained); and perfect

competition ensures no returns to market power. However, if any of these
assumptions is relaxed, returns or profits generated from the underlying
supply and demand characteristics must be taken into account.

lib. Taking Account of Scale Economics

The importance of extending the traditional productivity growth
framework for situations when returns to scale are evident was recognized by

Ohca [1975J. In this case, the pyY=C equality does not hold because returns
to the firm due to scale economies1 cause a deviation between marginal and
average cost, and thus a difference between Py (which under perfect
competition equals marginal cost) and average or unit cost c—AC—C/Y.
1Note that these returns, when measured with aggregated data, could be due
to factors other than internal firm scale economies. For example, "thick
market" external benefits (mentioned in a number of recent macroeconomic
studies including Hall [1989]) could also cause scale economies to be
evident. Another possibility, proposed by Romer [1986], is that if
knowledge has an increasing marginal product external economies will result
which can be considered a scale effect even in the absence of technical
change. The important consideration is whether scale appears to affect
costs, independently of other factors.

-7-

Intuitively, this means that the effects of exploiting returns to scale should
be considered due to productivity growth but to a technological charactistic
of the production process that allows firms to be more efficient at larger

output levels independently of technical change. This suggests two
adjustments to the measurement of multifactor productivity by cost-side
measures.

The first simply requires recognizing that the usual cost-side measure
is no longer valid when the assumption of constant returns to scale is

invalid; it is incorrect and must be adjusted accordingly. In particular, the
above measure based on unit cost changes presupposes that a unit cost function

can be used, because the total cost function can be written as C—Yc(p,t). If

this is not the case, c/c—C/C-Y/Y becomes C/C-y Y/Y, where E—öln C/81n Y
weights the output change and is the inverse of returns to scale. This arises
naturally from the Ohta derivation, where the standard measure is generated by

recognizing that —l with CRTS. More formally, the residual eCt must be
adjusted to

where R denotes the "Returns to Scale Adaptation", and the last term on the
right hand side can be thought of as the bias correction when constant returns

are inappropriately assumed. This bias may be implemented empirically using
either a direct estimate of the elasticity of the cost function, or by taking
the inverse of an independent measure of returns to scale, if one is
available.

-8-

The second adjustment, rather than correcting the traditional measure
for an invalid assumption, adapts the cost side measure to be equivalent to

the output measure. In particular, under CRTS the duality of the cost and
production measures requires proportional cost and output changes, whereas

when nonconstant returns exists this proportionality is lost. Thus, the cost
change arising from a given output change must be divided into the
contribution of the technological change itself and the return to scale

economies. Ohta showed that this could be accomplished by multiplying €cR by

or, cR/ecy_ey. Conceptually this is a decomposition of the primal
measure (which does not have a bias correction because the assumption ey—l
was not used for construction of the measure) into two parts, the effects of
technical change and scale, since the output value reflects both

characteristics of production. This adaptation can also be written in terms

of an additive component; Eyt_ECtR+eCtR[l(l/fCy)), which again can be
computed once an estimate of

is obtained.

In a sense this adjustment simply adapts the cost shares to measure

output shares, since E—MC.Y/C—pyY/C, where MC is marginal cost and perfect

competition is assumed. Thus, dividing by y removes the weight from the
output growth component of the measure and adapts the shares to be specified
in terms of output values or true returns instead of costs.

One other point to mention is that, depending on the context and
interpretation desired, either £ctR or

might be more appropriate to use as

a productivity growth measure. The important impact of Ohta's discussion is
to highlight the two independent factors incorporated in multifactor
productivity measures, not to identify which measure is better, since in some
circumstances one might think scale economies are a valid element of

productivity growth that should be included in the measure. However, in most

-9-

cases it would seem desirable to identify the individual contributions of

technical change and scale. In such a case the decomposition of

Eyt provides

more interpretative potential. If only the technical impact is desired the
measure could be used alone or one could employ the primal measure cyt

multiplied by

or divided by returns to scale.2

lic. Recognizing Subequilibriuxn Impacts

In addition to scale economies, there are a number of other reasons the
pyY—C equality, and therefore the duality of the primal and dual productivity

growth measures, may not hold. Some of these arise when the observed prices
of inputs (or output) do not correctly reflect their marginal contribution to

production. For example, if any inputs are fixed, the values of their
marginal products may differ from their market prices so evaluation of their

contribution by observed prices is generally invalid. In this case the shadow
values of the fixed factors represent their true marginal economic
contributions to the firm, and should be used for productivity growth

computations. It may not be straightforward, however, to identify these
shadow values.

One potential approach to measuring shadow values draws on another type
of cost derivative or elasticity, that of a variable cost function with

respect to a fixed input. More formally, a shadow value can be measured3 as
for any fixed input xk, where C is the variable cost function

C(Y,p,x,t). In this functional representation, the fixity of K factors in the
vector x is explicitly recognized, and the shadow values of these inputs, Zk,

2Note that dividing ECt by Ed is equivalent to multilving C by cay, and
vice versa for Eyt and p.,Y. This can create some confusion since at first
glance this may appear to reverse the adjustments discussed above.

definition and use of this concept.

this notion, we can write total costs C as C—C+Xkpkxk, where Pk is

the market price of input xk, and shadow costs can be defined as C*_G+kZkxK,
which captures the actual or effective value of xk to the firm.

C

and C* will

differ according to the true contribution to generating revenue, or marginal
product, of the fixed inputs, so with perfect competition C* by definition is
equal

to pY. This

equality, in fact, has often been used to compute an ex-

or residual measure of the returns to capital (K) as pyY-C—ZKK, assuming
capital is the only quasi-fixed input and no other returns are mistakenly

attributed to capital.4 Thus, this computation is based on the assumptions of
CRTS, perfect competition and only one fixed input. We will return to
elaborate

on this further below.

The shadow cost function, defined by Berndt and Fuss [1986), has been
shown

Morrison [1986] to be the basis of a cost-side capacity utilization

by

measure

C*/C_CU. When overall excess capacity exists

the shadow valuation of

the fixed inputs will fall short of their market prices on the margin, in

which case this measure is less than one. If stocks are lower than
economically

optimal, however, the shadow values will exceed their market

equivalents

and the measure will exceed one5. Morrison [1986] also showed

that CTJ is equivalent to the short run elasticity of costs with respect to

output, y, measured holding the quasi-fixed factors at their current levels
and

assuming long run CRTS. In sum, these relationships imply that with

subequilibrium

from fixity the pyY—C

equality becomes pyY.CsCU_C.Ey_C*,C.

See, for example, erndt and Hesse [1985).
Note that if some stocks exceed their economically optimal levels and
others fall short of these levels the deviation of the capacity utilization
measure from one is ambiguous; it will depend on the extent of the
deviations for the different fixed inputs.

-11-

Because the contributions to revenue can be separated in this fashion, it is
possible separately to distinguish the impacts of utilization fluctuations
and technical change on productivity growth using the capacity utilization
measure
Modifying the traditional productivity growth residuals correctly to
reflect the impact of fixity can be thought of as simply evaluating fixed

inputs at their shadow values. However, as in the case of returns to scale,
the adaptation of the cost side measure can be expressed in terms of two

conceptually different parts. First, both the standard primal- and cost-side
measures must be adapted to correct for the invalid assumption of
instantaneous adjustment, and then the relationship between the resulting ECt

and

measures can be used to decompose Eye.

The first step toward correction of the cost measure is straightforward
given the above development; the weight on the output growth term must again

be y. However, the deviation of this measure from one is now due to returns
to the fixed input(s):

Therefore, to value these fixed inputs

correctly this must be taken into account for measuring their shares. One way
to think of this is to use the equality ECY—l-EkeCk where

is am c/am xk

for the kth fixed input. This in turn is equivalent to C*/C, since, based on
the definitions of C and Zk, eck can easily be shown to equal (pk-Zk)xk/C.6
Thus, if the Ohta derivation is reworked as in Morrison (1986], the two
adjustments necessary to measure short run productivity growth correctly are

to weight the growth in output by y—(l-kEck) and to correct the shares of
fixed inputs to be ZkXk/C. On the primal side only this latter adjustment

6This arises from the assumption of CRTS and the definition of long run
returns to scale as ECY1—alnc/alnY-+-k8mnc/alnxk=l, which in turn is based on
the long run constant returns assumptions dlnxk/dlnY—1 for all k. For
further details, see Morrison [1986].

where F stands for "Fixity recognized" and the last expression can again be

instantaneous adjustment is assumed when subequilibrium really exists. This
bias is computable either by constructing the elasticities, or by using a

capacity utilization measure and the definition l.kEck_yCUc, if a
justifiable measure is available and one quasi-fixed input

is assumed. Note

that the bias depends on the relative growth rates of output

and the fixed

inputs since the standard assumption that ck° affects the weights on both
these components of the measure.

Although these two equivalent cost measures and the corresponding output
measure €yt'' with the xk valued at their shadow values both correct

traditional measures for the existence of quasi-fixed inputs,

the cost-side

index does not reflect the utilization changes captured in YtF. The cost

measure is based on an elasticity with respect to C rather than C*, and

C,C*pyY. Identifying the independent impacts of utilization and technical
change on multifactor productivity growth, therefore, requires recognizing

that the output side measure is a combination of these two types of returns.

utilization and technical change components can be accomplished by showing

where A represents "Adjustment costs recognized". In terms

of magnitude,

however, the empirical work reported below indicates this adaptation is
generally negligible and thus is of second-order empirical importance.

To this point scale economies and utilization have both been represented

by y, where in the first case y reflects a long run elasticity assuming
instantaneous adjustment and in the second it is a short run elasticity

assuming long run CRTS. However, using relationships already developed these
two effects can individually be represented as components of the ECY
elasticity when both characteristics of the production process

exist. In

particular, it can be shown that the long run elasticity of costs with respect

to output, ECyL, can be written as cyL_

yS+kEcyLEck, or ECY5ECY

where L denotes long run and S (or no supersript) short run.

Since (lkcCk)CUc_C*/C, as mentioned above, it is straightforward to show
that jyiualnC/alnYECyLCUc_(MCY/C*)CUc. In other words, cCy' is defined as
alnC/alnY evaluated at the steady state value of the fixed inputs, Zk,8 or

3C/3Y.(Y/C*)_MC.Y/C*, where MC is short run marginal cost. This scale measure
captures the deviation between average cost (AC) and marginal cost because

AC*.Y(C*/Y) .YC*,MC.Y.
Thus, with when both nonconstant returns to scale and subequilibrium

exist, y is a combined measure of both scale economies and capacity
utilization. Adjusting the pyY—C equality for the difference between returns
and costs requires multiplying C by both components of

to obtain

pyy_cscucyL _C*,1L..MC.Y,C*,C. This collapses to the two earlier cases by
setting C*C for instantaneous adjusment or ECy'1 for CRTS. However, if

8Note we are simply evaluating the derivative at a given value of Zk, not

-15-

these assumptions are invalid and thus are not made, the adjustment by eCy,
and the corresponding adaptation to the productivity growth measures, captures

both the scale and fixed input effects. Again, if independent measures of
scale economies and shadow values of fixed inputs (or capacity utilization

with only one quasi-fixed input) are available, these measures may be used
empirically to assess the difference between returns and costs. However, if
both scale economies and capacity utilization, or multiple quasi-fixed inputs,
exist, it is difficult consistently to identify these measures without
employing a parametric framework.

Adjustments tO correct productivity growth measures and decompose the
primal productivity growth index when both nonconstant returns and fixity
exist may also be carried out simultaneously by distinguishing the two parts

of ecy. The correction to the cost measure requires multiplying the growth in

Also,

costs of adjustment can be incorporated by adding terms analogous to those

found in (4') and (5'). Finally, the decomposition of productivity growth

becomes etT/eyTCUc_eytT, which independently identifies the three parts of
eyT. Again, which individual or combined measure is the most appropriate for
measuring productivity growth depends on the context, but identifying the
components individually refines the measure and facilitates understanding.

lid. Allowing for Markups of Price over Marginal Cost
is if market

A final reason revenues (pyY) will not equal costs (C)

power exists so pySMC. This adjustment is somewhat different conceptually
than the two already outlined; the market power adjustment can be thought of
as a demand side adjustment, In contrast to the first two supply side
adjustments that represent characteristics of costs facing the firm. In fact,
the markup of price over marginal cost is py/MC—l/(l+epy) where €py measures
the markup is

the inverse demand elasticity facing the firm, implying that

completely determined by the demand elasticity. This results because MC—HR in
short run equilibrium for the profit maximizing firm, where HR is marginal
revenue, so the expression for py/MC becomes p../(py+Ys8py/8Y)

_py/(py.(l+8lnpy/8lnY)]1/(l+Epy). The level of marginal cost simply
determines which output level is chosen for evaluation of the markup.

To adjust for markups, the markup ratio py/MC is used to adapt the pyYC
equality to read p1Y—C(py/MC)—C/(l+Epy) (or pyY_C(py/MC)CUEcyL
if nonconstant returns and subequilibrium also exist
So ei,y'l). This measure explicitly incorporates the dependence of revenue on
the cost or supply and demand side elasticities; the adjustment factor
ECY/(l+Cpy) includes the elasticities of both cost and inverse demand with

respect to output. Again the pY measure captures returns to all
characteristics of the production process that cause

whereas C includes

only ex-ante returns to inputs.

Because the markup adjustment pertains to demand, the cost measure of
productivity growth is not affected; construction of cCt depends only on the

cost elasticities and no p—MC assumption is made. However, since markups
affect the deviation between pY and C, there will still be a difference
between primal and dual productivity growth measures. This deviation reflects

-17-

the impact of imperfect markets, and it can be isolated to determine the

impact of technical change independently of market power. The implied
decomposition is similar to those above; the adjustment factor can be used to

show cyT_ ET(l+Epy)/Ey. Multiplication of the cost measure by (l+py)
accounts for the return to market power included in the denominator of the

output shares, which should not be attributed to increased efficiency. The

additive version of this decomposition is EytT_ctT+EctT(1((1+Epy)/ecy)].
Implementation of this decomposition may be carried out either by
parametrically measuring the inverse demand and cost elasticities to construct

the (l+cpy}/ey adjustment factor, or by using available estimates of the
markup, capacity utilization and returns to scale,
It is worth remarking that the markup portion of this decomposition is

analogous to the Hall (1988) notion of "correcting" the Solow (1958] primal
productivity growth residual by evaluating the measure at marginal cost
instead of price. Hall noted that the shares should be evaluated in terms of
MC.Y instead of pyY, implying that the Sj should be multiplied by the markup

ratio py/MC. This is equivalent to multiplying yt by the l/(l+cpy) measure
elaborated above, which is the inverse of the decomposition process proposed

here; it adapts the primal measure to reflect only the cost components. Which
perspective or interpretation of this relationship is most relevant depends on

the context. In addition, if subequilibrium, non-optimal capacity utilization
or multiple quasi-fixed inputs also exist, Hall's nonparametric framework is
not sufficient to untangle these effects.

III. A Related Concept -- Returns to CaDital Measured as a Residual

The analysis in the previous section of the deviation between pY and C
when returns to scale, subequilibrium and market power are present

-18-

distinguishes the returns to inputs from those to cost and demand

characteristics. Thinking of this as a refinement of the concept of returns
to inputs suggests another application of this decomposition,

alluded to

earlier. In particular, the above decomposition can be used to motivate the
residual method of measuring capital returns and suggests an adjustment for
this method if the cost and demand characteristics are important aspects of

the production structure. It also allows further interpretation of the
distinction between ex-ante and ex-Dost returns to factors and their role in

this adjustment process. In this section I pursue these ideas further.
More specifically, returns to capital are often measured as pyY-G, or
revenues less the payments to variable inputs such as labor and, perhaps,
energy and materials if a gross output formulation is used. This is, of
course, only valid if one quasi-fixed input exists so

the residual method is

justified. In this case, if instantaneous adjustment, constant returns to
scale and perfect competition exist, this residual computation measures

both

an ex-post and an ex-ante return to capital.
However, in the absence of instantaneous adjustment, these returns
reflect ex-Dost or shadow returns to capital, ZKK, rather than the ex-ante or

market returns pKK. This can be seen by recognizing that pY incorporates

returns to fixity so pyY.G_C.(C*/C)G_C*GZKK, or alternatively adjusting pY
by dividing by

to capture only ex-ant.e returns; pyY.(C/C*)G_CGPKK.

If instantaneous adjustment exists the measures will be equivalent. If
subequilibrium prevails, however, they will not be. In the latter case either
of these measures could be relevant depending on the application being

considered. The important point is to recognize the difference when returns
to fixity are incorporated, generating the ex-Dost measure, compared to when
they are not, resulting in an ex-ante measure.

-19-

Even this computation, however, does not correctly measure the returns
to capital (either ex-ante or ex-Dost) if p1Y is capturing returns to scale

and market power as well as those truly attributable to capital. In this more
general case adjustments to pyY analogous to those outlined for correcting
primal-side productivity growth calculations must be carried out.

If scale

economies exist, EyL must be divided by pyY to obtain an ex-pos valuation

purged of returns to scale; pyY(C*/(MCSY))G_pyY/EyTG_ZKK or both
adjustments can be made to compute ex-ante returns as pyY(C/C*)(C*/(MCIY))-

G—pyY(C/(MC.Y)) G_pyY/ECy-G—pKK. Similarly, the market power adjustment can
be made to purge the pyY measure of the associated returns, resulting in
or both adjustments can be made

to compute ex-ante returns as yY(MC/P)(C/C*)(C*/(MC1Y)}.GPyY(l+Epy)/Cy
G—PKK.

These manipulations allow the residual method of measuring capital

returns to be adjusted to reflect true returns to capital. This has a number
of implications. First, if the distinction between PK and ZK is not made,
although the primal measure of productivity growth will be correct, it will
not be possible to decompose it into the impacts of technical change and
utilization.

In addition, j

is measured as a residual, more adjustments must be

made to carry out the modifications to productivity growth measures discussed

in the previous sections. Productivity calculations from both the primal and
dual perspective must be based on a corrected measure of returns to capital,
ZK, as discussed in terms of the adjustment to incorporate subequilibrium.

Therefore, if PK is computed as a residual in an attempt to measure ex-post
returns to capital, but imperfect competition exists, the share of capital

should be adapted to purge the returns to market power. This adds an extra

-20-

dimension to the adjustment process for the productivity growth index; the
price of capital measure must be corrected prior to the decomposition of this
index.

Finally, a returns to capital or shadow value of capital equation is
often estimated as part of a system of factor demand equations based on a

variable cost function. The corrected residual computation suggests that this
approach may be used even if returns to scale and imperfect competition exist.
In particular, the shadow value equation procedure involves constructing a

parametric expression for ZK 8G/ÔK for the estimation equation, and computing

the dependent variable as pyY-GZKK. Once this is done, the adjustments
suggested above can be made either to the left or right hand side of the
equation to represent correctly the returns to capital independent of returns
to these other characteristics, although in some cases

this will result in a

very complex equation for estimation purposes.

IV.

Toward EmDirical Measurement of the Adjustment ComDonents
The framework developed in the previous sections reveals that adjustment

of the productivity growth residual or returns to capital relies on cost and
(inverse) demand elasticities with respect to output that have standard
interpretations; they are indexes of capacity utilization, returns

to scale,

and markup power. As mentioned earlier, if one can estimate these
nonparametrically, as Hall [1988) does for the markup, or one has independent
estimates of these values, such as published estimates of capacity

utilization, these adjustments can be carried out directly. However, such
measures may not be appropriate for the data set used, or may not correspond
directly with the economic concepts they are designed to represent (and thus

be mutually inconsistent). Therefore, it is convenient to use an econometric

-21-

model that

is

capable of distinguishing these measures parametrically for a

given body of data.
One model that can be utilized for this purpose is based on a

Generalized Leontief restricted cost function and similarly constructed demand

for output function, as developed in Morrison [1989a]. Combining the
resulting representations of the technology, characterized by unrestricted
returns to scale and multiple quasi-fixed inputs in the cost function, and of
demand behavior, reflected in the inverse demand function, one can allow both
factor demand and price decisions to be represented explicitly.

More specifically, the nonconstant returns to scale Generalized Leontief
cost function with two fixed inputs, capital (K) and labor (L), and two
variable inputs, materials (M) and energy (E), is

the

(Pp)-

-22-

These expressions are used to construCt a system of estimating equations
including (i) the cost function (7) plus the variable input demand equations
for E and M, derived from Shephard's Lemma;

(ii) a MR—MC expression

representing short run price setting using the expressions for marginal
revenue (MR—py+(aPy/3Y)'Y) and marginal cost (MC—8G/8Y);
(iii) two Euler equations9 to reflect adjustment

paths of the two inputs; and,

to complete the system, (iv) the output demand equation.

This system of equations was estimated using three stage least squares,
allowing for endogeneity of both output quantity and price as well as
permitting nonstatic expectations on

the input prices. The data set used

includes similarly constructed data for U.S. manufacturing from Berndt and

Wood [19841, Japanese manufacturing from Takamitsu
and Canadian manufacturing from G. Campbell

Sawa at Kyoto University,

Watkins of DataMetrics in Alberta,

Canada. For further elaboration on the data and estimation methods see
Morrison [1989a,bJ. The data were pooled for estimation, using procedures
outlined in Morrison [1988]. Pooling the Canadian data

with those for the

U.S. and Japan alters the estimates for the U.S. and Japan

(Morrison [1989a1)

and for Canada alone (Morrison [l989b]) slightly but not substantively.

determine the impacts of returns to scale, capacity utilization and the markup
on productivity growth measures through computation of the the bias

V. Distinzuishin the Components of Productivity Change: An Empirical Example

Let us designate ADJecy'cU/(l+Cpy) the full adjustment factor. The
components of this measure, the combined numerator ecyLCU_€cy and ADJ itself
are presented in the second to sixth columns of Table 1 for the U.S., Japan
and Canada)-°

ADJ tends to approximate one closely, which suggests zero

profits on average for these countries due to the the relationship between

revenues and costs. This interpretation stems from the equality C.ADJ=py.Y
which implies ADJ measures py/AC where AC is short run average total cost with
the fixed factors values at their ex-ante prices.

Interestingly,

although short run profits or losses are possible in this model,

the

components of ADJ tend to offset each other, which is consistent with the Hall
[1989] suggestion that monopolistically competitive markets are predominant

in

the U.S.

For the U.S., in 1961-62 and 1974-80 average total costs at least

slightly exceeded average revenue. However, in other years, especially 1968

to 1971, economic profits were

earned; revenues were up to 9% higher than

average costs. In Japan profits

were even larger from 1960 to 1973, although

in 1974 revenues fell short of costs and after that profits were not as large.
1980 and 1981 also appear to have been poor years for Japanese profitability.
The worst years for Japan therefore follow immediately on energy price

increases. In Canada profitability did not vary nearly as much, with revenues
exceeding costs by two percent or more in most years, especially the late

exceeded revenues for

1960s to early 1970s. The only years average costs

Canada were in the first part of the sample; energy price hikes did not appear
to cause the problems with profitability experienced

by the U.S. and Japan.

However, this could at least partly result from including Canada's large
petroleum refining industry in manufacturing,

and from the fact that oil

prices were constrained from rising to world prices in Canada.

The breakdown of the full adjustment index ADJ into its components
provides additional information about what causes

the deviation between costs

and revenues. Economies of scale appear to be an important cost determinant
for all three countries, especially in the later years.

The figures in column

two of Table 1 suggest that marginal cost increasingly falls short of average

(total) cost over time. In this sense economies of scale exist and are

becoming larger. This could be a result of increasing communications and
computer technology, a broader world market, or a number of other changes in
the cost structure of production, although identification of these
determinants cannot be accomplished within this framework.

These cost patterns appear to be accommodated, in the U.S. and
particularly Japan, by investment that results in excess capacity for firms,

and by increasingly large price margins. Capacity utilization changes appear

particularly important in Japan. It might be noted that the significant CU

-25-

declines observed for Japan are a combination of large decreases in the shadow
value to market price ratio for capital along with a smaller decline over time

for labor. The weaker fall in CU for the U.S. arises because the ZIJPL ratio
in the U.S. increases slightly rather than decreasing over time. In Canada

capacity appears instead to be overutilized. CU is larger than one even in
the later years of the sample, although it falls toward one in 1975 and 1980

after the energy price increases. This is true even though the labor shadow
value ratio drops somewhat over time.
The markup of price over marginal cost also has a noticable time trend,
especially in Japan; as marginal costs decline relative to average costs,

price margins increase to compensate. The markups are very similar in the
U.S. and Canada, ranging usually between 10% and 20%, although in Japan they
rise from 6% to 46% during this period. They also have a cyclical trend,
although this pattern differs between Japan and the North American countries.
In general, markups appear to decline during recessions; for example for all

countries the 1973 and 1979 OPEC shocks are reflected in a downturn in the

markup ratio. When all demand and supply impacts are taken into account,
however, the correlations between CU and the markup suggest a tendency for
procyclicality of markups in the U.S. and Canada but countercyclicality in

Japan. This result for the U.S. and Canada is not particularly strong; for
the three countries together there is a - .75 correlation between CiJ and the

markup.11
The impacts on productivity growth measures of the characteristics of
production reflected in these indexes can be computed directly using the

framework developed earlier. Adjustments to correct for the erroneous

countries, Japan has the largest growth rate, although
very poor years, with a 5% productivity

decline in 1974 and a 1% drop in 1975.

The U.S. experienced lower productivity growth and more years of productivity
decline, with 1970 and 1974-75 being the worst years.

Canadian productivity

growth appears roughly similar, with somewhat higher growth in the late 1960s

to early l970s and a worse productivity slump in the early l980s.
The second column captures the impact of correcting for scale effects by
weighting output growth by

as in (3). The impact of this adjustment is

most apparent from the bias correction computations in

the third column. Most

of these numbers are negative, and the biases are particularly large

in the

mid-range of the sample and for Japan. The U.S. and Canada biases exhibit a

very similar time trend. The negative values indicate that a substantial
portion (up to more than 50%) of cost decreases (productivity increases)
observed have been erroneously attributed to technical change when

instead

they arose due to scale economies.

Adjustment for this causes the productivity declines in the 1974-75
period to be smaller than usually thought, especially in the U.S.,

because

-27-

scale economies were not being exploited with stagnation in output growth

during this period. In Canada, the slightly recessionary period of 1969-70
appears worse and only one year of productivity (technical change) increase

remains for 1978-82. In the U.S. scale economies were mainly apparent in the
1963-1969 period and were responsible for most of the cost declines generally

attributed to technical change. The strong productivity growth observed for
1972-73 in standard measures is also tempered by this adjustment. In general,
taking scale economies into account appears to smooth the productivity growth

index; much fluctuation in productivity growth can be "explained" in terms of
incorrect measurement of scale economies.
Adapting the productivity growth measure instead to permit
also

subequilibrium, a procedure that yields the index in the fourth column,

results in many negative bias corrections. It is apparent that incorrectly
dealing with slow adjustment of capital and labor stocks often causes

overestimates of true productivity growth. The pattern is different than that
for scale economies, however; in many cases the correction causes fluctuations
to appear larger rather than smaller, especially for the U.S. and Canada.

The 1970 decline in the U.S., for example, is even greater than before
and exceeds the drop in 1974, although the latter is also more

substantial

than originally estimated. This suggests from (5) that, given that excess
capacity exists (Zk<pk overall), capital growth falls short of output growth.
Later in the 1970s, however, some smoothing takes place; the decline appearing
in 1975 is somewhat attenuated and the increases in 1976 and 1977 are

smaller

with the adjustment. Since CU is still below one in these years, this
suggests relatively strong investment in this period.

In Japan, by contrast,

incorporating utilization changes actually cause measured productivity

growth

-28-

to improve for the earlier years,

although not for 1976 to 1979. Most of the

negative biases for Canada also occur in the mid 1970s and later, causing not
only 1974-75 to look worse, as in the U.S., but also 1980-82. These bias
numbers are not as large as for scale economies, however. Measures including
adjustment costs explicitly, as

in (5'), are reported in the next two columns.

As seen there, incorporation of adjustment

costs does not affect these

patterns significantly.
The total effect of these adjustments, as reported

in the last two

columns, presents a very different picture of "true productivity" or
technical change, than is generally perceived.

slowdown" in the U.S., in

terms of technical change. Traditionally measured productivity increases
resulted from incorrectly including the effects of scale economies and changes

in utilization. Since 1971, however, true productivity appears

to have

improved; except for 1974 and 1978 productivity advances occurred every year,

sometimes substantially. In Japan, by contrast, productivity

growth in the

early 1960s was even better than standard measures indicate. However, much of
the cost declines attributed to technical change in the late 1960s and through
the 1970s appear really to have been due to scale economies.

For Canada the

productivity growth indications are rather bleak for the post-1973 period;
from 1974 on, only in 1976 was there positive true productivity growth.

All

other cost declines resulted from scale economies and utilization

fluctuations. The only years in the sample which improve with the adjustments
for Canada are 1960, 1975, and 1982, the latter two of which were originally
the worst years.

These indexes suggest not only a smoothing process, or an "explanation"

of standard productivity growth fluctuations, by correcting for restrictive

-29-

assumptions, but also provide evidence of smaller productivity growth

increases than generally thought for many years. Although the U.S. is
performing better compared to earlier years and Japan is experiencing strong
but not as spectacular productivity growth as often is thought, Canada is

doing very poorly. Errors in computations are particularly serious when
output growth rates are large or differ significantly from changes in quasifixed input stocks.

Some of the implications suggested by the indexes are highlighted by the
average annual productivity growth rates provided for 1960-81 and pre- and
post- 1973 at the bottom of Table 2, and by the standard deviations reported
for the entire sample period.

For the U.S. the results are dramatic. The average growth rate as
traditionally measured for the entire sample period is .807%, which breaks

down to .976% and .512%, respectively for 1960-73 and

1973-84. Both the scale

and utilization adjustments, however, absorb some of the observed cost
increase, especially for the earlier period, leaving only a .359% and .358%

annual average growth rate for the sub-periods. Further, the standard
deviation of 1.030 from the corrected measure is considerably less than the
a—l.254 of the traditional procedure, indicating that for the U.S. correcting
for biases reduces the cyclical variation.
For Japan, the 1.659% and .459% averages for the sub-periods both drop

with adjustments, to 1.315% and .414%. Again the decline is greater for the
first part of the sample --

the

bias is -.344 as compared to -.045 --

although

the difference between the bias corrections for the two time periods is not

quite as large as for the U.S. Also, the capacity utilization adjustment
actually augments the traditional measure of technical change rather than

-30-

removing a part of the observed growth.

Recognition of subequilibriuin,

however, results in some smoothing in terms of the standard deviations;
o'.-l.974 for the traditional measures, but is 1.888 and 1.943 for the capacity

utilization adjusted indexes with and without adjustment costs incorporated,

respectively. This contrasts with the U.S., for which this adjustment
somewhat increases the standard deviation.
For Canada, comparison with an analogous time period (only to 1981)

suggests that the decreases from standard to corrected measures of technical
change for both periods are almost of the same magnitude. The outcome of
these adjustments is evidence of an increase in true productivity of .371% per
year through 1973, very close to

that for the U.S., but a decrease of .429%

per year for the post-1973 period.

This is a result of cost declines from

both scale and utilization changes which have erroneously

been attributed to

technical change in traditional measures. The impact of scale economies was
particularly strong during the earlier period due to greater

growth. The

standard deviation is also reduced by the adjustments, suggesting

less

fluctuations in measured productivity growth, although this smoothing

results

only from adjusting for scale economies; as for the U.S., adjustments

for

subequilibrium actually augment the variation.

Overall, in the adjusted measures, the much heralded productivity

decline of the 1970s in the U.S. virtually disappears. For Japan and Canada
the slowdown remains, but with lower overall levels of productivity growth

attributed just to technical change for both periods. The evidence from the
annual average growth rates thus reflects a smoothing of the often cited

secular trends. The standard deviations also are reduced significantly with
the adjustments, although most of this impact appears to stem from the

-31-

smoothing effect of correcting for scale economies. This establishes some
smoothing of cyclical patterns.

In addition to correcting the cost-side productivity growth measure for
scale and utilization changes, the other element of the adjustment process
discussed above is the decomposition of the full output-side productivity

change measure from the corrected cost-side measure. To determine the impact
of these adjustments we return to Table 1; the multiplicative factors that
cause the deviation of the cost and primal side measures, are, of course,

simply the indexes already presented there. Several comments are in order.
First note that the difference between the primal and dual productivity
growth measures with all the adjustments taken into account is very small.

This arises because the adaptation of the cost to primal measure simply

requires dividing ECt by ADJ (once all corrections to the weights in the
measures are made), where ADJ, as already discussed, closely approximates one.

Second, interpretation of the trends causing the deviations that do
exist between the primal and dual measures is possible directly from the ADJ
index; if the full productivity change

can be written as -E/ADJ, then

the primal measure exceeds the cost measure as long as ADJ<l. Some positive
component of the output-side measure, therefore, can be attributed to scale
economies, capacity utilization and markups during 1974-1980 for the U.S.;
during the years 1974, 1980 and 1981 for Japan; and in 1960-61

for Canada.

For the U.S. and Japan it tends to be the case that cyt overstates the pure

impact of technical change during recessionary years. Therefore these
adjustments exaggerate both productivity declines and increases;

if these are

years of negative productivity growth, this means the primal measure implies
the decline is worse than is really the case.

-32-

If only one of these cost and demand

characteristics is allowed for,

however, interpretation of the decomposition of the output-side measure is
is less than one as long as economies of

ambiguous. For example, since

scale exist (true everywhere in this sample), EYt always appears to
overestimate the impact of technical change

if only this characteristic is

taken into account in the decomposition of the primal measure. Since scale
economies are increasing, this overestimation productivity growth years -

- is

- even

for negative

greater in the later years of the sample.

Finally, if instead, the focus is to adjust for markups, the primal side

productivity growth measure can be "corrected" by multiplying it by

y/MCI/(l+ipy).12 This measure is presented in the last column of Table 1.
Since the markup ratio always exceeds one and has been increasing, the
adjusted measure always is greater than the standard measure, and any slowdown
in productivity growth over time (as long as growth remains positive) appears
less consequential with the adjustment.

Again, however, this independent adjustment for demand characteristics
can be misleading if cost characteristics such as scale economies exist that
should be accommodated; since these characteristics tend to counterract each

other in terms of profitability. The advantage of the approach

taken in this

paper is that all these impacts are simultaneously considered within an

integrated, coherent framework. Moreover, the empirical significance is
substantial; for the U.S. when all the adjustments are taken into account
slowdown is entirely eliminated.

VI. Cpncludin2: Remarks

This paper has provided an integrated framework for correcting and
decomposing cost and primal productivity growth measures to consider the
impacts of scale economies, subequilibrium, costs of adjustment and markup

behavior. This framework has then been then used to assess productivity
fluctuations in the manufacturing sectors of three countries, the U.S., Japan
and Canada.

The results suggest that a significant portion of cost declines in
production resulting from scale economies and capacity utilization
fluctuations has been erroneously attributed to technical change.

Since the

marginal cost of production has fallen over time relative to average cost,
this has contributed to observations of a productivity growth slowdown over

time. Declines in capacity utilization, on the other hand, have sometimes
obscured true productivity increases, particularly in Japan.

Two types of adjustments have been developed and implemented for
identifying the impacts of these characteristics of production. The first
corrects both cost and primal productivity growth measures

traditional measurement procedures typically used. These

for errors in the

corrections involve

changing the weight on the output growth term in the dual measure for both
scale economies and fixity, and altering the weight on the quasi-fixed input
growth terms in both primal and output measures to account for subequilibrium

and adjustment costs. These adjustments, and the corresponding

"biases" in

the traditional measures, have been shown to have substantial empirical
impacts on the trends reflected in productivity growth

indexes.

The second adjustment can be thought of as a decomposition of the primal
measure to identify the separate impacts of scale economies, fixity and
markups on the full output-side measure of productivity growth.

if markups have been rising, as

if it is recognized that y'1 due to

economies of scale and fixities, the remaining

component of yt includes these

effects. Incorporating this tends to neutralize the initial implication.
The results reported here therefore provide a number of important
insights about the relationships between different characteristics of
production and economic performance

indicators. They also suggest a partial

"explanation" for observations of a productivity

growth slowdown, since in

periods of significant growth firms can take advantage of potential cost
savings from scale economies and markups appear larger, resulting in an

overestimate of productivity growth. This is evident,

The reverse occurs in the

later 1970s. Capacity utilization fluctuations may, however, compensate at
least somewhat for this; if expectations are optimistic,

scale economies exist

and current investment is therefore strong, capacity utilization may decline.
which may cause measured productivity to be biased downward.

This appears to

be the case particularly for Japan in the l9lOs and early l980s.
