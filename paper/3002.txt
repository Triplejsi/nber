THE IMPACT OF A BAN ON LEGALIZED ABORTION ON
ADOLESCENT CHILDBEARING IN NEW YORK CITY

ABSTRACT

This paper attempts to forecast the change in adolescent childbearing
With
among New York City residents following a ban on legalized abortion.
monthly data on the number of births to white and black adolescents from
January, 1963 to December, 1987 we used an interrupted time-series analysis
to estimate the change in adolescent childbearing that followed the
liberalization of the New York State abortion law in 1970. We found the
level of births to black adolescents living in New York City fell 18.7
percent between 1970 and 1971, or approximately 142 fewer births per month
The level of white births fell 14.1 percent or approximately 111
(p<.O0l).
The absolute value of the percentage
fewer births per month (p<.OO1).
changes in births between 1970 and 1971 were applied to the forecasted number

of monthly births in 1988 and 1989.
to New York City adolescents beginning January 1, 1988, there would have been
2143 black and 1067 white unintended births to teenagers in the first two
years of a ban. The results suggest that a prohibition on legalized abortion
would have a substantial increase in adolescent childbearing across the U.S.
although the magnitude of the change will vary according to local conditions.

(Pakter

annual,

age—specific fertility rates within and across states

(Sklar and Berkov 1974,

Bauman et

al.

1977,

Quick 1978).

The

findings suggest that the legalization of abortion had an important

impact on fertility. Again, the variation over time was limited to
at most seven years.

Our study differs sub8tantially in that it is a time—series
analysis with monthly data that spans 25 years. The large number
of observations allows for a more sophisticated means of fitting
the

data.

For

example,

we use

the

Box—Jenkins

time—series

methodology to pxedict the monthly number of births to New York
City adolescents that would have been observed had abortion not
been liberalized in 1970 (Box and Jenkins 1976). Comparing these

estimates to the actual number of births between 1970 and 1971
yields a first approximation of the number of births that were
averted by the change In the law.

The estimates are refined by

means of intervention analysis: a technique for determining

the

magnitude, form, and statistical significance of the change in a
2

time—series following a major external event (Mc Cleary and Hay
1980, Vandaele 1983). Finally, we use the model obtained by the
intervention analysis to forecast the time—path of teenage births
following a ban on legalized abortion.

We have limited our analysis to adolescents for several
reasons. First, the medical, social and economic consequences of
teenage

pregnancy

are

staggering

(National

Research

Council

1987a,b). Second, the proportion of teenagers who become pregnant
has changed relatively little over the past 15 years. Approximately

one out of ten adolescents aged 15—19 becomes pregnant every year

and in 1988 about 86 percent of the pregnancies were unintended
(Jones et al. 1988). Third, adolescents are disproportionate users
of abortion and thus, would be more affected by an overturn of Roe
versus Wade.

Nationally, 30 percent of all abortions performed in

the United States are to teenagers and 40 percent of all adolescent

pregnancies are terminated by induced abortion (National Research
Council 1987a).
The analysis was restricted to New York City because we needed

an area in which the availability of legalized abortion would be
as radically altered by a ban as it had been by the

liberalization

of abortion laws. The 1970 New York State abortion statute had the
fewest restrictions of any state law in the country.

Before July,

1970 there had been few legal abortions performed in New York City
(Erhart et al. 1972).More importantly, prior to the change in 1970,

pregnant adolescents had essentially no access to legal abortion.

Although Hawaii, Alaska and Washington state had laws similar to

the

change

in

adolescent childbearing among New York city residents after the
1970 law became effective was not diminished by migration to other

states. This was not true for residents of other states after the

passage of the New York State law.

Between July 1970, and June

1971, 75.4 percent of the 33,964 abortions performed on adolescents

in New York City

were to out-of—state residents (Pakter et al.

1973). The upshot is that New York city offers a unique setting
from which to understand the changes In adolescent childbearing
that followed the liberalization of abortion, and what is likely
to occur if legal abortion is banned.

The methodology is often

referred to as the Box—Jenkins approach to time—series modeling
(Box and Jenkins 1976). The objective is to use the observed data

to describe the underlying time—series process in as concise a
manner as possible.

The first step is to decompose the stationary

portion of the series into its autoregressive and moving average
parts.

Once a tentative representation has been established, the

parameters of the model are estimated and then diagnosed to insure

that the unexplained portion of the model, the residuals, are a
random or white noise process.

If the checks prove satisfactory,

then forecasts can be generated.

The

hypothesis maintained in this study is that the 1970 New York State

Law which liberalized abortion had an important

impact on the

number of adolescent pregnancies that resulted in live births. The
law became effective on July, 1 1970.

However, because the law did

not apply to pregnancies greater than 24 weeks, the effect of the
law on the number of live births would not be observed for at least

16 to 20 weeks later. Thus, November,

1970 became the starting

point of the intervention. Furthermore, the full impact of the law

on adolescents births would not be possible until April of 1971
when

adolescents who

conceived on or after July 1, 1970 reached term. Consequently, the
intervention variable was specified in such a manner that the law's

impact on the number of adolescent births increased gradually from
November, 1970 through April, 1971.
The rate at which the law's impact grew between November arid

April was based on the distribution abortions to New York City
residents the first year the law was in effect.

For example, 6.1

percent of all abortions to New York City residents were to women

whose pregnancies were beyond the twentieth week (Tietze 1973).
Assuming the distribution of abortion by gestational age was the
same for every month in the first year, the proportion of the law's

gestation, and the other 15 percent were performed between 17 and
20 weeks gestation.

Thus, in December, the proportion of the law's

full impact would be .216.

This accounts for the 6.1 percent of

the women who aborted in August,

whose pregnancies were

1970

greater than 20 weeks gestation and for the 15 percent of the
abortions in July, 1970 to women whose pregnancies were between 17
and 20 weeks gestation.

Following this algorithm and noting that

64 percent of all abortion were performed in the first trimester,

the figures for the remaining months were as follows:

January, .574 in February, .785 in March, and 1.0 in April and all

by a MA(1) process. For blacks, the first autocorrelation of the

Expressed as a percentage,

the level of black adolescent

births fell 18.7 percent after the liberalization of abortion in
July 1970.

White births fell 14.0 percent. By using the estimated

percentage changes and taking into account the gradual transition
between November 1970 and April 1971, one can calculate the total

number of adolescent births that were averted in the 24 month
period after July 1970.

If we assume the average number of births

over twelve months prior to July, 1970 is an estimate of the pre—

intervention level of births, then 2588 black adolescent births

and 1998 white adolescent births were averted in the 24 months
after July, 1970.

These figures are smaller than the ones obtained

unintended pregnancy has probably risen since 1970 despite the
increased use of contraception among adolescents. In this respect,
our projections may underestimate the impact of a ban on legalized
abortion.

One explanation for the rising pregnancy rate is that the

Thus,

There

evidence to support either explanation. A recent survey of abortion

patients reports that less than one percent of the women who used
no contraception admitted doing so because they relied on abortion

(Henshaw and Silverman 1988). And although little is known about

the relationship between aborUon availability and the effective
use of contraceptives, a teenager who aborted a pregnancy was iess

likely to become pregnant again over the next 24 months than was

a comparable adolescent who carried her first pregnancy to term
(Koenig and Zelnik 1982).

As mentioned above, there has been an apparent rise in the
proportion of births to whites of Hispanic origin in New York City.

Based on the little data that exists, Hispanic adolescents are more
sexually active than their white, non—Hispanic counterparts. At the

same time, Hispanic adolescents are more likely to be married and
less

(Hayes

1987,

The

upshot,

therefore,

is that the suspected increase in the proportion of

births to white adolescents of Hispanic descent is unlikely to have

altered our predictions n any meaningful manner from what they
would have been had the proportion of white births of Hispanic
descent remained unchanged since 1970.

with respect to the statistical analysis we imposed a number
of restrictions that should also be made explicit.

For example,

instead of fixing the rate at which the law's impact grew between

November 1970 and April 1971, an alternative specification would

have been to model the intervention component as a first—order
transfer function (McCleary and Hay 1g80).

age explains in large part why initially, the impact of the law was

gradual. But the availability of abortion services in the early

the Jaw from being realized. There was considerable confusion in
New York City with respect to the legality of performing abortions

in doctorTs offices and free—standing clinics (Lader 1973).

(Tietze 1973)

Moreover, abortions performed in hospitals were at

least twice as expensive as the ones performed in free—standing
clinics or physicians' offices. Teenagers, especially minorities,

were probably more affected by the price and non—price barriers
17

since they were less likely to have access to private gynecological

care. In sum, the step function we imposed assumes the law became
fully effective in April, 1971, yet other factors may have further

delayed the new law from realizing its full impact.
To examine this proposition, we re—estimated the effect of the

1970 abortion law by using a first—order transfer function model.

methodology described in Burt (1986), the present discounted cost

dollars above what it would have cost to support the same teenager

and her family had she delayed childbearing until after she was
twenty years of age. Thus, the total marginal cost5 of supporting
the 689 white and 1384 black births described above would be 11.5
million dollars.

The relative changes in adolescent childbearing among whites

and blacks following a prohibition on legal abortion reported in

this paper cannot be generalized to other parts of the country
because the forecasts are ba5ed on a set of circumstances specific

to New York City in 1970.

However,
