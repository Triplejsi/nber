INCENTIVES AND GOVERNMENT RELIEF FOR RISK

ABSTRACT

Government relief is offered for a wide range of risks - - natural
disaster, economic dislocation, sickness and injury. This paper explores the
effect of such relief on incentives and the allocation of risk in a model
with private insurance.
It is shown that government relief is inefficient,
even when its level is less than the private insurance coverage that
individuals would otherwise have purchased and even when private insurance
coverage is incomplete due to problems of moral hazard.

This paper

examines the effect of such relief on incentives and the allocation of risk in
a model with private insurance.

The primary conclusion is that government

relief distorts individuals' incentives:

account only their own exposure to loss

rather

Individuals' decisions take into

-

the portion of loss uncompensated

than the total loss.

Moreover, given the

availability of private insurance, the resulting loss from distorted
incentives exceeds any benefit from relief in allocating risk.

The paper begins with the straightforward situation in which insurance
companies can observe individuals' risk-reducing behavior.

In this case, as

is well recognized, insurance policies in which premiums are based on behavior
allow individuals to achieve a first-best outcome (in which insurance against
loss is complete and incentives are not distorted) without government relief.
With relief, however, a first-best outcome is not achieved.

Individuals

purchase full insurance coverage against their exposure, so that relief and
insurance completely compensate for any loss.
to behave optimally.

But individuals are not induced

They are concerned only about how their behavior affects

their insurance premiums, which, of course, are based on their exposure rather
than total losses; as a result, the effect of risk-reducing behavior on the
expected cost of government relief is ignored.

The paper then considers the situation in which insurance companies cannot
observe individuals' risk-reducing behavior.

In this case, which involves

moral hazard, individuals generally purchase less than complete coverage
-

against

their exposure, in order to retain some incentive to reduce risk.

Relief, as distinguished from insurance, typically is not at a level chosen
by individuals and does not entail charging individuals a premium that is a
function of their observable behavior (including the level of insurance
coverage they purchase).

-1-

Here government relief distorts insurance decisions and thus behavior as well:
In determining the degree of residual risk to bear, individuals do not take
into the account that their incentives to reduce risk affect the expected cost
of government relief.

I comment briefly on the range of

longer bear the full cost of their actions.

Such relief is inefficient even

when insurance coverage is incomplete due to moral hazard.

If the probability is underestimated significantly,

government relief may have less of an adverse effect on incentives while
spreading risk for which individuals would not choose to purchase insurance.
Compulsory government insurance, however, would be more efficient than relief:
For example, one who contemplated construction on a flood plain and
underestimated the risk of a flood would be led to make a more efficient
decision if notified in advance of the compulsory premium that would be
charged -for different levels of investment in different locations.

that government insurance (optional or compulsory) that imposes an actuarially

supplementary coverage has wholly different effects from those of government
relief.
