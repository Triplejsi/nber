INFLATION INSURANCE

ABSTRACT

A contract to insure $1 against inflation is equivalent to a
European call option on the consumer price index. When there is
no deductible this call option is equivalent to a forward
contract on the CPI. Its price is the difference between the
prices of a zero coupon real bond and a zero coupon nominal bond,
both free of default risk. Provided that the risk—free real rate
of interest is positive, the price of such an inflation insurance
policy first rises and then falls with time to maturity. It is a
decreasing function of the real interest rate and an increasing
function of both the expected rate of inflation and the real risk
premium on nominal bonds.
When a deductible is introduced, the insurance policy can no
longer be priced like a CPI forward contract. The option feature
has its greatest value when the deductible is close to the
forward rate of inflation, defined as the difference between the
risk—free nominal and real interest rates. Such inflation
insurance contracts are priced using the model developed by
Black-Merton-Scholes. Pricing an inflation insurance policy with
a cap requires only a minor modification of the model.
The approach presented in this paper permits fairly precise
quantification of the cost of implementing proposals to index
pension benefits for inflation. It also gives us a way of
estimating the savings to the Social Security system that would
result from introducing a deductible.
Key words:

Inflation, insurance, forward contract, call
option, put option, contingent claim, deductible,
cap, futures contract, CPI, dynamic hedging,
portfolio rebalancing.

i.

Introduction
Most economists would agree that inflation is inevitable in

a market economy that wants to enjoy nearly full employment. If
we could perfectly predict the rate of inflation, then it would

not be much of a problem. Since we cannot, uncertainty about
the rate of inflation is a major problem for large segments of
our population.

The way risk-averse people cope with risk is to buy

insurance. Not all risks, however, are insurable. Until
recently there was no efficient way for people to insure against

inflation risk in the U.S. In the past investors have sought
protection from inflation risk by investing in real estate,

precious metals, and even more esoteric asset classes. But all
of these so-called inflation hedges are only imperfectly
correlated with the consumer price level and expose the investor
to other risks that may exceed the risk of inflation.1

Recent innovations in the U.S. now make it possible to hedge

inflation risk quite efficiently. Several financial institutions
have recently issued securities linked to the U.S. consumer price

level. The new securities were issued first by the Franklin

'Research by Bodie [1982] has shown that incorporating these
other assets in one's portfolio does not help very much in reducing
the variance of one's real rate of return.

savings Association of Ottawa, Kansas, in January 1988 in two

different forms. The first is certificates of deposit, called
Inflation-Plus COs, insured by the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), and paying an interest rate tied
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Interest is paid monthly and is equal to a stated real rateplus
the proportiona increase in the CPI during the previous month.
As of this writing (May 1989), the real rate ranges from 3% per
year for a one—year maturity CD to 3.2% per year for a ten—year
maturity.

The second form is twenty—year noncallable collateralized

bonds, called Real Yield Securities or REALs. These offer a
floating coupon rate of 3% per year plus the previous year's
proportional change in the CPI, adjusted and payable quarterly.
A recent issue of similar bonds includes a put option.
Two other financial institutions have recently followed the

lead of Franklin Savings.2 If the trend continues, we have
reached a milestone in the history of this country's financial

markets. Consider that for years prominent economists at all
points of the ideological spectrum have argued that the U.S.
Treasury should issue such securities, and scholars have
speculated why private markets for them have not hitherto

21n August 1988 Anchor savings Bank became the second U.S.
institution to issue REALs, and in September 1988 JHM Acceptance
Corporation issued modified index-linked bonds subject to a nominal
interest rate cap of 14% per annum. The investment banking firm
of Morgan Stanley and Company is the underwriter and market maker
for REALs.

developed.3 The current innovative environment in the U.S.
financial markets appears to finally have put an end to this
speculation by producing private indexed bonds in several forms.

The emergence of a market for virtually risk-free securities
linked to the U.S. consumer price level makes possible a host of
other financial products that offer a variety of inflation

insurance features. The purpose of this paper is to describe
some of the most likely of these inflation insurance products and
to show how they can be created and competitively priced.

be the consumer price level at time t. With no

loss of generality let the current price level be 1 (that is,

P(O) =

1).

Let r(T) be the riskless real rate of interest on a

default—free CPI—linked zero coupon bond maturing T years from

now. By definition e dollars invested in such a bond now will
pay P(T) dollars at time T.

Let R(T) be the riskless nominal rate of interest on a

U.S. Treasury bill). By definition eT dollars invested in such
a bond now will pay $1 at time T.

other words, a CPI forward contract is equivalent to a

long position in a zero coupon real bond and a short position in

a zero coupon nominal bond of the same maturity. By arbitrage
the price of the contract is therefore the difference between the
prices of these two bonds.

Figure 1 and Table 1 present the prices of real and nominal
zero coupon bonds and the price of the CPI forward contract as a

function of maturity. They assume a flat ten structure for both
real and nominal risk—free interest rates with r(T) equal to 3%

per year and R(T) equal to 9% per year for all maturities.

forward contract with respect to T are given by the formulas:

Prices of Real Bonds, Nominal Bonds, and CPI Forward
Contracts as a Function of Time to Maturity

The figure assumes that the riskless real rate of

assumed to be 1.

The rising cost for the shorter maturities is caused by the

prices of nominal zero coupon bonds declining more rapidly with
maturity at first than the prices of the corresponding real

bonds. Eventually, however, this is reversed. The value of the
forward contract approaches the price of the real bond
asymptotically as an upper bound and must therefore decline with
it.

Under our assumptions the cost of insuring a dollar against
inflation reaches a maximum of 38.5 cents for a maturity of 18.3

years. The cost of insuring a dollar to be received one year
from now is only 5.7 cents and of a dollar to be received 50
years from now 21 cents.

These costs are, however, quite sensitive to the assumptions

that we have made. In the next section we examine this
sensitivity.

its maturity and the riskiess real and nominal rates of interest.

By definition the relationship between these two interest rates

us define the expected real rate of interest on a

nominal bond

as the risk-free nominal rate minus the expected

rate of inflation: E(r) = R - ir.

Then it follows that this

expected real rate on the nominal bond will exceed the risk—free

real rate of interest (r) by the risk premium (#).'

Let

us maintain the assumption that the term structures of

real and nominal risk—free rates are both flat and consider the
effect of an increase in the risk—free real rate, holding
constant expected inflation and the risk premium on nominal

bonds. Under this assumption, any increase in r will be matched
by an equal increase in R.

The effect on the prices of CPI forward contracts is

presented in Figure 2 and Table 2. We assume that the spread
between the nominal and real risk—free interest rates is 6% per

year. An increase in the real interest rate causes a downward
shift in the prices of CPI forward contracts of all maturities.
The first and second derivatives of the price of the CPI
forward contract with respect to r are:

—TeT + Te

= —Tf

£2f=T2f
Thus the effect of an increase in the real interest rate is
always to lower the value of a CPI forward contract.

For example, consider a CPI forward contract maturing in 10

years. By reading across the corresponding row of Table 2 we see
that the price of the contract falls from a high of 45.12 cents

when the real interest rate is 0 to a low of 16.6 cents when the
real rate is 10% per year.
The first column in Table 2, which corresponds to a real

interest rate of zero, deserves special comment. Note that the
price of a CPI forward contract rises continuously with maturity
as one reads down the column and approaches the value of $1

asymptotically. The reason is that when the real interest rate
is zero, the price of a zero coupon real bond is $1 no matter
what the maturity.
Now let us consider the effect of an increase in the

expected rate of inflation, holding constant r and q. An
increase in the expected inflation rate will cause the riskless

nominal rate to rise. This will cause the prices of nominal
bonds of all maturities to fall and the prices of CPI forward

contracts to rise. Figure 3 and Table 3 show this effect.
The first and second derivatives of the price of the CPI
forward contract with respect to 7r

are:

Thus the effect of an increase in the expected rate of inflation
is always to raise the value of a CPI forward contract.

Figure 3. Price of a CPI Forward Contract as a Function of

Notes:

The figure assumes that the term structures of real and

rate by 1% plus the expected inflation rate. The
forward price is assumed to be 1.

2.2 Forward Rates of Inflation and the Term Structure of Nominal
and Real Interest Rates.

Let us now consider a forward contract with a forward price

where i is some contractually specified rate of

equal to elt

inflation.

The payoff to the forward contract at maturity is:

e

P(T) -

can replicate that payoff by going long one indexed bond

We

and short & nominal bonds. The cost of establishing this
position is:

(eT) = eT eCI_Rfl = e_T —
Let us define the T-period forward rate of inflation as the
=

f

value

e1

— e'1

FT

—

of i that makes the value of a CPI forward contract

maturing at tine T equal to zero. Equivalently, the forward
inflation rate is that rate of inflation which would make the
realized return on a real bond equal to the realized return on
the corresponding nominal bond.

It follows that the forward rate of inflation, i*(T), is the
difference between the risk-free nominal rate and the risk—free
real

rate of interest:
i*(T) =

It

R(T)

—

r(T)

also follows that the forward rate of inflation is the

sum of the expected rate of inflation plus the risk premium:
i*(T)

=

ir(T)

+

0(T)

We can directly measure the term structure of forward rates
of inflation from the observed term structures of real and
14

nominal interest rates. But we cannot know without making
further assumptions what fraction of the forward rate for any
maturity is expected inflation and what fraction is the risk
premium.

As of this writing (May 1989) the term structure of risk—

free real interest rates is slightly upward sloping. The 1 year

rate is 3% and the 10 year rate 3.2%) The term structure of
nominal rates as reflected in the U.S. Treasury yield curve is

approximately flat at 9% per year. This implies a term structure
of forward inflation rates that is slightly downward sloping:
from 6% per year for a 1 year maturity to 5.8% per year for a 10

year maturity.6 Throughout the rest of this paper, however, we
will assume flat term structures for both real and nominal
interest rates.

A forward contract is not what most people have in mind when

they talk about insurance. Insurance is a contingent claim that
pays the policyholder a specified amount if the contingency

and nothing otherwise, whereas a forward contract may
entail the payment of money by the contract holder at the
occurs

Plus Certificates of Deposit, which are insured up to $100,000 by
FSLIC.

maturity of the contract.

In our example a more correct specification of the insurance
contract would be that the payoff at T is:

Max [0, P(T) — 1]
This is the same as the payoff to a European call option on the
CPI with an exercise price of $1 maturing at time T.

From the put—call parity theorem we know that a European
call option is equivalent to a forward contract plus a European

put option. Here the put has the following payoff:
Max [0, 1 —

P(T)].

In other words the put is deflation insurance.
Thus an inflation insurance policy (the call option) is

equivalent to a forward contract on the CPI plus a deflation
insurance contract (the put option).

By an arbitrage argument, the price of the call must equal
the price of the forward contract plus the price of the put:

c= fl-p
If the probability of deflation (that is, P(T) C 1) over the

term of the inflation insurance policy is virtually zero, then
the put will be virtually worthless and the price of the call
will

equal the price of the forward contract.

3.1 Inflation Insurance with a Deductible.
But suppose that there is a deductible in the policy.
deductible

The

might specify that the contract compensates the holder

only for inflation above some specified rate of i per year.
16

Then

the exercise price of the call option is

and the put option

is now insurance against inflation being less than i.

It will be

valuable if i gets close to 1*.

If we set the deductible equal to the forward rate of
inflation, then the price of the forward contract will be zero

and the price of the call will exactly equal the price of the
put.

3.2 Black-Merton-ScholeS Valuation of Inflation Insurance
The price of the inflation insurance will depend on the
stochastic processes for the rate of inflation and the real and

nominal risk—free interest rates. Since inflation insurance is
isomorphic to a European call option the method developed by
Nerton £1973] and Black and Scholes [1973] can be applied here.
If we assume that the stochastic behavior of P(T) can be
approximated by a diffusion process and that interest rates are
nonstochastic, then we can apply a modified form of the Black—
Scholes option pricing formula:7

= N(di)e' — N(d2)XeT
exercise price on the option is determined by the
C

The

inflation rate one establishes as the "deductible," (that is,

7To be more precise, we assume that the CPI follows an Ito
process of the form: dP/P = adt + adz

where dz is an increment of a standard Wiener process with zero
mean and variance of 1, a is the instantaneous mean rate of
inflation per unit time, and a2 the variance per unit time.
17

x = eT). Table

4 and Figure 4 present the value of this call

option and the value of a corresponding forward contract for a 10

year maturity as a function of the deductible, when the riskiess
real interest rate is 3% per year, the riskiess nominal rate is
9% per year, and the standard deviation of the rate of inflation
-

is 3% per year.

The forward contract is assumed to have a forward price
equal to the exercise price on the option. For values of i
greater that i* the value of the forward contract is negative.

For low values of i the value of the call is virtually

identical to the value of the forward contract. This is because
the probability that the call will wind up out-of-the-money is

virtually zero. (Equivalently, the value of the corresponding
put option is virtually zero for low values of i.)

For values of i

greater

than 6% per year (the forward

inflation rate), the value of the forward contract is negative.

The value of the call option however, can never be negative. It
approaches zero asymptotically as i increases.

Consider the value of the inflation insurance policy that

has a deductible equal to the forward rate of inflation. We know
that for such a policy the corresponding forward contract has

zero value. The value of the call in this case is:
C = [N(d1) -

N(d2)]eT

Table S and Figure 5 present the value of this inflation
insurance policy as a function of maturity for two different

values of a, the volatility of the rate of inflation. Note that
the value of the call first rises and then falls with maturity.
This pattern is the same as we observed for the CPI forward

contract with a forward price of 1 in Figure 1. The reason for
it is similar. As with forward contracts, the value of a call
option can never exceed the value of the security on which it is

written. Since the value of the real bond goes to zero as T
increases (provided that the real interest rate is positive), so
too must the value of the CPI call option.

Note that the value of the option increases with volatility.

This is a well-known result in option pricing theory. It
reflects the asymmetric payoff structure of the call option.

Increasing the volatility increases the upside potential without
increasing the downside risk.

3.3 Inflation Insurance with a Cap.
Often the cost-of-living adjustments that are promised under
certain pension plans and life insurance company annuities are

subject to a cap. Our previous analysis can easily be modified
in order to price such an inflation insurance policy.

The only adjustment needed to the model presented in the
preceding section is to subtract from the price of an inflation
insurance policy with no deductible the price of a policy that
has a deductible equal to the specified cap rate of inflation.
The price of an inflation insurance policy with a cap is
therefore equal to the price of a CPI call option with an
exercise price of 1 minus the value of a CPI call option with
exercise price e'1, where c is the cap on the inflation rate.

For example, consider an inflation insurance policy that is

capped at 4% per year. Assume that r
and a =

3%

3%, R = 9%, T = 10 years,

per year. The price of the CPI call option with no

deductible is 33.42 cents.

The price of the CPI call option

with a deductible equal to 4% per year is 13.47 cents. The price
of the capped inflation insurance policy is therefore 19.95
cents.

How to Produce Inflation Insurance
In the preceding section we derived the prices of CPI call

options using the Black-Merton—Scholes method. Now let us
explain how that method allows us to synthesize CPI call options

from real bonds and nominal bonds. In order to clarify the
process it is useful to think of a financial intermediary that
issues inflation insurance policies (CPI calls) and wants to
hedge them by a suitable investment strategy.
In calculating the price of a CPI call option using the

modified Black-Scholes formula, we computed N(d1). This is
called the hedge ratio, and it is the number of real bonds that

the intermediary must buy per CPI call option sold. Thus if
N(d1) is .5, the intermediary would invest in one half of a real

bond per $1 that it is insuring and would borrow N(d2)XeT
dollars at the risk-free nominal rate.

Once the intermediary issues an inflation insurance policy
it must continuously rebalance its portfolio to remain perfectly

hedged. The hedge ratio will usually change as a result of
changes in T and the realized rate of inflation. The process of
continuously rebalancing the portfolio is called dynamic
hedging

8

Table 6 and Figure 6 present the hedge ratio as a function
of the deductible for the case where r = 3%, R = 9%, T = 10

years, and a = 3%.

8See chapter 19 in Bodie, Kane, and Marcus [1989] for a
discussion of dynamic hedging.

Inflation-Protected. Annuities.

If inflation insurance became available, it is likely that
the major demand for it would be to insure pension benefits.10

The cost of insuring a stream of nominal payments against
inflation is the sum of the costs of insuring each individual
payment.

Table 7 and Figure 7 present the cost of insuring a 20 year
nominal annuity of $1 per year against inflation as a function of

the deductible. Thus, with a zero deductible, the cost of
inflation insurance is $5.95. Since the price of the nominal
annuity is $8.86, this means that the cost of insuring it fully
against inflation is 67% of its value.

The cost of inflation insurance with a deductible equal to
the forward inflation rate (6% per year) is $.52 or roughly 6% of

the value of the nominal annuity. And the cost of "catastrophic"
inflation insurance, defined as a policy with a deductible equal
to 10% per year, is only $.002 or .02% of the value of the bond.

10For a discussion of this issue see Bodie [1989).

The Role of the Government
For many years economists considered it desirable, if not

downright essential, for the Federal government to issue cpx—
linked bonds in order to lay the foundation for inflation

insurance. Economists like Milton Friedman, Franco Modigliani,
and James Tobin, who hold very different opinions on other
issues, were united in their enthusiastic support for the idea of

the U.S. Treasury's issuing CPI-linked bonds. Even now many
people think that the only entity that can truly guarantee
default—free inflation insurance is the Federal government.

While that proposition is strictly speaking true, it is
equally true that private insurance can be almost free of default

risk. A private insurance company can offer policies that are
virtually

free of default risk through a combination of three

elements:

(1) diversifying the risk of its liabilities through

risk—pooling (as life insurance companies do with their life
insurance policies), (2) hedging the risk of its liabilities
through appropriate investment strategies, and (3) maintaining
adequate equity capital so that the residual risk that is not
diversified away or hedged away by the company's investment
strategy is fully absorbed by the company's shareholders.

Inflation insurance is not a diversifiable risk in the
aggregate, so the first of the three elements is not available.

But diversifiability of risk is neither a necessary nor a

sufficient condition for it to be insurable. An insurance
company or other financial intermediary can use a combination of
32

the other two elements to provide nearly complete inflation
insurance.

These observations make clear that what is necessary for
there to exist inflation insurance is someone in the economy who
is willing to bear some part of the risk of inflation at a fair

market price. The natural candidates for doing this would be
people or institutions who are "over—indexed" for inflation.
Feldstein [1983) and Summers [1983] have maintained that
substantial numbers of households at all stages of the life cycle

may find themselves in this position. Fischer [1986] maintains
that many non-financial business firms may be in such a position
too.

7•

private Supply of CPI—Linked Securities

To the extent that the demand for inflation insurance is
small, the existing supply of CPI—linked securities can provide

enough of a hedge asset. But what if the demand should grow in
the future?

One promising source of CR1-linked investments for an
inflation insurance intermediary is CP1-linked hone mortgages.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is
about to certify a variety of price—level-adjusted mortgages

(Pal(s) for Federal Housing Administration approval (FRA). There
is reason to believe that once FHA mortgage insurance is
available and the tax status of PLANs is clarified, they could
account for a significant portion of new lending in the home

Policy Implications
Proposals to index pension benefits and other nominal

annuities in both the private and public sectors have a long

history.'2 In the U.K. the government has gone so far as to
mandate the indexation of the minimum level of employer-provided
pension benefits, and the government of the Province of Ontario,

Canada is on the verge of adopting similar measures.13 The
approach presented in this paper permits fairly precise
quantification of the cost of implementing such proposals.
This approach also gives us a way of estimating the savings
to the Social Security system that would result from introducing

a deductible. Feldstein

3

has advocated limiting the Social

Security cost—of—living adjustment to the excess of the actual

inflation rate over some deductible. Our approach can help to
quantify the savings that would result from any deductible rate
of inflation.

mortgage designs.
