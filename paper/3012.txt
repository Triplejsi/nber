BONUSES, OVERTIME, AND EMPLOYMENT

KOREA VS. JAPAN

ABSTRACT

This paper exanined the bonus and wage behavior in Korea.
We found that both bonuses and wages in Korea respond to economic

conditions much more than their counterparts in Japan.

This

finding may reflect the fact that the Korean labor niarket is niuch

Korean Labor Market: An Overview

The workers' mobility in Korea is currently much higher than that of
Japan. However, the average length of the service, the quit rate (by age and

by size of the firm) and other indicators in the present Korea are quite

High mobility of Korean workers is also documented by Soonkon Kim (1983)
During the 1970s, the separation rate in Korea was on average at 5%, while
it was 1.5% in Japan and a little over 4% in the United States (Kim (1983;

Profit sharing is not at all (except for 6.3%

A decision

for giving bonuses is mainly made unilaterally by the employer (62%), while

some of them (26%) are negotiated at the time of annual labor negotiations
(Ahn (1982; p.251).

If these results are taken at the face value, bonuses are a result of
unilateral benevolence by employers in order to give a supplemental income
to workers who suffer from poor living conditions.

In particular, "profit

sharing" is not at all credited in the literature as a reason of handing out
bonuses.

This description seems to be far from a profit sharing hypothesis

envisioned by Weitzman.

Further Investigations
Labor Market Conditions

(i)

One of the often-heard criticism of the profit-sharing hypothesis, in

particular when the hypothesis

is

empirically applied,

is

that the

hypothesis ignores labor market conditions, which are usually considered
to be central in the wage determination.

in wage (rate) negotiations, but may not be so in the bonus determination.

This finding is a further evidence against a bonus-as-disguised-wage
hypothesis, in that bonuses and base wages are two different things in how
each responds to an economic condition and a labot market condition.
(ii)

Pooled Regression
Since we have used annual data, as Freeman and Weitzman did, the number

of observations is not so large in Korea.

One trick to overcome the problem

of small samples is to use both time-series and cross-section data.

Table

5-2 (A) shows a result of a pooled regression with sectoral and year dummy
variables.

Its panel (A-l) shows a familiar result, that the elasticity of

bonus with respect to an economic condition is greater than that of the
monthly wages.

Therefore, we may conclude that this result is a robust one.

Concluding Remarks

This paper examined the bonus system of Korea in contrast to that of
Japan.

The bonus-wage ratio

in Korea has been increasing rapidly and,

currently, the ratio is about the same as that of Japan in late 1950s.

In Korea, not only bonuses but also monthly wages move procyclically
with economic conditions, so that the bonus-wage ratio does not necessarily
appear

to

be

sensitive

to

economic

conditions.

This

contrasts

to

the

movements of the Japanese bonus/wage ratio and the monthly wage.

One might suspect that the flexible wage in Korea is due to overtime
payments that are included in "monthly wages."

response to economic fluctuations in Korea and in Japan.

When the unemployment rate is added to a list of independent variable,
the wage base is found to be most sensitive to this labor market indicator.
Bonuses and overtime pay tend to be influenced more by economic conditions,
such as net sales and profits, more than the unemployment rate.

Lastly, pooled regressions were conducted to check whether we might
have been misled using small-sample regressions.

The bonus elasticity was

found to be greater than the wage elasticity, a familiar result, even in the
pooled regressions.

Sectoral dummy variables are found to be not common for

all sectors.

Although we investigated the Korean bonus system in various manners,

more questions came up as soon as we solved one question.
topics are left for future research.

The following

Is there any tendency that mobility of

workers has declined due to a development of the bonus system in Korea? How
does the firm adjust overtime, bonuses, and employment?

Does the bonus/wage

ratio in Korea change systematically and significantly with respect to the
length of service and with the size of establishments, as in Japan?

If so,

does the sectoral disparity in the size of the bonus/wage ratio and in the
bonus elasticities reflect any institutional, demographic differences amond

the sectors? In any case, we hope that this paper stimulates more research
on the Korean labor market with comparative perspectives.

Susan Collins

(1988) compared the investment-saving balances of Japan

and Korea, since both countries achieved a rapid economic growth supported
by high investment.

She found that Japan slowed investment when the balance

of payments worsened, avoiding borrowing from abroad, while Korea borrowed
from abroad when the domestic saving dropped below an investment target.

3. However, a question arises with this interpretation.

If subsistency is

the reason, why is there a significant differential between large and small
firms?

Why does the aggregate wage payment increase over time?

I

think

that the finding does not contradict with other possible explanations, for
example a long-term contracting model.

by (share in annual compensation) = (bonus ratio)/(12+bonus ratio)

It has been established that wages in Japan are much more flexible than

wages in the United States; and employment in Japan is much more stable than
that in the United States.

These findings are explained in that Japan needs

wage flexibility in order to keep lifetime employment.

In the spot market both wages and employment respond to

economic conditions.
