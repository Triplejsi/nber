MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS, TRANSFER PRICES, AND TAXES:
EVIDENCE FROM THE U.S. PETROLEUM INDUSTRY

ABSTRACT

transfer-pricing behavior by multinational corporadons has emphasized
theoretical modeling and institutional description. This paper presents the fiit .ystematic empirical
analysL of transfer prices, u.sing data from the petroleum industry. On the basLs of oil imported into
the United States over the period 1973 - 1984, we test two propositions:
Economic research on

I) Are prices set by integrated companies for their internal transfers different from those pre'ailing
in arm 's-length (i.e., inter-company) trade, when other variables, such as oil quality, are controlled
for?
ii) Do average effective corporate income tar rates explain observed patterns of transfer pricing?
Regression analysis leads to the following conclusions:

Transfer and arm 's-length prices differ significantly for oil origznating in some cowthie but not
all. When multiplied by the relevant import volumes, these differences are relatively smalL The
revenue transferred through deviations from ann -length prices represents two percent or les.s of the
value of the caide oil imported by multinational companies each year.

ii) The observed differences between arm 's-length and transfer prices are not easily explained by
average effective tax rates in exporting countries.

Our results provide little support for the claim that multinational petroleum companies set their
transfer prices to evade taxes. We offer several hypotheses to explain our findings

Introduction

Whenever goods cross national borders within the channels of a multinational corporation

(MNC), a trarsfer price must be calculated for tax purposes. When corporate tax rates differ
on the two sides of the border, the MNC has an incentive to set its trarsfer prices in a way so
as to reduce its tax burden by reporting higher profits in the countly where corporate profits are
taxed more lightly.

The ability of MNCs to set transfer prices to minimize taxes, however, is circumscribed by the

tax regulations of the home and host countries. In the United States, Section 482 of the
Internal Revenue Code requires that transfer prices for imports and exports of goods and
services be set equal to 'arm's-length prices.

Defining arm's-length prices' is often non-trivial. Unless the good transferred is perfectly
homogeneous and has a well-functioning arm's-length market, determination of arm's-lengtlf

prices will involve some arbitrariness. The process of determining arm's-length prices in
practice is one of negotiation with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The numerous court
cases involving arm's-length pricing (LaMont 1975) is an indication that the process is not cutand-dried.

Allegation of abues of trarsfer pricing is widespread, where abuse" is very loosely defined as
a divergence between trarsfer prices and some notion of arm's-length prices. These allegations

are supported by some indirect evidence (L.all 1973, Vaitsos 1974, Jenkins and Wright 1975,

Roumeiotis 1977, Bertrand 1981), but there have been no direct comparisons of interaffiliatc
and arm's-length prices. This paper carries out such a study for the U.S. petroleum industry.

The main reason for choosing the petroleum industry is that data are available. The main
limitation in examining this industry is that its tax history, for both purely domestic companies

2

and

multinationals, has been quite different in the United States from that of manufacturing.

Thus one should be extremely cautious in generalizing results from petroleum to other
industries.

Nevertheless, there is much to be said for examining petroleum, quite apart from data
availability. As seen in Table 1, in the last decade for which tax data are available, the oil and

gas industry has accounted for between one-third and two-thirds of US taxable income from

abroad, paid well over half of foreign taxes, and earned a similar fraction of the foreign tax
credits. Roughly speaking, the petroleum industiy from this standpoint is about as large as all

other industries combined.

Table 1 is also useful for obtaining a rough idea of the tax position of the industiy. From

column (5) the average foreign tax rate is vety high, more than double that for other industries,

From column (6) the ratio of the foreign tax credit to US taxable income from abroad is very
close to the US statutory corporate tax rate, suggesting that there was little tax left to be paid at

home. From column (7), whereas other industries were able to utilize almost every dollar of
foreign tax paid to offset US taxes, the petroleum industiy was able to offset only half to three
quarters of its foreign taxes paid. These figures are averages across all countries; as discussed
below, situations vaiy from one country to the next.

The US petroleum industry has been alleged to be a notorious abuser of transfer pricing (see
e.g., U.S. Congress 1977, Bertrand 1981). In addition to purely political considerations, there

are at least three reasons for this. First, until the mid-1970s, US MNCs were permitted by the

IRS to treat virtually all payments to governments for oil abroad as foreign income taxes,
enabling the companies to deduct these costs directly from their US tax liabilities, rather than

from their taxable income.1 Their incentive was thus very strong to make these payments
appear as large as possible.

The second reason is the nature of the petroleum market Crude oil, a raw material, accounts
for most of the petroleum moving in international trade. Until the 1980s, there was virtually no

spot-auction market in crude oil (see Hubbard and Weiner 1989). The arm's-length market
was one of long-term contracts. Crude oil is not a homogeneous product, and contract terms

depend, inter alia, on its sulfur and gravity, size of ship transporting the cargo, and terms of
credit. In addition, as Hines (1988b) points out, the contractual relationship itself can have
value, e.g., in mitigating moral hazard problems (referred to in the contracting literature as
'opportunism;" see Williamson 1975).

Moreover, the market for crude oil is not competitive,

but rather has been dominated by OPEC, a cartel whose power has waxed and waned over

time. Oligopolistic interaction among sellers is likely to lead to varying degrees of freight
absorption in markets with geographically-dispersed production, so that the arm's-length price

will depend on the exporting country and point of destination. In the case of petroleum, the

Atlantic and Pacific markets are particularly likely to differ, because moving the product
between them is quite costly.

The final reason is the sheer size of the industry. While crude oil is not perfectly homogeneous,

it is certainly more homogeneous than other products often cited for transfer-price abuse, e.a.,
pharmaceuticals. The scope for transfer-price manipulation is probably substantially smaller as

a percentage of ann's-length price, but when multiplied by the enormous volume of petroleum
moving in international trade, the revenue transferred, and tax avoided, is potentially great.

Suspicions of tax evasion through transfer-pricing by the industry have not been limited to

researchers and politicians. The US. Internal Revenue Service created a special unit, the

Petroleum Industry Program, in 1978 to monitor the industry, and inter alia, make
determinations regarding arm's-length prices. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
monitored transfer prices in the course of administering the regulatory program imposed on the

7

domestic petroleum industry in the 1970s. This monitoring process is the source of the data

used in this study, which were required to be submitted to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA, the data-collection branch of DOE) by American companies that import
crude oil.

The approach in this paper is as follows. First, we use regression methods to isolate systematic

differences between third-party and interaffiiate prices, controlling for the factors discussed
above. One hypothesis we examine is whether the rise of the spot market and centralization of

IRS petroleum expertise at the end of the 1970s resulted in a reduced scope for creative
transfer-pricing. We then go on to relate these differences to the tax regimes of exporting
countries.

The data were obtained from EIA, which deleted any information that would allow
identification of individual firms. The data are described in some detail in Weiner (1986) and

Anderson (1988);2 the discussion here is limited to attributes salient to this paper. The data

cover the period October 1973 - October 1984, a period that encompasses tremendous
variation in oil prices, changes in the structure of the petroleum industry, and tax rates. The
database contains information on dates of loading and importation, exporting country, port of
landing, f.o.b. and landed prices, sulfur and gravity, credit terms, volume, and transaction type

for cargoes of crude oil imported into the United States during this period.4 While some
previous analysts have concluded that the absence of a "market price" precludes assessment of

transfer-price manipulation (Rugman 1985), we are able to take advantage of this information
in the regression analysis, thereby correcting for much of the heterogeneity discussed above.

8

For our purposes, the most interesting aspect of the database is the breakdown of imports by

type of transaction--interaffiliate transfers (designated type A below) and arm's-length
purchases. The latter is further broken down into purchases directly from host governments
(type H), "third-party' purchases (purchases from other firms, designated type 7), and arm's-

length purchases with type of seller unreported (type U). The decline of the major
multinational oil companies and rise of state enterprises in oil-exporting countries is reflected

in the falling share over timc of interaffiliate transfers relative to arm's-length transactions.
The breakdown of transaction types for purchases from each oil-exporting countly is provided
for an illustrative year in Table 2.

Hypotheses Regarding Transfer Pricing

The hypotheses about transfer-price behavior are straightforward: Multinational petroleum

companies set transfer prices that differ from their arm's-length prices when they have the
incentive and the abifity to do so. Ceteris pan bus, firms that produce crude oil in countries with

effective marginal corporate tax rates (tf) that exceed the rate in the United States (t) will
reduce their tax obligations by reporting transfer prices as low as possible. At the margin the
dollar in profit "lost" in the host country will reduce firms' tax obligations by t, while increasing

their US tax obligation by an amount

<t1. Similarly, when

> tf, firms have an incentive

to report greater profits in the host country, in order for as much of their revenue as possible to
be taxed at the lower rate abroad.

In practice, calculations of tax obligations are complicated by the fact that US MNC's must pay

US corporate tax on income earned by their foreign subsidiaries. In order to avoid double
taxation, the IRS allo US MNC's to credit foreign taxes paid against their US tax obligations.
In terms of this very simple model, the US MNC would owe US tax of tus - tf on the

9

dollar of profit if

>

t. If the foreign rate exceeds the US rate, the US MNC owes no tax to

the United States at the margin.

When

t

> tf, US MNC's nonetheless have an incentive to report profits abroad because the

US tax owed is payable only when the profit is repatriated to the United States. By investing
their profits abroad, US MNC's can thus defer their US tax obligations. When tf exceeds

the difference is an excess foreign tax credit, which the US MNC can carry forward against
future US tax obligations. Thus the incentives for transfer-price manipulation described above
are present even when foreign taxes are creditable against US taxes.4a

Because the comparison we undertake is so straightforward, we do not present a formal
theoretical model of transfer pricing in this paper. A model that integrates some features of
the theoretical literature in this area can be found in Eden (1985), where it is demonstrated
that tariff rates, as well as corporate tax rates, can influence transfer-price decisions. In this
case, the United States has imposed a tariff on crude oil imports since 1973 (when it switched

from a quota). The tariff is very small however ($0.20/barrel, corresponding to a rate of
roughly one percent), and is neglected in our analysis.

Of course, transfer prices serve purposes other than reduction of tax obligations, e.g., providing

signals for managerial incentives within the firm (see Eccles 1985). These other considerations

will confound efforts to examine hypotheses regarding tax factors only if they vary
systematically with tax rates, which appears unlikely.

The scope for multinational firms to set transfer prices so as to minimize their tax obligations is

constrained by the tax regulations of their home and host countries, and by the ability of the tai

authorities to enforce these regulations. In the United States, the relevant regulation is Section

482 of the Internal Revenue Code, which requires that transfer prices be set at arm's-length.
The regulations acknowledge the difficulty often involved in the establishment of arm's-length

prices. Section 482 specifies that if 'comparable' third-party transactions exist, then they must

be used in determining arm's-length prices, Firms have considerable discretion in deciding
what constitutes "comparable,' however. In the event that no comparable transactions exist,
firms are instructed to choose, in descending hierarchy, the "resale price' method (which uses

downs.;am m's-length prices to impute upstream transfer prices), the "cost-plus" method, or
any other pricing method that can be justified to the IRS.5 Using Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) line-of-business data for 1975, Benvignati (1985) estimated that 24 percent of transferprices set for goods exported from the United States to affiliates abroad were established using

the comparable-third-party and resale-price methods, 57 percent using the cost-plus method,

and 19 percent using other methods. Unfortunately, the FTC data do not cover interaffiliate
imports into the United States. In contrast, the breakdown for interaffiliate transfers within the
United States (where tax considerations do not enter) in 1975 was 49 percent comparable-thirdparty and resale-price methods, 29 percent cost-plus method, 22 percent other methods.

'The null hypothesis here is that the US tax authorities are sufficiently knowledgeable about the

arm's-length market in crude oil, and sufficiently capable at enforcing transfer-price
regulations, that MNC's are obliged to set the prices for their interaffiliate transactions equal to

prices prevailing for third-party transactions. As noted above the heterogeneity of the product

and third-party contract terms will tend to complicate efforts to establish arm's-length prices
with which to compare a firm's transfer prices. However, IRS enforcement of the arm's-length

yardstick need not be perfect to deter the practice of using transfer prices to avoid taxes. As
detailed in Robbins and Stobaugh (1973), there are many channels through which MNC's can

shift funds between affiliates besides trade transactions, including dividend payments, loans,
service fees and overhead charges, and royalties. Depending on the costs of doing so, MNC's

12

may choose one or more of these other channels as a means of shifting profits among tax
jurisdictions.

In addition to testing for differences between arm's-length and transfer prices, we examine

below the hypothesis that MNC's transfer funds between tax jurisdictions by charging
themselves above- or below-market rates of interest on their credit transactions. The effective

interest rates charged are imputed from the sensitivity of f.o.b. prices to credit terms. The
higher the effective interest rate, the more should an increase in the number of days credit raise
the purchase price. In other words, the effective interest rate rises with d(price)/d(credit days).

The hypothesis here is that U.S. multinationals would like their affiliates in countries with

relatively low marginal corporate tax rates to "charge' high interest rates on their transfers to

affiliates in countries where such rates are relatively high, thereby transferring income to
jurisdictions where it is taxed more lightly. Effective interest rates are of course unobservable,

but this hypothesis can nonetheless be tested using a two-step procedure similar to the one

mentioned above for prices. The first step is a comparison of regression coefficients for

d(price)/d(credit days) for arm's-length and interaffiliate transactions, in order to locate
significant differences. The second is to relate any such differences to tax rates abroad. If
MNC's are transferring funds in this manner, the correlation between foreign tax rates and

excess" effective interest rates, as measured by d/(price)/d (credit days) jnteraffjljate d(price)/d(credit dayS)11jrdpa, should be negative.

The statistical work below constitutes the first systematic test of the effectiveness of transfer-

price regulations. Scattered indirect evidence suggests that the IRS is active in attempting to
enforce Section 482. Plasschaert (1979) reports that in 1968-69, the IRS investigated 871 cases

of international interaffihiate transactions. The largest number (roughly a third of the total) of

13

potential adjustments concerned transfer prices in trade transactions. Only 26.9 percent of the
adjustments were actually implemented, but those that were implemented involved fairly laige

dollar figures. According to Plasschaert, two-thirds of the firms surveyed by the Conference
Board in 1970 and 1971 has been subject to adjustments under Section 482.

Empirical Tests

Our objectives for the empirical work are three. First, we want to determine whether

interaffiliate prices and third-party prices differ significantly, both in an economic and a
statistical sense, and whether any such differences vary systematically over time. Second, we
wish to identify the exporting countries, if any, that exhibit such differences. Our final desire is
to relate any country-specific differences we find to tax rates in oil-exporting countries.

The approach we adopt is as follows. We conduct OLS regressions with the purchase price as

the dependent variable. Crude oil transactions have traditionally been conducted on an f.o.b.
basis, and with a few exceptions, our purchase price data aie quoted f.o.b. point of export.6 To

control for any systematic differences in prices caused by factors other than the relationship
between parties in the transaction, the following explanatory variables were included: gravity,
sulfur content, size of shipment, and dummy variables for spot transactions, port of entry into
the United States (East and Gulf Coasts, West Coast, Hawaii, Guam, and unknown), and credit
terms.

Separate regressions were run for each yeai, both because the effect of the control variables on
price is likely to vary with changing conditions in the oil market over time, and because we aie

interested in changes over time in differences between third-party and transfer prices, for the
reasons discussed above.7 A dummy variable was used for each loaiing month to control for
intrayear fluctuations in oil prices.

14

To conduct hypothesis tests, we include separate dummy variables for each transaction type
(interaffihiate transfer, third-party purchase, host-government purchase) for each country that

exported crude oil to the United States in a given year.8 We test whether the regression
coefficients for third-party transactions and interaffiliate transfers are equal for each exporting
country. In equation form, the null hypothesis is

- ajj = 0, 1 = 1,

•,

qj

where tj and ajj are

the regression coefficients on the third-party and interaffiliate dummy variables for country i in
the regression for year j, and q is the number of countries that exported crude oil to the United

States in year j through both these transaction types.

The standard technique for testing the null hypothesis that the qj length vector

- aj = 0

is to

construct an F ratio based on the squared errors from the constrained (the constraints being the

equality of all the t and a coefficients) and the unconstrained regressions. Here we instead use

the Bonferroni t test (as described in Savin 1980), which rejects the null hypothesis at the a
level if any of the qj values for the difference in coefficients exceeds the ta critical point in
absolute value. The reasons for using the Bonferroni test are two. First, the standard F test

can reject the null hypothesis at the a level even when none of the

-

coefficients differ

significantly from zero at the a level, a result that is not meaningful here, because we are
prthiarily interested not in whether the restrictions are accepted universally, but rather in where

the violations of these restrictions arise. The second reason is that the Bonferroni test
indicates which of the coefficients in the vector tj - aj cause the rejection of the null hypothesis
when it is rejected, whereas the F test does not.

The difficulty with the Bonferroni test is that the distribution of the test statistic B = malj
is

I

not easily calculated because the f are not independent. It should be intuitively clear,

however, that rejection of the null hypothesis at the

level entails using a critical f value at a

level smaller than a if more than one value is being calculated. Although the exact

15

distribution of B will not in general be known, Savin (1980) shows that using a critical level of

a/qj for the qj individual tj's will result in the test's rejecting the null hypothesis at a level e.9
In this paper we

use

the levels a = .05 and a = .10; our qj's vary from year to year but are

around 20 exporters, so that the individual t-statistics must exceed the critical value (for the
two-tailed test with a large number of degrees of freedom, so that we use the standard normal

distribution to approximate)

separately on the grounds that Canadian crude oil shipments enter

the

United States via pipeline, primarily in the North-Central region (Indiana to Montana), where

there is relatively little immediate competition with other foreign sources of crude oil, which
are shipped by tanker to the U.S. East, West, of Gulf Coastsj0 Otherwise, the same regression
model is applied to Canadian data.

An illustrative example for 1981 of the overall regression results appears in Table 3. The
dummy variables have been chosen so that the constant represents the average price paid to the

Venezuelan government for crude oil shipped to the East coast during the month of January
with zero credit days. API gravity and sulfur content have the expected positive and negative

signs respectively. This result is quite robust over time. Volume or size of shipment displays an

expected negative sign due to size discount, however this result is far from robust as the
coefficients turn out to be significantly positive for a number of years. As expected, the spot

transaction variable yields a mixture of positive and negative signs over the sample period.
Although this is not the case in 1981, oil delivered to the West coast is usually significantly
cheaper than to the East coast due to the aIded cost of moving oil south of Africa, or through
the Panama Canal. The dummy variables for loading month display a pattern of falling prices.

The variable for credit days was introduced in the years for which data are available (1979

to 1984) with the intent of measuring an implicit interest rate across transaction types, as

explained above. Unfortunately no coherent inference can be made, as can be seen from the

1981 result. It was expected that the average purchase price increases with the number of

credit days due to the implicit loan. Furthermore, affiliates may want to charge implicit interest

rates different from market interest rates in order to realize money transfers. Unfortunately,
the data reveal no definite pattern in this respect, although some coefficients of the variables
for credit days are statistically significant.

The last group of explanatory variables is based on transaction type by country. It yields the

annual average price differential associated with the type of transaction. Table 3 shows that
with two exceptions, crude oil sold by the Venezuelan government was the cheapest crude oil

imported into the US. Using the estimated coefficients reported in Table 3 and the
estimated variance-covariance matrix, the average price differential between third-party and
affiliate transactions is calculated for each country along with the pertinent standard error and

t-statistic. The results are reproduced at the bottom of Table 3. A positive value implies that
prices for transactions through afffliates were lower than those for transactions througii third

parties. A negative value implies the converse. Recalling the discussion above, differentials

motivated by tax considerations should be positive. Table 3 shows that the two prices were
statistically different at the 5 percent significance level for Abu Dhabi, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi
Arabia, Trinidad and Venezuela, and at the 10 percent level for Mexico, but that only three of
the significant differentials have the sign predicted by the tax-motivation hypothesis.1 la

Table 4 provides a swnmaiy of the results from the annual regressions. Only the average price

differentials which are statistically significant at the 10 percent level are shown.12 No price

differential is statistically significant in 1983, so the null hypothesis of no difference is not
rejected for that year according to the Bonferroni procedure. The null hypothesis is rejected

for all other years. Countries are separated into two groups with the first including major
exporting countries which contributed 5 percent or more of all US crude oil imports in a
particular year and the second all other smaller oil exporting countries.

If attention is centered on the major oil exporting countries only, it is possible to observe
specific patterns over time and for individual countries. From 1973 to 1975, when major oil

exporting countries had yet to nationalize completely their oil production, all average price
differentials were negative with one exception, Algeria in 1973. From 1982 to 1984, all price
differentials are positive, with Indonesia in 1984 being the single exception. Between these two

periods, the results are mixed. At the individual country level, Indonesia shows negative price

differentials for all years, with 1978 being the only exception. Saudi Arabia has only positive

price differentials, while Venezuela has negative price differentials before nationalization, in

1973 and 1974, and positive price differentials from 1979 to 1984 after nationalization. It

should be pointed out that average price differentials were unusually large in favor of
interaffiliate transactions in 1979.13 This can be explained by the 1979 oil price surge, with
interaffihiate prices being adjusted slowly.

When prices are higher for transactions through affiliates than prices through third parties
(assumed to represent market prices), or in other words, when price differentiais are negative,

money is transferred from the United States to other countries. The converse occurs with
positive price differentials. To get an idea of the relative importance of these money transfers

within affiliated parties, the statistically significant differences in prices reported in Table 4
were multiplied by the number of barrels imported by affiliated parties. The results appear in

Table 5, which also shows the total value of oil imported by affiliated parties and of all oil

imports. With the exception of the first two years and the last one, more money was flowing
into the US than out. The gross money transfer represents less than 2 percent of the value of
crude oil imported into the US by affiliated parties, with 1979 being an exception, and an even
smaller percentage of all crude oil imports.

The database includes information on both the purchase price and the price of oil at the port of

29

ently, the difference being transportation costs. There is no information on the ownership of
tankers (or pipelines) carrying crude oil to the American port of entry, nor is there information
about which countries ultimately received the money spent on transportation. Nevertheless,
transportation fees form another channel which couid be used to transfer money into or out of

the US. th spite of the incomplete information, an analysis similar to that described above for
crude oil prices was applied to transportation costs in order to test whether the latter differ
between third-piate transactions.14
Table 6 displays the summaiy results with respect to differences between transportation costs of

third-party and affiliate transactions. No systematic differences over the years seem evident,
but some individual countries display definite patterns: Algeria (positive), Iran (negative),

Libya (positive), Mexico (positive), Saudi Arabia (negative), Angola (positive), Egypt
(negative), and Norway (positive). Table 7 shows the money transfers that result from affiliates
paying significantly different transportation costs than third parties. These transfers represent
less than one percent of the value of oil imported into the US by affiliated parties.15

Tax effects

As

shown in Table 4 and Table 6, third-party and interaffiliate purchase price and

transportation cost differentials display specific patterns for some countries. What are the
relationships between these estimated patterns and the host countly tax regimes? Oil taxation
in each country of interest arid its evolution over time are highly complex and cannot easily be
summarized in a few general statements.16 Furthermore it is quite difficult to put together a

time. Since our
set of statistical information on this matter which displays consistency over
interest lies in transfer pricing between affiliated parties, our objective is to find an indicator of
the fiscal treatment granted to an additional dollar of oil production income by host countries.

30

The higber is the marginal oil income tax rate, the greater is the incentive to reduce reporteJ

taxable income in a particular country, regardless of whether the marginal tax rate is higher
than the home country (US) tax rate.17 Since marginal tax rates are not reaiily available, we
have to rely on average effective tax rates prevailing abroad. The average effective income tax
rate is defined as the ratio of income tax paid or accrued to taxable income based on measures

which would normally be acceptable to the Interval Revenue Service. The average effective

income tax rate may be a poor indicator of the marginal rate when the latter is increasing
(understatement) or decreasing (overstatement). It is possible to have a situation where the
average tax rate is high and the marginal rate is nil, as was the case when the income tax paid
was based on the posted prices.18

Average effective income tax rates are displayed in Table 8, but should be interpreted with
great care. The main statistical sources are as follows. The tax and income data for even years

up to 1982 are taken from various issues of Statistics of Income put out by IRS; the data for
1977 and 1982 come from the benchmark survey of the US Department of Commerce on US

direct investment abroad. Smith (1987) presents a few figures for 1983, and finally, some
judgment was applied to make interpolations or extrapolations. We are left with a number of
missing observations. The salient feature of the average effective tax rates as shown in Table 8
is that they are high, both in absolute terms, and relative to US statutory mcome tax rates over
the same period. 19 Furthermore, the effective income tax rate of US parents of foreign oil
affiliates, computed in a similar fashion, was 0.30 in 1982 only Mexico was characterized by a

lower figure. No overall time trends are evident; some countries, such as Canada, Egypt, and
Nigeria, display upward trends, while others countries, such as Ecuador, Indonesia and Kuwait,
show downward trends.

What is the relationship between third-party and interaffiliate purchase price and
transportation cost differentials, on the one hand, and the average effective income tax ates

on the other? For purchase price, the transfer-pricing hypothesis states that interaffiliates
would like to set a lower price in high-tax host countries relative to third-party transactions,
hence generating high positive price differentials. As for transportation cost, a high effective

tax rate should induce integrated cornpames to take income out of the oil-producing host
country, possibly into the home countiy, or more likely into a tax-haven countly 'rou flagof-convenience shipping affiliate. This would result in more of the oil acquisition cost being in
the form of transportation cost, and hence increase transportation cost relative to third parties.

Along with these two transfer pricing hypotheses, our objective is to check whether significant

structural breaks occurred between the early part of the sampling period and the latter part,
when a number of oil-producing countries had taken over oil production, and when the iRS
improved its ability to monitor US oil companies operating abroad.

To test for the influence of effective income tax rates on affiliate pricing behavior, and for

possible structura' changes, regressions were run with average effective tax rate as the
explanatory variable, and differentials between third-party and affiliate prices (as shown, e.g., at

the end of table 3) as the dependent variable, for two subperiods, 1975 to 1978 and 1980 to
1984.21 Each observation is weighted by the inverse of the standard error of the estimated

third party/affiliate differential to take into account the precision of the information. Only
observations for which tax rates and estimated price differentials are both available are used.

Table 9 presents the summary regression results. The relationship between the two sets of
variables is at best tenuous. There appears to be no significant relationship between third-party

and affiliate estimated purchase price differentials and average effective income tax rates in

34

both subperiods. Estimated transportation cost differentials, on the other hand, show the
predicted negative relationship with tax rates, significantly so in the first subperiod, and a

weaker relationship in the second one. To probe this relationship further, attention was
centered on the year 1976, which had the most extensive set of information on individualcountry effective oil income-tax rates. Spearman rank correlations between third-party and
affiliate estimated purchase price (transportation cost) differentials and effective income tax

rates22 were computed in an attempt to reduce the influence of measurement :rrors. The
price differential/effective income tax rate rank correlation yields, as predicted, a positive
value, 0.34, with a standard error of 0.23, while the transportation cost/effective income tax rate

rank correlation is, also as predicted, negative, equal to -0.14 with the same standard error.
The first estimated rank correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero at the 10
percent level, while the second is not.23 Taken together, the regression and rank correlation
results provide on'y very weak support for an influence of effective income tax rate on transfer
prices between affiliated parties.

ConchLsion

In eneraI, multinational corporations can reduce their tax obligations by setting transfer prices

thai differ from arm's-length prices. Their ability to do so is constrained by tax regulations in

their home and host countries. The effectiveness of these regulations, however, is not easily
determined.

In this paper, we have conducted the first systematic empirical analysis of transfer prices. The
industry we have studied, petroleum, has a long history of tax-motivated transfer pricing. Even

after the changes in the tax treatment of the industry in the mid-1970s, there have been
allegations of transfer-price abuse, but little in the way of hard evidence.

35

Our findings indicate that there are systematic differences between transfer and arm's-length

prices for many exporting countries. Sortie of these countries exhibit consistent patterns over

time, but others do not. Moreover, the relationship between transfer-price/arm's-length-price

differentials and corporate tax rates appears to be weak. There are at least four possible
hypotheses for this. First, the nature and enforcement of IRS regulations may be so effective

that compallies are precluded frcjm reducing their tax obligations through transfer pricing.

Second, it may be much easier to avoid taxes through the other channels discussed above.
Third, transfer prices may serve a primarily managerial role within the firm, as described by
Eccles (1985) and Robbins and Stobaugh (1973)24 Finally, marginal and average effective tax

rates may be sufficiently different as to prevent identification of any relationship between the

former and transfer-pricing behavior. These hypotheses are not all mutually exclusive, and
untangling theni is urHikely to prove easy. While this study represents a step in the empirica]
analysis of transfer pricing,

t is

dear that much work remains to be done in this area.

NOTES
following
1. Briefly, this practice arose out of U.S. foreign policy goals in the Middle East
World War II. The practice began with the establishment of an income tax on petroleumcompany profiis by Saudi Arabia in 1950. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued a ruling
accepting the. deductibility of this tax against U.S. income ta in 1955. In the 1960s market
prices for crude oil declined, but transfer prices, called poted, or tax-reference, prices (used

in determining petroleum companies taxes paid to oil-producing countries) did not, effective'y
increasing transfers form the U.S. Treasury to foreign governments (for details see U.S.
Coness 1977; for an economic analysis see Jenkins and Wright 1975).
In the rnid1970s foreign crude-oil reserves (except in Canada) were nationalized, limiting the
ability of U.S. multinationals to claim payrnms to foreign governments as creditable against
U.S. income tax. The rules on deductibility of foreign taxes were tightened by the U.S. Tax
Reduction Act of 1975 and Tax Reform Act of 1976. McDaniel and Ault (1977) summarize
these changes.

2. The primary use of the data in Anderson (1988) was to adjust crude oil import prices for
quality. Weiner (1986) used the data to test hypotheses about contracting and spot trading.

36

3.

Reporting of the data by firms that import crude oil into the United States is mandatory

under the U.S. Federal Administration Act (1974) and the U.S. Energy Policy and
Conservation Act (1975), which were part of the basis for U.S. domestic crude oil price
regulation. We were unable to find out whether these data were the same as those reported to
the IRS. However, these regulations did not provide an incentive for misreporting transfer
prices of imported crude oil (see Kalt 1981 for a description and analysis of U.S petroleum
regulation in the 1970s), and it appears unlikely that MNCs maintained separate accounting
systems for the Department of Energy in addition to their tax and managerial systems.

Since the U.S. deregulation of crude oil prices in 1981, the data have been collected for
statistical purposes only. The reporting form was not changed until late 1984, after which the
information we use here was no longer requested.
4.

Firms are not required to report in months in which they import less than 500 thousand

barrels into the United States. In comparison, crude oil imports into the United States
averaged roughly 200 million barrels per month during this period. The database covers
approximately 90 percent of U.S. crude oil imports.

4a. The MNC's US tax credits and liabilities cannot be deferred when its foreign affiJiates are
organized as branches, rather than separately incorporated abroad as subsidiaries. Most US
petroleum MNCs organize their foreign operations as branches, implying that the transfer-price
incentive discussed in the text is relevant only when tf > t. As indicated below, this is always
the case in our data.
5. For

a more detailed description, see Plasschaert (1979).

6. The database contains landed as well as f.o.b. prices. Shipments for which the two prices
were equal were assumed to change hands on a c,i.f. basis, and were not used in the regressions.

7. Shipments that loaded in one year and landed in the next were counted in the loading year.
An alternative to conducting annual regressions would have been to run one regression with
interaction terms to allow for changes over time. The database contains so many observations

(see Table 4) that there is little to be gained form pooling years for additional degrees of
freedom.

8. Not every country exported through every transaction type every year. Dummy variables are
omitted in cases where no transactions from a given country of a given type exist.

37

8a. If the transaction type itself is an endogenous choice based on tax considerations, the
coefficient estimates may be biased. To test for endogeneity, we performed a logit analysis,
using transaction type as the dependent variable, and effective tax rates (described below) as
explanatory variables. The test revealed no significant relationships bet'een transaction type
and country-specific effective tax rates.

Em) 1 - m P(E4),
9. This result comes from applying the Bonferrom inequality P(E1
where Ej stands for event i, and E for the complement of event 1. As an example, suppose
the events E1, E2 are that the t statistics associated with two regression coefficients are in the

acceptance region for the null hypothesis. Then the .05 level test of both being in the
acceptance region is that each is in the .025 acceptance region. In comparison, if the two
statistics are independent, then the exact distribution of B can be calculated; a .025 level test on
each coefficient is equivalent to a 1 - (1 - .025)2 = .0494 level test of the null hypothesis.

10. The null hypothesis that Canadian data fit the overall regression is rejected at conventional
significance levels.

11. The exceptions are China (transaction type I) and Venezuela (transaction type A), but
neither is statistically significant at conventional levels.

ha. It has been suggested that type A prices may follow type H prices closely, which would
indicate that affiliates' prices merely follow those set by their host government. The Bonferroni
test rejects at the five percent level the hypothesis of no price differential between transaction
types A and H.
12. In a dition, the differences that are significantly different from zero at the 5 percent level
are so indicated.
13. Malaysia is the exception.

14. These regressions omit the explanatory variables API gravity, sulfur, and credit days.

15. The result that the United States has received relatively small net inflows differs markedly
from that of Jenkins and Wright (1975) for the period bcfore our data start.

abroad, see Hines (1988a).

18. See U.S. Congress (1977).

19. Average effective tax rates greater than one reflect the fact that the tax base used by the
IRS for foreign operations of U.S. companies differs from the tax base as defmed by other
governments.

21. As can be seen in Table 4, the price differentials for 1979 are very large. This is in part due

to the disruption in the oil market, which resulted in rapid price changes. Since the
differentials were almost certainly affected, we have dropped 1979 from the regressions.

22. Taking into account the standard error of the estimated differentials.

23. The approximate distribution for order statistics suggested by Kendall and Stuart (1960),
section 31.19, is used to obtain the critical value.
24. This hypothesis requires the additional, questionable assumption that it is too costly for the
MNC to maintain separate accounting systems for managerial and tax purposes.
