RISK NEUTRALITY

TWO-TIER FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET:
EVIDENCE FROM BEL.GIUN

AND THE

ABSTRACT

Most of the literature on two-tier exchange markets is built around models in which domestic policy
can exert a powerful influence on the spread between the current account exchange rate and the

capital account exchange rate. We show that if optimizing agents are risk neua1, domestic policy

has no significant influence on the spread. Our work with Belgian data suggests that a nsk neuual
specification for Belgian residents acting in the two-tier market is hard to reject, and we also find
evidence that domestic variables do not affect the Belgian spread.

Introduction

Many countries have experimented with separate exchange markets for
current account and capital account transactions as a way to deal with
possibly volatile capital flows and to insulate goods-market transactions
from capital-market disturbances.

Such a regime, knowrL as a dual, or two-

tier, exchange market, has been in place in the Belgium-Luxembourg
Economic Union since 1956 and was adopted in modified form by France and
Italy during the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system.

The strategy of

separating exchange market transactions by type of transaction has also

been tried periodically by other developed countries and has been recently
used by several Latin American countries. j/
There have been many theoretical studies of two-tier markets.

These

range from Fleming's (1971) seminal piece to more recent work that
examines the two-tier market within an explicit utility-maximizing
framework. 2/

Yet there have been practically no rigorous tests of the

theories. 3/

One reason for the absence of empirical work is the transitional
nature of most two-tier regimes.

Most data sets are either too short for

time-series econometric procedures or agents' beliefs about the
temporariness of the regime build into the data elements that are very
difficult to model either in time series or in cross section.

A second

See Lanyi (1975) for a summary of two-tier exchange markets in the
j/
1970s and Kiguel (1988) or Dornbusch (1986) for details of the more
recently adopted regimes.
For example, see Obstfeld (1986), Adams and Greenwood (1985),

Kaminsky (1987), Frenkel and Razin (1986), and Tornell (1988).
Some empirical work has been done by Phylaktis (1988) and Gros

/

(1988).

-2reason is that the countries adopting two-tier markets are seldom among
the more sophisticated in data collection.
Belgium, however, presents neither problem.

It has been operating

its two-tier exchange market for over 30 years and it has a well
developed data base.

To begin checking our theories for consistency with

the data, we start by looking at the Belgian experience.

While Belgium's

long and continuous experience with two-tier exchange rates may also be
contaminated by agents' beliefs in the temporariness of the regime,
particularly after the commitment to create a single European market by
1992, our a priori belief is that the level of such contamination is less
serious in a longer experience than in shorter ones.
The paper will proceed as follows.

In Section II we develop an

explicit utility-maximizing model of the two-tier market.

In Section III

we use Hansen's (1982) General Method of Moments estimator to explore the
adequacy of a risk neutral utility function for modeling agent's choices
in the Belgian data.

In Section IV we impose theoretical restrictions on

the agent's Euler equation in light of our empirical findings.

After some

simple manipulations of the amended Euler equation, the theory yields a
powerful prediction.

For a small country, the spread should be invariant

with respect to domestic exogenous variables. Many standard explanatory
variables in previous theoretical work, such as Belgian fiscal, monetary
or output variables, should have no impact on the spread.

The Model

Consider a representative agent living in a country that operates a
two-tier exchange market.

In order to purchase a security denominated in

foreign currency, the agent abstains from consumption today, using the
freed resources to purchase the security at its world price converted to
domestic currency units at the capital account exchange rate.

After

holding the security for one period, the interest is repatriated at the
current account rate and the principal at the capital account rate.

Both

of these elements of return enable the agent to augment consumption next
period or in some future period.

The agents welfare is maximized when

the marginal disutility from foregoing current consumption is equal to the
expected present value of the marginal utility of the future consumption
the agent may enjoy as a result of his asset purchase.
Let us place the agent in a very simple setting in which

addition, 8t represents net domestic holdings of foreign currency
denominated bonds at the start of period t

and X and S are respectively

the exchange rates for capital and current account transactions (domestic
currency/foreign currency).

There is no a priori assumption about whether

the current account rate is pegged or not.

Finally, y is domestic output,

P is the domestic price level, and i* is the nominal interest rate on
foreign currency denominated bonds.

The home country is small so that it

takes the foreign interest rate as exogenous.

In each period the agent purchases an amount of bonds that will
maximize his utility.

Specification Tests

In this section, we conjecture that Belgian agents are risk neutral
and we use Belgian data in an attempt to reject this hypothesis.

Note

that if Belgian residents are risk neutral, the marginal utility of
consumption is constant across time and is known to all agents.

Hence,

the marginal utility terms divide out of each side of equation (1) to
yield, with some rearrangement:

alter the form of equation (1).

denomination of the foreign security, we let any "foreign" variables be

We follow convention and generally choose as instrumental variables a
constant and a lagged value of the return variable or components of the
lagged return since values dated t and earlier are not correlated with the
disturbance under the null hypothesis.

A Theory of the Two-Tter Exchange Under Risk Neutrality

Since we are unable to reject the hypothesis that Belgian agents are
risk neutral, we make the representative agent's first order condition
consistent with this hypothesis.

We also proceed with three simplifying

assumptions which will be relaxed later:

There are no inter-market foreign exchange leakages.

(A2)

The two-tier regime is expected to be permanent.

Purchasing power parity (PPP) holds at the current account

Under

these assumptions, the first order condition in equation (1.) becomes

as in Sargent (1979) to obtain a

measure of the spread (actually one plus the spread) between the capital
account exchange rate and the current account exchange rate:

(6)

We observe that the spread depends only on foreign variables and not on
any domestic variables.

Moreover, this proposition is invariant to fixing

or floating the current account rate.

According to equation (I) and (Al)-(A3), domestic variables affect
the spread through their influence on the expected product of
U'(ct+l)/U'(ct), the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution in
consumption, and the return to domestic agents from holding foreign
currency denominated securities.

When we assume that agents are risk

neutral, we make the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution a
policy-invariant constant (unity) and remove the predictions of systematic
correlations between the domestic policy variables and the spread.
theoretical work to date on two-tier markets brings domestic policy
variables to bear on the spread implicitly by influencing the above
correlation.

The

Before examining how well the model predicts the determinants of the
spread, it would be useful to address the appropriateness of the three
assumptions (Al)-(A3).

Predictions were derived assuming no cross-market foreign exchange
leakages (Al).

In practice, however, some purchases and sales of foreign

bonds may be conducted using the current account exchange rate and some
repatriation of interest income may be made using the capital account
rate.

Such leakages may be officially sanctioned or fraudulently

undertaken.

We tried to estimate a modified Euler equation with leakages

parameterized linearly (i.e., only some fraction of the flow goes through
the appropriate exchange market).

Unfortunately, we were unable to find

precise and plausible estimates for the leakage parameters and so decided
to abandon the strategy.

Leakages can provide an alternative explanation

It may well be the case that intermarket leakages

are so fast and so strong that any spreads that do develop are usually
corrected by the end of the month.

However, the data is not sampled

finely enough to test this alternative explanation. 1/
The predictions were also generated assuming that agents expect the

two-tier exchange market to be permanent (A2).

Since the Belgian two-tier

market has been in operation for over 30 years, this assumption seems
plausible.

However, there is no easy way to test whether such an

In Section VI, we investigate theoretically the

implications for the spread when agents believe that the two-tier market
is temporary.

Finally, the predictions about the spread were generated by invoking
purchasing power parity (A3).

We decided to introduce PPP into the

estimates of the Euler equation to check how well this assumption held up
for Belgian data.

Next we investigated the realism of the PPP assumption using
quarterly data.

Specifications (3)-(ll) report the results.

The PPP

assumption turns out to be quite unrealistic when the sample period runs
through 1988 IV.

a 0.0043 probability that the null cannot be rejected.

Since we are not entirely comfortable with the FF1' assumption, we

assume that the period utility function is additively separable in these
categories, then the agent's problem becomes:

Since we were concerned that the regression might be capturing a few
big changes in the U.S. interest rate in the 1980s, we decided to rerun
the regression with observations running only to 1972 I.

Equation (2)

indicates that the U.S. interest rate is still a significant explanatory
variable.

Several aspects of the regressions deserve additional comment.
First, the U.S. interest rate and U.S. price term are added separately
since there is no reason to believe that they are driven by the same timeseries process.

Second, we settled on using the U.S. whol.esale price

disaggregated category of traded goods since the IFS tape does not provide
the latter and our belief was that commodity arbitrage might hold up
better for the WPI than for the GPI.

Perhaps the U.S. price term might

have been significant had we used a better proxy.

Third, Belgian

industrial production rather than Belgian CNP was used as an explanatory
variable since quarterly GNP figures were not available on the IFS tape.
Finally, Belgian money rather than Belgian domestic credit was used as an
independent variable because there is reason to think that domestic credit
was not an exogenous variable during the sample period.

The Belgian

monetary authority may have been sterilizing reserve movements during the
sample period.

Extensions

Inter-Market Leakages

It is widely acknowledged that it is virtually impossible to maintain
complete separation of the two exchange markets depending on the source or
use of the foreign exchange.

Nevertheless, because of analytical

complexities, the number of studies that incorporate leakages has been
quite small. j/

The purpose of this extension is to investigate the

effects of intermarket leakages on the simplicity of our results.
With leakages, the agent's budget constraint needs to be modified to:

Equation (10) is now a first order

nonlinear stochastic difference equation in Xt/St, with only foreign

(Unless A — 0, an explicit solution

requires solving a stochastic nonlinear difference equation, which we
avoid.)

Therefore, for constant 6, A, and a the ratio Xt/St will depend

only on foreign variables but possibly in a complicated way.
Next assume that the leakage parameters depend only on the spread.
The basic point remains.

Our point is not to prove that domestic variables cannot

Rather it is to see how much of a two-tier market theory we can

build without attaching importance to domestic variables.
The leakages we have considered seem broad enough to encompass most
two-tier regimes in practice.

For example, a regime in which all interest

income is repatriated through the capital account is obtained by setting

agents would realize that they would never be allowed to consume the
interest earning on their foreign assets.

The agents would not pay a

positive amount for assets with a zero return and they would not price
capital account foreign exchange.

Regime Temporariness
All exchange rate regimes, indeed all government policies, are
expected by agents living under the regime to be abandoned some day when
circumstances dictate that government attention be otherwise directed.
Let us suppose that agents living under a two-tier market anticipate the
possible future demise of the regime.

Suppose further, for concreteness,

that they anticipate that if the two-tier regime is abandoned the
government will adopt a uniform float.

foreign-denominated assets becomes a probability-weighted average of the
two-tier market expected return and the uniform float expected return.

/ See Dornbusch (1986) and Frenkel and Razin (1986).

-

-

The important point is that the return now contains the time-varying

probability of regime demise.

This probability can depend on any domestic

or foreign aspects of the state.

Only if the probability of a regime

switch does not depend on the domestic state will domestic variables be
unimportant in explaining the spread.

Treating seriously the transitory

nature of two-tier regimes established in the l9BOs will require taking a
stand on the determinants of such probabilities.
Concluding Remarks

Most of the two-tier market literature is built around models in
which domestic policy can exert a powerful influence on the spread between
the current account exchange rate and the capital account exchange rate.
However, if optimizing agents are risk neutral (or if government policy
does not much influence the consumption stream) , domestic policy has no

significant influence on the spread.

Our work with Belgian data suggests

that a risk neutral specification for Belgian residents acting in the twotier market is hard to reject.

We further find some supporting evidence

for risk neutrality when we examine the implication of risk neutrality,
namely that domestic variables should not influence the spread.
We are aware of the assertion (Cros (19BB)) that realignments of the
Belgian current account franc within the European Monetary System have had
an impact on the Belgian spread.

An alternative explanation, consistent

with our work, is that these realignments were correlated with changes in
the 11.5. interest rate, and it was really the latter that influenced the
spread.

We also offer a word of caution.

The Belgian experience does not

necessarily carry over to other countries, particularly developing

-

countries,

20

-

thst impose two-tier exchsnge msrkets.

We hsve no evidence on

the appropriate utility function for agents operating in these countries.
Moreover, factors such as regime temporariness, the inflation tax and
controlled access to one or both foreign exchange markets may be important
in explaining the spread in these other two-tier exchange markets.

Numbers in parentheses are T-statistics.
The price ratio in the regression is the inverse of the price ratio in
the euler equation, so we would expect a negative coefficient in the
regression.
Both regressions have been corrected for first order seriel
