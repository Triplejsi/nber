MARKET WORK, WAGES, AND MEN'S HEALTH

ABSTRPI

In

this paper, we investigate the complex interrelationships

among worktime, wages and health identified in the Grossman model
of the demand for health.

We specify a 3-equation simultaneous

model designed to capture the tune dependent character of

these

interrelationships, and estimate the model using 8 years of panel
data on 882 males aged 22 to 71.

The model is estimated using

Hansen's generalized methods of moments imposing a weak set of
conditions on the error tenn covariance structure.

Using our

data, we estimate simpler models with more restrictive

assumptions commonly found in the literature, and find
substantial differences between these estimates and those

For example, the positive relationship

between worktimne and health found in other studies disappears

when the relevant simultaneities are accounted for.

Our

simultaneous estimates also suggest that worktime spent in
environmentally adverse conditions are inversely related to
health status, while job related physical exercise retards health
deterioration.

INTRODUCTION

The past two decades have witnessed important and puzzling changes
in the reported health status of males.

While age adjusted mortality

rates have fallen, self-reports of poor health and disability have
increased.

Numerous speculations, drawn from various disciplines, have sought
to explain the determinants of health status and changes in it.

In the

economics literature, the limited empirical analysis derives from the
theoretical work of Grossman (1972a; 1972b), and focuses on the
relationships among wages, worktime, and health.

In this model, health

is viewed as an endogenously determined capital stock, and changes in it
as depending on: 1) the exogenous effects of health depreciation related
to age (and intensity of use of health stock, see Muuririen 1982), 2)

individual investments in health improvement (e.g.. preventive medical
care), and 3) individual decisions regarding time allocations (e.g.,
worktime, leisure, exercise).

The benefits of health capital are

2

increased time available for productive activities and direct increases
in utility from less pain and suffering.

Work to date has analyzed each

of these gains independent from its alternative.

The investment or

productive benefit has received the most attention.

Wages play an important role in the investment version of the
Grossman model.

Higher wages lead to a proportional increase in the

marginal return to health, and at the same time increase the cost of
ow-ri-time health investments.

However, because the production of health

involves both time and market work, the marginal return to health
investments rises with wages, as does the optimal quantity of health.1

Simultaneously, better health increases the time available for work and,
hence, labor supply.

While worktime is dependent on both wages and health, it may have
its ow-ri effect on these variables.

Worktime beyond the norm may carry

with it stress factors that increase the health deterioration factor.
Particular conditions at the workplace, such as a hazardous work
erivirorunent, may also influence health deterioration.

Conversely,

regular attachment to the work place and the psychological support that
it provides are often viewed as retarding health deterioration.

Worktime, likewise, embodies experience and on-the-job training, and is
associated with higher wages.

In this paper, we attempt to advance understanding of the structure
of the complex interrelationships between economic phenomena- -worktime
and wages- -and health.

While we build on extant empirical work on this

issue, we carry the analysis forward in a number of dimensions.

First,

we specify a 3-equation simultaneous model, designed to capture the

interrelationships among these phenomena.

model using individual longitudinal micro-data on 882 men observed for 8
consecutive years, yielding over 7000 observations.

structure of the system and allowing simultaneous estimation of the
three structural equations.

Section 2. of the paper briefly reviews previous attempts to
measure the relationships among economic variables and health,
emphasizing the shortcomings of these studies.

Section 3. presents our

model, and describes the estimation technique that we employ.

In

section 4., our data and the variables used in the estimation are
described.

The results of our estimation are presented and interpreted

in section 5.

Because of the complexity of the relationships among the

three variables of interest, we indicate the differences in results

between our simultaneous model and alternative research studies which
fail to capture the full interdependence and impose unrealistic
restrictions on the estimation.

This is done in section 6.

Finally,

section 7. concludes.

WORK, WAGES AND HEALTH:

A BPIEF REVIEW

Following the 1972 study by Grossman, several investigators have
attempted to measure the interdependent relationships at issue.

Luft

(1972), Grossman and Benham (1974), and Bartel and Taubman (1979) all
focussed on the relationship of labor force participation and health.

This work suggests that poor health in period t-l reduces both labor

indicate the need to distinguish carefully the effect of prior health on
work time and wages and the independent effect of worktime, wages, and
health in an earlier period on health in a later period.

The Grossman-

Benham paper, in particular, emphasized the need for a model which views
'observed wage rates, hours of work and health [as reflecting] a set of
interrelated decisions made by the household."

A few studies have analyzed the determinants of health, focussing
on the role of education.

Taubman and Rosen (1982) modeled changes in

the subjectively-reported health of white men, exploiting the
longitudinal nature of the Retirement History Survey.

Education was

found to be positively related to health, and was robust, even when a

variety of other variables expected to be related to health are
controlled for.

While this result is consistent with the indication in

Auster, Leveson and Sarachek (1969) and Kemna (1987) that schooling has

an important impact on health, even after controlling for income, and
occupation (Kemna), it is likely to be partly attributable to the

absence of a full simultaneous equations estimation framework accounting
for the interdependence of work, wages, and health.

Both Grossman

(1976) and Lee (1982) have shown that when health and wages are

estimated simultaneously, the independent impact of education on health
is substantially reduced.

S

Lee (1982) and Wagstaff (1986) have pursued the worktime-.wages-

health interaction most extensively in the context of the theoretical
framework of health capital developed by Grossman.

The former of these

studies estimated the simultaneous effects of health and wages in a
structural equations framework, and accounted for the unobservable
nature of health capital and the discrete nature of health indicators.
Using a sample of older male workers, Lee concluded that wages and
health capital are strongly jointly dependent- -that wages exert a

positive and significant influence on the demand for health, and that
good health increases wages.

In both cases, the relationships are

significant.

Wagstaff emphasizes the different implications of both the
investment and consumption variants of Grossman's model.

In Wagstaff's

estimations, wages are not part of a simultaneous model, but are
estimated using an auxiliary equation.

Ill-health is found to

negatively influence wages. In both the investment and the consumption
structural models, health is treated as an unobservable; wages are found
to have a positive association with health, while job characteristics
(e.g., temperature, mentally and physically demanding work) have

negative associations with health, except (surprisingly) for hazardous
substances

2

These studies, then, have established preliminary estimates of some
of the relevant relationships implicit in the Grossman model of health
as capital.

They have also emphasized the interdependence of decisions

regarding health capital and those pertaining to a variety of other
economic choices, especially work effort and individual productivity

are based on a simultaneous model, reflect the imposition of a weak set
of conditions on the system's error term structure, and exploit
longitudinal data, they continue to be limited by the relatively
imprecise and self-reported measure of health and potential problems of
selectivity.

The variables used in the study and relevant summary

statistics on each are found in Appendix A. The age range of men in the
sample is 22 to 71; the range of annual hours worked is 0 Co 5496.
The variable used to measure individual health is a self-reported
measure based on two survey questions:

"Do you have a physical or

nervous condition that limits the type of work or the amount of work you
can do?"

Then if the respondent answers yes, he is asked:

"Does it

[the condition} limit your work a lot, somewhat, or just a little."

As

the responses range from 0 (no condition) to 3 (condition limits "a
lot"), the health variable reflects the intensity of health limitations.

We note that the loss of estimator efficiency resulting from the
categorical health measure is at least partially offset by the panel
nature of the data set, and by the large sample size. It is assumed that
this indicator is an objective measure of health capital, and hence is
a
determinant of economic productivity.

Although self-reported responses

have been asserted to reflect ambition or labor market success, the
literature suggests that such measures are reliable indicators of health
capital [see Kemna (1987); Leigh (1983); Grossman (1972); and Taubman
and Rosen (1982)1.

The unobserved health

variable employed in the Wagstaff estimate is increasing in good health.
His results indicate that years of education is positively related to
health, a result consistent with our results and nearly all other
estimates of the determinants of health status.

Recent education and

education is similarly positively associated with health status, but the
relationship is not significant.

Age is negacively related to health,

and is the most significant of the Wagstaff variables.

The number of

Job tenure is positively

CONCLUSION

We have addressed the question of the demand for health in the
contexc of Grossman's theoretic model.

As in his framework, worktime

and wages are viewed as interdependent with health status.

Recognizing

this interdependence, we have developed a simultaneous model with an
error term covariance structure with few rescrictions, designed
capture the relationships involved,

to

This model was estimated using a

rich data set involving 8 years of panel data on each of 882 men.
Hence, we are able to capture the time dependent nature of the
relationship among these variables.

Our baseline model (column 1, Table 1) reveals the complexity of
these interrelationships.

While some of the relationships found in

other studies (e.g., the positive and significant relationship between
health limitations and both age and divorce or marital separation, and a
negative relationship between education and health limitations) are
verified, others (e.g., a positive and significant relationship between
worktime and health limitations) are found to be nonexistent.

judge that the implicit demand for health function shown in Table 1

is

the only available estimate that accounts for the interrelationships
among health, worictime, and wages that are so emphasized in the Grossman
model.

In addition to the estimated relationships

themselves, we have

demonstrated the necessity of a simultaneous estimation framework in
order to obtain reliable estimates of the relationships of interest

within the healthworktime-wages nexus.

The substantial differences in

the estimated coefficients and their significance between our

simultaneous 0MM model and its restrictive single equation counterpart
indicates the need for such estimation.

Further verification of this

proposition comes from our replication of the results of a recently
published health demand function, and our estimation of this same
function in a simultaneous model.

The numerous sign and significance level changes associated with
the move from a restrictive to a simultaneous 0MM estimation indicates
the fragility and potential bias Lncorporated in estimates
the mutual interdependence of health, worktirne and wages.

22

Notes

11n the consumption version of the Grossman models or in a mixed

consumption-investment model, the impact of wages on health is
ambiguous.

2wagstaff notes that "the results [indicating that the coefficients

are not reliable estimates) might stem from a failure to estimate a
system of structural demand equations for health inputs" (emphasis his,

p. 226), and "One might also question the accuracy of the structural
parameter estimates on the grounds that the error terms have not been
allowed to covary." (p.228)

3A model that included wages in the health equation was also
estimated and their results are described below.

The overall fit of

this model is weaker than our preferred estimates.
4The rationale for this is the so-called healthy worker effect. It
is hypothesized that workers who are ill value health more highly and so
avoid hazardous work and that those most affected by hazards leave the
job earlier than those least affected.

This argues for a non-linear

relationship between duration of exposure to work hazards and health.

Kemna estimates an increasing negative effect of hazards on health
through five years in an occupation and then a decrease, so that the
effect at 10 years is the same as the initial level (p.199).
5The parameter estimates of each of the just-identified equations
set k (the number of parameters per equation) linear combinations of the
r (the number of orthogonality conditions) equal to zero.

Consider the

23

simultaneous equation framework where r —

÷ r2 ÷ r3 and K —

If there are more instruments for each equation than parameter

estimates, (ri >

for i —

1,2,3),

then there will be r

-

k linearly

independent combinations of the orthogonality conditions which equal

zero oniyin the limit.

These overidentification restrictions imply the

sample inner products of instruments and residuals from one equation
interact with those of other equations in helping to determine all
parameter estimates and standard errors.

Under the null hypothesis that

the overidentification restrictions are true, the minimized value of the
CMM objective function (times the number of observations)
chi-squared with r-k degrees of freedom.

is distributed

The p-value for this statistic

is reported in the last row of Table I.

61n the GMM framework, multiple-equation estimates will differ from

their

single-equation counterparts because of the non-zero sample

products of instruments from one equation with disturbances from
another.

Suppose the disturbance terms of both the health and worktime

equations include the omitted variable "constitution

implying that the

health equation worktime parameter estimate reported in column 2 of
Table 1 is inconsistent due to covariance between the explanatory
variable and error term.

Controlling for the impact of health on

worktinie addresses this source of single-equation estimation bias

resulting from cross-equation error term covariance.
7A possible explanation of the estimated positive relationship

between worktime and health in the single equation model may be that
healthier persons work more.

In a single equation estimate, this

24

relationship would lead to estimation of a positive worktime-health
relationship. The underlying structure would not be that more worktirne

leads to better health, but simply that those in better health are able
to work more than those in poorer health. Including in the estimation
the latter relationship- -which is at the heart of the investment

component of Grossman's model--requires a simultaneous model of worktirne
and health.

In such a model, the observed positive association is

obviated.

8Lee's model, however, did not include worktime, was restricted to
men 45-59, and used cross-sectional data (for 1966).
9The just-identified CMI'! coefficient estimates will be identical to

the linear regression estimates, but calculation of standard errors of
the former include weighting matrices that account for the nonspherical
covariance matrix.

101n addition, in unreported estimates, wages were included in the
full model health equation.

Higher wages were associated with better

health, but the relationship was small and insignificant.

Moreover, the

standard errors of the age and workplace environment variables increased
substantially and the overall fit of model was poorer.

This result is

probably caused by a higher correlation of the instrument-residual inner
products from the health and wage equations with the inclusion of wages
in the health equation.

11Wagstaff estimated both an investment model and a consumption
model to compare the estimates under the two specifications.

The

consumption model is not used for comparison with the model estimated in

25

this paper for it includes expected lifetime hourly wage, estimated from
an auxiliary equation, and initial assets, also estimated from an
auxiliary equation, neither of which are available with our data set.
Furthermore, comparison of his two sets of results shows that including
initial assets and lifetime wage alters the estimated impact of

education from a positive association with health to an unexpected
negative association.

Wagstaff discusses the resulting problems with

multicollinearity on p. 223 of his paper--including that the iterations
in the computer program did not converge with the inclusion of initial
assets and lifetime wage.
12Wagscaff's empirical model is based on a simultaneous equation

framework which includes demand for medical care equations.

Wagstaff

notes that his results might be altered by joint estimation of his extca
equations.

While the underlying Grossman model includes worktime and

wages, worktime is not endogenous to the Wagscaff model because
household production is homogenous of degree one, and wages are assumed
exogenous.

13The explanatory and instrumental variables for the workhours and

wage equations are identical to those of the model reported in column 1
of Table 1.

In addition to the 12 instruments used in the Table 1

three-equation model, the health equation instruments used for these

estimates include the square of the air pollution measure, and the cubes
of wife's age, father's education, and wife's education.
