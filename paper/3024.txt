COLLATERAL, RATIONING, AND GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN CREDIT MARKETS

ABSTRAfl

This paper analyzes the effects of government intervention in credit
markets when lenders use collateral, interest, and the probability of
granting a loan as potential screening devices.
rationing are examined.

Equilibria with and without

The principal theme is that credit policies operate

through their effect on the incentive compatibility constraint, which
inhibits high-risk borrowers from mimicking the behavior of low-risk
borrowers.

Any policy that loosens (tightens) the constraint raises

(reduces) efficiency.

Most government credit programs explicitly attempt to fund investors
that cannot obtain private financing.

In the model presented here, these

subsidies increase the extent of rationing and reduce efficiency.

In

contrast, policies that subsidize the nonrationed borrowers, or all
borrowers, are efficiency enhancing, and reduce the extent of rationing.

Introduction
The federal government is the largest single lender in the country.

As

of the end of 1988, direct loans outstanding exceeded $222 billion, while
outstanding loan guarantees were approximately $550 billion (Office of Management and Budget 1989) .

Federal credit assists borrowers across a wide

variety of sectors, including housing, agriculture, small business, and

education, in a bewildering array of over 100 programs)
In order to analyze the effects of these policies, this paper focuses
on two salient characteristics of virtually all credit programs.

First,

federal credit is usually intended for those who could not obtain private
financing.

For example, "a direct loan is best justified when the federal

objective could not be met with financing from private sources
Management and Budget, 1988, p. F-15).

(Office of

Other programs, such as Small

Business Administration loan guarantees, reauire applicants to prove that
they could not obtain private financing.

Second, federal credit is provided on easier terms than comparable
private credit.

These terms can include reduced interest or collateral,

longer maturities, grace periods, etc.

These provisions are estimated to

reduce the discounted value of borrower payments by amounts that vary widely
across programs, but typically range between 10% and 25% (Office of
Management and Budget 1989).

This paper analyzes the effects of policies with these characteristics
in a model where rationing arises endogenously.2

The underlying model is

2

described in Section 2 and is closely related to Rothschild and Stiglitz
(1976) and Besanko and Thakor (1987).

Investors are divided into two

groups, high-risk and low-risk, and have a choice of investing in a safe
project, or borrowing to invest in a risky project.

For each group, lenders

specify a probability of issuing a loan, an interest rate, and a collateral
requirement.

Any given amount of collateral is assumed to be worth less to lenders
than to borrowers.

This feature implies that the use of collateral will

generate an efficiency loss.

In addition, all projects have expected gross

returns greater than their social opportunity cost.

Therefore, any amount

of rationing represents an additional efficiency loss.

The full information

equilibrium arises when borrower type is known ex ante, and implies no
rationing and no collateral, and is thus efficient.

Section 3 analyzes situations where each borrower's type is private
information.

Now, lenders must collectively offer sets of contracts that

induce borrowers to self-select into the appropriate contract.

In equilib-

rium, high-risks choose a contract with a relatively high interest rate and
a zero collateral requirement.

Low-risks signal their type by choosing to

pay high collateral in exchange for a lower interest rate.

As long as low-

risks have sufficient wealth to post as collateral, the equilibrium involves
no rationing.

Nevertheless, because of the efficiency loss created by the

use of collateral, there is a potential role for government.
The principal result of this section is to show that credit policies
operate through their effects on the incentive compatibility constraint,
which constrains the set of adinissable contracts such that high-risk

borrowers do not apply for the low-risk contract.

In contrast, a guarantee to high-risk borrowers makes the high-risk

Consequently, guarantees to high-risks raise

Equal guarantees to both groups have similar negative effects

on the collateral requirement and positive effects on efficiency.
The major results of the paper are presented in Section 4, where it is
assumed that borrower wealth is too low to support the collateral requirement in Section 3.
it does not change.

Because the high-risk contract involves no collateral,
However, since low-risks can only post a small amount

of collateral, the low-risk contract must somehow be made less desirable in
order to restore incentive compatibility.

The only option is to reduce the

probability of granting a low-risk loan; that is, to introduce rationing of
low-risk borrowers

With the existence of rationing, it is now possible to analyze credit
policies with the two salient features described above.

Suppose the govern-

ment agrees to offer subsidized credit (either direct or guaranteed loans)
to some proportion of the (low-risk) borrowers who are turned down by the
private market.

The key point is that in the absence of any further

changes, these subsidies make the low-risk contract more attractive to highrisk borrowers.

Therefore, some other aspect of the low-risk contract must

become less desirable to restore incentive compatibility.

Since the

collateral requirement cannot rise, the only alternative is for the overall
(public and private) probability of obtaining a loan to fall.

increased subsidies to the rationed borrowers

That is,

the extent of rationing.

Private lending is crowded out on a more than one-to-one basia.

It ahould

be emphasized that this is an equilibrium response, and is due to the
existence of the incentive compatibility constraint.
Although the subsidies increase the extent of rationing, they raise the
cx ante expected utility of low-risk borrowers.

This occurs because the

benefits of the added cheap government loans outweigh the costs of the increased probability of being rationed.

Thus, subsidies to low-risks make

the representative low-risk borrower better off cx ante, but actually reduce
the utility of some low-risk borrowers cx post.

Since they increase the

extent of rationing, the subsidies to low-risk borrowers reduce overall
efficiency.

In contrast, subsidies to high-risk borrowers loosen the incentive
compatibility conatraint.

As a consequence, the extent of rationing of low-

risk borrowers falls and efficiency rises.
Section 5 is a short conclusion.

The Appendix provides derivation of

the various equilibria and proofs of the propositions.

The Basic Model

A.

Description
The model describes a competitive credit market with many investors,

but even more lenders.

All agents are assumed to be risk-neutral, thus

eliminating any insurance role for federal credit, and there is no aggregate
risk.

Investors can invest their initial endowment in a safe project that
yields a gross return of

Z.4

Alternatively, each investor can borrow $1

and invest that and the initial endowment in a risky project.

fall into two categories, which differ according to the probability of

Government Credit
Although there is no rationing in the above model, there is still a

role for government policy due to the efficiency losses created by the use
of collateral.

Conclus ion

This paper analyzes the effects of credit subsidies in markets
characterized by adverse selection.

The principal result is that the

effects of credit subsidies depend on how eligibility is determined.
Programs that subsidize the unrationed contract will reduce the extent of
rationing and raise overall efficiency.

In contrast, programs that target

borrowers who cannot obtain private financing raise the extent of rationing
and reduce efficiency.

The distinction is important precisely because most

government credit is designed to provide funds to those who do not receive
private loans. In the model presented here, such policies raise the extent
of rationing and create inherent tradeoffs among members of the same target
group: fewer of them obtain any type of credit, but those that receive
government loans are better off.
Two concluding comments should be made.
above represent equilibrium responses.

First, the effects described

In particular, they take into

account the need to deter high-risks from pretending to be low-risks.

As a

consequence of this incentive compatibility constraint, whenever the
government eases some of the terms on low-risk contracts, the others must be
adversely affected in equilibrium.

19

Second, the paper has focused on a fairly standard adverse selection
model, based on Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976)

Numerous extensions of that

and other models have shown that the nature of equilibrium can be affected
by incentive effects (Stiglitz and Weiss 1986), project characteristics, the
set of available financial instruments (DeMeza and Webb 1987), alternative
projects (Chan and Thakor 1987), information sharing (Yotsuzuka 1987), the
shape of the production function (Milde and Riley 1988), and other
characteristics,

The effects of credit policies in such alternative models

deserve further exploration.

As described in Section 4, raising the interest rate on the low-

risk loan cannot restore incentive compatibility, because low risks are more
averse to accepting a higher interest rate than high risks are.
