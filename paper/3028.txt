INTERTENPORAL DEPENDENCE, IMPATIENCE, AND DYNAMICS

ABSTRACT

This paper develops simple geometric methods for analyzing dynamic
behavior in models with intertemporally dependent consumer tastes.
Since the preferences studied do not assume time—additivity, they
allow the marginal utility of consumption on a given date to vary
with consumption on other dates.

Intertemporal dependence is induced

by the presence of a variable individual rate of time preference.
The optimal consumption responses to transitory and anticipated
changes in incomes and interest rates are easily derived and are
similar in important ways to the responses implied by the standard
model with constant time preference.

Intuitive explanations of the

first—order conditions describing optimal paths are provided.

1. Introduction

This paper develops simple geometric methods for analyzing
dynamic models with intertemporally dependent consumer tastes. One

appealing feature

of

such preferences

is

they relax

the

widely used but restrictive assumption of time-additivity, thereby

allowing the marginal utility of consumption on a given date to
vary with consumption on other dates. Intertemporal dependence is

introduced through the presence of a variable individual rate of
time preference. This type of preference setup was introduced by
Uzawa (1968), and it has recently been extended and clarified by
Epstein (1987a).1

Uzawa-Epstein preferences fall into the broader category of
general recursive preferences, as defined by Koopmans (1986).
Lucas and Stokey (1984) and Epstein (1987b) study the stability of

steady states under quite general recursive preferences. Epstein
and Hynes (1983) examine some well-known dynamic economic models
using a particular specification of recursive utility. Judd (1985)
uses a preference specification that includes Epstein's (1987a) as
a special case, but his focus is on steady-state results. Becker,
Boyd, and Sung (1989) provide a general existence theorem for
recursive-preference problems of the type explored below.

Finally,

implications of time-additive preferences seem to clash with the
cross-sectional patterns of consumption and income growth actually
observed in the world economy (Sununers and Carroll 1989)!

In a deterministic setting with a fixed number of competitive

constant time-preference rates fail

to produce a determinate steady state in which all households have

more valuable, at the margin, relative to present.

It is easily shown that intertemporal preferences of the form

(1984) used to prove that the Uzawa problem has a solution.

This method is, however, even less versatile than the one
described in the text. The reason is that in many interesting
cases, the value function depends on factors other than a. For
example, an anticipated future income increase clearly makes
calendar time an additional argument of the value function. In
contrast, such a shock does not alter the relation between c and '

In both cases, there is an immediate drop in consumption, a

reflection of the fall in lifetime income;

and in both cases,

consumption subsequently rises as the consumer returns to point A.
The disturbance pushing the individual to point D leads him to run

down his assets while the higher tax is

on,

as

in models with

constant time preference. The move to point C, however, is caused

by a reduction in lifetime income so large that initially the
consumer's saving rises.

This makes intuitive sense:

the longer

the duration of the shock, the closer it is to being permanent.

Clearly, the degree of consumption smoothing predicted by the

endogenous time preference model is lower than that predicted by
traditional

permanent-income

type

models.

equal,

the consumers described above prefer stronger initial reactions to

income shocks,

a response pattern that allows them to return

eventually to habitual consumption levels.

4.4. Interest-Rate Disturbances

The interest rate enters directly into the dynamic equations
for consumption and lifetime utility, so the mode of analysis used

so far does not automatically apply to all types

of

interest-rate

disturbance. Permanent, unanticipated interest-rate changes remain
easy to analyze, however, using the preceding framework.

An assumption that the concave, increasing discount-rate function

the door to unbounded individual consumption growth.

The stability of this paper's models is closely linked to the
hypothesis that subjective discount rates are increasing functions

consumption.
