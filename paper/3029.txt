THE EMPLOYERS' COSTS OF WORXERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE:
MAGNITUDES, DETERMINANTS, AND PUBLIC POLICY

ABSTRACT

This

paper presents estimates of the average cost of the workers'

compensation insurance program for a homogeneous group of employers by state.
These estimates are of interest because they reflect the operation, direct
nominal costs, and efficiency of workers' compensation.

The paper estimates

cost equations for a variety of alternative specifications.

The main finding

is that when cost equations are estimated by ordinary least squares there is a
unit elasticity of costs with respect to benefits, but instrumental variable
estimates of the effect of benefits yield a greater than unit elasticity.

The

results also indicate that the presence of a state insurance fund is
associated with higher average costs to employers, all else equal.

Finally,

we explore the impact that the minimum standards recommended by the

Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws would have on workers'
compensation costs.

Workers

Introduction

compensation insurance is the primary program that provides cash

benefits, niedical care, and rehabilitation services to workers who are
disabled by work-related injuries and illnesses.

The program is larger than

unemployment insurance, AFDC, and food stamps, as measured by total
expenditures (Bixby, 1989).

The provisions of workers' compensation

insurance, such as coverage and benefit levels, are determined exclusively by
the states, which distinguishes workers' compensation frotu most other social
insurance programs in the United States.

Also, in contrast to most other

social insurance programs, the insurance arrangements in workers' compensation
include a mixture of private insurance carriers, state insurance funds, and
self- insuring employers.

These distinctive attributes of workers' compensation are the basis for
three topics examined in this paper.

One topic is the relative cost

efficiency of the various insurance arrangements used to provide benefits.
Specifically, we examine whether the costs of workers' compensation insurance
provided by private insurance carriers in a jurisdiction are affected by the
presence of a competitive state insurance fund.

The second topic concerns the

interstate differences in the employers' costs of workers' compensation
insurance.

We are interested in the magnitude of these costs in 1983 (the

most recent year with data available for all variables in our study), and in
how they have changed since 1972.

In 1972, the National Commission on State

Wor1en's Compensation Laws conditionally supported the enactment of federal
standards for the program as a means of reducing the disparity in costs and
benefits among the states (see National Conimission, 1972, p. 26).

We estimate

the effect such standards would have on the level and dispersion in workers'
conpensation insurance costs.

2

Finally, we use the interstate variability in state workers' compensation
programs to estimate the relationship between insurance costs and benefits.

This relationship is of interest because in the absence of a behavioral
response to insurance, costs would rise proportionally with benefits, all else
equal.

On the other hand, if either employers or employees change their

behavior in response to higher benefits, costs may rise more or less than
proportionally with benefits.
The paper is organized as follows.

II.

Measuring the Employers' Costs of Workers' Compensation

Until recently, workers' compensation insurance has been a highly
regulated line of insurance.

The program is primarily financed by insurance

premiums paid by employers; about 20 percent of all benefits are paid directly
by self-insuring employers.1

Employers who purchase insurance from private

companies or from state insurance funds are assigned to one or more industrial
or occupational classifications.

Most states follow the uniform

classifications prescribed by the National Council on Compensation Insurance
(MCCI), or use a roughly comparable classification system.

As the basis for

our estimates, we have selected 45 widely used insurance classifications

that

accounted for 62% of all payroll for employers who purchased workers'
compensation insurance nationally.2

Twelve of

the

selected classifications

are manufacturing industries, seven are contracting industries (e.g., concrete
work), and the remainder are primarily service and sales industries.
After each of the employer's operations is assigned to a particular
insurance classification, an initial insurance rate called the manual rate is
located in the state's schedule.

Manual rates are stated as a certain number

of dollars per $100 of weekly earnings for each employee.3

As of 1983,

forty-six states and the District of Columbia had rating systems that could be
compared for the 45 insurance classifications that we examine.

For each of

these jurisdictions, we calculate a weighted average manual rate for the 45

insurance classifications, using the distribution of national payroll among
these classifications as the weights.

Most employers, however, do not pay insurance premiums that are solely a
product of their payroll times the manual rate for their insurance
classification.

Insurance premiums are often adjusted to an employer's own

accident experience (i.e., experience-rating), premium discounts for quantity

purchases, and dividends received from mutual companies or participating stock
companies.4

In addition, by 1983 most states allowed carriers to deviate from

the manual rates after obtaining the insurance commissioner's approval, and
six states allowed "open competition" among insurance carriers.

Using an

approach described in detail in Burton and Krueger (1986), we adjust the
manual premiums to reflect these factors.5

The first four columns of Table 1

report weighted averages of manual rates adjusted for experience-rating,

premium dicounts, deviations, open competition, and dividends.
The estimates of "adjusted manual rates" in Table 1 can be interpreted as
the percent of payroll expended on workers' compensation by a homogeneous

most of the years we study, data are not available to make state
specific adjustments for experience-rating or dividend payments. Since most
states use a uniform experience-rating formula we use the national average
experience-rating and dividend offset in these states. We use state specific
data for states that substantially deviate from the norm. See Burton and
Krueger (1986).
5The cost measures for the states that allow open competition are
adjusted to reflect more recent state-level information on the impact of open
competition.
The adjusted manual rates for the six states with open
competition in effect as of January 21, 1983 are the manual rates shown in
Table 3 of Burton and Krueger (1986) times the estimated net impact of open
competition shown in Table 7-12 of Hunt, Krueger and Burton (1988)

The results indicate, for example, that as of January 1,

the 45 types of employers spent, on average,

workers' compensation premiums in Alabama.

.905 percent of payroll on

The mean cost among all 47 states

in that year was 1.290 percent of payroll.
It is also useful to examine the dollar amount of workers' compensation
weekly premiums paid per employee.

To compare such figures across states, it

is necessary to control for differences in the average wage that stem from the
state's industrial mix.6

Consequently, we calculate a weighted average of

each state's wage using the individual state's industry wage distribution and
the national industry employment distribution.

The last four columns in Table

1 present estimates of the "net cost" of workers' compensation insurance,
which equals the adjusted manual rate times the "industry-adjusted" state

The table indicates, for

example, that the 45 types of employers spent, on average, $2.565 per week per
employee on workers' compensation premiums in Alabama in 1983.

7We note that Butler and Worrall (1988) develop a more extensive model
that allows for variations in the duration of work-related injuries as well.

If insurance rates are actuarially fair the average workers' compensation
cost per worker is

C — p8.

It is more realistic, however, to allow for a

loading factor that is proportional to workers' compensation rates to cover
administrative costs.

In this situation,

So far we have assumed that the probability of a work-related injury is

If an employee's probability of receiving workers' compensation

benefits depends positively (or negatively) on the benefit rate because of
reasons discussed below, then insurance costs would rise more (or less) than
proportionally with benefits.

successfully file.

This increase in claims could come about either through a

moral hazard effect, in which workers take less care on the job and incur more
work injuries in response to increased income security (the "true injury
effect"), or through an incentive to report claims for injuries that would not
have been reported in the absence of a sufficient monetary incentive (the
'reporting effect"), or a combination of both effects.

A finding that the coefficient on benefits is less than one would support
the conclusion that

increased workers' compensation benefits lead to a

safer work environment, perhaps because experience rating causes higher

benefits to enhance the incentive for employers to provide safe working
conditions.

Alternatively, a negative estimate of

may reflect employer or

carrier decisions to more aggressively oppose claims in response to higher
benefits.

Finally, if the coefficient on benefits equals one, there is

evidence that on net workers' compensation benefits have no effect on the
number of claims.

This could come about because the various effects

described above are either offsetting or insignificant.

Most previous

studies, such as Chelius (1977) and Butler and Worrall (1983), have found a
positive relationship between benefits and costs, which has been interpreted
as evidence of a moral hazard effect.9
If the frequency of on-the-job injuries is not affected by the workers'
compensation benefit level, it is necessary to control for the injury rate as
shown in equation (1) for two reasons.

First, a high injury rate may lead to

political pressure for high benefits, which would bias the estimate of y

of moral hazard and reporting effects. Ehrenberg (1988) discusses the

unless the injury rate is included in the equation; and second, even if the
injury rate and benefit level are uncorrelated, including the injury rate will
improve the precision of the estimates.

Other Regressors
It is desirable to control for other relevant institutional and economic
variables that influence workers' compensation costs in a state.

We estimate

the simple model in equation (2), and estimate models that include explanatory
variables measuring medical benefits, the presence of a competitive state
insurance fund, the proportion of the sate's workforce that is unionized, the
extent of coverage under the state workers' compensation law, and the
proportion of cases accounted for by permanent partial disabilities.
The insurance arrangements that deliver workers' compensation benefits
differ from state to state, with variation in the importance of private
carriers, competitive or exclusive state funds, and self-insurance.

It is

widely believed that these types of insurance arrangements influence the costs
of workers' compensation.

The workers' compensation program is unique among

social insurance programs in the extent of private sector involvement in the
enforcement of the program, collection of premiums, and delivery of benefits,

and thus offers an unusual opportunity to study the relative efficiency of
private versus public provision of social insurance.

Although the debate over the proper insurance delivery system ranges over
several issues, this study can only estimate the relative cost to employers of
insurance purchased in states that allow private sector insurance companies to
compete against the state insurance fund.11

Differences in services, tax

liabilities, reserving practices, and reporting requirements that vary among
the insurance schemes are not directly accounted for by the model,
One hypothesis is that the presence of a state insurance fund will be
associated with higher insurance costs to employers because a state
bureaucracy will be inefficient and have some monopoly power.

An alternative

view, however, is that state-fund insurance is less costly than private
insurance because state-operated funds benefit from economies of scale and
tax-exempt status, and the absence of a profit motive leads to smaller loading

recent theoretical and empirical analysis of the returns to scale, efficiency,
and hidden costs of public versus private workers' compensation insurance.

10

Another factor expected to influence the cost of workers' compensation to
employers is the extent of unionization.

Butler and Worrall (1983) find a

positive and statistically significant relationship between unionization and
workers' compensation claims.

If unions play a critical role providing

"voice" in the work-place, this finding is to be expected since unionized

workers would be better informed about and more likely to exercise their
rights under workers' compensation laws than nonunionized workers.
Alternatively, the union rate may be positively related to the injury rate
because unions find it easier to organize more dangerous work-places, all else
equal.

We expect that among the states the proportion of workers unionized

will be positively associated with workers' compensation costs.

The fraction of the states workforce covered by workers' compensation
legislation is expected to be related to the employers' costs of insurance.
If employees in exempt occupations are at greater risk of work-related
disabilities than employees in covered occupations, a greater proportion of
covered workers in a state is expected to be associated with greater workers'
compensation costs.

The opposite result would imply that exempt occupations

are safer than covered occupations.

Permanent partial disability benefits are paid to workers with relatively
serious injuries, so that losses of actual earnings or of earning capacity
continue even after maximum medical recovery.

The statutes and practices used

to compensate and classify these cases vary widely among the states.

We

control for this institutional feature by including a variable measuring
permanent partial disability cases as a proportion of all cases.

Since

permanent partial cases account for a disproportionate share of workers
compensation benefit payments, we expect a positive relationship between the

11

relative importance of permanent partial cases and insurance costs.

We also

expect that higher medical benefits will increase the cost of workers'
compensation insurance.

To estimate the expected weekly benefit from the statutory

provisions, we calculate the mean of the censored benefit distribution for
each state.

14

Many states impose limits on the duration of benefit payments or on the
total dollar amount of benefits.

We apply the NCCI's commutation procedures

to discount weekly permanent total and fatal benefits durations for interest,

mortality, dollar amount limitations, and escalation of benefits where
applicable.

The duration index times the expected weekly benefit yields an

estimate of the total expected benefit package for the disability class.

In

addition, we adjust temporary totaUbenefits to reflect the length of the
waiting period which is required before benefits begin, and the length of the
retroactive period upon which compensation is paid for the waiting period.
Estimates of scheduled and nonscheduled permanent partial benefits for

1972 to 1978 were provided by Butler and Worrall and updated by the authorsJ5
These permanent partial benefits calculations take into account the weekly
benefit levels as well as the number of weeks for which benefits are payable.
For our purposes, the scheduled and nonscheduled benefits were weighted by the
relative frequency of those types of injuries in each state and collapsed into
an overall permanent partial benefit.

Results

Table 3 presents reduced form least squares regression estimates of cost

equations using the log of adjusted manual rates as the dependent variable and
allowing for a variety of different independent variables.

Table 4 contains

parallel results using the log of net costs as the dependent variable.16

The

equations are estimated on an unbalanced panel of states from 1972 to 1983.17
In some specifications we exploit the longitudinal nature of the data and
estimate within state (or fixed effects) regressions to control for timeinvariant state effects, such as the efficiency of the state administrative
agency.

18

16The log-log specification for costs and benefits seems appropriate for
three reasons: first, estimation of the Box-Cox transformation finds that the
best fit is approximately log-log; second, a plot of the data reveals a
nonlinear, increasing relationship between costs and benefits; and third, the
model in section III predicts a log-log relationship between costs and benefits.
17We do not include separate year dummies because we want the common
time-series variation in benefits to identify the equations. A Chow test of
structural change does not reject the hypothesis that the determinants of
workers' compensation costs are stable over the years examined at the 01
level for all of the specifications presented in Tables 3 and 4.
18Since our sample consists of observations on states that vary greatly
in size, there is reason to suspect conditional heteroscedasticity. We
therefore performed a series of Breusch-Pagan (1979) tests by regressing the

The results indicate that for either measure of workers' compensation
costs we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is a unit elasticity
between costs and benefits, regardless of the set of included regressors.

The

estimated elasticity between benefits and costs is slightly greater than one
if state dummies are omitted from the equation, and slightly less than one if
state dummies are added to the equation.

These results imply that for a given

proportional change in indemnity benefits, workers' compensation insurance
costs will rise by the same proportion.

This finding does not support the

generally positive relationship between benefits and the number of reported
injuries found in most earlier studies.

However, if the state-level benefit

variable is measured with error, the elasticity between benefits and costs
will be biased downward asymptotically, and the attenuation bias will be
greater in the fixed effects models if (as seems likely) the state dummies
absorb more of the signal than noise in the benefit variable.
The possibility of an errors-in-variables problem with the benefit
variable lead us to use the states' maximum benefit, minimum benefit, waiting

period and retroactive period as instruments for the benefit variablej9
These results are reported in Appendix Table Al for models without the injury
rate.

Instrumenting for the benefit variable with these proxies in the

adjusted manual rate equations leads the coefficient (standard error) on

squared-residuals of the estimated2equations on the total employment of each
state; the sample size times the R of these ancillary regressions
asymptotically follows a chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom.
Results of these tests show no evidence of conditional heteroscedasticity.
For instance, the chi-square statistic for the test corresponding to the first
column of Table 1 is only .08.
19These parameters relate to temporary total benefits, which account for
the greatest share of cases.

of

Similar results

Thus, measurement error may indeed bias the estimate

downward, and instrumenting for benefits brings our estimates closer to

the previous literature.

Nonetheless, the estimate of

even after correcting

for measurement error is not statistically significantly different from zero
in the fixed effects specification.

One explanation for the smaller point estimates of the net injury
response to higher benefits in our analysis than in the previous literature is
that the additional claims that result from increased benefits have relatively
low costs.

Such claims would have little effect on our costs measures, but

would have a larger effect on measures of injuries that treat all claims
equally.

Another key variable is the dummy variable indicating the presence of a
state insurance fund.

We find that the presence of a state fund is associated

with nearly a 20 percent increase in average insurance costs, all else equal.
Moreover, this conclusion is unchanged when either measure of costs is the
dependent variable.

Since no state added or eliminated a competitive state

insurance fund in the period covered by our sample, we can not estimate the
effect of the state fund once the 28 state dummy variables are included in the
model unless additional covariance restrictions are made.2°

201-iausman and Taylor (1981) show that the effect of a variable that is
constant over time can still be estimated in a fixed effects specification if
one of the included variables is uncorrelated with the time-invariant
component of the error term and correlated with the variable of interest.

is no legitimate covariance restriction to use to identify the effect of a
state fund in the fixed effects specifications.

16

As expected, the models that include the log of the injury rate typically
find a positive relationship between reported injuries and the cost of
workers' compensation insurance.

The coefficient on the log injury rate is

substantially less than one, however, possibly due to inaccurate reporting of
work injuries to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

When the

coefficient on the injury rate is constrained to equal one, the other
coefficients retain the same sign and are of similar magnitude.
The proportion of cases that are classified as permanent partial
disabilities has the expected positive sign.

The variable becomes

statistically insignificant when the state dummies are added, however.
Curiously, we find that the union membership rate has a positive effect on
costs in the regressions without state dummy variables, but has a sizable
negative impact when we include the state dummies.

One possible explanation

for this pattern is that in the fixed effects specification the union rate is
identified by within state time-series variation in union membership, and over
this time period the union rate was generally trending down while workers
compensation costs were trending up.

The coefficients for the medical benefit

index and the coverage rate are consistently positive and consistently
statistically insignificant.

Federal Standards and Workers' Compensation Insurance Costs

The National Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws concluded
that, "State workmen's compensation laws in general are inadequate and
inequitable" (National Commission, 1972, p. 119).21

The National Commission

21The conclusion that workers' compensation benefits are inadequate is
also supported by empirical work by Viscusi and Moore (1987).

recommendations, the Commission endorsed the passage of federal minimum
standards to encourage compliance with its recommendations.

The justificatior

for federal standards offered by the National Commission was that their
enactment "will remove from each State the main barrier to effective workmen's
compensation reform: the fear that compensation costs may drive employers to
move away to markets where protection for disabled workers is inadequate but
less expensive" (National Commission, 1972, p.

27).

Several objections can be offered to this justification.

Perhaps most

important, higher benefits in a state could be offset by lower wages, and
therefore employers in high benefit states would not be at a competitive
disadvantage.

However, while there is evidence of a trade-off between-

benefits and wages, the results are not compelling that benefit increases are
fully offset by lower wages (see Ruser, 1985, Viscusi and Moore, 1987, and
Hamermesh and Wolfe, 1989) .

Employers certainly act as if they will bear the

burden of higher benefits, and they effectively lobby many legislators
(National Commission, 1972, p. 125).

22

We will not attempt to resolve the issue of the incidence of workers'
compensation costs in this paper.

There is another argument against federal

standards, however, that we will address.

The implicit assumption underlying

the National Commission's assertion that federal standards will reduce
interstate differences in costs is that states with low benefits have low

18

costs, and therefore forcing these states to improve benefits will decrease
dispersion in costs.

If, however, low benefit states already have relatively

high costs, then federal standards will only increase the dispersion in costs
among states and thus defeat the basic rationale for standards.

We use the estimated elasticity of costs with respect to benefits to
simulate the impact that proposed national standards for workers' compensation
benefits would have on the level and dispersion in employers' direct costs of
workers' compensation insurance.

Specifically, we focus on the eight

essential recommendations that directly affect indemnity benefits.

These

recommendations require the maximum benefit to be at least 100 percent of the
state average weekly wage for temporary total, permanent total, and fatal
cases, and require a replacement rate of at least two-thirds the gross weekly
wage for these cases.

In addition, the recommendations require temporary

total, permanent total, and fatal benefits to be paid for the duration of the
disability, or for life, without any limitations on the total dollar amount.
The actuarial methods described in section III were used to estimate the
expected, discounted value of benefits for a successful claim in each state
assuming that the essential benefit recommendations were fully adopted and
enforced.

State laws that did not meet the standards were brought up to the

level of the National Commission's recommendations, while provisions that
already met or exceeded the minimum standards were not altered.23

Our

estimates predict that in 1972 workers' compensation benefits would have been
36 percent greater than actual costs on average in the 29 states if the eight

essential benefit recommendation were incorporated into each state law.

By

1983, compliance with the benefit recommendations would have increased
benefits by an average of 14 percent.

Our approach to estimating the effect of compliance with minimum
standards on insurance costs is based on the equations estimated in Tables 3
and 4:

The mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for the
simulated and actual costs based on equation (6) are presented in Table 5.

The simulated costs were estimated under two extreme assumptions: first, using
the elasticity

estimated in the most parsimonious model (model 1 of

Tables 3 and 4); second, using the elasticity estimated in the within state
analysis (model 6 of Tables 3 and 4).

As to be expected, the simulation results indicate that the direct cost
of workers' compensation insurance to employers would have increased in our
sample if the National Commission's recommendations were adopted.

The

evidence regarding the effect of national standards on the dispersion in costs
across states, however, is mixed.

In the 1970s the simulations suggest that

national standards would have increased the standard deviation in workers
compensation costs, while in 1983 the standard deviation would have been
reduced.

Furthermore, in every year the coefficient of variation is lower

under the assumption that states would have complied with the National
Commission's proposed minimum standards.

Since adjusted manual rates and net

costs have an approximately log normal distribution, the coefficient of
variation may be the most appropriate measure of dispersion in this situation.
Several caveats are in order regarding the robustness of the simulated
costs.

First, the volume of litigation may initially increase following

enactment of federal minimum standards due to the uncertainty that accompanies
changes in the law.

And second, the parameters and structure of the models

may change if national minimum standards are actually established.

As a

result, we take the simulated costs as a rough indication of the consequences
of federal standards rather than a precise estimate.

Conclusions

The results of our snalysis of workers' compensation costs support three
main conclusions.

First, when cost equations are estimated by OLS the

elasticity of workers' compensation costs with respect to benefits is
statistically indistinguishable from one.

Instrumental variable estimates of

the cost-benefit elasticity are greater than one, but still smaller than would
be expected based on estimates of the claims-benefit elasticity in the past
literature.

One possible explanation for this finding vts-a-vis the previous

research is that higher workers' compensation benefits may induce claims that
are relatively minor and of small cost.

If this were the case, the elasticity

of costs with respect to benefits would be less than the elasticity of claims
with respect to benefits.

Second, after controlling for factors such as the benefit level and
injury rate

workers' compensation insurance costs are higher in states that

have state-operated insurance funds competing with private carriers than in
states with only private insurance carriers.

There are several possible

explanations for this finding, including the possible inefficiency associated
with a state bureaucracy, and omitted variables that are correlated with the
presence of state insurance funds and workers' compensation costs.

Clearly,

the sources of this relationship should be examined further before policy
actions are taken.
Finally

our simulations indicate that the federal minimum standards

proposed by the National Conunission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws would

increase the average costs of workers' compensation insurance and decrease the
coefficient of variation among the states in all time periods.

The impact of

the minimum standards on the standard deviation of costs is mixed; for 1983

22

and for the four years combined the standard deviation for either cost measure
would be decreased by the standards, but in the three other years studied the
standard deviation would increase.

As a result, the success or failure of the

national Commission's prescription to narrow the dispersion in workers'
compensation costs among the states by requiring minimum federal standards

appears dependent on the time period of interest and the measure of dispersion
used.
