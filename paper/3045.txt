NARRATIVE VERSUS STRUCTURAL APPROACHES

(1989) to those from the structural approach regarding the effects of monetary
policy on real output. The results from both approaches lead to the
conclusions that monetary policy matters and that the effects build slowly

this paper is to see if the two approaches lead to similar results regarding

monetary policy effects.
RR chose six months in the post-war period in which they believed there
was a negative monetary shock that was independent of the level of output:
October 1947, September 1955, December 1968, April 1974, August 1978, and
October 1979.

They defined a dummy variable, D, that is one in each of

these months and zero otherwise.

They next regressed the percentage change

in industrial production on a constant,

11 seasonal dummy variables,

24 lags

of the percentage change in industrial production, the current value of 0,
and 36 lags of 0.

The estimation period was January 1948

-

December 1987.

From this regression they computed the impulse response function of a one
unit increase in D.

2

The impulse response function showed little effect on industrial
produotion for about the first eight montha after the shock, but negative
and fairly large effects after that.

The maximum impact was industrial

production 12 percent lower after 33 months.

Similar results were obtained

using the level of the unemployment rate in plate of the percentage change
in industrial production.

many variables that belong in the true reduced form equations for industrial
production and unemployment.

Certainly the implicit reduced form equations

for output and unemployment in a typical macroeconometricmodel contain many
more variables than are in the RR regressions.
RR examine the robustness of their results by adding supply-shock,
fiscal-policy,

and inflation variables to their regressions and by excluding

certain shocks from the regressions.

They report that adding other

variables lowers the maximum impact on industrial production and
unemployment slightly, but no numbers are given.

Although PR chose

April 1974 as a shock month, the overall shock in this case was much smaller
than the others as measured by the size and duration of the increase in PS
from the base quarter.

Only in 1974 II and III was PS higher than the base-

quarter value of 7.60.

The results for Experiment

3 show that this shock

Experiment 6 is for the shock that began in October 1979.
here are also fairly large.

The effects

The peak effects are after 10 quarters, with

the effect on industrial production of 6.00 percent and the effect on the
unemployment rate of 1.49 percentage points.
It should be noted that the present results would not be changed very
much if the beginning quarter for each shock was taken to be one quarter
sooner than what was in fact done.

In each case, as can be seen in Table 1,

the interest rate in the quarter sooner is close to the interest rate in the
quarter actually used,

For Experiment 1, for eiample, the interest rate in

the quarter sooner is 1.61, which is only slightly smaller than the value of
1.86 used.

The results in Table 1 are thus not sensitive

to timing issues

of this kind.
What do the overall results in Table 1 say about the RR results? There
are four main messages

First (a point that is not model specific),

the

size and duration of the shocks as measured by the interest rate deviations
vary considerably across the five shock periods.

It is thus not clear that

RR's use of one for all six nonzero values of 0 is accurate,

Second,

the RR

result that the initial effects are small and the peak effect occurs after

33 to 34 months is consistent with some loose average of the results

Third, the persistence of the P.R effects is inconsistent with the

results in Table 1, which in fact show small cycles being generated.
