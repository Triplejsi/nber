SYNTHETIC EUROCURRENCY INTEREST RATE FUTURES CONTRACTS:

THEORY AND EVIDENCE

ABSTRACT

In this paper, we develop a theoretical (arbitrage) pricing model for a Eurocurrency
interest rate futures contract and measure its hedging effectiveness. This synthetic
Eurocurrency interest rate futures contract is obtained by combining exisiting Eurodollar
interest rate futures contracts with near term and far term currency futures contracts based
on the covered interest rate parity relationship. In theory, the cash flows of the synthetic
contract perfectly replicate the cash flows of a Eurocurrency interest rate futures contract.
Our empirical results show that the synthetic contracts are relatively efficient in hedging
non-dollar borrowing rates. These results have implications for the practice of hedging
non-dollar interest rate risk and for the development of actual Eurocurrency interest rate
futures markets.
