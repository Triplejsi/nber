DISTANCE, DEMAND, AND OLIGOPOLY PRICING

ABSTRACT

We demonstrate how to estimate a model of product demand and oligopoly
pricing when products are multi-dimensionally differentiated. We provide an
empirical counterpart to recent theoretical work on product differentiation.
Using specifications informed by economic theory, we simultaneously estimate a
demand system and price-cost margins for products differentiated in many
dimensions.
