AN EQUILIBRIUM THEORY OF EXCESS VOLATILITY AND MEAN
REVERSION IN STOCK MARKET PRICES

ABSTRACT

Apparent mean reversion and excess volatility in stock market prices can be
reconciled with the Efficient Market Hypothesis by
specifying investor
preferences that give rise to the demand for portfolio insurance.
Therefore,
several supposed macro anomalies can be shown to be consistent with a rational
market in a simple and parsimonious model of the economy. Unlike other models
that have derived equilibriwn mean reversion in prices, the model in this paper
does not require that the production side of the economy exhibit mean
reversion. It also predicts that mean reversion and excess volatility will
differ substantially across subperiods.

Introduction
The two biggest challenges to the Efficient Market Hypothesis in

recent years have been findings that stock market prices are excessively
volatile compared to dividends [Shiller (1981)], and that aggregate stock
price indices exhibit mean reversion [Fama and French (1988), Poterba and
Sunirners (1988)]. Most researchers of these phenomena are careful to note

that their findings are not necessarily inconsistent with efficient
markets, and in particular, that they can be reconciled with the E?ffi via

time-varying interest rates or risk prernia. Nevertheless, it appears
difficult at first glance to imagine credible models of the economy that
would generate equilibrium behavior consistent with these phenomena, and
the literature by and large leaves the impression that the most
economical explanation of these "macro anomalies" lies in systematic

overreaction of security prices to exogenous shocks. Indeed, the now
common terminology "fads model" and "excess" volatility reveals the
tentative inference drawn from these studies.

More recently, equilibrium models consistent with apparent mean
reversion in stock market prices have been advanced by Cecchetti, Lam,

and Mark (1988) and Brock and LeBaron (1989), Both of these papers use
variants of Lucas' (1978) model, and both exploit consumption smoothing

motives to generate stationarity in stock price distributions. In
Cecchetti et al., the real sector is modeled by positing two states (boom

and bust) for the macro economy with Markov transition probabilities. In
low dividend periods, individuals desire to sell assets to maintain

consumption levels. In aggregate, however, net demand cannot be
negative. Instead, asset prices fall and expected returns rise. Thus,
the driving force behind mean reversion in prices is the desire for
consumption smoothing in the presence of stochastic, but (because of the

two-state

4

assumption) essentially mean-reverting, shocks to dividend

growth. In Brock and LeBaron, a similar effect is achieved by
considering i.i.d. shocks to an otherwise fixed production function.
While they focus on liquidity constraints at the level of the firm, they
also show that the tendency for high

consumption to revert back to

typical consumption will cause mean reversion in prices at an aggregate

level. In both papers, there is a well-defined notion of "good times"
and "bad times," and the economy tends

on average toward normal times.

This paper also is an attempt to reconcile mean reversion and excess

volatility with market rationality. Unlike the previous literature,
however, the model focuses on risk aversion per Se, and is unconcerned

with consumption smoothing. Indeed, even if the real economy as measured
by dividends or earnings follows a pure random walk, so that agents do
not foresee changes in output, stock prices in this model still will seem
to exhibit both mean reversion and excess

volatility. This result

therefore extends and complements the results in the Lucas-based models,
and shows that even a very simple one-period model can generate
meaningful mean reversion and excess volatility.
In contrast to the Lucas-based models, the model in this paper

relies on the particular specification of

Utility functions to generate

interesting results. However, not much Structure is necessary to obtain

these results. In particular, I show that a sufficient condition for

—2—

both mean reversion and excess volatility is that the representative
agent in the economy would be a demander of portfolio insurance if the

risk-free rate and market price of risk were constant. This condition is
straightforward and is consistent with the demand for portfolio insurance

evident in the marketplace. The model used here is related to Blacks
(1989) model in that both rely on an inverse relationship between the

market price of risk and asset prices to generate mean reversion. Black,
however, posits this relationship a priori, and explores its

consequences. Here, the derivation of the relationship is the central
focus of the paper.

Section 2 of this paper lays out a formal model of the economy and
shows how mean reversion and apparent excess volatility can arise in a

rational market. Section 3 explores the potential magnitude of these

effects. Section 4 concludes.

2. Equilibrium Macro Anomalies
Because the demand for portfolio insurance will play a central role
in the analysis to follow, I will specify a utility function intimately

related to such a demand. Consider, therefore, the family of utility
functions of end-of—period wealth of the form

U(w) =
l-y
where W .

mm

is

(w—w
.)
mm

(1)

a floor on wealth that might correspond to a subsistence

value and is the natural level at which wealth would be insured. The
function in equation (1) is a member of the HARA family of utility

functions. Perold (1986) shows that such a derived utility function is

—3—

consistent with a more rigorously defined intertemporal utility of
consumption function, U(C), where

U(C) =

and C .

is

subsistence consumption. Similarly, Constantinides (3.988>

derives a similar, though more complex, version of (1) where
"subsistence" consumption is determined by habit

formation.

[See his

equation (11).]

It is easy to show that the relative risk aversion, A, of an
inveStor with utility function (1) is

reduction in the value of holdings of the risky asset leads to an even

larger reduction in demand for the risky asset. After the shock, there
will be a desire to sell off shares to restore portfolio balance. But
this response constitutes a generalized version of portfolio insurance,
whereby investors follow a rule that shifts the portfolio from risky to

riskless assets as the risky asset falls in value (Perold and Sharpe,
1988).

Of course, there cannot be a net demand for portfolio insurance in
the face of fixed market parameters, since not

everyone in equilibriwn

can simultaneously desire to buy or sell shares. Leland (1980) takes the
investment opportunity set as given and examines the conditions
determining which heterogeneous investors will be suppliers or demanders

of portfolio insurance. Here, we impose more homogeneity on preferences

the market parameter rM to adjust to maintain equilibrium.

As agents sell of f shares in response to the exogenous shock, prices fall

further and rM increases. The market clearing Condition, equation (5),
is restored when

rM increases by enough to equate quantity demanded to

the market value of the risky asset. 2

Therefore, the same condition that gives rise to a demand for
portfolio insurance, W .

mm

, F, also will result in both excess

volatility and mean reversion in the price of the risky asset.

Consider

first excess volatility. The shock to corporate profitability, or for
concreteness dividends, lowers prices directly through the present value

relationship. Then there is a secondary, or "multiplier effect" as
decreased demand for shares lowers prices even further.

As a result, P

will be more volatile than dividends, kow consider mean reversion. The
equilibrium expected market return will increase after the market price
falls, thereby leading to the appearance of mean reversion iii prices. We

turn to the potential magnitude of these effects in the next section.
As a digression, however, note that it is easy to Stretch the model
a bit to rationalize the 1.0 and Macinley (1987) result that at short

horizons, the market exhibits Positive serial correlation. If portfolio
adjustments occur with a lag after the market is shocked, then the price
effect of the change in equilibrium rM which reinforces the exogenous
Shock to prices, will be spread out over a brief period, leading to
positive short-term Serial correlation in aggregate market returns. Over
longer horizons, however, after the market equilibrates to the new
expected return, serial correlation in returns will appear negative.

3. Nerica. Solutions
To quantify the potential for mean reversion and excess volatility,

we need to specify the stock valuation process. One of the simplest
specifications is that dividends, D, follow a lognormal random walk with

trend. Suppose, therefore, that

Dtl

Dt =

exp(u + g -

2,2)

where u is normally distributed as N(O, 2) and g is the trend growth
rate of dividends. Given this specification, the value of the risky
asset is simply

D

(6)

rM - g

Recall that as D is shocked, rM will change as well, leading to a

secondary impact on P. The elasticity of P with respect to D is, from
equation (6)

dP/P

= -PM

(7)

dD

dD/D

Equation (7) is the excess volatility relationship. Because
drM/dD C 0,

the proportional change in the market price when D is

shocked will exceed the proportional change in dividends, and indeed, in
a single factor model with shocks only to D, the relative volatilities
will be

risk averse that no promised return can induce enough demand to absorb

the supply of risky shares. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the problem. In
Figure 2, as rM increases, stock demand initially increases (a

substitution

effect), but ultimately must fall because increases in

reduce P, and thereby overall wealth, which eventually dominates the

substitution effect. Indeed, by the time rM is high enough to drive P
down to W .
mm

— F, demand will fall to zero. Note that while there
are

two intersections of the demand and supply curves, only the equilibrium

on the left is stable. If D is too low given the values of y and
as in Figure 3, there will be no intersection between the
demand for and the value of the risky asset.
Returning to Figure 1, it is apparent that equilibrium mean
reversion" can vary considerably across subperiods. When wealth is high

relative to W., the equilibrium expected return is nearly constant,
and the aggregate market should obey a random walk if the driving

variable D is a random walk. In periods
or depressions, however, wealth_induced

that include severe recessions

changes in risk aversion will be

correspondingly severe and can lead to equilibrium returns that vary
substantially and inversely with the level of stock prices. This
implication is consistent with the finding of

Kim, Nelson, and Startz

(1988) that mean reversion in the postwar period is not significantly
different from zero, but is significant in

periods that include the Great

Depression.

Figure 4 presents the ratio of

as a function

of D. The relationship is similar to that observed for equilibrium
rM. At low wealth levels, small changes in wealth result in

—9—

relatively

5

large changes in rM and, consequently, to a larger multiplier effect on

stock prices. Hence, the "excess volatility" ratio is greater in this
region. At higher wealth levels, the volatility ratio asymptotes to
1.0. Again, the excess volatility ratio can be arbitrarily high, and
should be expected to vary across subperiods.

4. Conclusion
Apparent mean reversion and excess volatility in stock market prices
are consistent with a rational market equilibrium in an economy that
would be characterized by a net demand for portfolio insurance if the

market price of risk were fixed. The model developed here therefore
shows that the Efficient Market Hypothesis is broadly consistent with a

range of recent "macro anomalies." Moreover, the model sheds some light
on the different degrees of mean reversion measured in different
subperiods, as well as on the shorter—term positive serial correlation in
stock market prices.

One obvious question is whether an equilibrium model like the one in

this paper can be empirically tested against a fads model. An empirical
implication of this model is that periods of high mean reversion and

highe excess volatility ought to coincide and ought to occur following

severe market declines. A model of market irrationality that holds that
fads are essentially overreactions to exogenous shocks which the market
eventually corrects also would predict a coincidence of mean reversion

and excess volatility, but not necessarily following bear markets. If,
however, market mispricing is independent of fundamentals, perhaps
deriving from noise traders for example, then it is possible that

— 10 —

episodes of excess

volatility

and mean reversion would occur

independently leading to another difference in the empirical
implications of the two models.

If Win exceeds F then the market equilibrium (equation (5)]

requires that (rMrf)/Y

exceeds 1, implying in turn

that the LHS has a greater sensitivity to P than the RHS.

It is possible that an equilibriuni might not exist.

As rM rises,

demand as a fraction of wealth increases, but wealth falls because
the price of the risky asset will fall as its discount rate

increases. It is possible that there is no market clearing value of

rM. This

issue is explored more fully in the next section.
