THE EVOLUTION OF UNJUST-DISMISSAL LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES
ABSTRACT
In the last ......., state cnnts in IIIiU1Y areas of the United states have

ruled in favor of eqlloyeeB alleqin;J they were inptcp::rly disnissed.

Many

eqlloyDBlt-at-will doctrine is 1&:JL

P the last 100 years, jth secirity in the Uhit1 States has been
law "ip1oynit-at-will" doctrine.1 unier this
governad by the o

doctrine, an loyer can l'fly di ii an loyee for a go reason, a
bad reason, or r reason at all. The ployer's urinitigatad right to i ni
at-will eaployees, Iever, has been wsaksrd by autc*s state rt
r'1ins in severs]. juri.sdictia in the 19808. In iticzi, legislation to
require sane form of "just "e" to di iii at-will ez,1oyees has been
intrxt in t state legislatures.2 Jirxl in 1987, 1tana passad larxtnark
legislation reiirin finne to have a just reason to fire a rker. E4tein
(1984), Lazear (1987), ar (1988), aid others have aiqued that jticial aid
legislative dartuxea fran the
doctrine sild be resisted
because they have de1etericts ic effects.

legislation is desirable.3 'flu paper advar the hypothesis that irdepeident

As a brk, it is ueeful to xzider the cxzxUtia tner whicth

for the partiee invo].ved, b.tt will nct affect the

afloti of resr or the Pareto tiiielity of a irket euuy. This
has inçortant iiçlicatia for the legal xitroversy over aploynnt—at-will.

In particular, if the rights to jcte (e.g., the restricti az review
proores that govern firii) are clearly defined, tradeable, ar if
tranaacticn a,sts are lneiificant, then a direct aplicatia of the ase

principle i1d izply that ecuic efficixy is inenient of tether the
right to terminate an xployment relatihip at will, is originally assigr

to the ployer or to the ezployee. 1b illustrate this point, ider the

equiva1 of the foildx

exanplee.

In the firet eiiple, ezployers have the legal right to arbitrarily fire

apoyees at will. Suçe that ployees value protecticzi fx arbitrary
&th as arded by grievan proures at $100 per year, az
ployers value the cptiai to fire eloyeee arbitrarily (e.g., to avoid

significant relcnt in the le field of labor law during the past decade

blic policy, sxi as serving jury duty, filing a iorkers' cxsiçeration
claim, or reftsing to xmDit perjury (the "p.iblic policy excq,tion"). Serd,
nny state ts have held that an irplicit orntract exists between an

eployer ar his ip1oyees id birt the ployer to statEnts nde in
persc*,nel harooks, any rials or oral prcinises (the "in1i&1 xTtract
exo,tion"). Pbr exaix1e, s jurisdictia will k1d an tp1oyer liable for
danages if he or she fires an apl'ee so is abeent frczn work five tiiis if a
persca,nel harbook states that six a are regoired for a d1 ni 1.
Thixd, a minority of states have ruled in favor of loyees in unjustdi i4 1 cases unier the 1l theory that an iip1ied ooc.renant of good faith
ard fair dealing exists bebieen an ployee ard ip1oyer (the "good faith

ep.ion")

14

In esse, the good faith e),tion requires an loyer to

treat his 1oyees in a fair ard reasonable nner, whicth is the essere of a
just cause firir clause in a union orntract. An exançle of
a preent
ild be a cx*.irt ru1irx agai.nat a fixm that fired a worker for no other reason

bit to avoid paying the worker a thrisths bczis. The good faith exception is
prthably the ist redical departure frcin the trediticnal ai,loyment-at-will

doctrine because it I1ds aployers to a stazdard of behavior that is not
prescribed by piblic policy ard not set forth in an oral or written statant.

naticide survey of 260 wragful—tennination cases between January 1986 ard

Cctcer 1988 fcnd that in the 166 cases where eiployees were s.ssful, the
average award was $602,302, while the ivril award was $158,800. Both of

these surveys irdicate that the award distr±biticn is positively skewed.

Arther flzdixq of the rd survey is that the average t of litigation
by an eiployer in defliri an unjust-di n1

suit is $80, 073,

while the iril n legal fee is $65,000. In ition, litigation costs for
ezployees are typically basoil on a x*1tixqx!y of 40 percent of the award.

Evide is presented shcwin that ust-diisal legislatia is ztre
likely to be prcçosel in states where the darthre fran the treditional
rploymant—at-will doctrine by *he irts has been t extr. When

pztre1, this legislation is typically designed to limit xployer liability,

expedite dispute settlaints, red legal ts, ar clarify prqerty rights.
There is a sibiity, of xse, that at least initially unjust-diissal
legislation cild irrease urrtairity arxl disputes over prcperty rights.
As a practical matter, unjust-dii al legislation may be Pareto
superior to the withered etplayt-at-will doctrine. The aital eviderre
that
graipa in sa states actually suçort ani or unjustdi i 1 legislation to limit liability suggests that sixi "rx-fault-firirg"
legislation is a viable political ar1 &nical alternative to the

rt systen. If state zrts itin.ie to dilute the eçloymant-at-will
doctrine, the analysis presented in this paper ld predict that many states
will follcw )xitana by prcposin ani enactin legislation to limit ertployer

liability, clearly re-define prcçerty rights, aixl redi.e legal sts.
A natural estion to raise is, why has only a state been susful so
