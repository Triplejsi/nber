OF A MICRODYNAMIC NEOCLASSICAL MODEL OF FERTILITY

ABSTRACT
This article demonstrates the value of microdata for understanding the
effect of wages on life cycle fertility dynamics.

Conventional estimates of

neoclassical economic fertility models obtained from linear aggregate time
series regressions are widely criticized for being nonrobust when adjusted for
serial correlation.

Moreover,

the forecasting power of these aggregative

neoclassical models has been shown to be inferior when compared with
conventional time series models that assign no role to wages.
demonstrates,

that when neoclassical models of fertility are estimated on

microdata using methods that incorporate key demographic restrictions and when
they are properly aggregated, they have considerable forecasting power.

better than autoregressivemodels in predicting fertility rates for most
cohorts.

conclude this section with a brief discussion of the main empirical findings
from our previous work.

2.1

A

Stochastic Birth Process

A stochastic birth process model is the natural scheme for describing
fertility

dynamics.

The model represents the reproductive process in terms of

random waiting times between births.

The initial conditions of the process snd

the probability mechanism generating the waiting times between births completely

specify the model.
We use the hazard function (also called the occurrence rate) to characterize
the reproductive process. We assume that the sample paths of birth durations
conditional

on the regressors are absolutely continuous random variables (with

respect to Lebesgue measure),

so they have a well-defined conditional density.

To incorporate the effect of regressors, we model the conditional hazard, where

where the vector Z can include any known functions of the regressors. Yashin and
(1988) demonstrated that absolute continuity of conditional duration times

Arjas

is sufficient to justify the widely used exponential formula
connecting the

integrated conditional hazard function and the survivor function. They also
presenced alternative criteria that justify the exponential formula. Parity
dependence is incorporatedby estimating a separate set of coefficients for each
parity. The middle term on the right aide of equation (1) captures duration

dependence and encompasses common specificationa

frequently used in economics

and demography (Beckman and Walker 1987).
In our empirical analysis we also control for potential misspecification
errors cauaed by unobserved variables that, if measured, would be included in 2.
Fecundability,

which differs across women is a natural source of such variables.

We estimate birth process models using an extension of the nonparametric

likelihood estimator of Beckman and Singer (1984) to multiple spell models.

Hoem and Rennermsim (1985) documented the accuracy of the data.

The survey did not gather individual wage and income information.

To

circumvent this problem we construct for each gender a time series of income

using summary measures of personal tax returns by age for selected years
published by Statistics Sweden. The selected years are 1960, 1965, 1970, 1974,

1975, 1976, and 1977. We regress these income measures on calendar time toime to
generate a complete age-and gender-specific

time series of predicted annual

income. See appendix B of Beckman and Walker (1989) for more details. The

predicted male income series is used in our empirical analysis.

We use the

predicted female income series and annual hours of work information from the
Swedish Ferrility Survey to obtain an age-specific time series of female wage
rstes.

During the sample period (1948-1981), the Swedish labor market wss
characterizedby centralizedwage setting and explicit egalitarian wage
policies.

Operationally,

the wage policies compressed interindividual wage

variation by increasing the rate of growth of wages of low-wage workers
(primarily women) while reducing the rate of growth of wages of high-wage
workers and workers

in profitsble industries (Bjorklund 1986; Flanagan 1987).

This instirurional structure of wage determination has two important
implications for our microanalysis.

First, it implies that the observed

dramatic change in relative female wages from 65% to 90% of male wages in the
manufacturing sector during the period 1950-1980 is due to an exogenous force.
Second, it lends credibility to our use of aggregate wages

in an analysis of

individual fertility histories, since aggregate wage policy uniformly applied
accounts for much of the wage growth of individuals.
During the postwar period, the Swedish government enacted a variety of
proratal child care programs and other social programs designed to promote the
equality of the sexes in the marketplace and in the home. Many of these programs
were only available to working women (or to women who had some work experience)
and the benefits of such programs became increasingly more generous over the

course of our sample period. These programs tend to weaken the negative effect
of female wages on fertility. Higher-wage women are more likely to work and
6

hence qualify for child support payments.

2.3

Empirical

Evidence

In Heckman and Walker (1989) we present an extensive empirical analysia of
the individual fertility histories

found in the 1981 Swedish Fertility

Survey.

The beginning of the observational period is age 13 for all women. Our baseline
hazard specification

includes female wage and male income variables,

a set of

background variables that are intended to control for the initial conditions of
the fertility process and a parity-specific

mover-stayer representationof

unobserved heterogeneity or omitted variablea. Such a model allows unobservables
to assume two values. One value implies that the individual

does not go on to

have additional births. The other value implies that the woman may go on to have
additional births, For each parity we estimate the proportion of women of both
types and the value of the unobservable for the women who may go on to have
births. In Heckman and Walker (1989), we determine that this specification
unobservables

of

is the one that produces the best- fitting models, It is important

to note that this specification implies that unobservables are distributed
independently

across spells even for the same woman.

According to neoclassical theory and common sense, a woman's access to a
male partner's income is expected to have a positive effect on the probability
of her giving birth.

An increase in the female wage is expected to reduce the

probability of a birth. In the jargon of neoclassical economics,

the substitu-

tion effect dominates the income effect of a wage change on fertility.
Table I reports the estimated wage and income coefficients and associated

account for all births in Sweden and for all births in our sample. The pattern

7

of the estimeted coefficients in Table 1 is representative of the
many models we
fit.

Notice that the estimated wage and income effects are consistent with

neoclassical theory. Estimated femsle wage effects are statistically significanc
and numerically important in explaining the timing and spacing of births. Higher
wages lead to fewer births and to the postponement of births. In results
reported in our companion paper, we find that these estimated wage effects are
robust to the inclusion or exclusion of education, marital status, time trend,
age, unemployment,

and policy variables.

Estimated male wage effects are also

consistent with neoclassical theory but are less robust to the inclusion or
exclusion of marital status variables. Higher male income leads to more births
and closer spacing of births.

Our estimates

are robust to the inclusion or

exclusion of other control variables.
We also estimate models using a second time series of
wages-gender-specific

wage series
suggests that interpolation

in the first series produces little bias. Models

using the second wage series, however, fail goodness-of-fit

tests.

In a limited Monte Carlo study we investigate and reject the hypothesis
that our estimated wage effects are the result of an errors-in-variables
arising from using aggregated instead of individual wages and income.

We assess its
In absolute terms,

This comparison is an

absolute measure of the performance of the birth process model, since a

and the movement over time of aggregate birth rates.

To measure the forecasting

ability of the micromodel in relative terms we compare the within- sample mean
squared error of its predicted annual birth rates with that obtained from
autoregressivemodels fir on aggregate data. The recent work of McDonald (1981)
suggests

that autoregressive

moving average (ARMA) models without economic

variables dominate linear neoclassical models on a mean squared error criterion.
We investigate whether this dominance relationship also applies to the
aggregated version of our estimated nonlinear microdynamic model of fertility.

Wage and income variables are age and period specific (described in text).
Other covariatea included in the specification: urban (a dummy variable
which equals one if the respondent was raised in an urban area) and white
collar (a dummy variable which equals one if the respondent's father had a
white collar job).

Note:aThia MSE is computed by taking the sum of the squared
difference between the logit of sample birth rates and the
logit of predicted birth rates and dividing by the number of
annual observations. Periods with no sample births are deleted
to make the logit transform well defined. They are always initial
periods for each cohort.
