PUBLIC CONFIDENCE AND DEBT MANACEMENT: A MODEL AND A CASE STUDY OF ITALY

ABSTRACT

If
High debt countries may face the risk of self-fulfilling debt crises.
the public expects that in the future the government will be unable to roll
over the maturing debt, they may refuse to buy debt today and choose to hold

foreign assets. This lack of confidence may then be self-fulfilling. This
paper argues that under certain conditions, the occurrence of a confidence
crisia is more likely if the average maturity of the debt is short. On the
contrary, a long and evenly distributed maturity structure may reduce such a
risk. We consider the recent Italian experience from this perspective. In
particular we ask whether recent develnpmencs in che market for government debt
ahoy signa of unstable public confidence, and of a risk premium.

Introduction
With a public debt projected to remain close to 100% of CNP for several

years

in the future, the Italian authorities face two goals:

low as possible;

to guarantee monetary and

financial stability while carrying out the financial liberalization required
by the EEC accords. This paper investigates the role of public debt
management in the achievement of these two goals.
Section II of the paper briefly summarizes the debt management policies
followed in Italy during the l9BOs.

Even though in the first half of the

decade these policies were quite successful,

they may have planted the seeds

for the difficulties of the Summer of 1987, which marked a turning point.

Section III asks whether the return on the

Italian public debt currently incorporates a premium against the risk of a
confidence crisis, or more generally of a government default. This is a
difficult question,
and not conclusive.

However,

we do find some evidence that such a premium may

Section IV analyzes a simple model that begins to address some of the
questions relating to debt management and confidence crises.

The central

result is that the maturity structure of public debt may influence the

Finally,

Section V concludes the paper with a discussion of some

implications of our model about debt management policies.

II.

Management in

Italy During the 198QA

As shown in Figure 1, Italy approached the l980s with a short and
rapidly
declining maturity of public debt:

In 1981, about 60% of the debt had a

maturity of less than a year; the average maturity of the whole debt
outstanding was less than one and a half years.
nominal domestic debt.

Virtually all of it was

Investors had suffered capital losses during the late

1970s, due to rising inflation and high nominal interest rates.

Afraid of

repeating the same mistakes, they were reluctant to hold long—term fixed
interest nominal debt (see Pagano <1988)).
In order to lengthen the maturity of public debt, the authorities could
choose between three instruments:

foreign currency debt, debt indexed to the

price level, or debt indexed to some short—term nominal interest rate.

The

fourth option, fixed nominal interest debt, would have demanded an
excessively
high premium against the inflation risk.

The authorities opted heavily for

the third alternative. As indicated in Table 1, between 1982 and 1987
they
increased

considerably the net issues of CCT (Treasury Credit Certificates),

medium—term notes whose coupons are indexed to the returns on 6—months or 1—
year Treasury Bills (TB).

As shown in Figure

1,

they succeeded in lengthening

the average maturity of government debt from a minimum of 14 months in 1982 to
a maximum of almost 4 years in the summer of 1987.

The authorities preferred financial indexation to price

level indexation

on the grounds that the latter would have reduced the Treasury's incentives to
fiscal adjustment and it would have affected the credibility of their anti—
inflationary policy (an essential part of which was a reduction of wage
indexation).

These concerns are clearly indicated

in the 1981 "concluding

remarks' of the Governor of the Bank of Italy (see Banca d'Italia 1981).
Other less compelling reasons have been suggested to explain this choice

in favor of CCT.

It has been argued that financial indexation is preferred by

the investor to price level

demands a lower premium, because it protects against inflation risk as well as
against changes in the short—term real interest rate.

Both rates display a common declining trend that reflects a

111.2 Interest Differentials on Medium/Long—TermDebt
The possibility of a risk premium on the Italian government debt can also

be investigated by comparing the yield on ECU denominated government bonds
(CTE) with the average yield of ECU bonds of corresponding maturity (4—8
years).

Figure 9 indicates

that the yield net of taxes on the Italian bonds

was higher on average than the yield on ECU bonds.

The differential

diminished and almost disappeared in 1987; since 1988, however, we can note
again a premium on CTE.

This evidence is again consistent with the view that

the risk premium varies inversely with the average maturity of the debt.

Note

that the yield on CTE is net of taxes while that on ECU bonds is gross of
taxes, so that the after—tax differential should be even more favorable

to

CTE.

Figure 10 shows the interest differential at issue between 2—3 years BTP
and 18—24 month certificates of deposit issued by special credit institutions.
The differential is always favorable to the BTPs with peaks in 1987 and in the
first months of 1989.

The differential

is even more remarkable if one

considers that 1988 was a boom year for the certificates of deposit of the
special credit institutions:

in spite of the differential,

this kind of CDs

increased by 41% with respect to 1987.
Summarizing,

this evidence suggests that private investors may fear a

confidence crisis on the Italian public debt.

We now turn to a theoretical

model that analyzes how such a crisis might take place.

IV,

A Model of Debt Runs
The basic result of this section is that a crisis of confidence in the

public debt can be self—fulfilling, like a bank run; but it is less likely to
occur if the public debt has a long and balanced maturity structure.

Introduction and Review of the Literature

IV.l

The idea that there may be an analogy between a bank run and a run on

government debt has a long tradition, but the most recent treatment is in
Calvo (1988).

This author studies a two period model of a small open economy:

If the government repudiates its debt, it bears a cost proportional to the

amount repudiated.

Calvo shows that two equilibria exist:

a "good"

equilibrium in which the government honors its debt, and a "bad" equilibrium,
in which investors expect the government to partially repudiate and demand a
higher interest rate, and the government fulfills these expectations.

Calvo's

"bad" equilibrium is similar to the banking panic studied by Diamond and

Dybvig (1983); it reflects a coordination problem among investors making
simultaneous portfolio decisions.
investors

If an investor expects all the other

to demand a risk premium, he realizes that the government will be

forced to partially repudiate in the future; thus, his optimal response is
also to demand a risk premium.
The confidence crisis that we study in this paper,

instead, reflects a

coordination problem among individuals making investment decisions
different dates.

public debt, in the anticipation that future investors will do likewise,

and

A second difference between Calvo's

model and ours is in the specification of the Costs of default.

These

differences imply that in our model, unlike in Calvo's, the
larger is the
stock of debt maturing in a given period, the
greater is the range of
parameter values for which a crisis can occur.

This feature of our model

provides a role for debt management.
Giavazzi and Pagano (this volume) derive results related to ours.
However, in their paper, unlike in ours, the policy that gives rise to the
debt run is not derived from the government optimization
problem but is
postulated exogenously. In addition, they focus on repudiation by means of
exchange rate devaluation;

whereas, we consider outright repudiation.

Prati

(1989) models a confidence crisis along lines similar to this
paper, but
focuses on nominal debt and
disregards debt management.
