WHAT DO RICH COUNTRIES TRADE WITH EACH OTHER?
R&D AND THE COMPOSITION OF U.S. AND SWEDISH TRADE
ABSTRACT

A long tradition in international economics explains comparative advantage by differences between countries in their stage of development, or their
endowments of land, labor, and capital, and suggests that universal development will reduce the importance of trade.

Sweden and the United States

possess similar factor endowments and have converged in overall productivity,
but their bilateral trade has grown.

The example of these two countries

suggests that mutual technological progress may promote trade, with the new
basis for specialization being the different technology levels or R&D intensities of the goods being traded, rather than the initial endowments.
