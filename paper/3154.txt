STOCK MARKET FORECASTABILITY AND VOLATILITY:

A STATISTICAL APPRAISAL

ABSTRACT
This paper presents and implements statistical tests of stock market
forecastability and volatility that are immune from the severe statistical
problems of earlier tests.

Although the null hypothesis of strict market

efficiency is rejected, the evidence against the hypothesis is not
overwhelming.

That is, the data do not provide evidence of gross violations

of the conventional valuation model.
