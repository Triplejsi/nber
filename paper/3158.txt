COMMODITY PRICES AND INFLATION: EVIDENCE
FROM SEVEN LARGE INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the relationships between movements in primary
commodity prices and changes in inflation in the large industrial countries.
It begins by developing a two-country model in order to examine the theoretical
effects of monetary, fiscal, and supply-side diturbances on commodity and
manufactures prices and on exchange rates. It is shown that if monetary shocks
dominate, then commodity prices should lead general price movements, and the
level of commodity prices should be correlated with the general inflation rate.
Non-monetary shocks generally weaken these relationships, but such disturbances
may cancel out for broad indexes covering a wide range of commodities.
Country-specific commodity price indexes are developed for the major
industrial countries. The weights assigned to different commodities vary
substantially across countries. Nonetheless, when the indexes are expressed in
a common currency, they tend to be highly correlated over time, except when
sharp movements occur in certain commodity prices. The major source of
contrast across countries in the behavior of the indexes derives from exchange
rate movements.
Several empirical tests broadly support the conclusions of the theoretical
model, with relatively few differences across countries. Three main tendencies
may be cited. First, low inflation in industrial countries has tended to be
associated with low levels of commodity prices, and conversely; commodity-price
levels are cointegrated with consumer-price inflation rates. Second, there has
been some tendency for movements in commodity prices to precede changes in
general inflation rates by a few months, although it is not clear whether this
tendency is strong enough to be a reliable aid in forecasting the rate of
inflation. Third, there is a strong and fairly reliable tendency for turning
points in general inflation rates. Commodity prices thus appear to contribute
to predictions of turning points in inflation, predictions of inflation rates
but more strongly to predictions of turning points in inflation.

I. Introduction and SummarY
Considerable interest has arisen regarding the relationship between

commodity prices and broader measures of inflationary pressures. An
earlier paper (Boughton and Branson, 1988) argued that a conventional
trade-weighted index of world commodity prices contains useful information
about future changes in the average inflation rate in large industrial

countries. This paper extends that research in two directions: (I) by
developing a theoretical open-economy model in which countries differ in
the role that is played by commodity prices; and (2) by deriving commodity
price indexes that are specific to each country and testing the relationships between those indexes and inflation in the countries concerned.
Section II describes the theoretical model and suggests a number of

hypotheses to be tested. A conclusion of this section is that commodity
price movements should lead general price movements as long as

disturbances are predominantly monetary. If commodity prices jump in
response to such disturbances, while other prices respo more gradually,
then the level of commodity prices should be positively correlated (and

cointegrated) with the rate of inflation in manufactures prices. These
conclusions should apply more to broad commodity price indexes, on which
the effects of supply shocks to specific commodities are relatively weak,

than to narrow indexes. Even so, unaccommodated fiscal policies and other
general real disturbances could create substantial noise in the
relationships between general price inflation and movements in broad
commodity price indexes.

The new commodity price indexes are presented and discussed in
Section III. The distribution of weights among commodities varies

-2-

markedly across countries, but as long as the indexes are denominated in
the same currency the variation in their intertemporal movements is

limited. The major source of contrast in the behavior of the individualcountry indexes derives from exchange rate movements.
Empirical tests of the relationships between the commodity price
indexes and general inflation rates are the subject of Sections IV and V.
Section IV presents some cointegration tests that suggest the possibility
that the level of commodity prices may be cointegrated with the rate of
inflation in consumer prices; that is, low inflation in industrial
countries appears to be associated with low levels of commodity prices,

and conversely. Various single-equation tests of predictive power
indicate that there is some tendency for movements in commodity prices to
precede consumer price changes and to contribute to inflation predictions;
this tendency, however, is not observed in all countries, nor in all time

periods. Commodity price indexes have a stronger predictive relationship
with turning points in consumer price inflation than with the level of the
inflation rate.

Section V discusses evidence regarding the relationship between

commodity prices and output deflators. No evidence is found to support
the hypothesis that the linkages with output deflators are stronger in
countries that have a relatively large share of output attributed to

primary commodities. In general, commodity prices contribute to
predictions of output deflators with slightly less power than in the case

of consumer prices. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of some
econometric model simulations that broadly confirm the major predictions
of the theoretical model and the single-equation tests.

II. A Two-Country Model of Commodity Prices, Exchange Rates,
and Inflation
This section presents a dynamic model of commodity and industrial

prices in a framework of two goods and two countries. The goods are
commodities and manufactures, with their prices determined in a world

market in a common currency, the Group Currency Unit (GCU). jJ The two
countries have a floating exchange rate and different structures of pro-

duction. The exchange rate of each against the GCU translates the prices
of the two goods into the home currencies. The weights of the two goods
in production and consumption in each country then determine the movements

of the GNP deflator and the CPI, respectively. The model has two levels.
The world market (subsection 1) determines the relative goods prices,
while a relative monetary model (subsection 2) determines exchange rates.
The two together give home-currency prices.
1.

World model of commodities and manufactures Drices
This subsection discusses a dynamic model of the interaction of

commodity and manufactures prices at the level of the world market.
Commodity prices are determined in flexible world markets with forward-

looking expectations. Manufactures prices are set by sellers and adjust
gradually. The model is essentially the same as the one presented in
Boughton and Branson (1988), interpreted now as a world model in GCU.
Equilibrium in the world money market is described in the standard
form of equation (1):

1/ Conceptually, the GCU is an implicit weighted average of the two
currencies. It is defined for the general multi-country case in Boughton
and Branson (1988).

-4(1) m-apm- (1- a)pC—y- Ai.
Here m, p, P and y are the logarithms of nominal world money, the price
of manufactures, the price of commodities, and world real output, all
expressed in GCU; i is the average world nominal short-term interest
rate; and a is the share of manufactures in world output, and in the world
CPI. Coimnodity price inflation and the interest rate are related by the
arbitrage condition:

(2) ic+b,
where b is the real return to holding commodities for final use, net of

storage costs, and c is the exDected rate of change of the commodity
price. Substitution of equation (2) into (1) yields the first dynamic
equation:

The downward-sloping locus of points where c — 0 is shown in Figure 1;
its slope is -(1 -

For a point above the
equilibrium, Pc must

be

expected to rise. This is because above the line,

c is higher, and real balances are lower, than on it, so the interest

rate must exceed b, and c must therefore be expected to rise. If expectations exhibit perfect foresight, Pc must actually be rising above the

line. These dynamics of the GGU commodity price are summarized by the
horizontal arrows in Figure 1.

The supply of real industrial output y is assumed to be- constant.
Demand is assumed to be an increasing function of the price of commodities

relative to manufactures, c/m' and a decreasing function of the real
interest rate in terms of manufactures. Thus demand is given by

where g is the logarithm of exogenous expenditure, which can represent

aggregate world fiscal policy. We assume that a fiscal expansion
increases the relative demand for industrial goods.

The price of manufactures is assumed to adjust gradually to eliminate

The terms in Pm can be consolidated to yield the second dynamic equation:

+ g - ym]

This term must be positive if a positive shock to

excess demand is to raise the price of manufactures.
The positively sloped jim. —

0 line in Figure 1 is the locus of points

along which excess demand for manufactured goods is zero, given the value
of the world money stock, which influences the world nominal interest

rate i. The slope is less than unity because an increase in the price
level raises the interest rate and reduces the demand for manufactured

output, At points above the ji — 0 line, there is an excess world supply
of manufactured goods, and their CGU price is falling, assuming t > 0.

Below the line, there is excess demand and the price is rising. The

-6-

dynamics of adjustment of the GCTJ

manufactured price are summarized by the

vertical arrows in Figure 1.

The intersection of the two equilibrium lines in Figure 1 gives the
equilibrium pair of GCU world prices for given world money stock, fiscal
policy, and real supply conditions. ),j Dynamic adjustment to the equi-

librium proceeds along the stable saddle path as. This path has two

essential properties: it leads to the equilibrium (technically satisfies
the transversality conditions implicit in the model), and along it the

expected rate of change of the commodity price is realized. All other
paths with expectations realized from period to period explode away from
the equilibrium; they are speculative bubbles. The assumption that the
market seeks out the stable ss path following a disturbance is the same as
assuming that speculative bubbles are unsustainable.

The model of Figure 1 can be used to show the potential usefulness of

movements of commodity prices as an indicator of future inflation. Consider an unanticipated increase in the world money supply, originating in

either country. In the long run, both prices would increase proportion-

ately in GCU. Thus in Figure 1 both the

— 0 and the

— 0 lines shift

out, so that the long-run equilibrium moves out proportionately. This is
shown as the movement from point 0 to point 2 in Figure 2, which also

shows the new ss path into the new equilibrium. The commodity price can
adjust instantaneously to reflect the expected inflation, while the manu-

-7faccures

price can adjust only over time. Thus in Figure 2, the flexible

commodity price jumps Onto the new ss path at point 1, and then the two

prices adjust gradually along the ss path to point 2. In response to an
unanticipated monetary shock, commodity prices jump and overshoot, and
lead the subsequent inflation in industrial prices.
In response to repeated monetary shocks, jumps in the level of commodity prices would lead changes in the rate of inflation of industrial

prices. This should produce a positive correlation between the j
of world GCU commodity prices and the subsequent rate of inflation of
manufactures prices if repeated monetary disturbances are empirically

important. Cointegration of the level of commodity prices and the rate of
inflation in consumer prices is not rejected in the statistical tests in
Section IV (Table 4), below.

The effects of an unanticipated real disturbance that changes the

equilibrium relative price Ps/Pc are shown in Figure 3. There we assume
that the disturbance increases the equilibrium relative price. This could
be due to a supply shock that increases commodity supply relative to the
supply of manufactures; for example, an innovation in commodity produc-

tion. It could also result from a shift in demand toward manufactures;
for example, a fiscal expansion. This disturbance shifts the
up along the

Pm — 0 line

— 0 line to a new long-run equilibrium at point 2, which

lies on a steeper ray from the origin that characterizes a higher Pm/Pc

ratio. If there is no monetary accommodation to the disturbance, the

0 line does not move. The result is that the commodity price jumps
down onto the new ss path at point 1, and then continues to fall, while
the industrial price rises to the new equilibrium at point 2. The corn-

-8-

modity price undrshoots in response to a real disturbance. It moves
before the industrial price, but in the opposite direction. With no

monetary accommodation, for the m/c ratio to rise, m must increase and
must fall.

It could appear from this analysis that commodity prices would not
be a useful indicator of future inflation in the presence of unaccommo-

dated real disturbances. In fact, in this model, as long as the real
disturbance is not accommodated, there is no general inflation. As one
price rises, the other falls to keep the weighted CPI in GCU constant.
Thus a stochastic series of aggregate real shocks would produce stochastic

behavior of the commodity price with no general inflation. If in empirical implementation we use an index of a variety of commodity prices, real
supply shocks would come from differing sources, depending on the commod-

ity. To the extent that these are independent, offsetting negative and
positive disturbances at the individual coimnodity level would minimize

the contribution of supply shocks to the variance of the index. Thus the
path of the index would be dominated by monetary disturbances, with real

disturbances producing noise around that path. The contribution of real
supply shocks to the variance of the index would be minimized to the

extent that they are uncorrelated. This would improve the usefulness of
the index as an inflation indicator.

At this point we can summarize the results from the world model of
commodity and manufactures prices in GCU. Monetary disturbances lead to
jumps in the commodity price index, followed by gradual movement in the

manufactures price in the same direction. The long run movement of both
prices is proportional to the monetary disturbance. Thus a series of

-9-

positive monetary shocks would produce a series of jumps in the level of
commodity prices and smoother inflation in manufactures prices, with a

common trend to both. Real disturbances yield jumps in the commodity
price, followed by gradual movement of the manufactures price in the

opposite direction. If the real disturbances are not accommodated by
monetary policy, they have no long-run effect on the CPI, but they produce

noise in the commodity price series. If the real disturbances have in
them a trend that raises the relative price of manufactures, they will
generate noise around that trend.

Relative model of prices and exchanae rates
The world model gives us the movements of commodity and manufactures

prices in GCIJ, as functions of world monetary and real disturbances. To
translate these into domestic price indexes in individual countries, we
can use a model of the exchange rate and relative price levels between

two countries. This will give us the relative effects of disturbances,
depending on the country of their source. The relative effects can then
be combined with the world effects in GCU to obtain the results for CPIs

and GDP deflators in home currencies. The relative model is an application of Aoki's (1981) average and difference method to the Dornbusch
(1976) model of prices and the exchange rate.

We begin by defining relative variables between two "representative"
countries as the differences between the logarithms of the variables for
the domestic GNP deflators, money stocks, CNPs, and fiscal variables; and

the aritbmeticdifferences for interest rates, with each relative variable
being the standard mnenonic with a subscript "r". Thus for relacive

are the home and foreign GNP deflators, respectively.

Relative money stocks (mr), real GNP (yr)' and fiscal variables (ge) are

The model of relative prices and the exchange rate is specified
similarly to the model of manufactures and commodity prices described

above in subsection 1. Here the exchange rate is the forward-looking
variable that jumps in response to unanticipated disturbances, and the

relative GNP deflator adjusts slowly to relative excess demand. The

This is because Pr jS higher than on the line, so 1-r must be positive

above the line. This would mean that E would be expected to rise (so

is

positive), and on the assumption of perfect foresight, E would actually

rise. This reasoning is exactly the same as that behind the P dynamics

The two equilibrium lines in Figure 4 show the equilibrium relative
price, measured in the ratio of the two currencies, and the equilibrium
exchange rate at point 0 for given relative money stocks, fiscal posi-

tions, and supply conditions. Dynamic adjustment to equilibrium proceeds

along the saddle path ss, as in the earlier model of Figure 1. The only
analytical difference between Figure 1 and Figure 4 is the slope of the

curve representing monetary equilibrium. In both models, the saddle path
is negatively sloped, and the flexible price jumps horizontally onto the
saddle path following an unanticipated disturbance, while the sticky price
adjusts gradually along the saddle path.
The effects of a strictly relative monetary disturbance (an increase
in the money supply in the home country and a decrease of the same percent

in the foreign country) are shown in Figure 5. There is no change at the
world level of subsection 1, since there is no effect on the world money

stock. But in the relative model, the long run equilibrium moves Out proportionately to point 2 in Figure 5, with the exchange rate and relative
price both increasing in proportion to the change in the relative money

supply. The home price level rises and the foreign price level declines.
The home currency depreciates against the GCIJ and the foreign currency

appreciates. In the short run, the exchange rate between the two countries jumps to point 1 on the new ss path, and then the exchange rate

falls and the relative price rises to point 2. This is the basic result
from Dornbusch (1976) for two countries.

The effects of a strictly relative fiscal disturbance, an increase

in gr in equation (10), are shown in Figure 6. We assume that the home
government increases, and the other government decreases, expenditure on

manufactures by the same amount. There is no change in the world market
in manufactures or commodities, but in the relative model, the r — 0
line in Figure 6 shifts up. The equilibrium relative price level of the
home country, where the fiscal expansion took place, increases for a given
level of the exchange rate.

There is no shift of the

— 0 line, since

the fiscal variable does not enter the money-market equilibrium condition,

equation (7). As a result, the exchange rate falls in a jump from point
o to point 1 in Figure 6. The home currency appreciates by enough to
offset the effect of the fiscal shift on relative demand, with no effect

on either price level in home currency. The nominal appreciation of the
home currency produces a real appreciation of the same amount. This
result is implicit in Dornbusch (1976), and explicit in Mundell (1963).
3.

The two models combined
The model of the world markets in commodities and manufactures in

GCU and the relative model of exchange rates and relative prices in home
currencies can now be combined to analyze the effects of the various types

of unanticipated disturbances originating in one country. We will
consider, in turn, monetary, fiscal, and supply shocks.
Monetary ExDansion in One Country
First we illustrate the effects of an unanticipated monetary expan-

sion in one country. At the level of the world model of commodity and
manufactures prices, the results are illustrated in Figure 2. Measured in
GCU, the commodity price jumps, and then the mawfactures price rises
gradually, as the commodity price falls. The jump in the level of the
commodity price leads the gradual increase in the manufactures price.

- 14

Eventually

-

both prices rise proportionately to the increase in the money

stock, all measured in GCU.

The relative effect is shown in Figure 5. The exchange rate of the
expanding country against the second country jumps from point 0 to point

1; that is, the expanding country's currency depreciates. Subsequently,
that country's price level in home currency rises and its exchange rate

falls, converging to point 2. In the new long-run equilibrium, the
exchange rate and the price level in the expanding country rise
proportionately to the monetary expansion.

Fiscal

-

Exysnsion in One Country

The interesting case of an unanticipated fiscal expansion is one that
alters world relative demand for manufactures snd commodities, as well as

the real exchange rate as shown in Figure 6. To use a specific example,
consider a fiscal expansion in the manufacturing country that increases

the world relative demand for manufactures. As a convenient simplification, think of this country as Japan, and the other country, specializing

in commodities production, as Italy. j/ The effects at the world level
in CCIJ are shown in Figure 3. The commodity price jumps down, and then

declines gradually further as the manufactures price rises. At the new

equilibrium point 2, m has risen and c has fallen, in GCU.
The relative effects are shown in Figure 6. With no direct representation of the fiscal variable in the financial equilibrium equation (7),
the

— 0 line does not move. The fiscal expansion in Japan shifts the

— 0 line left, moving the equilibrium point from 0 to 1 in a jump. The

home real and nominal exchange rates appreciate, with no change in rela-

tive GDP deflators, in home currency. The appreciation of the yen just
offsets the increase in m in GCIJ, and the depreciation of the lira just

offsets the fall in c

GCU.

The effects of the fiscal expansion in the manufacturing country on
prices in all three currencies are summarized in panel (a) of Table 1.

m is up and c is down, in GCU. m in lira rises both because of the
increase in GCU and because of the depreciation of the lira against the

GCU, while in yen m is unchanged. Pc is unchanged in lira, while it
falls in yen both from the fall in GCU and from the yen appreciation.
Thus if both countries consume both goods, the CPI will fall in Japan and
rise in Italy, reflecting the terms-of-trade effect, with both GDP
deflators unchanged.

SupDly Expansion in One Country
A supply shock also alters the world relative prices, as in Figure 3,

and the equilibrium real exchange rate. The analysis is slightly more
complicated than that of a fiscal expansion, though, since both equilib-

rium lines in Figure 6 shift with a supply shock. Consider an increase in
productivity in the commodity-producing country (Italy) that increases the

world relative supply of commodities. The effects at the level of the
world market in CCIJ are again shown in Figure 3. The commodity price
jumps down from point 0 to point 1 when the supply increase becomes known

to the market. Then Pc falls gradually as m rises to point 2. In GCU
the price of commodities falls and the price of manufactures rises.

The relative effects are shown in Figure 7, with Italy as the home

country. The productivity shock increases Yr in both equations (7) and

(10), shifting both equilibrium lines down. The r — 0 line shifts down
by a factor of -1/8 from equation (10), and the — 0 line shifts down by

from equation (7). If the shift in the r — 0 line is sufficiently

-

larger than the shift in the — 0 line, the new saddle path will pass to
the right of the original equilibrium point 0, as shown in Figure 7. This
would be the case if the supply shock's effects were felt mainly in the
goods markets, compared with the effects in the money market via an

increase in income. In this case, the exchange rate of Italy would jump

up to point 1, and then rise further as r falls to point 2. That is, the
lira would depreciate in both nominal and real tens against the CCU.
One cannot rule Out the possibility that the downward shift in the
—

0 line would be large enough that the new saddle path would pass to

the left of point 0.

In that case the exchange rate could jump down, and

then rise as 1'r fell to the new equilibrium. Equation (10) shows that in
the new equilibrium the real exchange rate (e increase in Yr by d(e -

must rise with an

We know, therefore, that in Figure

7, along the new equilibrium line r — 0 the lira has depreciated in real
terms, regardless of the direction of its original jump. So the result
from the relative model is that the real. exchange rate of the country with

the positive supply shock rises (home currency depreciates) relative to
the CCU, and the other country's real exchange rate falls.

The results for the positive supply shock in the commodity-producing

country are summarized in panel (b) of Table 1. The price of commodities
falls and the price of manufactures rises in GCIJ. With the lira

- 18

depreciating

-

in real terms, the lirs price of manufactures rises even

more, and the lira price of commodities falls less than in OCU. As the
yen appreciates in real terms, the yen price of commodities falls even

more, and the yen price of manufactures rises less, than in CCU. With the
two prices moving in opposite directions in both currencies, the effects

on the two CPIs are ambiguous. However, since the movement in the real
exchange rate adds to the downward movement in commodity prices inJapan,
and to the upward movement of manufactures prices in Italy, it seems
likely the the CPI would fall in Japan and rise in Italy.
Summary
The effects of the unanticipated disturbances in single countries are

summarized in panel (c) of Table 1. The effects of an unanticipated
expansion in the money supply are familiar. In the home country, prices
rise proportionately to the expansion. The currency of the foreign
country appreciates, and local currency prices in the foreign country are

unchanged. In this case the commodity price jumps and leads a general
inflation in the home country.

The effects of a fiscal expansion or a supply shock are less

familiar. A fiscal expansion in the manufacturing country that raises
world relative demand for manufactures raises the CCU price of manufac-

tures and reduces the GCU price of commodities. It also appreciates the
currency of the expanding country and depreciates the currencies of the

others, in nominal and real terms. The result is a negative effect on the
CPI in the expanding country and a positive effect on the others, owing to

the movement of the exchange rate. This is similar to the effect of the
fiscal expansion in the United States on the U.S. inflation rate via the

exchange rate in the early 1980s. In this case the downward jump

in the commodity price following the disturbance contains no general
signal for inflation unless it includes a general shift in monetary

policy. If unaccommodated fiscal disturbances are randomly distributed
across countries and over time, they will create noise in the relation
between commodity price movements and subsequent inflation.
Finally, a positive supply shock lowers the price of the good whose
supply has increased and depreciates the currency of the suppliers in real

terms. The net result is to reduce the price of the good in question, and
increase the prices of the others, in all currencies. The effects on
home-currency CPIs deperd on the weights of the goods in the CPI. In this
case the initial downward jump in the GCU commodity price also contains no

signal for subsequent inflation. By using an index over a large number of
commodities, individual supply shacks such as these are averaged Out to
some degree in the empirical work that follows.

III. Country-Specific Commodity Price Indexes
The empirical tests developed in Sections IV and V of this paper
evaluate the relationships between general movements in world prices of

primary commodities and inflation in the large industrial countries. In
order to isolate the effects of global developments on individual countries, it is necessary to develop separate commodity-price indexes for

each country. This task has two disensious: determining the weights that
each commodity should have in a country's index, and denominating the

index in that country's currency. The first dimension is at least potentially important in order to take account of variation between countries
in the shares of key commodities in consumption patterns; the second

- 20 -

ensures that the commodity-price and general-price indexes are denominated
in the same currency units.

-.

The commodity-price indexes have been constructed using spot prices
for major commodities and weights that reflect the pattern of consumption

of these commodities in each country. A large number of price quotations
are included (thirty-one primary commodities represented by thirty-six
international price quotations), in order to minimize the effects of price
fluctuations caused by supply shocks or other real disturbances in

individual commodity markets. Weights are based on consumption, rather
than production or imports, since these relate most directly to movements
in the consumer price index.

-

-

Table 2 provides a comparison of patterns of consumption of primary
commodities in the seven major industrial countries. ./ These data
indicate that the portion of total private consumption attributed to the

consumption of primary commodities J is quite uniform among countries, at
about 8 percent (second row of Table 2). Consumption of individual
commodities, however, varies substantially from country to country. For
example, while the consumption of grains is relatively constant as a share
of primary consumption for most countries (about 14 percent except for
Germany), the composition of grain consumption is more diversified.
Weights representing the consumption of wheat in France, Italy, and the
United Kingdom (each 10 percent); maize- in the United States (11 percent);

the 31 selected primary commodities to the value of total private

and rice in Japan (9 per"ent) are significantly higher than average
consumption of these commodities by the group of seven countries.
Similarly, beef consumption is relatively low in Japan (2.4 percent)

and Germany (9.4 percent), compared with the group (12.4 percent); these
two countries consume relatively more seafood and pork products, respec-

tively, which are not included in the indexes. j/ Tea consumption, as
might be expected, is relatively high in the United Kingdom (1.9 percent),

as is coffee consumption in Germany (3.8 percent). The relatively low
level of consumption of timber products in Italy (5.9 percent) reflects a
preference for stone and cement in housing construction, compared with a
greater preference for timber in construction in Germany (20.3 percent).
There is remarkable consistency in the share of consumption of primary commodities attributed to petroleum, which- -at roughly 38 percent- -

ia

the largest of any commodity by far. Weights for petroleum were based on
consumption and import unit values in 1986, rather than the 1983-85

average that was used for all other commodities. This ad hoc procedure
is intended to avoid overstating the importance of petroleum, in light of
the very sharp decline in oil prices that occurred in 1986 and again in
1988.

-

A caveat on the estimates of the pattern of consumption in the large
industrial countries relates to the difficulty in separating end-use
consumption of primary commodities from intermediate use in the production

of other primary commodities or manufactured products for export. Some

j,J Broadly representative and timely price series are not available for
seafood or pork products.
/ The use of average 1983-85 data would give a weight to petroleum of

- 23

adjustments were made to consumption values to avoid double counting of
commodities at various stages of production, such as in the production of

soybean and timber products. j/ It was not generally possible, however,
to adjust for the consumption of one commodity in the production of
another. Hence there is some double counting for all countries, on account
of maize and soybean meal used as cattle feed, and phosphate rock used in
the production of grains, soybeans, and fibers.
Consumption weights also may be overestimated for a few commodities
in countries where there are significant exports of finished manufactures.
Relatively high weights for metals in Japan (16.4 percent) and Germany
(13.3 percent) compared with the group average (9.7 percent) reflect a
greater rate of production of automobiles, more than half of which are

exported. Relatively high weights for hides in Italy (3.3 percent) and
sugar and cocoa in Germany (about 2 percent each) reflect the production

of shoes and confectionery for export in these countries. The bias in
the indexes caused by overestimated weights may not extend to the estimation of weights for the group of countries, however, since manufactures
exported by one country are often imported by another country in the

group. In addition, some underestimation of weights occurs, when commod-

J

The consumption weights in Table 1 were modified to prevent double
counting of soybeans and soybean meal production; logs, timber, plywood,
and paperboard production; and tobacco and cigarette production. The last
two adjustments were needed to account for the export of commodities at a
higher value-added level (principally plywood and paper exports from
Canada and cigarette exports from the United States).

are imported at an advanced stage of production from outside the

group of seven countries. j/

-

A comparison of commodity price indexes, using weights from Table 2

and denominating commodity prices in a common currency, is presented in

Chart 1. A casual inspection reveals the indexes to be quite similar,
despite the differences in weights used to construct them. In particular,
indexes for all countries that include large, similar weights for petroleum are found to he roughly identical, with only minor variations evident

in the indexes that exclude petroleum. These variations, in turn, are
caused by the presence or absence of large weights for commodities whose
prices moved differently than did prices of the group.

As examples of differences in movements in prices, indexes for most
countries rose in 1973-74 to 80 percent or more of their respective 1980
levels, largely owing to a more than doubling of grain prices from 1972.
The exception to this was the price index for Germany, which remained
below 80, on account of a weight for grains equal to roughly one half of

that in other countries. Other distinctive movements in Germany's index
include a sharp, extended rise in the index during 1978-80, owing in part
to a doubling of the internationsl price of logs, and a subsequent rise in
1988, to well over 100 percent of the 1980 level, again related to a rise

/

An example of underestimation of weights is given by iron ore, which
is often imported and consumed as steel products. An adjustment to the
iron ore weight to account for the import of steel products is difficult
because of the variety of these products and their high value-added
component; the value of steel at an advanced stage of production (cold
rolled steel) is ten times that of iron ore. The United States is a
significant importer of semi-finished and finished steel products, with an
apparent consumption nearly equal to that of Japan, im tonnage terms; this
compares with an estimated weight for iron ore consumption in the United
States that is about one fifth that in Japan.

VI. CONCLUSION

This psper hss illustrated the tradeoffs policy makers would face when
choosing the width of a band, or when converging to an extremely narrow band
in order to shift to a unique currency. These tradeoffs concern the degree of
exchange- rate, interest-rate and fundamentals variability. They depend on the

assumed process (constant drift or mean reversion) for the disturbances which
affect money demand and/or supply.
They also depend on the type of coordination which would take place in case

of foreign exchange crisis. In this last respect, we have been careful to make
Assumption 2 so as to avoid altogether the problem of speculative attacks and
needed reserves. We have assumed that central banks credibly and
unconditionally intervene so as prevent speculative attacks. Indefinite
intervention is possible if the central bank of the currently strong currency
supports the other currency by printing money.

We have generalized the result of Svensson (1989) that the variability of
the exchange rate is translated into variability in the interest rate

differential.
We have also found that the degree of fundamentals variability which would
be tolerated by the market when a target zone is extremely narrow is very
large (a difference of two orders cf magnitude) in the case of a constant

drift disturbance and in the case of mean reversion with a band exactly
centered on the reversion point. The result is lost if the band is not
precisely centered there.

This means solving the system (14)-(l5) for different values of S and S

the 450 diagonal line which contains the fixed exchange points, and the free
float. The thick line is the locus of tangencies implied by the smooth

pasting conditions. Points above S are pairs (X,); points below S are
pairs (X, s.).

Figure 2: Extreme values of interest rate differential

The figure is constructed by changing the width of the exchange rate band

symmetrically around S —

4.5.

Points above o have abscissae equal to i and

ordinates equal to the interest rate differential (assumed equal to the
conditionally expected exchange rate change) reached when X — X. Points below

have abscissae equal to X and ordinates equal to the interest rate
differential (assumed equal to the conditionally expected exchange rate

change) reached when X —

Figure 3: Exchange rate and interest rate differential

When the band is wide as in the case of this figure ( — 1.999,

7.001),

the exchange-rate curve follows the free-float line and the interest-rate
curve is flat over most of the range of allowed variations. Numerical values

of parameters are: a — 0.25, p —

0.5

and y —

The figure is similar to Figure 5. While the reversion point A0 is still equal
to 4.8, the center of the exchange rate band is now at o

line and the 450 line would intersect at 7.8. The thin curve is an example of
an exchange rate curve. The thick line is the locus of tangencies implied by
