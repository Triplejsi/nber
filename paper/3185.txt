TRANSITIONAL DYNAMICS AND ECONOMIC CROWTH IN THE NEOCLASSICAL MODEL

understanding of the quahtatzve nature of the transitional dynamics of
the fleociasslcal model—the process of convergence from an initial capital
stock to a steady state growth path—is a key part of the shared hnowledge of
most economists.
It forms the basis, for exale, of the widespread interest
in hypotheses about convergence of levels of national economic activity.

Two key quantitative experiments by R. Sato [1963] and Atkinson [1969]

demonstrated that the neoclassical model's transitional dynamics may exhibit

very slow adjustment toward the steady state path and hence be responsible
for a significant fraction of the observed expansion in per capita output.
Working with the Cobb—Douglas production function and a fixed savings
rate,

Sato [1963] showed that there could plausibly be a very long adjustment

period in response to a fiscal policy induced shift in the savings rate.
Using parameters drawn from U.S. time series, Sato concluded that "for a 10

Figure 2 provides our version of Sato's [1963] experiment.

Rather than

is such that output is 50 percent below the steady path in the initial
period.

model but we are skeptical about relying on it in a world with potential

The net

was to (i) stress the

difficulty of raising the growth rate of final output by raising the rate of
physical capital accumulation, since a one percentage point change in the

rate of capital translates to only a (1—ck) percentage change in the
gro"th rate of output; and (ii) to generally emphasize the importance of the
"residual factor" in explaining growth (for example, Solow [1957] estimated
that only one eighth of US. economic growth over 1909 through 1949 was due
growth

to physical capital accumulation). Since the transitional dynamics of the
neoclassical

del revolve around the

accumulation

of physical capital, these

findings might suggest a minor role for this factor in the growth process.
But the growth accounting investigations that followed Solos

proceeded to make this line of argument more tenuous.

[1957]

These investigations

generally assign a much more important role to capital accumulation (a survey
of these results can be found in Maddison [1987])

.

In

a recent and

comprehensive volume, Jorgenson, Gollop and Fraumeni [1987] conclude that
"growth in capital input is the most important source of growth in value
added, growth in labor input is the next most important source, and

productivity growth is the least important."

In particular, these authors

For this reason, we believe that one cannot understand the properties of
the basic neoclassical model without undertaking a detailed quantitative
evaluation of its properties when its parameters are restricted by empirical
evidence.

This parameterizationmakes clear that to generate protracted

transitional dynamics that are consistent with moderate values for the real

so that the production function comes close to being constant returns in the

courterfactual, if we maintain that capital earns anything close to a

process of adjustment would be instantaneous.

Again, one might think that

introducing adjustment costs would eliminate this unrealistic irplication by

a wedge between the marginal product of capital and the real rate of

II

experiences of developed countries appear to offer a similarly decisive field
for evaluating aspects of the neoclassical model (see also Christiano
[1389])

Figures iO and 11 are drawn from Robert Berr6s Macroeconomics, which
contains the first systematic investigation of the predictions of the
neoclassical madel for the post World War II experience.

As Barro notes,

there is a clear association between initial levels of output (in 1950) and
the wartime positions of countries.

That is, it is plausible that the

winners (the U.S., the U.K.) lost less capital than occupied countries

or the losers (Japan, Germany and Italy) . It
is also plausible that the losers of the war suffered the most severe decline
in initial capital.
Broadly, these predictions are borne out for the levels of output per

and France)

1950 as depicted in Figure 10.

Further,

Figure ii shows that the

countries with the lower imitial levels of output subsequently display the
