The sources of the wealth increase sre not well

Most explanations of takeover premiums fall into one of two

categories:

The alternative, or transfer, hypothesis attributes target firm

in the firm.

Other hypotheses

This study uses both stock market and contract wage data to determine the
extent to which target firm shareholder wealth increases are accounted for by
transfers from unions.

The changes in union wage growth associated with

takeovers and accompanying chief executive officer

(CEO) changes3 are

estimated and the implied union wealth changes associated with takeovers ate
calculated.

These wealth changes are then compared to the corresponding

wealth changes experienced by target firm shareholders in association with
takeovers.
For corpanies

which the Bureau of National Affairs reported at least one union contract
settlement between 1976 and 1987, the data indicate the following

Shleifer and Summers do not restrict their analysis to union concessions.
However,

if takovers occur in order to appropriate

rents, then the

The

variation in wage levels from year to year reflects both real factors, which
are evident in the decline in wage growth seen in Figure 2, and the sectoral

composition of new wage settlements, which varies substantially from year to
year.

The last seven columns of Table 4 show the sectoral variation over time

in terms of employees

Figures 3 and 4 present the same information at a finer degree of
sectoral disaggregation.

The main reason for presenting these figures is to

show that most sectors behave similarly over this time—period, but also that
airlines are evidently quite different from the other sectors.

Part of the

difference in wage levels can be explained by the occasional appearance of a

wages in the data set.

year with the predicted levels from contracts settled in previous years and

This rough check of the data indicates that

the predicted wage profiles end up close to observed values just prior to the
start of subsequent contracts.

Apart from the first predicted figure, which

is based on just 34 observations, the largest differences occur for contracts
signed before and expiring during or just after the receseion of the early
1980's.

This is not surprising as expected and realized inflation (and other

factors) differ over these years.

The primary goal in running the regressions presented here is to
determine

the extent to which wage growth is associated with takeovers and CEO

changes, other things equal.

Section V.
This section compares union wealth changes calculated from the results of
Section IV to target firm shareholder wealth changes associated with
takeovers.

Estimates of union wealth changes are made under assumptions

designed to show the largest possible concessions or gains given the results
of rho previous section.

Target firm shareholder wealth premiums are

estimated using a simple market model, and the magnitudes of the premiums are
well within the normal rsnge.

This procedure gives the transfer hypothesis

its best chance to explain takeover premiums.

It also allows some perspective

on the economic significance of the findings in the previous section.
Employee wealth changes associatedwith takeovers are calculated as

A

as the mean real wage growth in the sample is just 0.17% per

reduction by 0.6% per year implies real wages declining

asymptotically to zero.

A more realistic assumption is that wage levels are

lowered at first (relative to what they would have been in the absence of the
takeover)

but that the growth rate reverts to the industry— or economy—wide

rate over time.

The movement to a new wage path parallel to the old one

implies constant wealth concessions per year after some point.

The infinite horizon present value of such a yearly concession is the
measure used here for the wealth concession per employee.

It is calculated oa

Finally,

rather than multiply the wealth change per union member figure

by the number of employees covered by each contract, total union employment
figures for each firm are estimated by obtaining total employment figures for

each firm at the tiae of the takeover26 and multiplying them by the percent
unionized in the sector.27

These figures are generally larger than estimates

from the sample as contracts are missing.

The implicit assumption that fira

production worker employment does not change much following takeovers is
empirically supported by Lichtenberg and Siegel (1989) and Brown and Medoff
(1988).

Roll (1986) points out that both target and bidding firm wealth effects

must be accounted for in determining the extent of wealth creation through
takeovers.

If acquiring firms are larger than target firms, then even small

negative returns to bidding firm shareholders may imply zero or negative net
wealth creation.

Roll defends the possibility of such a result on the basis

of irrational behavior by managers:

the year prior to the settlement date; the log of the real wage at the end of the
of the previon'
previous contract, and the percent difference between the wage at the end
contract and the wage in the (2—digit SIC) industry in the month prior to the settlement
month.
All variables are entered both linearly and as squares. The F—statistic 6cr::::
