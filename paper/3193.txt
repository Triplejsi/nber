SIGNALING AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION

ABSTRACT

This paper develops a signaling model in which accounting information
improves real investment decisions.
Pure cash flow reporting is shown to lead
to underinvestment when managers have superior information but are acting in
shareholders' interests. Accounting by prespecified, "objective" rules
alleviates the underinvestment problem.

in order

to reduce cash outflow, report higher net cash flow, and

support current stock price.
Accounting conventions help by partly distinguishing current
from investment outflows. Thus expenditures for plant, equipment
and other tangible assets are labeled as investment outflows, and put

on the balance sheet; current income is supposed to equal revenue
less current outflows only.
These conventions are only rules of thumb.

If accounting were

perfect, it would classify outflows as "good news" or "bad news," not

by class of expenditure.

Thus many good news, positive-NPV outlays

never qualify for the balance sheet, for example when expanded
opportunities lead to outlays for R&D, training and testing, start-up

ventures or technologies,

etc.

Unfortunately,

for capital equipment -- may reflect problems with current

rather than expanded investment
opportunities. Outside investors do not know. Outside accountants do
not know either.1

This paper does not attempt

present a general theory or
survey of the "meaning of accounting." It presents a simple formal
model in which (1) managers and investors are rationally concerned
with reported book earnings, (2) firms underinvest in order to report
lower costs and higher earnings, and (3) book earnings convey
2

to

information not contained in reported cash flow.

However, the paper

does not rule out other explanations for these three points.

For

example, managers' and investors' attention to reported earnings

may be triggered by links between managers' personal compensation

and earnings, or by attempts by managers to protect their firms from
adverse regulatory or political developments. Watts and Zimmerman
(1986) review research on these and related lines of argument.2

This paper ignores agency, regulatory and political issues.

It

assumes that managers' and stockholders' objectives are aligned.

Managers, acting in (a particular definition of) shareholders' interest,
bond themselves to accept "objective" accounting procedures to
relieve the underinvestment caused by signaling.

So far

I

have

found no prior research that anticipates this approach or result.3

This paper now turns to assumptions and notation, followed by

a more careful discussion of the boundary between good-news and

signaling equilibrium, and Section 6 shows how noisy but objective
accountants can reduce underinvestment. Section 7 contains brief
concluding comments.

Assumptions and Notation

3

The three main ingredients of the signaling models I have in
mind are: (1) the inability of investors (or outside accountants or
objective accounting rules)

to

distinguish good-news from bad-news
outflows, (2) an objective function which responds to current stock
price as well as intrinsic value, and (3) the resulting signaling-by-

underinvestment problem and the potential use of accounting

to

alleviate it.

In the current period the firm reports:
Cashflow=R-X = R-C-I
where

R=
C=
I

X

=

cash

cash
cash

(1)

revenue

outflows for current operations
outflows for investment

C + I = total cash outflows

Although revenue and total cash outflows are separately
observable by outside investors, current and investment outflows
are not. Managers, on the other hand, know C as well as R.
They

accept R and C, but control I.
Managers' investment decision I reflects the investment opportunity
schedule G(I), with dG/dI
G1> 0 at I = 0 and d2G/d12 G11 < 0.
Absent asymmetric information, the firm would invest to the point
where G1 = 0. Since financing decisions will play no role, we can
implicitly assume that investment is financed by cutting back cash
dividends or, if necessary, by issuing shares.
4

The assumed objective function responds to current stock price P
well as intrinsic value V:
maxW = aP+(1-a)V,
where

as

(2)

a is a fixed weight between 0 and 1.

This objective could be justified in several ways. For example,
shareholders might vote for it ex ante if each saw a probability a of

selling in the upcoming period, and also believed that intrinsic value
is an unbiased predictor of the following period's price (E(Pl) = V0).
Whatever the justification, it's essential for signaling story that the

objective function put partial weight on the current price P.4
Equilibrium requires that managers maximize this objective

with respect to I, given current stock price P:
max W = W(I R,C,P(I))
I

(3a)

Also, P must be an unbiased estimate of V given the limited
information available to investors.

P = E(VfR,X)

(3b)

Intrinsic firm value V depends on net current cash flow, R - C,
and on G(I). Investors and managers agree on the form of the
5

V(R-C,G(I)).

Also, V is defined before any payout of
current cash flow and before new shares, if any, are issued to finance
investment.

We can now define current outflows to include the hands-off

practice.

Larger-than-expected cash outflows are normally bad news in
categories (1) and (2A) and good news in categories (2B) and (3). For
example, suppose the firm is halfway through construction of a new
manufacturing plant. If difficulties are encountered, and cash is
flowing out unexpectedly fast, the bad news is reflected in (2A). On
the other hand, it's usually good news if construction is on target but

the firm decides to invest more to bring the plant on line faster.
cash outflow would fall in (2B).

This

The outside investor who observes the additional cash outflow
usually does not know what it means. Whether it's good or bad news
depends on the manager's motive for spending the money.

Of course

managers who worry about current stock price are always tempted
8

to provide the upbeat interpretation of their actions, so a good-news
press release does not resolve the matter.5
I

believe that separation of good-news and bad-news cash

outflows is, at least for mature firms, the single most difficult task

for outside investors and security analysts.

Most unexpected cash

outflows have two competing interpretations.

Does an increase in R
& D outlays reflect new positive-NPV opportunities or cost overruns
on existing projects? Do unexpected hiring and training costs mean
increases in projected future demand or simply that existing workers
aren't as productive as management had thought? Is purchase of a
new machine motivated by the opportunity to make a new product

cope with current
demand for existing products? It's hard for an outsider to know.
or by the discovery that old machines can't

4.

The Incentive to Underinvest

The assumptions given so far are still too broad to support a
specific signaling model.

We can nevertheless explore the conditions

necessary for the incentive to underinvest that will drive the model's
behavior.

Suppose investors believe that the firm is investing optimally.
Would its managers be willing to confirm those expectations, given
an objective that weights current price P in addition to intrinsic
value V?

9

It depends on the relative importance (and uncertainty) of

current outflows versus investment opportunities.

If investment

opportunities are unimportant, and investors are concerned mostly
with news

about current operations, firms will be tempted to

underinvest in order to pretend to have low current outflows and

high profits.

If uncertainty about investment opportunities

is large

enough, however, firms may be tempted to overinvest in order
pretend that growth opportunities are expanded.

to

The temptation to underinvest should dominate for established
firms. The following analysis illustrates why. Assume the firm can
only report revenue R and cash outflow X
I + C. It provisionally
decides to invest the optimal amount 1*, consistent with investors'
expectations. Now it considers changing I and X. Since V1 = 0 at

1*, the change in the objective function is

WI =

Managers will reduce I from 1* if

Investors, who in this instance don't know they are about to be
fooled, try to price at intrinsic value. Before X is announced,

Take the right-hand side terms in (7) one by one: an increase
in X is (1) bad news8 because it raises the upper bound on the
capitalized value of possible costs, relative to the "average" M; (2)
good news9 because it raises the upper limit on investment and NPV,

11

relative to the "average" H, and (3) bad news if, on average, an extra
dollar of operating cost reduces value by more than an extra dollar of
investment opportunities increases it.

Thus there are cases in which the firm is tempted to increase X,
Suppose that there is little uncertainty about
operating costs (M(X) - E(M) small), great uncertainty about
investment opportunities (H(X) - E(H) large), and that this period's

But if the ranges of possible C's and I*'s are roughly the same,'0

underinvestment should win out, because the "M-terms" are likely

to

be much larger than the "H-terms".

All this falls out in a very simple way if the current outflow C
is uniformly distributed over the range zero to X. In that case f(O) =

that is MC = M, a constant. Equation (7) becomes

This

guarantees

an

underinvestment incentive

by

assuming the investment opportunity function G(I) is known to

investors. The model yields a fully-revealing signaling equilibrium
formally similar to Miller and Rock's (1985), though with a different
economic interpretation. In the end investors are not fooled by

is

The investment function G(I) has a maximum G(I*) at 1* > 0. Also
G(0) = 0. We take MC = M, a positive constant. Only cash flow is

reported to investors.
In the fully-revealing equilibrium, outside investors infer the

true value of C and I by observing X. From their point of view, C is a
function C(X), 1(X) = X

-

C(X), and P(X) equals the true value V:

P(X) = V(C(X),X) = V(C,X)

Gains From Nondiscretionary Accounting

The only possible role for accountants in the signaling model
just presented would be to verify that cash revenues and outflows
were honestly reported. They would not be required to interpret
cash flows.

Real accountants do interpret, by putting some cash outflows
on the balance sheet, leaving the residual as a "cost" of current
operations. I regard this as a crude separation of good-news from
bad-news outflows.

An accountant (or accounting rule) that could distinguish the
true current outflow C embedded in X would eliminate signaling-byunderinvestment. (Once investors know C, Cx = 0, and setting W =
implies optimal investment.)

G1 = 0

But an accountant cannot truly distinguish C from I because he

or she must be an an outsider and thus can never be sure of insiders
motives for spending money. Indeed an accountant who attempted a
subjective assessment of C and I would be naturally suspected of
shading

towards

managers'

and

selling

stockholders'

interests.

Instead, accountants (or accounting rules) classify expenditures not

by their motivation, but by use, e.g. for wages, equipment, R&D, etc.
This will convey valuable information, however, if expenditures that

go on the balance sheet are more likely to be motivated by good
news than expenditures that are left as current costs.

Managers are concerned with current stock price as well as intrinsic

1)

Inside accountants, e.g. the controller, are treated as management.

Several recent papers present models which could explain
accounting as a rational response to agency problems, in which a
compensation rule or contract must be worked out in a situation
where the manager's effort or performance cannot be observed
Examples are the papers by Lambert (1984) and by
directly.
2)

Demski, Patell and Wolfson (1984).

Titman and Trueman (1986) is a partial exception. They assume
that firms want to signal low earnings volatility. Some firms can do
this by damping fluctuations in reported income, but others cannot.
Investors cannot distinguish the two groups. The result is a pooling
equilibrium in which some high-volatility firms use income
smoothing to imitate lower-volatility firms.

3)

Miller and Rock (1985) discuss the pros and cons of this objective
function. One obvious con is that putting no weight on current stock
price (a = 0) leaves all shareholders better off ex ante. However, it's
difficult to insulate managers from pressure from shareholders who
have decided to sell right away.
Of course managers could pay attention to current stock price for
other seasons, e.g. because of takeover threats.
