that

reductions in administrative overhead are an important source of
these productivity improvements; and that the productivity gains
associated with management buyouts are much

larger than those

associated with "gardenvariety" changes in ownership.
The purpose of this paper is to extend this line of research
on

the consequences of control changes for economic performance by

analyzing the effects of mergers on prices, costs, productivity,
and capacity utilization in the U.S. air transportation industry
during the period 1970-1984.

The rate of merger and takeover

activity in this industry increased sharply in about 1979: there
was apparently only one significant merger involving U.S. airlines
during

the

years

1970-78,

but four mergers

during

1979-81.

Although this increase may partly reflect an acceleration in merger
and takeover activity throughout

the economy at around this time,

largely attributable to the deregulation of the

industry that occurred in the late 1970s.

In any case, these and

subsequent developments have stimulated an intense debate about the
effects and desirability of airline mergers.

In a recent paper, Morrison and Winston (1989)

evaluated the

effect of airline mergers (excluding the Texas Air acquisitions)

Morrison and Winston observe that their failure to account
for changes in choice probabilities and for mode or destination

II. DATA

The database for this investigation was developed by Caves,
Tretheway, and Windle

Christensen,

and has been analyzed and

described by them in a number of earlier papers (1981, 1984, 1987)
It

includes

annual observations on 25 U.S. trunk and local service

airlines for 1970—84, and on 10 (start—up) airlines for 1982—84.

Because, as Morrison and Winston

have shown, travelers value attributes such as travel and

transfer time and schedule delay, this producer output index is

very imperfect index of true input in travelers' utility functions.
However errors in measuring the "quality" of output pose a problem

for

determining the effects of mergers only to the extent that

changes in these errors are correlated with mergers.

Morrison and

Winston found that frequent flier mileage was the only component
of output quality significantly affected by merger.

But apparently

In addition to these variables, the database includes three

effect of mergers on output price is indeterminate, a nriori, and
must be determined empirically.

There are two distinct ways—-one external, the other internal,
to the firms involved--in which mergers could affect, and might be
expected to redu e, unit costs. The first is by influencing the
prices paid by the producer for inputs. There may be economies of

scale in the supply of some of the firm's inputs. Also, the firm's
'nonopsony power (as well as its monopoly power) may be increased
by merger, thus lowering the prices of factors of prodt.ction.
