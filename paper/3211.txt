THE DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOW BIRTHWEIGHT AND INDUCED ABORTION IN NEW
YORK CITY: AN AGGREGATE TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS

ABSTRACT
We use a vector autorgression to examine the dynamic relationship between
the race-specific percentage of pregnancies terminated by induced abortion and
the race-specific percentage of low-birthweight births in New York City.

With

monthly data beginning in 1972, we find that induced abortion explains low
birthweight for blacks, but not for whites. There is no evidence of feedback
from low birthweight to induced abortion. Simulations based on the model
reveal that an unanticipated decrease in the percentage of pregnancies
terminated by induced abortion results in an increase in the rate of lowbirthweight births among blacks.

The findings suggest that restrictions on

legalized abortion in New York City would worsen birth outcomes among blacks.
