USING PRODUCTION BASED ASSET PRICING TO EXPLAIN THE BEHAVIOR
OF STOCK RETURNS OVER THE BUSINESS CYCLE

ABSTRACT

The investment return is defined as the real return that results from
marginally increasing investment at date r, and then reaping the extra output
and decreasing investment at date t+1 to leave the production plan for other
dates unchanged.

This paper constructs inveatment returns from investment

data and a production function, and compares investment returns to stock
returns, in order to explain forecasts of stock returns by business cycle
related variables, and to explain forecasts of future economic activity by
stock returns.

Recent empirical work in finance contains a great deal of evidence that
asset returns are linked to business cycles. The term premium, the corporate

or junk bond premium, lagged returns, dividend price ratios, and investment

all forecast stock returns and real variables, and stock returns forecast
future investment and aMP growth.

Risk premia vary over time in other

markets as well: the holding period ten premium in the bond market and the

forward premium in the foreign exchange market vary over time and appear
correlated with business cyclesJ
This paper applies a production based asset pricing model as described
in Cochrsne (1988) to explain these links between stock returns and business

cycle variables.

The central concept in this approach is the investment

return. The investment return is the marginal return to physical investment.
If investment is marginally Increased at time t, output will rise at t+l, and

investment tan be decreased at t÷l, leaving the capital stock unchanged at
t+2 and beyond. The investment return is the extra output and disinvestment
at

t+l

divided by the marginal investment at t. Firms will adjust investment

to remove arbitrage opportunities between investment returns and stock

returns, so changes in stock returns should be mirrored in investment
returns.

In this paper, investment returns are constructed from investment data
and an assumed production function end compared to real returns on the GRSP

value weighted NYSE portfolio.

The comparison investigates I) whether

investment returns and value weighted returns are highly correlated, 2)

whether forecasts of value weighted returns are equal to forecasts of

investment returns, 3) whether forecasts of future GNP growth and investment

to capital ratios based on value weighted returns are the same as
corresponding forecasts based on investment returns, and 4) whether the
projection of value weighted returns and investment returns on investment to
capital ratios are the same.

The investment return calculated with an adjustment cost technology in

this paper is approximately a monotone function of investment growth: when
investment at t is high, investment returns from t to t+l are low, because
marginal investment runa into a stiff adjustment cost; when investment at t+l
is high, investment returns from t to t+l are high, because disinvestment at
t+l benefits from the high adjustment cost.

Hence, relations between asset

returns and investment growth in the data drive the relations between asset
returns and investment returns that are the empirical results of this paper,

and these results are not sensitive to the particular form of the
adjustment cost technology,

This approach can be understood as a direct measurement of the real
investment opportunity set. The investment returns on all active production

processes constitute the investment opportunity set, so equilibrium asset
returns should mirror changes in this opportunity set.

This approach can also be viewed as a production hased analog to the
conaumption based asset pricing model, formed from a return version of the q

theory of investment (for example, Abel and Blanchard (1986)).

The first

order conditions of present value maximizing firms imply that firms should

adjust their investment plans until no arbitrage opportunities are left
between investment returns and asset returns.

Then, as one can reverse

consumers' first order conditions for optimal consumption decisions given
asset returns, to express equilibrium asset returns am m function of a given
process for consumption, so one can reverse producers' first order conditions

for optimal investment decisions given asset returns, to express equilibrium

asset returns as a function of a given process for investment.

This

interpretation creates the consumption based asset pricing model from
consumers' first order conditions, or a "production based asset pricing
model" from producers' first order conditions,

2

The q theory of investment is not known for its good empirical fit.
However, the experience of the consumption based asset pricing literature
suggests that, as Euler equations describing returns are more empirically

successful than present value relations describing prices, so the return

version of the q theory may be more empirically successful than the
conventional present value version.

One reason is that most empirical

implementations of present value models (present value of dividends or
present value of marginal benefits of investment) exclude time varying risk

premia for tractahility, yet the data display convincing evidence of time

varying rick premia (see the first footnote, and Cochrane (1989a) for
discussion of this point). Also, returns emphasize high frequency aspects of

the data that the models may be better able to capture in the presence of
slow moving changes in technology or preferences.

The goal of this production based approsch is to provide an slternate

partial equilibrium framework that is analogous to the consumption based

asset pricing model but sidesteps its problems, and ties asset returns
directly to cyclicslly important variables such as investment. Just as
consumer's first order conditions describe a relscion thst should hold

between asset returns and consumption no matter what producers do, so
producer first order conditions describe a relation that should hold between

asset returns and production variables like investment no matter what
consumers do.

However, it is only a partial equilibrium model, and is thus distinct

from empirically oriented general equilibrium asset pricing models with
nontrivial production sectors.2 To the extent that the model in this paper
is successful, it can take statements like "expected asset returns are low

becsuse expected investment growth (more accurately, investment return) is

low," as a successful consumption based model (Ferson and Constsntinedes

(1980) (1982), Bossearts snd Green (1989), Donaldson and Mehra (1984) snd
Sundsressn (1984).
Partial equilibrium consumption based models are often

called "general equilibrium" following Lucss (1978). In these models,
consumption is given as an endowment. Since actual economies have storsge
snd production, these models in fact only exploit the partial equilibrium
relation between consumption snd asset returns in empirical applicstions.

I, Producer's first order conditions and Investment returns

This section shows formally that producers' first order cond.itions imply

thst there should be no srbicrsge between asset returns and investment
returns.

It introduces a parametric form for production technology, and

shows that with that technology, the investment return is equal to the return

on the fIrm's own stock.

markets sre complete enough that any investment csn be financed externally,
so that managers need not bear any risk. The setup is quite similar to that
in Abel and Blsnchard (1986), Ross (1978) end roughly similar statements can

be found in a lsrge number of papers and textbooks, for example Fams and
Miller (1972). Braun (1989) makes the connection to q theory explicit.

Comparing the producer's first order conditions (10) or (12) end the
orthogonality relation between aeset returns and contingent claims prices (2)

or (4), the producer's first order conditions direcc the firm to adjust
investment so that the investment returns lie in the space of asset returns
defined by (2). This means that the firm should operate the technology up to
the point where it can no longer make sure profits by arbitrage between asset

market returns and its investment return.

Three equivalent statements are

that the firm should adjust investment until 1) the benchmark that prices
asaet returns also correctly pricea investment returns; 2) investment returns

match asset returns of similar risk characteristics; and 3) the firm can no
longer short a portfolio of assets that has returns less than or equal to the

investment return in each state of nature, create the investment return, and

make a profit in at least some states. When there are several technologies,

producer's first order conditions specify (10) or (12) for each investment
return separately.

To derive (10) or (12), consider a marginal change in investment at time

The notation R(t-at÷l) is used to distinguish a quarterly return from an
annual return, denoted R(t4t+4).

Note that the investment return is a

decreasing function of time t investment and an increasing function of time
t-4-l investment as explained in the introduction. The investment return has

roughly the same sensitivity to investment at t and at ts-l, though with
opposite sign, so the investment return is roughly proportional to investment
growth.

(More precisely, a Taylor expansion of the investment return with

respect to investment at time t and t+l has approximately the same
coefficients with opposite signs.)

With this technology, the investment return is also the return to owning

a unit of capital.

The model so far only allows us to compare investment

returns and some portfolio of asset returns, picked to mimic the pattern of

the investment return across states of nature. With this result, we can
compare investment returns directly to the returns on the firm's own stock.

combination of technologies, the (marginal) investment return will be the
same as the return on a ownership share of the firm.

investment returns

To examine the cyclical behavior of stock returns in the simplest
version of the above model, the CRSP value weighted portfolio is modeled as a

claim to the capital stock corresponding to gross fixed private domestic
investment.3 The real value weighted return and the investment return should
be the same:

RW(t4t+1) R'(It/ki It÷l/kt+lk mp÷1).
In particular

(18)

the empirical work focuses on three issues: 1) whether

forecasts of value weighted returns are the same as forecasts of investment

returns 2) whether value weighted returns have the same relation to
contemporaneous investment to cspitsl ratios (I/ki I/k+1) as investment
returns and 3) whether forecasts of future investment and GNP from value

weighted returns are the ssme as corresponding forecssts from investment
returns.

However, we can expect an error term in implementing (18). First, we do

not have direct dats on the production function shock mp÷1 so a constant
value is used instead.4 Second, the value weighted return may be in fact a

3The bend portion of claims to firms in the value weighted NYSE are ignored.
Since bond returns vary a great deal less than expectef stock returns, snd
since the standard deviation of investment returns is an essentially free
parsmeter, it is hoped that not much error is introduced.

Unfortunately, there is no reason to believe that any of these error
term components are serially uncorrelated, uncorrelated with investment to

capital ratios or investment returns, or uncorrelated with instruments
(return forecasting variables). In the regressions described above, there is

then a danger that a coefficient ascribed to the investment returns with no

productivity shock (the first term in (19)) is in fact due to spurious
correlation with the error term. Lacking convincing statistical assumptions,

this possibility is acknowledged, but no correction is made for it. The
consumption based model suffers from the same problem: unobserved preference

shocks, components of consumption that enter nonseparably in the utility
function (for example, the service flow from durables), and measurement error

all contribute to the error term, but there is no reason to expect the error

from these sources to obey the orthogonality restrictions that the forecast
error obeys.

A. Construction of investment returns

The investment data are real gross private domestic investment.

For

each given choice of parameters, a capitaistock series is constructed by

accumulating past investment, using the capital accumulation rule (14)
Then, investment to capital ratios are formed, and quarterly returns (from

t-l to t) are calculated from investment to capital ratios at t-1 and t
according to (15) .

Overlapping quarterly observations of annual investment

returns from t-4 to t are constructed by accumulating quarterly returns.

Investment is a quarterly aggregate, but value weighted returns are

important to changes in returns and expected returns than dividend changes,

leaving out changes in marginal products may have a small effect on the
results,

and

investment returns (R1)

Three parameters govern the relation between investment returns and the
investment to capital ratio: the adjustment coat parameter a, depreciation S

and the productivity of capital mp. When the adjustment cost parameter a is
zero, the annual investment return collapeea to R'(t-4 4 t) —

and the quarterly return to R1(t-l 4 t) — (l+6)(l-i-mp),

(l6)(l-t-mp)4,

so these parameters'

main effect is to control the mean return The adjustment cost parameter a

controls the sensitivity of investment returns to investment to capital
ratios, and thus the variance of investment returns.

However, the parameters have alaoat no effect on the relative
sensitivity of investment returns to investment to capital ratios at
different dates, and thus the correlation of investment returna with other
variables,

Some numerical examples of this insensitivity are presented

below.

Given that the parameters (a, 6, mp) control the mean and standard

12

deviation of investment returns, but have little impact on its timing or
correlation with other variables, the parameters of the investment return are

chosen as follows: I) depreciation 6 is chosen arbitrarily, and then 2) the

marginal product mp and the adjustment cost a are chosen together to make

meen investment return equal the mean real value weighted return and to
equate the standard deviation of the fitted values of regressions of real

value weighted and investment returns on eight leads and lags of the
investment to capital ratio, The resulting parameters are given in the note
to table I.

The reason for this choice of standard deviation is that the regression

of value weighted returns on investment to capital ratios leaves a much
larger residual than the projection of investment returns on investment to
capital ratios.

This residual may be attributed to other factors, or to

marginal productivity shocks (see equation (19)).

Thus, this choice of

standard deviation is designed to produce a series of about the same standard

deviation as the investment return component of value weighted returns, the
first term of equation (19) .

Since most of the results are driven by the

correlsrion of investment and value weighted returns, or their regressions on
various variables, this scaling is not crucial to the results.

A puzzle of the q theory is that adjustment coat estimates seem
implausibly high. They imply that very large fractions of GNP (often greater
than 1) are lost to adjustment costs.

This is analogous to the consumption

based puzzle that large coefficients of risk aversion seem to be required.
With the technology (13)-(14), the fraction of investment lost to adjustment
costs is (aJZ)(I/lc)2. a is around 13 (see note to Table I), I/k is about the

same as depreciation, .1, so the fraction of investment lost to sdjustment
costs is about 7%.

The fraction of output lost is I/y x 7%, or around 1%.

Thus the puzzle of implausibly high adjustment costs is not present in these
parameters.

Fig.

investment returns are nearly identical, though the parameters vary widely in

economic terms. In particular, the timing of the peaks and troughs is almost
completely unaffected by the large changes in parameters.
Insert fig. 4 about here

In fig. 4, the adjustment cost parameter a is varied, while keeping the

mean investment return equal to the mean value weighted return with the
marginal product mp.

(The parametara are given in the note to table I.) As

claimed above, fig. 4 ahows that e controls the standard deviation of
investment returns, with essentially no effect on their cyclical timing and
thus their correlation with other variables.

Thus the correlation between

investment returns and real value weighted returns evident in fig. 2 is
essentially independent of parameter choices, as claimed above.

B. Correlation between investment and value weighted returns.

Table I presents some regressions and correlations designed to
quantitatively assess the correlation between investment returns and real
value weighted returns apparent in fig. 2.
Insert table I sbout here

The message of table I is that the correlation visible to the eye in
fig. 2 is statistically significant at conventional levels. The correlation

coefficient between value weighted and investment returns ranges from .241
for quarterly returns to .385 for annual returns and is as high as .449 for
first quarter annual returns.

Table I also includes regressions and correlations of value weighted

14

returns with investment growth and CNP growth.

Both have about the same

correlation with value weighted returns as the investment return, and graph

of investment and CNP Browth against value weighted returns look very much
like fig. 2. Thua the correlation of fig. 2 is not a sensitive result of the

nonlinear function relating investment returns to investment data. The point
of the paper is to explain this correlation, rather than to find a particular

nonlinear transformation of investment that produces a suddenly high
correlation with stock returns.

C. Forecasts of investment returns and value weighted returns

Table II compares forecasts of real value weighted returns and forecasts

of investment returns, at both annual and quarterly horizons.

The
forecasting variables are chosen from the literature that documents the

forecastability of stock returns (see footnote I).

These are the term

premium, the corporate premium, the lagged real value weighted return, and
the dividend price ratio. (See the data appendix for sources.)
Insert table II about here

For each forecasting variable a preliminary regreasion was run to
determine if the variable aggregated over the previous year or previous

quarter provided a better forecast of value weighted returns.

This

prelieinary regression is presented in part 1 of table II, and suggests the
use of an annual horizon for the term premium and dividend price ratio and a

quarterly horizon for lagged returns and the corporate premium,5

In

addition, the investment to capital ratio in the previous quarter is used as
a forecasting variable.

Parts 2 and 3 of table II present single regressions of quarterly and

annual returns on the forecasting variables.

The coefficients of value
weighted returns on each of the forecasting variables are significant at

a danger of overfitting, so the

probability values of the value weighted return forecasts are optimistic.

However, even if one set of variables was used without looking at the
results, it could not be made independent of the literature-wide fishing
expedition that has produced these forecasting variables, so this procedure
was followed to make sure the better forecasting variable was not overlooked.

equal, the difference between the value weighted return and the investrie

return is regressed on the forecasting variables, in the column marked
"VP-mv," As the table shows, we cannot reject that the coefficients are
equal for all the forecasting variables except the dividend price ratio.

To assess the importance of the particular adjustment cost technology

used to form investment returns, value weighted returns were regressed on
contemporaneous and lagged investment to capital rstios, a fitted return was

calculsted from this regression, and used in place of the investment return
in the column aarked "VP -

Fit."

Interestingly, the fitted return performs

worse than the investment return for all variables other than the dividend

price ratio, for which it is nearly identical.

Thus, though the fitted

return (by construction) improves on the investment return for the objective
of a high correlation between er-post returns and for matching the projection

of returns on investment to capital ratios, it then does worse in matching
er-ante returns. This observation provides some evidence that the investment
return calculated through the adjustment cost technology is more than a proxy
for the projection of value weighted returns on investment to capital ratios.

Parts 4 and 5 of table II

returns, using all the forecasting variables together. They also report the

coefficients of these regressions are omitted to save spate, since they were
similar to those reported for the multiple regression including the dividend
price ratio, except that the investment to capital ratio enters more strongly
when the dividend price ratio is absent.)

All together, the forecasting variables are jointly significant

6Poterba snd Summers (1988) and Cochrane and Sbordone (1988) note that the
variance ratio of stock returns is one at annual horizons but lower for both
shorter and longer horizons, which is the same observation.

predictors of value weighted returns: the

test for the joint significance

has a probability vslue of 0.03% for quarterly value weighted returns and
0.01% for annual value weighted returns, with R2s of .12 an .22.

Only the

dividend price ratio is an individually significant predictor of value
weighted returns. However, the other variables are jointly significant, both
in multiple regressions that include the dividend price ratio end those that
exclude it.

When the difference between value weighted and investment returns is
regressed on all the forecasting variables, the individual variables except

the dividend price ratio are even less significant.

The exception is the

investment to capital ratio with annual returns, which enters with a 3.94%
probability value.

More importantly, the coefficients on all variables

except the dividend price ratio are now jointly insignificant, so we cannot

reject that the investment return and value weighted return forecasts based
on all variables except the dividend price ratio are the same.

As with the

aingle regressions, the fitted return formed by projecting value weighted
returns on investment to capital ratios performs worse than the investment

returns in explaining forecasts of the value weighted return in multiple
regressions.

Parts 4 and 5 of table II also document the similarity of multiple
regression forecasts of value weighted returns and investment returns by the

correlation of and regressions between the two forecasts.

Without the

dividend price ratio, the correlation of the two forecasts is .875 quarterly
and .938 annual, and statistically significant. Fig. 5 plots these forecasts
of quarterly real value weighted and investment returns and demonstrate their

correlation to the eye. Interestingly, the correlations of return forecasts
are much higher than the correlations of the returns themselves.
Insert fig. 5 about here

However, the dividend price ratio significantly forecasts the difference

between value weighted and investment returns, and lowers the correlation
between the two forecasts. Fig. 6 presents forecasts of quarterly investment
and value weighted returns including the dividend price ratio.
Insert fig. 6 about here

17

The pattern of these results suggests that all variables except the
dividend price ratio have a common business cycle component that forecasts
value weighted and investment returns equally, but the dividend price tatio
contains another, longer term component that forecasts a long term component

in value weighted returns not found in investment returns7. The fact that
each of the variables significantly forecast value weighted returns in single

regressions and jointly in multiple regressions, but only the dividend price
ratio is individually significant in multiple regressions, suggests that the

variables except the dividend price ratio are all forecasting the same
component of returns but the dividend price ratio forecasts a different
component. The long run interpretation of the dividend price ratio forecasts

is suggested by the difference between fig. S and fig. 6. In both figures,
the cyclical movements in the value weighted return forecasts are matched by
cyclical movements in the investment return forecast, but in fig. 6, with the

dividend price ratio added, the value weighted return forecast waves slowly
around the inveatment return forecast, in response to long horizon changes in
the dividend price ratio.

D. Regressions of investment and value weighted returns on investment to

capital

ratios

Table III presents single and multiple regressions of value weighted

returns, investment returns, and the difference between value weighted
returns and investment returns on investment to capital ratios.

These

regressions address all three issues- -forecasts of returns based on
investment to capital ratios, the association of returns with subsequent
investment to capital ratios, and the projection of returns on contemporary
investment to capital ratios,

Insert table III about here
The first column of each part of table Ill (columns 1, 6, 11, 15 and 21)

and figa. 7 and B present the slope coefficients from single regressions of

value weighted returns and investment returns on investment to capital
ratios.

7Fama and French (1988b) suggested this interpretation of dividend price
ratio forecasts of returns.

18

insert fig.a 7 and 8 about here

As shown in fig. 7 and 8, the pattern of single regression coefficients

is similar, but the value weighted return coefficients are slightly shifted
in time. The size of the shift is about the same for annual as for quarterly
returns.

The shift is about two quarters for lagged investment to capital

racios, near t-8, declines to one quarter near t and vanishes for leada of

the investment to capital ratio, by t-t-3 or t+4,

However, the single

regressions of value weighted less investment returns on investment to
capital ratios (columns II and 13) show that the only evidence against
equality of value weighted and investment return coefficients comes at I/k(t)
and I/k(t+l) quarterly end l/k(t-2), I/kC,t-l) and I/k(t) for annual returns.

Thus, only the part of the shift of fig. 6 and 7 near I/k(t) is statistically
significant

Since investment to capital ratios are serially correlated, they should
forecast investment and hence value weighted returns. The single regressions

in table III show that they do: i/k(t-2) forecasts quarterly value weighted

teturns from t-l to t with a probability value of 2.12% (col, I), and
I/k(t-S) forecasts annual returns from t-4 to t with a probability value of

4.34% (column 5),8

Furthermore, we do not reject that the forecasts of

investment and value weighted returns from lagged investment to capital

ratios are the same in the single regressions of value weighted less
investment returns (columns 11, 13).

Also as a result of serial correlation in investment to capital ratios,
investment returns are associated with future investment to capital ratios in

single regressions, though they only depend on investment to capital ratios

at times between t-4 (annual) or t-l (quarterly) and t in a functional or
multiple regression sense, In fact, the highest predicted single regression

8The return series in these forecasting regressions is shifted forward in

time one month relative to the usual timing in return forecasting
regressions. Normally, the return from Jan 1 to March 31 would be regressed
on fourth quarter investment to capital ratio, whereas in these regressions.
the return from February 1 to April 30 is regressed on the fourth quarter I/k
ratio, as explained in fig. 1. Experiments revealed slightly higher forecast
power in the usual timing, but not enough difference to warrant an extra set
of tables. Also, equally weighted return forecasts are more significant with
either timing.

coefficients do not occur until several quarters past t. (See figs. 7 end 8).

Tsble III shows chat the single regressions of value weighted returns on
future investment to capital ratios are indeed highly significant (columns I,
15), and thst the equality of the investment return and value weighted return

coefficients on future investment to capital rstioa is not rejected (cclua
11, 13).

The first set of multiple regressions in each part of table III

is

designed to capture the shape of the relation between value weighted returns

and investment to capital ratios (columns 2, 3, 16, 17 and 18) and compare
that to the shape predicted by the model for investment returns (columns 7, 8

and 22, 23). Columns S and 23 present the partial derivatives of the
investment return function with respect to investment to capital ratios,

which are close to the multiple regression coefficients.

The multiple

regression of value weighted less investment returns on investment to capital

ratios (columns 12 and 14) tests the equality of the investment return and
value weighted return multiple regression coefficients

Value weighted returns are firat regressed on investment to capital at
t-l and t (quarterly, column (U) and t-4 and t (annual, column (16)), to try
to recover what should be the most important coefficients, These regressions
recover the right signs and approximately the right relative magnitudes, but

are slightly lower in absolute magnitude than the corresponding investment
return coefficients. This is a result of the fact that the parameters of the
investment return were chosen to match the standard deviation of projections

on eight leads and lags of investment to capital ratios, but investment
returns are mostly related to I/k(t) and I/k(t-l) (quarterly) or l/K(t-4)

(annual), while the projection of value weighted returns on I/k is more
spread out.

Annual value weighted returns are then regresaed on all the investment
to capital ratios of which they should be a function, from t-4 to t (column
17).

Here, we find that the t-4 to t-l investment to capital ratios enter

negatively as thay should, but not with the relative magnitudes predicted by
the model.

The model predicts a much larger coefficient for t-4 than for

t-3, t-2 and t-1 (see columns 22 and 23), but t-l has the largest coefficient
in the value weighted return regression.

20

The model predicts that only investment to capital ratios at t-4 through

t (annual) or e-l to t (quarterly) should enter in a multiple regression.

Thus columns 3 and 18 add two future and two past investment to capital
ratios.

statistics reject the hypothesis that all the multiple

regression coefficients are equal. However, most of this rejection is due to

the coefficients contemporaneous to returns, as seen in the joint
statistics for only the other coefficients.

Thus, the single and multiple regressions in part 3 of table ITT suggest

that the major difference between the regressions of value weighted and
investment returns on investment to capital ratios is the shape of the
relation between returns and contemporaneous investment to capital ratios
(I/k(t-4). .I/k(t) annual and I/k(t-l), I/k(t) quarterly), rather than in

differences of the projection of returns on investment to capital ratios
hefore or after the return period, which would reflect different forecasts of

investment and value weighted returns or different associations of value
weighted and investment returns with subsequent investment to capital ratios.

The set of multiple regressions marked "forecasts" in each part of table

III investigates forecasts of returns from several investment to capital
ratios taken together. The first forecasting multiple regressions (columns 4

and 19) show thmt all the forecastability comes from the investment to
capitsl ratio immediately prior to the return period: t-2 for quarterly
returns and t-5 for annual returns, in that investment to capital ratios for

prior periods are not individually or jointly significant given these.

21

Hence, forecasts of returns from earlier individual investment to capital

ratios are just due to the serial correlation of investment to capital
ratios.

The next forecasting multiple regressions (columns 5 and 20) telce th

argument one step further: they show that the t-2 (quarterly) and t-5
(annual) investment to capital ratios in turn get their forecast power from

their ability to forecast investment to capital ratios contemporary to
returns, c-l and t quarterly and t-4

t annual.

ratios -

Part

3 of table III confirms this view, in that investment to capital

ratios before t-l (quarterly) and t-4 (annual) do not forecast the difference

between value weighted returns and investment returns in single or multiple
regressions.

Table III was replicated with equally weighted returns end with
investment to GNP ratios in the place of investment to capital ratios.

The

pattern of results in both cases was so similar that the tables are omitted
to save space.

F. Forecasts of GNP growth from investment returns and value weighted returns
Insert table IV and figs. 9, 10 about here
Table IV presents forecasts of ONE growth from lagged returns. The first

and second parts of table TV present the slope coefficients of single
regressions of ONE growth on lagged value weighted and investment returns.
These coefficients are also displayed in fig.s 9 and 10. The pattern of the

coefficients is roughly the same, though the overall magnitude of the
coefficients of ONE growth on investment returns is larger. The figures also

suggest a shift of the single regression coefficients, as was the case of
single regression coefficients of returns on investment to capital ratios.

Value weighted returns from t-3 to t are individually significant for
quarterly ONE and value weighted returns from t-4 to t are individually
significant for annual ONE, confirming Fama's (1981) and Barro's (1989a)

22

(1989b) results.

The last column in the first two parts of table IV presents single
regression coefficients of CNP growth on value weighted less investment

returns, to test whether the single regression coefficients on the two
returns individually are the same. There is some evidence that they are not
at the 10% level, but only two out of twenty coefficients are significant at

the 5% level. The 10% rejections are concentrated around t-3 and t-2 where
the shift between the two coefficients is largest, rather than near t-l or t

where the magnitudes of the coefficients and the magnitude of their
difference are largest.

In particular, the large difference between the

coefficienta near t visible in figs.

9 and 10 is not atatistically

significant.

Parts 3 and 4 of table IV present multiple regressions of GNP growth on
lagged investment returns and value weighted returns. (Multiple regressions
using up to ei-ght lags were run, but the additional lags were insignificant.)

In both cases the nearest lags are the most significant predictors of CNP.
The regressions of CNP growth on investment return lees value weighted return
do not reject that the coefficients are individually and jointly equal.

ILLS. Concluding Remarks

The simple implementation of a production based asset pricing model in
this paper predicted that stock returns and investment returns should be the
sane.

This idea was used to explain the forecastability of real value

weighted stock returns, and the fact that stock returns forecast real
variables including investment and GNP.

Projections of returns on

contemporaneous investment to capital ratios were also included as a
diagnostic.

Forecasts of investment returns end value weighted returns appeared to

be the same for most of the forecasting variables.

In this sense the

shifting investment opportunities measured by the investment returns explain
the forecestsbility of stock returns.

23

Forecasts of future investment to capital ratios and GNP growth from
investment returns and value weighted returns also sppeared to be the same.

Investment returns are only functionally related to contemporaneous
inveataent to capital ratios, and their ability to forecast future investment

to capital ratios and GNF growth in single regressions is due only to aerial

correlation in investment to capital ratios and correlation of investment to

capital ratios with aubaequent ON? growth. Hence the equality of value
weighted and inveatment return foreoasta of future economic activity means

that the ability of stock returns to forecast future economic activity is
attributed only to their correlation with contemporaneous investment returns
and diaappeara in a multiple regression context.

Other successes include findings that ex-post investment returns and

value weighted returns are highly correlated and that the projection of
investment and value weighted returns on inveatment to capital ratios matchea
in many reapeots.

However, investment returns did not explain the component of value
weighted returns forerastable by dividend price ratios am dividend price
ratios seemed to forecast a long horizon component in value weighted returns

not present in inveatrsent returns. This component ?

value weighted returna

might reflect a long term movement in productivity, which is an unmeasured
component of investment returns in this paper's empirical implementation.

Also, the shape of the function relating value weighted returns to
investment to capital ratios was significantly different from that of the
investment returns.

The single regression coefficients exhibited a

statistically significant one quarter shift near time t, and the pattern of

multiple regression coefficients, though qualitatively the same, was
quantitatively different, and the difference was statistically significant.
Unoertainties in the timing of investment may account for some of the shift.

For example, if investment purchased this quarter does not give rise to
productive capital until next quarter, this could account for a one quarter
shift. The difference in the pattern of the projection of annual returns on
investment to capital ratios suggests a technologies in which the multiperiod

return depends more strongly on events in the middle of the return horizon
rather than just on the two ends.

24

There are several promising direc Lions in which this model can be
extended.

With a model for the benchmark return, the parameters of the

investment return can be estimated by generalized method of momenta, and
overidentifying restrictions tested;

alternate forms for technology may

improve the fit, including gestation lags and adjustment costs to changing

the level of investment; and variations in marginal products may be
estimated. Most importantly, the implications for cross sectional variation
in returns, lost here by aggregation to a single technology, may be explored
using components of investment or industry or firm investment data.

bill return. VW ret, is the real value weighted return, with conventional
timing (Ret. (t) is the return from the beginning of qusrter t to the end of
quarter t, as with corp). dip is the dividend price catio. Term and dip are
based on returns for the year ending in the indicated quarter (t-5 or

Return variables: The annual value weighted and investment return
The

variable labelled "Fit" is the fitted value of an OhS regression of

weighted return on contemporaneous and lagged investment to

capital ratio.

The regression coefficients used to form efiti! are given in table II

columns

2 and 17.

Annual return standard errors are adjusted using a Hansen (1982) (1987) correction, using 8 covariances, or twice the overlap.

All

Newey-West
correlation standard errors include this correction. Each regression uses as
much of the sample 1947:1- 1987:4 as possible.

Note to table IV:

"Coeff." gives the OLS regression alope coefficient of real CNP growth
(CNP/CNE'1) on the indicated return at the indicated date.

'ft" gives the t

statistic. "p val" gives the percent probability value of a two sided teat
p value (%)" gives the percent probability

using the t statistic. "Joint

value of the y2 test for joint significance of all returns used to forecast

GMP growth.

Annual return standard errors include a Hansen (1982)

-

Newey-West (1987) correction for serial correlation due to overlap, using
eight covariances (twice the overlap)
