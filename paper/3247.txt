SHORT RATES AND EXPECTED ASSET RETURNS

ABSTRACT
forecast
excess returns
on many alinterest
rates
We present evidence that short-term

ternative assets: foreign exchange, stocks, bonds, and commodities. On average, a onepercentage-point increase in short rates is associated with three percent lower annualized

excess returns. To test whether this predictability is attributable to time-varying risk, independent measures of excess returns are formed using survey data on expected returns.

We find similar predictability in these measures, too. Since the surveys don't include

risk premia, the predictable components cannot be attributed to risk. We suggest that
when short rates are high (low) investors are excessively optimistic (pessimistic) about
alternative-asset returns.

1. Introduction
It is by now well established that excess returns on many financial assets are partially

predictable. Variables useful for explaining returns have been found in each of a growing

list of asset markets. It is well known that one type of variable in particular seems to
forecast returns across many markets: deviations of asset prices from their fundamental
values. Specifically, prices revert toward measures of their own fundamental values more

rapidly than would be predicted by models with constant risk premia.1

In this paper we focus on another variable that seems to have substantial, but lesswell_known predictive power for excess returns: the short-term interest rate.2 When the
U.S. short rate is high, excess returns on foreign exchange, stocks, bonds, and commodities

all appear simultaneously to be low. This apparent systematic correlation of the short rate

with excess returns across assets is very different from the tendency for individual asset

prices to revert toward their own fundamentals. Whereas mean reversion might be suggestive of idiosyncratic predictable components in prices, the forecastability of alternative-

asset returns using interest rates is evidence of a predictable component that is common

across markets. This common component implies that higher short-term interest rates
are associated either with relatively lower risk of holding other assets, or with excessively

optimistic expectations that these alternative assets will match the high promised return

on short-term deposits.

This paper first documents the ability of short rates to forecast returns on a number

of assets. We present evidence in the foreign exchange, stock, bond, and commodity
markets that excess returns are low when short rates are high. The magnitude of the effect

appears both substantial and very similar across markets: a one-percentage-point increase
in the (annualized) short rate is associated on average with about a three-percentage-point
reduction in (annualized) excess returns over the same horizon.3
We then go on to report positive cross-market evidence that consistently suggests this
forecastability is not generated by risk. Specifically, we use a variety of survey measures of

unexpected holding returns in the foreign exchange and bond markets as a complement to

the usual approach of studying total holding returns. The survey measures — unlike total
excess returns — do not include a risk premium, and therefore can provide independent

information on the importance of risk as an explanation for the predictability we document.

The results from these data are striking. First, in almost every case in which surveys

are available, we find that the survey expected returns are informative, in that, ceteris
paribus, they are highly positively correlated with short-term interest rates (as would be
suggested by simple models of relative asset pricing). The implication is that when short
rates are high, expected nominal returns on alternative assets also tend to be high. Second,

for explaining predictable excess returns it makes no difference whether the survey unex-

pected returns or total excess holding returns are used: the predictable component in the
two measures is the same. Thus, unless the surveys happen to mismeasure systematically

the market's expectation in such a way that the measurement error is perfectly correlated
with the risk premium, time-variation in risk cannot explain our results.

Taken together, these findings may suggest that waves of optimism and pessimism
can strike numerons speculative markets at one time, rather than merely affecting isolated

assets in an independent way. While with respect to a single asset the short rate might reasonably be thought of as exogenous, in equilibrium short rates are likely to be endogenously

determined together with expected returns on all other assets. In this sense, movements
in the interest rate, regardless of their ultimate source, may serve as partial indicators of
the markets' overall outlook. This view suggests that when short rates are high, investors

appear willing to go on holding alternative assets because of high expected returns, and
not because the perceived risks of holding those assets are relatively low. Unfortunately,
unusual optimism (or pessimism) in investor expected returns has systematically not been

validated across markets during our samples.

Naturally, these systematic in-sample expectational errors need not be interpreted
as evidence of market irrationality. Results like ours could in principle be explained by

peso problems or learning on the part of purely rational investors, If the samples are
small and/or otherwise unrepresentative of' the ergodic behavior of asset returns, standard
inference procedures will be invalid. Such arguments seem increasingly difficult to make,
however, as economists are rapidly uncovering more of the same predictability in returns

on new instruments, over new time periods, and for new forecast horizons, effectively
increasing the size of the statistical sample.
Thus in short, expected returns across assets — as reflected in the short rate — appear

excessively volatile. Investors would do better to reduce their expected returns on alter-

native assets when short rates are high and raise their expected returns when short rates
are low.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 investigates the ability of the short rate

to forecast excess returns on foreign exchange and shows how this predictability can be
interpreted as excessive volatility in expected returns on foreign exchange. Sections 3, 4,
and 5 follow similar procedures for the stock, bond, and commodity markets, respectively.
Section 6 offers interpretations and conclusions.

2. Excess forecast volatility In expected returns on foreign exchange
This section presents evidence that expected returns on foreign exchange are excessively volatile, in that they appear to move too much with current short rates to be rational
in the sense of Muth. We will see this implies that interest rates can forecast excess returns
on foreign exchange.

The first step is to develop a framework for evaluating whether expected returns are
excessively or insufficiently volatile. The expected return on foreign exchange is equal to
the expected percentage depreciation of the dollar plus the foreign (f-period) interest rate,

or alternatively, the U.S. short (f-period) rate minus a residual, which we term the risk
premium on dollar assets:4
i — rpt,

+1
where

(1)

is the expected log percentage change in the spot rate (expressed in dollars

per unit of foreign currency) between times t and t + 5, conditional on all information
available at time t. Equation (1) implies that expected depreciation can be written as the
=I—1

interest differential less the risk premium,

—

rpt.

Consider a regression of the expectational error made by investors in predicting the
future spot exchange rate on their expected rate of currency depreciation:
A

aAe
Ae —
—a
+ P'.5g3 7t+j'

2

is the realized log percentage change in the spot rate between times t and t+j.

To fix ideas, let us for now suppose that the market's expected rate of depreciation is ac-

tually observable. In testing (1), we obviously would not impose the rational-expectations

restriction that

is equivalent to the mathematical expectation of Aae3 conditional

on all information at time t. Under that restriction, which is the null hypothesis in (1),

a = = 0 and the residual,

is purely random.

of this risk premium.

The alternative hypotheses are that expected depreciation displays excessive (3 <0)
or insufficient (8 > 0) forecast volatility.5 To understand this, suppose that /3 <0. This

would imply that when expected depreciation is above (below) its mean, excess returns
are systematically lower (higher) than expected. An investor would do better — in that the
variance of his forecast error, óst+1 —

As, would be lower — if he systematically reduced

his current expectation of depreciation fractionally toward its mean. This just formalizes

the notion that when investors are relatively optimistic, they tend to be too optimistic.
Similarly if /3 > 0, an investor could improve his forecast by scaling up multiplicatively the

deviation between his current expected depreciation and its mean.
In order to distinguish the U.S. rate's role in generating predictable returns a specification similar to (1) can be used, in which the prediction error is regressed on the components

of expected deprecation:
—

= a + + 1321 + fl3rp + '7j,

where, once again, the null hypothesis is that /i = /32 =

fl

(3)

0 and the residual is

purely random. Equation (3) yields several distinct alternative hypotheses. They are that

expected depreciation is excessively volatile with respect to the U.S. short rate,

< 0,

the foreign short rate, /32 > 0, and perceptions of risk, fl > 0. Opposite inequalities are
associated with insufficient forecast volatility.

While the market's expectation of future depreciation,

is unobservable, infer-

ences about its behavior can nevertheless be drawn by using two proxies. The first and
most common measure of expected depreciation is the forward discount, fdt =

f

—

st,

where f is the log f-period forward rate. By arbitrage, the forward discount is equal to
the interest differential, fdt = it — 1:6

This measure's obvious advantage is that it is readily observable. Its disadvantage is
that by definition it includes any time-varying risk premium that might separate expected

depreciation from the interest differential. From (1), fdt = i — 1

= s7÷ + rpt. Thus,

under this measure the prediction error on the left-hand side of (3) is just the total excess
return on foreign exchange,

—

fdt = LSt+j —

—

As this measure includes

—rpt, the null hypothesis in (3) becomes /i = = 0 and /33 = —1.
Our second proxy for the market's expectation of depreciation comes from time-t
survey measures of exchange rate expectations. This measure, denoted by

is useful

because it is not contaminated by a risk premium. Although the median survey response
is likely to report the market's expectation with error, random measurement errors do not

pose a problem for the estimation because s2 is on the left-hand side of our regressions.
Under this measure of expected depreciation, the dependent variable in (3) is the realized

survey prediction error, st —
Since

one of our expectations measures contains a risk premium while the other does

not, we will be interested in seeing if the two measures yield similar coefficient estimates

when used on the right-hand side of (3). If they don't, then the risk premium remains a

potential explanation for the predictability of excess returns. If they do, however, then
risk is unlikely to be responsible for our findings.

On the right-hand side of (3), only rpt is unobservable. Once again, there are two
possible measures. The first assumes that the forward discount is equal to expected de-

preciation, so that the risk premium is zero (or a constant). This implies that consistent
estimates of 13i and /32 can be obtained without including the premium in the regressions.

The second is the survey measure of the risk premium, given by rp = fdt —
Note that this latter risk measure provides another way of determining whether

If risk

is in fact the culprit, then by including rp on the right-hand side the interest-rate coefficients should fall to zero. Alternatively, if adding rp has no effect on the estimates of $

and $, then risk is unlikely to be responsible for the results.
Before proceeding, several econometric issues should be mentioned. First equation

(3) and the other equations that follow can be estimated using OLS with with standard
errors calculated using Hansen's (1982) Generalized Method-of-Moments (GMM) using a

Newey and West (1987) correction. Where appropriate, the covariance matrix estimators
allow for serial as well as contemporaneous correlation. Estimators were computed twice

for each regression: once under the assumption of honioskedasticity and again allowing
for unknown conditional heteroekedasticity. Due to the downward finite-sample bias of
the heteroskedasticity-consistent GMM covariance estimates, we try to be conservative by
reporting the larger of two sets of standard errors of the coefficients. While this estimation

procedure may be inefficient, the conclusions are unlikely to change using more efficient
techniques.

Another potential difficulty in estimating (3) stems from the possibility that interest

rates contain a unit root. Although many tests do not reject the unit root hypothesis, the
low power of these tests against sensible alternatives suggests that there is little positive

evidence for such a unit root. Nevertheless, in order to avoid these issues, an additional
version of (3) is estimated with (3 = —/32, so that the regressors are the interest differential

and measures of the risk premium.5

2.1. Results
Table 1 presents estimated versions of (3). In the top panel, we report estimates of (3)

in its unrestricted form; in the middle panel we impose the restriction /3i

—/3, so that

the first regressor is the interest differential; in the bottom panel we impose the restriction

/32 =0 to eliminate the foreign interest rate, 1, as a regror.. The data are monthly over

the floating rate period, 1973-1986. Since there are no surveys available over this time
period, the forward discount is the only available proxy for expected depreciation. The
estimates of i are statistically negative, on average equal to minus three. The estimates
of /2 are generally positive (which implies that foreign residents tend to earn low returns

on dollar investments when their own interest rates are high), although less statistically
significant.

Tables 2a through 2c present estimates of (3), for the sample over which there are

survey data, 1981-88. The estimates stack 5 currencies against the dollar (the pound,
French franc, Deutsche mark, Swiss franc and yen) in order to save space.9 The first line
of each panel reports the specification in (3), omitting the risk premium on the right-hand
side. The second line then adds the survey measure of the premium as an additional inde-

pendent variable. The third and fourth lines follow the same pattern except, to guarantee

stationarity, the interest differential is used as a regressor in place the individual interest

rates. The fifth and sixth lines omit the foreign interest rate altogether. Tables 2a, 2b,
and 2c report different forecast horizons of 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively.

The top panels of Tables 2a-2c also use the forward discount to prcy for expected

depreciation. A quick comparison with Table 1 makes it clear that the specific sample
period, forecast horizon, and selection of currencies is of little qualitative importance, as
the findings are very similar. Across these tables almost all of the estimates of

and the

majority of the estimates of/32, are statistically different from zero, with the expected signs.

Indeed, given the size of the estimated standard errors, the point estimates are surprisingly

close, clustering around 3•1O Since the forward discount contains a risk premium, the
results in the lines one, three, and five of the top panels of Tables 2a-2c would usually be

ascribed to time-variation in that premium.

Note, however, that when the survey risk premium is included as a regressor (lines two,

four, and six of the top panels in Tables 2a-2c) there is no change in the either the point
estimates or the standard errors of 8i or fig, and that the estimate of j3 is insignificantly
different from zero.1' if risk were responsible for the findings in odd-numbered lines, then

the estimates of flu and fl2 in even-numbered lines should be indistinguishable from zero

and the estimate of fl should be minus one. However, random measurement errors in rp
could also bias the estimates in this direction.

The bottom panel of Tables 2a through 2c duplicates the regressions run in the top
panel, only this time using the survey measure of expected depreciation on the left-hand
side. Here, even if the surveys do contain random measurement error, the estimates remain

unbiased. The results in Tables 2a-2c show without exception that (Ji <0 and usually

that /2 > 0. The similarity of the signs and magnitudes of the coefficients in the top
and bottom panels of each table is striking. This again suggests that any risk premium
contained in the forward-rate prediction errors is not responsible for the predictability of
excess returns. Indeed, even if the surveys were pure noise, they still do not contain a risk

premium, and therefore risk cannot explain the similarity between the top and bottom
panels.12

Neither the point estimates nor the estimated standard errors are importantly affected

by the restriction that /3 = —fl in the third and fourth lines of each panel.'3 This
indicates that our results in the top two lines are not a direct consequence of any potential
nonstationarity in interest rate levels. The estimates of flu in the fifth and sixth lines remain

negative, but tend to be smaller in magnitude and somewhat less statistically significant.

The similarity of all the reported estimates of fl and fl supports the view that

expected depreciation is excessively volatile, and that

is excessively sensitive to

changes in short rates. When the return on short deposits is high, investors' appear to
have overly optimistic expectations about the returns on competing assets like foreign

exchange. Investors would do better if they reduced their expectations of depreciation
when the short rate is above its mean value (and conversely when the short rate is below).

Even though the surveys don't contain a risk premium, one might ask whether they
do contain any information at all, i.e., whether they are informative about expected depre-

ciation. If ex ante rates of return on short bills in different currencies are approximately
equalized, one would expect an increase in the interest differential to be associated with
a one-for-one increase in expected depreciation. Froot and Frankel (1989) regress the survey measure of expected depreciation on the interest differential and find the coefficient is

indeed close to one, while statistically much greater than zero.

3. Excess forecast volatility in expected stock-market returns
This section develops analogous regression tests for expected stock-market returns.

To do this, first write the expected return on the market as equal to the short rate plus
an "equity premium:"4

r1 —

pe

•-P+Dt =
1 + l't,
P

(5)

where P is the market's expected stock price at time t+j conditional on all information
available at time t, P is the time-t stock price, D is the current dividend payment, and 'g
is the equity premium. Equation (5) implies that the expected rate of price appreciation

is given by the short rate less the dividend yield plus the equity premium,

pe

-Pt = — D

.

(6)

we work with nominal retur,, , includes a term attributabl, to the correlabon betwu unexpected inflation
and the excess stock return. See the appendix for more detaila.

10

Consider then a regression of the excess (risk-adjusted) return on the components of
expected appreciation,

rg3 —

r1 = a + 811t — 132V +

(7)

where the dependent variable is equivalent the unexpected percentage change in prices,
rt+j — rt+,

=

.

We

do not have any independent measure of the equity premium,

so we assume it to be included in the constant term. The hypothesis that expectations are
rational thus implies that 13i = 132 = 0 and the residual is purely random. The alternative

hypothesis is that 13i is less or greater than zero: that expected stock-market returns are
excessively or insufficiently volatile, respectively, with respect to the short rate.

From (5), the expected total stock return is equal to the interest rate plus an equity

premium. This suggests an alternative regression to (7), in which the excess return is
regressed on the short rate alone. We try this specification in addition to (7) below.

3.1. Results
We use the monthly value-weighted index from the Center for Research in Securities

Prices (CRSP) for the stock return data. The series runs from 1926 to 1985. Monthly
interest rates on U.S. government securities with approximately one month to maturity
come from Ibbotson Associates (1986).15 In order to take advantage of high frequency
stock returns we also used two measures of seven-day interest rates: the rate on eurodollar
deposits and repurchase agreements.

Table 3a presents estimates of (7). The results are similar to those in the previous
tables, although the coefficients appear different during early portions of the sample. Over

most of the post-war sample, however, increases in short rates reliably result in negative
excess stock market returns.16

11

Table 3b presents similar estimates deleting the dividend yield regressor.17 Without
dividends, estimates from higher-frequency data can be obtained. The first row reports the

results from weekly data over the period 1973-84, using the seven-day eurodollar interest
rate. The second row of Table 3b uses a seven-day interest rate on repurchase agreements
collateralized by U.S. government securities, available from DRI beginning in 1980. Both

estimates of fi are statistically negative at the one-percent level. In rows 3 through 10 of
Table 3b we report estimates for longer horizons (one year and one month) over the full
Ibbotson sample and over a number of subsamples. All but one of the estimates of flu are

less than zero, though none is as large or statistically significant as in the weekly data.
Unfortunately, there is no second measure of expected stock returns to appeal to for
further evidence on whether the above results are generated by time-varying risk. However,

note that the point estimates in Tables 3a and 3b are similar to those in the foregoing
tables.18

4. Excess forecast volatility in expected bond returns
Our third set of tests covers expected returns in the bond market. Under the linearized

model of the term structure of interest rates, the excess (risk-adjusted) holding periodreturn is proportional to the market's expectational error in predicting the future interest

(10)

The null hypothesis in (10) is that 13i = /32 = = 0 and the residual is purely random1
whereas the alternative hypotheses are that expected interest rate changes are excessively
volatile with respect to short rates (/3i <0), long rates (/32 > 0), and term premia (/33 > 0).
Insufficient volatility is associated with the opposite inequalities.

As in section 2, there are two available measures of the expected future interest rate,

(j3))e, which from (8) appears implicitly on the left-hand side of (10). First is the
standard one — the time-t forward interest rate on a k —f-period instrument to be acquired

in j periods:

Of course, when using the

forward rate to measure the expected future interest rate, the time-t expected excess
holding return is zero, so the dependent variable in (10) is simply the total excess holding

Our second measure of the expected future interest rate, given by ())3,

comes

from time-t surveys of interest rate expectations of the k —j-period rate at time t +j. The
surveys allow us to compute the realized excess holding return in (8) a second way, which

we denote as h) — (h")'. Because this measure of excess holding returns is computed
directly from expectations, without reference to forward rates, it does not include a term
premium. Thus, any predictable component found in this measure of excess returns cannot

be attributed to risk.

all in our regressions. The second comes from the survey measure of the term premium,

, which can be computed from (9) using the survey expectation in place of ('÷, )

If including (93.S)3 has no effect on the coefficients flu and /2, then risk is unlikely to be
the explanation for any predictability based on short and long rates.

4.1. Results

Estimates of equation (10) are reported in Tables 4a through 4f for a number of
different instruments and forecast horizons. As in section 2, each table contains two panels;

the top uses the total excess holding return, h4), as the dependent variable, while the
bottom uses survey unexpected holding return,

—

(h").

In order to permit

comparison between panels, both samples are constructed on the survey dates (the last
Friday of each quarter from 1969 to 1986) 22
The first line in each panel includes only short and long rates as independent variables;

the second line then adds the survey term premium. The third and fourth lines are similar,

except that the spread,

—

is

used in place of individual short and long rates. If long

and short rates are nonstationary but contain a common unit root, then the spread will

be stationary.23 Finally, in the fifth and sixth lines the long rate is omitted altogether.
The interest-rate survey data come from surveys conducted by the Goldsmith-Nagan

Bond and Money Market Letter, now published in the investor newsletter, Reporting on

Governments. Expectations are of future interest rates on the Bond Buyer Index, the
30-year mortgage rate, and 12-month Treasury bills.24 Forecast horizons are three and six
months.25

Tables 4a and 4b cover the Bond Buyer index at forecast horizons of 3 and 6 months,
respectively. Tables 4c and 4d do the same for 30-year mortgages, while Tables 4e and 4f

cover 12-month Treasury bills. In each of these six tables, all of the estimates of flj, are
negative. In addition, most are statistically significant and have magnitudes which roughly

correspond to those in prior tables. Most estimates of 132 are statistically positive. Also,
the inclusion of

in lines two, four, and six of each panel has no effect on the interest

rate coefficients. Finally, the estimates in the top and bottom panels are very similar,
suggesting that the term premium is not responsible for the predictability of standard
measures of excess holding returns.26
The results in Tables 4a through 4f suggest that excess returns on longer-term bills and

bonds exhibit excess forecast volatility. In particular, expected returns respond excessively

positively to increases in the short rate. When the short rate is high (holding constant the

long rate and term premium), future rates expected by investors are low, and therefore
investors' expected returns are high. Since on average in such circumstances realized future

rates do not turn out to be so low, the realized holding returns on bonds systematically
do not turn out to be as high as expected.2728

The weakest evidence for this hypothesis is found in Tables 4. and 4f, which use 12-month Treasury bills. Although the
sign, of the coeMclents are as expected, their estimated magnitudes do appear to shift between top and bottom panels.

31Many authors, such s Mankiw and Summers (1984), find that the long rate is insu5!ciwtb' volatile with respect to
changes in the short rate. The description above should help clarify how their result, are consistent with our finding of
exceuiva vanatility of expected r,turn,. If when the short rate rises, the long rate tens to rise as well (Instead of remaining

15

As in section 2, it is consoling to have some positive evidence that the survey measures

are indeed informative about expected interest rate changes. Froot (1989b) shows that the

survey expected interest rate changes are highly positively correlated with the difference

between long and short rates. Holding risk constant, of course, expected future interest
rates should increase whenever the long rate rises relative to the short rate.29

5. Commodity Markets
Our final application is to commodity markets. As in the earlier examples, we wish
to regress the market's expectational error in predicting the future return on commodities

on the market's expected rate of return. The market's expected return from time t to t +j
can be expressed as the rate of price appreciation less storage costs:

c+j —

= lt+'Yg,

is the time-t expected percentage price appreciation from t to t + j,

where

(U)
is the

storage cost over j periods at time t expressed as a percentage of the commodity price C,

and

is a commodity risk premium.30
Thus our regression equation becomes:

C3 —

= a + /3iit + P2 +

(12)

where we have left off the risk premium, -ye, from the right-hand side, as we have no survey

data with which to measure it directly. As above, the null hypothesis is that 13i = /2 = 0
and the residual is purely random; the alternatives that expected appreciation is excessively

volatile imply that fl <0 and/or /32 <0.
constant), future rates expected by investors are not so low, ,.nd theralor. expected r.turig are not so high. Thus, if the long

rate were to rise suMciently when the short rat. increas.s (again holding risk constant), the predictability of retun based on
the spread would be eliminated.
' One might intirpret these result. as suggesting that the survey respondent. m.rely report the forward rate instead of their
actual apectaon. Froot (159b) shows that the responses differed subetantially from forward rates, and that the implied term
prernia appear sensible (as. especially Figure 4 in that paper).
"Not, that we hay, dropped thej superscript for the short rate, as it is no longar nec.aary. See the appendix for more
detail on

,.

16

Storage costs can be measured by noting the forward discount on commodities — the

difference between log forward and spot rates, which we denote by cdt — is equal to the

interest rate plus the storage fees: cd = i +

5.1. Results
Table 5 presents our estimates of (11). As above, we estimate (11) both with and

without the constraint that f3 = $2. That is, we first regress the excess return on the
interest rate and storage cost, and then regress it on their sum cdg = i +

The data

are for 3 major metals: lead, nickel, and silver. Spot and 3-month forward prices for these

are recorded each month. Unfortunately, the time series are rather short. Although the
samples run almost nine years, with a 3-month forecast horizon there are fewer than 36
nonoverlapping observations.

All the estimates of /3i and 132 are negative, and a few are statistically significant.
This suggests that an increase in the short rate — holding storage costs fixed — is associated

on average with lower excess returns. The estimates are also similar in magnitude to what

we found in the foreign exchange market, stock, and bond markets above. Although there

are no survey data on commodity prices for us to appeal to, the presence of a similar
correlation between excess returns and short rates in all of these markets, and the fact
that whenever surveys are used these correlations persist, suggest that commodity returns
also display excess forecast volatility with respect to the short rate.

31With the conaaint $ = $ imposed, the regressions si•e similar to thoee reported by Fama and Frenth (1986). Although
their selection of commodities differ, from our,, their findings are not importantly diffeent for nonseesonal commodities.
Seasonal commodities have large predictable components thaI ar. tlearly associated with movements in storage costs; they tend
to yield estimates of 02 that are near zero.

17

6. Conclusions
This paper develops simple regression tests capable of distinguishing excessive volatil-

ity in expected returns. In doing so we find a striking regularity in excess returns across
different asset markets, subsamples and forecast horizons: returns are negatively correlated

with short-term interest rates. The size and statistical significance of our estimates of this
relation are also comparable across different assets.

In a certain sense, this paper is not the first to document the interest rate's ability to
predict excess returns for these markets. Giovannini and Jorion (1987) find direct evidence
in the foreign exchange market, while Fama and Schwert (1977) and Keim and Stambaugh
(1986), among others, report similar evidence for the stock and bond markets. In addition,
there are many studies which find forward discounts to be statistically negatively correlated

with excess returns in the foreign exchange, bond, and commodity markets. In the foreign
exchange market, the forward discount is equal to the difference between the domestic and

foreign interest rates; in the stock market it is equal to the short rate less the dividend
yield; in the bond market it is proportional to the difference between the short and long

rates; and in commodity markets it is equal to the short rate plus storage costs. Thus,
all these results might be interpreted as evidence of the empirical regularity the present
paper focuses on.32

As always, our results using forward rates alone could in principle be explained by
time-varying risk premia. However, we take the additional step of employing survey data
on asset return expectations as an independent test of whether the time-varying-risk expla-

nation has merit. Surveys are useful as an alternative measure of expected future returns,

one that is free from interference by a risk premium. In virtually every case in which
the survey excess returns are used alongside of the actual excess returns, the sign and
magnitude of the predictable component of the data remain unchanged. Since the survey

excess returns do not include a risk premium, these results suggest that expected returns

are excessively volatile with respect to short rate changes.

While it appears that the predictability we document is evidence of systematic insample forecast errors, it is important to remember that these errors are not themselves

evidence of gross misjudgment by investors. To see that the magnitude of the errors
is small, take as an example a $1000 one-month investment in British pounds (the first

regression in Table 1). If the U.S. short rate falls by one percentage point, the results
suggest that excess returns rise by 2.488 percent, which implies a one-month unpriced gain
of $lOOO(O2488 = $2.07

(neglecting compounding). The monthly standard error of the

regression, however, is 3.1 percent. Thus, the standard deviation of these extra one-month

returns is $31.00! This is similar to the high risk-return tradeoff implicit in other studies

that report predictability of short-horizon excess returns. It may be that there is not
a sufficient number of fully-informed, low-transaction-cost traders to fully eliminate the
regularity we have identified above.

19

7. Appendix
The "risk premia" for the assets discussed above are defined as the total required excess

returns above the riskiess nominal interest rate. As is well-known, as long as unexpected
changes in goods prices are correlated with unexpected changes in the asset's price, not all

of the required excess return will be attributable to investors' risk aversion. For example,

in a world of risk-neutral investors, it is possible for the nominal expected return on an
asset to be less than the nominal interest rate. This will occur if those states in which the

asset happens to pay off large dollar amounts also turn out to be those in which a dollar
purchases more goods.

To see this more formally, consider the following derivation. A necessary condition
for the representative investor's intertemporal optimization is the Euler equation:

(Al)

E(mt+1tPt(l
+r+i)) = 1,
Pt+i

where Et() is the expectation operator, applied conditional on all available information

at time t, mt+1 =

6.i) is the discounted ratio of marginal utilities of consumption

between time t + 1 and time t, P is the time-t dollar price of consumption, and r1 is
the nominal return on the ith asset between time t + 1 and time t. When applied to the
riskiess rate, r(, condition (Al) for the riskiess nominal rate implies that E (,+Pt)

1.

Using this fact, expression (Al), and some simple algebra, we can write the total excess

required return on the ith asset as:
•

—
t(rt+l) — rt —

covg

(r÷1 — r()) + Et (mgi) Et (-j-(r+i — to)
+ Et (mi) E (Fj)
COVt (mt+i,

(mt÷1,

(A2)

where covt() is the time-t conditional covariance operator.

We can then split up expression (A2) into two terms: the first due to the correlation
between innovations in inflation and asset prices, and the second to risk aversion alone:
5•

(

— rf —

,_.g,-,-——r

,—r/—rai

E (JT)
20

,

$

—,-- rat,

where the term ra is zero if investors are risk neutral. The first term on the right-hand
side of (A3) is derived from (A2) under the assumption that investors are risk neutral.
Let investors' unexpected holding return on the ith asset be given by:

rt+l —

L'($

$

— ct+1.

(A4)

Then using equations (A3) and (A4) we can express the total realized excess return on
asset i as:
—

= (r;+1 — E(r+1)) + (Et(r+i) — r()

(A5)

Et(p&_(r+i_r(_ra))
/ ,,
+rat,
Et(1f—
V t+1

In the text the latter two terms are referred to as the risk premium. Note however, that

the survey unexpected return is a measure of (A4), and therefore, that it contains neither
of these latter two terms. In our regressions we find the correlation of (A4) with different

regressors to be the same as the correlation of (A5) with those same regressors. Thus,
neither of the latter two terms in (A5) is likely to be responsible for the predictability of
realized excess returns we document.

Notes to Tables 2a-2c: The top and bottom panels use, respectively, forward-rate prediction
errors and exchange-rate survey prediction errors as dependent variables. Within each panel, the
third and fourth sets of estimates use lg — as the first independent variable, thus imposing
the restriction that 8
Interest rates are the average of the bid and ask on 12-month
eurodeposits. Data are sampled each 6 weeks from June 1981 to August 1988, Data for 5 currencies
(pound, Fench franc, mark, Swiss franc, and yen) are stacked. Each currency is given its own
intercept term (not reported). Standard errors are calculated using GMM allowing for arbitrary
serial and cross-sectional correlation, and for heteroskedasticity where appropriate. Superscripts a
b and C represent statistical significance at the 10, 5 and 1 percent levels, respectively.
