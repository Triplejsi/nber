WHAT MAKES

A YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR?

ABSTRACT

The paper studies the factors which shape entrepreneurship among
young adults.

It finds, using data on a British birth cohort, that the

of self-employment depends sensitively upon whether
the individual ever received a gift or inheritance. Those who were

probability

given or inherited £5,000, for example, were approximately twice as
likely, ceteris paribus, to set up in business. Thisis consistent with,

and a new test of, recent results from the US stressing the
importance of capital and liquidity constraints. The paper also
evaluates a number of hypotheses suggested in the literature on
small businesses.

"For many commentators this is the era of the entrepreneur. After
years of neglect, thosewho start and manage their own businesses

are viewed as popular heroes. They are seen as risk-takers and
innovatorswho reject the relative security of employment in large
organisarions to create wealth and accumulate capital. Indeed,
according to many, the economic recovery of the European
economies is largely dependent upon their ambitions and efforts."
(Goffee and Scase (1987), p.1.))

Introduction
This paper explores the forces which make and shape entrepreneurs. Public and political
interestin this topic is now high and a small economics literature is beginning to be established.
Nevertheless,

it is still true that economists have a lot to learn about entrepreneurship, and the

paper's aim is to contribute to this endeavour.

The main reason that governments have taken keen interest in the determinants of
entrepreneurship is that they see small businesses as a source of new jobs. Thisis one rationale -stimulated in part by the work of Birch (1979) -- for fostering entrepreneurship. Another is that
entrepreneurial activity is ultimately the mainspring of growth and development in a free market
economy, so there are grounds to wish to understand it and, where feasible, to improve its quality.

The primary difficulty for the social scientist is that entrepreneurs are rare. It is not easy to get data
on sufficiently largesamples to allow careful statistical analysis. In consequence, muchresearch
has relied upon anecdotal evidence and ad hoc surveys.

Our object in this paper is to exploit a large random sample, the National Child
Development Study, which provides detailed histories on all those born in Great Britain in the

2
weekof the 3rd to 9th March 1958. Although the data allow us to examine the influence on selfemployment

of a whole range of variables, the particular concern of the paper is to test in the

British context the liquidity constraint hypothesis proposed recently by US economists David
Evans, Boyan Jovanovic and co-authorsW. Using American micro data, papers such as Evans
and Leighton (1989) and Evans and Jovanovic (1989) conclude that imperfect credit markets
constrain entrepreneurs. They base their judgement on econometric tests in which wealthier people

are shown to be more likely, ceteris paribus, to switch from paid employment into selfemployment.
This idea has practical significance. If potential entrepreneurs are held back largely by lack

of capital, a government that wished to foster entrepreneurial behaviourcould do so by giving
subsidies or grants to these individuals. The paperprovides what we believe to be the first British
test of this hypothesis, and (somewhat against our expectations) finds strong evidence for the
liquidity constraint hypothesis. The test itselfis methodologically novel, because it uses data on
gifts and inheritances. Studying the behaviour of those who are given money is presumably as
close as the economist can get to a laboratory experiment in which some subjects are given capital
while those in a control group are not. We find that those who receivedgifts or inheritances are
more likely in 1981 to run their own business. This is true holding constant a group of personal,
family and geographicalcharacteristics. The effect is large and is not the result of offspring
inheriting family businesses.
The paper also tests a number of hypotheses proposed in the small business literature (see,

for example, Curran (1986) and Curran and Burrows (1988)). Is it the case that self-employment
is more likely for thoseindividuals
a) unemployed in the past

b) with a self-employed father
c) who worked at part-time jobs while children

d) living in areas of highunemployment?
We attempt to evaluate these and related questions.

3
The paper has the following structure. Section 1 sets Out the theoretical background and
Section 2 summarizes the features of the data set. The econometric findings are given in Section 3.
Section 4 states the paper's conclusions.

Section 1. Theoretical Background
In this section we outline a conceptual framework for the analysis of self-employment.
Consider a model in which individuals value "independence' in its own right. This assumes that a

of
person's utility may depend upon the way in whichincome is earned and notjust upon the level
income. Assume that individual i must choose a careereither as a worker or as an entrepreneur.
Entrepreneurs start businesses and employ those who choose to be workers. The latter earn wage

w with certainty. The former, those who become self-employed,receive net income

y=øf(n)-wn-k

(1)

where 0 is entrepreneurial ability, f(n) is output, n is employment and k is capital. It is assumed
that

a given level of k is required to run a business (it could be thought of as an "office" or

equivalent). Employment is chosen optimally.

The distribution of entrepreneurial ability in the population is taken to be g(o). As in
Kanbur (1982), individuals do not know their own ability until they set up in business. After that

is revealed they earn income
y(w, k, 0) = max Of(n) - wn - k.

n

(2)

Individuals derive utility from two sources. One is from income; the other is from being
their own boss. Withoutloss of generality, assume that people can be ordered by their desire for
independence. Assume that expected utility for an entrepreneuris separable and may be written:

Eu=i+Ey

(3)

where E is the expectations operator, and i denotes the utility, for individual of type i, from being
'independent" and having no boss. As a worker, however, individual i is taken to receive utility u

= w. It is straightforward to generalize this approach to include risk-aversion.
Individual i chooses self-employmentoverwage-work if

4

i+ (y(w,k,Ø)g(Ø)dØw.
J

(4)

When the non-pecuniary and (expected) pecuniary benefits from entrepreneurship are sufficiently
high, the individual chooses to set up in business and to employ other individuals. Ex post, define

i

a function i = (w, k, 0) which captures the indifference locus given by the implicit function

i+y(w,k,Ø)-w=O.

(5)

By differentiation,
i0 = -f(n)<O

=-f'(n)

(6)

<0.

(7)

Hence thereexists a concave relationship between the marginal level of entrepreneurial ability and
the marginal level of utility from independence. This is sketched in Figure 1. The figure shows

those combinations of independence of spirit (i) and business ability (0) that make marginal
entrepreneurs indifferent between self-employmentand wage-work.
As Figure 1 illustrates, those individuals on the margin of becoming entrepreneurs can have
different combinations ofindependence and ability. High-ability people need onlya low desire for
independence for it to be optimal for them to set up in business, and vice versa for low-ability
entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs neednot earn more than workers: part of the return comes in nonpecuniary form.

It is interesting to consider the characteristics of market equilibrium in this model.

First,

free entry into entrepreneurship and wage-work requires that, at the margin, each offer the same
utility. Second, it is movements in the wage which act to bringabout overall equilibrium. If the
wage rate is high, the returns to being an entrepreneur are low, so that individuals will be
disinclined to set up business; they will moveinto wage-work, thereby putting downward pressure

on wages.

If the wage is low, entrepreneurial profits will be large, and the opposite flow will

occur.
Labour market equilibrium can be characterized

as in Figure 2. Free entry ensures that
(unconstrained) equilibria lie on the 450 line. The other locus is downward-sloping because y (w,
k, 0) is a declining function of the wage rate. At the equilibrium intersection, the level of workers
wages

is just sufficient to equate the marginal entrepreneurs net return (pecuniary plus non-

pecuniaiy) withhis or her alternative income in wage-work. It is straightforward to show that

i) a rise in entrepreneurial spirits (average values of i) in the economy reduces the average
equilibrium financial return to self-employment and raises the wage, and
ii) a rise in entrepreneurial ability (averagevalues of 0) in the economy increases both the
average equilibrium return to self-employmentand the wage rate.
Although the model identifies theoretically the determinants of entrepreneurship, and suggests
why they matter at the aggregate level, the aim must be to make the ideas operational.

Section 2. Data
The National Child Development Study is a longitudinal survey which takes as its subjects
all those living in Great Britain who were born between the 3rd and 9th March 1958. The survey
has been sponsored by five UK Government Departments - the Departments of Health and Social
Security (DHSS), Education and Science (DES), Employment (DE), Environment (DOE) and the
Manpower Services Commission (MSC). Since the original Pen-natal Mortality Study was
undertaken in 1958, majorsurveys were also carried out in 1965 (NCDSI), 1969 (NCDS2), 1974
(NCDS3) and 1981 (NCDS4). For the purposes of the first three surveys, the birth cohort was
augmented by including those new immigrants born in the relevant week, and information was
obtained separately from parents, teachers, and doctors, as well as memberof the NCDS cohort.

The 1981 survey differs in that no attempt was made to include new immigrants since 1974 and

of 12,537 interviews(2), namely, approximately 76
percent of the original target sample and 93 percent of those tracedand contacted by interviewers.
The 1981 survey contained a total

The interviewsurvey was carried out between August 1981 and March

1982. For

furtherdetails

of the surveys, see Elias and Blanchflower (1988, 1989).
The National Child Development Study reveals that in 1981 only a small percentage of
twenty-three year olds were self-employed. Of the approximately 12,500 people on whom we
have records, just over 500 were working full-time in self-employment, slightly under 100 were
self-employed in a part-time capacity, while a further 100 individuals had been self-employed in
their first or last job but were not working at the time of interview. Hence only one in twenty
young people worked in a job which they had themselves created.
Table 1 provides the raw figures. We distinguish between individuals who:

(i) were self-employed individuals, with assets, who employed others ('Assets and employees');
(ii) were self-employed with employees but no assets (these two categories were combined
because there were only twelve individuals in the second group);
(iii) were self-employed at the time of interview and had assets but no employees ('Assets'): in the
above definitions, 'assets' is taken to include property, machinery, vehicle stocks and materials;
(iv) were self-employed with neither assets nor employees ('Neither assets nor employees');
(v) were employees in their main activity but were also self-employed part-time ('Part-time');
(vi) were not working at the time of interview but whose first and/or last job was self-employed
('First and last ');
(vii) were working or running a family firm.

The 'employee' category includes bothfull-time and part-time employees while the 'unempioyed'
category includes those awaiting a job, those who wanted

a job and those who admitted they did

not wish to work. Finally, the 'OLF' category includes those individuals who were sick, in
prison, engaged in housework or on a long holiday.

the time of interview. Self-employment is the fourth largest category: it comes below that for
employees (8,600), that for those out of the labour force (1,800) and that for the unemployed
(1,200). The Table reveals that the self-employed are predominantly male.

In the empirical analysis that follows we restrict ourselves to individuals who were either
employed or self-employed at the time of interview in 1981. This gives a sample size of 7,179

of whom 7.2% were self-employed. Sample means and standarddeviations of
variable used in the following section are reported in Appendix A. Appendix B provides details of
observations,

the variables.

Section 3. Results
Entrepreneurial activity is, of course, shaped by a multitude of forces. Using NCDS data,

Payne (1984) and Blanchflower and Oswald(1988a, l988b) identified a number of results using
bivariate cross-tabulations. One object of our analysis is to employ multivariate methods to
examinesimilar issues.

In this paper the dependent variable is set to one if the individual

is self-

employed (two different definitions are used) and to zero otherwise.
Tables 2-5 present the econometric results from estimating probit equations(3). Results

for the greatest number of entrepreneurs --

those

individuals who report any form of self-

employment - are presented in Table 2. The Table includes, among other variables, the kinds of
personal characteristics conventional from micro-econometric work. Thus gender and education,

both affect the likelihood of entrepreneurial behaviour (as measured by self-employment status).
Males and those individuals with 5 0-levels or 1 A-level are more likely than others to be selfemployed. A person with children or a self-employed wife also has a higher probability. Health

and race have no statistically significant impact(4).
There is some evidence that spatial factors matter. People in East Anglia are the least likely

tcrun their own businesses (followed by the East Midlands, whichis not statistically significant at
the 5% level). The county unemployment rate enters negatively in the equation, but has a t-statistic

of only 1.8. This is weak evidence that high unemployment in the local area produces fewer
enepreneurs ceteris naribus. The evidence is stronger in subsequent Tables.

The single most statistically significant influence is whether or not the individual has ever

been a memberof a trade union, which enters negatively. Vai-ious interpretations of this are
possible.

Our own would be that those who join unions are likely to be politically and

psychologically antipathetic to the idea of setting up in business.

Two elements in Table 2 suggest that entrepreneurship is shaped in conflicting ways by a
history of personal movement and upheaval. First, those who moved regions (1974-1981) were
less likely, in our sample, to be self-employed. Second, the number of jobs since school

is

positively associated withthe likelihood of self-employment (with a t-statistic of more than 8).

One of the advantages of the National Child Development Study is that it records
psychological information about the individuals when they were children. Three variables emerge
as especially useful predictors:

i)

unforthcomingness syndrome

ii)

hostility to children syndrome

iii)

anxiety for acceptance syndrome.

All were from reports provided by teachers when the respondents were seven years of age. Each
is statistically significant, and they reveal together that the self-employed were less likely than
average (as children) to be anxious for acceptance or unforthcoming, and more likely than average
to show hostility to other children. We take this as evidence that psychological factors play a role

in moulding the entrepreneurial drive.
In the 1981 survey the respondents were asked about what factors they believedto be
important in any new job. The self-employed were more likely than others to say (i) the chance to
work with one'shands, (ii) the opportunity to work outdoors and (iii) the ability to earn high pay.
Father's occupation in NCDS2 is a statistically significant variable. The likelihood an
individual

is self-employed is positively related to the father being a manager or a farmer, and

negatively (though the t-statistic is only 1.46)to the father being unskilled.
Are entrepreneurs people who enjoy taking risks? Thisquestion has not been testedin the

literatureand can not be studied completely adequately here. However, data on the individual's

14

j

gambling behavior are available in the National Child Development Study. As Table 2 makes
clear, betting is

more common among the self-employed. All

of the betting variables enter

negatively, and betting once or twice a week has a t-statistic greater than 3.

Anotherpredictorof entrepreneurial drive is whether the individual worked while a child.
The 3rd sweep of NCDS, in 1974, when the respondent was 16 years of age, contains information

on the jobs held prior to leaving high school. Thosewho had both a weekend and weekday job

at

that time in their lives were more likely, as Table 2 shows, to be self-employed at age 23.

Of central importance to our analysis, and stimulated partly by the recent work of Evans
and Jovanovic (1989) and Evans and Leighton (1989), is the issue of whether capital liquidity
constraints are important in the starting of businesses, Our work attempts to providea new test of
this hypothesis. The variables Inheritance' and 'Inheritance squared denote the level and square

of the size of an inheritance received by the individual. The entered variable was the largest
amount the family unit received as indicated in response to the question:
"Have you (or your husband/wife/partner) ever inherited or receivedas a gift
from anotherperson, money, properly, or other goods to the value of £500 or
more?"

Q. 9, p. 68, NCDS 4.
The two observations categorized as 'over £100,000' were coded as £200,000. The distribution

of inheritances and/or gifts is given below:

Both inheritance variablesin Table 2 are statistically significant. Our results confirm the
raw correlations foundin Payne (1984). They show that the size of the inheritance enters a selfemployment probit in a non-linear way. For inheritances up to £15,400 the probability

of self-

employment rises; beyond that it declines. It is notable that this concave structure is similar to that
found, for family assets, in Evans and Jovanovic (1989) and Evans and Leighton (1989). Our
evidence is consistent withtheir claim that
'the data point to liquidity constraints: capital is essentialfor starting a
businessand liquidityconstraintstend to exclude those with insufficient
fitnds at their disposal"
(p. 808, Evans and Jovanovic (1989)).

One possible objectionto the finding is that inheritance could play an important role in
entrepreneurship among the young merely because some individuals inheritfamily firms. Thus it

is useful to checkthe conclusions on a sample which excludes individuals who are self-employed
within a family business.

Table 4, which uses the dependentvariable 'self-employed but not in a family firm, is
similar to Table 2. In total, 158 of the 606 individuals in the data file who were self-employed
reported that they worked in a family firm. This is made up
employees, 28%

of 46% of those with assets and

of those with assets and no employees, and 11% with neither assets nor

employees (see Table 1). Apart from a loss

of precision on the squared inheritance term --

presumably because of the smaller mean of the dependent variable -- the only obvious difference is

in the performance of the measures of father's occupation. Interestingly, the categories showing
the father as

a farmer behave differentlyfrom Tables 2 and 3. In particular,the variable for

'farmer: own account' goes from strongly positive to somewhat negative, which suggests that the
coefficient picksup the inheritance of farms by offspring.

A substantive difficultyis that many of these variablescan be viewed as endogenously
determined with self-employment. Because identification is then problematic, we also estimated
restricted versions in which only clearly predetermined regressors were included. The results are

given in Tables 3 and 5. The restrictedversions give almost identical results to Tables 2 and 4.

The coefficients on the inheritance variables, for example, are unaffected by moving to the
restricted models.

To study the quantitative importance of inheritancewe constructed a number of hypothetical
cases, using the model estimated in Table 2, and calculated how the probability of self-employment

varies with changes in the size of the inheritance. Table 6 gives the results of two typical
outcomes. It shows that comparatively small increases in inheritance have large effects on the
probability of running a business. Individuals who received £5,000 are approximately twice as

likely to be self-employed than those who received nothing. The probability peaks at
approximately £14,000 in Tables 2-5, and by £50,000 shrinks to zero.
Section 4.

Conclusions

Entrepreneurship

is one of the most elusive and least understood forms of economic

behaviour. We have followed

a small but growing literature by focusing on a particular type of

entrepreneur -- the self-employed individual -- in an attempt to use microeconometric methods to
discover what moulds those who start their own businesses. The data set is the National Child
Development Study(5), whichprovides longitudinal information on all Britons born in the week of
the 3rd to the 9th March 1958.

What is it that makes a young entrepreneur? Our empirical analysis identifies many
factors,but one stands out. These British data support the hypothesis -- recently examined by US
economists -- that entrepreneurs face capital and liquidity constraints. It appears that the effect is
large. The results suggest, for example, that a gift or inheritance of £5,000 approximately doubles
a typical individual's probability of setting up his or her own business(6).

The statistical analysis -- summarizing information on a heterogeneous group of
entrepreneurs -- suggest also that individuals are more likely to be self-employed if they (i) are
men, with children and a self-employed wife, (ii) have a father who was a manager of an enterprise
employing less than 25 people or was a farmer, (iii) had,as a schoolchild, a weekend and weekday

job, (iv) havenever joineda trade union, (v) havenever been out of the labour force, (vi) do not
gamble, (vii) favour jobs 'with good pay' or working out

of doors' or 'working with their

21
or anxious for acceptance,
(ix) live outside East Anglia, (x) have an educational level of four 0-levels to one A-level, (xi did
hands, (viii) were,

as a child, hostile to others, but not unforthcoming

an apprenticeship, (xii) had manyjobs after leaving school, (xiii) and have not moved regions in
the previous seven years. Thereis also some evidence that individuals are more likely to be selfemployed if they live in an area of low unemployment.
The conclusion that capital and liquidity constraints are influential has implications for
economic policy. Although any econometric resultshould be treated cautiously, the estimates n
this paper are consistent with the idea that entrepreneurship can be fostered by financial giants, arid
they provide tentative information about the size

of the response to different levels of such

transfers. This should be of interest to any government which believes that Britain needs more
entrepreneurs.

(1) A detailed survey of the literature is given in the previous version of this paper, Blanchflower
and Oswald (1990). The principal micro-econometric papers are Fuchs (1982), Rees and
Shah (1986), Pickles and OFarrell (1987), Borjas and Bronars (1989), Evans and
Jovanovic (1989), Borjas (1986) and Evans and Leighton(1989). OECD (1986) and Blau
(1987) are aggregate time-series studies.
(2) Inevitably, given the long span of time over which NCDS has been collected, some of the
individuals have droppedout of the survey. These youngsters either died, refused to
respond, moved and were not traced, emigrated or were lost through administrative errors.
There are reasons to believe that this attrition is not random (see Elias and Blanchflower
(1989) for a discussion of this issue). Our current work is concerned with identifying the
extent of any biases thus created. Although we are conscious of the weakness, this paper
follows convention in ignoring the problems raised by attrition.
(3) The list of variables is not preciselythe same in each equation. This is because of matrix
singularities occasionally generated by the relatively small means of some of the dependent
variables.

(4) These findings are similar to Rees and Shah (1986), who can also identify an age effect.
(5) Few other economists have used the data set. Exceptions include Connolly, Micklewright
and Nickel (1989) and Micklewright (1989).
(6) Although not much can be done about it, one caveat oughtto be recorded. It is possible that
inheritance is a proxy for some other underlying variable. It could be, for example, that
dynamic' parents produce dynamic' children and two of the characteristicsof these
individuals are that they are entrepreneurial
they tend to give financial help to their

ni

children. On this view there would be no case for a policy subsidising entrepreneurship,
because entrepreneurial drive would depend upon genes. However, it is worth remembering
that we have controlled for parental social class when the respondent was eleven (NCDS2),
and for a rangeof individual ability and personality traits. In addition, we experimented with

a large number of social class variables drawn from various s'eeps of the surveys.
