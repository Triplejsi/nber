WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE AND THE DURATION OF WORKPLACE INJURIES

ABSTRACT

This

paper uses a new administrative micro-data set to examine the effect

of a legislated increase in the minimum and maximum workers' compensation

benefit on the duration of workplace injuries in Minnesota. As a result of
legislation, workers in some earnings groups received higher benefits if they
were injured after the effective date of the benefit increase, while workers
in other earnings groups received the same benefit regardless of when they

were injured. The analysis compares the change in mean log

injury duration

for workers who were affected by the benefit increase to that of workers who

were not affected by the benefit increase. The findings indicate that the
duration of injuries increased by 8 percent more for the group of workers that
experienced a 5 percent increase in benefits than for the group of workers

that had no change in their benefit. Additional findings suggest that
employees of self-insured firms who are injured on the job tend to return to
work faster than employees of imperfectly experience rated

firms who incur

similar injuries.

Work-related disabilities are an unfortunate and costly consequence of

production. In a typical year, more than fifty times as many working days are
lost to work injuries as are lost to labor strikes, and from one-half to one-

third as many working days are lost to work injuries as are lost to

unemployinent) The total amount of working time foregone because of
work-related disabilities is the product of the incidence of work-related
injuries and the average duration of time spent away from work once an injury

has occurred.2 This paper examines how workers' compensation insurance and
other factors influence the duration of lost work time that results from workrelated injuries and illnesses.
Workers' compensation insurance is the primary public program for workers

who experience a work-related injury or illness. In recent years, nearly
half of all workers who missed one or more days of work because of a work
injury collected workers' compensation benefits.3 Previous research has
focused on the impact of providing more generous benefits on injured

employees' incentives to return to work. This research is limited, however,
by the difficulty of identifying separate benefit and wage effects because
benefits are typically determined as a function of the worker's pre-disability

wage. Moreover, workers' compensation insurance may also affect employers'
incentives to encourage disabled workers to return to work. In particular,
privately insured firms have little incentive to induce injured workers to
return to work because insurance premiums are often imperfectly experience
rated, while self-insured firms have a stronger incentive because they bear

the full marginal cost of workers' compensation benefits. The effect of
employers' incentives on the duration of workplace injuries has received
little attention in the literature.
In this paper, I use longitudinal data on workers' compensation claims in

2

Minnesota to examine how both

employees' and employers' incentives influence

the duration of nonwork spells

following workplace injuries. The analysis is
based on an unusual natural

experiment that was created by a legislated

in the benefit schedule which raised

the sample period. As a result of

the minimum and maximum benefits

during

this benefit change, identical workers who

qualify for the maximum or minimum benefits would

receive different benefit

injured before or after the date of the

benefit change. On the other hand, workers' who did not receive the maximum
or minimum benefits form a control

group because their benefits were the same

regardless of when they were injured. Unlike

previous studies, this natural

experiment allows one to compare the duration of
the same state who earn the exact

work injuries for workers in

same wage but received different workers'

compensation benefits.

This quasi-experiment is used to address

the following questions: How

employees of firms that purchase insurance from

the relationship between injury

duration and benefits vary between self-insured

and privately insured firms?

The findings indicate that the average duration of temporary total
injuries is extremely responsive to the level of benefits paid. A comparison

of changes in durations before and after a 5 percent increase in the maximum
and minimuj benefits shows that the average duration of claims increased by
about 8 percent more for the group of workers that experienced a benefit

3

increase due to the schedule change than for the group of workers that was

unaffected by the increase in the maximum and minimum benefits. Moreover, the
estimated effect of benefits on the duration of work injuries is qualitatively
different when the natural experiment is ignored and rionlinearities in the

benefit schedule are used to estimate the benefit and wage effects.
In addition, employees of self-insured firms are found to have shorter
spells on workers' compensation than employees of privately insured firms, and
the average duration of injuries is found to be more responsive to the
increase in benefits in imperfectly experience rated firms than in self-

insured firms. These results suggest that employers' insurance incentives
also have an effect on the duration of work injuries.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section I discusses
relevant institutional features of the Minnesota workers' compensation system

and briefly reviews the past literature. Section II presents several
difference-in-differences estimators of the effect of benefits on injury
duration based on the natural experiment created by the revision in the

benefit schedule. Section III presents multivariate estimates of the effect
of benefits on the duration of injuries based on the exogenous variation in

benefits caused by the change in the benefit schedule. Section IV estimates
the injury duration-benefit elasticity for a sample of workers with short-term
injuries, and for separate samples of self-insured and nonself-insured firms.
Section V contrasts estimates of the injury duration-benefit elasticity
identified by the change in the benefit schedule to those identified by

nonlinearities in the benefit schedule. Section VI contains a summary and
conclusion.

A Description of Workers'

Compensation Insurance

Temporary total injuries are the most

common type of claim in the

workers' compensation system. A

temporary total injury is one that renders an
employee completely unable to work for
a finite period of time. Most
injuries
are initially classified as a
temporary total claim. Cases
involving injuries
that result in some form of
permanent impairment are reclassified as either a
permanent partial or permanent total case

Figure 1 displays the schedule that

was used to compute weekly benefits

for temporary total cases in Minnesota in the beginning of l986.
the workers' compensation benefit

In essence,

equals two-thirds of a workers'

Pre-disability weekly wage, subject to a maximum weekly benefit
payment
($342), and a minimum weekly benefit
payment ($171). There is a further
stipulation, however, that workers' whose

minimum benefit be paid their

earnings make them subject to the

weekly wage if their weekly wage is less than

the minimum. Lastly, there is a second minimum ($68.40) that
establishes a
absolute floor for benefits,
even for workers who earn less than the second
minimujn. It can be observed from
Figure 1 that this benefit structure
creates
a "two-tier" minimums in which
workers earning less that $256.50 per week are
paid the first minimum ($171) if their Pre-disabijjty
wage exceeds the first
minimum, exactly their wage if it is between the first minimum and
the
absolute minimum, or the absolute minimum if their
wage is less than this
absolute floor.

compensation benefit.6 In most

temporary total cases, however, Figure 1 represents the

relationship between

past earnings and workers' compensation benefits.

Maximum and minimum benefits are revised each year on October 1 by the
Minnesota legislature to keep pace with past statewide wage growth. The
maximum and minimum benefits are specified

as a certain percentage of the

average weekly wage for the calendar year ending on December 31 of the

preceding year. For example, the maximum benefit

payable is 100 percent of

the statewide average weekly wage. Injuries that occur on or after October 1
are subject to the new benefit schedule, while those

that occurred prior to

October 1. remain subject to the former benefit schedule. The next section

demonstrates how legislated changes in the minimum and maximum benefits can be
used to estimate the impact of benefits on the duration of claims.

Benefits are payable for the duration of the disability in temporary

total cases. However, an employer or insurer may initiate administrative
proceedings to discontinue benefits if it believes that an employee has
recovered from his or her disability but continues to receive workers'

compensation benefits. In Minnesota, an employer may not dismiss an employee
for pursuing a workers' compensation claim.

Most cases are concluded without

6

an administrative proceeding, and in the vast majority of temporary total

cases, employees return to work for their former employer.7
Because workers' compensation insurance reduces the financial burden of
work injuries, many observers have hypothesized that more generous
workers' compensation benefits will lead workers to increase their reservation

wage for returning to work (e.g., Richard Butler and John Worrall, 1985). A
higher reservation wage, in turn, will lead injured workers to prolong their
spell on workers' compensation insurance.

One problem with this argument is that most injured workers return to
their former job at exactly their pvc-disability wage.8 As a consequence,
their reservation wage must be no higher than it was before the injury

occurred. A more plausible explanation for a positive relationship between
benefits and work injuries is that workers experience greater disutility from

work the more quickly they return to work after suffering an injury. For
example, a back injury is likely to cause an employee more pain if he returns

to work after resting one day than after resting one week. In this view,
higher benefits increase average durations by raising workers' reservation
health level, which explains why wages are typically unchanged after spells on
workers' compensation insurance.
Past studies have typically found a positive relationship between the

average duration of workers' compensation spells and the benefit level. For
example, Butler and Worrall (1985) estimate that a 10 percent increase in

benefits is associated with a 3.8 percent increase in the length of temporary
total lower back injury claims using data for Illinois.9 As Ehrenberg (1988)
notes, however, the fact that benefits are a nondecreasing. nonlinear function
of the predisability wage makes it impossible to disentangle the effect of

7

benefits from the effect of wages in a

cross-sectional study of one state's

workers' compensation program. Since workers of

different earnings levels may

have different motivation and attachment to work, the

worker's pre-disability

wage rate may directly influence the length of workers' compensation

spells

and thus confound estimates of the effect of benefits.
Furthermore, a cross-state analysis of the effect of benefits

on duration

is unavoidably hindered by the fact that many relevant institutional factors

besides benefits differ across the states. For example, disabled workers are
required to wait between three and seven days to become

eligible for benefits,

depending on the state. The waiting period will influence the measured
average duration of claims in a state. Similarly, unobserved differences in
the administration of workers' compensation laws are likely to affect the

duration of injuries. Studies of injury duration based on inter-state
variations in benefits, such as John Worrall, Richard

Butler, Philip Borba and

David Durbin (1989) and William Johnson and Jan Ondrich (1989), are unable to
control for all the institutional features of workers'

compensation insurance

that vary across states.

II.

Enrntrical

Evidence on Benefits and Injury Duration: A Natural Experiment

Increases in the minimum and maximum benefits create a natural experiment
that can be used to estimate the effect of

increasing workers' compensation

benefits on the duration of work injury claims. 10

Figure 2 illustrates how

this experiment works. As a result of the legislated, nonretroactjve increase
in the maximum benefit and minimum benefits, individuals whose pre-disability

earnings place them on segments A, C, and E of Figure 1 received a 5 percent
greater weekly benefit if they were injured on or after October 1 than if

were injured before that date. For example, the
$342 to $360 for high-wage earners on October

weekly benefit increased from

1, 1986.11 On the other hand,

workers whose earnings fall into segments B and D form natural control
because their benefit was the same

regardless of when they were injured.

Finally, the small sample of individuals with

groups

earnings in the gray areas

segments are excluded from the analysis because

their benefits increased by an amount between 0 and 5 percent.
If more generous benefits truly induce longer workers' compensation
spells, we should observe longer spell durations for

those in segments A, C

and E who were injured after October 1 than for those with the same earnings
but with injuries pre-dating the October 1

increase. Furthermore, the

experience of individuals in segments B and D allow us to control for any
other changes that might have occurred in this time period. Time-varying
factors that affect the duration of claims

(e.g., possible changes in

administrative procedures) can be differenced out by computing the difference
in the change in average duration between

individuals on segments A, C and E,

and those on segments B and D before and after the benefit change. Moreover,
there are six possible pairings of "treatment"

and "control" groups because of

the two-tier structure of minimums.

claims for injuries that occurred in 1986.12 To eliminate gross errors in the
benefit and wage data, the sample is restricted to individuals whose reported
temporary total benefit is within $10 of the benefit that is calculated from

the applicable benefit schedule and the reported weekly wage. Less than 5
percent of observations were deleted by this criterion.13
The data set includes all claims for temporary total injuries in
Minnesota that originated in 1986 and closed by July 1989; incomplete spells

are truncated. But because an estimated 99 percent of temporary total
workers' compensation claims close in less than three years, the truncation of
incomplete spells does not present a serious problem (Minnesota Department of
Labor and Industry, 1988, P. 29).

Furthermore, in a later specification I

avoid the truncation issue entirely by restricting the sample to short-term
injuries, such as broken fingers and sprained ankles; virtually all of these
injuries would have closed in the sample period.

Table 1 summarizes estimates of the change in duration of temporary total
injuries that occurred before and after the benefit increases for each

earnings category. The table shows a clear pattern. There is a statistically
significant increase in the average duration of temporary total claims after
October 1 for each of the three groups of workers (segment A,C,E of Figure 2)

for which benefits were increased. For example, workers in group E, who
qualified for the maximum benefit, had an average log duration of 1.101 weeks

if they were injured before the benefit increase, and an average log duration

of 1.233 if they were injured after the benefit increase. The difference
between these two numbers, which is reported in Column 3, indicates that the

average duration of claims increased by about 13.2 percent for workers who

received the higher maximum benefit. The average duration of claims increased

by a similar magnitude, 11 percent. for workers at the first minimum, and by
24 percent for the sample of workers at the absolute minimum.
In contrast, workers in the two earnings segments (B and D) that had no

benefit change in spite of the higher maximum and minimums, exhibit no
statistically significant change in their average duration of claims after

October 1st.15 This finding suggests that the observed longer durations for
workers who received the higher benefits would not have occurred in the
absence of the benefit increase.
The average log weekly benefit is reported in Table I to measure the

benefit changes during the sample periods. As noted earlier, benefits
increased by 5 percent for those who receive the maximum or one of the minimum

benefits. However, because the weekly wage is inferred from the First Report
Form and in some cases does not reflect the wage rate that was actually used
to determine benefits (e.g., wages from secondary employment and fringe
benefits are omitted), the benefit does not increase by exactly 5 percent for

individuals in segments A, C, and E. Nonetheless, the measured benefit
increases for the period after October 1 are extremely close to 5 percent for

workers in segments A, C, and E. In addition, the change in the average log
benefit is statistically insignificant and trivial for the groups of workers
in segments B and D, which were not affected by the maximum or minimum benefit

increase. Consequently, workers on segment B and D appear to form valid
control groups.

A difference-in-differences estimate of the elasticity of the average

temporary total duration with respect to benefits ().can be calculated from
the information reported in Table 1 as

benefits. After three months, the hazard rates look about the same for both
groups of workers. Plots of the hazard rate for workers in Segments A and

C,

which are not reported here, show a similar pattern to Figure 3. These
results suggest that benefit increases have a somewhat greater effect on
recipients with relatively short term injuries.
Finally, notice that Table 1 also shows that the average duration of
workers' compensation spells increases with earnings in this sample. For
example, workers with weekly earnings below $68.40 on average have

substantially shorter injury spells than workers who earn in excess of $560

per week. This finding is surprising in view of past cross-sectional studies,
which found that average duration increases with the proportion of lost wages
replaced by workers' compensation benefits, because individuals with low
earnings have a higher replacement rate than individuals with

rates and duration illustrates the difficulty of drawing inferences when there
is not exogenous variation in benefits and wages.
composition of Injuries
An increase in benefits may affect the incidence as well as the duration

of workers' compensation claims. Therefore, the composition of temporary
total injuries may be affected by an increase in the benefit level. A
composition change would result if, for example, the availability of more

generous benefits after a benefit increase encourages some workers with
relatively minor injuries to pursue claims that they would otherwise have

ignored in the absence of a benefit increase. On the other

hand, higher

benefits may induce some workers to take more risks on the job, which may

13

result in more serious injuries.

Table 2 explores the impact of changing benefits on the composition of
workers' compensation claims by estimating the relative frequency of claims
for various types of injuries for workers on the different segments of Figure

2, before and after the benefit increase. The results indicate that the
relative frequency of injuries involving bone fractures increased slightly for
workers who experienced a benefit increase, but was hardly changed for workers

on the segments that were unaffected by the benefit increase. The relative
frequency of fractures after October 1 increased by an average of 3 percent
for workers on segments A, C, and E, while there was a slight decrease in the
relative frequency of cases involving fractures for workers in segments B and

D. On the other hand, there is no discernable difference in the pattern of
changes in the share of cases involving sprains, back injuries, or multiple
injuries for workers in the different benefit segments.

Because of potential compositional changes in workers' compensation
recipients in response to a change in benefits, it is desirable to control for
covariates in estimating the duration response to a benefit increase.

log-linear regression model seems a preferable alternative for estimating the
duration of temporary total claims than making parametric distributional
assumptions to handle truncation.

A fairly general model to explain the duration of injury spells as a
function of benefits and other covariates is:

+

where Ti is the completed spell duration for worker i. The variables denoted
by a capital letter,

B. C or

are dummy variables that indicate the

earnings segment along the horizontal axis of Figure 2 in which each worker is

categorized. For example, if worker i earns less than $68.40 per week, dummy

variable A will equal 1 and the other dummies (B C, D) will equal zero.
These dummy variables are interacted with the log of the weekly wage to allow

for piecewise linear effects of past earnings on injury spells. Parameters
are denoted by greek letters. The coefficient, t, is the elasticity of injury
duration with respect to benefits, which is assumed constant across

individuals. The vector

denotes covariates, including dummies for the type

of injury and insurance arrangement, and

is a random disturbance.

Furthermore, since the benefit level changed for workers in some earnings
groups but not for workers in other groups, equation (1) could also include a

dummy variable, Zj which equals 1 if the worker was injured after the benefit

increase went into effect, and 0 otherwise. Including z, as shown in
equation (2), will net out additive period effects that might be correlated

15

with the change in benefits.

The wage terms in equation (2) are designed to absorb the benefit
schedule at a point in time. Therefore, the variation in benefits due to the
nonlinear benefit schedule has been partialied out. But in Minnesota there is
also idiosyncratic variation in benefits for workers who earn the same wage
because, in some cases, benefits are affected by the payment of fringe
benefits, apprenticeship status, and other factors.

Additionally, the

observed wage variable is measured with some error because it is derived from

the First Report. If equation (2) is estimated by Ordinary Least Squares
(OLS) effect of the benefit is identified by both idiosyncratic variation in

benefits (at the same wage) and by the change in the benefit scheduie)6
Since the idiosyncratic variation in benefits is not necessarily a

legitimate source of variation to use to identify the benefit elasticity, it
is desirable to estimate the benefit elasticity from variations in benefits
that are solely due to the interteniporal change in the benefit schedule. This

is accomplished by estimating equation (2) by Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS),

using dummy variables indicating whether an individual is in segment A.B.C or
D and injured after the benefit change, along with the included variables in

(2), as instruments for the benefit variable. In other

words, equation (2) is

identified by the exclusion restriction of the vector of interactions, (zj.Ai,

z1'B1, z1•C1, zi.Dj). It should be noted that if the legislated benefit

16

change was the only source of linearly independent variations in

benefits,

then estimation of equation (2) by 2SLS and by OLS would be identical.
Estimates

Columns 1 and 2 of Table 3 present OLS estimates of

equation (2), and

Columns 3 and 4 present 2SLS estimates. In both the OLS and 2SLS estimates,
the first equation excludes covariates, and the second equation includes
several covariates

Means and standard deviations of the variables are also

provided in the table.'7
The OLS estimates yield a larger benefit elasticity than the 2SLS

estimates. Moreover, a Hausman test rejects the hypothesis that the OLS

and

2SLS estimates of the benefit elasticity are equal at the .05 level, whether

covariates are included or excluded from the equation. Since the benefit
effect in the 2SLS equation is identified solely by variation created by a
legislative act that could reasonably be taken as exogenous in this case, the
idiosyncratic variation in benefits is not likely to be a legitimate source of

variation to use to identify the benefit elasticity. For this reason, the
2SLS estimate, which relies solely on time-series variation in benefits, is
probably more reliable.

The elasticity estimated by 2SLS without covariates is 1.83 (t—2.ll),
which is similar in magnitude to the difference-in-differences elasticities

presented in Section 2. The addition of covariates slightly reduces the
estimated benefit elasticity in both the OLS and 2SLS estimates, suggesting

that compositional changes are not very significant. The estimated elasticity
of 1.67 in Column 4 implies that a 10 percent increase in benefits would
increase the average duration of temporary total work injuries by one week.

Chi-square over-identification tests are reported at the bottom of the

table to test whether the instruments are orthogonal

to the residual in the

2SLS equations. Although these specification test results suggest that the
model is correctly specified, the results are not compelling in view of the

imprecision of the instrumented coefficient. On the other hand, the

quasi-

experimental nature of the instruments lends some additional support for the
plausibility of the 2SLS estimation strategy.
The coefficients on the wage terms indicate that the
has a complicated, nonlinear effect on injury duration.

pre-disability wage

Within most of the

earnings brackets, the duration decreases with the wage rate, as evidenced

by

the negative coefficients on the wage-earnings segment interactions. It
should also be noted that the dummy for injuries occurring after October 1 is
statistically insignificant, suggesting that period effects are unimportant.
The estimated coefficients for the remaining covariates are very similar

in the OLS and 2SLS models. The point estimates indicate that

the duration of

temporary total spells is about 10 percent shorter in self-insured firms than
in privately insured firms (the omitted dummy variable), and that the duration
of spells is about 15 percent shorter in firms insured by the Minnesota State

Fund than by a private insurance carrier. Moreover, the difference in the
duration between self-insured firms and the State Fund is not statistically

significant. The spell length is longest at firms covered by the Minnesota
Assigned Risk Pool, which only accepts firms with inferior safety records.
A discussed in more detail below, a possible explanation for the shorter
injury duration at self-insured firms than privately insured firms is that
self-insured employers bear the full marginal cost of benefits, while
insurance premiums are only partially adjusted accident costs at privately

insured firms. This financial arrangement provides self-insured firms with

a

18

strong incentive relative to privately insured firms
to encourage workers to

return to work quickly after an injury. On the

shorter injury spells than

women, white collar workers have shorter injury spells than

blue collar

workers, and younger workers have shorter injury spells than older workers.
Interestingly, being married tends to extend the length of time on workers'
compensation insurance for women, but has no effect for men. Employees who
work in larger establishments return to work after injuries faster than
employees in smaller establishments, perhaps due to the fact that it is easier
to facilitate injured workers in large establishments.'8

Larger

establishments are also more likely to be experience rated.
Several injury characteristic dummy variables are included in the
equations estimated in Columns 2 and 4 but not reported in the table. To
summarize their effects, the results indicate that injuries

involving an

amputation, nervous disorder, hernia, or heart ailment, and injuries to the
back and to multiple body parts have relatively long spell durations. On the
other hand, scratches, cuts, contusions, and injuries to the lower extremities
have relatively short spell durations.

IV.

Estimates

for Selected Subspmples

A. Short-Term Injuries
Table 4 presents 2SLS estimates of injury duration equations including

covariates for several different samples. For convenience, Column 1
replicates the estimates for the full sample. Column 2 presents an estimate

19

of the same equation for the subset of workers with injuries that on average

close in less than 10 weeks. The sample of short-term injuries includes such
injuries as lacerations, scratches, and poison ivy infections.'9 The purpose
of presenting results for the sample of workers with short-term injuries is

twofold. First, it is likely that none of the spell durations for these types
of injuries is truncated. Second, it is useful to know whether the duration
of short-term injuries is relatively more responsive to changes in benefits.

The results for the sample of workers with short-term injuries are

similar to those for the overall sample. The effect of benefits on injury
duration is slightly greater in the sample of short-term injuries than in the

full sample. The difference in the benefit elasticities, however, is not
statistically significant. In addition, the effect of the covariates is
similar in the sample of short-term injuries and in the full sample. These
results suggest that, as expected, truncation of very long-term injuries in
this sample has little effect on the estimates.

B. Form of Insurance
In Minnesota, employers can satisfy their workers' compensation insurance

requirement by purchasing insurance from a private insurance carrier or from

the competitive state insurance fund, or by self-insuring. Permission to
self-insure is typically only granted to large, financially solvent firms.2°
Employers who are unable to provide insurance through other means may be
eligible for coverage by the Minnesota State Assigned Risk Pool, which insures

high-risk firms. Privately insured firms account for approximately 70 percent
of injuries, and self-insured firms account for nearly 20 percent of injuries.
The Minnesota Competitive State Fund is relatively new and quite small,

handling just 3 percent of injuries that occur in the state. The alternative

insurance arrangements provide different incentives for firms to invest
resources in accident prevention and to rehabilitate

disabled employees.

In the event of a work-related injury, self-insured
provide the same level of workers' compensation benefits
insured through private carriers or the state.

firms are required to

as firms that are

Self-insurers must maintain a

security account with a balance of at least 110 percent of their

expected

annual workers' compensation costs. The firm's subsequent Workers'
compensation losses are drawn from this account. As a result,

self-insurers

bear the full marginal cost of injuries.

In contrast, insurance premiums for firms covered by the state fund,
private carriers, or the Assigned Risk Pool are imperfectly modified to

reflect an employer's past loss experience. Insurance premiums are typically
determined by a weighted average of the firm's last three year's accident
experience and the average accident experience in the firm's industry.
Greater weight is placed on the firm's past insurance losses for larger firms.
At one extreme, very small firms are "manual rated," which means they are
charged the insurance rate for their industry listed in the state's rating

manual regardless of their actual experience. For very large firms, most or
all of the weight is placed on the firm's own experience. Louise Russel
(1973) estimates that more than 80 percent of employees work in firms that

are

not fully experience rated for their workers' compensation costs.
Moreover, even in fully experience-rated firms, the typical experiencerating formula places greater emphasis on the incidence of past workers'

compensation claims than on the severity (i.e., duration x average benefit) of

injuries in determining experience-rating offset. This practice, known as
"loss limitations," is accomplished by discounting the amount of losses

21

incurred for claimS that cost more than $2,000, and by capping the maximum

loss for a claim. The severity of injuries is given little weight in
experience rating modifications because the conventional view in the insurance
industry is that the duration of work injuries is beyond the employers'
control (National Council on Compensation Insurance, 1982).

There are several ways, however, in which an employer might be able to

affect the duration of an employee's workers' compensation claim. First, an
employer could modify a disabled employee's work environment to accommodate

his or her disability. Second, an employer could arrange for a temporarily
disabled employee to perform alternate job tasks until he or she is fully

recovered. Third, an employer could have an employee initially return to work
on a part-time basis. Fourth, an employer could apply pressure on the
employee to rapidly return to work. Finally, an employer might file for a
discontinuance of benefits or challenge a claim if it is believed that a
beneficiary is malingering.

A comparison of the duration of temporary total claims in self-insured
and nonseif-insured firms provides a test of whether firms' incentives
influence the amount of work time their employees lose after a workplace

injury. Because self-insured firms directly bear a greater share of the
marginal cost of providing workers' compensation benefits to employees, these
firms have a greater incentive to induce their workers to quickly return to

work. The regression results in Table 3 indicate that self-insured firms have
about a 10% shorter average injury duration than privately insured firms.21
Moreover, in results not reported here, self-insured firms were found to have
shorter injury durations than privately insured firms in a variety of
homogeneous injuries, including hernias, broken fingers, and sprained ankles.

imprecise) and statistically insignificant for self-insured firms. These
results provide some support for the view that the effect of
generous benefits on employees' injury spells is

providing more

tempered if employers' have a

stronger incentive to have workers return to work.

V. Estimates Identified by Nonhinearities in the Benefit Schedule
In the absence of experimental data

on benefit changes, it has been

common for researchers to estimate the effect of social insurance benefits
(which are a nonlinear function of wages)

by restricting the functional form

of wages. In the context of equation 2, this

is equivalent to assuming that

the piecewise log linear wage terms should be excluded from the equation.
Although this restriction is overwhelmingly rejected
3, it is natural to question how sensitive the

by the estimates in Table

estimates would be to

functional form restrictions of this type.

Table 5 presents several OLS injury duration regressions that are
identified by restricting the functional form of the wage term.22 Variations
in the benefit variable in these specifications are primarily due to

nonhinearities in the benefit formula. These estimates are meant to provide a
comparison to the specifications previously estimated in the literature (e.g.,

Butler and Jorrall, 1985). In general, this exercise shows that the benefit
elasticity is remarkably sensitive to alternative identifying assumptions

based on functional form.
The log of the benefit and the log of the wage are entered as separate

regressors in the first three columns of Table 5. In these specifications,
the benefit has a small but statistically significant, positive effect on the
duration of claims, and the wage has a statistically insignificant, negative

effect on claim duration. The magnitude of the benefit elasticity is close to
Butler and Worrall's (1985) Weibull model estimate for Illinois, but

substantially smaller than that implied by the natural experiment studied
here.
Columns 4.6 of Table 5 enter the log of the replacement rate (weekly
benefit divided by weekly wage) in place of the separate wage and benefit

variables. This specification constrains the benefit and wage to have equal
but opposite signed effects, which imposes a more restrictive functional form

assumption than Columns 1-3. This modification in the specification yields a
strikingly different result: A higher ratio of the benefit to the wage is
associated with a shorter duration of time spent on workers' compensation
insurance. Given that the benefit and wage have opposite signs in Columns
1-3, the negative effect of the replacement rate is counterintuitive.

The dramatic difference between the two different specifications in
Table 5 can be traced to the strong multicolinearity between the benefit and

wage variables. To see this, denote B as the benefit and W as the wage, and
let b1 equal the benefit coefficient and b2 the wage coefficient in the

specification in Columns 1-3. Using the omitted-variable formula, the
coefficient on the log replacement rate, a1, in the restrictive specification
estimated in Columns 4-6 can be decomposed as:

24

a1 — b1

(b1

The

relatively low because benefits are

nearly a linear transformation of wages. Moreover, the

replacement rate

declines sharply with wages, which leads to the large negative covariance
between the two variables.

Lastly, it should be noted that the estimated negative effect of the
replacement rate on spell durations is not entirely surprising in light of the
cross-sectional relationship between wages and mean spell duration discussed

in regards to Table 1. Higher paid workers tend to have a lower replacement
rate and a longer injury duration, on average. Moreover, the fact that the
effect of the replacement rate on nonwork spells is only one-third as large in

magnitude in Column 6 as in Column 4 suggests that the variables

measuring the

workers' occupation, extent of injury, and demographic characteristics can
account for a large portion of the negative effect of the replacement rate.
This finding may result because, other things equal, high-pay workers have
more dangerous jobs, or because high-pay workers are less likely to pursue
claims for minor injuries.

The qualitatively different estimates of the effect of benefits on
duration in the two specifications in Table 5 exemplify how incorrect
inference can be drawn about the effect of social programs when nonlinearities
in replacement rate formulas generate the main source of variations in
benefits and wages.

VI. Summary and Conclusion
This paper has explored the effect of the workers' compensation insurance

system on the duration of workplace injuries. The analysis focuses on a
natural experiment that increased benefits for some workers, but left benefits

unchanged for other workers. This natural experiment is used to estimated the
effect of providing more generous benefits on the duration of work injuries.

In addition, incentive effects for employers' to facilitate and expedite their
employees' return to work are also considered.

In a period when benefits were increased by 5 percent for workers who
qualify for the minimum or maximum workers' compensation benefit, the average

duration ofan injury spell was found to have increased by 8 percent for the
group of workers that received the higher minimum or maximum, but was
virtually unchanged for workers who were unaffected by the benefit change.
Moreover, the benefit response tends to be greater for workers who have short-

term injuries. Although it is unlikely that these findings could have
occurred by chance, one might be skeptical of the magnitude of the estimated
impact of benefits on the duration of claims in this natural experiment

because it is much larger than previously published estimates of the benefitinjury duration elasticity.

One

explanation

for the larger estimated effect of benefits in this study

than in previous analyses of workers' compensation is that the variation in
benefits is genuinely exogenous in the data considered here, whereas
identification of independent benefit and wage effects is problematic in the

past literature. Support for this interpretation comes from a recent paper by
Bruce Meyer, Kip Viscusi and David Durbin (1989), which examines changes in
the median injury duration associated with large changes in the maximum

26

benefit in two states. Although Meyer, Viscusi

and Durbin's results are not

directly comparable because they focus on the median spell length, the implied
elasticities in their two states are also

substantially larger than those

found in the past literature. Together, these

longitudinal analyses of

benefit changes should move even a hardened skeptic in the direction of
believing that the duration of work injuries is responsive to the

amount of

workers' compensation benefits that are paid.

Other estimates in the paper document that self-insurance is associated
with shorter injury spells than (imperfectly experience rated) private

insurance. Moreover, an increase in workers' compensation benefits has a
positive effect on injury duration in the sample of firms that purchase
insurance from private carriers or from the state fund, but has

a

statistically insignificant effect in the sample of self-insured firms. These
results provide the first evidence that employers' incentives may have an
important influence on the duration of employees' injuries.

Clearly,

additional evidence on this issue would be useful.

The empirical results presented here suggest that there are two effective
levers available in workers' compensation insurance to influence the

duration

of working time lost due to workplace injuries. The first lever is by
changing the amount of indemnity benefits provided to workers who are injured
on the job; and the second lever is by strengthening the link between
employer's insurance costs and the actual cost of providing injury benefits to
their employees.

Notes

1. In 1986, for example, 2.63 percent of working time was lost due to
occupational injuries and illnesses, .05 percent of work days were idled due
to work stoppages involving 1,000 or more employees, and 7.9 percent of labor
force time was lost due to unemployment (see Tables 647, 679, and 681 of U.S.

Bureau of the Census, 1989). For expediency, I will use the term work injury
broadly throughout the paper, including both physical injuries and illnesses.

2. See Ronald Ehrenberg (1988) and Alan Krueger (1990) for recent surveys
of the determinants of the incidence of work-related injuries.

3. This figure is based on the author's calculations of the nationwide
workers' compensation recipiency rate using the March 1988 Current Population
Survey and on the Occupational Safety Health Administration's survey of all
lost-work time accidents.

4. See Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry (1988), Chapter 2 and 5.
Because most workers return to work immediately when their temporary total

spell ends, the terms duration of temporary total case and time away from work
will be used interchangeably.

5. Only 13 percent of workers' compensation recipients in Minnesota receive
disability compensation from their employer, and only 3 percent receive other
government support, such as unemployment insurance, medicare, or foodstamps,
during their disability, so little is lost by focusing solely on workers'
compensation benefits (Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry, p. 74).

6, There are some additional, less common exceptions to the benefit-wage

relationship in Figure 1. For example, benefits for volunteer workers are
based on the prevailing wage for that type of job, and benefits for employees
who work irregular hours are based on a five day work week if they work fewer

30

than five days per week.

10. Kathleen Classen (1979)

and Bruce Meyer (1989)

similarly examine

increases in the maxjmtim

unemployment insurance benefit to estimate the effect
of benefit changes on the duration
of unemployment spells. In related work,
Gary Solon (1985) uses a change in the tax status of unemployment
insurance
benefits to examine the effect of
after-tax benefits on
unemployment spells.
11. The inflation rate
(CPI-Urban) was only 1.1% in 1986, so these benefit
changes represent approximately real changes in transfer payments.

12. If a claim is initially classified
as a temporary total case, but
reclassified as a permanent partial
improvement, the length of time on

case upon the date of maximun medical

complete data who earned less than $5,000 per week.

31

14. Under the null hypothesis that benefits are unrelated to duration, the
truncation of benefits does not lead to biased estimates. Furthermore, if
higher benefits cause the distribution of spells to shift to the right, righthand truncation will lead to an underestimate of the benefit elasticity.

15. The same pattern holds for the median injury duration.
16. Note, however, that the effect of measurement error and idiosyncratic
variations in benefits should be limited because the sample was restricted to
workers whose benefit was within $10 of the benefit based on the schedule.

17. To compare the age and marital status of the workers' compensation
claimants to the overall workforce, I have estimated the age distribution and
marital rate for the sample of Minnesota workers contained in the 1987 Current

Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group Sample. The sample of workers'
compensation recipients is slightly younger than the general workforce, and
about equally likely to be married.

18. The establishment size variable was merged to the data set by the author
on the basis of the firm's Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code.
Specifically, the average number of employees per establishment in an industry
was derived from the 1986 County Business Patterns survey of Minnesota (US
Department of Commerce, 1987). and then matchsd to each claimant on the basis

of its firm's four-digit SIC. If average firm sizs at the four-digit level
was not availabis in County Business Patterns, th. three-digit industry level

was used, and so on. Because government employment is excluded from County
Business patterns, it was assumed that th. average establishment size is 1,000
for stats government. 1,000 for the executive branch, and 50 for local governments

32

19. For this analysis, injuries

are defined in terms of

three.digjt nature of
injury-part of body cells. For example, a broken toe is considered
separate
from a broken arm. There are 357
injury-classes in the sample that have an
average duration of less than 10 weeks. A
complete listing of these injuries

is available on request from the author.

20. A firm must receive permission from
to self-insure. Although the selection

the Minnesota Department of Commerce
criteria the Department uses to

determine eligibility are complicated,

permission is typically only granted to
financially solvent firms with a net worth of at least two million dollars.
Examples of self-insured firms in Minnesota include

Nabisco (see Minnesota Department of Labor

VS Steel, Amoco and

and Industry, 1989). Self.

insurance may also be granted to groups of employers.

21. Because the state fund utilizes the

same experience rating formula as

private insurance carriers, it is unclear
fund have a shorter duration than

why injuries covered by the state

injuries covered by private insurance

carriers. A possible explanation for this finding is that the state fund
screens out firms with particularly severe

injuries. Alternatively, the state

fund may be more successful in providing rehabilitation for disabled workers.

22. The covarjates in these specifications are the same as those in Table 3,
