MACROECONOMIC CONVERGENCE: INTERNATIONAL
TRANSMISSION OF GROWTH AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS
ABSTRACT
This paper uses data for nineteen industrial countries over the
period 1960-1985 to examine the evidence for international convergence
of technical progress. Several models of convergence, including a model
in which convergence is affected by changes in a country's openness to
trade, are evaluated against competing alternatives. We also assess the
extent to which convergence depends on some key measurement
