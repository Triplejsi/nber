RATIONAL ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR AND CIGARETTE SKOKINC

ABSTRACT

After

a discussion of cigarette smoking in the context of the Becker-

Murphy (1988) model of rational addictive behavior, demand equations are

derived accounting for the tolerance, reinforcement, and withdrawal
characteristic of addictive consumption. These are contrasted to equations
developed under the competing hypotheses that smoking is not addictive or
that cigarettes are addictive but individuals behave myopically. The demand

equations are estimated using adults interviewed as part of the Second

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
assumptions that cigarette smoking is an addictive behavior and that individuals do not behave myopically. Long run price elasticities of demand,

These estimates suggest that
increased excise taxation would be an effective way of reducing cigarette
smoking. Estimates for samples of current and ever smokers indicate that

fall in the range from —0.38 to —0.27.

price increases would lead to lower cigarette consumption among both groups.
Finally, the Becker—Murphy model's implications concerning the rate of tine
preference and addictive consumption are tested by estimating the demand for
cigarettes separately using samples based on age or education. Less educated

and younger individuals are found to behave much more myopically than their

more educated or older counterparts. Additionally, more addicted (myopic)
individuals are found to be more responsive, in the long run, to changes in
price than less addicted (myopic) individuals.

Introduction

Until recently, economists have treated consumption of
addictive goods no differently from consumption of other goods even

though other social and physical scientists have long recognized
that addictive goods possess several characteristics distinguishing

One reason for ignoring these

them from most consumer goods.

aspects of consumption was that addiction was considered an
irrational behavior not conducive to standard economic analysis.1

Because of this, many think that addictive consumption does not
follow the basic law of economics, that of an inverse relationship

between the 'price' of a good and its consumption.2 Thus, the
argument has been made that policies such as stronger enforcement

of drug laws, higher fines and longer imprisonment for drug use,
higher taxes on alcohol and cigarettes, and the dissemination of

information concerning the negative health effects of drugs,
alcohol, and tobacco will have little, if any, effect on consumption.

Recently, economists have modeled addictive consumption as a

rational behavior.3 These models capture the distinction between
addictive consumption and other consumption by recognizing that,
for addictive goods, current consumption depends on the level of

but also such factors as negative health effects and legal
sanctions associated with consumption.

past consumption. This time dependence of consumption incorporates

the notions of tolerance, reinforcement, and withdrawal charac-

teristic of addictive consumption.' Tolerance suggests that a
given level of consumption leads to less satisfaction as past
consumption of the addictive good is higher. Reinforcement implies
a learned response to past consumption, and can be either positive
or negative.

Finally, withdrawal refers to a negative physical

reaction and other reductions in utility associated with the
cessation of consumption.

This paper uses the Becker-Murphy (1988) model of rational
addiction to derive and estimate cigarette demand equations which

explicitly take account of the addictive nature of cigarette
smoking.

Cigarette smoking is ideal for empirically testing the
rational addiction model.

Cigarettes, due to the nicotine

contained in them, are an addictive good, with cigarette smoking
the most widespread addictive behavior in today's society.5 Due to

the high incidence of cigarette smoking and its legality, self-

reported measures of smoking should be much more reliable than
measures of heroin or other drug use. Similarly, data on prices

of illegal drugs are likely to be inaccurate, while data on
cigarette prices and taxes are very well reported at the state and

'See, for example, Donegan, et al. (1983), and Peele (1985).

The Surgeon General (USDHHS 1988) describes the processes

leading to tobacco addiction as similar to those determining
addictions to drugs such as heroin and cocaine.

The Surgeon General calls cigarette smoking the "largest
single preventable cause of premature death and disability in the

United States," responsible for over 390,000 premature deaths
annually (USDHHS 1989). Additionally, nonsmokers face a greater
risk of cancer from involuntary smoking than they do from all other

air pollutants (USDHHS 1986). Thus, understanding the effects of
efforts to reduce cigarette smoking is of considerable importance.
Since the release of the first Surgeon General's report on the

health consequences of cigarette smoking, the Federal and various

state and local governments have been involved in a concerted
effort to discourage cigarette smoking.6 One policy which has been
virtually ignored by the Federal government and all but a few state

and local governments is the increased taxation of cigarettes,
which, by raising the price of cigarettes, would reduce smoking.7

6 This effort includes the restrictions placed o. cigarette
advertising by both state and Federal governments, requiring health
warning labels on cigarette packages and advertising, and limiting
smoking in various public places. See the twenty-fifth anniversary
edition of the Surgeon General's Report for a detailed review of
these activities.

Warner (1981) attributes the large number of state excise
tax rate increases after the release of the first Surgeon General's
report to states attempting to discourage smoking by raising price.
These tax increases led to large differences in cigarette prices
Due to the casual and organized smuggling of
across states.
cigarettes from high tax localities to low tax localities, induced
by these disparities, states became reluctant to use excise taxes

to reduce smoking.

The Federal excise tax on cigarettes was

constant at 8 cents per pack from 1951 until January 1, 1983, when
it was doubled as part of a deficit reduction act. While many have
suggested using increased Federal tax rates as a means of reducing
smoking, this has never occured.

This paper is the first to empirically test the predictions
of the Becker-Murphy model of rational addiction using micro data.

As such, it contains the first estimates of the price elasticity
of demand for cigarettes based on individual data, and offers an

interesting comparison to the estimates obtained from state
aggregates by Becker, Grossman, and Murphy (1988).

Due to the

nature of the data, the Becker-Murphy predictions about time
preference and addiction are also tested.

Theoretical Model

Recent economic models of habitual behavior can be divided
into distinct classes based on their approaches to two key factors.

The first distinction comes from the treatment of tastes as either

endogenous or constant over the life cycle.

Endogenous tastes

models incorporate addiction by making present tastes dependent on

past consumption.8 Alternatively, models with constant tastes,
developed in the framework of household production theory, embody

the addictive nature of consumption by letting the ability to
produce the addictive commodity (using the addictive good) depend
on past consumption.9

The second key distinction concerns the rationality of the

See Gorman (1967), von Weizsãcker (1971), Pollak (1970,
1976, 1978), Hammond (1976a, 1976b), and El—Safty (1976a, 1976b).

This type of model was first used by Stigler and Becker
(1977) and is the basis of the work by Leonard (1985, 1986),
lannaccone (1986), Michaels (1988), and Becker and Murphy (1988).
See lannaccone (1984) for an application of this type of model to
religious participation.

addict. Some treat the addict as behaving myopically.'0 That is,
the addict takes into account the dependence of current addictive

consumption on past consumption but ignores the dependence of
future consumption on current and past consumption when making
current consumption decisions. Others choose to treat the addict
as fully rational.11 In these models, the addict is assumed to be
aware of and account for the interdependence of past, current, and

future consumption when making current consumption decisions. The

first of these distinctions has been called "purely semantic"12
since the resulting mathematics is the same.

Similarly, Phlips

(1983) and Phlips and Spinnewyn (1982) show that, in some cases,
myopic models of habit formation and their farsighted counterparts

are "observationally equivalent." Thus, treating the addict as
fully rational only leads to unnecessary complications.

This

observational equivalence does not, however, hold in the BeckerMurphy model.

In the Becker—Murphy model of rational addiction, tastes are

constant and the individual is assumed to be fully rational.13
While assuming complete rationality appears strong, it seems more

consistent than the assumption underlying the myopic models. In
these models, individuals are assumed to be aware of the dependence
of current consumption on past consumption but ignore the resulting
dependence of future consumption on current consumption when making

current decisions.
At any moment in time, the individual's utility is assumed to

be a function of three factors, H, R, and Z.
(1)

U(t) =

u[H(t),

R(t), Z(t)].

H(t) is the individual's health at time t, R(t), for lack of a
better word, is the "relaxation" produced by the consumption of the

addictive commodity at time t, and Z(t) is a vector of other
consumption commodities.

The assumption is made that u is a

concave function and has negative second derivatives with respect
to each of the arguments:
(2)

Uj > 0,

and

i = H, R, Z.

< 0,

The arguments in the utility function are produced as follows:

(3) H(t)= H[M(t),A(t)3, with HM> 0, H< 0, H< 0, and H< 0,
(4) R(t)= R(C(t), A(t)), with Re > 0, Rcc < 0, RA < 0, R < 0,
and RCA > 0
and:
(5)

Z(t) =

Z(X(tfl,

with Z > 0, and Z < 0.

H(t), is assumed to be a function of market goods, such as medical

care, and the individual's own time, spent, for example, on

exercise, denoted by the vector M(t), which enter into the

6

production of health. These inputs have positive but diminishing
effects on health. Health at time t is also affected by the level

of the addictive stock at time t, A(t). The greater the level of
the addictive stock (the larger the degree of addiction), the lower

the level of health, all else constant.14

"Relaxation" is produced by the consumption of the addictive
good cigarettes, C(t), and the addictive stock. Relaxation can be

thought of as the physiological and psychological benefits
resulting from the consumption of the addictive substance.15
Increased cigarette consumption has a positive effect on the
production of relaxation. Greater past consumption, however, is
assumed to have a negative effect on the production of relaxation.

This assumption incorporates the notion of tolerance into the
model.

To capture reinforcement effects in consumption, the

marginal productivity of cigarette consumption at time t in the
production of relaxation is assumed larger the larger the level of
the addictive stock at time t.

The vector of consumption goods, Z(t), is produced using

14 This assumption is reasonable given the extensive body of
research summarized in the twenty-fifth anniversary edition of the

Surgeon General's Report on the Health Consequences of Smoking

(USDHHS 1989).
cigarette smoking, heart disease, respiratory diseases, cancers,
and other illnesses.
15 For example, Ashton and Stepney (1982) include in the short

term psychological and physiological effects of smoking the
maintenance of performance levels in the face of fatigue and the
attenuation of the effects of stress. They go on to suggest that
smokers use smoking as a convenient way of 'manipulating their
psychological state', i.e. a person will smoke to reduce boredom
or tension.
7

inputs X(t), which include market goods and the individual's own

time. All inputs are assumed to have positive but diminishing
marginal productivity in the production of Z.

Based on these assumptions, a derived instantaneous utility
function is obtained as:
(6)

U(t) =

U[C(t),

A(t), Y(t)],

where C and A are as above, and Y(t) is a vector including all
inputs into the production of consumption goods and health.
At any time t, the following will be true:

(7)-(lO) can be used to reillustrate the three charac-

teristics of addictive consumption.

(7) illustrates withdrawal,

since total utility falls if cigarette consumption is reduced.

Tolerance is captured by the negative marginal utility of the
addictive stock shown in (8), which shows that the greater the
level of past consumption, the lower the current level of utility,

ceteris paribus.

Finally, reinforcement is shown by (10) which

states that the marginal utility of current consumption is larger
the larger the level of past consumption, or that past consumption
reinforces current consumption.

8

Following Becker and Murphy, a simple investment function for

the addictive stock is specified as:

A(t) =

(12)

C(t)

—

6A(t),

where 6 is the constant rate of depreciation of the addictive stock

over time. Cigarette consumption at time t, can be thought of as
gross investment in the addictive stock.
Assuming a time additive utility function, a constant rate of
time preference, a, and an infinite lifetime, the lifetime utility
function is:

U =

(13)

et

U(C(t), A(t), 1(t)) dt.

Rational behavior implies maximization of this function subject to
a lifetime budget constraint. Ignoring the allocation of time over

the life—cycle, treating 1(t) as a composite good whose price,
Py(t), is the numeraire, and assuming perfect capital markets, the

appropriate budget constraint is:

j et(Y(t) + Pc(t)C(t)] dt R(O),

(14)

where Pc(t) is the money price of cigarettes at time t, r is the
market interest rate (assumed constant), and R(O) is the discounted

value of lifetime income and assets.

Maximizing (13) subject to (12), (14), and an initial stock
condition yields the following first order conditions:
(15)

U1(t) =

(16)

Uc(t) =

and:

where:

7rc(t) can be thought of as the full price of the addictive good,

and consists of two parts: the money price, Pc(t), appropriately

discounted, and the discounted future utility costs of the
addictive stock..

Several points are worth noting at this time.

Since UA(t) is negative at all t, the full price of the consumption

of the addictive good will be greater than its money price. It is

also clear that the shadow price of the addictive stock will be
affected by both the exogenous rate of depreciation on the stock,
45, and by the rate of time preference, a, all else constant. The
larger the rate of depreciation, the lower the shadow price of the

stock, resulting in an increase in consumption.

Similarly, the

greater the rate of time preference, the lower the full price of

the addictive good, cigarettes, and, therefore, the greater its
consumption. It should also be noted that the shadow price of the
stock is rising as the level of the stock increases, since U < 0.

EmPirical Framework

Following Becker and Murphy (1988) and Becker, Grossman, and
Murphy (1988), a quadratic utility function in the three arguments,

Y(t), C(t), and ACt) is assumed. The assumption is also made that

the individual's rate of time preference is equal to the market

rate of interest (that is, a=r).
utility function is:

Maximizing out with respect to Y(t), converting to discrete
time, and using the resulting first order conditions for C(t) and

A(t), the following demand equations are derived (for a detailed
derivation, see the mathematical appendix):

In both demand equations, current consumption is predicted to

be negatively related to the current price of cigarettes, but
positively related to both past (when included) and future prices.

Similarly, current consumption, if the good is addictive, is
expected to be positively related to future consumption.

When

lagged consumption is included, current consumption is predicted

to be positively related to lagged consumption. In the equation
containing the addictive stock, no prediction can be made concern-

ing the direction of the relationship between it and current
consumption.16

Finally, it should be noted that these demand

equations hold the marginal utility of wealth constant.

The differences between these demand equations and demand

equations estimated by those who choose to either ignore the
addictive nature of cigarette smoking or who treat the smoker as

myopic should be mentioned. In models where there is no attempt

to incorporate the addictive aspects of cigarette consumption,

current cigarette consumption is assumed to be a function of
current price alone, in addition to exogenous factors influencing
demand. All future and past effects are ignored. In myopic models
of cigarette demand (for example, Mullahy 1985), current demand is

a function of current price as well as some measure of past
consumption. Myopic demand equations can be obtained within the
above framework by assuming a-co. Mullahy estimates a version of
equation (20) in which, due to the myopic treatment of the smoker,

and Ø, the coefficients on the future price of cigarettes and

future cigarette consumption respectively, are zero. Similarly,
a myopic version of equation (19), which omits future consumption

and future price, can be derived. This suggests that the

addictive behavior but individuals behave myopically, past
consumption and prices (or the addictive stock) should exert some
positive influence on current consumption, but future consumption

and prices should have no effect. The estimates obtained from
Mullahy's myopic model of cigarette smoking support the hypothesis
that cigarette smoking is an addictive behavior. Becker, Grossman,

and Murphy's (1988) application of Becker and Murphy's rational
addiction model to a pooled data set of the states of the U.S. over
time supports the hypothesis that cigarette smoking is an addictive

behavior and finds some evidence that individuals behave rational-

ly. The estimates presented below, the first to test the rational

addiction model using micro-data, will offer an interesting
comparison to those presented by Becker, Grossman, and Murphy.

Data

The data employed in the estimation of the cigarette demand

equations come from the Second National Health and Nutrition

This is a national survey of

Examination Survey (NHANES2).

approximately 28,000 people ages 6 months to 74 years conducted

from 1976 to 1980 by the National Center for Health Services
Research.

Population groups thought to be at high risk from

malnutrition — low—income persons, preschool children, and the

elderly — were oversainpied.

Individuals were selected from 64

primary sampling units, each of which consisted of at least one
county. Each individual completed detailed questionnaires on their

health histories and most underwent a comprehensive physical
13

examination.

Information on the individual's dietary patterns,

including alcohol and cigarette consumption, was also collected.

Based on an individual's county and state of residence,
cigarette prices and excise taxes were added to the data set.17 The

cigarette price is a weighted average statewide price for a pack
of twenty cigarettes based on the prices of single packs, cartons,

and vending machines sales, inclusive of state sales taxes, where

the weights are the national proportions of each type of sale.
Several one year lags and leads of prices and taxes were added to

the data set under the assumption that the individuals' counties
of residence did not change.

Substantial differences in cigarette prices exist across
states due primarily to the differences in state excise tax rates
on cigarettes, creating an incentive for smokers residing in a high
tax localities to purchase cigarettes in a low tax locality.18 This

17 State level cigarette prices as of November 1 are published
annually by the Tobacco Institute. Additionally, state excise tax
rates on cigarettes and dates of any changes are reported. Using
these data, a monthly price series exclusive of state excise tax

rates was created assuming a linear rate of change. The state
excise tax rate as of the first of each month was then added back

underwent a physical examination are assigned the monthly price
closest to the date of their examination. Individuals who did not
undergo an examination are assigned the price at the midpoint of
the sample date, a three to five week period, for the sampling unit
in which they resided.

18 A second potential endogeneity problem is that heavier
smokers may purchase cigarettes in cartons (lowest price form)
rather than in single packs or through vending machines. Given
available data, little can be done about this problem.
14

incentive depends on the price difference and the costs of
purchasing and transporting the cigarettes from one area to
another, and increases the closer an individual lives to a lower
price locality.

Failing to account for this border crossing

phenomenon would result in estimated price coefficients biased
towards zero.19

To capture this casual smuggling, a weighted

average of the "border price" and the local price of cigarettes,

is used for cigarette price. The weights are (.5, .5) and the
border price is the lowest price for a pack of cigarettes within

twenty-five miles of the county in which the individual resides
(the same as own-price for approximately half of the sample) 2O All

prices and taxes are deflated by the appropriate national monthly
Consumer Price Index and a local price index.21

The dependent variable in the estimated demand equations is
the average number of cigarettes smoked per day. Each equation has

current cigarette consumption as a function of current price,

19 See Chaloupka (1988), Mullahy (1985), Lewit and Coate
(1982), or Lewit, Coate and Grossman (1981) for a lengthier
discussion of the problems introduced by border crossing, as well
as several alternative methods for handling this problem.

20 All equations presented below have been estimated using
several alternative measures of price, including own—price, border-

price, and several other weighted averages of price. The use of

own— or border—price is likely to overstate or understate,
respectively, the true price of cigarettes the individual faces,
leading to biased estimates. The use of alternative weights leads
to minor differences in the results with those prices giving more
weight to the border-price generally performing slightly better.
See Chaloupka (1988) for these results.

future price, future consumption, and either lagged consumption and

price or the addictive stock. To estimate demand equation (19),
consumption in three consecutive periods is required, but only two

consecutive periods are provided in the survey data.22

The

following strategy to approximate consumption in the third period

is employed in the estimation of demand equation (19). Reported
current consumption C(t) is treated as future consumption C*(t+l)

and reported lagged consumption C(t-l) is treated as current
consumption C*(t). What is now required is an estimate of C*(t_1),

or what is actually C(t-2).

For individuals who never smoked,

C*(t_1) is equal to zero. Similarly, for individuals who either

began smoking less than two years prior to their interview or
stopped smoking two or more years prior to their interview, C*(t_

1) is equal to zero.

For the remainder, individuals who were

smoking two years prior to their interview, maximum consumption is

used as a proxy for C*(t_l) .

16

presented below will be based on this strategy.
To estimate demand equation (20), current and future consump-

tion and a measure of the addictive stock are required. Current
and future consumption come from the data collected in the survey

following the strategy discussed above so that C(t)=C(tl) and
C*(t÷l)=C(t). An estimate of the addictive stock is obtained as
follows. Recalling the assumption concerning the formation of the

addictive stock and assuming that the initial stock is zero, the
stock at time t is:
(21)

ACt) = E: (l_.5)tC(i)

Defining the term (1_6)t1 as D(i), and using the definition for
covariance, equation (21) can be rewritten as follows:
(22)

A(t) = 4. D(i)C(i)
=

[

= tDC + tCov[D(i), C(i)]

- (1_5)t

+

tCov(D(i),

C(i)].

where D and C are the means of D(i) and C(i), respectively.

The covariance term in equation (22) is assumed to be
relatively small and is ignored. Thus, to estimate the stock, mean

cigarette consumption, an assumed constant rate of depreciation,
and the number of years the individual has smoked are required.2'

24 Equation (22) can be modified slightly to obtain the value
of the stock for former smokers. Replacing t with the number of
years the individual smoked and multiplying the resulting expression by (1-6) raised to the number of years the individual since
the individual last smoked yields an estimate of the stock for
former smokers.
17

For individuals who have never smoked, the stock takes on a value

of zero. For smokers, maximum consumption is used as a proxy for
mean consumption.25 Finally, various depreciation rates are assumed

and the sensitivity of the results to these rates is discussed
below.26

In each equation, the individual's age, age squared, sex,
race, real family income, and educational attainment are included

as independent variables.

Finally, each equation also includes

indicators of marital status and labor force status.27

26 Evidence presented in the Surgeon General's reports suggests

that many of the physiological effects of cigarette smoking
disappear relatively soon after cessation. Similarly, most of the
withdrawal symptoms associated with the cessation of the smoking
habit occur relatively soon after stopping, with the only lingering
symptom being a craving for nicotine. This suggests that the
assumed rate of depreciation should be relatively high.

equation), while Columns 2 contains estimates of equation (19) with

no assumed rate of depreciation.

Columns 3 and 4 of Table 1

contain estimates of equation (20) assuming rates of depreciation
of eighty and sixty percent, respectively.

All equations are estimated using Instrumental Variables
procedures due to the endogeneity of past and future consumption
in equation (19), and the addictive stock and future consumption

in equation (20).

In equation (19), current consumption is

specified as a function of one lag of consumption, one lead of
consumption, and lagged, current, -and future cigarette prices,
implying that current consumption is independent of other past and
future prices, suggesting that further lags and leads of prices are

suitable instruments for lagged and led consumption.

Similar

arguments can be made for using several lags and leads of prices
as instruments for the addictive stock and future consumption in
equation (20). Thus, the set of instruments employed includes the

exogenous variables affecting consumption, four lags of price,
current price, and four leads of price, and four lags, current, and

four leads of the excise tax on cigarettes.

28 There are two problems associated with the estimation of
the endogeneity of past and future
these demand equations:
consumption and the limited nature of the dependent variable.
Given the theoretical model, emphasis is placed on the endogeneity

problem rather than on the limited dependent variable problem.
Taking account of both the endogeneity and the limited dependent
variable is intractable.

The lagged, current, and led excise tax rate on cigarettes
are included in the set of instruments in an attempt to reduce the
collinearity problems faced in the estimation of the various demand
equations.
20

In all but one of the estimated equations the coefficients for

past, current, and future prices, future consumption, and the
measure of past consumption conform to the predictions of the
model.

In many of the estimated equations, current cigarette

consumption is found to be significantly negatively related to the

current price of cigarettes.3° Similarly, when included, past and

future prices generally have the anticipated positive effect on

current consumption, with the past price effect significant at

about the fourteen percent level and the future price effect
significant at the fifteen percent level in the models estimated
for the full sample, with somewhat lower statistical significance

for the reduced samples.

In the models which include both the

lagged and led price of cigarettes, the coefficient on past price
is larger in magnitude than the coefficient on future price, except

for the sample of current smokers, as predicted by the model.

Past and future consumption both have significant positive
effects on current consumption. The effect of past consumption is

always significant at the one percent level, indicating that
cigarette smoking is indeed addictive, as expected. The effect of

future consumption on current consumption is significant at at
least the five percent level in all but some of the most general
models, where it attains significance at the twelve percent level,

All statements concerning the statistical significance of
prices, past consumption, and future consumption are based on one—
tailed tests, given the predictions of the model. Other statements
concerning statistical significance are based on two—tailed tests.
When no significance level is indicated, it is assumed to be ten
percent.
21

indicating that individuals are not behaving myopically.

As

predicted, in the two equations presented containing both past and

future consumption, the coefficient on past consumption is larger
in magnitude than that of future consumption.3'

Finally, although the model did not predict the direction of
the relationship between the addictive stock and current consumption, the addictive stock is found to have a significant positive

effect on current consumption in all estimated equations. This

suggests that the reinforcement effect of past consumption is
larger than the opposing effect of an increase in the full price

of smoking as the stock increases.

In general, the estimated

coefficients of prices, future consumption, and the alternative
measures of past consumption are more significant in the models
imposing a higher rate of depreciation on the addictive stock.32

Of particular interest in this work is the long run price
elasticity of demand for cigarettes. To obtain an estimate of this

elasticity, assume that, in the long run, some steady state level

31 similarly, the conditions necessary for stability hold in
all estimated models. These include that the sum of the coeff idents on past and future consumption is less than unity, that the
sum of the coefficients on prices is negative, and that the sum of
the coefficient on future consumption and the coefficient on the
addictive stock divided by the depreciation rate is less than one.

See Becker, Grossman, and Murphy (1988) for a more detailed
discussion of these conditions.
32 Versions of equation (46) were estimated imposing rates of

of consumption will be reached, denoted C*, which serves to replace

depreciation on the addictive stock (C = 6A*, where A* is the
optimal level of the addictive stock).

This implies that a

permanent rise in price will lead to some change in consumption in

each period, and, as a result, in the optimal level of the
addictive stock, until a new steady state equilibrium is achieved.

As Becker and Murphy state, the cigarette demand equations

derived above are second order difference equations in current
cigarette consumption. The roots of these difference equations are

useful in describing the dynamic aspects of cigarette consumption
and will be positive if and only if cigarettes are addictive. The
two roots, for demand equation (19), are:

Becker, Grossman, and Murphy note that, from the assumption of
concavity, both roots are real and, therefore, depend on the sign
of 84.

Similar equations can be derived for demand equation (20)

by replacing 84 with Ø/6 and 85 with

roots, ),

The smaller of the two

the change in current consumption resulting from

23

a shock to future consumption. The inverse of the larger root, 2'

shows the impact of a shock to past consumption on current
consumption. These shocks may be the result of a change in any of

the factors which affect the demand for cigarettes including
changes in the future and/or past price of cigarettes.

Estimates of the long run price elasticity of demand and the

two roots from the demand equation are presented in Table 2 for
each of the models in contained Table 1. The estimated long run
price elasticity of demand falls in the range from —0.36 to -0.27

based on the estimates from the full sample. These estimates are

substantially higher than those obtained from comparable demand

equations estimated under the assumption of non-addictive behavior.33 Estimated long run price elasticities of demand among for

current and former smokers fall in the range from —0.48 to —

0.35.

Finally, the estimated long run price elasticity of demand

for cigarettes by current smokers, based on estimates consistent
with the predictions of the Becker-Murphy theoretical model, falls

in the range from —0.46 to -0.30. These estimates suggest that a
doubling of the Federal excise tax rate on cigarettes to thirty-

two cents (proposed as part of a deficit reduction package),
resulting in an increase of approximately fifteen percent in price

(assuming a competitive market) would lead, in the long run, to
about a six percent fall in average cigarette consumption.

Chaloupka (1988) uses the NHANES2 data to estimate demand
equations ignoring the addictive aspects of consumption and obtains
estimated long run price elasticities of demand in the range from —
0.07 to —0.01.

Examining the estimated roots from the demand equations
estimated using the full sample, one sees that a shock which would

decrease consumption by ten percent in the future would lead to a

fall of between three and five percent in current consumption.
Similarly, exogenous factors which reduced past consumption by ten

percent would lower current consumption by between five and six
percent. The .intertemporal effects of a shock to past or future

consumption found among the sample of ever smokers are quite
similar to those found among the full sample.

Finally, for the

sample of current smokers, shocks to past consumption have a larger

impact on current consumption than for the other groups, while
shocks to future consumption have a smaller effect.
The long run price elasticities of demand presented above are
somewhat lower than the comparable elasticities obtained by Becker,

Grossman, and Murphy. Their estimates, in the range from -0.51 to

—0.80, are obtained using a time—series of state cross—sections
covering the period from 1956 to 1985. Their estimated roots from
the demand equations however, suggest somewhat weaker intertemporal

links in consumption than do those obtained from the estimation of

comparable demand equations using micro—data.
A serious problem in estimating these demand equations is the
collinearity between cigarette prices and the measures of past and

future consumption, possibly resulting in the low statistical
significance of the price estimates. One approach to this problem

is to impose the restrictions suggested by the model.

In par-

ticular, when estimating equation (19), the restriction could be
26

imposed that the coefficients on future price and future consumpti-

on be smaller by the factor l/(l+a) than the coefficients on past

price and past consumption, respectively.

Similarly, when

estimating equation (20), the restriction that the coefficient on

future price be equal to the coefficient on current price multiplied by the factor -(l-6)/(l+a) could be imposed.

Table 3 contains estimates of the coefficients on prices,
future consumption, and past consumption or the addictive stock,
along with the estimated long run price elasticity of demand and
the roots from the difference equation, when these restrictions are
imposed.

Panel A of Table 3 contains the results from the

estimation using the full sample, Panel B contains estimates for

the sample of current and former smokers only, while Panel C

results presented impose the restriction that l/(l+a) =

The

0.7,

a

value suggested by the estimation of the model least subject to the

collinearity problems (that imposing a depreciation rate of one
hundred percent on the addictive stock) .

None of the restrictions imposed has a statistically significant effect on the sum of squared errors, implying that the
restrictions are valid. The main result of the imposition of the

linear restrictions is that the statistical significance of the
price and consumption coefficients is improved, thus leading to
more significant estimates of the long run price elasticity of

Other values for l/(l+a) were assumed ranging from 0.6 to
0.95 with very little effect on the estimates.

linkages in consumption for the sample of current smokers now
conform to the predictions of the model. The estimated long run

price elasticities, however, are almost unchanged. These elasticities are now in the range -0.38 to -0.28 for the full sample, -

0.46 to -0.35 for current and former smokers, and -0.29 to -0.31
for current smokers.35

Time Preference and Addiction

The Becker-Murphy model of rational addiction allows for
differences in behavior through differences in the rate of time
preference. In particular, the Becker—Muprhy model implies that
individuals with a greater preference for the present are potentially more subject to becoming addicted than those with a greater

preference for the future.

Becker, Grossman, and Murphy derive several other price
elasticities of demand based on their version of equation (19).

These various elasticities depend on the timing of the price

change, whether it is temporary or permanent, and whether it is
anticipated or unanticipated. Chaloupka (1988) develops comparable
elasticities for equation (20). The model predicts the relative
magnitudes of each of these elasticities. When the coefficients
on price and/or consumption are estimated in an unrestricted model,
support for the predictions concerning the price elasticities is
mixed. However, the imposition of the restrictions generally leads
to estimated price elasticities which conform to the predictions
of the model. The only exception is the most general version of
the model, that which makes no assumption concerning the rate of
depreciation on the addictive stock. These estimates are available
upon request.

Becker and Murphy (1988), page 682.

It is often assumed that individuals with different levels of
education and/or individuals of different ages will have differing

rates of time preference. Specifically, it is assumed that more
educated individuals will have a greater taste for the future than

less educated individuals. Similarly, it is assumed that younger
individuals will be more present-oriented than older individuals.

In an attempt to examine the possibility of different behavior

based on differences in the rate of time preference, separate
demand equations are estimated for individuals who have completed
high school and for those who have not completed high school. Unrestricted estimates of coefficients on prices, future consumption,

and past consumption or the addictive stock for the two education

groups are presented in Table 4, along with the implied long run
price elasticities of demand. Restricted estimates of these same
parameters are found in Table 537 In no case does the imposition

of the various restrictions have a statistically significant
impact, indicating that the restrictions are valid. The estimates
for those with less than a high school education are presented in
Panel A of Tables 4 and 5, while the comparable estimates for those

with at least a high school education are presented in Panel B of

The restrictions imposed are based on the estimates from the
model which assumes that the rate of depreciation on the addictive
stock is one hundred percent for those with less than a high school
education and from the model which makes no assumption concerning

the rate of depreciation for those with at least a high school
education. Alternative restrictions were imposed based on several
different assumptions, with little impact on the results.

the tables.
Similarly, separate demand equations are estimated for three
age groups: individuals ages 17 through 24 years; individuals ages

25 through 64 years; and individuals ages 65 through 73 years.

Unrestricted estimates of the coefficients on prices, future
consumption, and past consumption or the addictive stock for the

three age groups are presented in Table 6, together with the

implied long run price elasticities of demand.

Restricted

estimates for these groups are found in Table 739 As with the
other estimates, the imposition of the restrictions is not found
to significantly alter the sum of squared errors, indicating that

the restrictions are appropriate. Panels A, B, and C of Tables 6
and 7 contain the estimates for young adults, individuals ages 25
through 64, and the elderly, respectively.

The estimates for the

various education or age groups tend to support the a priori
expectation that individuals with fewer years of formal education

or younger individuals behave more myopically than their more
educated or older counterparts. In particular, for less educated
or younger individuals, past consumption and the addictive stock
have significant positive effects on current consumption, while

Estimates are presented for the full sample only. Estimates
for the sample of current and former smokers and current smokers
only yield comparable results and are available upon request.

The restrictions are based on the model assuming a one
hundred percent rate of depreciation for the two younger age
groups. For the elderly (ages 65-73 years), the implied discount
rate from this model was negative. Instead, it was assumed that
the factor 1/(1+a) = 0.99.

future consumption has a statistically insignificant, positive
impact. Moreover, the ratio of the estimated coefficients of past
consumption to future consumption for these groups implies a very
large rate of time preference, indicating myopic behavior. Again,

the significant effects of past consumption imply that cigarette

consumption is addictive, while the small, insignificant future
consumption effects imply relatively myopic behavior.

On the other hand, for more educated or older individuals,
both past consumption (as measured by either lagged consumption or

the addictive stock) and future consumption are found to have
statistically significant positive effects on current consumption.

This implies that consumption is addictive and that individuals in

these groups are behaving less myopically (or more rationally).
The estimates imply a relatively low rate of time preference for
more educated individuals.

Interestingly, the elderly are not

found to discount the future at all, while the rate of time
preference implied for individuals ages 25-64 is similar to that
obtained for the full sample.
One interesting footnote to the estimation of demand equations

for these subsamples concerns the relative price responsiveness of

the various groups.

Individuals with fewer years of formal

education are found to exhibit a significant long run response to
changes in the price of the addictive good, as illustrated by the

estimated long run price elasticities in the range from -0.62 to
—0.57.

However, more educated individuals are found to be

unresponsive to changes in price.
36

This is consistent with the

Becker-Murphy hypothesis that more present oriented individuals
will be affected more by the market price of the addictive good
than more future oriented individuals due to the relatively minor
role the negative future utility effects of the addiction play in

the computation of the full price of addictive consumption for
these individuals.

However, this hypothesis is not supported by the estimates

obtained for the three age groups. Both young adults (ages 17
through 24) and the elderly (ages 65 through 73) are found to be
insensitive to changes in price, while the rest of the sample (ages

25 through 64) show a significant long run response to a change in

price, as indicated by the estimated long run price elasticities
in the range from —0.46 to —0.3l.° Nevertheless, these estimates
may also be compatible with the predictions of the model. Becker

and Murphy show that more addicted individuals will be more
responsive in the long run to changes in the price of the addictive
good than less addicted individuals.4' They also state that "people

who become old are less likely to be strongly addicted to harmful
goods,"42 implying they will be less responsive in the long run to
changes in price. Similarly, younger individuals will have smaller

accumulated stocks of past consumption, implying they too will be

40 This result is in contrast to the conclusions drawn by Lewit

and Coate (1982) and Lewit, Coate and Grossman (1981). They find
that younger individuals are more sensitive to changes in price
than older individuals.

less addictive and, hence, be less responsive to changes in price.

Conclusions

This paper develops cigarette demand equations derived from
the Becker-Murphy (1988) model of rational addiction and estimates

these demand equations using data on individuals in the United
States.

In general, the estimates support the hypotheses that

cigarette smoking is an addictive behavior and that individuals do

not behave myopically.

Furthermore, the estimates imply that

accounting for the addictive aspects of consumption is important
in understanding individuals' cigarette consumption.

The estimates presented above lend some support to the
hypothesis that increasing the price of cigarettes by increasing

excise taxes on cigarettes is an effective policy for reducing
smoking. A doubling of the Federal excise tax on cigarettes from

sixteen to thirty-two cents (as has been proposed as part of a
deficit reduction program), resulting in an increase of approximat-

ely fifteen percent in price (assuming a competitive market) would

lead, in the long run, to about a four to six percent fall in
consumption.

Further support for the Becker-Murphy model is found from the

estimation of separate demand equations for subsamples based on
education or age. The strong effects of past consumption and weak

effects of future consumption estimated for younger or less
educated individuals support the a priori expectation that these

groups behave myopically. Similarly, the strong effects of both
38

past and future consumption found for older or more educated
individuals indicate more farsighted behavior as anticipated.
Finally, the relative long run price elasticities found for the
various subsamples support the Becker-Murphy hypotheses that more
addicted (myopic) individuals will be more responsive, in the long
run, to changes in price than less addicted (myopic) individuals.

Mathematical APDendiX
Following Becker and Murphy (1988) and Becker, Grossman, and
Murphy (1988), a quadratic utility function in the three arguments,
Y(t), C(t), and A(t) is assumed. The assumption is also made that

the individual's rate of time preference is equal to the market

At this point, to get an empirically tractable demand equation
for cigarettes, the model is converted to a discrete time framework.A1 In discrete time, the maximization problem is the following:

An alternative demand equation which takes account of the
dependence of current consumption on past consumption through the

of the addictive stock, Uc(t), and VA(t) given above (equations
(A15), (A17), and (Al8), respectively), reconsider equation (A21).
