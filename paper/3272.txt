A POSITIVE THEORY OF SOCIAL SECURITY

ABSTRACT

In many countries. social security is a large fraction of the
government budget.

Why is it, given that at any moment in time the number

of recipients of social security benefits is smaller than the number of
contributors?

Kore generally, what determines the size of social security?

To answer these questions, this paper studies an overlapping generations
model in which all individuals currently alive vote on social security.
There is no commitment to preserve the legislation inherited from the past.
Voters are weakly altruistic and there is heterogeneity within each
generation.

The paper shows that in equilibrium the size of social security

is larger the greater is the proportion of elderly people in the population,
and the greater is the inequality of pre-tax income.

Both predictions of

the theory are supported by the empirical evidence in cross-country data.

INTRODUCTION

In many countries, social security is a large fraction of the
government budget.

Table I contains different measures of the size of

social security programs for a large number of developing and industrialized
countries in the late 19?Os and early l980s.

In many cases, and for most

industrialized countries, social security expenditures account for over a
third of total government spending.

Yet, it is difficult to explain why a

social security system exists, let alone why it is so large.

At any given

moment in time, the number of recipients of social security benefits is
smaller than the number of contributors.

So, why does a large majority of

the citizens support a system that redistributes towards a minority?
The literature provides two answers to this question.

The first

stresses intensity of preferences and forms of political participation other
than through voting.

Concentration of benefits among a few and diffusion

of costs among many may explain why retired individuals successfully lobby
to preserve the social security system.1

But for this answer to be

convincing, the costs of the program on the average tax payer must be
relatively small.

This cannot be said of the social security systems

currently prevailing in many countries.2

It seems unlikely that such

programs would be politically viable without the support of a large number
of working individuals.

The second answer provided by the literature attempts to explain why
workers who pay taxes may favor social security.
on the assumption of no future revoting.

The explanation is based

If the current majority can commit

the future majorities to preserve the law, then even a worker would support
social security, provided that his retirement age is sufficiently near.3
But the assumption of no future revoting is clearly counterfactual.

Society

2

cannot precommit its future decisions on social security Legislation.

And

in practice, the legislation has been changed repeatedly over time.4
This paper suggests an alternative explanation of why the social
security system is politically viable.

The central idea is that a social

security program redistributes both across and within generations.

The

contributions to the system are linked to wage income, but the benefits are
not (or are linked to a much smaller degree).

As a result, a social

security system also redistributes from high to low income households (for
the U.S., this fact is extensively documented by Roskin et al (1987) and by
Ferrara and Lott (1985)). Hence, poor workers-taxpayers may be in favor of
the program, since the gain to their retired parents is larger than the cost
to them.

The first part of this paper studies this idea in a simple overlapping
generations model with heterogeneous individuals and exogenous population
growth.

The social security program is chosen in each period under

majority rule.

All the generations currently alive are entitled to vote.

Thus, there is no commitment and in any period the social security
legislation could be repealed.

The absence of commitment implies that

future voting decisions are taken as given by today's voters.

Voter.

The main analytical result is that, with sufficient inequality in labor
income, a social security program is supported in equilibrium by a majority
of the voters.

Moreover, with aggregate shocks to the income of each

generation, the political equilibrium mimics an ex-ante optimal policy of
intergenerational risk sharing, such as that characterized by Cordon and
Varian (1988).

The analysis also yields two positive implications:

there is no crucial discontinuity in the model, the results hold even for

Second, the

linearity of consumption in the parents' welfare implies that all income
effects are absorbed by this term.

This in turn implies that private

their relative incomes.

The Data

For reasons of data availability, I aggregate together social security
and welfare expenditures)8

Table 1 displays three different measures of

the size of the social security programs of various countries.

The first

column measures real expenditures in social security and welfare per person
over 65 years of age.

The other two columns measure social security plus

welfare expenditures in proportion to GNP and to total. government spending

taking also into account the variables listed below.

The first measure of the size of the social security program (scaled to
the size of population over 65) is the closest equivalent of the variable
in the previous theoretical. model.

g

However, it could be measured with

error, because the conversion from nominal to real international prices may
be imprecise (see the data appendix), and because the size of the population
over 65 could reflect measurement errors.

For this reason, I also consider

spending.

This last variable

(in proportion to government spending) is

particularly meaningful, even though it has no theoretical counterpart in
the previous model.

Across countries, the size of the social security

program is strongly positively correlated with the overall size of
government.

This is to be expected, since the size of government depends on

factors neglected in the theoretical analysis (such as the availability of
tax bases and the general political preferences of the citizens) which aLso
determine the size of the social security program.
Hence, it may

also

be appropriate to test the predictions of the model when

social security is measured in relation to total government spending.
Table 1 underscores how different is the size of social security in
different countries, both per capita and in proportion to C&P and to the
size of government.

Most of the industrialized countries (marked with an

asterisk) have relatively large social security programs; but this is also
true of some of the developing countries, particularly when social security
is scaled to total government spending.

Can these differences be explained

by the theory formulated in the previous sections?
According to the preceding model, the size of social security is
related to the relative proportions of tax payers and retirees among voters,
and to the distribution of income,

I measure the former by the proportion

of individuals over 65 years of age in the total population ("prop65"), and
the latter by the ratio of the pre-tax income received by the top 20% of the
population over the pre-tax income received by the bottom 40% of the
population ('TincratioM).

Thus, the larger is the variable incratio, the

more concentrated is the distribution of income.

For a number of countries,

only the distribution of post-tax income is available.

theory.

besides the variables dictated by the

model, only the post-tax dummy and the dummy for industrialized countries

The regression fit is remarkably

good, considering the large variance in the dependent variables, except when
the sample only consists of the industrialized countries; this may be
because in the latter case we have too few observations.

The estimated

coefficients of the variables of interest (prop65 and incratio) always have
the correct sign.

If we neglect the sample of only the industrialized

countries, which is probably meaningless given the extremely poor fit, the
estimated coefficient of the variable propGS is always highly

The variable incratio is also significant for several

regressions, particularly when social security is measured in proportion to
total government spending.

Table 4 contains the estimated coefficients when the other explanatory
variables (urbanization and/or per capita income) are added to the
regression.

significant, the same results of table 3 are obtained:

variable incratio always has a positive estimated coefficient, which is also
statistically significant when social security is measured in proportion to
total government spending.

The same kind of result is obtained when

alternative combinations of the dependent variables and of the explanatory
variables are tried, and in particular when social security is measured in
relation to GNP.

To further assess the robustness of the estimates I tried alternative
specifications besides those reported in Tables 3 and 4.

First,

I

interacted the industrialized dummy variable with the two variables of
interest, prop65 and incratio, to allow for differences in the slope
coefficients between the two sample of countries.

and/or per capita income in Table 4 with the share of the agricultural
sector in CDP.

Again, the coefficients of interest did not change.

Finally, I created a new dummy variable that distinguishes between
democratic and non-democratic regimes.

Strictly speaking, the theoretical

model only applies to democratic systems.

But the new dummy variable was

always insignificant both when interacted with the coefficients of interest
and when included as an additional variable, and the other estimated
coefficients were not affected by it.

I conclude from these regressions that we generally cannot reject the
predictions of the theory:

social security is larger in countries with a

greater proportion of elderly people in the population, and in countries
with a more unequal distribution of pretax income.

The predictions of the

theory are only rejected in the sample of industrialized countries, that
contains too few observations.

Sensitivity Analysis

A central question is whether the previous results are robust to errors
in measuring the two explanatory variables of interest. prop65 and
incratio.

to answer it, I compute consistent bounds on their coefficients.

Under the conventional hypothesis of the error in variables literature, even
if these two variables are measured with error their true maximum likelihood

19

coefficients lie within these bounds.2°
Our procedure exploits the results of Klepper and Learner (1984).

Consider first equation (1) in Table 3.

First.

I estimate the coefficients

of prop6S and incratio by alternatively interchanging each of them with the
dependent variable (social security per individual over 65).

I

thus obtain

three estimates for each coefficient, one of which corresponds to that
reported in Table 3.

For both variables, the signs of the three

coefficients are the same across the three estimators.
and Learner (1984),

As shown by Kiepper

I can then conclude that the true maximum likelihood

coefficients lie within the convex hull of these three estimates.

I then

repeat the sante procedure for the remaining five columns of Table 3.

I find

that for both variables, the three estimates always lie in the same orthant.

Hence, I can compute the consistent bounds on the coefficients of prop6S
and incratio for all the regressors reported in Table 3.
These bounds are reported in Table 5.

The lower bounds always happen

to coincide with the 0LS estimator of Table 3.

1 infer from this table that

the findings of the previous subsection are robust to the possibility of
measurement error in income inequality and in the proportion of the
population over 65 years of age.

Finally, heteroscedasticity of the residuals is often a problem with
cross-sectional data.

indeed, here the White (1980) test on the covariance

matrix of the estimated residuals rejects the hypothesis that there is no
heteroscedasticity.

However, when the covariance matrixes for the

regressions of Table 3 are reestimated using White (1980) consistent
estimator, the

t

statistics are not substantially different from those

reported in Table 3 and the two variables of interest generally remain
significant.

In addition, when the regressions in Table 3 are reestimated

20

by weighing each observation with per capita income, the results are
generally unchanged, even though the regression fit tends to deteriorate.

Concludina Remarks

This paper started with a question:

why does a majority of the voters

support a social security system that redistributes income towards a
minority of the population?

I formulated a

To answer this question,

positive theory of social security that relies on a simple central idea.
Social security redistributes both across and within generations.

For this

reason, it is supported by the recipients of the social security benefits,
as well as by the poorest tax payers.

Then this idea is formalized in a

simple overlapping generations model, two positive implications are
obtained.

The size of the social security program is larger

U)

the

greater is the proportion of retired individuals in the population; and
the greater is the inequality of pre-tax income.

(ii)

Both implications

are strongly supported by the empirical evidence on cross-country data.
But the ideas studied in this paper lead to a second, deeper, question.
Why

is

it that in many countries most of the intragenerational

redistribution occurs through the social security system?

Outside this

system there are not many purely redistributive programs:

in most countries

welfare expenditures are small compared to the size of social security.

So,

why do we observe that inter and intragenerational redistributive policies
are intertwined together through a single policy instrument?
analyzed in this paper cannot answer this question.

The model

Specifically, suppose

that in the previous overlapping generations model we add one more
instrument that enables the government to transfer a lump sum also to every
young individual.

This additional instrument breaks the link between inter

21

and intragenerational redistribution.

Hence, in equilibrium all the kids

would vote against any positive transfer to the parents, and the tax
proceeds would only be redistrthuted among the kids; the equilibrium would
then resemble that of Meltzer and Richard (1981), in which a majority of the
voters favors a policy that taxes and redistributes.

So, why isn't this

extra instrument used more systematically?

Perhaps, the answer is to be sought in a more complex model of
political interaction.

In this paper, the voters preferences are single

peaked and the political equilibrium is the policy preferred by the median
voters.

But in a more general environment, the political equilibrium would

reflect the formation of different coalitions.

A coalition of poor tax

payers and retirees would presumably support a social security program like
that observed in most countries, and described in this model.
previous question could be reformulated as follows.

So, the

Why is it that in many

countries we observe the formation of this particular coalition of voters?

Considering that major reforms to most social security systems are fairly
recent and date to the same postwar period, it is likely that the answer to
this new question has much to do with particular historical circumstances.

Further exploring this issue, and more generally the question of how
coalition formation influences policymaking, is a difficult but exciting
task for future research.

22

Foo tno te s

1This explanation is proposed for instance in Patton (1978).

Stuart

and Hansson (1989) study an overlapping generations model that implicitly
relies on this idea.

The same assumption, that the old choose the equilib-

rium policy, is also used in two interesting papers by Loewy (1988, 1989).
2For instance, according to Boskin, Kotlilcoff, Puffert and Shoven

(1987), more than half of the workers in the U.S. pay more in OASDHI
contributions than they pay in personal income taxes.
3This point has been explored in several papers.

See for instance

Browning (1975) and more recently Broadway and Wildasin (1989a,b) and
Cukierman and Meltzer (1989).
1'Some

recent interesting papers (Kotlikoff, Persson and Svensson

(1988), and Sjoblom (1985)) argue that "reputation" can substitute for
commitment.

Succinctly, if a young generation reneges on a social security

program, it is punished by the succeeding generation who refuses to
reinstate the program.

The threat of this punishment may deter each young

generation from reneging.

These reputation equilibria are extensively and

critically discussed in Persson and Tabellini (1989).

5Altonji,

Hayashi and Kotlikoff (1989) provides empirical support for

this assumption.

6The specification of preferences is plausible and simplifies the
algebra, but is not crucial for most of the results.

Equally unimportant is

the assumption that individuals care about the indirect utility (rather than
the consumption) of their relatives.

7Meltzer and Richards (1981) have analyzed the determinants of the size
of redistributive policies in a related framework.

However, they study a

23

static model, in which the issues of intergenerational redistribution and
commitment do not arise.

25

would exactly implement the ex ante optimal risk sharing only for particular
parameter values.

18When available, welfare is generally a small proportion of social
security plus welfare expenditures.

I use data on expenditures rather than

on contributions because the latter are available for a much small sample of
countries.

l9

may be argued that when social security is measured by scaling

expenditures to the population over 65, we may be introducing some spurious
correlation between the dependent variable and the explanatory variable
prop65.

But if anything, this would bias the coefficient of prop6S

downwards, and hence it would make it more difficult to reject the null
hypothesis that prop65 has a zero coefficient.
20The maintained hypothesis is that the measurement errors are

orthogonal to each other and to the unobserved correctly measured
regressors.
