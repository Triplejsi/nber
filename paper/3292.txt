DETERMINANTS OF SAVING AND LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION OF THE ELDERLY IN JAPAN

ABSTRACT

Japanese annual time series data covering the period 1951 to 1982 reveals
that changes in the program of social security retirement benefits have
substantial influence on personal saving and retirement behavior. The
empirical results show that social security retirement benefits depress
personal saving by approximately 13.5 thousand yen per capita in real terms
from 1951 to 1982. However, declining labor force participation of the elderly
(i.e., earlier retirement), stimulates personal saving by an estimated .5
thousand yen over the same period. The study finds that the benefit effect
dominates the retirement effect. The net effect is consequently a downward
impact on personal saving. The parameter estimates indicate that the
retirement behavior induced by social security retirement benefits tends to
become more sensitive and responsive to a rise in the benefits. In addition
this study has identified a negative interdependency between the personal
saving and labor retirement behaviors; that is, an individual saves more before
retirement if he expects to stay a shorter time in the labor market, and vice
versa. Moreover, personal saving influenced by retirement behavior tends to
become less and less responsive, though the results indicate a relatively large
response, and although very small, the retirement behavior gradually becomes
more responsive to change in personal saving.

I, Introduction
In the debate over high Japanese personal saving, the Japanese saving and
consumption behavior have come under fire. In spite of conceptal differences
in saving between Japan and the United States and other nations personal saving
rates in Japan remain higher than that of the United States. The ratio of personal saving to disposable income has been markedly high since World War II. It
was sometimes over twenty percent and is currently about sixteen or seventeen
percent. Although a relatively large public debt-to-GOP ratio (26 percent)
exists, the excess saving over investment in Japan creates a huge pool of savings
which flow out to foreign nations. Researchers have focussed increasing attention on the high Japanese saving rate. Despite the number of recent studies,
there is still no consensus among researchers, nor a full understanding of
Japanese saving behavior. This paper sheds light on Japanese personal saving
from the different aspects related to social security retirement benefits and
to elderly labor force behavior.
The previous studies on saving have attempted to explain various aspects
of Japanese saving behavior. In the National Survey of Family Income and
Expenditure (micro data in 1974 and 1979), Ando, Yamashita, and Murayama
(1986) remark that one of the reasons for a high saving rate stems from a high
growth rate. In the macroeconomic framework, Hayashi (1986) concludes that
the growth rate does not explain the high saving rate in Japan. Dekle (1986),
Hayashi (1986), and Hayashi, Ito and Slemrod (1981) emphasize a bequest motive
of saving in a life-cycle model. Ishikawa and Ueda (1984) find bonus payments
exert positive effects on personal saving and simulated results show three percentage points of contribution to the saving on average. However, the bonus
hypothesis does not provide a dominant explanation of Japanese saving. Sato
(1987) uses a theoretically sound target wealth hypothesis in an attempt to
explain Japanese personal saving behavior when it is not adequately explained
by the permanent income hypotesis and the life-cycle hypothesis. His empirical arguments CCSP/BOJ Survey mainly focus on inflation, demand for labor and
demand for housing as exogenous variables. These exogeous variables give
theoretically robust results. However, the major shortcoming in Sato (1987)
is that a treatment of welfare pension is ignored, although evidence of
welfare pension effects on personal saving are inconclusive in Japan.

Despite many theoretical and empirical U.. studies on the effect of
social security retirement benefits on saving, there are few on this issue
for Japan. By analyzing a substitution between expected retirement payment
and preretirement wealth accumulations, and using time series data (from the
Family Saving Survey, and the Family Income and Expenditure Survey,
1968-1980), Noguchi (1983) does not draw decisive conclusions about the effect
of social security retirement benefits on wealth accumulation. Estimated
coefficients are not sensitive to the choice of age groups and are negative.
However, the coefficients do not provide statistically significant robust
results. Sasaki and Tachibanaki (1965) use the same data with a different
period (1966—1982) than Noguchi (1983) uses. Unlike Noguchi, Sasaki and
Tachibanaki conclude that the effect of social security retirement benefits on
household saving is significant with cohort classification. They report that
the substitutability between social security retirement benefits and household
saving increases as age cohort rises.

-2In the studies on Japanese saving, arguments overlook the importance of
an increase in aging population. Ando, Vamashita and Murayama (1986) suggest
that early retirement induces a high saving rate with a life—cycle hypothesis.
They, however, introduce the question whether prolonged retirement raises or
lowers the saving in Jaan and conclude that an increase in aging population
may lower the saving rate.
Seike (1982) examines the influence of social
security retirement benefits and household saving on elderly labor supply
using individual data in 1974 from Zenkoku Shohi Jittai Chosa (ZSJC) and
Chingin Kozo Kihon Chosa (CKKC). The ZSJC is household survey data and does
not provide labor supply information. The CKKC is labor supply data and does
not contain nonlabor income, i.e., social security retirement benefits data.
In spite of the restriction of data. Seike skillfully manipulates the data and
demonstrates the impact of social security retirement benefits on labor
supply. The impact is statistically significant, though noderately small.
The coefficients for the stock of saving variables are somewhat embarrassing
and positively significant. His theoretical explanation of income preference
by elderly labor supply behavior seems to be unsound. The micro data in Japan
provide little evidence of saving behavior in terms of a change in retirement
and an increase in aging population in Japan. Even though Horioka (1990) surveys the literature and comprehensively discusses various factors which have
been suggested as possible causes of the high saving rate in Japan, further
studies are required to understand behavioral patterns concerning high personal saving in order to guide policy actions.
Previous studies in Japan frequently neglected the relationship between
personal saving and retirement, and their behavioral simultaneity. Crosscountry tests by Modigliani and Sterling (1983) show robust evidence that
the labor force participation of the elderly and an insufficient welfare pension in Japan have a negative influence on the saving rate. Feldstein (1980)
treats the labor force participation rate of older men as endogeneous and
finds that an earlier retirement raises the saving rate in the 12 industrial
country sample. The determination of saving and retirement habits seems
to be endogeneous decisions. To demonstrate a simultaneity of personal saving
and retirement, this study employs personal saving and labor force participation o the elderly as endogenous in the framework of an extended life
cycle model.
The empirical work of this study, using Japanese time—series data, also
attempts to explain the impact of social security retirement benefits on personal saving and the labor force participation of the elderly in Japan. Such
a study is necessary for predicting behavior patterns concerning saving and
retirement, and for guiding policy actions. This study will attempt, as well,
to provide theoretical and empirical explanations of saving and retirement
behavior, and their behavioral interdependency. Horioka (1990) addresses an
advantage of a time-series data application. He explains traditional and
cultural influences on the high Japanese saving rate, and the difficulty of
empirical tests for traditional and cultural aspects. In this respect
Horioko implies that the time-series approach is better than a cross-sectional
one. Since tradition has presumably weakened over time, the saving rate
should show a long—term downward trend if the saving behavior is attributed to
tradition. Therefore, the empirical relationship between personal saving and

social security retirement benefits.

II. A Brief Review of the Social Security Program
Japan has dual and partially funded public welfare pension schemes. The
Employe&s Pension Insurance Plan CEPI) covers a majority of Japanese workers.
These workers are employees of firms in industry and commerce with five or
more employees. An employee in a non-corporate firm, even though it employs
less than five employees, is still qualified for a voluntary coverage subject
to approval. At age 60, EPI provides a labor earning related benefit financed
by equal employer and employee payroll tax contributions. The EPI receives a
payment from the general budget for one—third the amount transferred from the
EPI to the NPI Cthe National Pension Insurance). A flat tax rate of 12.4% is
applied to monthly labor earnings up to a maximum 710 thousand yen, the minimum being 68 thousand yen for male workers. The other is the National Pension
Insurance plan (NPI) which covers any economically active Japanese workers not
otherwise insured and self—employed. At age 55, NPI provides a universal flat
basic benefit financed by the self-employed, non-employed adults, students
(age 20 years and over), and contributions from the EPI which also includes
contributions on behalf of nonemployed wives. NPI receives a subsidy from the
general revenues amounting to one-third of benefit costs less transfers from
EPI. The lump sum amount, 6,800 yen in 1986, is contributed monthly by the
self—employed, nonemployed adults and students. The contribution will be gradually raised every year and employed persons and their spouses are exempted
from the contributions. Benefits under both EP! and NPI are automatically
adjusted for changes of 5% or more in consumer prices during a year or two
years and more. Both require 25 years of contributions.
In addition to the two major public welfare pension schemes, a special
system (mutual aid associations) covers local and national government
employees, employees of agricultural and fishery cooperative associations, and
private school teachers. There is also a special program for seamen. As
shown in Table 1, both members and beneficiaries of EPI have constantly been
increasing compared to other plans.

The receipts of the welfare pension tax (social security tax) are deposited in special treasury accounts (Trust Fund Bureaus) and the fund is
managed by the Treasury Investment and Loans Division. As of 1985, the accumulated pension fund was 27,983 billion yen. The EPI and NPI reserves serve
a public function. For the purpose of improving living conditions, the fund
is used for housing, living environment improvements, small enterprises,
culture, education, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, etc. The interest rates
were fixed by the government at rates below market. The rate is now based on
market rates after 1987 legislation. The proceeds of the interest payments
are used for part of the administrative costs of the social security program.
The Employee's Pension Insurance plan was promulgated in 1941 and implemented in 1942 while the National Pension Insurance plan was promulgated in
1959 and implemented in 1961. Both EPI and NP! are partially funded public
pension schemes. Since its inception, the EPI has evolved and implemented
these programs an introduction of minimum guarantee for survivors permanent
disability benefits, an introduction of eligibility for social security
retirement benefits while remaining on the job and an increase in benefits in

—5

1965, an introduction of automatic price adjustment for benefits due to the
1973 oil crisis, and relaxations of qualifying conditions in 1976, 1978, 1979
and 1980. The benefits of EPI have increased markedly in 1965, 1973, 1974,
1975 and 1982. The NP! has also involved: an introduction of automatic price
adjustment for benefits in 1974. a special payment of pension insurance for
uninsured adult residents in 1978. a guarantee of minimum pension benefits for
survivors and orphans in 1979, and an abolition of requirement of nationality
in 1982. The benefits of NP! were greatly raised in 1974, 1975 and 1977 after
the oil crisis..

The Japanese government made a major reform of the public welfare pension
scheme (shown in the Appendix) in 1985 and implemented it in April 1986. The
catalyst for this reform came from the inception and implementation of EPI in
1942 and of NPI in 1961. There are several reasons for the reform. While the
estimated number of persons 65 and over is currently at 10% of the population,
the government expects this number to rise to 17% by the beginning of the 21st
century. The ratio of elderly to working-age population will sharply increase
from 7 working persons for an elderly person who is 60 and over, to 3.5
working persons. Because of this concern, the future financial health of the
public welfare pension program is threatened by drastically rising costs in
the aging population. Because of increasing life expectancy, retirement years
for beneficiaries are prolonged. Changes in the nuclear family and dwindling
job opportunities cause financial hardships for the elderly. The Ministry of
Health and Welfare has estimated that an ideal benefit amount should equal 68
percent of the average wage among workers. Unless the public welfare pension
scheme changes, the combined employer-employee contribution for male workers
would have risen from 12.4 percent in 1985 to above 40 percent in the 21st
century. A reverse situation occurs when calculating an average net income
between a beneficiary and a worker. In an effort to eliminate the redundancy
of benefits and schemes of EPI and NPI (including four other mutual aid associations and a special program for seamen), the public welfare pension plan
now covers all segments of the working-age population. The seamen's insurance
system was merged with the EPI program in 1986. The dual public welfare pension program provides uninsured protection to all Japanese residents.

III. Analytical Framework
The empirical model of the paper is based on the extended life-cycle
framework. Studies by Feldstein (1980). Hamermesh (1984), Mitchell and Fields
(1984), Ando et al. (1986), Bernheim (1987), Moffitt (1987) and Modigliani
(1988 demonstrate that this approach s the most common and useful framework
for applied analysis to examine saving and retirement behavior. Saving and
retirement behavior involve lifetime utility maximization with certainty.
This study assumes that lifetime utility is intertemporally separable and that
the interest effect exceeds the time preference effect. These simplifying
assumptions are helpful and fairly innocuous to the life—cycle framework.
Killingsworth (1986) thoroughly discusses the approach and the advantages of
these assumptions.
Many recent applied analyses of life-cycle behavior have focused on
saving and retirement behavior separately. Feldstein (1980) explicitly develops the extended life—cycle model treating the labor force participation rate
of older men endogenously. Hamermesh (1984) addresses jointness in decisions
about consumption and retirement. Consider a population group of elderly
whose average labor force participation rate is 30 percent. This does not
mean that 30 percent of the individuals among the elderly are almost always in
the labor rorce and that the remaining 70 percent are almost completely
retired individuals. Rather, it means that the same individuals (within this
cohort) are sometimes in and sometimes out during the transitional period.
Their participation rate tends to decline gradually as the individuals age.
Therefore, one possible hypothesis is that within a sex, a population group of
elderly has equal tastes and desires to offer the same amount of labor at any
given wage rate and wealth. Its rate represents the behavior of market activity in a lifetime labor supply (i.e. the proportion of time spent in the
labor force during the lifetime). Although the retirement decision is an
individual decision, an analysis of the labor force participation of elderly
workers is an analysis of retirement behavior (Boskin 1977). Although labor
force participation of the elderly depends on other factors such as the proportion of people in the labor force, the aggregate data approach mitigates
the difficulties in controlling for individual taste, computing a wage for
nonworking population, and measuring an individuals health status (Ouggan
1984, and Breslaw and Stelcner 1987). The eligibility age for social security
retirement benefits was sixty before the reform of 1986 (as shown in the
Appendix). This study uses the labor force participation of elderly aged 60
and over as a proxy measure of retirement in the population of those who
expect to spend their lifetime economic activity in the labor force. Although
there are other ways of using the labor force participation of the young or
workers of all ages, the measurement biases are less severe if an implication regarding only retirement behavior is made by using the labor force participation of the elderly.
The extended life—cycle theory predicts that late retirement reduces personal saving during the preretirement period for consumption during a shortened retirement period, and vice versa. Higher social security retirement
benefits reduce personal saving and induce earlier retirement, and vice versa. 6
The annuity value of the benefits does not change with the age of acceptance

—7—
because there is not a delayed retirement credit in Japan. Therefore delayed
retirement time does not affect the amount of benefits. Needless to say, personal saving does not affect the social security retirement benefits.
Burkhauser (1979) demonstrates that such a system will not cause a laborleisure distortation. A choice of labor force participation of the elderly
a;ed 60 and over becomes less of a selection problem as a variable of retirement behavior. The implication is that the amount of saving and social
security retirement benefits exerts different influences on the quantity of
lifetime labor supply. Conversely, labor supply and social security retirement benefits affect life-cycle saving. Consequently, a model should reflect
not only the effects of social security retirement benefits upon the personal
saving and labor force behavior of the elderly, but alo the interactions between the two behaviors, i.e., saving and labor supply.
Saving and labor
supply choices generally are represented by an individual i at time t,

f(LF, SS, SE1) + e.1

z(S. SS SE) + e2

where S is personal saving, IF is the labor force participation rate of
men ages 60 and over to be a pri?,xy variable to measure a retirement behvior of the elderly, SE1 is a vector of socio-economic characteristics.
SS. represents social security wealth with two different techniques9for
cajitalizing benefit streams. The first one is actUarial valuation employing
net social security wealth (SSN), gross social security wealth (SSG) and
social security tax contribution (SST). The second is simple valuation
employing present value method with non-constant interest rate by accumulating
and discounting social security retirement benefits (SSAB). and social

security tax contribution (SSAC). The e in (8) and (9) are stochastic error
terms, because there are components of pa?sonal saving and labor force participation of the elderly that are affected by unmeasured factors.
There are five aspects for capital resources: personal saving (household
saving), corporate saving, government saving, private saving (the sum of
personal and corporate saving) and national saving (the sum of private and
government saving). There are various factors which influence behaviors of
different types of saving. Each specialized study uses a different model and
makes specific assumptions. To characterize Japanese high saving rate,
personal saving is the most salient feature of saving behavior. Graham (1987)
demonstrates a better description of personal saving behavior than the
national one and he proves the consistency of statistical results with the
life-cycle hypothesis. Thus personal saving seems to be a more behaviorally
meaningful concept suggested by Ando (1986) than other types of saving.
In spite of finding the negative relationship between elderly labor force
participation and saving by Feldstein (1980) and Modigliani and Sterling
(1983). Ishikawa (1987) addressed the high labor force participation rate of
the elderly in Japan as a major positive factor of the high saving rate.
Horioka (1990), however, argues that it does not necessarily raise the overall
personal saving rate from the views of life—cycle saving, and that the retirement age has a significant negative impact on personal saving. A high labor
force participation of the elderly (i.e. later retirement) implies less need

-8for retirement assets and therefore a lower saving rate is a characteristic
clue of the generalized life-cycle model. As for retirement, the elderly
workers can not be characterized in terms of a simple dichotomy full-time
labor force commitment versus full retirement. Generally, a transitional
period is closely associated with reduction in hours of work, weeks worked
during the year, and labor force commitment. A declining labor force cQmmitment is another sign of retirement commitment. If the retirement age in a
population group is not specified, the labor force participation rate of the
aged is measured as a proxy variable of a retirement rate of the aged.
The anticipated social security retirement benefits in old age are not
only an important factor in household wealth, but also the major component of
wealth in most retirement portfolios. With its compulsory government-directed
saving program, the social security tax payment system produces future social
security retirement benefits for retired workers during their retirement
period and until dealth. The studies on effects of social security retirement
benefits on saving in the United States has developed in the literature of
Feldstein (1974), Barro (1978), Darby (1979), Leimer and Lesnoy (1982),
Modigliani and Sterling (1983), Blinder, Gordon and Wise (1983), Modigliani
(1986, 1988) and Kotlikoff (1988). The significant progress in the Japanese
social security retirement program since the Second World War has not yet
clearly revealed its influence on the behavioral pattern of personal saving.
But everyone seems to agree that personal saving will be reduced by the
availability of expected future social security retirement benefits by providing income for consumption during the retirement period, i.e., the "benefit
effect," and personal saving will be increased by inducing earlier retirement
caused by expected future social security retirement benefits. The earlier
retirement means a longer period of retirement under a given life span. This
requires an accumulation of saving during the working period: the "retirement
effect." Thus, the net effect of social security retirement benefits on personal saving depends on the relative strength of these offsetting effects.
It is interesting to note that before April 1986, the Japanese social
security system underwent a few major and a few minor institutional changes
shown in Section II. An introduction of eligibility for social security
retirement benefits while remaining on the job and a leap in benefits in 1965,
and an indexation of benefits to the price level in 1973 were major changes.
The variable 55 (SSN or SSG or SSI or SSAB or SSAC shown definitions of
variables in Table 3) denotes a social security wealth variable. The variable
SS*j reflects 1965's development of the program and is used to estimate a
different slope of the segments before and after 1965. SS*D2 indicates the
social security wealth variable multiplied by two dummy variables such as OX =
1 for 1965 through 1982 and zero otherwise, and DV = 1 for 1973 through 1982
and zero otherwise and observes the slope of the regression line after 1973.
Needless to say, incorrectly omitting a reflection from the institutional
change term will lead to a specification bias.

Personal disposable income or labor, nonlabor income and tax would
measure the current flow of resources available to the household sector for
consumer ex?8nditures and saving in addition to financial assets by
households,
Boskiri and Kotlikoff (1985) point out that the strict life—

-9cycle model is not enough to explain the United State's saving behavior.
Therefore, this study expands the life-cycle model by employing additional
explanatory variables.
One aspect of the variable of life expectancy is that public opinion
surveys find that preparation for illness and other unexpected emergencies are
the motives for saving in Japan. Risk aversion and precautions are Japanese
characteristics demonstrated by Ilorioka (1988). An increase in life expectancy is a proxy measurement of healthiness, i.e. less illness and it would
reduce personal saving. A similar line of argument is provided by Horioka
(1990) that the ratio of the population of the aged to the working-age population has a significant negative impact on the saving rate. An increase in
life expectancy which stems from healthiness, contributes to the aging population. Thus the life expectancy would have a negative influence on saving.
One may argue that an increase in life expectancy will increase the period of
retirement and necessitate more saving for the prolonged retirement period.
This view of the argument is an interesting theoretical consideration but the
argument is a weak one, which is proved theoretically by Graham (1987). As for
an influence of life expectancy on labor force participation Hamermesh (1984)
observes that an increasing life expectancy does not lead to a lengthening of
the average person's work life. In his U.S. study on the jointness of leisure
and goods consumption i.n household production, he found that the extra years
of life are consumed as leisure. Seike (1982) finds similar results in his
empirical study on Japan. For these studies we can conclude that an increase
in life expectancy has a negative influence on the labor force participation
of the elderly. Life expectancy as a proxy measurement of healthyness may
have a positive influence on working life, namely, late retirement, although
the health variables used by Hausman and Wise (1985). Honig and Hanoch (1986)
and Burtless (1986) are the self—assured health report from individual survey
data on the U.S. studies.
Financial assets are characterized by great divisibility, namely, great
liquidity. More recently, in Japan, financial assets have been creating additional wealth in household portfolios. It seems that the lower- and middle—
income classes are stimulated and motivated to enter the liquid assets market
formerly targeted exclusively for the higher income class, as well as for corporations preferring to deploy their holdings in more speculative investments.
In particular, the amount of financial assets held by households has more than
tripled in Japan since 1975. Noland (1988) analyzes Japanese portfolio allocation behavior and finds substitutes between financial assets, and money and
time deposits. Unlike non-liquid assets, such as expected social security
retirement benefits for the retirement period, financial assets may exert a
negative effect (see Burtless 1986) and a different magnitude on the labor
force participation of the elderly, i.e., the retirement decision. For the
variable of education, the more general argument is that investments in human
capital raise the return to additional years of work. The more educated tend
to retire later and to save more. The empirical evidences on the U.S. studies
show the positive relationship between educational attainment and the elderly
labor force behavior (Ouggan 1984, Housman and Wise 1985, Honig and Hanoch
1985, and Slade (1987).

Unlike the United States, housing acquisitions stem from non—pecuniary
motives in portfolio allocation by households and housing is less liquid in

— 10 —

Japan. Evidence from the U.S. study by Hayashi, Ito and Slemrod (1981)
shows that just the opposite seems to occur in the United States. Housing
acquisition behavior and financial assets should separately be analyzed to see
an influence on saving behavior. Japanese housing conditions are still madequate, and people want to own a house within their lifetime (Takayama, 1982
and Shinohara, 1983). This desire sterns from a basically agricu lt:
national characteristic which has historically influenced the behavior of
holding physical assets by households. In Japan, physical assets such as
housing, are usually held for life and for the purpose of bequests in the life
cycle framework rather than for the speculative purpose of wealth accumulation, as often occurs in the United States.11 This bequest purpose of
obtaining one's own house seems to stimulate personal saving and then the
saving declines at acquisition or purchase time. Modigliani (1986) points out
that the consideration of bequest motives in the life—cycle framework is consistent, although during the retirep!nt period assets decline and reach zero
in the basic life-cycle hypothesis.
Retained earnings are business saving in the private sector and proxies
for current and future capital gains. They are treated as exogenous with
respect to the personal saving decision because there are separate incentives
governing the behavior of household and corporate sectors (Auerbach, 1982).
Retained earnings can be considered a measure of saving whether or not they
arise from pension plan contributions. They represent an additional investment in corporate equity by stockholders. Looking at retained earnings
another way, we might find that retained earnings imply a substitution for
personal saving (Modigliani and Sterling, 1.983). Business firms accumulate
retirement pension allowances for their employees and transfer retirement pension allowances into retained earnings in Japan. Increased retirement pensions undertaken by business firms for their workers tend to discourage
workers from personal saving because of an increase in anticipated retirement
pensions provided by the firm in the futuce. Therefore the effect by retained
earnings on personal saving is ambiguous.1°
The labor f1rce participation rate of elderly women has been growing over
the past decade.
The question is whether the increase affects the elderly
male labor force participation or not. It is important to understand the
issues of the elderly labor market and the cost of social security retirement
benefits. Retirement studies by Henig and Hanoch (1985) and Hurd (1988) find
that wives in the labor force positively affect the male labor force participation, namely later retirement in the United States. The effect of the
total level of agricultural employment on labor force participation of the
elderly takes several possible forms. High agricultural employment is often
believed to encourage high labor force participation of the elderly because
self-employment allows a varying choice of work hours and work intensity, and
it has no mandatory retirement age or company pension system to encourage
retirement at a specific age. Alternatively, retirement from full—time agricultural employment may be easier because it is less costly to care for the
aging period on a farm than in urban settings.
Households are very concerned with not only current but also future
inflation. A surge in inflation will reduce a real value of household wealth
and induce households to increase their saving to maintain the real value of

— 11

—

wealth.

This view is explained by Sato's (1987) wealth target hypothesis. On
the other hand, inflationary expectations will reduce a real rate of return on
saving and in turn induce households to reduce their saving (Horioka, 1987).
Rampant inflation causes an increase in uncertainty about the future. This
phenomenon may raise a precautionary purpose for saving. The foremost external factors were factors such as the oil crisis of 1973-74 and 1979-early
1980s. The first oil crisis of 1973—74 raised the personal saving rate and
the second oil crisis did not raise the rate but rather saving declined in
Japan. The relation between inflation and personal saving seems to be a
short—term factor as Sato (1987) discusses. Sato gets positive results in the
analysis of financial—asset wealth target. The influence of inflation on
household saving is theoretically ambiguous and leads to a qualitative and
quantitative conclusion. Therefore, this analysis includes a dummy variable
to distinguish an inflationary period. To differentiate the oil crisis from
the rest of period 03 = I is used for observations from 1973 to 1982 and zero
otherwise.
The main data used to estimate the model are annual data from Annual
Report on National Account covering the period from 1951 to 1982. Since
national income series are revised a few times, the series before 1951 is poor
in quality, and the next series starting from 1951 runs into the j97Os, the
data of analysis start at the year of 1951. The latest version is very extensive and goes back to 1965. Therefore, the study includes a dummy variable to
identify and to treat the data series as D4 = 1 for 1965 through 1982 and 04 =

Empirical Results

The data used to estimate the model is an annual tine series covering the
period from 1951 to 1982. The simultaneous equation model consists of an
equation for personal saving and an equation for labor force participation of
men ages 60 and over. Tables 2-1 and 2-2 present the results obtained trom
two—stage least squares (2SLS) with correction for serial correlation.1
In
order to compare the results of two different techniques for capitalizing
social security wealth streams, model I (SSN), model II (SSG) and nodel LII
(SST) in Table 2—1 pertain to actuarial valuation and model I (SSAB) and model
II (SSAC) in Table 2—2 pertain to simple valuation. An overview of the
results in Tables 2-1 and 2—2 indicates that all the estimated coefficients of
saving and labor force have the anticipated signs. The coefficients of primary interest, that of saving and labor force, confirm that an increase in
labor force participation of the elderly, i.e., later retirement, reduce personal saving and an increase in personal saving induces earlier retirement,
namely, lower labor force participation of the elderly. In most cases the
magnitude and significance levels of the the saving and labor force coefficients do not vary dramatically between the two specifications. The results
support the arguments of Feldstein (1980), Ando, Vamashita and Murayama
(1985), Bernheim (1987), and Horioka (1990) that the determination of the
saving and retirement decisions certainly seem to be endogeneous. The estimated coefficients on personal saving and the labor force participation rate
of the elderly are statistically significant and support the hypothesis of
interdependency of personal saving and retirement. One percentage point
decrease in the the labor force participation rate, namely earlier retirement,
tends to stimulate the the personal saving rate from .4 to .6 percentage
points. The coefficients in the saving equations ranging between -.4 and - .6
imply very meaningful sensitivity of personal saving to this measure of
retirement behavior. The cross-county study by Graham (1987) shows statistically insignificant and smaller positive coefficients with ordinary leastsquare estimates. The similar study by Feldstein (1980), however, indicates
the negative impact on personal saving ranging from - .3 to - .6 with two-stage
least—squares estimates. Horioka (1989) finds the range between -.4 and —.6
by parameter estimate based on data for 1916-1962 period of the 21 OECD
countries. The point elasticities evaluated at the sample means are -2.5
(1951—1964), —1.9 (1965—1972), and -1.4 (1973—1982) on average. Although the
elasticities are elastic, declining elasticities show that personal saving
behavior tends to become less and less responsive to changes in retirement
behavior. In the columns of labor force in Tables 2-1 and 2-2 one percentage
point increase in the the average personal saving rate encourages the elderly
to leave the labor market in the range between .26 and .69 percentage points.
A decrease in the labor force participation of the elderly means earlier
retirement. In terms of elasticity with different periods, the point elasticities of labor force participation of the elderly with respect to personal
saving at the sample means range froni - .05 to - .13 between 1951 and 1964, from
-.07 to —.18 between 1965 to 1972, and from —.09 to —.23 between 1973 to 1982.
In general, an increase in elasticities implies that although very small, the
retirement behavior gradually becomes more responsive to change in personal
saving.

The estimated coefficients of social security wealth variables are one of
principal interest in this analysis. Estimated coefficients in both saving
and labor force equations are generally qualitatively consistent with both
actuarial valuation in Table 2—1 and simple valuation in Table 2-2. The estimated coefficients of Model III SST in Table 2-1 and Model II SSAC in Table
2-2 are normally larger than SSN. 550 and SSAB. However, quantitative differences based on actuarial and simple valuations are quite similar between
SSN and SW measurement and SSAB measurement, and between SST measurement and
SSAC measurement. The results of this study provide that two different techniques for capitalizing social security wealth streams possibly have similar
depressive effects on personal saving. With respect to the effect of social
security variables on saving the estimated coefficients of the time-series
analysis are smaller than the studies done by Noguchi (1983): .010 - .148, and
.14 - .291. using the data of Family Saving
Sasaki and Tachibanaki (1985):
Survey in Japan. For the studies of cross—section of countries, Feldstein
(1980) reports .21 - .37 and Graham (1987) shows .02 - .09. U.S. studies on
the effect of saving is in the range between .03 and 0.117 by Munnell (1974)
by using time—series data, and in the range between .695 and .941 for individuals and .773 — 1.37 for couples by Bernheim (1987) by using Longitudinal
Retirement History Survey. The results in this study cannot be simply compared
with those previous results done by Japanese and U.S. researchers shown in
Table 2-3 because the units of value are different. Evidence presented in
this study suggests that a 1 percent increase in social security retirement
benefits depress personal saving during 1973 and 1982 from 2 percent to 3.1
percent. Personal saving in Japan is very sensitive to a change in the social
security retirement benefits.

What is of special interest in the regression results is to examine the
implications for personal saving. Before the introduction of eligibility for
social security retirement benefits while remaining on the job and a large
leap of the benefits in 1965, the social security retirement benefits had a
positive effect on personal saving, shown by the SS variables in the saving
equations in Tables 2—1 and 2-2. During the period of 1951 through 1964, personal saving increased approximately 2.3 thousand yen per capita in the saving
equation of Model I SSN. The major change in the program in 1965 negatively
affected saving behavior which is represented by the SS*OI variable in the
saving equations. With the similar calculation in Model I 59.1, the increase
in SSN over the period of 1965 through 1972 resulted in approximately a 2.8
thousand yen reduction on personal saving per capita in real terms. The next
wave of change was the introduction of automatic price adjustment for benefits
in 1973, because of the oil crisis, and the benefits also increased in that
year. The personal saving per capita in real terms decreased by approximately
13.0 thousand yen during the period of 1973 through 1982. The net reduction
of benefits during the period of 1951 through 1982 was approximately 13.5
thousand yen per capita.
Saving equations in Tables 2—1 and 2-2 show that a reduction in labor
force participation, (i.e., earlier retirement), makes individuals in the
preretirement period save more for consumption during a prolonged retirement
period. The estimated impact on personal saving by earlier retirement was
about a 21.2 thousand yen increase in personal saving per capita in real terms

— 14 —

from 1951 to 1964, a 55.5 thousand yen increase from 1965 to 1972, and a 97.8
thousand yen increase from 1973 to 1982. Hence, during the period from 1951
to 1982, the absolute amount of the upward impact on personal saving was a
174.5 thousand yen increase, which was about thirteen times of the amount of
upward impact of the social security retirement benefits in saving equation
Model I SSN. However, as shown in footnote 7, to discuss a retirement effect
the estimated coefficients on social security variables in the labor force
equation should be examined to avoid downward bias. The retirement effect
from 1951 through 1982 is aproximately .5 thousand yen per capita. The net
impact on personal saving during the year of 1951 through 1982 was a reduction
in personal saving by 13.0 thousand yen per capita (SSN). Similar calculations for the net impacts from the statistical results provides a 10.7
thousand yen reduction (550), a 59.4 thousand yen (SST), a 12.1 thousand yen
(SSAB). and a 86.4 thousand yen (SSAC). The downward impact of SST and SSAC
models are about five or seven times as great as SSN, 550 and SSAB models.
Unlike the assertion by Bernheim (1987). the results of this study find that
actuarial valuation compared to simple valuation does not tend to overstate
the incentive effects of social security retirement benefits on personal
saving. In Japan, the benefit effect outweighs the retirement effect and the
net effect is consequently a downward pressure on personal saving.
The coefficients of SS*DJ. (an introduction of eligibility for benefits
while remaining on job and other developments in the program in 1965) and
SS*02 (an introduction of automatic price adjustments for benefits in 1973) in
labor force equations in Tables 2—1 and 2-2 are negative as expected. The
coefficients are small and similar to Saike's (1982) finding (—.002 - -.003)
in a Japanese study. Using the method of actuarial valuation, Slade (1981)
has —.001 and Burkhauser (1979) shows a range from -.002 to —.011 in the U.S.
studies. In this study, an increase in social security retirement benefits by
one thousand yen induced the elderly to retire in the range between .001 and
.03 percentage points during 1965 through 1972, and in the range between .002
and .08 during 1973 through 1982. The impact seems to be small. Put differently the point elasticities of labor force participation of the elderly
with respect to personal saving at the sample means are in the range between
—.05 and -.1 during 1965 through 1972 and —.2 to -.6 during 1973 through 1982.
A one percent rise in the benefits induced the elderly to leave the labor
market by a .2 percent to a .6 percent after 1973. An increase in the elasticity from the period of 1965—1972 to 1973—1982 implies that the retirement
behavior becomes more sensitive and responsive to a rise in the social
security retirement benefits, though the results indicate a quantitively small
response.

The estimated coefficients on the variable indicates that the disposable
income is negative in the saving equations. The negative sign shows that the
elasticity of the average personal saving rate with respect to disposable
income is smaller than one. Two saving equations in Table 2-2 have only statistically significant coefficients. The negative coefficients of disposable
income in the labor force equation in Table 2-2 suggests a decrease in labor
force participation, namely life time labor supply, as income level rises.
An overview of the results in Tables 2—1 and 2-2 indicates that all estimated coefficients of Life as a proxy measurement of healthyness have the

- 15

—

anticipated

signs. In most cases the magnitudes and significance levels of
the coefficients do not vary dramatically among the saving equations.
Although motivations for saving are interchangeable within the range of lifetime planned saving, motivations come from several sources, such as precautionary purposes, speculative purposes and life-cycle purposes. The
precautionary motive for illness would weaken as health status improves. The
relative importance of motives for household saving is seen in Horioka (1988)
and this econometric empirical result is congruent with his survey data
demonstration. The point elasticities evaluated at the sample means are in
the range between -1.88 and -2.16. One percent increase in life expectancy,
namely healthiness, reduces personal saving from a 1.68 to a 2.16 percent.
One way to gauge the magnitude of estimation is to assume 40 years of accumulated personal saving lower by from 91 to 104 thousand yen per capita at the
sample means by the age of sixty. The recent figures will be much larger
using current data than the statistical sample means. For labor force
equations the result of the life variable is consistent with the hypothesis of
the jointness of leisure and consumption in the life-cycle context formulated
by Namermesh (1984). The estimated negative coefficients show that a one percentage point increase in life expectancy reduces labor force participation of
the elderly by the range of from 1.3 to 2.1 percentage points. An increasing
life expectancy alone does not lead to substantial postponing of economic
activity in the labor market. Seike (1982) also finds the negative effect of
increase in aging on labor supply in the Japansese study. The elderly tend to
change from income preference to leisure preference as they age. Put differently, the extra years of life are consumed as leisure.
Financial assets have a negative effect on labor force participation and
a one percentage point increase in the average financial asset rate causes
about a .5 percentage point decrease in the labor force participation in Table
2-2. The effect is significant in Japan. The study on the U.S. by Burtless
(1986) also finds that the average retirement age is 1.1 years earlier among
the elderly who have assets of $25,000 and more than the wealth holder with
less than $25,000. The estimated coefficients of education are theoretically
consistent and positive in saving and labor force equations as expected but
almost always insignificant unlike the study on the U.S. done by Hausman and
Wise (1985), Honig and Hanoch 1985), and Slade (1981).
The negative coefficients of housing are congruent with the study done by
Noland (1968). Noland finds the substitute between saving and housing in his
portfolio analysis of Japanese households. Looking at average personal
housing expenditure rate another way, the results in Table 2-1 means that a
one percentage point increase in housing expenditure rate lowers the personal
saving rate between 2 and 2.5 percentage points. An increase housing expenditure is also partly a reflection of the growth of the housing stock.
Therefore it implies less need for saving for bequest purposes (Modigliani
1986). The negative coefficient suggests that the point elasticity of the
average personal saving rate with respect to the personal housing expenditure
rate is less than one. As for retained earnings, the extended life-cycle
saving in this study reflects the impact of the average rate of corporate
retained earnings on personal saving. As proxies for current and future capital gains, retained earnings have a short-run effect on personal saving in

— 16 —

addition to their long-run wealth effect. The coefficients are qualitatively
consistent in Tables 2—1 and 2-2. The positive coefficients in Table 2-1 show
that a one percentage point increase in retained earnings raises the average
saving rate about .5 percentage point. However, the retained earnings
variable is likely to be an underestimate of net corporate saving. The qualitative results seem to show a complementarity between personal saving and
retained earnings.
Turning attention to the female labor force, the estimated coefficients
on the variable indicating the female labor force in the labor force equations
are statistically significant and positive for all models. The magnitude of
coefficients implies that a one percentage point increase in female labor
force participation, aged 60 and over, would lead to a rise in the male labor
force participation, aged 60 and over, by from .5 to .8 percentage points.
The elderly tend to retire later. The results suggest ideas similar to those
posited in U.S. studies. lionig and Hanoch (1985), and Hurd (1988) analyze
elderly male workers' retirement behavior and how a wife in the labor force
affects the retirement of male counterparts and joint retirement of the
elderly. The probability of retirement decreases by from .3 to .4 when a wife
is in the labor force in the U.S. (Honig and Hanoch). The effect in a similar
study on the U.S. by Hurd is .47. Although the explanatory power in this
study is different from the U.S. studies, the implication suggests the comple—
mentarity of leisure by male and female elderly workers in Japan. Agriculture's coefficient is positive and statistically significant in the labor
force equation in Table 2—2. This suggests that the decline in the agricultural sector reduces the labor force participation of the elderly.
The ratio of personal saving to personal disposable income was above 21%
from 1973 through 1978 after the unexpected oil crisis that caused higher
inflation in the 1970s and early 1980s. The variable 03, a dummy variable,
distinguishes an inflationary period from the rest of the period. The estimated positive coefficients on an inflationary period, 03, in both the personal saving and labor force participation equations indicate that the
deviation of real saving and income from its normal position will make the
individual anxious about future prospects. Therefore an increase in uncertainty caused by high inflation makes the individual motivated to increase
personal saving, and to stay in the labor market. Horioka (1989) also finds a
positive effect of inflation on the private saving rate by using the data of
the 21 OECO countries for 1976—1982. The coefficients on 03 in the labor
force equations are positive and statistically significant. The results imply
that an increase in a price level, namely, higher inflation, has an effect on
labor force attachment among the elderly. As for D4, it is a dummy variable
denoting the Annual Report on National Account for New SNA data as explained
in Section III. The results indicate a positive effect of New SNA data on the
interpretation of personal saving and labor force participation by treating
the series of data for New SNA. The results are in the range between 16 and
22 percentage points in saving equations and 8 and 9 percentage points in
labor force equations in Table 2—1.

CONCLUSIONS

The paper examines the impact of social security retirement benefits on
personal saving and the labor force participation of the elderly, and also on
the interdependency between saving and retirement behaviours. The results
underscore the qualitative and quantitative importance of the social security
retirement benefits. Calculations based on actuarial and simple valuations
(two different techniques for capitalizing the streams of social security
retirement benefits) provide quantitatively similar depressive effects on personal saving. Considering the two major changes in institutional programs in
1965 and in 1973 the benefit effect outweighs the retirement effect between
1951 and 1982. The results indicate substantial evidence of the downward net
impact on personal saving; approximately a 11.9 thousand yen per capita reduction resulted from the wealth measurement {SSN, 550 and SSAB) and about a 72.9
thousand yen per capita reduction on average resulted from tax contribution
measurement (551 and SSAC). Moreover, the point elasticities evaluated at the
sample means are elastic and quite large. The finding implies that the personal saving is very responsive to changes in the social security retirement
benefits. The study also presents evidence with respect to the potential
importance of the effects of social security retirement benefits on life-cycle
labor supply. The eligibility of the benefits induce the elderly to leave
their jobs or to restrict market work and thereby reduce the labor force participation of the elderly, which results in earlier retirement of older
workers.
One of the important conclusions of the analysis is that there exists
interdependency between personal saving and labor force participation of the
elderly. Saving behavior became less and less responsive to change in labor
force participation of the elderly between 1951 and 1982, while the labor
force participation of the elderly, i.e., retirement behavior, came to be more
responsive to change in personal saving. However, the results of personal
saving behavior influenced by social security retirement benefits and labor
force participation of the elderly (proxy indication of tine of retirement)
reveal higher sensitivity with elastic elasticity than the results of labor
force participation of the elderly influenced by the social security retirement benefits and personal saving with inelastic elasticity.
It is interesting to note that an increase in life expectancy. i.e., an
improvement in healthiness, reduces emergency funds which stems from the
Japanese characteristic of saving motivated by precaution. However, an
increase in life expectancy does not encourage the elderly to remain in the
labor force. They prefer to enjoy leisure in the extra years of life rather
to than earn income from economic activity. Although far from explicit, the
results provide an explanation of joint retirement. Because a rise in elderly
female labor force participation does not expel the elderly male from the
labor market, but rather complements it. The estimated coefficients on inflation have a positive effect on both personal saving and labor force participation of the elderly. An increase in uncertainty and deviation of real
saving from its normal position stimulate personal saving. A rampant inflation also causes a strong labor force attachment among the elderly.

Individuals contemplate the amount of their own future social security
retirement benefits for the retirement period. The motivation for saving
is much more complex than simply for purposes of retirement. And many factors
also influence retirement behavior. However the recent development of a social
security program in Japan substantially depresses personal saving and induces an
earlier retirement of older workers. The policy implications of the findings
are clearly visible. For instance, a rise in eligibility and the amount of
social security retirement benefits and a rise in the social security retirement tax which is closely linked to the future retirement benefits, would
vastly reduce personal saving and clearly induce later retirement. The policies would make the elderly stay in the labor market because the results in
this study signify a relatively small response of retirement behavior to a
change in personal saving and social security retirement benefits. Moreover,
to mitigate the fears of the elderly for their financial problems during their
retirement period, an increase in the retirement benefits is fundamental.
A gap between the eligibility of age for the benefits and actual retirement
among the elderly may require an initiative of the government and the private
sector's cooperation in terms of an employment policy for the elderly.

1.

Hayashi (1986), Horioka (1990), and Ohmae (1988) explicitly discuss
personal saving in terms of valuing depreciation, capital transfer,
interest paid by household, housing investment, and capital gains
and losses in the case of the United States and Japan.

(Chochiku Zokyo Chuo Iinkai), a private but government-encouraged

organization, with the assistance of the Bank of Japan.

3. Feldstein (1974; 1982), Feldstein and Pellechio (1979), Munnell (1974),
and Darby (1979) find a significant negative effect of social security
retirement benefits on personal saving, whereas Barro (1978). Blinder,

Gordon and Wise (1983). Leimer and Lesnoy (1982), Lesnoy and Leimer
(1985). and Modigliani and Sterling (1963) find it to be insignificant.

A cross-country test by Graham (1987) also finds an insignificant impact
of social security upon private saving unlike Feldstein (1980)'s findings.

4. Horioka (1990) suggests that a high labor force participation, namely the
late retirement in Japan, may have a negative influence on personal
saving.

5. Graham (1987) conducts an interesting econometric test by using the labor
force participation rate of females as an endogeneous variable with two-

— 20

stage

least squares.

6. Boskin (1977) stresses that social security retirement benefits influence
the elderly to leave the job or to restrict market work, thereby reducing
the labor supply of the elderly (see Pellechio 1979, Burtless and Moffitt
1984 and 1985, Hurd and Boskin 1984, Mitchell and Fields 1984, and Burtless
1986, which support this induced retirement effect).

7. The omission of a LF variable from the model would cause the estimated
coefficient on the SS variable to be biased towards zero. To be specific
consider the following variables model:
S =

where S is personal saving, SS is social security retirement benefits and

LF is labor force participation variables, a1 c 0, and a2 <

Individual private pensions are still at an early stage in Japan and the

data are not available to integrate the variable into the model. The

— 21 —

expected influence of this factor on retirement and on saving behavior
may be clearly visible. Difficulty to reconstruct the variable and to
verify the influence empirically stems from inadequate data.

9. The social security wealth variable in this study employs gross social
security wealth (SSG) constructed as follows: the SSG of the typical
individual of age a is defined as

SSG =
a

Ab (K-Z)Y LtI e'(t dt,
K(>60)

where I is a maximum life time, K is a retirement age, 60 is an eligible
age for social security retirement benefits, A is a growth rate of per
capita income, b is a base rate of retirement benefit which is assumed to
be same for each person with same income level, Z is an age of beginning
to work, V is an annual disposable income,

is probability of an

individual of age a surviving until t, and r is the discount rate.

Social security tax contribution (SST) of an individual of age a is
defined as:

In constructing the social security wealth variable, Leimer and Lesnoy
(1982) and Lesnoy and Leimer (1985) suggest modifying the original social

— 22 —

security

wealth variable used by Feldstein (1974) and Munnell (1974).

This study takes into account the suggestion by Leimer and Lesnoy (1982).
10. Hall (1978) intensively discusses the lagged level of disposable income,

namely past income, whióh has lack of predictive power for consumption,
namely saving, in the context of the life cycle—permanent income hypothesis.

11. In 1983. 72.2 percent of the declared value of bequests were in the form
of housing which includes land (Oekle 1986).
12. Horioka (1988) emphasizes that a household which obtains a house within
five years has a higher saving rate because of a housing loan than other

households. Japanese banks require about 32% (a relatively high down—
payment) for the purchase of a house, compared with the 10% to 20% typi-

cally required by U.S. banks. Thus Japanese households have to save in
advance to purchase a house due to the uneasiness of consumer credit.

It is quite possible that the recent increasing availability of housing
loans would also decrease a housing purpose saving in the life cycle
framework in Japan.

13. The data for business firms' accumulated retirement pensions for workers
and individual private pensions are not available to integrate the

variable into the model for this study. The expected influence of
these factors on the labor force participation and on the saving behavior

may seem obvious. it is, however, extremely difficult to reconstruct and
verify the influence empirically because of inadequate data.

15. In the model of simultaneous equations in this study, in order for the
equation to be identified, the order and the rank conditions of then-

tifiability was examined. The equations are overidentified and the rank
condition is satisfied. Therefore, a choice of consistent estimation in
the study is two-stage least squares (2SLS). For detail, see Oamodar Pg.

The study controlled for the National Pension plan by using a dummy

variable beginning in 1961. The coefficient was statistically insignificant, with little qualitative and quantitative changes. The reason
being the functional characteristics of the program (explained in

section II and Appendix). The dummy variable was deleted from the regression analysis.
