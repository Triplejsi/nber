AMERICAN FIRMS FACE EUROPE:

1992

ABSTRACT

The press and business magazines are filled with stories about a rush of
American firms into the European Community to take advantage of, or avoid the
adverse consequences of, the expected formation of a single market in 1992.
Yet, it is hard o find evidence of a large shift in plant and equipment
expenditures, employment, or financial investment toward the EC countries by
American firms. The main reason seems to be that large American manufacturing
firms are already well entrenched in the EC, and may even be better positioned
to take advantage of the single market than most of their European rivals. The
U.S. firms (unlike most Japanese companies) already supply almost all their
share of the EC market from operations within the EC and depend very little on
importing from the U.S. There is some indication of moves toward EC production
by non-manufacturing operations such as distribution and services, by smaller
companies, by those not now producing extensively in the EC, and by firms
hoping to take part in public procurement.

The American press and business magazines are filled with stories about

Europe-1992, advice to firms about how to respond, and predictions about the
effects on American firms that range from cheerful optimism to grim pessimism
about protectionist schemes.

Surveys of American executives confirm the

intensity of their interest. The Economist (May 13, 1989) reported that a
group of CEOs of mainly high—tech firms almost all saw the developments as an
opportunity to expand their sales and operations, and more than half said they
"would change their marketing and production strategies to exploit the new
opportunities." Another survey of a smaller number of CEOs of very large firms
reported that a majority had commissioned internal or external studies of
desirable steps to respond to the new situation.
There are two very different views about the prospects for American firms
in Europe. One is that the free internal market will produce much larger and
more competitive Europe-based firms, and that the increased competition both
in Europe and in other markets, combined with mercantilist practices by the EC
authorities, will pose a severe test for American companies. The other is that
American firms, in contrast to Japanese and other outside firms, are already
well established in Europe and accustomed to serving the European market by
producing there rather than by exporting, and that they are actually more
suited to taking advantage of the end of internal barriers than are most of
their European rivals. For one thing, they are not hamstrung by national
loyalties and may be better able to resist pressures to retain inefficient
operations and to seek the best methods of production and the best locations.
An important characteristic of American manufacturing affiliates and even
wholesale trade affiliates in the EC is that they are relatively independent

-2of imports from the U.S.

For manufacturing affiliates, these imports are only

about 5 per cent of total sales in the EC, as compared with 11 per cent in all
developed countries.

Thus, the EC affiliates of U.S. multinationals, not heavily dependent on the
U.S. for supplies or components, are not very vulnerable to protectionist
measures against imports.

The parents of these affiliates could be vulnerable to protectionism in
the EC even if their affiliates were not, if the parents had large exports to
the EC outside of those to their own affiliates. In fact, of U.S. multinationals' sales within the EC of over $400 million in 1982, only a little over
$40 million were parent exports from the U.S. and a little over $25 million
were parent exports to unaffiliated foreigners (Appendix Table B). Thus, not
only the EC market shares of U.S. affiliates, but also the EC market shares of
the U.S.

multinationals of which they are a part, are supplied to an

overwhelming extent from inside the EC itself.
How have American firms responded to the first indications of the possibility of a single European market and to the later signs that the creation of
the single market was really going to take place? There is a great deal of

—3—
anecdotal evidence of moves by American firms to entrench themselves in the EC

market before 1992. What do the data suggest as to the importance of these
moves? An indication of the importance of EC operations to American firms at
the beginning of the 1980s is given by the EC share in the net stock of, and
expenditures on, plant and equipment in 1982.

The EC has long been the location for a majority of the overseas operations of American firms in developed countries, and an even larger part of
manufacturing operations. Almost half of worldwide fixed assets in manufacturing outside the United States were in the EC countries in 1982, long before
the move towards the free internal market. And the shares of plant and equipment investment taking place in the EC countries were even larger than the
shares of existing fixed capital. This traditional importance of the EC

—4—
countries in U.S. multinationals' overseas operations must be kept in mind in

judging

the response to the plans for 1992.

The European Community has passed through a series of stages in its
development. The first was the abolition of tariffs among the original six
members, completed in 1967. It was followed by the expansion of the Community
to its present 12 members, the last of which, Spain and Portugal, entered in

January 1986. A third stage, foreshadowed by the 1985 agreement on the
European CommisSion'S White Paper on creating a single internal market, was
set in motion by the ratification of that proposal in 1987.
To compare the early 1980s position to plant and equipment spending

in

later years, we can divide the period since 1981 into three parts, the first
three years, 1982-84, before the agreement on the single market, the second,
1985-87, mostly after the publication of the White Paper on Completing the
Internal Market (June 1985) but before ratification made the change appear
certain, and the third, 1988—90, after ratification (July 1987), including
plans for 1989 and 1990 reported in a survey taken in June 1989.

These data, summarized in'Chart 1, do not show any stampede to build new
or improved capacity in the EC area on the part of American firms as a group.
The total fixed investment planned for 1988—90 in the EC accounts for a
slightly larger share of all investments in developed countries than existed
at the beginning of the 1980s, but the difference is not very large: 59 per
cent as compared with 54 per cent, and the 1988-90 share planned is only a
little above the 57 per cent of 1982—84. In non—electrical machinery, the
current EC share is less than during most of the 1980s and in electrical and
electronic equipment, it is below the share in the stock at the beginning of
the 1980s. The increases in the EC share of fixed investment in manufacturing
are in chemicals, well above the initial 1982 stock and the capital expenditures in 1982-84, and in transport equipment, where the share is above the
expenditure share of most of the 1980s and back to the 1982 share of the
stock.

-.7The strongest signs of increased fixed investment in the EC so far are
not in manufacturing but in wholesale trade (mainly sales affiliates of U.S.
manufacturing firms), finance, except banking, and in the "other industries"

group. The last includes agriculture and mining, construction, public utilities and transportation, and retail trade, of which retail trade accounted for
about two thirds of the stock of fixed capital in 1982. In all of these
industries, the EC share of actual and planned fixed investment in 1988-90 is
above the share of expenditure in the 1980s and also above the share of the
stock at the start of the 1980s.
Thus,

it appears from the capital expenditure data that American firms

already established in the European Community are concentrating on
strengthening their presence in marketing and finance more than in manufacturing or the petroleum industry.

The Economist article quoted above referred to "... an extraordinary
change. ..'

in

American investment in Europe and shows a chart indicating that

the share of the EC in the stock of U.S. direct investment almost doubled between the end of 1984 and the end of 1987, after a considerable decline between
1981 and 1984. Why do the plant and equipment expenditure data described above
picture so much milder a response? The decline in the EC share of the direct
investment stock before 1985 partly reflected the fact that EC currencies fell
in exchange value relative to the U.S. dollar more than others did before
1985.

They also rose more rapidly after that, particularly as compared with

the currencies of developing countries between 1984 and 1987. Much of the rise
in the relative importance of the stock of direct investment in the EC after
1984, therefore, reflected capital gains on these investments rather than new
investment by U.S. firms.

-8—
One measure that is not affected by exchange rate developments is
employment. Unfortunately, the data do not extend beyond 1987, but a comparison between 1982 and 1987 suggests that up to that date at least, there
was no major expansion of employment in response to the agreement on the
creation of the free internal market.

The EC share of employment by U.S. firms in developed countries was actually
slightly lower in 1987 than in 1982. The sharpest decline in the EC share was
in transport equipment, largely from the sale of Chrysler subsidiaries in
1986, and the largest increase was in finance other than banking, mostly after
the deregulation of the London stock market, also in 1986.
The employment and plant and equipment investment figures might fail to
reflect an upsurge of financial investment, if it occurred, perhaps to acquire
existing firms or prepare for eventual plant and equipment investment.

The

data for such investment in the EC countries are somewhat spotty and fre-

reflect net new investment, they are often dominated by the financial operations of established firms that make most of their investment out of reinvested earnings.

However, any large rise in the flow of new funds into EC

investment would probably be revealed by these data.
For what they are worth, the flows of equity and debt investment also do
not show any overall upsurge to pay for new investment.

Overall, new investment in 1987 and 1988 was no higher than in 1985-86,
although the 1988 investment was above the 1982—84 level in current dollars.
However, the fall in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar since 1982-84 has
been so great that the purchasing power of the 1988 investment must have been

- 10
below that of the 1982—84 expenditures.

-

In manufacturing there was a net

outflow of equity and debt capital in 1988, and essentially no flow for 1987
and 1988 together.

The only possible indications of a substantial move to new

U.S. direct investment in the EC was in wholesale trade and in finance other
than banking, two of the industries in which capital expenditures also showed
some signs of growth.

The data on total direct investment outflows are available up through a
more recent date (the third quarter of 1989) for all industries combined. They
are a poor indicator of new projects, however, because reinvested earnings are
a large part of the flows, and their movements are dominated by fluctuations
in earnings. They do show a resurgence of capital outflows to the European
Community in the first three quarters of 1989, as compared with the similar
period in 1988 or with the whole year 1988.

The share in the first three quarters of 1989 was almost back to, but no higher
than, that of 1985—86.

If American firms' European affiliates, particularly in manufacturing,
have not been investing heavily in new financing or in new capacity, what
accounts for this apparent lack of response to new opportunities? One reason
is that so many American manufacturing firms have been heavily involved in
investing abroad, particularly in the EC countries, for such a long time. As
early as 1977, U.S. companies reporting to the Department of Commerce as
parents of foreign affiliates accounted for over 60 per cent of total U.S.
manufacturing employment, and the proportion in the main investing industries,
chemicals, machinery, and transport equipment, was over 90 per cent (Kulchycky
and Lipsey, 1984, Table 1). Of these foreign investors, two thirds had operations in the UK alone, and in the main investing industries, the proportion
was over three quarters. Thus, almost all the investing firms must have
already been operating within the present EC boundaries by that time.
The involvement of American firms within the EC area goes back even
further. While Canada was the host to the largest number of American firms in
1966, the UK was second or third in most industries, and Germany and France

- 12

—

were usually fourth and fifth (Kravis and Lipsey, 1982).
There is a widespread feeling that American firms already established in
Europe are already ahead of European firms in treating the EC as a single
market and are well placed to take advantage of the elimination of barriers
(Peck, 1989). The Economist suggests, for example, that General Motors and Ford
have more "Europe—wide strength" than any of their local competitors, strong
though many of them are in their own national markets, and that the same is
true in their fields for other American companies such as IBM, Digital
Equipment, and Unisys. In another article, Hewlett-Packard was described as
having "... a better geographical balance of sales both worldwide and within

the EEC than do its European competitors."

("Hewlett-Packard: Safety in

Numbers," The Economist, August 12, 1989, p. 57).

The main European companies,

each with sales concentrated in its own small national market, "... are
expected to look for partners to help them expand elsewhere.

Hewlett-Packard's

door is always open" (Ibid).

Similarly, the boom in the European market for personal computers is
being met largely by American computer makers, and they are all reported to be
shifting ".

. .production,

research, and marketing activities to their European

subsidiaries," as is Toshiba ("Europe Goes Wild for Yankee PCs," Fortune,
June 5, 1989, pop. 257).

Several other examples are noted in the EC

Commission's assessment of the effects of the removal of internal barriers.
They mention, for example, that U.S. construction firms in Europe won
contracts the value of which was ten times the total of all those won by
European firms outside their own countries (Emerson et al, p. 53).
various industries, they suggest that "...

Surveying

strongly positioned and rationalized with respect to the European market

- 13

itself,

—

compared to multinational firms from the United States, Japan, and

some EFTA countries (as in foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals, and telecommunications

equipment) (Emerson et al, pp. 66-67). The report mentions the food-processing
industry as one in which most European companies are oriented towards their

own national markets, while the ten largest groups, outside of Nestlé and
Unilever, are American, and are geared to serve the EC market as a whole
(Emerson et al., pp. 70—71). A similar story is told of the pharmaceutical
industry, in which American and Swiss firms are best placed to take advantage
of the reduction of trade barriers (Ibid. p. 75).

Some American firms in the

pharmaceutical industry reported fairly low levels of capacity utilization,
which would permit them to expand production without additional capital expenditure.

The major economic gains to the EC countries from the elimination of
trade barriers are expected to come from scale economies and the increased
level of competition and reduction of monopoly power. The ranking of
industries by the size of economies of scale finds, at the top of the list,
mostly just those industries in which American multinational firms hold strong
positions in world markets. These include motor vehicles, aircraft, chemicals,
office machinery, and other types of machinery. Industries in which the U.S.
and American multinationals are weak are mostly at the bottom of the ranking
(Ibid, pp. 129—130). Thus, it is another advantage for American firms that the
greatest advances in efficiency and reductions in cost are expected to take
place in the industries in which they are strongest.
It is possible that the relative lack of expansion plans for these
existing companies reflects satisfaction with their current position within
the EC, and that it is companies now outside the EC that are responding

- 14

strongly

—

by engaging in acquisitions of, and mergers and joint ventures with,

EC companies. It is hard to find evidence on rates of new entry, but a survey
conducted for KPMG Peat Marwick, among a sample of executives in almost 600
companies in high technology, other manufacturing, transportation, and
merchandising, found that of those (29 per cent of the total) not currently
doing business in the EC, over two thirds said they had no plans to do business there before or after 1992 (KPMG Peat Marwick, 1989, p. 7). Only 6 per
cent of the sample, 21 per cent of the current non-participants, project some
type of entry into the EC market before 1992, not a strong indication of a
rush to participate.

On the other hand, it is true that when new entries into production in
Europe by American firms are announced, the reports usually mention 1992 as
one of the reasons for the move. It was cited for example, in a recent story
about Intel's first plant in Europe, a $400 million computer and semiconductor
plant in Ireland ("Intel Plans to Build Irish Computer Plant at $400 million
Cost," Wall Street Journal, October 4, 1989, p. B?). The possible growth of
service industry investment is suggested by stories about American law firms'
hopes for expansion in Europe ("U.S. Law Firms, Catching 1992 Fever, Bet
They'll Gain Edge in United Europe," Wall Street Journal, September 26, 1989,
p. B6).

The preparations for 1992 may, however, take the form of intra—European
mergers and acquisitions more than of acquisitions by U.S. firms.

A recent

report showed the value of mergers and acquisitions in Europe tripling between
1985 and 1986 and more than doubling again between 1986 and 1988 ("Europe's
Buyout Bulge," New York Times, November 5, 1989.

The coming elimination of

trade barriers was mentioned, for example, as a consideration in a recent bank

— 15

-

merger ("Germans to Buy Morgan Grenfell," New York Times, Nov. 28, 1989).
The major moves by the minority of large American firms that are not yet

well established in the EC may be more in the form of joint ventures, not
involving large new production facilities or financial investments.

A

possible prototype might be the recently announced venture between General
Mills and Nestlé to sell breakfast foods in Europe where General Mills' main
rival, the Kellog Company, is already entrenched as a producer.

The cost of

the joint venture is reported to be "... more in the tens of millions, not

in

the hundreds of millions... ," ("General Mills, Nestlé Plan Europe Push," New

York Times, December 1, 1989), an amount that would not show up as a major

investment flow or plant and equipment expenditure.
One of the surveys cited earlier found that 42 per cent of the companies

'... had launched a search for acquisitions or mergers and 41 a search for
joint ventures.. ." ("American Firms and Europe: Le défi is back," The Economist,
May 13, 1989).

That represents a very high proportion of joint ventures for

American companies, which have in the past strongly preferred 100 per cent or
at least majority ownership of foreign operations.

The frequent mention of

joint ventures in the press in the last few years suggests both that even very
large U.S. firms are reluctant to make the capital commitments implied by
wholly owned ventures and that much of the current activity in the EC represents the efforts of smaller companies, and companies less experienced in
foreign operations, to hold on to their shares in the EC market.

Another moti-

vation for joint ventures, even on the part of larger U.S. companies, may be
the opportunity to enter markets dominated by public procurement. as in the
case of an AT&T-Philips joint venture for the production of telecommunications
equipment (Peck, 1989, p. 297).

The nature of these activities --

joint

vefl

- 16

tures,

-

service and trade activities rather than large-scale manufacturing --

and the smaller average sizes of the firms involved, suggests that no very

large increases in investment or overseas employment are likely to result.
