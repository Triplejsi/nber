DOES LABOR SUPPLY EXPLAIN FLUCTUATIONS IN AVERAGE HOURS WORKED?

ABSTRACT

Economists have long debated over what labor supply has to do with
fluctuations in hours worked. This paper uses a time series of cross-sections
from the 1964-88 Current Population Surveys to study whether microeconomic
intertemporal substitution models can explain time series fluctuations in
annual averages. Conditional on a parametric trend, labor supply equations fit
the 1975-87 data remarkably well. But estimates for 1963-74 are not robust,
and estimated labor supply elasticities are much lower in the earlier period.

1. Introduction

Twenty years ago, Lucas and Rapping (1970) proposed that unemployment
be interpreted as a labor supply response to temporarily low wage rates.
Since then economists have continued to argue over what labor supply has to
do with fluctuations in employment and hours worked, most recently in the

debate over Real Business Cycle theory (Plosser 1989, Mankiw 1989). At a
minimum, intertemporal substitution theories such as that of Lucas and
Rapping require that wages and hours worked be positively correlated.
Recent evidence that wages are procyclical include the work of Bils (1985)

and Solon and Barsky (1988). On the other hand, Chirinko (1980), Ceary and
Kennan (1982), and others have argued that wages are noncyclical. Even if
wages are procyclical, the fact that hours rise when wages rise does not
mean that hours rise because wages rise.
In addition to wage cyclicality, the contemporary discussion of

intertemporal substitution appears to revolve around two issues. Some
authors have focused on the fraction of variance in hours worked that can

be explained by changes in wage rates. For example, in his recent survey
of the labor supply literature, Pencavel (1986) concludes that the
behavioral response to changing wage rates is a "second order effect".
Others have been concerned with whether labor supply models pass a variety

of specification tests. The ability of labor supply models to pass such
tests can be taken as a litmus test for whether labor supply explains

of

the variance in hours worked)
In this paper, a time series of cross-sections from the Current

Population Survey (CPS) is used to study whether microeconomic

1

intertemporal substitution models can explain time series fluctuations in

average hours worked. Labor supply equations are fit to annual averages
tabulated from each CE'S from 1963 through 1987. Paralleling the two
branches of argument over intertemporal substitution theories of the

business cycle, the empirical work has two components. First, real wages
are shown to be strongly procyclical between 1975 and 1987, but only weakly

procyclical or noncyclical between 1963 and 1974. Second, goodness-of-fit
tests are used to evaluate the labor supply interpretation of the
correlation between average hours worked and wages.
Section II outlines an econometric framework for the application of
microeconornic models to annual averages. The main point in this section is
that when individual observations are grouped into a fixed number of annual
averages, period effects must be excluded from the underlying microeconomic

equation. Thus, if period effects are found to be necessary in individual
labor supply equations, such equations cannot be used to explain movements

in annual averages. If period effects need not be included, however, they

may be used as instrumental variables. Use of period effects as
instrumental variables for a microeconomic model is the same as Ceneralized

Least Squares (OLS) on annual averages. Furthermore, the
overidentificatjon test associated with instrumental variables can be
interpreted as a test of goodness-of-fit of the microeconomic model to
annual averages.

Other issues raised in Section II include the possibility of
simultaneous equations bias in models fit to annual averages, the
implications of uncertainty in the micro model and random effects in the
aggregate model, and the implications of including only working men in the

2

estimating sample. Given the assumptions commonly invoked in life-cycle
models, there is no simultaneous equations bias in estimates based on

grouped data. Allowing for uncertainty or random effects does not change
this conclusion, although standard errors and test statistics are affected.

As is well known, restricting the sample to working men does bias labor
supply estimates, but in some circumstances consistent estimates can be
recovered simply by including aggregate macroeconomic variables as
regressors in equations for annual averages.

Section III presents graphical and statistical evidence on the labor

supply interpretation of movements in wages and hours. Conditional on a
quadratic trend, labor supply equations fit the 1975-87 data rather well.
But estimates for 1963-74 are not robust, and estimated labor supply
elasticities are generally much lower in the earlier period.
Estimation using data for 1963-74 is complicated by the lack of
information on hours and weeks worked, and annual hours worked must be

imputed for these years. Section IV presents evidence that aggregation of
the micro model eliminates most of the bias induced by the use of imputed
data in 1963-75, so that reduced procyclicality of wages in the earlier

period is not a consequence of measurement error in hours data. Section V
discusses labor supply equations with measures of aggregate demand included
as regressors, and Section VI offers a summary

and

conclusions.

II. Econometric Framework

Estimatin Life-Cycle Labor Supyly Models
In standard life-cycle theory, consumers are assumed to face a known

3

stream of wages and prices, and to maximize a lifetime utility function
that is intertemporally additive and additively separable in consumption

and leisure. Given these assumptions, current period labor supply or labor
earnings depends solely on contemporaneous wage rates and the time-

invariant marginal utility of lifetime wealth. In fact, for the purposes
of estimation, any time-invariant individual characteristics may be viewed

as being absorbed into a fixed effect. Life-cycle theory therefore
provides a parsimonious specification for empirical research.2
One commonly estimated life-cycle model is a log-linear equation for
hours, derived from the utility function discussed by Heckman and MaCurdy

(1980) and MaCurdy (1981). then the rate of time preference and the
interest rate are constant, the Heckinan and MaCurdy hours equation for
individual i at time t is (

—

i — 1,

.

. , N;

t —

1,...,

a1 + fi1(p-r)t + G1w +

T)

+ u1.,

(1)

where Ai is proportional to the log of i's time-invariant marginal utility
of wealth, r is the interest rate and p is the rate of time preference.

hi and

are the log of hours and wages, and l denotes the

intertemporal substitution elasticity.

As originally pointed out by MaCurdy (1981), equation (1) generates a
relationship between log hours and log earnings that may also be used to

estimate the labor supply elasticity. Adding 9hi to both sides of
equation (1) and dividing by (1+9) gives

hi —

+

2(p-r)t + (O/(1+92)]y + Ai + u2ie
4

(2)

where y is log earnings. Elasticities based on this equation have been
relabelled 2' and Ai includes 11(1+82]. Defining p — 921(1+82], we have
97 p/[l-s). Note that because the log of earnings equals log wages plus
log hours, equation (2) must be estimated by instrumental variables.

Most of the empirical work based on equations (1) and (2) uses panel
data to control for

which is necessarily correlated with wage rates.3

Bias from the unobserved

is usually eliminated by transformations such

as differencing or deviations from means, and bias from measurement error
is treated with instrumental variables.

In a survey of applied labor supply research, Ashenfelter (1984)
points out that the life-cycle framework may also be used to investigate
the ability of intertemporal substitution models to explain macroeconomic

fluctuations. Ashenfelter notes that because the only source of omitted
variables bias in (1) and (2) is the time-invariant Aj,

consistent

estimates of l or 921(1+92) may be tabulated by flitting (1) or (2) to

annual averages. For example, equation (1) is fit to annual averages by
estimating

Ashenfelter's point about annual

+

averages

+

(3)

(an observation also made by

Macurdy [1985]) is primarily a statistical one. Although 9 does capture
the response to a perfectly foreseen business cycle, life-cycle models are
not really formulated to explain responses to transitory wage changes.
Rather, 8 is meant to capture intertemporal substitution in response to
evolutionary wage changes over the life-cycle, say as a consequence of

human capital accumulation. Nevertheless, microeconometric evidence from

5

life-cycle models has been widely used to evaluate intertemporaj.

substitution theories of aggregate fluctuations (e.g., Card 1987, Mankiw

1989). The justification for this is that in models where wages are
uncertain, the impact of unforseen movements in wages on

is small

relative to the impact on contemporaneous wage rates (e.g., Altonji 1986).

The life-cycle model under uncertainty is therefore conceptually more
attractive for relating cyclical fluctuations to intertemporal

substitution. But for empirical strategies, the practical consequences of
uncertainty are rather minor. Therefore, most of the discussion that
follows uses the simpler framework of life-cycle labor supply under
certainty.

Angrist (1991) offers an instrumental variables interpretation of

grouped equations like (3). It is well known that the minimum variance
estimator for grouped data is a form of Generalized Least Squares (Prais

and Aitchison 1954). In the standard case where the micro residual is
homoscedastic, the GLS estimator is simply weighted least squares with

weights proportional to the group size. In Angrist (1991), the Prais and
Aitchison Generalized Least squares (CLS) estimates of an equation such as
(3) are shown to be Two-Stage Least Squares (TSLS) estimates, where the
instruments consist of dummy variables that indicate each period. Thus,
the key identifying assumption required for estimation using grouped data
is that there be no group effects in the ungrouped equation.4 If this
assumption is satisfied, grouping provides a means of controlling for time
invariant unobserved heterogeneity, and for eliminating bias from
measurement error in regressors.5
The TSLS interpretation of grouping also provides a simple framework

6

for evaluating whether equations such as (1) and (2) can explain cyclical

fluctuations, If the underlying micro model contains a period specific
intercept, then period effects will not be legitimate instrumental

variables. On the other hand, if period effects are legitimately excluded
from (1) and (2), possibly after conditioning on other macroeconomic
variables, then Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) or Generalized Least Squares

(GLS) estimates of the grouped equations will be consistent. The exclusion
of period effects may be formally tested using standard TSLS

over-

identification tests, which give a measure of the correlation between

instruments and residuals in the underlying microeconomic model. The test
may also be interpreted as measuring the goodness of fit of the micro model
to sample means.6

Simultaneous Ecuations Bias
In an equilibrium labor market, how can it be that least squares
estimates of equation (3) are consistent ?

The reason simultaneous

equations bias may be ignored in this model is that the agzre2ate supply

curve is assumed to be fixed over time. The only temporal variation in
average wages and hours comes from demand shocks that "trace out" the

aggregate supply curve. To see this more formally, assume that the
following equation characterizes firm f's demand for labor

S h. —

Thus, the fins' demand for hours is function of the total wage bill. In

this model average hours work demanded are

in period t.

is likely to be determined as part of equilibrium in a larger
system, but the level of average wages and hours is assumed to be

determined by equality of supply and demand. Therefore, the reduced form
for average wages is given by

—

'0

+

+

+

-

where 'cr w1 and '2 denote reduced form parameters and

is the reduced

form period effect.

Although the error term alt appears in both the grouped supply curve
and the reduced form for grouped wages, it is asymptotically negligible

when group size gets large. Intuitively, period effects in the reduced
form for wages can be thought of as the sole source of random error in the
model grouped into annual averages; there is no time series random error in

the grouped supply curve. Because the supply curve is fixed over time,
shifts in n identify intertemporal substitution elasticities.
It should be noted that the question of simultaneity bias turns on the
assumption that group sizes are large enough for a valid asymptotic

approximation. If group size is held fixed while the number of groups get
large, then it is clear from the reduced form for wages that regressor-

8

error correlation will not be asymptotically negligible. Furthermore,
asymptotics are done on the number of groups, group sample means no

when

longer

converge to population means. The sample means must then be treated as
mismeasured observations of the population means. Deaton (1985)

develops

this approach to grouped estimation, and offers formulas to correct
estimates and standard errors for attenuation bias from measurement error.

A Note on Random Effects and Uncertainty
The estimation of equations grouped into annual averages is justified
by the assumption that there are no period effects in the underlying micro
labor supply model, and therefore no period effects in the grouped

equation. An alternative specification adds an aggregate random effect
that is uncorrelated with average wages to the grouped equation. This
modification is attractive because the basic life-cycle model generates no

'macro residual". That is, population means should fit the grouped lifecycle model perfectly.

In an equilibrium labor market model, the random period effect must be

"tacked on to the equation for annual averages. Otherwise, if the period
effect is assumed to appear in the underlying microeconomic model, the same
period effect will appear in the reduced form for wages as appears in the

labor supply error term. Thus, the random effects model is an ad hoc
generalization of the model discussed above; average wages are determined
in equilibrium by equations (5) and (1), but the aggregate hours equation

has the form

— Mo +

+ fl1(p-r)t +

9

+ [e +

(3')

where

is asymptotically uncorrelated with the regressors in (3').

The assumption that

is asymptotically uncorrelated with wages

implies that CLS estimates of parameters in (3') will be consistent as both

T and N get large. But standard errors and test statistics must be revised
to take account of the fact that the variance of

is not negligible even

for very large N.

To keep the notation simple, assume that

constructed using time dummies as instruments are equivalent to GLS

estimates using a weighting matrix with (2 +

Therefore, the over-identification test statistic for the random effects
model (equal to the quadratic form minimized by GLS) is the overidentification test statistic for the model without random effects

multiplied by

Similarly, standard errors for parameters in the random effects model are
computed by multiplying the standard errors from the model without random
effects by w1•. An estimator for the numerator of €,,2 is the residual

variance reported by most TSLS software. The denominator may be estimated
by substituting the TSLS parameter estimates into equation (3') to compute
an average residual with variance equal to

+

(c2/n).

An alternative random effects-type model for grouped data can be

motivated by the life-cycle model with uncertainty. In MaCurdy's (1985)

10

version of the life-cycle model where consumers maximize expected

utility,

A obeys the following stochastic process;

Ai —

Ai1

+ b +

ei —

Aio

+

bt

where ei is a one-period forecast error. The parameter b is fixed when
interest rates and discount rates are assumed constant. The annual
of A

average

is therefore

A —À +bt÷z
i_api

where

is the average forecast error in period j. The term A0 may be

absorbed into the constant, and bt is the same trend as in the model with

certainty. Rut the sum

of

average forecast errors is a random effect that

becomes part of the grouped regression error.
In contrast to the case where an arbitrary random period effect is
tacked on,

the sum of

average forecast errors is clearly heteroscedastic.

The question of whether A. has a variance that is asymptotically negligible
turns on whether there is a common component in the individual forecast

errors. For example, when the errors are independent over i and the group
t
size is ntP then the variance of i

is just tr

of ei. Even here, the residual variance may not be

asymptotically negligible if the asymptotics are done on both nt and T.
A simple procedure for estimating the uncertainty model with
uncorrelated forecast errors is weighted least squares, where the weights

are equal to the inverse variances of the grouped residuals. That is, the

weights are given by c/n. where

This

is the variance of residuals in period

may be contrasted with the hoinoscedastic Prais and Aitchison
11

(1954) case, where the same 2 is used each period. As when the micro
residuals are homoscedastic, the more general weighted least squares

procedure is also a TSLS estimator. In this case, the TSLS equivalent of
grouping is White's (1982) optimally weighted TSLS estimator for
independent, not identically dIstributed samples.8

Sample

Selection

An important feature of labor supply behavior is the participation

decision. Because individuals who work are not a random sample of the
population, allowance should be made for the possibility of sample

selection bias. Beckman (1979) shows that a general solution to the
selection bias problem can be obtained by including the conditional mean of

the error term in an equation estimated using the selected sample. In the
micro labor supply model, the problem of sample selection is treated by
fitting

to individuals with positive hours and earnings, where E(ui.ISSR) denotes
the mean of the error term conditional on the Sample Selection Rule (SSR).
A consequence of equation (6) is that the sample selection can be

analyzed as a problem of missing regressors. Of particular interest here
is the question of whether sample selection induces a period effect in the

labor supply model. Suppose that the sample is selected according to
whether the expected wage exceeds the reservation wage, where the expected
wage is linear combination of variables,

and the reservation wage is a

linear combination of variables, X2. Then participation by individual i at

12

Following Olsen (1980), I assume that E(uijlvit) is a linear function
of "it' and that

linear function of

so that sample selection bias may be eliminated

simply by including additional regressors, Zfr If

has no time-varying

components, then sample selection does not induce a period effect in the

grouped model. On the other hand, if expected or reservation wages are a
function of aggregate labor market conditions, then the period mean of

will not be fixed. In this case, the parameters of labor supply equations
cannot usually be identified solely by time series variation in hours and
wages or hours and earnings.9

The need to control for sample selection may justify the inclusion of
demand side variables in the labor supply equation. 11am (1986), Card
(1987), and others have argued that one important implication of
equilibrium models is that suppliers obtain all the information they need

about the demand side of the market from equilibrium wage rates. According
to this view, nonzero coefficients on measures of aggregate labor market
conditions in individual labor supply equations should be taken as evidence

against the equilibrium hypothesis. But in the sample selection model,

13

demand side aggregates should be included in equilibrium labor supply
equations whenever these aggregates determine offered or reservation wages.
For example, if reservation wages are determined partly by unemployment
rates, these rates may appear as a regressors even though unemployment is
not a result of constraints on supply.1°

III. Intertemporal Substitution: 1963-87

Data
Data on earnings and hours worked from 1975-87 are drawn from March

CPS Public Use Tapes for 1976-88. Earnings data for 1963-74 are drawn from
the Mare-Winship Uniform Extracts of March CPS data for 1964-1975. The
sample is divided into two periods because the quality of information on

hours worked changes in 1976. From 1976 on, the March CPS records the
number of weeks worked and the usual hours worked per week in the year
preceding the survey year. For 1975-87, annual hours worked last year is
then estimated as the product of these two

variables.

Preceding the 1976

CPS, however, information on usual hours per week is not recorded, and
weeks worked are only recorded as a categorical variable with seven
11

categories.

For the purposes of estimation in the earlier period, annual hours
worked were imputed using two

approximations.

First, men were assigned the

midpoint of the category interval for weeks worked last year. For example,
men in category 1 worked 1-13 weeks and were assigned a value of 7.
Second, usual hours per week last year was replaced by actual hours worked

last jç. The first of these approximations is unsatisfactory because the

14

use of interval midpoints for categorical dependent

variables leads to

inconsistent estimates (Stewart 1983). The second approximation is poor
because the R2 from a regression of hours last week on usual hours last
year is only 0.15

12

Imputation of hours worked is also complicated by the fact

that there

are people with positive hours worked last year but no hours worked last

week. This is approximately 10% of men in 1976-88 CI'S's. Again a simple
approach to this problem was taken - men with hours last year who did not
work last week were discarded from the 1963-74

estimating sample.

To evaluate the consequences of imputation, data from 1976-88 were

used to compute both imputed and actual hours worked. The a2 from a
regression of log imputed hours on log actual hours is only 0.54 in a

regression with period effects. Average hourly earnings (wages) were also

computed from imputed hours worked. For log wages, the

is considerably

higher than for log hours, equal to 0.83. Imputed wages remain a noisy
signal, however and OLS estimates of coefficients on wages and earnings
reflect substantial measurement-error bias when tabulated using imputed

data. Nevertheless, the grouped estimates appear remarkably insensitive to
the use of imputed data. This fact is documented in Section IV, below.
Individuals sampled for the CPS are interviewed a total of 8 times
over a period of 16 months: one interview a month for four months,

eight

months without an interview, and again one interview a month for four
months. Thus, the CI'S sample is designed so that consecutive March Surveys
have a 50% overlap, with respondents who were in the sample 1-4 times as of
their first March Survey appearing the following year for sample months 5-

8. The reappearance of sampled individuals generates year to year

15

correlation in individual earnings and hours, inducing a nondiagonal

covariance matrix in data grouped into annual averages. The theoretical
structure of this covariance matrix is easily derived, but estimation of
the parameters in the covariance structure requires information from other

sources)3 To avoid the problems generated by a nondiagonal covariance
matrix, individuals in sample months 5-8 were simply discarded, so that the
remaining data points are independently distributed over both i and t.
The extracts used in estimation contain all 25-SO year old men in
sample months 1-4 with positive hours worked and positive wage and salary

earnings. Attention is focused on men aged 25-50 because results reported
below suggest that data for this group are most likely to fit the labor

supply model. Figure 1 plots the time series of real wages, hours worked
and labor force participation (defined here as having positive earnings).
An important feature of the labor force participation series is the five
percentage point increase in the fraction of the sample with positive

earnings between 1964-67. This apparent increase is an artifact of the
improvements in data collection procedures during the early years of the

CPS, and not a reflection of labor force behavior)4
As predicted by the intertemporal substitution hypothesis, Figure 1

shows that wages and hours move together in most of the later years. After
1967, labor force participation is also procyclical. In the earlier years,
however, wages appear only weakly procyclical or noncyclical.

Microeconomics with CrouDed Data
Figure 2 depicts the 1975-87 profiles of average hourly earnings and

hours worked for S-year cohorts aged 18-55 in 1976. For example, the solid

16

line at the left of the figure shows the 1975-87 earnings of men aged 18-23

in 1976. Lines for different cohorts exhibit different trends, but common
period shocks are apparent in patterns of deviation front trend, Of course,
different period shocks hit different cohorts at different ages.

A labor supply interpretation of the data in Figure 2 is presented in

Figure 3. Points plotted in Figure 3 were tabulated by removing a cohort
specific intercept and a cohort specific linear trend term from the average

wages and hours data plotted in Figure 2. A separate trend was removed
from averages for each five year age group. Thus, the slope of the line
drawn through the points corresponds to an estimate of

—

Oc

+

ei

in

alc_rt + 1ct + a1,

(9)

where the subscript c indexes cohorts. This is the grouped equivalent of
model (1) with a cohort specific trend, where instruments used to group the
micro model consist of year and cohort main effects and interactions.

Note that Oc in (9) captures the time-invariant cohort specific mean
of A1. Equation (9) is therefore a form of Analysis of Covariance based on
the removal of cohort fixed effects. This approach is an application of
Deaton's (1985) suggestion that panel data be formed from a time series of
cross-sections by following cohorts over time.
Figure 3 depicts an upward sloping relationship that seems to fit well

for data on the wages and hours of men aged 25-50. Different symbols are
used to distinguish the earnings of this middle group from the earnings of

younger and older men. Data points for the younger and older cohorts are
less likely to fall around the regression line (which has slope 0.46).

17

Labor supply estimates to accompany Figure 3 are reported in Table la.
This table reports estimates of equation (9) using data on the 1975-87
earnings of men aged 25-50 in 1976, while Table lb reports the

corresponding estimates for 1963-74. Both OLS and TSLS estimates are
reported -- as noted above, the instrument list for TSLS includes a full

set of year and cohort main effects and interactions. Therefore, even if
the underlying micro equation includes a period effect, labor supply
parameters in equation (9) are still identified, and so estimates with and
without period effects are shown.

Estimates of

are reported in column (1) of Table la. OLS estimates

of l are quite small, though significantly different from zero because of

the large sample size. For example, the OLS estimate of
period effects is 0.035 .

in a model with

TSLS estimates are substantially larger,

suggesting the presence of measurement error in the OLS estimates. The
overidentification test statistic for TSLS estimates of

in a model

without period effects is 160.7, and compared to a chi-square distribution

with 54 degrees of freedom this indicates a poor fit..15 Inclusion of
period effects improves the fit to the point where the model is accepted at

conventional levels of significance. Interestingly, the overidentification
test strongly suggests that period effects belong in the equation, but
estimates of

do not appear particularly sensitive to the presence of

period effects.

Estimates of 2 are reported in Column (2) of Table la. As usual,
these estimates are larger than the estimates of l' Again, the estimates
are not sensitive to the inclusion of period effects, although period

effects must be included to pass the overidentification test. Reasonably

18

precise elasticities in the range 0.3 -

0.8 are generated by models with

and without period effects.

Table lb reports estimates of equation (9) for 1963-74. As suggested
by the lack of procyclical wage movements in Figure 1, here the labor

supply model performs poorly. TSLS estimates of U are zero in a model
without period effects and negative in a model with period effects.
Estimates of 62 are positive, though not statistically different from zero

in the model with period effects. This is consistent with Solon and

Barskys (1988) finding of reduced cyclicality in earlier years. On the
other hand, a labor supply optimist might prefer the TSLS estimate of
from a model without period effects

97

this number is 0.357 with a standard

error of 0.075.

Macroeconomics
Estimation of equation (9) using data grouped by cohort and year is a

natural analog of fixed effects techniques for panel data. Of primary
interest here, however, is the question of whether labor supply models can
be used to explain year to year fluctuations in hours worked, without
controlling for cohort specific trends.

Table 2a reports estimates of equations (1) and (2) fit to annual

averages from 1975-87. The TSLS equivalent of this procedure is to use a
full

set of period dummies as instrumental variables. Three sets of

estimates are reported. The first shows results from equations with no
trend,

theoretically justified when the interest rate equals the rate of

time preference. The second and third sets of estimates are for equations

that include a linear and quadratic trend. Estimates are tabulated using

two separate samples. The first sample includes all men aged 25-SO in
1976, and is the same as the sample used to construct the estimates in

Table 1aJ6 In time series macroeconomics, however, it is not customary to
follow true cohorts, and results for a second sample including all men 25-

SO each year are also reported. Assuming there is no sample selection bias
and that labor supply parameters do not vary with age, these samples should
lead to the same (within sampling variance) parameter estimates.
Estimates of models without a trend, reported in column (1) of Table
2a, show that the simple correlation between hours and wages or earnings

for 1975-87 is positive. Overidentification test statistics lead to a
strong rejection of models without a trend, however, and the addition of a

one or two parameter trend substantially improves the fit. The trend is
more important for goodness of fit in models estimated with the sample of

men aged 25-50 each year. Remarkably, given the large sample size,
equation (2) estimated with a quadratic trend is close to passing the
overidentification test at conventional levels of significance (

critical value — 21.7
In models with a trend, estimates of 62 are all bigger than unity,

while estimates of 61 are range from 0.6 to 1.1 .

The elasticities are

generally largest in models with a quadratic trend. Parameter estimates
based on men aged 25-50 each year do not differ importantly from estimates
based on men aged 25-50 in 1976.

Table 2b shows results for annual averages for 1963-74. In contrast
to the later period, the raw correlation of hours and earnings or wages in

this period, reported in column (I), is zero or negative. Estimates of 61
using a linear trend are on the order of 0.3, and estimates of 2 using a

20

linear or quadratic trend are 0.37 to 0.79 .

But estimates of l using a

quadratic trend are negative, and the quadratic tern (not reported) has a

t-statistic around 3. On the other hand, the quadratic trend specification

may be rejected on relative goodness-of-fit groundsj7 As in Table 2, the
estimates do not appear sensitive to whether the sample is selected on the
basis of age in 1964 or age each year.

The estimates from specifications with a linear trend in Tables 2a and
2b are all larger than the TSLS linear trend estimates reported in Tables
la and lb for models grouped by cohort and year, and estimated without

period effects. This suggests that grouping data by cohort and year so as
to remove period effects has a cost: the reduction in group size that is a
consequence of finer grouping may lead to increased measurement error bias.
In fact, additional results (not reported) from experimentation with
alternative group sizes and classification schemes support this hypothesis.

Larger group size is usually associated with larger estimates of l and

The Imoact of Random Effects and Uncertainty on the Macro Estimates
In the discussion of Table I, it was noted that allowance for period
effects in a model grouped by cohort and year improves goodness-of-fit

without substantially affecting inferences regarding the magnitude of

intertemporal substitution. This suggests that random period effects may
provide a useful strategy for the analysis of grouped labor supply data.
Random period effects do not affect the consistency of estimates when the
number of periods gets large, but standard errors and test statistics must

be adjusted. The adjustment factor is the residual variance for the micro
model estimated using time dummies as instruments, divided by the group

21

size times the residual variance from the same model fit to annual
averages.

As an example, consider the model used to estimate

in column (3) of

Table 2a. The residual variance estimate for TSLS estimates using year
dummies as instruments is 0.641 .

Using the TSLS coefficients to compute a

residual from the 13 annual averages gives a residual variance of

0.0001748. The average group size is roughly 9,600. Therefore, the overidentification test statistic reported in Table 2a should be multiplied by

.6411(9600 * .0001748) —

.382.

The standard error in Table 2a should be multiplied by 1/1.382 —

1.62

This calculation is meant to be illustrative; 13 annual observations is not
enough to estimate the denominator of

very precisely. But the

calculation suggests that the test statistics reported for models with a
quadratic trend indicate a substantially better fit than would appear at

first blush. Similarly, standard errors are probably somewhat higher than
reported.

A similar conclusion regarding standard errors emerges when the

microeconomic life-cycle model allows for uncertainty. As noted in Section
II, the appropriate grouped data estimation strategy for models with

uncertain wages is weighted least squares on the group means. In this
case, the weights reflect the fact that the residual variance, as well as
the group size, differs across groups.

Using the TSLS estimate of

from Table 2a (for the sample of men

aged 25-50 in 1976, in a model with quadratic trend) to estimate residuals,

inferences. The test statistic in this example falls
32.7 to 29.3 .

uncertainty model, corresponding to Tables 2a and 2b, is reported in
Appendix Tables Al and A2.

Additional Results: Interest Rates and Education
Table 3 reports estimates for models that include real interest rates

as an additional regressor. When interest rates are not assumed constant
in the Heckxnan-Macurdy version of the life-cycle model, the parametric

trend should be augmented by the sum of all past rates. As an
approximation to this more general specification, contemporaneous interest
rates were included as regressors in the basic labor supply models.18 The
rate used here is the annualized real expected 3-month treasury bill rate

calculated by Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1990). The interest rate is treated
as endogenous, so that TSLS using time dummies is the same as fitting
annual averages.

The results in Table 3 are for the samples of men aged 25-50 in 1976

and men aged 25-50 in 1964. Models with interest rates lead inferences
similar to those arising in models without interest rates. For example,

the estimate of l in models with a linear trend and the interest rate
included as regressors is 0.530, whereas the same parameter is estimated to

be 0.581 when the interest rate is excluded. The goodness-of-fit statistic

23

is actually larger when the interest rate is included. Coefficients on the
interest rate vary from -0.544 to 0.632, although they are often not

statistically significant. It may be noted that macroeconomic Real
Business Cycle models suggest the interest rate should be positively
related to hours worked because when interest rates are high, current labor

supply has a bigger payoff than future labor supply. But the results in
Table 3 seem to support Mankiw's (1989) contention that interest rates and
labor supply are not systematically related.

Considerable information is lost in aggregate models such as those

discussed here. For example, it could be that spurious inferences are
generated when one group's hours are rising at fixed wage rates while

another's wages are rising with no change in hours. To check on this, the
analysis was repeated separately for men with different levels of

education. Tables 4a and 4b show estimates for models equivalent to those
in Table 2a and 2b, tabulated separately for men who did not finish high

school, high school graduates, and men with some college. The general
pattern found in Table 2 is replicated for each subgroup in Table 4. There
are substantial positive elasticities estimated in the more recent period,
while there appears to be little labor supply response in the earlier

period. Interestingly, the least educated sub-sample appears to have the
most elastic labor supply.

IV. Missing Data Problems for 1963-74

Data underlying the annual hours worked variable are of poorer quality

in 1963-74 than in 1975-87. Imputation of hours worked for 1963-74

24

undoubtedly adds measurement error to the dependent variable, log hours.
Measurement error is also added to the regressor in model (1), log

wages,

because wages are defined here to be the ratio of annual earnings to annual
hours worked.

To gauge the extent of bias in estimates for 1963-74, data from 198587 were used to calculate a variety of imputed wage and hours measures.
Estimates using imputed variables are then compared with estimates based on

the best available annual hours variable. The two imputations used in the
earlier period are the assignment of interval midpoints to categorical
weeks worked, and the substitution of actual hours worked last week for

usual hours per week last year. Combining the imputations with the best
available data, a total of five variables were constructed:

(1) weeks worked last year *

usual

hours/week last year

(2) Erouved weeks worked last year *

usual

hours/week last year

For the sample with positive hours last week only:

(3) weeks worked last year *

usual hours/week last year

(4) weeks worked last year * hours worked last week
(5) zrouved weeks worked last year * hours worked last week.

The hours measures range in quality from having no imputed input in
variable (1), used in Table 2, to the imputed hours variable, (5), used in

Table 2b. Variable (3) differs from variable (1) only in that the sample
is restricted to men with positive hours last week. It should be noted

25

that many researchers have also been concerned with the possibility of

measurement error in variable (l)J9 The maintained assumption here is
that grouping (instrumental variables) eliminates measurement error bias in

parameter estimates based on (1). We can then ask whether grouping also
eliminates bias in estimates based on variables (2)-(5).
0LS and TSLS estimates of

are reported in the first two rows of

Table Sa. All estimates are reported for the sample of men aged 25-50 in
1976 in a specification with a quadratic trend. OLS estimates appear
highly sensitive to the use of imputed hours, declining from 0.037 in

column (1) to -0.112 in column (4). Differences in the 0LS estimates are
highly significant. TSLS estimates decline from 0.94 in column (1) to 0.67
in column (5). Although larger in magnitude than the decline in OLS
estimates, the attenuation of TSLS estimates represents less than 30% of

the estimate in column (1). Furthermore, comparison of columns (1) and (3)
suggest that the decline in TSLS is entirely attributable to the

elimination of men with zero hours of work last week. Thus, the imputation
appears to induce selection bias; measurement error bias is eliminated by
the grouping procedure.

The lower half of Table Sa reports estimates of

OLS estimates do

not appear very sensitive to the use of imputed hours, moving from 0.44 to

0.28 as the imputation becomes increasingly crude, a decline of 35%. This
is not surprising given that model (2) puts all the measurement error on
the left hand side; there is no bias from classical measurement error in

dependent variables (Durbin 1954). TSLS estimates of 2 appear even less
sensitive to the use of imputed data, ranging from 1.3 to 0.95, a decline
of 25%, with most of the decline again attributable to sample selection.

26

Thus, imputation does not appear to explain the fact that estimates of
in the earlier period are roughly half as large as estimates for 1975-87.
As a final check on the estimates for 1963-74, Table Sb reports
estimates for both 1963-74 and 1975-87 from equations fit to weeks worked.

Estimates of

in Table Sb were tabulated by regressing the log of weeks

worked on the log of average weekly earnings. Estimates of

were

tabulated by regressing the log of weeks worked on annual earnings. For
the 1975-87 subsample, weeks worked were coded as the interval midpoints
for a categorical variable identical to that available in the earlier

period. Thus, estimates for the two period are based on identical measures
of labor supply. Elasticities in Table Sb for 1964-75 are all positive in
models with a trend. But estimates for the earlier period tend to be
around half as large as those for the later period.

It is interesting to contrast the elasticities in Table Sb with those

in Table 2a. For 1975-87, elasticities estimated using weeks worked are
roughly half of those estimated using hours worked. This suggests that a
substantial fraction of the labor supply response to changing wage rates is
in changing hours per week.2°

V. Labor Supply with Demand-Side Variables

Bias induced by conditioning on labor force participation may be
reduced by adding regressors from the sample selection rule to labor supply

models. This fact justifies the inclusion of "demand side" variables in
the labor supply equation and leads to an estimating equation for micro

data of the form

As a preliminary exploration of the empirical implications of equation

— the unemployment rate for all workers.

—

In addition to correcting for sample selection, the inclusion of
unemployment rates in labor supply models has been interpreted as a test of

labor market equilibrium.21 But as Pencavel (1986) and Card (1987) have
pointed out, even in equilibrium labor markets it is likely that the error
term in an hours equation will be correlated with other dimensions of the

same time-allocation problem. Furthermore, hours worked and hours
unemployed are linked by an identify that necessarily induces negative

correlation. One response to these criticisms is to look for instrumental
variables for unemployment, although there are no obviously attractive
candidates.

In the current context, the focus is not on whether #
what happens to

and

is

zero, but on

when unemployment is included in the estimating

equations. Inclusion of unemployment rates or other measures of aggregate
demand in labor supply regressions may be a simple strategy for reducing

the impact of sample selection on parameter estimates. As in the previous
analysis, time dummies as used as instrumental variables for all regressors
in the model, including the unemployment rate.

28

Table Ga reports estimates of equation (11) for versions with linear
and quadratic trends and the unemployment rate, and estimates for

regressions on annual earnings instead of wages. The sample is men aged
25-50 in each year, corresponding more closely to the type of data studied
by macroeconomists than the cohort samples.
As a bench mark, columns (1) and (2) show the estimates from models
with a linear trend that were previously reported in Table 2.

Columns (3)

and (4) report the results of adding the unemployment rate to these
equations, and columns (5) and (6) show the results of adding the
unemployment rate and a quadratic trend term.22

For

models with and

without the quadratic trend, addition of the unemployment rate causes

estimates of both l and

in 1975-87 to drop by over half. For 1963-74,

estimates of 61 in models with the unemployment rate are not statistically
different from zero, although the estimate of 62 is not substantially
reduced in the model with a quadratic trend.

The fact that estimated labor supply elasticities drop when
unemployment rates are included as regressors suggests that adding
unemployment to the labor supply model is not an effective control for

sample selection bias. This is because the theoretical consequence of

omitting E(u1.Z. >

is

negative bias in l and 2' so that estimated

labor supply elasticities should rise when

is included. To see why

sample selection is likely to induce negative bias, note that if hours are

high when labor force participation is high, then ui and Mit will be
negatively correlated. If wages are also high when labor force

participation is high, then w. and the omitted variable, E(u1iIZi >
will be negatively correlated as well.23

appear to fluctuate around unity, suggesting

that the relationship between hours of labor supply and unemployment rates

largely reflects the identity linking different types of hours. Not
surprisingly, inclusion of the unemployment rate improves the goodness-of-

fit of the grouped equations. Equations for 1915-87 that include the
unemployment rate easily pass the overidentification test at conventional

levels. Goodness-of-fit is also improved in the earlier period. In both
periods, inclusion of the unemployment rate causes the two

regressors. Columns (3) and (4) in Table Sb show stimates from a
specification with linear trend. The additional regressors do not lead to
any substantial change in either estimates of l or

estimate of l in the model with a linear trend estimated using the sample
of men aged 25-50 in 1915-87 Is Q.833 .

Column (1) of Table Sb shows that

this estimate increases trivially to 0.866 when the growth rate of Ml is

included as a regressor. Inclusion of the percent change in Ml, however;
does lead to a substantial Improvement in fit. On the other hand including
the growth rate of defense spending does not affect parameter estimates
very much or lead to an improvement in fit.

Results from a model that includes the growth rate of Ml along with a
quadratic trend are reported in columns (5) and (6) of Table Gb.

30

In this

specification, elasticities are larger, although the contrast with
specifications that exclude the growth rate of Ml is not statistically

significant. The models in columns (5) and (6) fit the data for 1975-87
quite well and lead to some of the largest elasticity estimates in the

paper. In fact, these are on the order of the representative estimate of
1.4 preferred by Lucas and Rapping (1970) in their work with aggregate

data. But it should be noted that the estimate of l

the earlier

period, which corresponds more closely to the period studied by Lucas and
Rapping, is zero.

VI. Summary and Conclusions

Does labor supply explain fluctuations in average hours worked ? I
began this project with the hope that labor supply models would either fit
the data well for the whole sample period, or that the labor supply
interpretation of fluctuations in annual hours would be decisively

rejected. Perhaps not surprisingly, the results support neither of these
conclusions unambiguously.

On the positive side, the estimates in Table la, based on cohort and
year groups, suggest that intertemporal substitution elasticities are
positive for 1975-87, and that labor supply models pass goodness-of-fit

tests when year dummies are included. Table 2a suggests that an important
component of aggregate movements in hours worked from 1975-87 is the labor

supply response to changing wages. The elasticities reported in Table 2a
are larger than many previously reported. For example, MaCurdy (1981) and
Altonji both report estimates on the order of 0.3 using a sample of men

31

from the PSID. On the other hand, estimates constructed using annual
averages from the PSID are closer to those found here, ranging from 0.6 to
0.8 (Angrist 1991).

The results for 1975-87 are robust to the specification of trend, and
models with a quadratic trend come close to passing the overidentification

test at conventional levels of significance. The quadratic trend models
pass these tests easily when allowance is made for uncorrelated, random

period effects or uncertainty.24 None of the estimates were found to be
sensitive to whether the sample analyzed was a true cohort or repeated

observations on the same age group. This is encouraging because
macroeconomists commonly apply representative agent models to samples of
the latter type.

In contrast to the generally favorable picture for 1975-87, the
estimates in Table 2b suggest that labor supply behavior is less important

in 1963-75, or that the models are misspecified for this period. TSLS
estimates of the coefficient on hourly wages are negative in models that

include a quadratic trend. Although the quadratic specifications may be
rejected on goodness-of-fit grounds, other labor supply elasticities
estimated for this period are also substantially less than those estimated
for 1975-87.

Detailed analysis in the rest of the paper supports these basic

findings. Many of the results are summarized in Table 7, which shows
partial R2's from unweighted time series regressions of average log wages

on average log hours and earnings. The sample contains all men aged 25-SO
each year. Movements in average wages account for a surprisingly large
fraction --

roughly

2/3 --

of

the variance in average hours worked between

32

1975 and 1987. The fraction of variance accounted for between 1963 and
1975 is considerably lower, and the importance of wages and earnings for

hours fluctuations from 1963-74 is disturbingly sensitive to the details of

model specification. Accounting for differences between estimates for the
two sample periods appears to be a natural candidate for future research.

Notes

1. Studies that test assumptions underlying intertemporal substitution
models include Abowd and Card (1987, 1989), Han (1986), and Ashenfelter (1984).
2. The assumption that future wages and prices are known is not
restrictive. When future wages and prices are uncertain and consumers
maximize expected utility, the log of the marginal utility of wealth is
(approximately) a random walk with drift (See, e.g., Altonji 1986), and may
still be eliminated by transformations such as differencing. The
implications of uncertainty for grouping strategies are explored below.
3. This includes the work of Ashenfelter and Ham (1979), Beckman and
MaCurdy (1980), MaCurdy (1981, 1985), Altonji (1986) and Abowd and Card
(1987, 1989).

4. Pakes (1983) also makes this point. An early grouping strategy for
estimating life-cycle labor supply models is Becker (1975), who groups a
single cross-section by age. Other references to the instrumental
variables interpretation of grouping are given by Angrist (1991).
S. Evidence on the extent of measurement error in labor market data has
been presented by Duncan and Hill (1985) for the PSID and Bound and Krueger
(1991) for the CPS. Solutions to the measurement error problem in panel
data are cataloged by Criliches and Hausman (1986).
6. A general reference on overi4entification testing is Newey (1985) or
Hausman (1984). In the case of dummy variable instruments for a bivariate
regression, the overidentification test may be interpreted as a test for
equality of all the linearly independent Wald (1940) estimates that can be
computed front I groups. See Angrist (1991) for details.

7. For models including trend terms, Durbin-Watson statistics show no
evidence of serially correlated residuals in regressions using annual averages.
8. The White (1982) weighting matrix is (1 — 2

z zic/N. where

is the

ith r9y of l The1optimally weighted TSLS estfmahr is
(X'Zfl Z'X) X'Zfl Z'y. In the case where Z consists of mutually exclusive
dummy 9riables, Q is easily seen to be a diagonal matrix with elements
(n/N)o . Substitution into the TSLS formula establishes the equivalence
to weighted least squares.

9. The exception is when the period mean of
is orthogonal to average
wages. As an empirical matter, the problem of sample selection may be
somewhat less important than the theoretical discussion would imply. Many
labor supply studies (including this one) are carried out using a sample of
prime age males. Few members of this sample report zero hours worked over
an entire year. More troubling, perhaps, is the practice of requiring
continuous employment in all years in studies using panel data (e.g.,
Barsky and Solon 1988). Thus, someone who is out of the labor force for a
single year, possibly because of sickness or schooling, is dropped from the
sample for all years.

10. Pencavel

(1986) offers a critique of the inclusion of aggregate
unemployment rates in labor supply equations as a test of equilibrium.
Heckman and MaCurdy (1988) discuss the complicating role of selection bias
in the use of microeconounic labor supply elasticities for macroeconomic
inferences. Card (1989) uses sample selection to justify the inclusion of
unemployment rates in labor supply equations.
11. Although certain variables are missing from the Mare-Winship Extracts
(most importantly, allocation flags), they are used for the earlier sample
because they are a source of CPS micro data for 1964-67. CPS Micro data
before 1964 are not available and CPS data for 1964-67 are not available
from the Census Bureau (Allen 1973). Because allocation flags for person's
wage and salary income are not included on Census Bureau tapes before 1972,
little is lost by using the more convenient Mare-Winship Extracts to form
consistent time series for 1963-75.

12. This

is from a regression that includes period effects.

13. What is required is an estimate of the year to year correlation in
individual hours and earnings. This information is available for a few
CPS's from extracts containing matched rotation groups.
14. The 1988 Economic Report of the President (page 290) shows a one
percentage point decline in labor force participation (as defined by the
Census Bureau) for men aged 20 and over in the same period. As noted
above, Allen (1973) documents problems with the early CPS tapes.

15. Degrees of freedom are calculated as follows. There are 65
instruments: 13 years of earnings * 5 cohorts — 65; there are 11
parameters: l' 4 cohort dummies plus intercept, and 5 linear trend terms.
16. The sample used in Table 2 and all subsequent tables differs slightly
from that in Table la in that it includes men for whom the Census Bureau
imputed earnings. Results were insensitive to this variation.
17. The ranking of overidentification test statistics here is somewhat
anomalous but theoretically possible. To see this, let Z be the matrix of
instr?ents, P be the projection matrix for Z, G be the TSLS residuals,2
and a be the ksidual variance. Then the test statistic is S — G'p G/c
(Hausman 1984). The numerator of S is necessarily smaller in the qJdratic
than in the linear trend specification, but the residual variance estimate
turns out to be substantially smaller as well.
18. The approximation may be rationalized by the assumption that people
behave each period as if past interest rates were constant, but
contemporaneous rates may differ.

19. See, e.g., Altonji (1986). Evidence that grouping eliminates
measurement error in estimates based on variable (I) is presented in
Angrist (1991).
20. Card (1989) provides a recent detailed analysis of the relationship
between wages, weeks worked per year, and hours worked per week.

21. See, e.g.. Ashenfelter and Ham (1979) and Ashenfelter (1980).
22. The unemployment rate is the civilian unemployment rate for all
workers on p. 293 of the 1988 Economic report of the President. The Ml
growth series, used below, is on p. 325. The growth of real expenditure on
national defense is derived from calender year levels on p. 403 of the 1989
Report for 1967-87, and from p. 345 of the 1986 Report for 1963-66.

23. A formal argument is as follows. Assuming that E(ulv) is linear and
is uniformly distributed on [0,11, we have

E(u1J Zi>vi) —

+ e1E(wiIziPvi)

is negatively correlated with

E(uiitl ZiNi) is e1c0Vw.z4). The covariance term is positive if
wages are also positively correlated with participation, so that sample
selection bias is negative.

24. Testing standards that account for sample size would accept models
with a linear trend as well. For example, Schwarz (1978) critical values
for these models are qln(n), where n is sample size and q is degrees of
freedom. Schwarz critical values for the models in table 2 are all greater
than 100.
