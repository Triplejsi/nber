PUBLIC POLICY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH:
DEVELOPING NEOCLASSICAL IMPLICATIONS

differences in national public policies which affect the incentives that
individuals have to accumulate capital in both its physical and human forms.
Our analysis shows that these incentive effects can induce large difference in
long run growth rates. Since many of the key tax rates are difficult to

Introduction

I.

Economists have long suspected that there is a link between national

long

policies and

term rates of economic growth.

For example, Schultz [1981]

suggests that many public policies contain disincentives for growth because
they reduce the rewards to accumulation of a comprehensive concept of capital
encompassing human as well as physical capital.

In this paper, ye show that

is shown to depend on the nature of the technology

The influence of policy on

the rate of return is a final factor affecting the growth rate.
Section IV

compares the

welfare effects of taxation in three economies:

basic neoclassical model, the simple endogenous growth model discussed in
Section II, and the growth model that we propose in section III. The main
conclusion obtained from this comparison is that there are larger welfare

due to Solo, [1956], Swan [1963), Cass [1965), and Koopmans

In this

paper we construct and evaluate a new neoclassical model that alters
intertemporal technology in ways which make sustainable growth a feasible
outcome when technology is time stationary.

Before developing our specific

model it is useful to briefly discuss stylized versions of old and new

we focus on economies in which the real interest rate is constant along

However, there may be a countervailing effect from the influence of taxation
on the cost of investing in human capital. If labor is the only input into
human capital investment and there is no direct taxation of the human capital
activity, as in Rosen [1976]. then p is simply proportional to (l_y)w, so
that there is a full offset on the relative price v/p and, thus, no effect on
the growth rate.

In the alternative specification studied by Hecknan (1976),

labor is only one of the factors employed in producing new human capital, so

of

capital investment good is independent
of the level of investment, since both of the production functions are
constant returns to scale. In discussing the implication of analogous
results for specialization in the production of traded goods in a world
economy, Baxter [1988) notes that they fundamentally derive from the
the human

nonsubstitution theorem" of Samuelsom [1961) and Mirrleeg [1969). In our

setting, since human capital is not traded, a small open economy will not
specialize if it grows, i.e., it will generally produce both final product
and human capital investment. But it still faces a price of investing in
human capital that is determined solely by domestic technology and taxes

Table 2 reports the results of some basic experiments with our small open
economy setup, which holds fixed the rate of return R(r). Prior to the
fiscal change, we assume that the economy has a growth rate of 2'!. and the
initial configuration of tax rates is r1Tf.2O. Further, we assume that the
economy does not trade with the rest of the world at these tax rates. We
then explore the ilications of increasing r1 to .3 and of increasing both

In our benchmark case, we assume the parameter values discussed in
section 111.1 above govern the economy. We also consider two other sets of

e1fare Ilicatioms of Taxation

In

the models

of

sections II and III we examined the effects on real

activity of an increase in the income tax rate from 20% to 30%.

In this

section we evaluate the predictions of our models for the welfare cost of
this tax increase.

Our objective is to illustrate the general principle that

there are larger welfare effects in endogenous growth models than in the
basic neoclassical model.

As in the previous sections we assume that the tax

proceeds are rebated in a lump—sum fashion in order to isolate the
substitution effects of taxation.

Method of policy analysis
The method that we employ is based on Lucas [1988a] and works as
follows.15

The Basic Ieoclassical Xodel

In response to an increase in the income tax rate from

to 30%, our

parameterized version of the neoclassical model predicts that steady—state
capital falls by 18.2% and consumption declines by

3.67..

As Judd [1987) and

Jorgenson and Yun [1988) have stressed, it is inappropriate to evaluate tax
policies solely on the basis of these long run effects. In fact the welfare
cost of taxation

would be independent of preferences in the neoclassical

growth model if only steady—state comparisons were utilized. However, the
decline in steady—state consumption gives us an upper bound to the welfare
cost associated with the tax increase.

Since consumption is higher along the

transition path than it is in the new steady state, the welfare cost is lower
than the cost associated with an immediate, permanent 3.6% drop in
consumption.
The first line of Table 4 shows that, taking into account the entire
transition path, the welfare cost of raising the income tax rate from

We studied the sensitivity of this welfare cost to intertemporal
elasticities of substitution different from the benchmark value of one.

When

the intertenporal elasticity of substitution in consumption is increased

is reduced), the initial. jump in consumption illustrated in Figure

The intuition behind these

results is familiar from discussions of the welfare cost of taxation in
partial equilibrium (e.g., Nusgrave and

Xusgrave

t1980), page 310)):

increasing the willingness of agents to substitute across goods increases
their response to the tax distortion and leads to a higher excess burden of
taxation.

Second, the effects of taxation depend importantly on aspects of the

production technology for new human capital, about which there is presently
insufficient information. In part, this reflects the fact that our human
capital good is a composite of many different activities and that we have not
taken a sufficiently precise stand on its essential content.

On the other

hand, there has been little research in labor economics since that of Rosen

Third, since policies have the potential to influence the growth rate in

with the results of the present paper, we find new promise

for the hypotheses of Schultz [1981) that incentive effects of policy can
influence economic activity—taxation can readily lead to development traps
and growth miracles.

Models of endogenous economic growth thus provide new

analytical paths for studying old problems in the economics of development.

'5This method is closely related to that used by Hamilton in his [1987]

of the effects of taxation on risk taking. Our measure of the welfare
effects of taxation would not be appropriate if we were addressing normative
questions such as the design of an optimal tax system, since we do not impose
that the tax revenue mist be the same in the two regimes compared. If this
restriction were imposed, our welfare measure would coincide with the
compensating variation used by Hamilton [1987] . We thank Ken Judd for making
