HEALTH, CHILDREN, AND ELDERLY LIVING ARRANGEMENTS: A
MULTIPERIOD-MULTINOMIAL PROBIT MODEL WITH UNOBSERVED HETEROGENEITY
AND AUTOCORRELATED ERRORS

ABSTRACT

This paper develops a general multiperiod-multinomial probit model for
panel

data to estimate the living arrangements of the elderly. The model
has the following features:
(a) In each period choices do not necessarily obey the assumption of
independence of irrelevant alternatives.
(b) Unobserved person-specific attributes are treated as random effects.
These random effects may also be correlated across alternatives.
(c) In addition, unobserved choice-specific utility components may persist
over some time, creating an autoregressive and/or heteroscedastic error
structure.

The model is estimated by simulating the choice probabilities in the
likelihood function. We examine several variants of the specification of
the correlation structure and investigate the extent the biases created by
ignoring intertemporal correlations.

1. INTRODUCTION
Decisions by the elderly with respect to their living arrangements

(e.g. living alone, living with children, or living in s nursing home)
seem best modelled ss a discrete choice problem in which the elderly view

certain choices as closer substitutes than others. For example, living
with children may more closely substitute for living independently than

living in an institution. Unobserved determinanta of living arrangements
at a point in time are, therefore, quite likely to be correlated. In the
parlance of discrete choice models this meana, that the assumption of inde-

pendence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) will be violated. Indeed, a number of recent studies of living arrangements of the elderly document the

violation of hA.1
In addition to relaxing the IIA assumption of no intratemporal correlation between unobserved determinants of competing living arrangements,
one should also relax the assumption of no intertemporal correlation of

such determinants. The assumption of no intertemporal correlation underlies most studies of living arrangements, particularly those estimated

with cross-section data. While cross section variation in household characteristics can provide important insights into the determinants of living
arrangements2, the living arrangement decision is clearly an intertemporal

choice and a potentially complicated one at that. Because of moving and
associated transactions costs, elderly households may stay longer in in-

appropriate living arrangements than they would absent such costs. In
turn, households may prospectively move into an institution "before it is

too late to cope with this change". That is, households may be subatantially out of long-run equilibrium if a cross-section survey interviews

them shortly before or after a move. Moreover, persona may acquire a taste
for certain types of living arrangements. Such habit formation introduces

state dependence. Ideally, therefore, living arrangement choicea ahould be
eatimated with panel data, with an appropriate econometric specification of
incertemporal linkages.

These intertemporal linkages include two components. The first component is the linkage through unobserved person-specific attributes, i.e.,

unobserved heterogeneity through time-invariant error components. An important example is health status, information on which is often missing or

unsatisfactory in household surveys. Health status varies over time, but
has an important person-specific, time-invariant component that influences

housing and living arrangement choices of the elderly. Panel data discrete
choice models that capture unobserved heterogeneity include Chamberlain's
(1984) conditional fixed effects estimator and one-factor random effect
models, such as those proposed by McFadden (1984, p.1434).
However, not all intertemporal correlation patterns in unobservables

can be captured by time-invariant error components. A second error component should, therefore, be included to control for time-varying disturbances, e.g. , an autoregressive error structure. Examples of the source

of error components that taper off over time are the above-mentioned cases

of prospective moves and habit formation. Similar effects on the error
structure arise when an elderly person, due to unmeasured transactions
costs, stays longer in a dwelling than he/she would in the absence of such
coats.

Ellwood and Kane (1988) and Edrach-Supan (1988) apply simple models to

capture dynamic features of the observed data. Ellwood and Kane (1988)
employ an exponential hazard model, while BOrsch-Supan (1988) uses a vari-

ety of simple Markov transition models. Neither approach captures both unobserved heterogeneity and autoregressive errors. In addition, living arrangement choices are multinomial by nature, ruling out univariate hazard

models. Bdrsch-Supan, Kotlikoff and Morris (1989) also fail to deal fully
with heterogeneous snd autoregressive unobservables. Their study attempts
to finesse these concerns by describing the multinomial-multiperiod choice

process as one lsrge discrete choice among all possible outcomes. By invoking the IIA-aasumption, a small subset of choices is sufficient to

identify the relevant parameters. This approach, that converts the problem
of repeated intertemporal choices to a static problem of choosing, ex-ante,
the time path of living arrangements is easily criticized both because of
the IIA-asaumption and the presumption that individuals decide in advance
their future living arrangements.

While researchers have recognized the need to estimate choice models

with unobserved determinants that are correlated across alternatives and
over time, they have been daunted by the high dimensional integration of

the associated likelihood functions. This paper uses a new simulation
method developed in BOrsch-Supan and Hajivasailiou (1990) to estimate the
likelihood functions of living arrangement choice models that range, in

their error structure, from the very simple to the highly complex. Compared with previous simulation estimators derived by McFadden (1989) and
Fakes and Pollard (1989), the new method is capable of dealing with complex

error structures with substantially less computation. The Barach-SupanHajivaaailiou method builds on recent progress in Monte-Carlo integration

techniques by Ceweke (1989) and Hajivassiliou and McFadden (1990). It
represents a revival of the Lerman and Manski (1981) procedure of approximating the likelihood function by simulated choice probabilities overcoming
its computational disadvantages.

The following section, 2, develops the general structure of the choice
probability integrals and spells out alternative correlation structures.
Section 3 presents the estimation procedure, termed simulated maximum

-4likelihood (SML). Section 4 describes our data, and Section 5 reports
results. Section 6 concludes with a summary of major findings.

2. ECONOMETRIC SPECIFICATIONS OF ALTERNATIVE ERROR PROCESSES
Let I be the number of discrete choices in each time period, and T be

the number of waves in the panel data. The space of possible outcomes is
the set of 1T different choice sequences (it), tl, . . ,T.

To structure this

discrete choice problem, we assume that in each period choices are made according to the random utility maximization hypothesis, i.e. ,2

i is chosen <—> u is maximal element in (ujt

j—l, .

. ,t),

(I)

where the utility of choice i in period t is the sum of a deterministic

utility component
variables

v(Xt,$), which depends on the vector of observable

and a parameter vector fi

to

be estimated, and a random utili-

ty component cit

—

v(XB)

+ c.

(2)

We model the deterministic utility component, v(Xt,/3), as simply the

linear combination Xfl.3
Since the optimal choice delivers maximum utility, it is not the utility level of the maximal choice, but rather the differences in utility
levels between the best choice and any other choice that is relevant for

the elderly's decision. The probability of a choice sequence (it) can,
therefore, be expressed as integrsls over the differences of the unobserved

utility components relative to the chosen alternative. Define

x T error differences are stacked in the vector w and have

For alternative i to be chosen, the error differences can be at most

Aj(iT) are particularly benign, the in-

tegral in (5) will not have a closed form. Closed-form solutions exist if
F is a member of the family of generalized extreme-value (CEV) distributions, e.g., the cross-sectional multinomial logit (MNL) or nested multinomial logit (NMNL) models, contributing to the popularity of these speci-

fications. Closed-form solutions also exist if these models are combined
with a one-factor random effect that is again extreme-value distributed
(e.g., McFadden, 1984).

CEV-type models have the disadvantage of relatively rigid correlation

structures. They cannot embed the more general intertemporal correlation
patterns exposited in the introduction. Concentrating on the first two moments, we assume a multivariate normal distribution of the

in (3),

characterized by a covariance matrix M which has (D+l) x D/2 -

1 sig-

nificant elements: the correlations among the wt and the variances except
one in order to scale the parameter vector j3 in the deterministic utility

components v(X,j3). This count represents many more covariance parameters

than CEV-type models can handle. Moreover, our specification of M is not
constrained by hierarchical structures as is the case in the class of
nested multinomial logit (NMNL) models.

-6-

We estimate this multiperiod-multinomial probit model with different
specifications of the covariance matrix M.

(A) The simplest specification M=I yields a pooled cross-sectional probit
model that is subject to the independence of irrelevant alternatives
(hA) restriction and ignores all intertemporal linkages. The D—(I-l)
x T dimensional integral of the choice probabilities factors into D
one-dimensional integrals.
There are several waya to introduce intertemporal linkages:
(B) A random-effect structure is imposed by specifying

it = ai

i.i.d. ,

+ lI,t,

i=l, .1-1.
.

This yields a blockdiagonal equi-correlation structure of M with (I-I)
parsmeters a(a) in M which need to be estimated. This structure allows
for a factorization of the integral in (5) in 1-1 T-dimensional blocks
which, in turn, can be reduced to one dimension because of the onefactor structure.
(C) An autoregressive error structure can be incorporated by specifying

=

+

i'j,

i.i.d. ,

i=l, . 1-1.
.

Again, this yields a blockdiagonal structure of H where each block has
the familisr structure of an AR(l) process. 1-1 parameters p in H
have to be estimsted.

(D) The lest two error structures can also be combined by specifying

6it —

Pi•'li

tl +

i.i.d. ,

1=1,..

1-1.

This amounts to overlaying the equi-corrrelation structure with the
AR(l) structure. It should be noted that a(a) and
are separately
identified only if p<l.

We now drop the hA assumption. There are several distinct possibilities,
depending on the intertemporal error specification.

(E) Starting again with (A) and ignoring any intertemporal structure, the
simplest possibility is to assume that the
t are uncorrelated across
t but have correlations across i which are coistant over time. With
the proper reordering of the elements in the stacked vector w, a simple
blockdiagonal structure of H emerges with T*(Il)dimensional blocks.
In this case (1-2) variances and (I-l)*(I-2)/2 covariances can be
identified.
(F) This specification can be overlayed with the random effects specification. This destroys the blockdiagonality although the one-factor

structure allows a reduction of the dimensionality of the integral in

practice, the identification of thia general specification may become
shaky when there is only a small number of sufficiently long spells in
different choices -

3. ESTIMATION PROCEDURE: SIMULATED MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD
The likelihood function corresponding to the general multiperiodmultinomial choice problem is the product of the choice probabilities (5):

N
L(fl,M) —

'r
n=l

P((itn)I(Xit,n);$M)

(6)

where the index n denotes an observation in a sample of N individuals, and
the c.d.f. F in (5) is assumed to be multivariate normal and characterized

by the covariance matrix N. Estimating the parameters in (6) is a forai-

-8dable task because it requires, in the most general case, for each observation and each iteration in the maximization process an evaluation of the

D=(Il)*T dimensional integral in (5).
One may be tempted to accept the efficiency losses due to an incorrect
specification of the error structure and simply ignore the correlations

that make the integral in (5) so hard to solve. However, unlike the linear
model, an incorrect specification of the covariance matrix of the errors M
biases not only the standard errors of the estimated coefficients, but also
the structural coefficients fi

themselves.

The linear case is very special

in isolating specification errors away from .

Numerical integration of the integral in (5) is computationally infeasible since the number of operations increases with the power of D, the

dimension of M. Approximation methods, such as the Clark-approximation
(Daganzo, 1981) or its variant proposed by Langdon (1984), are tractable --

their

number of operations increases quadratically with D -

but

they

remain unsatisfactory since their relatively large bias cannot be control-

led by increasing the number of observations. Rather, we simulate the

choice probabilities P((itn)I(XitnHfl,M) by drawing pseudo-random
realizations from the underlying error process.
The most straightforward simulation method is to simulate the choice

probabilities P((itn}I(Xitn);p,M) by observed frequencies (Lerman and
Manski, 1981):

P(ltn) —

Ntn(i)/Ntn,

(7)

where Ntn denotes the number of draws or replications for individual n at

period t, and

Ntn() — count( uitn is msximsl in (ujtn I j—1,

).

(9)

However, in order to obtain reasonably accurate estimates (7) of small

choice probabilities, a very large number of draws is required. That
results in unacceptably long computer runs.
We exploit instead en algorithm proposed by Ceweke (1989) which was
originally designed to compute random varistes from a multivariste trun-

cated normal distribution. This slgorithm is very quick and depends continuously on the parameters fi and N. One concern is that it fails to

deliver unbiased multivsriate truncated normal variates.4 However, as
Borsch-Supan and Hajivassiliou (1990) show, the algorithm can be used to

derive unbiased estimates of the choice probabilities. We sketch this
method in the remainder of this section.
Univariste truncsted normal variates can be drsw-n according to s
strsightforward application of the integral transform theorem: Let u be a

draw from a univariate standard uniform distribution, uc[O,l]. Then
e -

G(u)

1[ ((a)-(a)).u + (a)

is distributed N(0,1) s.t.

a univariste trun-

cated normal distribution is

'Z(z) -

t(a)

G(z) —

(11)

(s) - '1(b)
where '1 denotes the univariate normal cumulative distribution function.

Note that e is a continuously differentiable function of the truncation pa-

rameters a and b. This continuity is essential for computational effic iency.

In the multivsriate case, let L be the lower diagonal Cholesky factor

the covariance matrix M of the unobserved utility differences v in (3)

where the 0-dimensional vector a is defined by equation (4):

Because L is triangular, the restrictions in (13) are recursive. (For

etc.

Hence, each e, i—I,.. ,D, can be drawn using the univariate formula (10).

Finally, define

w — Le

Then (12) implies that w has covariance matrix H and is subject to

The probability for a choice sequence ttn1 of obaervation n is the
probability that w falls in the interval given by (4), which is the probability that e falls in the interval given by (13), i.e.,

(20)

Bdrsch-Supan and Hajivassiliou (1990) prove that P is an unbissed estimator
of P in spite of the failure of the Geweke algorithm to provide unbiased
expected values of e and w.

Like the univsriate case, the generated draws as well as the resulting
simulated probability of a choice sequence depend continuously and differentiably on the parameters $

in

the truncation vector a and the covariance

matrix H. Hence, conventional numerical methods such as one of the conjugate gradient methods or qusdratic hillclimbing can be used to solve the
first order conditions for maximizing the simulated likelihood function

This differs from the frequency simulator (7) that generates a discontinuous objective function with the associated numerical problems.

Moreover, as described by Borsch-Supan and Hajivassiliou (1990), the
choice probabilities are well approximated by (20) even for a small number

of replications, independent of the true choice probabilities. This is in

- 12

-

remarkable contrast to the Lerman/Manski ftequency simulatot that requires
that the number of teplications be inversely related to the true choice
probabilities. The Lerman/Manski. simulator thus requires a very large number of replications for small choice probabilities.

Finally it should be noted that the computational effort in the
simulation increases nearly linearly with the dimensionality of the integral in (5), D=(I-l)*T, since most computer time is involved in generat-

ing the univariate truncated normal draws.5 For reliable results it is
crucial to compute the cumulative normal distribution function and its in-

verse with high accuracy. The near-linearity permits applications to large
choice sets with a large number of panel waves.

4. DATA, VARIABLE DEFINITIONS, AND BASIC SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS
The paper employs data from the Survey of the Elderly collected by the

Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the Aged (HRCA). This survey is part of
an ongoing panel survey of elderly in Massachusetts that began in 1982.

Initially, the sample consisted of 4040 elderly, aged60 and above. In addition to the baseline interview in 1982, reinterviews were conducted in

1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987. The sample is stratified and consists of two

populations. The first population represents about 70 percent of the
sample and was drawit from a random selection of communities in Massa-

chusetts. This first subsample ia in itself highly stratified to produce
an overrepresentation of the very old. The second population that comprises the remaining 30 percent is drawn from elderly participants of the

27 Massachusetts home health care corporations. In the second population
the older old are also overrepresented. The sample selection criteria,
sampling procedures and exposure rates are described in more detail in
Morris et.al. (1987) and Kotlikoff and Morris (1987).

- 13

In

-

addition to basic demographic information collected in the baseline

interview, each wave of the HRCA panel contains questions about the elderly's current marital status, living arrangements, income, and number and

proximity of their children. The surveys pay particular attention to
health status, recording the presence and severity of diagnosed conditions
and determining an array of functional (dis-)abilities.
Table 1 presents the age distribution of the elderly at baseline in

1982. The average age is 78.5, 78 percent are age 75 or more, and 20 percent are age 85 or more. Among the U.S. noninstitutionalized population
aged 60 and over, 27.9 percent are age 75 or more, while only 5.5 percent

are over age 85. The overrepresentation of the oldest old in our sample is
indicated by the impressive number of 8 centenarians in our sample! Because the sample overrepresents the very old, it is also characterized by a

very large proportion of women. In 1982, 68.7 percent of the interviewed
elderly were female; by 1986, this percentage had risen to 70.7 percent.
The lower part of Table 1 provides information about family rela-

tionships and the isolation of some of the elderly. In 1982, 32.9 percent
of the elderly in the HRCA baseline sample were married and 55.0 percent

were widowed. Four years later, 26.7 percent of the surviving elderly were
married and 61.4 percent were widowed. As of 1986, 41.4 percent of the
elderly report no children, 15.2 one, 17.8 two, 12.7 three, and 12.8 per-

cent four or more children. Because the elderly in the sample are quite
old, some of their children are elderly themselves, and some children may

even have died earlier than their parents. A total 47.0 percent of the
elderly have siblings who are still alive; 25.5 percent of all elderly
report that they have no relatives alive at all; and 39.3 percent report
that they have no friends.
Average yearly income of the elderly rises between 1984 and 1986 from

- 1_4 $8,750 to $10500. This 20 percent increase is larger than the concomitant
growth in average income for the general population which was only 13.2

percent. It is interesting to note that elderly without children have a
significantly lower income ($7,500) than elderly with at least one child
($9,500) in 1984, although in 1986, this difference becomes smaller
($9,700 as opposed to $10,750).

One of the major strengths of the HRCA survey is its detailed informa-

tion on the health status of the elderly. Three kinds of health measures
are reported: a subjective health index, an array of diagnosed conditions,

and an array of functional ability measures. The subjective health index
(STJBJ) is coded "excellent" (1), "good" (2), "fair" (3), or "poor" (4).

The presence and severity of seven chronic illnesses are reported: cancer,
mental illness, diabetes, stroke, heart disease, hypertension, and

arthritis. Each of these illnesses are scored as: "not present" (0),
"present but does not cause limitation" (1), and "present and causes

limitation" (2). We condense this information in a summary measure,
ILLSTJM, the (unweighted) sum of all seven scores. Five measure-s of func-

tional ability are used: the distance an elderly person can walk or wheel,
whether an elderly person can take medication, can attend to his/her personal care, can prepare his/her own meals, and can do normal housework.
The first measure is scored from 0 to 5, representing mobility from "can

walk more than half mile" down to "confined to bed". The other measures
can attain five values, representing "could do on own", "needs some help
sometimes", "needs some help often", "needs considerable help", and "cannot

do at all" with associated scores from 0 to 4. Similar to the chronic
illnesses, we condense these indicators in a simple summary measures of
functional ability, ADLSTJM, the (unweighted) sum of all five scores.

Barsch-Supan, Kotlikoff and Morris (1989) discuss more sophisticated

- 15

-

measures, rhe correlation among the several measures of health sratus, and
their relative performance in predicting living arrangements. While the
subjective health rating performs poorly and is barely correlated with the
measures of functional ability and diagnosed conditions, ILLSUM and ADLSUM
are ss good in predicting living arrangement choices as more sophisticted
suismsry measures of health status.

Although the 1982 sample did not include institutionalized elderly,
subsequent surveys have followed the elderly as they moved, including moves

into and out of nursing homes. The type of institution was carefully recorded in the survey instrument. In addition, in each wave the noninstitutionalized elderly were asked who else was living in their home.
This provides the opportunity to estimate a quite general model of living
arrangement choice including the process of institutionalization, having
conditioned on not being institutionalized at the time of the first inter-

view. In the longitudinal analysis we distinguish three categories of
living arrangements:

(1) Indemendent living mrrsnsements: the elderly's household does not
contain any other person besides the elderly individual and his/her spouse,
if the elderly individual is married and his/her spouse lives with him/her.

(2) Shared living mrrsngements: the elderly's household contains at
least one other adult person beside the elderly individual and his/her
spouse. In most cmses, the household contains only the elderly, his/her
spouse, and the immediate family of one of his or her children, including s
child-in-law. Less frequently, the household also contains other related
or unrelated persons.
(3) Institutional living arrangements: This category includes elderly
who are living on a permanent basis in a health-care facility.

The institutional living arrangements category comprises the entire
spectrum ranging from hospitals and nursing homes to congregate housing and

boarding houses. Living arrsngements are reported as of the dsy of the interview - -

therefore,

temporary nursing home stays are not recorded unless

- 16

-

they happen to be at the time of interview. Rather, moat nuraing home
staya in our data aet repreaent permanent living arrangemenra.6 It ia important to keep this in mind when comparing the frequency and risk of
institutionalization in this paper with numbers in studies that focus on
short-term nursing home stays.

Table 2 presents the distributions of living arrangements in the five

waves of the HRCA panel. The frequencies in this table are strictly crosssectional and are based on all elderly who were living at the time of each
cross-section and for whom living arrangements were known.
Moat remarkable is the decreasing, but very high proportion of elderly
living independently in spite of the very old age of most of the elderly in

the sample. Approximately one out of every six elderly shares a household
with his or her own children, whereas very few elderly share a household

with distantly-related or unrelated persons. The dramatic increase over
time in the proportion of institutionalized living arrangements reflects

two effects that must be carefully distinguished. Institutionalization increases because the sample ages and health deteriorates as is obvious from

Table 2. This effect is confounded by the way the sample was drawn. In
1982, the sample is non-institutionalized by design. Only a few elderly
happened to become institutionalized between the time of the sample design

and the actual interview. Four years later, more than one fifth of the
surviving elderly live in an institution, almost all in a nursing home. As
of 1986, very few elderly live in the "new" forms of elderly housing, such
as congregate housing or continuing care retirement communities.
Table 3 examines the temporal evolution of living arrangements. It
enumerates all living arrangement sequences that are observed among the
1196 elderly whose living arrangements could be ascertained from 1982

through 1986. A little less than half (47.8 percent) of the elderly

- 17

-

maintain the aame living arrangement from 1982 through 1986. Another 21.0
percent died before 1986 without an obaerved living arrangement tranaition.
Thia atability confirma the results by Borsch-Supan (1988) and Ellwood and

Kane (1988). About 40 percent of the aampled elderly lived independently
from 1982 through 1986. Another 15.6 percent remained independent until
they died prior to 1986. Another 24.6 percent lived for at least some time
with their children, and 21.1 percent experienced at least one stay in an

institution. The most frequently observed transition is from living independently to being institutionalized. These sequences are observed for
42.4 percent of all elderly who change their living arrangement at least

once. Only 13.7 percent change from living independently to living with
their children. Most other sequences are very rare.

S. ESTIMATION RESULTS
For the longitudinal econometric analysis, we extract a small working
sample of 314 elderly who were interviewed in all five waves, whose living
arrangements could be ascertained in all five waves, and who have reliable

data on all covariates in all five waves. This results in a sample biased
toward the more healthy elderly. While we have not done so here, the
econometric model can easily be extended to accommodate sample truncation
due to exogenous factors, most importantly death and health-related in-

ability to conduct an interview. Table 4 presents a description of the
variables employed and the usual sample statistics of this subsample.
The presentation of results is organized according to four intertemporal specifications (pooled cross-sections, random effects, autoregressive errors, and random effects plus autoregressive errors) and two or

three specifications of correlation pattern across alternatives (the HA
assumption; correlation between random effects, if applicable; and the full

- 18
MN? model) .

-

Three replications (draws) were used to simulate the choice

probabilities entering the loglikelihood function. Using fewer replications produces less reliable results, but increasing the number of replication up to nine as we did for the final estimate does not change results in
any substantive way.

The goodness-of-fit in the various specifications is examined in Table

5. This table reports the value of the simulated loglikelihood function at
estimated parameter values and the pseudo-R2 associated with this

loglikelihood value.7 The cross-sectional estimates yield a pseudo-R2 of
more than 40 percent, a satisfactory fit for this kind of data. However,
introducing random effects in order to account for unobserved time-

invariant characteristics dramatically increases the fit. If shocks are
allowed to taper off in a first order autoregressive process rather than to

persist in form of a random effect, the fit is even better. Finally, the
tombination of random effects and the AR(l) structure yields significantly
better results than if either specification is employed separately.8
Clearly, the unobaerved utilities of this model include both time-invariant
and time-varying components.

Correlation across alternatives is also present. The full multinomial
probit specifications (rightmost numbers in Table 5, denoted by "MN?") fare

everywhere significantly better than the models that obey the hA assumption (leftmost numbers in Table 5, denoted by "ITA"). Inter-alternative
correlation appears to work through the contemporary error components rather than through the random effects, as can be seen by comparing the numbers
below "RE-Corr" with those below "MNP".
Detailed estimation results follow in Tables 6 through 9. These four
tables correspond to the four intertemporal specifications (pooled crosssections, random effects, autoregressive errors, and random effects plus

- 19

autoregressive

errors)

-

The two or three panels in each table pertain to

the correlation pattern across alternatives: the leftmost panel relate to

the hA assumption, the rightmost panel to a full MNP model. In the models
with random effects, the middle panel reports on the estimation with corre-

lated random effects. For each variable we measure (1) the relative influence on the likelihood of living alone relative to the likelihood of
becoming institutionalized (e.g., ACEI), and (2) the relative influence on
the likelihood of living with others relative to the likelihood of becoming
institutionalized (e.g., ACE2).

We first comment on the cross-sectional results, Table 6. Four variables describe the influence of demographic characteristics on the living

arrangement choices of the elderly person. Age oer ae decreases both the
likelihood of living alone and of living with othera relative to the
likelihood of becoming institutionalized, holding all other variables con-

stant, particularly health. Female elderly are more likely to live alone.
The number of children considerably increases the likelihood of a shared

living arrangement. These results are as expected. A surprising result,
however, is the insignificance of the indicator variable for being married.

Three variables measure health. While neither the subjective health
rating (denoted by "SUBJ") nor the score of diagnosed conditions (denoted

by "ILLSUN") predict living arrangement choces very well, the score of
functional ability (denoted by "ADLSUM") is by far the most significant

variable. The performance of the functional ability index confirms the
results of most health-oriented studies of institutionalization.9 The poor
performance of subjective health ratings in predicting living arrangement
choices is perhaps not so surprising given that this variable exhibits, on
average, very little change over time, iii spite of distinct changes over

time in average functional ability scores (see Table 4).

- 20

-

The results reveal a significant income effect. The higher the income
of the elderly person, the less likely they are to be institutionalized.
The direction of the income effect is in line with most previous atudiea,
although many studies fail to measure this income effect with much preci-

sion.10 It is quite difficult to construct a variable measuring the relative costs of ambulatory and institutional care for the included Massachu-

setts communities. Hence, there are no prices included in our estimation.
In the right panel of Table 6, two contemporary covariance terms are

estimated. The hA-assumption of the left panel is clearly rejected as can
be seen by the large difference in the loglikelihood values. The unobserved component in the utility of living independently exhibits significantly less variation than in the utility of the other two choices.

Note that the t-statics are measured around the null hypotheses a(v)=l,

corr(vLi)O for i"j, and relate to the following reparametrized values:
the t-statistic of a(v) refers to exp(u(v)), and the t-statistic of

corr(vw) refers to (exP(corr(vi.wj))-l)/(exP(corr(vv))+l). This
parametrization implicitly imposes the inequalities

and

tcorr(v.u)Il.
The coefficient estimates remain qualitatively unchanged when the hAassumption is dropped in favor of a cross-sectional, multinomial probit

analysis. However, some coefficients change their relative numerical magnitudea. The income effect, to take just one example, is strengthened relative to the influence of the measure of functional ability.

We now put the panel structure into place. Introduction of random effects (see Table 7) dramatically raises the pseudo-R2 to almost 60 percent.
Some of the time-invariant characteristics become less significant, while

the time-varying variables come out much stronger. Such an effect might
be expected because the time-varying variables have falsely captured some

- 21

effects

-

in each cross-section that are now attributed to the random ef-

fects. Note that time-invariant characteristics are identified in the random effects model as opposed to a fixed effects specification.

In Table 8, autoregressive error components link the different waves
instead of random effects. Finally, Table 9 reports on the full model,
where the random effects are augmented by two mutoregressive error com-

ponents. The autocorrelation coefficients

are highly significant, and

they drastically reduce the significance of the random effect terms in the

combined specification, Table 9. However, they do not replace the random
effects. While they are close to one, the large t-stacistica imply that
they are significantly different from one. In addition, the likelihood
ratio statistic shows a significant difference between the specification in

Table 9 with those in Tables 7 and 8. We conclude that the unobserved
utilities determining living arrangements of the elderly include both time-

invariant and time-varying components. The panel is too short, however, to
precisely separate the two error structures as is evident by the high standard errors of the random effect terms at the bottom of Table 9.
The demographic, health, and income variables are remarkably stable
across the different specifications of the covariance matrix, in spite of
their different fits in terms of achieved likelihood values and quite dif-

ferent numerical values of covariance elements. This stability pertains
both to alternative intertemporal and inter-alternative correlation pat-

terns. The likelihood of living independently decreases dramatically with
age, even after correcting for the decline in health and functional

ability, as measured by the variables "ADLSUM" and "ILLSUM". The gender
gap --

elderly

men are more likely to live in institutions, elderly women

are more likely to live independently -

- is

evident across all specifica-

tions. As opposed to other studies, elderly women are also more likely to

- 22

live

-

with children.11 The larger the number of living children, the more

probable is living together with one of them.

Among the health varimbles, the simple functional ability index

employed in this paper performs best. It is the most significant variable
in the model. In the presence of this variable, subjective health ratings
have no predictive power whatsoever. The simple index of diagnosed conditions is weakly significant, but a more detailed analysis of the included
illnesses may produce better results.

Finally, economics does matter. The income effect is measured precisely and robustly across all specifications. It is slightly underestimated in cross-sectional analysis, and slightly overestimated in the

pure random effects modelJ2 Those elderly with higher incomes choose institutions less frequently. Gauged by this willingness to spend income not
to enter an institution, institutions appear to be an inferior living ar-

rangement. The elderly's income may be spent on ambulatory care, thereby
making living independently feasible in spite of declining functional

ability. The ability to buy ambulatory services out of the elderly's income may also increase the likelihood of living with children rather than
becoming institutionalized because these services substitute some of the

burden that otherwise rests solely on the children. In addition, income
may be spent on avoiding institutionalization by making transfer payments
to children so that the children ate more willing to take in their

parents.13 The results also suggest that increasing income of the elderly
does not raise their probability of living alone relative to the probability of living with their children.

6. CONCLUDING REMARKS
The simulated likelihood method works well and requires a very small

- 23

-

number of replications. It easily accommodates highly complex error structures snd can handle different error structures without major programming
effort.

Two main conclusions follow from the estimation results. First, a
careful specification of the temporal error process dramatically improves

the fit. It also appears that ignoring intertemporal linkages does bias
some estimation results numerically, although the different specifications
produce qualitatively similar coefficients of the substantive parameters.
Second, living arrangements choices are predominantly governed by
functional ability, and, to a lesser degree (but still statistically snd

numerically significant) by age. The income effect is measured precisely
and robustly. Institutions are an inferior living arrangement as measured
by the willingness to spend income not to enter an institution. A somewhat
surprising result is that changes in marital status do not appear to matter

a great deal. The only supply factor that is included in our analysis, the
number of living children, is, as can be expected, a significant factor for
choosing shared living arrsngements.

There are several weak points in the statistical analysis. The
autoregressive specification "solves" the initial value problem by invoking

a stecionarity assumption. This is unsatisfactory, particularly with a
short panel, such as in this application. It is possible to estimate a
simple non-parametric specification of the initial value distribution, although in practice, the random effects should capture a great deal of these
effects.

The sample is selective because it includes only survivors. Whether
this ssmple selection is innocent in the sense of not biasing the estimsted

coefficients remain to be studied. There is no problem if the choice of a
living arrangement leaves mortality and morbidity probabilities unaffected.

- 24

If,

-

however, mortaliry and morbidity are, ceteris paribus, higher in nurs-

ing homes (e.g., because of inferior rreatment), there is a serious sample
selection problem.

Our panel of five wsves is short. The identification difficulties apparent in Table 9 are indicative of this short psnel length. However, the
dramatic differences in goodness-of-fit indicate that, even in a short
panel, the rewards for controlling for intertemporel linkages are quite
sizesble.

Three different specifications of correlations across
alternatives are employed, denoted by:

hA:

Independence of irrelevant alternatives imposed
i.e.,

RE-Corr: Random effects correlated

i.e., o(ma)O a(v1v)=O.
MNP:

Unobserved time-specific utility components correlated

i.e., a(w1v)O. a(mm)=O.
