DOES SCHOOL QUALITY MATTER? RETURNS TO EDUCATION AND THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES
ABSTRACT

This paper estimates the effects of school quality - - measured
by the
pupil-teacher ratio, the average term

length,

and the relative pay of

teachers -. on the rate of return to education for men born between
1920 and

1949. Using earnings data from the 1980 Census, we find that men who were
educated in states with higher quality schools have a higher return to
additional years of schooling, holding constant their current state of
residence, their state of birth, the average return to education in the

region where they currently reside, and other factors. A decrease in the
pupil-teacher ratio from 30 to 25, for example, is associated with a 0.4

percentage point increase in the rate of return to education. The estimated
relationship between the return to education and measures of

school quality

is similar for blacks and whites. Since improvements in school quality for
black students were mainly driven by political and judicial pressures, we
argue that the evidence for blacks reinforces a causal interpretation of the
link between school quality and earnings. We also find that returns to
schooling are higher for students educated in states with a higher fraction
of female teachers, and in states with higher average teacher education.
Holding constant school quality measures, however, we find no evidence that

parental income or education affects state-level rates of return.

Beginning with the highly influential Coleman Report (1966), researchers
have found little, if any, association between the quality of schools and
student achievement on standardized tests (see Hanushek (1986) for a recent

survey). On the basis of these findings it is now widely argued that
increa :5

in

public school funding have few important benefits for students.

This conclusion, although currently politically popular, contradicts two other

strands of evidence on the quality of schooling. On one hand, the small
number of studies that have directly correlated school

quality and earnings

have found a significantly positive relationship between them (Morgan and
Sirageldin (1968), Welch (1969), Johnson and Stafford (1973), Wachtel (1976)).

On the other hand, a widely-cited series of studies has identified
improvements in the relative quality of black schooling as an important factor
in the narrowing of the black/white wage gap (Welch (1966, 1967, 1973a,
1973b), Freeman (1973), Smith and Welch (1989)).

There are several explanations for the conflicting evidence. Most
studies of earnings and school quality focus on the correlation between school
characteristics (typically per-capita expenditure) and the mean earnings of

students educated in a school district. One

can easily argue that family

background variables affect both educational expenditures and labor market

earnings. In this case, the correlation of school quality and earnings is

potentially spurious) From the opposite perspective, however, one can argue
that test scores are an imperfect measure of school performance. Indeed,
although earnings and test scores are correlated, they are by no means

exception is Wachtel's (1976) study of the earnings of air force
veterans, which controls for father's education.

market achievement (e.g. ,

of school training that affect subsequent labor

discipline)

may be poorly measured by test scores.

Furthermore, the relation between school quality and test scores measured when
students are in the eighth or twelfth grade fails to capture any effects of
school quality on subsequent schooling achievement.

This paper presents an extensive analysis of the relation between

earnings and school quality for cohorts of men born between 1920 and 1949. We
use the relatively large samples available from the 1980 Census to estimate

rates of return to education by state-of-birth and cohort. We then relate
rates of return to schooling to objective measures of school quality,

including pupil-teacher ratios, relative wages of teachers, and the duration
of the school term.3
Our procedures overcome at least some of the objections to earlier

studies of earnings and school quality. First, our statistical models include
unrestricted state-of-birth effects, and therefore control for any differences

in the mean earnings of men born in different states. To the extent that
differences in family background raise or lower earnings for all levels of
schooling attainment, our estimated rates of return are purged of any effects

of differential family background. Second, we control for systematic
differences in the returns to education associated with an individual's

current region of residence. We thereby eliminate relative supply or demand
2For example, the addition of test score information to the log-earnings
regressions reported by Griliches and Mason (1972, Table 3) improves the
explanatory power of their regressions by less than 0.5 percentage point.
3Our approach is conceptually similar to that of Behrman and Birdsall
(1983), who relate the returns to schooling among young Brazilian men to the
average years of education of teachers in each individual's region of
residence.

effects chat raise or lower the returns to education in different parts of the

country. Finally, in much of our analysis we incorporate permanent statespecific effects in the return to education, and use only the within-state
variation among birth cohorts to identify the effects of school quality on the
returns to education.

The results indicate that there is substantial variation in the rate of
return to education across individuals educated in different states and at

different times. Much of this variation is related to differences in the
quality of schooling. We find that rates of return are systematically higher
for individuals who attended schools with lower pupil-teacher ratios and

higher relative teacher salaries. For example, our estimates suggest that a
decrease in the pupil-teacher ratio by 5 students is associated with a 0.4

percentage point increase in the rate of return to schooling. Similarly, a 10
percent increase in teachers' pay is associated with a 0.1 percentage point

increase in the rate of return to schooling. We also find that returns are
linked to higher education among teachers. Controlling for measures of school
quality, however, we find no evidence that returns to education are related to
the income or schooling levels of the parents' generation, or to the fraction
of students who graduate from high school or college.

Our main results are obtained for samples of white men. In view of the
remarkable growth in school quality for black students during the past 70
years, however, the effects of school quality are of particular interest for

blacks.4 Comparative data for the segregated Southern school systems confirm

4See Welch (1967, l973a, 1973b) and Freeman (1973), for example.
Contemporary observers throughout the early 20th century consistently stressed
improvements in the quality of education for blacks as a key to their economic
progress. See, for example, Bond (1934).

that measures of school quality were significantly lower for black students in

the 1920's and 1930's. By the early 1950's, however, most states had reduced
or even eliminated the gap in measured quality. These rapid changes provide a
unique and arguably exogenous experiment with which to evaluate the effects of

school quality.5 Perhaps surprisingly, the measured relationship between
school quality and returns to education is very similar for blacks and whites,
providing more support for a causal interpretation of our estimates.

I. Empirical Framework

Our goal is to relate the returns to education earned by individuals
educated in different states to the characteristics of the public school

system during the time they attended school. To describe the empirical
framework, it is useful to assume that individuals attend school in their

state of birth. (Procedures that adjust for the interstate mobility of preschool and school-age children are developed in section HId, below)

Let

represent the logarithm of weekly earnings for individual i, born in
state j in cohort c and currently living in state k, and let

Eijkc represent

the years of education attained by individual i. We assume that earnings are

consists of two additive components: a cohort-by-state-of-birth component

Notice that by including an interaction between individuals' state of
birth and education, and an interaction between individuals' current region of
residence and education, the state-of-birth-specific contribution to the
return to education is identified by individuals who are educated in one state

and move to another region. It is the shift in the return to education
attributable to schooling in a particular State that we seek to explain by
differences in school quality across states and over time.

Specifically, we hypothesize that the state-of-birth component of the
return to education depends on the quality of the education system in the
state when the cohort attended school, on an aggregate cohort effect, and
possibly on a Set of state-specific effects that are invariant across cohorts:

6Although there is a substantial literature on possible unobservedbias for estimates of the return to education, we
assume that unobserved variables are not correlated with years of education,
conditional on the other variables in the equation. We make this assumption
to keep the estimation tractable, and because we focus on school quality,
which itself is an unobservable in most studies of the return to education.

In this specification,

any permanent differences in the returns to education, arising (for example)
from differences in the distributions of ability across states, are absorbed
by the state-of-birth effects, a., in (2).

Under these assumptions, the effects of a particular measure of education
quality can be obtained in one step by estimating a conventional log-linear
earnings function that includes state-of-birth dummies, state-of-residence
dummies, interactions of region of residence with education, and interactions
of education with the quality measures for state j and cohort c.8
Alternatively, one can proceed in two steps: first, estimate the average rate
of return to education for individuals born in cohort c in state j,

controlling for state-of-birth, state-of-residence, and any geographic
differences in the return to education; and then use a second-stage regression
to relate estimated rates of return to observed quality variables.
In this paper we employ both estimation strategies, although we

concentrate on the two-step approach. A two-step procedure provides a
convenient reduction of the data, and allows us to illustrate the diversity of

returns to education and their relation to measures of school quality. It
also facilitates a relatively simple correction for interstate mobility of

pre-school children. Nevertheless, in a two-step procedure cohorts must be
defined fairly broadly to obtain reliable estimates of the state- and cohort-

specific returns to education. In the analysis below we use 10-year intervals

aggregation

eliminates any within-cohort variation in either

school-quality or rates of return to education, and may potentially limit our
ability to estimate the effects of school quality on the returns to schooling.
By comparison, the one-step estimates that we present have the advantage that
cohort-groups are defined quite narrowly: by year-of-birth.

a. Functional Form
The assumption of a linear relation between schooling and (log) earnings
is widely used in applied studies of earnings, and is often found to perform
as well as or better than simple alternatives.9 However, most studies pool
samples of individuals from different States and birth cohorts with no

allowance for regional or cohort differences in returns. It is conceivable
(and indeed roughly true) that the log earnings-schooling relation is
approximately linear in pooled samples, but is non-linear for particular sub-

samples. It is also conceivable that changes in the quality of public
schooling shift the returns to elementary or secondary education more (or

less) than the returns to college. If so, then the specification of the
return-to-education function should allow for kinks at 12 years of education.

In an effort to obtain some simple evidence on these issues we estimated
a series of unrestricted earnings-schooling models on narrowly defined sub-

samples of individuals in the 1980 Census. These models include a complete
set of.dununy variables for 0 through 20 years of education, as well as

controls for potential labor market experience, marital status, state of

semi-logarithmic earnings-schooling model against other specifications by

residence, and residence in an SMSA.10 Figure 1 graphs the estimated
education coefficients for 9 of the sub-samples: three cohorts of white men
born in Alabama or Georgia (1920-29, 1930-39, and 1940-49), three cohorts of
white men born in California, and three cohorts of black men born in Alabama,

Georgia, South Carolina, or Mississippi. Figure 2 graphs the estimated
schooling coefficients (together with their standard error bounds) for
national samples of white men in the three birth cohorts.

These figures illustrate three general findings. First, for a particular
cohort and state-of-birth group, the earnings-education relation is
approximately log-linear for levels of education above a minimum threshold.

Although there is some evidence of a college graduation effect, departures
from log-linearity above the threshold level are small.

Second, the threshold

education level varies widely across states and over time within states, being
relatively lower for older cohorts and for individuals from states with lower

average educational attainment, and lower for blacks than for whites. This
phenomenon is evident even in the national samples in Figure 2: the threshold
is at 2 years of education for whites born between 1920 and 1929, at 3 years

of education for those born during 1930-39, and at 5 years for those born in

1940.49. Finally, the rate of return to education (for years of education
above the threshold level) is higher for later cohorts: especially so for
blacks -

The positive correlation between the average educational attainment of a
state-of-birth and cohort group and the threshold point in their return-toeducation function led us to investigate the determinants of this threshold

more carefully. For each of 13 larger states (or pairs of contiguous states)
and each of three 10-year birth cohorts, we first estimated a non-parametric
version of the return-to-education function (using 20 unrestricted dummy
variables) and found the approximate threshold point in the return-to-

education relation. We then compared this point to various percentiles of the
education distribution in each state-cohort group. This comparison led us to
a simple empirical relation: across different cohorts and states-of-birth, and
different race groups, the threshold point corresponds approximately to the
grade level attained by the second percentile of the education distribution of

workers. For example, a simple linear regression of the estimated threshold
point on the grade attained by the second percentile of the education
distribution has an estimated coefficient of .88, with an estimated standard
error of .13 and an R-squared of .57.

11

The approximate linearity of the returns functions in Figure 1 suggests
that states and cohorts with higher returns to elementary and secondary

schooling have higher returns to post-secondary education. Indeed, in the
sub-sample of 13 states and 3 birth cohorts the earnings gap between
individuals with 8 and 12 years of completed education is positively
correlated with the earnings gap between individuals with 12 and 16 years of

education. This suggests that improvements in the quality of elementary and
secondary education increase the returns to post-secondary education as well

as the returns to the first 12 years of schooling. We present further
evidence on this question in section V below.
Given the pattern of the non-parametric estimates of the return-toeducation function for the larger states, in the remainder of the paper we

II. Measures of the quality of Pu i.c Schooling
Since the late nineteenth century the U.S. Office of Education has
regularly published a summary of the characteristics of the public school

systems in each state, These data are available on a semi-annual basis from
1918 to 1958 in the gjennjal Survey of Education, and annually since 1960 in

the Dizesc of Education Statistics. The Office of Education tabulates the
results of questionnaires sent to the state offices of education inquiring
about state-wide enrollment, revenues, number of teaching positions, length of

school term, average teacher salaries, and other variables. Prior to 1954,

11

data are available separately for the white and black school systems in states
that operated segregated schools.

The Biennial Survey of Education is a rich source of information on the
average characteristics of public schools in different states at different

points in time. From the available data we have collected information on
three main characteristics: the ratio of enrolled students to instructional
staff in the state ("pupil-teacher ratio"), the average length of the school
12

We hypothesize

term ("term length"), and average annual teacher salaries.

that increases in term length increase the amount of material covered in a
school year, and thereby increase the economic value of additional years of

schooling. We similarly hypothesize that reductions in the pupil-teacher
ratio improve the quality of classroom instruction and lead to higher returns

for each year of completed education. Finally, we hypothesize that higher
teacher salaries enable schools to attract and retain more-qualified teachers,

leading to improved classroom instruction and higher returns to education.13
Several previous authors, including Morgan and Sirageldin (1968), Johnson
and Stafford (1973), and Wachtel (1976), have used total expenditures per

pupil as an index of school quality. We suspect that the quality of education
is more directly linked to indexes of pupil-teacher ratios and teacher
salaries than to total expenditures per pupil, and indeed this is suggested by

the results in Welch (1966). Nevertheless, roughly 60 percent of total

.

As a check on the quality of the salary data in the BLennl.al Survey, we

compared average teacher wages for each state in the 1939-40 Biennial Survey
to state-specific averages of annual salaries for teachers in the 1940 Census.
We also compared average wages of teachers in the 1959-60 Biennial Survey to
state-specific averages of annual earnings for teachers in the 1960 Census.
In each case the correlation across states was over 0.95.

12

education expenditures are for instructional salaries.14 Since the per capita
expenditure on instructional salaries is simply the ratio of the average
teacher wage to the pupil-teacher ratio, differences in teacher salaries and
pupil-teacher ratios account for much of the variation in total expenditures
per pupil.

Given geographic differences in the Cost of living and in the level of
alternative wages available to potential teachers, it seems unlikely that the
level of teacher wages is an adequate index of teacher quality in different

states. We have therefore normalized teacher wages in each state by the level
of average wages in the state. We use average weekly earnings of employees
covered by the Social Security system to adjust wage rates from 1940 onward.
Due to a paucity of state-wide wage data prior to 1940, we use a regional wage
rate for workers on federal construction projects to normalize average teacher

salaries. The comparison wage series are index-linked between 1940 and 1944
as described in Appendix A. In view of the changing coverage of the Social
Security wage index, and given the necessity of index-linking disparate wage
series, we prefer to remove the time trends in the average relative teacher

salary in our sample period. We therefore divide the relative teacher wage
for each state by the national average of this ratio in the same year. This
second normalization eliminates any time-series variability in the average
value of relative teacher salaries, while preserving the cross-sectional
information on relative teacher wages at a point in time.

A summary of these three measures of school quality is presented in Table

1. We present average values of the quality measures by state for three

different cohorts of students: those born between 1920 and 1929, those born

between 1930 and 1939, and those born between 1940 and 1949. The averages for
a cohort assume that each person attends public school for 12 years, and that

the number of individuals born per year in any cohort is constant. The
quality measures for each year of school attended are weighted equally. We
have also computed the averages using individual-specific years of education
for men born in these cohorts and obtained virtually identical averages.15
The data in Table 1 show substantial variation in education "quality"

across states. For the 1920-29 birth cohort, pupil-teacher ratios range from
20 (in the Dakotas, Montana, and Wyoming) to over 35 (in Arkansas, Mississippi

and North Carolina). Average term lengths for this cohort range from 139 days
(in Mississippi) to over 180 days (in the mid-Atlantic states). Similarly,
relative teacher wages range from 0.75 or lower (in many Southern states) to

over 1.25 (in many Northeastern states). As one might expect, the interstate
variation in our three measures of education quality is much lower for the

later cohorts. This is particularly true of the term length variable, which
falls in a very narrow range for the latest cohort.

The patterns of quality variation over time within individual states also

vary widely. Most of the Southern states show uniform improvements in
quality. Other states, such as Michigan and Missouri, show almost no change
in the, quality variables, while some states show declines in certain

dimensions of quality. The differences are most pronounced for relative
teacher wages. For example, teachers in Alabama and Georgia show strong

relative wage gains, while teachers in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York
show relative wage losses during the period.

III. Returns to Education by

Cohort and State of Birth for White Males

In this section we present estimates of the average rates of return to

education for white men born in the 48 mainland states and the District of

Columbia between 1920 and 1949. We divide the samples of men born in these
states into three 10-year birth cohorts, and estimate rates of return for 147

separate state and cohort groups. We then perform a second-stage analysis of
the relation between rates of return to schooling and the measures of school
quality in Table 1.

We also explore the effects of additional characteristics

of the school systems in each state, and contrast these to the effects of some

simple measures of family background. Finally, we present the results of a
simple correction for the 'measurement errors induced by the interstate
mobility of pre-school and school-age children.

a. Rates of Return to Education by State and Cohort
Our estimated rates of return to education are obtained from three
cohort-specific regressions fitted to individual data on log weekly earnings

for 1979. The data samples are taken from the 5 Percent Public Use A-Sample
of the. 1980 Census (see Appendix B for details) .

Following

the specification

of equation (1), the explanatory variables in each regression include a set of

50 indicator variables for an individual's current state of residence (Mk) a
set of 48 indicator variables for an individual's state of birth (5.), and

controls for potential experience and its square, marital status, and

residence within an SMSA. To control for any differences in the current rate

15

of return to education across different labor markets in the country, the
models also include interactions between 9 current region-of-residence dummies

and completed education.16 Finally, the models include state-of-birth.
specific interactions with individual education, where, as described in
Section 1, individual education is modelled as the maximum of zero, and years
of education over and above the years of schooling attained by the second

percentile of the education distribution in an individuals state-of-birth and
cohort. These interactions are interpreted as estimates of the rate of return
to education for individuals from a particular cohort and state.

The estimated rates of return (times 100), together with their estimated

standard errors, are presented in Table 2. The lower panel of the table
reports the weighted means and standard deviations of the estimated returns
across the 49 states, and the weighted correlations between the returns and

cohort-specific quality measures. Despite the fact that the estimates are
obtained from highly parameterized models (there are 158 explanatory variables
in the regression equation for each cohort) ,

the estimates are relatively

precise, with standard errors in the range of .1 to .3 percent for most

states. As the information in Figures 1 and 2 suggests, rates of return to
education are much lower for older workers: 5.1 percent per year for the
oldest cohort (age 50-59 in 1979) versus 7.4 percent for the youngest cohort

L&The results are qualitatively unchanged if state of residence is used
instead of region of residence. The estimated coefficients suggest that rates
of return to education vary across regions of residence by as much as 2
percent per year. Returns are lowest in the Mountain and Pacific regions. and
highest in the East-South Central and West-South Central regions. These
patterns are consistent with those reported by Chlsuick (1974) in an earlier
analysis of the regional variation in returns to education.

16

(age 30-39 in 1979). The interstate dispersion in returns shows the opposite
trend, being largest for the oldest cohort and smallest for the youngest.17
The correlations in the lower panel of Table 2 suggest that returns to
education are significantly related to all thre. measures of school quality.
The connection is illustrated in Figure 3, which plots the rate of return for
each state-of-birth (for the 1920-29 cohort) against the relative teacher wage

in the state. We have divided the states into three groups, based on the
pupil-teacher ratio, and plotted states in each group with a different symbol.
The pattern of the plot suggests that returns are higher, controlling for
teacher wages, among states with lower pupil-teacher ratios.

A second illustration of the relation between school quality and returns
is provided by Figure 4, which plots the change in the return to education

between the 1920-29 and the 1940-49 cohort against the chane in the pupilteacher ratio for the same cohorts. Even within states, the figure suggests a
systematic correlation between the return to schooling and the quality of the
public schools.

b. Rates of Return and the quality of Schools
Table 3 presents estimation results for a series of regression models

fitted to the estimated rates of return presented in Table 2. The models are
estimated by weighted least squares, using as weights the inverse sampling

variances of the estimated returns.18 The first group of models, in columns

that our estimated rates of return are measured with sampling error.
optimal second-stage estimation scheme should take account of the
covarjances between the estimated returns for different states. We have
experimented with such a procedure and found few differences from the simpler
weighting scheme described in the text. The reason for this is that the

17

(1) through (5) ,

exclude any state-specific information other than the

measured quality variables, while the second group, in columns (6) through

(10), includes a set of 49 unrestricted state effects. The latter models are
identified by changes in school quality that occurred over time within states.

The model in column (1) includes only dummy variables for the second and
third cohorts. These two variables alone explain 71. percent of the (weighted)

variance in the returns to education.t9 The estimated coefficients show
significantly higher returns for the later cohorts - -

approximately

1.2

percent per decade. The three quality variables are introduced individually
into the r'?gression model in columns (2) through (4), and jointly in column

(5). Individually, all three variables are strongly correlated with returns
to education, with c-statistics of 3.3. 7.0, and 7.2 for the pupil-teacher

ratio, term length, and the relative teacher wage, respectively. Jhen the
three quality variables are entered together, they are jointly significant.

although the effects of term length and the pupil-teacher ratio are smaller
and less precisely estimated, presumably as a result of the high degree of
colinearity between the quality measures.

estimated returns by state-of-birth are "almost" independent. The only source
of covariation between them arises from the fact that the same regression
parameters are used to adjust for other control variables in the first-stage
regression.

test statistics for the hypothesis that the included explanatory variables

dependent variable. For the sample in Table 3, TSS—4014J3. The resulting test
statistic is distributed as chi-squared with degrees of freedom equal to the
number of estimated returns (147) minus the number of estimated parameters.
For example, the chi-squared test Statistic for the model in column (1) is
1164, with 144 degrees of freedom. On the other hand, the chi-squared test
statistic for the model in column (10) is 165.5, with 93 degrees of freedom.

18

The models with state-specific effects lead to broadly similar
conclusions as the models in columns (l)-(5), although the estimated
coefficients of the pupil-teacher ratio are larger in absolute value when
state effects are included, and the estimated effects of the other two quality

measures are attenuated. When the three quality variables are included
jointly (in column (10))

the

estimated coefficient of the term length variable

falls to zero. Evidently, only two dimensions of school quality can be
identified in the data once state-specific effects are included.20
The quality variables have a sizeable impact on the return to education.
For example, based on the estimate in Column 10, a decrease in the pupil-

teacher ratio of 6 students (which is the nationwide change experienced from

1966 to 1986) is associated with a .56 percentage point increase in the return
to education for years of schooling above the threshold level.

If the

threshold level of education is the eighth grade, this reduction in the pupilteacher ratio would lead to about a 4.5 percent increase in the relative
earnings of college graduates.

Despite the significance of the quality variables, they explain
relatively little of the inter-cohort trend in returns to education.

Comparing the models in columns (5) and (1). for example, the quality measures
explain only about 12 percent of the increased return to education between the
earliest and the middle cohorts, and 6 percent of the increase between the

200ne possible difficulty with the term length variable is that teachers
would prefer a shorter term. This suggests that teacher quality may decline
with term length, holding constant teacher wages. We have re-estimated the
models in Table 3 using the teacher wage expressed in terms of days worked per
year (using term length as the measure of days worked) instead of annual
salary. This change has the effect of raising the coefficient on the term
length variable by about 0.5, with little or no effect on the other
coefficients in the model. Even with this adjustment, the term length effects
in column (10) are insignificantly different from zero.

19

middle and latest cohorts. in the models with State effects the school
quality variables explain a larger share of the inter-cohort trend in the
return to education: about 20 percent of the increase in returns between the
1920-29 cohort and the 1930-39 cohort, and about 10 percent of the increase

between the 1930-39 cohort and the 1940-49 cohort. Nevertheless, the cohort
dummies are highly significant, and their omission would lead to a substantial
overstatement of the effects of the quality variables.21
Of course, the higher rate of return for younger cohorts is not
necessarily a consequence of higher quality education.

if there is any

relation between age and the returns to education, the dummies in Table 3

confound age and cohort effects. To provide some evidence on the relative
importance of cohort and age effects, we used the 1970 Census to estimate

rates of return to education in 1970 for two of the same birth cohorts. Based
on a simple log-linear regression model with controls for linear and quadratic
experience and state of residence, we estimated the following rates of return
by cohort and time period:22

If we assume that the 1930-39 cohort had as good (or only slightly

better) quality schooling than the earlier cohort, these data indicate an

21For example, if the cohort dummies are excluded from the model in
column (10) the coefficient of the pupil-teacher ratio is -50.1, with a

To the extent possible, we have used similar sample definitions and

20

overall decline in the average return to education between 1970 and 1980 of
about 0.50 percent (comparing the 6.73 percent return of the 1920-29 cohort in

1970 to the 6.25 percent return of the 1930-39 cohort in 1980). Using this
estimate of the period effects, the implied age effects indicate a 1.2 percent
decline in the return to education between age 40-49 and age 50-59, and a 0.70

percent decline between age 30-39 and 40-49. Thus, most of the increase in
returns to education for later cohorts documented in Table 3 is probably
attributable to aging effects.

Finally, we note that the estimated state effects in Table 3 are also

highly significant. For example, a comparison of the models in columns (1)
and (6) leads to a chi-squared statistic of 963 for the joint significance of

the state effects (with 48 degrees of freedom). A similar comparison of the
models in columns (5) and (10) leads to a test statistic of 642. These
results suggest that some important determinants of the return to education

are missing from our analysis. Examination of the estimated state effects
indicates that returns to education are relatively low (controlling for
measured quality) for men born in the South and in the North-Central/NorthWest regions (Montana, the Dakotas, Oregon, Washington, Idaho), and relatively
high in the Midwest and Northeast.

A finding of relatively low returns for white men in the Southern States
may be. somewhat surprising, given that the quality measures in our analysis

refer to the entire school system in each state. States that operated
segregated school systems before 1954 typically had lower pupil-teacher
ratios, longer term lengths, and higher teacher salaries for white students
than black students (see section IV,

below).

As a result, average quality

measures based on total student enrollment probably understate the quality of

21

the schools for white students in the segregated states. Nevertheless, when a
dummy variable for the segregated states is added to the model in column (5)
of Table 3, it

has

an estimated coefficient of - .41 (with a standard error of

0.13). Furthermore, when the segregated states are stratified into those with
20 percent or higher black enrollment, and those with less than 20 percent
black enrollment, the returns to education are even lower in the states with
higher black enrollments (0.42 percent versus 0.31 percent lower in states

with less than 20 percent black enrollment). These findings are not
consistent with a simple mis-measurement hypothesis for the quality of white

schools in the South. Rather, they suggest that other dimensions of quality,
or characteristics of the state such as the degree of urbanization, affect the
returns to education for individuals from the South.

c, Family Background and Additional Aspects of School Quality
In view of the substantial unexplained differences in

the

returns to

education both within and across states, we have explored the effects of
several other school and state-level characteristics on the returns to

education. Table 4 summarizes our main findings. In each case we have
included our three basic measures of school quality, as well as state-

specific fixed effects. To preview the results, we find that the estimated
coefficients of the school quality variables are largely unaffected by the
addition of controls for other characteristics, including characteristics of
teachers, average income in the State, and characteristics of private schools.

Columns 1-3 of Table 4 address the effect of family background

characteristics on the return to education. A number of previous studies
(including the Coleman Report (1964)) have found a strong association between
family background factors, such as parental education and income, and student

22

performance on standardized tests. If these family background characteristics
are correlated with school quality, and if these characteristics change
substantially over time within states (SO they are not partialled-out by the
state fixed-effects), our estimates of the effect of school quality may be
confounded by the effect of family background variables.

Although the Census lacks direct information on the education of
individuals' parents, we can at least partially control for differences in
parental education by including the median level of education among adults who
lived in the state when the men in our sample attended school (row 4).

Likewise, we include the log of real per capita income in the state at the

time the cohorts in our sample entered school (row 5)23 Regardless of
whether they are included separately or jointly, each of these variables has a
relatively small and statistically insignificant effect on the return to

education. Moreover, the estimated effects of the three main school quality
variables (pupil-teacher ratio, term length, and relative teacher wage) are
unaffected by the inclusion of these family background variables.
Teacher Characteristics

Columns 4-6 explore the role of teacher characteristics on the returns to

schooling. The fraction of male teachers is included because, holding
constant the level of teacher salaries, one might expect the quality of the

teaching staff to vary with the fraction of male teachers. For example,
assuming that female teachers were paid less than otherwise identical males
during the period 1926-1966, one can view the percentage of male teachers as a

proxy for lower quality teachers. Alternatively, one can view the fraction of
male teachers as an indicator of higher non-wage compensation or better

23These variables are described in greater detail in Appendix A.

23

working conditions within the schools, as would be necessary to attract more
men into the teaching profession in a given state, holding constant wages.
Perhaps surprisingly, the results indicate that an increase in the

fraction of teachers in the state who are male has a substantial negative

impact on students' return to education. An increase in the fraction of male
teachers from 19 to 42 percent, which is the range observed across states in
1966, is associated with a 0.77 percentage point lower return to years of
education above the threshold.
Columns 5 and 6 add the mean years of education of teachers in the state

to the regression equation.24 The estimated coefficient of mean teacher
education is positive and statistically significant, whereas the estimated

effect of teachers' experience is negligible. Notice that the pupil-teacher
ratio and relative teacher wage continue to be significant determinants of th
return to education when these teacher quality variables are included; in
fact, their estimated coefficients are hardly affected by the addition of the

teacher quality variab1es.5 Furthermore, the addition of controls for the
average education and experience of teachers hardly changes the estimated

coefficient of the fraction of male teachers. Whether the fraction of male
teachers influence the return to education because male teachers are less

24The Biennial Survey does not Contain information on the training of
teachers. Consequently, as described in Appendix A, we derived these
variables from the 1940, 1950 and 1960 Censuses.
251n results not reported here, we have also included the truancy rate,
defined as one minus the ratio of average daily attendance to average daily
enrollment. This variable had an insignificant effect, perhaps because it is
measured with substantial error as many schools are slow to administratively
eliminate dropouts from the list of enrolled students. In addition, the
correctly measured truancy rate may have two opposing effects that cancel out:
a higher truancy rate reduces the effective pupil-teacher ratio for students
in attendance, but the effective length of the school term is shorter for
those who are absent.

24

effective teachers, or through some other channel, is difficult to ascertain.
Estimates of the high school completion rate and the college completion
rate for each state-of-birth and cohort group are included in the models in

columns (8) and (9). These variables are added to control for biases that may
arise as more schooling is acquired by a higher fraction of a given cohort.

For example, suppose that more schools are built in a state, leading to a
decrease in the pupil/teacher ratio and a decrease in the travel time for

students. Suppose further that individuals differ in their expected returns
to education, and that as more high schools are built, some individuals who
previously dropped out after 8th grade acquire more education.

In this case,

one might expect increases in school quality to be correlated with lower
returns to education, reflecting a negative correlation between the average
rate of return to education and the fraction of individuals with higher

education. In our data there is a strong positive correlation (both in crosssection and within particular states over time) between average educational
attainment and measures of education quality.26

Therefore, if rates of

return vary systematically across the population, and if individuals with

higher expected returns choose more schooling, then there is a possible
downward bias in estimates of the effect of schooling quality on returns to

education. This can be controlled in part by including measures of the
fraction of individuals at higher education levels in each cohort.27

26For example, across our 3 cohorts and 49 states of birth the
correlation between the fraction who completed high school and the pupilteacher ratio is - .71.

27Similar biases are widely acknowledged to make interstate comparisons
of standardized test scores, such as the SAT, very difficult. For example,
data for 1982 on average SAT scores and the fraction of high school graduates
taking the test show a strong negative association across states. See Di2est
of Education Statistics 1987 edition, Table 82, page 95.

25

Perhaps surprisingly, neither the high school graduation rate nor the
college graduation rate has a statistically significant effect on the return

to education. Moreover, the high school graduation rate has a negative
coefficient, while the college graduation rate has a small, positive

coefficient. These results provide little evidence of sorting among students
into higher education on the basis of different expected returns to education.
Private Schools

All of the previous estimates have measured school quality by the

characteristics of the public school system. Not all students attend public
schools, however. During the period 1920-1960, the fraction of students
enrolled in private schools grew from 7.5 percent to 13.6 percent.28 The
variation is even greater in a cross section of states: in 1938, for example,
the share of private enrollments ranged from less than 2 percent in many

Southern states to over 20 percent in New Hampshire and Rhode Island. The
presence of private schools introduces two potential sources of unobserved

variation in school quality. First, private schools may be more or less
effective than public schools.29 Second, private schools may have different
staffing levels, teacher salaries, and term lengths than the public schools.

28

Most prtvate school students attend Catholtc schools. For example, in
.

1938 the fraction of private school students in Catholic schools was 89.5
percent. In 1956 this figure was 90.9.
29Coleman, Hoffer and Kilgore (1982) present data on standardized test
scores that indicate higher achievement levels among students in private
(mainly Catholic) schools. The interpretation of these data is an issue of
some dispute: see Goldberger and Cain (1982), Murnane (1984), and San Segundo
(1987).

26

In an effort to examine these issues, we collected information on private
school enrollments and the pupil-teacher ratio in Catholic schools.3°
Evidence on the effects of accounting for private school enrollment is

presented in columns (9) and (10) of Table 4. In column (9) we include the
fraction of students enrolled in all private schools as an additional

explanatory variable for the rate of return to education. Controlling for
pupil-teacher ratios, term length, and relative teacher salaries in the public
schools, the effect of higher private school enrollments is numerically small

and statistically insignificant. These results suggest that increases in
private school enrollment do not by themselves affect returns to education.
The specification in column (10) is an attempt to directly measure the
biases created by using data for the public schools to proxy pupil-teacher

ratios for the state as a whole. The average pupil-teacher ratio is a
weighted sum of ratios in the public and private systems. Hence, the
measurement error in using the public school ratio as a proxy for the overall
state average is the product of the fraction of enrollment in private schools

and the gap between the private and public school ratios.31 An estimate of
this error component is included in the model in column (10). As predicted by
a naive model of attenuation bias, the addition of this control variable

raises the estimated coefficient of the pupil-teacher ratio. Furthermore, the

30As described in Appendix A, the Biennial Survey contains information
on private schools in some years. Information on the number of private school
teachers, however, is limited to Catholic schools.

the private school system, and let £ represent the fraction of enrollment in
private schools. Then p —

27

estimated coefficient of the error component is (roughly) equal to the
estimated coefficient of the pupil-teacher ratio in the public schools.

Nevertheless, the relatively modest changes in the estimated effect of the
public school quality variables suggest that the biases introduced by
measuring only the quality of public schools are small.
Thus far, we have proceeded by considering extensions to the basic
quality variables (family background, teacher quality, private schools)

individually. In coluxnn 11 we jointly include several of the additional
variables. With the exception of the term length variable, the school qualit',

variables have their expected signs and are statistically significant. In
contrast, the variables measuring family background characteristics, student
educational achievement, and private school attendance generally have

insignificant and small effects. The data seem to accord a greater role to
school quality than to other variables in determining the return to education.

d. Adjustments for Mobility of Pre-school and School-age Children
Interstate mobility of pre-school and school-age children introduces a

problem similar to measurement error in the interpretation of the returns to

education for individuals born in a particular state. To proceed, it is

useful to concentrate on a single cohort. Let . represents the estimated
rate of return to education for individuals born in state j (in a particular
cohort) ,

and let -

represent

the rate of return for individuals educated in

state s.32 Finally, let p. represent the probability that an individual
attended school in state s, given that he was born in State j. Then

320f course, some children are educated in more than one state. We
abstract from this difficulty.

birth with current state-of-residence for white children age 6-12 (both male

and female) in the Public Use Sample of the 1940 Census. The average
probability that a 6-12 year old is living in his or her state of birth is
around 90 percent, although this probability ranges from 62 percent for
children born in the District of Columbia to 94 percent for children born in
North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

In principle, this estimate of the matrix P

is only appropriate for children born between 1928 and 1934, and only for

those with 1-6 years of schooling. Nonetheless, we used this transition
matrix to transform the estimated rates of return for each of the 3 birth
cohorts into estimates of the rate of return for attending school in different

states. We then re-estimated the regression models in Table 3, using the
corrected rates of return as dependent variables. The results are presented
in Table 5•33

The results are qualitatively similar to those in Table 3. The
correction has the effect of expanding the standard deviation of the estimated

variances for the corrected returns. These sampling variances are used to
weight the regressions in Table 5.

29

returns by 10 percent.34 As a consequence, the magnitudes of the estimated
coefficients are typically 5 to 15 percent larger than in the uncorrected
model, although the associated standard errors rise by roughly the same

proportion. On balance, the results suggest that corrections for interstate
mobility have a relatively minor impact on the qualitative and quantitative

conclusions in Table S. This reflects the relatively low mobility rates of
pre-school and school-age children, and the absence of a strong connection
between interstate mobility and the geographic pattern of the measured quality
of education.

IV. Returns to Education by

Cohort

and State of Birth for Black Males

The quality of schooling available to blacks born between 1920 and 1949

varied even more widely across states than that for whites. In the early part
of this century, black students in the segregated Southern states attended
overcrowded schools staffed by poorly qualified teachers.35 By comparison,
most Northern states allowed black students to attend regular schools, often

far superior to those attended by Southern whites.36 During the 1940's,
however, there was a remarkable surge in the absolute and relative quality of

34The correction actually affects the estimated returns for the oldest
cohort more than for the youngest cohort. The ratio of the corrected to the
uncorrected standard deviation of estimated returns is 1.19 for the 1920-29
birth cohort, 1.11 for the 1930-39 birth cohort, and 1.08 for the 1940-49 cohort.
35The U.S. Office of Education published an impressive series of
monographs throughout the early 20th century documenting the poor quality of
black schools: for example, Jones (1917). See also the classic work by Bond
(1934).

36Prior to World War II, some Northern states still operated segregated
schools. For example, in 1938 over one-half of black high school students in
Illinois and Indiana attended segregated schools (see the Btennal Survey of
Education 1936-38 Edition, Chapter IV, Table 5).

30

black schools in the South. These changes have been attributed to the legal
campaign to equalize teacher salaries initiated by the NAACP in 1936, and to
the growing political influence of blacks in the Southern states (see, for

example, Bullock, 1967). In any case, interstate differences in the quality
of black schooling, and in the rate of change of the quality of black schools,

reflected forces far beyond simple differences in family background. It is
therefore useful to use differences in the characteristics of schools for
black students as a check on the inferences we have drawn from the relation
between school quality and feturns to education for whites.

Although we have little direct information on the quality of schools for
blacks educated in the North, the Biennial Survey provides relatively complete

data for those who attended school in the South. Tables 6a and 6b illustrate
the extent of racial inequality in school characteristics for students

educated in the 18 states with segregated schools. These tables present
average quality measures for three cohorts of men, assuming that each person

attended six years of elementary school. The discrepancy between quality
measures for white and black students is readily apparent. For example, in
Mississippi blacks born between 1920 and 1929 attended schools with an average
of 50 students per teacher, while whites attended schools with an average of

32 students per teacher. In most States the length of the school term and the
level of teacher pay were also substantially lower in black schools during the

1920's and 1930's. Nevertheless, in some Southern states (West Virginia,
Kentucky, District of Columbia) the gap in quality between white and black
students was relatively small.

By the time the 1940-49 birth cohort attended school, the gap in the
quality of education between white and black students had diminished, even in

31

the deep South. For example, in South Carolina the average school term for
the 1920-29 cohort of blacks was only 60 percent as long as the corresponding

school term for whites. In the 1953-54 school year (the last year for which
data are available by race in the Biennial Survey) the white and black schools

in South Carolina met for averages of 180 and 179 days, respectively. Similar
equalization of teacher salaries and pupil-teacher ratios is evident for most
states by the early 1950's.37
Following the procedures outlined in Section III, we used data from the
980 Census to estimate rates of return to education for blacks born in the 49
mainland states in each of three 10 year birth cohorts (1920-29, 1930-39,
1940-49) .

As for white men, these returns were estimated in three cohort-

specific regressions, including state-of-birth dummy variables, state-ofresidence dummy variables, controls for experience, marital status, and
residence in an SMSA, and interactions of education with current region of

residence. The returns to education were estimated by interacting education
and state-of-birth indicators, where education is defined as the maximum of
zero and the difference between completed education and the grade of the
second percentile of the education distribution of black workers in the
individual's state-of-birth and cohort.
because of the relatively small numbers of blacks born in many states,

the rates of return are less precisely estimated than those for whites. In
fact, the 1980 Census sample contains no black men born between 1920 and 1929

in Mew Hampshire, and none born between 1930 and 1939 in Vermont. Table 7

37The one important exception to this pattern of equalization seems to
have been Mississippi. In 1953-54, the ratio of black-to-white average teacher
salaries was 0.57. By 1959-60 this ratio had risen to 0.83 and by 1965-66 to
0.92. See Griffith (1969).

32

reports weighted means, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation of

the estimated rates of returns to education by race and cohort.38 These data
confirm

earlier

findings (e.g., Jelch (1973a, 1973b)) that the rate of return

to education is lower for blacks than whites among individuals born before

1940. Sy comparison, imong individuals born after 1940 the rate of return to
education is slightly higher for blacks than for whites. The interstate

dispersion in the rate of return to education --

whether measured by the

- is

standard deviation or the coefficient of variation -

greater for blacks

than for whites for the two earlier cohorts, but again this pattern is

reversed for the cohort of men born after 1940. The dramatic reduction in the
interstate dispersion in the return to education for blacks coincides with the

relative improvement in the average quality of education for blacks in the
Southern states, and with the corresponding reduction in the interstate
dispersion in school quality for black students.

The estimated rates of return to education for black men form the

dependent variables for the regression models reported in Table 8. For men
born in the segregated states, the explanatory variables are the measures of

school quality reported in Table 6a.39 For men born in other states, we use
the average quality variables for the state school system as a whole, assuming

that each individual attended 6 years of public school. These measures

38The standard deviations and coefficients of variation in Table 7 are
adjusted for the expected contributions of sampling variation in the estimated
rates of return.

39The relative wage for black teachers was constructed in the same manner
as the relative wage for white teachers. The small number of Southern states
which did not report school quality data by race for years prior to 1954 were
dropped from the sample used in these regressions because the data for the
system as a whole (i.e., white and black schools combined) are a grossly
inaccurate measure of school quality for blacks in these states.

33

presumably overstate the quality of schools actually attended by black
students in the non-segregated states, although available data on pupil-

teacher ratios in segregated high schools in Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana show

little difference between school quality in black and white schools.4° The
models in Table 8 are estimated by weighted least squares, using the inverse
sampling variances of the estimated returns as weights.41
The first column of Table 8 reports estimates of a model that includes

only cohort dummy variables. The estimated cohort effects reflect the sharp
increases in rates of return to education noted in Table 7. The school
quality variables are introduced individually in the models in columns (2),

(3) and (4), and jointly in the model in column (5). Similar specifications

with 44 unrestricted state-effects are reported in columns (6)-(lO). The
models with individual quality measures are quite similar to those estimated
for whites in Table 3. In each case, returns to education are significantly

related to school quality. In row 7 of the table we report the probability
value of an F-statistic t.jat tests for equality of the estimated coefficients

between the model for blacks and the corresponding model for whites.

42

These

statistics are generally favorable to the hypothesis of the same model for

40See Biennial Survey of Education 1936-38 Edition. Chapter IV, Table 5.

41As a rough check on the effect of assigning overall school system
characteristics to black students, we re-estimated the models in Table 8 on
the subset of segregated Southern states. Estimates from models without
individual state effects are very similar to those in columns (l)-(5) of Table
8. When individual state effects are included the models in columns (8)-(lO)
are again very similar. The one major discrepancy is for the model that
includes only the pupil-teacher ratio. On the subset of segregated states,
with state effects, the estimated effect of the pupil-teacher ratio is small
and imprecise.
42The models for whites are those reported in Table 3. In testing for
equality between the models for whites and blacks we allow for race-specific
intercepts, and race-specific cohort effects.

34

whites and blacks, although the estimated

coefficients of the relative teacher

wage are uniformly smaller for blacks.
In the two models that include all 3 quality measures (columns (5) and
(10)) the individual contributions of the quality variables are poorly

determined. This is particularly true of the model chat includes statespecific effects. Given the rather imprecise measures of the return to
education for blacks from many states, and the high degree of colinearity

between the quality measures, it is understandable that the regression model
has difficulty identifying the precise effects of the individual quality

variables. On balance, we believe that the results for blacks provide strong
support for a causal interpretation of the quality coefficients. The
similarity of the estimated equations for the two groups is consistent with

the view that endogenous school quality and/or omitted

variables are not a

major source of bias in the estimated quality effects.43
An examination of the estimated cohort effects in the various columns of

Table 8 indicates that, especially in the models that exclude state fixed
effects, the quality variables explain much of the inter-cohort convergence of

returns to education for blacks and whites. In particular, trends in the
pupil-teacher ratio are able to account for most of the relative growth in
returns to education for blacks between the first (1920-29) and second (1930-

39) cohort, and about one-half of the relative increase between the second and
430ne potentially important difference between whites and blacks is the
out-migration rate of children from their state-of-birth. Following the
approach in Section hId, we tabulated the probability that a child age 6-15
was living in his or her state-of-birth at the time of the 1940 Census. This
probability is slightly higher for blacks than whites (91.5 versus 89.3
percent). Interestingly, the probabilities by age show a sharp increase for
blacks after age 13, and are higher for blacks than whites by age 16. These
patterns suggest that blacks were more likely than whites to leave their state
of birth after comoletinz schoolinz.

in relative returns is an

important question for further research.

V. Oe-Ste Estimates of the Effects of School quality on Earninzs
The estimated effects of school quality presented in the previous two
sections are based on a relatively simple specification of the earnings-

schooling relationship. To explore the robustness of our findings to
alternative specifications it is convenient to work directly with the micro-

data in a one-step estimation procedure. A one-step
additional advantage of incorporating intra-cohort

procedure has the

variation in school quality

resulting from differences in the timing and duration of school attendance.
In this section we present a series of models that relate individual earnings
to individual-specific measures of school quality.

We compare the results of

alternative functional forms for the return-to schooling relationship,
including models without a minimum threshold level of education, and models
that permit differential effects of school quality on the returns to precollege and post-secondary education.

Unfortunately, one-step estimation of the model in equations (1) and (2)
poses a major computational burden.

A one-step model equivalent to the fixed-

effects estimates presented in Tables 3 and 4 includes over 350 variables! To
simplify the model, we estimate:

and an indicator for residence in

is an individual-spCifiC vector of schooling quality measures,

formed from simple averages of state-specific data during the years in which
individual i attended school, and AGEjiC is the age of individual i.
This model differs from the one described by equationS (1) and (2) in a

number of important respects. First, the state-of-residence and state-ofbirth effects are constrained to be the same across all three cohorts.

Similarly, the coefficients of the x vector are constrained to be the same for
all three cohorts, as are the controls for differences in the rate of return
to schooling by region of current residence (the

Second, there are no

state-of-birth interactions with years of education in (3). Consequently,
one-step estimates based dn (3) correspond to two-step estimates that exclude

state-specific fixed effects in the second state. Finally, equation (3) uses
individual-specific measures of the school quality variables, and incorporates
age-specific interactions with the return to education.
The specification of equation (3) retains the assumption that measures of
school quality affect earnings only insofar as they raise or lower the returns

to education. Thus, levels of the school quality variables are explicitly

excluded from the earnings equation. In equation (1) this is a costless
restriction, since the levels of the school quality variables are absorbed by

the cohort-specific state-of-birth effects. In a model such as (3) that
restricts the state-of-birth effects across cohorts, and includes individualspecific education quality measures, the effects of the levels of the school
quality variables are potentially identifiable.

37

Even the estimation of this simplified specification is a formidable task
on our 1980 Census sample, which Contains some 1.2 million observations. To
ease the computational burden we drew a stratified random sample of white men
from the 5 Percent A-Sample of the 1980 Census.

The sample was drawn to

contain at most 2000 observations from any particular state-of-birth and

cohort. We then estimated the micro-level models by weighted least squares,
using as weights the inverse sampling probabilities for each observation. The
results are presented in Tables 9 and
Columns (l)-(4) of Table 9 introduce the three quality measures
individually, and then jointly, into the earnings equation as interactions

with the level of education. Following our two-stage estimation approach,
individual education is measured as years of schooling above the grade
attained by the second per'centile of the educational

distribution in the

individual's state of birth and cohort. (The coefficients have been scaled to

be comparable to the two-step estimates.) The estimated coefficients of the
education-quality interactions ire very similar to those reported in columns
(2)-(5) of Table 3, although the

standard

errors are 40-50 percent smaller

Apparently, the restrictions on the state-of-birth and state-of-residence
effects in the one-step model have little impact on the signs or magnitudes of
the estimated quality effects.
The

models in columns (5) and (6) present even more restrictive

specifications of the state-of-birth and state-of-residence effects. The
specification in column (5) drops the

state-of-birth effects, while the

specification in column (6) drops both

state-of-residence and state-of-birth

and obtained similar results.

38

effects. These restrictions increase the magnitudes of the estimated quality
effects -

- particularly

the pupil-teacher ratio. Evidently, the interactions

of school quality and individual education are correlated with permanent
state-level characteristics that are associated with higher returns to
schooling.

Our specifications so far have assumed that improvements in the quality
of the public school system raise the returns to each additional year of

schooling by the same amount. It may seem plausible that increases in the
quality of the public schools have a bigger effect on the returns to
elementary and secondary education than on the returns to college.

One could

easily argue, however, that improvements in the quality of elementary and
secondary schooling (such as improved mathematics instruction) actually
benefit students who attend college more than those who only attend high
school.

In an effort to address this issue, the specifications in columns (7) and
(8) allow for differential effects of school quality on the returns to post-

secondary education. Column (7) includes three additional interaction terms
between the measures of school quality and years of post-secondary education.

The estimates suggest that higher pupil-teacher ratios do indeed affect the
returns to elementary and secondary education more than the returns to post-

secondary education. In fact, the net effect of higher pupil-teacher ratios
on the returns to post-secondary education is positive. By comparison,
changes in teacher wages and changes in term length have statistically similar
effects on pre-college and post-secondary returns.
The model in column (8) adds years of post-secondary schooling and its
interaction with the three age/cohort variables to the model in column (7)

39

Only the effects of the teacher wage variable are similar to those in the

restricted model. The effects of the pupil-teacher variable are negligible,
whereas increases in term length are estimated to have a negative effect on
the returns to pre-college education, and a large positive effect on post-

secondary returns. It is important to keep in mind that the model in column
(8) includes a total of 20 education interaction terms, including the 12
displayed in the table and 9 interactions with current region.

Evidently, the

regression has some difficulty apportioning the variation in rates of return
to education, once the returns to pre-college and post-secondary education are
completely unrestricted.

The models in Table 10 address a second set of issues: What is the
effect of adding the levels of the quality measures to the earnings

regressions? And what is the effect of ignoring the threshold level of
education?

As in Table 9, the first two columns of Table 10 present models

that define education as years of schooling above the threshold level attained

by the second percentile of the education distribution in an individual's

cohort and state-of-birth. By comparison, the third and fourth columns
present models that simply use years of completed education. Column (I) is

reproduced from column (4) of Table 9, and is presented for ease of

comparison. The specification in column (2) adds the levels of the three

quality variables to the earnings model. This addition increases the
magnitudes of the estimated interaction effects of the pupil-teacher and term
length variables, while having only a small effect on the interaction of

teacher wages and education. The levels of the pupil-teacher and term length
variables are themselves highly significant. In each case,

the pattern of the

level and interaction coefficients implies that an improvement in quality

40

rotates the earningsscho0ling relationship.

In the case of the pupil-teacher

ratio, the point of rotation is at 14 years of education above the threshold

level (which averages 7 years of schooling), while in the case of the term

length

variable the rotation point is at 7 years above the threshold.

Columns (3) and (4) present specifications that ignore any threshold in

the earnings-schooling relationship. A comparison of the models with and
without the levels of the quality variables shows the importance of including
the levels of the quality variables if the education threshold is ignored.
Whereas the results in column (4) are similar to those in column (2), the
results in column (3) give very little evidence of school quality effects.
This is apparently a result of the fact that improvements in school quality

tate the earnings-schooling relation through a point other than the zeroschooling intercept. Although the rotation point is somewhat above the
threshold level of schooling, the specification in (I) is nevertheless close

enough to the correct specification to obtain significant quality effects.

VI.

Conclusion
The estimates presented in this paper provide new evidence that the

quality of schooling affects earnings. Men who are educated in states with
higher quality school systems tend to earn a higher economic return for their

years of schooling. Although the evidence we have assembled is necessarily
non-experimental, we believe that our findings are consistent with causal

interpretation of the role of school quality. In the first place, our
findings are based on statistical models that control for any differences
across state-of-birth and cohort groups in the overall level of earnings.

Secondly, we have controlled for differences in the rates of return to

41

education earned by current residents in different regions of the country.
Third, we have controlled for any permanent
return to education earned by different

differences across states in the

cohorts of men, and for differences in

family background measures (education and earnings of the parents' generation)
that may affect subsequent labor market performance.

Finally, our analysis

suggests that the relation between school quality and the returns to education

is similar for whites and blacks. Since we believe that changes in the
quality of black schooling were largely exogenous

to individual student

choices and backgrounds, the similarity of the estimated effects of school
quality for the two race groups is reassuring.

Our findings underscore the paradox we noted in the introduction: school
quality appears to have an important

effect on earnings, but is often found to

have little measurable impact on standardized

achievement tests.65 Although

much further research will be needed to resolve this paradox, we believe that
success in the labor market is at least as important a yardstick for measuring
the performance of the education system as success

on standardized tests. At

a minimum, our finding of a positive link between school quality and the

economic returns to education should give pause to those who argue that
investments in the public school system have

few benefits for students.

Appendix A
Sources for Data on School Quality: 1920-66
I.

Basic Data for All Students

The following series were extracted from various issues of the Bienniel.
Survey Of Education and the Digest of Education Statistics:
a. number of pupils enrolled in full time public elementary and
secondary school.
b. average number of days in the school term (full-time public
elementary and secondary schools)
c. average number of days attended by each enrolled student (full
time public elementary and secondary schools) (1920-58 only).
d. number of instructional staff, including supervisors and
principles (full time public elementary and secondary schools).
e. percent of teachers who are male (full time public elementary
and secondary schools).
f. average annual salary per member of the instructional
staff (full time public elementary and secondary schools).
These data were collected by state for alternating years, beginning with
1919-1920. In some cases, the figures in the most recently published
Bienniel Survey were revised in subsequent editions. We have attempted to
incorporate as many of these revisions as possible. For 1960 and later we
collected a variable representing the percentage of school days attended by
enrolled students. This percentage was then used to construct an estimate
of average days attended from the series on the length of the school term.
The data from the bienniel editions of the Survey are allocated to the
previous two years: for example, data from the 1937-38 edition is used for
both 1937 and 1938.
II. Data for White and Black School Systems -- 18 Segregated States

With the exception of the percentage of male teachers, the above data
are available for most States for the white and black school systems
separately up to 1954. Data on teacher salaries are unavailable for 193334, and are missing for some states in other years. We used the average of
salaries in 1931-32 and 1935-36 to estimate 1933-34 salaries. In some
In
cases we had information ott teacher salaries in the black schools only.
these cases we used information on the numbers of teachers in the white and
black schools, together with information on average salaries for both
races, to infer the average salary for teachers in the white schools. Data
by race for the schools in Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and West Virginia
are missing in many issues of the Bienrtiel Survey. We used information in
the annual reports of the state offices of education of these four states
to estimate enrollments, numbers of teachers, and average wages in some
years. Data for other years are estimated by linear interpolation between
the available years. In cases where data were unavailable in two
consecutive Bjertnjel Surveys, the observations were dropped from the data
set.

45

iii. Construction of the Relative Teacher Wage
Two wage series were combined to create a relative wage index for
teachers in each State. For 1920-38, we used the wage paid to laborers on
federal road construction projects. This wage is available on a regional
basis (for 9 Census regions) in the Statistical Abstract of the United
States. Data for 1920-29 are taken from the 1930 edition, Table 358. Data
for 1930-56 are taken from the 1957 edition, Table 271. For 1940-66 we use
the average state-level wage of workers covered by the Social Security
system, from U.S. Department of Labor Employment and Training
Administration Handbook number 394. To convert the regional construction
wage rates into state-level averages, we formed the average ratio of the
state Social Security wage to the regional construction wage in the period
1940-44. This average ratio was then applied to the construction wage in
the period 1920-38 to obtain a state-specific average.

IV. Data on Education and Experience of Teachers

a. 1940
We used the public use sample of the 1940 Census to form extracts of
teachers in each of the 48 (mainland) states and District of Columbia.
Teachers were identified by industry (educational services) and occupation
(teachers not elsewhere classified). We sampled only those teachers who
reported either white or black race, and who reported positive earnings and
weeks worked and non-allocated age, sex, race, industry, occupation, and
years of education. The extract contains 9161 teachers.
b. 1950
We used the public use sample of the 1950 Census to form extracts of
teachers in each of the 48 (mainland) states and District of Columbia.
(Owing to technical difficulties our public use sample excludes 1/9 of the
available sample). Teachers were identified by industry (educational
services) and occupation (teachers not elsewhere classified). We sampled
only those teachers who reported either white or black race, and who
reported non-allocated age, sex, race, industry, occupation. and years of
education. The extract contains 3206 teachers.
c. 1960
We used the public use sample of the 1960 Census to form extracts of
teachers in each of the 48 (mainland) States and District of Columbia.
Teachers were identified by industry (educational services) and occupation
(teachers, elementary schools and teachers, secondary schools). We sampled
only those teachers who reported either white or black race, and who
reported non-allocated age. The extract contains 16052 teachers.

cohort of men born in the 1920s, the state-level per capita income in 1940
was assigned to the cohort of men born in the l930s, and the state-level per
capita income in 1950 was assigned to the cohort of men born in the 1940s.
These years roughly correspond to the years when educational expenditures for
each cohort would have been determined.

b. Median Education of Parents' Generation
As a measure of the education of each cohort's parents, we collected
information on the median education of white persons age 25 or older by state
in 1940, 1950, and 1960. These data are reported in Statistical Abstract of
the United States (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, no. 66, 75,
and 85), and were originally derived from the 1940, 1950 and 1960 Censuses.
In 1940, the education data are only reported for native-born individuals,
while in 1950 and 1960 the data pertain to native and foreign born
individuals. The median education of adults in 1940 was assigned to the
l920s cohort, the median education of adults in 1950 was assigned to the
1930s cohort, and the median education of adults in 1960 was assigned to the
l940s cohort.

VI. Private Schools
State-level data on the number of students enrolled in private schools,
the number of students enrolled in Catholic schools, and the number of
teachers in Catholic schools were collected from the Biennial Survey.
Unfortunately, these variables are only available on an irregular basis.
Data for 1937-1938 were assigned to the cohort born in the 1920s, data for
1949-1950 were assigned to the cohort born in the 1930s, and data for 19551956 were assigned to the cohort born in the l940s.

Appendix B
1980 Microdata Samples
Our samples are taken from the Public Use A-sample of the 1980 Census (a
The samples consist of men born in the
5 percent sample of the population) .
48 mainland states or the District of Columbia between 1920 and 1949, and
currently Living in any of the 50 states or D.C. Year of birth is estimated
from information on age and quarter of birth. We include only those
individuals whose race is identified as "white" or "black". Individuals with
imputed information onage, race, sex, education, weeks worked, or total
annual earnings are excluded, as are individuals who report no weeks of work
in 1979. In addition, individuals with wage or salary income in 1979 less
than $101. and individuals with average weekly wage and salary income of less
than $36 or greater than $2,500 are excluded. The final sample sizes are:
Born 1920-29:
Born 1930-39:
Born 1940-49:

whites - 279,008
whites - 299.063
whites - 441,675

blacks - 20,258
blacks - 26,108
blacks - 38,659

These samples are used to form the first-stage estimates of the return to
education in our 2-step procedure. For the one-step estimates presented in
Tables 9 and 10, we used stratified random samples of these overall samples,
drawn to yield a maximum of (approximately) 2,000 white men per cohort and
state-of-birth. The sampling procedure generates a subsample of 265,618.
The regression models are then estimated by weighted least squares, using as
weights the inverse sampling probabilities of the various states-of-birth.
