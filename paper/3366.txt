THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR MASTER FILE:

1959-1987

ABSTRACT

This

document describes the panel of publicly traded United
manufacturing firms which was created and updated at the
National Bureau of Economic Research from 1978 through 1990
within
the Productivity Program. The panel consists of 2726 large
manufacturing firms with one to twenty-nine years of data each; the
period covered by the sampling frame was 1976 through 1987, with
data back to 1959 where possible. There are about 90 variables for
each firm-year of data: the variables give the complete income
statement, balance sheet, statement of changes, and data on the
market value f the common stock.

States

The firms on the file are identified both by their CUSIP
number and by name, making it feasible to match this data to other
sources. A special feature of this data file is that all exits
from the file between 1976 and 1987 have been identified and the
reasons for exit have been tabulated in a diskette file. This file
is described in Appendix A of this document.

Introduction
The Manufacturing Sector Master File is based on the Compustat Annual

Industrial and Over-the-Counter Files for 1978 through 1987. Ic consists of
90 variables per year for each of approximately 2700 firms in the
manufacturing sector (SIC codes 2000 through 3999) for as many years as data

are available. The firms in question must have been on the files and in
existence some time between 1976 and 1987; there are up to 30 years of data

per firm. This document describes how the sample was constructed and
defines the variables which are available for each firm-year observation
(49,225 observations in all).

2. aset DescrjDtjon
The final dataset is on one file: RNDPANSISASDEc89 or
RNDPAN87.MASTER DEC89

Table 2.1 shows the number of firms and the

distribution of these firms across beginning and ending years for the

I am grateful to Kevin Hassett, Steven Kaplan, and Martha Schary for
generously supplying me with their acquisition lists for cross checking
mine, and to Matthew C. Nagler and Hortencja Nevarrez, who spent long hours
in the library looking up much of this information. Some of the data
construction work descibed here was based on earlier work described in
Hall, Cummins, Laderman, and Mundy (1988). The computer work for the
current project was supported by the National Bureau of Economic Research
and the National Science Foundation (grant no. SES-8908521) and the
research effort by the Committee on Research, University of California at
Berkeley.

dataset. The fixed format ASCII (or EBCDIC) version of this file has the
following characteristics:
DSNAME—RNDPAN87 .MASTER. DEC89

VOL—SER—volune ID
DCB—(RECFM—FB , LRECL'-13l6 BLKSIZE—26320)
,

The format is integer, floating point, and four character string variables.
In Fortran, this would be
(2A4, 2A4, 7A4, 7A4, 715, 93F13.5)
and in SAS,

($8. $8. $28. $28. 7*5.0 93*13.5)
There also exists a SAS dataset on tape called RNDFAN87 (dataset name
RNDPAN87.SAs.DEc89) containing these variables, which is preferred if you

plan to use SAS to read the data. The missing value code on both the fixed
format version of the file and on the SAS dataset is the usual SAS code
(period or dot).

In Table 2.2(a) I show an alphabetical list of the variables on the

file with a short description of each one. The table also shows the
Compustat item number if the variable came directly from that file, the

type of the variable, and its byte location on the Fortran file. Character
variables are indicated by 'CHAR.' Tables 2.2(b) and 2.2(c) show the same
list sorted by the byte location on the tape and by the location of the

variables on the original Compustat tape. Many of the variables come
directly from the Compustat files and further information can be obtained

by reference to that Codebook. Those which are computed for this dataset
are described somewhat more fully in the section following the tables. All
dollar values are in millions of current U.S. dollars.

Variable Construction

This section of the documentation describes the construction of each
variable on the tape in somewhat more detail than the lists in Table 2.2.
Users who wish to know more about the variables drawn directly from the
Compustat files should consult that documentation for further information.
ADJ

-- Value

of net short-term assets, equal to current assets (CURRASST),
less the value of inventories (BKINV), less current liabilities
(STL1AB) plus the value of short-term debt (STDEBT). Short-term
debt is added back in because it is treated elsewhere, and
because it is assumed that interest is being paid on it, which is
not the case for the other short-term liablities.
The short-term liabilities of a firm are composed of accounts
payable, income taxes payable, accrued expenses and costs on
contracts, dividends declared, employee benefits, cutomer
This
deposits, and the current portion of long-term debt.
variable does not include unfunded pension liabilities.
The short-term assets of a firm are cash and short-term
investments, accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid taxes,
estimated future tax benefits, security deposits, supplies
and tools not in inventory, and prepaid expenses.

ADJDEP --

This year's depreciation adjusted for the effects of
inflation. This variable is DEPREC deflated by the ratio of
the CP deflator for fixed nonresidential investment AA (see
NPLANT for a definition of AA, average age) years ago to the
current GNP deflator.

ADJFACT -- Compustat data item 27, the cumulative adjustment factor for
common stock splits, stock dividends, etc. This factor, applied
to the per-share data, converts such data into terms of the
share units prevailing in the last year of data. Price data
should be divided by ADJFACT to convert to current units, while
shares data should be multiplied by ADJFACT.

the value of the firms' inventories adjusted for the effects of
inflation. The inventories are valued at cost (book) each year
unless the firm has specified LIFO as one of its methods of
inventory valuation. The use of LIFO implies that the reported
inventory valuation will be too low and an attempt is made to

the Compustat tape. There is potentially some additional information here
on the long-term debt issued 19 years ago.

adjust for this, using the change in inventories from year to
year to obtain a measure of how old the inventories are and
inflating them accordingly.
The process is started by setting ADJINV equal to the book value
in the first year. Then the value of the inventories for each
succeeding year is calculated as follows: if there is an
increase in book inventory from last year to this, last year's
adjusted inventories (AD.JINV) are inflated by the ratio of the
inventory price index this year to the price index last year and
then the increase (assumed to be in current dollars) is added.
If there was a decrease, last year's ADJINV is inflated in the
same way and then written down by the ratio of this year's book
inventories to last year's. The firm uses more than one method of
inventory valuation, the book values are combined with the
adjusted values using proportional weights derived from the
reported ranking of the methods. Each firm uses up to three
inventory methods and they are ranked in order of importance on
the tape.
I use the following rule of thumb to determine the
weights:

Investments in unconsolidated subisdiaries and intangibles
plus other investments (TOTAL) adjusted for inflation. In
order to adjust the reported values of these items for
inflation, we take the same approach as we did for
inventories. In the first year, the value of ADJTOT is
simply set equal to its book value. In each succeeding year,
the previous year's ADJTOT is inflated by the ratio of the
deflators for fixed residential investment in the two years
and then the change in the book value of the investments is
added. If there was a decrease in book, last year's inflated
ADJTOT is multiplied by the ratio of this year's book value
to last year's. As in the case of inventories, this
approximation becomes more and more accurate as time goes by,
but possibly at a slower rate, owing to the older age of the
assets making up the TOTAL variable on average.

INVMETH -- Compustat data item #59, inventory valuation method.

LCOMP - -

Compustat data item #42, labor and related expense including
salaries, wages, profit sharing, payroll taxes, and employee
benefits. (See DLCOMP also.)

LTDEBT - -

The value of long-term debt adjusted for its age structure.
Long-term debt is assumed to have been financed by 20-year
bonds. Given a matrix of bond prices in year t for a bond due
in year s and the distribution of the firm's long-term debt by
the year incurred, it is possible to adjust the face value of
the debt by the bond rates in any given year. We obtain such a
matrix of prices from the Moody's corporate BAA bond price

17

series given previously. The difficulty is to determine the age
structure of each firms debt. In the absence of any history of
the firm prior to 1958, the approach taken is to assume that all
firms have an age structure of debt which is the same as the
aggregate age structure from the 1958 Survey of Current
Business. This distribution is shown in Table 2.4.

After 1958, we attempt to build up each firm's own long-term
debt distribution in the following manner: starting with the
1958 distribution, in each successive year the amount of new
long-term debt issued equals the change in long-term debt From
the previous year to this plus the amount retired this year,
which is assumed to be equal to that issued 20 years ago. There
are two sources of error in this computation:

a) The firm's age structure of debt may not be the same as the
aggregate in 1958.
b) The bonds may not always be for a twenty-year term.
Because of these sources of error, in any year the gross new
debt issued may be negative. If this is the case, we set this
contribution to zero and rescale the entire tw.nty year of
long-term debt accordingly. Given the age distribution of book
value of long-term debt for each of the twenty-three years in
the and the matrix of bond prices we can now compute the market
value of debt as

IININT -- Compustat data item #38, minority interest (balance sheet).

ETCAP - -

the

inflation adjusted net capital stock. This variable is

computed as

NETCAP

—

NPLANT

+ ADJINV + ADJTOT

'0LCFU -- Compustat data item #52, net operating loss carry forward.
'OSHARES -- Compustat data item #25, the number of common shares

outstanding. This variable should be multiplied by the
adjustment factor AD.JFACT to make it comparable across the
years.

PLANT - -

the

net value of the plant adjusted for inflation. This
quantity is obtained by multiplying the book plant value by
the ratio of the GNP deflator for fixed nonresidential
investment in the current year to GNP deflator AA years ago.

18

AA is the average age of the plant and equipment for this
firm which is deduced in the following manner: an average
age series is obtained as the ratio of accumulated
depreciation (gross plant minus net plant) to depreciation
this year. This assumes straight-line depreciation.
Then a length of life of the current plant and equipment is
also computed as the gross plant divided by this year's
depreciation and a five-year moving average is taken of this
series to smooth it. This year's average age is then
adjusted by the ratio of this year's length of life to the
moving average. This has the effect of smoothing the age
series slightly. If the average age exceeds nineteen years,
it is set to nineteen years, since the deflator is only
available back to 1939.
NRATE - -

the

net rate of return to capital, defined as the ratio
of net cash flows less the inflation adjusted value of
depreciation (ADJDEP) divided by the net capital stock
(NETCAP).

OPINC -

- Compustat data item l3, operating income before depreciation.

PCLOSE -- Compustat data item 24, end of calendar year stock price. This
should be divided by ADJFACT to make it comparable to data in
other years.

PENSION -- Compustat data item p43, pension and retirement expense.
PENSPAST -- Compustat data item 9O, unfunded pension costs, past or prior
service.
PENSVEST -

- Compustat data item #89, unfunded pension costs, vested
benefits.

high during year. This
variable should be divided by ADJFACT to make it comparable to
data in other years.

PHIGH -- Compustat data item #22, price of common -

LQ

- - Compustat data item #23, price of common - low during year. This
variable should be divided by ADJFACT to make it comparable to
data in other years.

PREFD •- Compustat data item #19, dividends on preferred stock.

PREFST -- Compustat data item #10, preferred stock (liquidating value).

PREFSTR •- Compustat data item #56, preferred stock (redemption value).
RDINIT - -

R&D stock in initial year, calculated as described in the
appendix.

RECEIV -- Compustat data item #2, receivables.
RENTAL -- Compustat data item #47, rental expense. All costs

19

charged to operations for the rental of space and/or
equipment.
RETEARN -- Compustat data item #36, retained earnings.
RND -- Cornpustat data item #46, expenditures on research and development.
The private (company-funded) expenditures on the development of
new products and services including software but excluding
customer of government-sponsored expenditures, exploration,

engineering expense, inventor royalties, and market research and
testing. Because continuous history of this variable is needed
for the construction of RSTOCK. when it was randomly missing for
one year in the middle of a continuous sequence of reported R&D,
I interpolated a value using the model described in Appendix B.
This model assumes that the logarithm of R&D expenditures evolves
as a random walk, which is justified by the patterns of R&D
spending actually observed. The interpolation affected less than
ten percent of the firms.
Before use, this variable is generally deflated by the deflator
shown in Table 2.3, which is a weighted average of an index of
hourly labor compensation and the implicit price deflator in the
non-financial corporate sector. The weights are 0.49 and 0.51
respectively, and the methodology is patterned on Jaffe (1972).
The underlying data is from U.S. Department of Labor,
Productivity Costs in Nonfinancial Corporations, various issues.

- This

quantity is the one-period (year) rate of return to
holding a share of the company's common stock over the
calendar year. The definition of the one-period rate of
return at time t is the following:

—

where Pt is the price of the common stock at the end of the year
and d are the dividends received per share during the year. Note
that for this definition it is important to be careful that
measures the same share of the company as Pt.

4. Sample Construction
The construction of the sample proceeded in the following way (the
peculiarities of datafile year selection are due to availability of the
tapes): the sample was defined to be all firms in the R&D Master File
constructed at the NBER in 1979-1982 and 1986-1987 (Hall et al. 1988), plus
all manufacturing firms on the Compustat Annual Industrial and OTC files for
1986 and 1987, augmented by a few non-manufacturing firms which were
formerly manufacturing firms or which acquired manufacturing firms during
the period.

First, a list of firms to be selected was constructed by starting with
the 1985 panel and adding all manufacturing firms which were on the
Compustat Headers for the 1986, 1987 Industrial files, and the 1987 OTC file

(the 1986 OTC file was unavailable). For all firms the latest appearance of
the firm in the file was recorded; this produced a list of 2863 unique firms
called PAN87HDA.JUN89, together with the name of the file from which their

data was to be selected (IND, OTC, RES for the pre-1981 files, ID81-IND87,

OTC81-0TC87, and RES84 for the post-1981 files). This list of headers was
combined with the headers for the firms on the 1986 and 1987 Research Files
to ensure that we had selected all manufacturing firms (only a small number
of additional firms were taken from the Research files); the new list

contained 2953 firms. All firms on this list (approximately 1200) which did
not appear in one of the two current 1987 files were printed out.
This list of about 1200 firms was called (ultimately) EXITALL.JUL89,
and it was used to investigate the reason for every exit from the panel

between 1976 and 1987. The results of this investigation are documented in

26

a separate Section (AppendiX A). For the purposes of this project. :e
important fact is that it included approximately 150 firms which changed
their name or reorganized, causing a change to the CUSIP number of the firm

and thus a spurious exit. These cases needed eventually to have their data
spliced between observations under the new and old CUSIPs. To prepare for
this, the list of new CUSIPs was run against the current panel master header

(PA87HDA.JUN89), and a few firms were found which had been overlooked for
some reason (usually a change of industry). The library work involved in
identifying all the exits also identified a few problems (duplicates, etc.)

in PAN87HDA, and the ultimate cleaned list of firms to be selected contained
2897 firms.

The next t..sk was to obtain the actual data; the goal was to maximize

both the number of years of data available for each firm and to maximize

the number of non-missing values for each variable. To do this, at least
two tapes (of different vintages) were used as sources for many of the
firms. A series of jobs (SELIND.., SELOTC. .

, and

SELRES. .)

were run to

select those observations which were to come from the Annual Industrial
1981, 1983-1987, OTC 1981, 1983-1985, 1987, and Research Industrial 1984,

1987 files. The number of observations thus selected is shown in Table
4.1.

The output tapes from these jobs (ANNIND81-87, OTCINC81-87, and
RESIND84-87) were merged and reformatted by MKCS8187 to a single file
(CS8187.REFORNAT) which was organized one firm-year per record,

approximately 40,000 observations in all. This was done so that the data
could be updated more easily in the next step. In addition, to save space,
all firm-year observations with no data were deleted and the last 100 of the

175 variables available for each firm-year were also deleted. A few of

27

these variables (locations 71, 7, 89, 90, 107-116, 127, 128, 129) were
moved to lower-valued locations (51, 54, 57, 58, 6170, 40, 55, 71), since
they would be needed later. Also, the fiscal year month (FYR) was placed
in location 50 and footnotes 1 (mergers), 3 (R&D), 22 (labor compensation),

and 25 (seasonal and parttime employees) were recoded for dummies in
location 72-75. Finally, the lagged adjustment factor was placed in
location 28. This variable is necessary to provide continuity in the per
share data when Compustat tapes of different vintages are spliced.

A parallel selection and reformatting was constructed using the old
Compustat tapes CIND5981, CRES5978.EDIT, and COTC61S2.FIX8O with the
following difference: all firms on these tapes (those in both the primary
and secondary columns of Table 4.1) were selected by data for long-lived

firms (more than 20 years old). This yielded a total of 1379 old
industrial firms, 166 old Research firms, and 495 old OTC firms. These
files (OLDCIND, OLDCOTC, and OLDCRES) were then reformatted by MKOLDIND,

MKOLDOTC, and MKOLDRES, yielding 45,927 firm-year observations in the same
format as CS8187.REFORNAT.

The same kind of selection and reformatting exercise was performed by
jobs SELRSIIJP, SELR84UP, SELR86UP, SELR87UP, and MKCR8187 to obtain the 735

firms in the secondary column of Table 4.1, yielding about 14700 firm-year
observations. This was done because occasionally firms exit from the main
Compuscat files before their last one or two years of data are recorded,

so that it is necessary to obtain the additional data from the Research

file, where the firm is placed after it exits. This is a very important
step if we are interested in pre- and post-acquisition behavior of firms.
The five reformatted files OLD... .REFORMAT, CS8187.REFOPJ4AT, and

CSR8187.REFORMAT were merged by MRCCS87 to make CS87SLEP.INPUT in the

28

following way: the files were sorted by firm and year; the primary file was

CS8187, which was merged with the OLD

files

so that only one firm-year was

taken for each observation, but with the most recent data (in terms of

vintage of the tape source). The file CSR8187 was then used to update this
data in such a way that no missing values were allowed to replace existing

data. This maximizes data availability for each firm.

I ended up with

about 73,000 observations, of which about 50,000 contained good data on

most of the variables. This means that there are on average about 17 years
of data per firm (out of 30 years possible at the maximum).
This file still needed to be updated for name and CUSIP changers; this
was done (twice, since some firms changed names twice) by the jobs CSS7NCR
and CS87NCR2, which changed all the CUSIPs on the name changers to the most

recent and then merged the data. The old names were saved on the early
observations so such a splicing can still be detected. The end result was
a file called CS87SLEP.INPUT with 49,225 good observations (since some

duplicate observations were deleted after the merging). This file was
reformatted back into a panel with 30 years of data per firm for use by the

SLEPIAI program.3

The final yield was 2726 firms (2897 less 171 name

changers).

The file CS87SLEP.INPUT was processed by the SLEPIAN program in order
to calculate the book values of the capital stock components adjusted for
inflation, the market value of the common stock, preferred stock, and long

term debt, and the stock of R&D capital. The list of the new variables
created by SLEPIAN is shown in Table 4.2; the output file from this

program (with the same 49,225 good records plus 32,795 phony records which

This program owes its name to Arthur Slepian, a graduate student at
Stanford University who wrote the first version for Brainard, Shoven, and
Weiss in 1978-79.

had been added to create a balanced panel) was called SLEPIAN.OUT.

This file was reformatted slightly by deleting the 32,795 bad records
and converting to fixed format in order to create the R&D Panel Master file

described in this document. A SAS file containing SAS missing value codes
was created at the same time.

The number of firms shown in the primary column is the number for which
the file is the original source of the firm data; this defines the sample.
The number in the secondary column is the number of firms for which
additional years of data were obtained from that file and spliced into :he
main observation.
The first file in each section (denoted 1978, 1980, and 1978
respectively) were actually merged versions of the older Compustat files
constructed for the earlier master file. The ones for the Industrial and
Research samples contained data for 1959 through 1981, and the one for OTC
contained data for 1960 through 1982.

APPENDIX A
EXITLIST Documentation:

Exits from the Publicly Traded Hanufacturing Sector 1977-1987

The EXITLIST dataset contains information on all the firms in the
manufacturing sector which exited from the Compustat Annual Industrial and

OTC Files between 1977 and 1987 (11 years of exits). The data which are
supplied are the reason for exit, the actual year of the exit, and the name

and CUSIP of the acquiring or other new firm if available. The data are
contained in an ASCII file on floppy diskette, one line per exit, sorted by

CUSIP number of the exiting firm. A complete listing of the variables on
the file is given on page 10.

The file was constructed in the following way: A list of firms which
were ever in manufacturing between 1976 and 1987 was constructed by
choosing firms from the old R&D Panel (the 1985 edition; see Hall et al.
1988), and augmenting this with any other firms which were ever in SIC 2000
through 3999 and which existed on the Annual Industrial files for 1981 or

1983 through 1987. From this combined and merged list I selected any firms
which had no data in 1987 and could thus be presumed to have exited for

some reason. This yielded a list of approximately 1200 firms which existed
on the files sometime between 1976 and 1986 but were not there in 1987, our

of a total panel of approximately 3000 firms. I also retained the year in
which each of the firms last had good data, and for some of them, the year
and reason for exit which is given on the Compustat Research file.1

1Since this file contains only firms deleted from the Industrial file,

I-J

:ng his li, en investigated more thoroughly in the ibrar': ::.e
reasons for exit. The first source was the Directory

Obsolete

Securities (1983, 1987, 1989), followed by the Capital Changes Reporter

(various dates through 1989). Both sources are extremely good at
identifying final acquirers (rather than just offers) as well as the price

paid for common. They also record Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 filings (both
of which I treat as bankruptcy, even though the firm may emerge from
Chapter 11 a few years later and reappear on Compustat) and liquidations

(the breaking up of the assets of the firm, with the shareholders receiving

the proceeds). Finally, they give the new names when the firm changes
names (leading to a change of CUSIP, and hence an 'exit" from Compusrat),
and they describe any recapitalizations or reorganizations which may have
occurred.

Neither of these sources clearly identifies the type of acquirer,

whether publicly traded, private, or foreign. Nor do they state clearly
whether the transaction was leveraged, although one can often tell by the

type of deal involved. To obtain this information, I used the following
strategies:

1) I identified publicly traded firms by finding them in the Compustat
files and recording their CIJSIPs (this enables one to match data for target
and buyer later on).

2) I identified private acquisitions from the list published by Lehn
and Poulsen (1989), and from various directories of public and private

corporations (Directory

Corporate Affiliations, Key British Enterprises,

etc.).

coverage after exit is incomplete for the OTC firms in the Compustat data.

36

3) I identified LBOs from the list supplied to me by Steven Kaplan
(Kaplan 1989) and from the Merger

Acguisition Sourcebook, which

identifies the type of transaction. This left me with quite a few
acquirers unassigned; those with PLC (the U.K.), AG (West Germany), NV
(Netherlands), AB (Sweden), SA (France or Switzerland), SpA (Italy), LTD
(the U.K. or Canada), or obvious foreign names were identified as foreign.

although if they had a CUSIP it was retained (some are traded directly or
as ADR shares on the U.S. stock exchanges and thus have data available).

_m

then looked up the remaiuder again in various

directories;

any subsidiaries were recoded to the name of the parent firm.

This

yielded

positive identification of public and foreign firms; any remaining puzzles

(very few) I coded as private. Public acquiring firms which are not on
Compustat or CRSP have a CUSIP equal to 0 on my list.

4) Finally, I verified that all acquirers and new names which had

CUSIPs were in my sample. Some were not, mostly because the firms had
changed industries and become non-manufacturing.

I added these firms to my

sample so that data from them would be available for post-merger analysis.
and I checked that these new firms had not also exited; for those which
had, steps one through four were repeated until I had all possible
acquirers.

The final list of exits contains 1224 firms and 6 variables. The data
on the list are the following:
1. CUSIP - -

The six-digit CUSIP of the firm which exited.

2. CNAME -- The name of the firm which exited.
3. ACQYR - - The year in which the actual acquisition, bankruptcy,
liquidation, or name change took place. This is not necessarily the
year in which the firm exited from the file; frequently it is later.
There will be exits up until 89, since data may disappear much earlier
from Cornpustat (and my sample is all firms which do not have data in

37

87 and possibly earlier years)

4. ACQRSN — A code telling why the firm exited from the file:
M The firm was acquired by another publicly traded firm.
P
The firm went private (or was purchased by a -rivately held firm).
FL The firm went private in a leveraged buvout.
F The firm was acquired by a foreign entity.
C
The fitm is controlled by another publicly traded firm and
has been deleted from the file by Compustat.

B
L

The firm went bankrupt (no real distinction between Chapter 7
and Chapter 11 in my data).
The firm was liquidated.

R

The firm underwent reorganization and may have later reappeared.
(This includes some bankruptcies).
NC The firm changed its name (and hence its CUSIF). The new name
and CTJSIP are shown as the acquiring firm.

NO After much investigation, no reason for exit was found and the firm
is still in existence.
D
The firm is still in existence and still (at least to a certain
extent) publicly traded, but it has been delisted from an exchange
and Compustat no longer carries its data.
5. ACTJSIP -- The CUSIP of the acquiring or liquidating firm, or
new firm if a name changer or recapitalizer.

6. ANAME - - The name of the acquiring, liquidating, or
reorganizing firm. Lower case entries provide other information about
the exit (or give generic purchasers, such as "employees").

APPENDIX B
The Construction of the R&D Stock Variable:
Interpolating the Missing Values of R&D

To construct a variable that measures the stock of R&D capital

owned by a firm, we use a method due to Criliches (1981; Criliches and

Mairesse 1981, Griliches and Hall 1982). This method is based on a
standard perpetual inventory equation with declining balance
depreciation:

(1) Kt — (1

-

6)

K + Rt
t—1

where K is the end-of-period stock of R&D capital and R is the
(real) expenditures during the year. The depreciation rate 6 is
chosen to be 15 percent per year; Criliches and Mairesse found that
the exact choice of depreciation rate made little difference in

production function estimates. This is not surprising since, if R&D
expenditures are roughly constant in real terms, the stock of R&D
capital is

K —

(1 -

6)S R

—

s—O

The variation across firms will then be approximately the same,
regardless of the value of 6 and the magnitude of the coefficient will

just vary inversely with 6. This means that separate identification
of 6 and the coefficient of K in an equation will be difficult.

i-o iA1ssing data problems must be confronted when making a stock

out of a series of flow variables: first, the problem of initial

conditions for the stock, and second, the fact that a single missing
value for R&D in one year will cause all the associated stock

variables to be missing. We solve the first problem by setting the
initial stock to the R&D expenditures in the first year divided by the
sum

of

the depreciation rate £ and a presample growth rate of new R&D

of 8 percent per year. Thus the individual stock is approximately
four times the level of R&D in the first year. The second problem is
solved as described below, by interpolation where there are only one

or two missing values in an R&D series. This procedure affects
relatively few firms.
