One could reject several potential explanations of the seemingly large
differences in the cost of capital; among these were:

The differences between the measured costs of capital were more apparent
for broad samples (AA 1988b) than for the selected samples of large
companies (AA 1988a);

Measures of the cost of capital based on market returns were closer for
the two countries than measures based even on corrected accounting data;

4. Conclusions

In this paper, we have attempted to clarify the implications of our
earlier work in two ways: by exploring reasons for an aggregate cost of
capital differential between the United States and Japan, and alternative

We judge our findings to raise as many questions as they answer,

explanations for observed differences between the countries in measured rates
of return.

The explanation remains

Notes:

The total is the sum of holdings by nonfinancial and financial
corporations and by households, reported at the market value.
Conceptually, it differs from the equity reported in Mikkei-Needs
tapes because (1) these figures apparently include equities of
financial corporations; and (2) equities held by foreigrers are
excluded.
It is our impression that the discrepancy due to these
conceptual differences is quite small. Economic Planning Agency,
Annual Reoore on National Accounts, 1990.

1. According to the August 1988 (p. 69) and 1989 (P. 47) issues of the Survey
of Current Business, the stock of Japanese direct investment capital in the
United States grew by 38.9 percent in 1986, 31.0 percent in 1987 and 51.8
percent in 1988.

2.The sharp drop in Japanese equity markets during the winter of 1989-90
occurred too recently to be accounted for in the data studied in this paper.
3. Although a market value of debt would be preferable, we have concluded in
the past that this correction would introduce new errors and is not
likely to
be as significant as the others we undertake.
4. There are further problems plaguing each measure that Prelate to the effects
of taxes on market value. If there is accelerated depreciation, then the
value of the firm's equity may be less than its replacement cost because. old
capital bears less valuable depreciation allowances than new capital.
Hence,
the true cost of capital, equal to the expected rate of return to new
investment before tax, will be lower than that implied by the corrected
accounting measure.

Equity value may also be lower than replacement cost if the marginal
source of equity funds is retained earnings.
In this case, again, the
earnings-price ratio will overstate the return to new equity investment. The
understatement will be less severe for the market-based measure, since only
the dividend yield (relative to the replacement cost of
capital) will be
overstated by the equity undervaluation.
For further discussion of such valuation issues, see Auerbach (1983).
We have not pursued this question here, due not only to the uncertainty about
which assumption about equity valuation is correct, but also because of our
view that such corrections are quite unlikely to be as significant as the
others we undertake in this paper.
