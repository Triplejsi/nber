WAITING FOR WORK

ABSTRACT

This paper explains upward job mobility and observed patterns of
unemployment by skill as an economy recovers from a recession. Skilled
unemployment is due to rational waiting by workers looking for long-term jobs
when there is a "lock-in" effect. Lock-in occurs if the conditions in the
labor market when a worker first accepts a job have a persistent effect on
wages. Using longitudinal data, we provide empirical evidence of the cyclical
pattern of wages predicted by the theory and also of lock-in.

I. Introduction

This

paper models cyclical upgrading and downgrading in the labor market.'

It shows that wait unemployment can arise as an equilibrium response to time
varying opportunities: workers who are laid off in a downturn rationally wait

to accept jobs until business conditions improve. Workers voluntarily remain
unemployed during recessions if they gain through waiting for permanently
higher wages which are available in the new jobs which appear during

expansions. Our empirical work provides new evidence of procyclic variation in
real wages of job takers. It also tests and strongly confirms the key
assumption of the model: workers hired in booms "lock-in' persistently high
wages and workers hired in busts suffer low wages for significant periods.
This paper is motivated in part by the observation that labor is not the

only factor of production which experiences periods of idleness. Office
buildings sometimes stand unoccupied for extended periods of time and oil

reserves sit idly underground. In the case of oil (and other exhaustible
natural resources), a well developed theory (Hotelling 1931) explains why the

owners wait to extract their resource. In the equilibrium of the Hotelling
model, the owners of oil reserves are compensated for waiting by an increase in
the price of oil at the rate of interest.

In contrast to oil, the use of office buildings in one period does not

preclude their use in other periods. In this respect, workers more closely
resemble office buildings than oil. Yet, in places like Houston, Texas and
Walnut Creek, California completed office buildings have been sitting vacant

for long periods. The Hotelling model can be adapted to explain the existence
of vacant office buildings provided that a significant fixed Cost must be borne

when office space is occupied or vacated. If such Costs are sufficiently
large, there is a "lock-in" effect: a building owner who rents his office space

today to one tenant forgoes the possibility of renting the same space in later

periods to other tenants. If long term rental rates increase more rapidly than
the rate of interest, it pays the owner of an unoccupied building to leave the

apace vacant and wait until conditions improve to rent out apace2. This is
true even if there are tenants willing to pay to occupy the space now. In
contrast, if the rental rates on long term leases increase at less than the
rate of interest, the building owner maximizes the present value of his income
by renting all available apace now, since the reward to waiting in the form of

higher rents in the future, does not make up for the loss in rentals today. In
analogy to the market for oil, in equilibrium, long term rental rates will rise
at precisely the rate of interest with the stock of excess office space being
gradually eliminated over time.

This paper develops and tests a theory of wait unemployment which is
exactly analogous to Hotelling's model as it would be applied to vacant office

space. Those workers seeking long term jobs experience cyclical unemployment
just as those office buildings whose owners seek long term tenants sometimes

have vacancies. The "labor supply" function in this model is perfectly elastic
and thus the model can rationalize the finding that large variations in

employment are accompanied by small procyclic variations in wages. Our model,
like that of Hansen (1985) and Rogerson (1988), accounts for large aggregate
fluctuations in employment without empirically implausible elasticities of

substitution betweem leisure in different time periods. Our model offers an
alternative rationale for a high elasticity of labor supply with respect to

transitory wage movements. If the wage were rising more rapidly than the rate
of time preference, a rational worker seeking long term work would optimally

wait for work, rather than coinit to the best job currently available. This

3
behavior occurs even if workers place no value at all on leisure.3
Analogously, the supply elasticity with respect to transitory changes in longterm rental rates is infinite in the Hotelling office-space model, even though
owners place no value on vacancies per Se.
The market for office buildings has two

important

features: in period.s of

glut, higher quality buildings typically have lower vacancy rates than lower
quality buildings; but lower quality buildings rent Out some space before

vacancies are completely eliminated in higher quality buildings. A model of
the market for office buildings should explain these correlations between
vacancies and quality type.

Our model explains the analogous correlations

observed between unemployment and skill: in recessions, more highly skilled
workers experience less unemployment than less skilled workers; but more highly
skilled workers do not fully bump less skilled workers in competitions for the
new jobs that become available as the economy emerges from recession, so that
skilled workers experience some unemployment.

In Section II we present the model. In Section III, we analyze how the
amount of wait unemployment and the path of wages vary across individuals as

the economy emerges from an exogenously-caused recession. The incidence of
wait unemployment (both its distribution across skill groups and its aggregate
amount) as well as the paths of wages over time by skill are endogenously
determined in our model in much the same way that the path of extraction of oil
over time and the length of time that must elapse before the oil is fully
depleted and a backstop technology comes into use is endogenously determined in

the Hotelling model. The ultimate causes of cyclical variations in labor
demand are not addressed in this paper and could result either from shocks to
aggregate demand or from shocks to productivity.

4

The model implies that the real wages of new job holders move

procyclically. In Section IV we present empirical results based on the
National Longitudinal Survey of Youth which strongly reinforce existing

evidence of this behavior. According to the key assumption of the model,
individuals who commit to low wage jobs in recessions do not realize rapid
market based wage adjustments when business conditions improve and the wages of

new entrants rises. Section V tests for such lock-in effects and finds strong
evidence of their existence. Section VI provides a summary.

II. Description of the Model
Our model of the labor market focuses on the determination of wages and

employment in the "spot market where newly created jobs are filled. The
number of new jobs created at each date and the wage distribution of these new

positions are exogenously determined. Workers vary in skill and employers fill
new jobs with the best workers available at the offered wage. Workers maximize
the present value of lifetime income. Wait unemployment occurs when an
individual who could obtain work today decides to hold out for better
opportunities in the future.

We use the model to characterize the equilibrium paths of wages and wait

unemployment by skill type as the economy emerges from a recession. Thus we
study how the labor market responds to a shock which initially destroys a
fraction of existing jobs leaving their occupants unemployed; we derive the
time paths describing the reabsorption of these workers into employment and the
wages they obtain as this occurs.

Our model is characterized by the following assumptions.

S

A. Assumptions Concerning Labor Supply
1.

At time 0, a shock occurs which leaves 8 people unemployed.

2. These people differ in skill. Skill is indexed by x, with x
uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.

3. Each unemployed person has an intertemporal utility function which
depends only on the present discounted value of lifetime income, with

discounting of future income at rate 6.
4. Workers' willingness to accept or reject jobs is determined by the
maximization of the present discounted value of lifetime income.

5. There is no uncertainty in the model and workers have perfect
foresight.

6. During a short period of time, dt, new workers arrive into the
unemployment pool at the rate

dt. This is a consequence of job destruction,

quits and new entry into the labor force. The skill of new entrants into the
unemployment pool is also uniformly distributed between 0 and I.

7. Workers who are unemployed receive a benefit which is a proportion, b,
of their 'steady state wage' w1, the wage that workers of that skill type earn
in a long run equilibrium with full employment.
B.

Assumptions Concerning Labor Demand
8.

Firms hire workers into jobs. Only one worker can fill one job.

9. New jobs arrive at the rate A dt.

10. Jobs are characterized by the wages they pay. A job of type w pays
the worker in that job a wage of w.

11. The distribution of wages of the A dt jobs which are created

between time t and t+dt is uniform between 0 and i. Accordingly, there is
a uniform distribution (of density A dt/) of jobs paying a wage w between 0

6

and .
12. A firm wishing to fill a vacancy selects the best worker willing to
accept its job offer at the time the vacancy appears.

13. Once the worker has accepted a job, he cannot leave it.
14. The wage paid on a job is constant forever (at its initial level).

C. Discussion of the Assumptions.

Three

points concerning labor supply merit discussion.

(1). The model lets workers choose between accepting a long-term job now,

or waiting until later to accept employment. There is no job quitting. This
assumption, which is so obviously extreme, enables the model to highlight the
implications of lock-in for the wait unemployment of long term job seekers.
Because workers are looking for long term jobs in the model, it is an important

empirical fact for us that much employment is in jobs of long duration. In
1978 male employees in manufacturing held jobs whose predicted average expected

tenure at completion was 18.6 years (Akerlof and Main 1981). The comparable
statistic for all employees for the same year was 12.5 years.

(2). In reality, many workers have low job switching costs, high rates of
time preference or severe liquidity constraints and are therefore willing to

accept short duration jobs. We could easily amend the model to include such
workers. In our model, these workers would experience unemployment only when
their respective "spot" wage falls below the value of their leisure and

unemployment benefits. The presence of such workers in our model would add to
the unemployment of long term job seekers.
(3). The workers in our model who are unemployed are well informed and
reject current jobs only in order to obtain better alternatives in the future.

7

Unemployed workers in our model are simply waiting, and not searching for jobs
since there is no stochastic element to the offers workers receive.
Four points concerning labor demand also merit discussion.

(1). The flow of new jobs occurs at an exogenous rate which is determined

outside the model. The defining characteristic of a job is the wage it pays.
The jobs which appear in any period pay a distribution of wages. We do not
address what determines the characteristics of new jobs created.5 The
determinants could be purely technological; alternatively, job creation could
be driven by fluctuations in aggregate demand.

(2). While wages are set exogenously, firms do not select job applicants
randomly. Instead job applicants are ranked according to ability, and firms
with job openings hire the most able workers willing to accept those jobs.
Thus the wage structure of jobs is fixed outside the model, but the wage for

workers of given ability is determined endogenously. Jobs which pay higher
wages obtain better workers. Competition among workers for jobs results in
"clearance" of the 'spot' labor market, at least for skilled workers. These
workers can always obtain some job by bumping less skilled workers in the
competition for newly created jobs.6
This assumption is contrary to the implication of most efficiency wage
models, that "overskilled" workers should be rejected by firms because they

receive insufficient rents to exert optimal effort.7 As a consequence, in most
efficiency wage models, skilled workers would experience job rationing. Our
assumption, however, closely corresponds to the two-stage institutional wage
setting commonly practiced in large organizations (see, for example, Henderson
(1982)). In the first stage, personnel managers establish "wage relativities",

using various evaluation schemes to decide on the appropriate relative rates of

8

pay of different jobs. In the second stage, firms use wage surveys to discover
the rates of pay offered by other employers in the area and decide on their

appropriate compensation level in comparison with other firms. Finally,
individual vacancies are filled by selection of the best available candidates

at these predetermined compensation levels. An expense preference theory of
managerial behavior which can be derived from principal-agent theory with
constraints on liability8, could theoretically rationalize such behavior. Katz
and Summers (1989), for example, have argued that such "rent-sharing" models
explain a wide range of empirical regularities concerning interindustry and

occupational wage differentials. This characterization of the labor market is
also in agreement with, for example, Reder (1955) and Okun (1973).

(3). In the model, firms pay newly hired workers quality-adjusted

wages

which may differ from those paid to workers hired previously.9 In booms, firms
discriminate against workers with high mobility Costs by failing to raise their

wage to the current market clearing level. Such discrimination may partly
explain why quits in the U.S. economy are procyclic (see Akerlof, Rose and

Yellen 1988). In booms, mobile workers leave 'bad' jobs which they

acquired in

recessions; the less mobile workers, whose behavior we model, remain stuck in
these 'bad' jobs.

(4). Our model assumes that the mean quality of newly created jobs

remains constant over time. Aggregate wages are virtually acyclic.° However
quality-adjusted wages vary procyclically as the average skill of new hires

into given quality jobs falls in booms. With the more realistic assumption
(See, for example, Okun

(1973)

or Barsky and Solon (1989)) that the average

quality of new jobs rises in booms, both quality adjusted and aggregate wages
would be significantly procyclic.

Solution

of

the Model

A solution to this model consists of a description of the equilibrium
paths both for the wage rate of each skill type and the unemployment rate of
each skill type at each date during the transition to the steady state as the
stock of initially unemployed workers, along with the flow of new entrants, is
matched with the flow of new jobs.'1 We viii denote these w(x,t) and u(x,t).
We will first describe the steady state of this model, in which there is no
unemployment, and then the approach to the steady state.

A. The Steady State
In the steady State unemployment disappears and the flow of new entrants
into the labor market is matched with the flow of new jobs.

New entrants and

new jobs flow into the labor market at the rates a dt and A dt respectively.

We will assume that a < A. Under this assumption, the flow of new jobs is more
than sufficient to provide employment to all new entrants into the labor force.
At each time, new entrants queue by skill and "slot" themselves in order of

quality into the flow of new jobs becoming available. In a steady state, the
wage received by skill type x, denoted w3(x), is determined by the equilibrium

condition that the number of new jobs paying at least v1(x) should just match
the number of incoming workers at least as skilled as x, leading to the

following equation

(1)

rrw
1
A
—
[J w(x) / Wdwjdt a(l-x)dt

The left hand side of (1) is the number of new jobs paying a wage at least as

great as w1(x). The right hand side of (1) is the number of workers at least

10

as skilled as x who are entering the unemployment pool. Solution of (1)
yields a specific formula for the steady-state wage w5(x)

(2)

w(x) —

(l

-

'A

(l-x)).

In the steady state with a < A, some newly created jobs are never filled. If,
contrary to our assumption, a > A, workers of skill type less than 1 -

A/a are

permanently unemployed.

B. Wages and

Unemployment Along the Path to the Steady State

Along an equilibrium path to the steady state, all jobs accepted by
workers of the same skill type must yield the same intertemporal utility. This
follows from the fact that individuals who maximize intertemporal utility will
never accept a job at any date t' if they can get higher utility by accepting a

job at another date, t". As a result, an initially unemployed worker of type x
receives utility U(x) dependent only on his skill type and not on the date of

job acceptance. Since firms give preference to more qualified job candidates,

workers of higher skill index x will receive jobs with a higher utility.
In order to solve for the path of wages received by a given skill type x

along the path to the steady state it is necessary to determine T, which is
the first date at which workers of type x receive the steady state wage and
also the last date at which they have any unemployment. The methodology is
similar to that used in a natural resource problem. In a natural resources
problem, the price path of a resource is computed conditional on the date of

first use of the backstop technology. Then the date of first use of the
backstop technology is determined by the condition that the demand for the

resource up to that date exactly exhausts the supply of the resource. T is

11
analogous to the date of use of the backstop technology. As in the natural
resource problem, the equilibrium wage path is computed conditional on TX.

Then T is determined by the condition that the demand for labor of type x
along the equilibrium wage path between 0 and T1 must match the supply of labor
of type x over the same period.

The Wage Path Conditional on T. The wage paid to skill type x at the
date T is the steady state wage, w1(x), given by formula (2). Knowing that

w5(x), it is possible to find the wages for type x workers at all

w(x, T1) —

preceding dates conditional on T1, since the present discounted valueof the
income stream of a worker accepting a job at t < T and at T must be the same.

A job accepted at T5 yields intertemporal utility TJ(x) which is the
sum of two components: the present discounted value of the income bw1(x)

received from unemployment insurance between 0 and T plus the present
discounted value of the steady state wage, which is received beyond T. This
utility is

The "reservation wage" of type x labor at time t, w(x,t), is then just that

wage which yields the same total utility U(x) for an initially unemployed
worker who instead accepts a job at date t < T. The utility from accepting a

job paying w(x,t) at t is

Computation of TX. To solve for T1 we equate the number of jobs created

between 0 and T which yield utility at least as great as U(x) with the
number of initially unemployed workers and new entrants to the labor force

between 0 and T with skills at least as great as x. In our example it is
possible to show that if type x labor has no unemployment at Tr then no higher

grade of labor will be unemployed. In consequence the number of new jobs taken
by labor with skill at least as great as x is the sum of two parts: the first
component is the stock of workers with skill at least as great as x who were

initially unemployed (at T they are all employed); the second component is
the flow between 0 and T1 of workers who entered the labor force with skill

at

least as great as x. (All of these workers will also be employed at T in jobs
which are at least as good as those taken by labor of type x.) There are
(l-x)8 workers who are initially unemployed, with skill at least as great as x

who become re-employed by date T1; and there are a(l-x)T workers who enter
the labor pool with skill at least as high as x. Consequently (l-x)9 +
(l-x)mT5 jobs are taken between 0 and T5 which are at least as good as the
jobs taken by workers of skill level x.

How many jobs preferable to those taken by group x are created between 0
and Tr? At time t the rate of such "superior" job creation is

where w(x,t) is the "reservation wage" of labor of type x. Any job paying a

paying w(x,t). Between 0 and T1 the total number of such jobs created is

To solve for T1, we equate the number of jobs created between 0 and T offering
utility at least as great as U(x), given by (7), with the number of initially

skills at least as great as x. This results in the equation

The Unemployment Path by Skill. The unemployment rate of type x labor at
time t, u(x,t), defined as the fraction of the initially unemployed workers of
this skill type who are still Out of a job at time t, can now be easily

obtained. At time T there is no unemployment of type x workers or workers
with greater skill. Therefore, for any t <

T,

the number of unemployed

workers at least as skilled as x plus the number of workers who will enter the

labor force between t and T with skill at least as great as x must equal the

14

number of new jobs which will be created between t and T5 with wages at least
as great as w(x,t):

The first term on the left hand side of (10) is the total number of

unemployed

workers with skill at least as great as x; the second term is the number of
new entrants to the labor market with skill at least as great as x between t

and T1. The right hand side of (10) is the total number of jobs yielding at
least as much utility as U(x) which are created between t and

T. The

unemployment rate of workers of type x at time t, u(x,t), is obtained by total

differentiation of (10) with respect to x. Use of (2) and (5) to substitute
for w(x,t) and use of (9) to compute dTddx yields the following simple formula
for the unemployment rate:

Differentiating (11) with respect to x and making use of the fact that T is
higher for lower x, it is easy to verify that, at each date, unemployment rates
are inversely related to skill; less skilled workers experience higher
unemployment throughout the transition to the full employment steady state.
The more skilled experience a more rapid decline in unemployment than the less

15
skilled, who linger longer in the unemployment pool as the economy emerges from

recession. Our theory thus rationalizes observed relations between
unemployment and skill.2 Higher skilled workers have lower unemployment rates
but unemployment is not confined solely to the lowest skilled workers in

recession. Although more skilled workers can always bump less skilled workers
for jobs, and thus there is no "involuntary" unemployment, there are

(endogenous) limits to the bumping that occurs. The rate at which skilled
workers currently take jobs determines the current wage gradient with respect

to skill. Too great a current skill/wage gradient makes it rational for
workers to wait rather than to take the jobs which are currently available to

them. Unemployment results so that the current skill/wage gradient is not too
steep.

As should be intuitive, an increase in

or decrease in A serves to

lengthen the amount of time it takes for the unemployment of any group to be

absorbed. The unemployment rate of each group at each date is also greater the
higher the unemployment benefit, b. These benefits raise an individual's
reservation wage path by providing positive income in periods in which waiting

occurs. As a consequence, individuals become more patient, in the sense that
their wages need to rise at a slower rate to make waiting worthwhile. In the
absence of unemployment benefits, wages must rise at the rate 6 in order to

compensate a worker for waiting. With unemployment benefits, the required race
of increase is approximately 8(1-b). Interestingly, although not shown in
equation 11, the taxation of the marginal unemployment benefits of workers of
greater skill will increase the unemployment of lower skill workers because it
will induce the higher skill workers to take up the jobs that would otherwise
be available to lover skilled workers.

Shzazlstions

Figures

1 and 2 illustrate the key properties of this model for sample

parameter values. The parameters which need to be chosen are 8, the percent of

the labor force initially unemployed, a, the rate of flow into the labor pool
as a fraction of the labor force, A, the rate at which new jobs are created,
b, the fraction of income replaced by unemployment insurance, and 8, the rate

of discount. We chose 8 — 5 percent; in other words, we supposed that a
recession started with 5 percent excess unemployment. The model does not
represent the unemployment of persons who are in the secondary labor market or

who are on temporary layoff waiting to be recalled. Nor does it reflect the
unemployment of those who are at the margin between being in and out of the

labor force. For this reason we chose a the flow into the unemployment pooi
to be quite low relative to total turnover. Total turnover in manufacturing is

60 percent per year. We chose a to be 5 percent per year. Further, we chose

b —

.5, and S — .1.

The major reason for choosing such a high rate of

discount is to mitigate the assumption in the model that jobs last forever.
Workers' leaving their jobs with a constant probability is similar to an

addition to the rate of discount in our model. The final parameter chosen was

A, the rate of job creation; A was chosen so that the length of the recovery
would be 36 months, the typical length of recoveries in the United States.

That is we chose, T0, the length of time for the lowest index labor to lose

all its unemployment to be three years. A was then chosen so that with the

values of a, b, 8 and 6 already selected, T0 would be three years
(according to formula (9) for T0). Figures 1 and 2 show simulated paths of
unemployment and wages with these benchmark parameters. It is worth noting how
modest the fluctuations in real wages are over this cycle.

Tasting for Cyclicality

In

the Wages of New Job folders

The next two sections of the paper present empirical tests of two key
features of our model. In this section, we demonstrate the validity of an
important implication of our model, namely that wages for individuals beginning

new jobs ("movers") are procyclic. We estimate that an exogenous one-point
increase in aggregate unemployment lowers real wages for movers by

approximately 3%. In the next section, we test an important assumption of our
model, namely, that wages of individuals who remain in jobs ("stayers") differ

significantly from those of movers. In particular, we test and reject the
hypothesis that the wages of stayers are as cyclic as those of movers.
Instead, we find that the wages of stayers persistently reflect the cyclic
conditions which prevailed when the job was first taken, so that individuals
who are hired during expansions "lock-in" persistently high wages.

We test our hypotheses using data drawn from the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth (NLSY).

The NLSY

is

a nationally representative panel of 6111

youth who were between the ages of 14 and 2113 in 1979. Detailed interviews

were conducted annually with the participants from 1979 through 1986. The NLSY
has suffered extremely low attrition; 92% of the original cohort answered the
1986 survey.

We use the NLSY

for

a number of reasons. This data set has not been

previously exploited by researchers, and it is interesting to compare our
results with those derived both from other NLS cohorts (e.g., the NLS cohort of
young men used by both Bils (1985) and Keane, Moffitt and Runkle (1988),

(hereafter "K"]), and from other micro-panels (e.g., the PSID used by Barsky
and Solon (1989), Blank (1987) and Mincer (1987)). Many young people have low
costs of job switching and change jobs frequently. Our

model

does not

explain

20
the unemployment

of

individuals who are willing to take short jobs at low

wages. Nevertheless, irrespective of the length of stay of the incumbents, the
wages obtained by young people in the spot market accurately reflects the

cyclical behavior of opportunities in the general labor market. The sample
period is of interest both because of its immediacy, and because it includes a
natural macroeconomic experiment, the deep recession of 1982.14
The assumptions of the theoretical model presented in Section II imply the
following structural wage equation for individuals acquiring new jobs:

—

(12)

where: Wit

f(u,

HKi, X)

is the (logarithm of the) real wage that individual i receives

at time t for job j that began at time s, s

The theoretical model presented above indicates that equation (13) is
relevant only for job movers, that is individuals who are in new jobs at time

t. In our empirical work, the universe of (13) consists of individuals who
started their current job (with a new employer) after the date of the last NLS

interview. We restrict our attention to individuals who are full-time workers
at least 16 years old. High school and full-time college students, as well as
the self-employed, are excluded from the sample.'5 The data is pooled across
years, so that some individuals account for multiple observations; for
instance, a person who moved before both the 1983 and 1986 interviews (and
satisfied all the other requirements) would account for two observations.

We attempt to take advantage of the rich array of data available in the

NLSY. The vector HK contains the following variables: a) age; b) sex dummy; c)
poor health dummy; d) number of dependents; e) a dummy for individuals who are
married with spouse present); f) five race dummies; g) three religion dummies;
h) dummies for individuals with non-native mother and non-native father; i)
experience (measured as the number of 2000-hour work-years) and its square; j)
dummies for high-school and college graduation; k) years of education; and 1)

ten scores from a battery of vocational aptitude tests.'6'7 The X vector
contains dummies for residency in: the South; a non-SMSA area; and a rural

area. The regressand is the natural logarithm of the hourly wage rate (in
cents) deflated by the aggregate GNP deflator (1982—1.). We use the
unemployment rate for all workers as a percentage of the labor force including
resident Armed Forces; this rate peaked at 9.5% in 1982-1983.

22
OLS estimation of (13) produces the results in the first two columns of

Table 1 below. Standard errors are reported in parentheses; sample averages of
the regressors are tabulated in the column on the extreme right of the table.
Coefficients which are significantly different from zero at the .01 (.05)

confidence level are marked with two (one) asterisks. The equations fit the
data well; the adjusted R2 of .22 compares favorably with other results

(e.g. the OLS wage equation of KMR has an adjusted R2 of .05). RMSE" denotes
the root mean squared-error of the residual.

The unemployment rate enters (13) with a coefficient of -

.028, indicating

that an exogenous increase in the unemployment rate of one point (from say 7%

to 8%) is associated with a 2.8% decline in the real wage. The coefficient is
estimated with great precision; the associated t-statistic is 5.2. By
comparison, Bils (1985) finds that a one point increase in the unemployment
rate is associated with a fall of between 3.5% and 4% in the real wage for job

changers. Bils finds a semi-elasticity of between - .015 and - .02 for all
individuals (including job stayers); KMR estimate a much smaller response
(between -.005 and -

.012 and - .029.

.01).

Mincer (1986) estimates a semi-elasticity of between

The estimate of 2.8% accords closely with the theoretical

prediction of the model for reasonable parameter values.
Our estimate of (13) implies wage cyclicality which is both statistically

significant and close in magnitude to the prediction of the theory. However,
other aspects of (13) are also of intrinsic interest. The results in Table 1
are, for the most part, quite consistent with much of the received wisdom in

labor economics. Worthy of note are: 1) the large but declining return to
experience; 2) the significant positive effects of both college graduation18

and additional years of education; 3) lower average wages for females but

OLS

estimation

of (13) ignores the potentially important effects of sample

selection bias. Such issues have been recently stressed by KMR (see also Bus
(1985)). At least two distinct types of sample selection bias are potentially

important. First, (13) is only estimated for movers. However, at least some
movers are individuals who quit their old jobs in order to take advantage of

idiosyncratically higher wages. As quits are known to be procyclic, ignoring
such self selection may lead the econonietrician incorrectly to estimate a

countercyclically biased semi-elasticity. More importantly, an individual must
be currently employed to enter the universe of (13). The theoretical model
above argues that high quality workers constitute a disproportionate number of

new job movers during recessions. As a consequence, in our model, wages
adjusted for 'true' quality tend to fall during recessions, although

"aggregate wages are acyclic. If labor quality is imperfectly observable, the
econometrjcian who ignores sample

selection

bias will estimate an unemployment

rate coefficient which is counter-cyclically biased.
We have checked the robustness of our results to both types of potential
sample selection biases by using the popular two-step "Heckit" estimator;
Heclanan (1979) provides the classic analysis. Heckit analysis proceeds in two

steps.

First a probit equation is used to estimate the sample selection rule;

then a function of the probit residuals which corrects the sample selection

25
bias is added to the equation of interest (in our case, (13)). As we are
concerned with two potential types of sample aelection biaa, we estimate two

types of probit equations.'9 The more important compares movers to the
remainder of the sample (e.g., including unemployed workers); the second

compares movers only to employed stayers. We then include the sample selection
correction in (13) and re-estimate our equations for movers. Results which
include a sample-selection correction (for movers vs all others) are included

in Table 1 in the third and fourth columns. Consistent with the results of
Bils (1985) (but not KMR), the results do not indicate significant sample
selection bias; this is true of both types of potential sample selection bias.
An interesting alternative way to avoid sample selection of the
mover/stayer variety, is to examine the wages of individuals leaving school and

entering full-time employment for the first time. The wages of school-leavers
are highly procyclic: if (13) is estimated for the universe of school-leavers,
the coefficient on the unemployment rate is - .039 with a standard error of

.009. This estimate is similar to that derived from (13) above. Nevertheless,
there is clearly an element of choice in the timing of the decision to finish

school and enter the labor force. While we suspect that such considerations
are not very important, they lead to a countercyclic bias in the unemployment
coefficient (insofar as individuals avoid entering the labor force and taking
low-wage jobs during recessions).

We have also checked our results for robustness with respect to a number

of other perturbations of our basic methodology. We have added lags of the
wage rate to the right-hand side of (13). We have used CI..S, weighting

observations by national sampling weights. Alternatively, we have used
standard errors which are immune to arbitrary forms of heteroskedasticity. We

26

have used different definitions of two of the key variables in (13): 1) the CPI
has been substituted for the CNP deflator; 2) three alternative neasures of the
business cycle have been used in place of the aggregate unemployment rate: (a)
the employment/population ratio; b) the aggregate unemployment rate for youth;
and c) the (individual-specific) local area unemployment rate, both with and

without year effects. Finally, we have restricted the sample in five different
ways: 1) excluding earlier years of the sample; 2) eliminating outliers; 3)
restricting the sample to non-unionized workers; 4) estimating
(13) on an industry by industry basis; and 5) estimating (13) separately for

each of eleven occupation groups. However, none of these exercises removes or
substantially weakens our finding of substantially procyclic wages.
We note in passing that adding industry or occupation controls to (13)
only slightly (and insignificantly) reduces the degree of wage cyclicality,
indicating that wage cyclicality does not exist solely because individuals
receive the opportunity to move to high-wage sectors or occupations during
expansions (as proposed by Okun (1973)).

grounds. As in the estimate of (13), these results are also robust. For
instance, if year effects are added, they are insignificant, and
(insignificantly) change the coefficient on the unemployment rate to -

.031.

Alternatively, if the (change in the) local area unemployment rate is used
instead, the point estimate is quite similar (-.022), with a t-statistic of

721
To summarize, evidence from the NLSY panel is quite consistent with the
hypothesis that the real wage for movers is significantly procyclic in both the

economic and statistical senses. We now proceed to the second of our
objectives, namely testing for real wage "lock-in".

V. Testing for "Lock-In"
The objective of this section is to test for a "lock-in" effect on real

wages. "Lock-in" occurs if individuals who stay in jobs have wages which are
significantly less cyclic than wages of comparable individuals who move into

new jobs. In the extreme case used in the theoretical model, real wages of
movers are procyclic, but the wage of an individual who is hired at time c for

wage w remains fixed at w for as long as the individual remains in the job.
One way to test for lock-in is to estimate an analogue to (13) for stayers

as well as movers. We use the following trivial generalization of (13):

In the absence of any lock-in effect, fi

is

identical for movers and

stayers; in contrast, in our theoretical model lock-in is complete so that fi

is

zero for stayers. To test for lock-in, we estimate (15) separately for movers

29
and stayers and test the hypothesis that the

of stayers is significantly

lover than the coefficient for movers.

Estimates of (15) for movers and stayers are tabulated in Table 322
While the coefficients in the movers and stayers equations resemble each other

closely in many respects, the wages of movers are much more cyclic. In
particular, the coefficient on the unemployment rate for stayers is one-quarter
of the comparable coefficient for movers; further, the hypothesis that the
wages of stayers are acyclic cannot be rejected at conventional significance
levels.23 The conclusion that the wages of movers and stayers have differing

cyclicality is not unique to this study; Bus (1985) has reached similar

An alternative test for lock-in uses the following equation:

To understand this equation, consider the wage of a man who began his job

in the recession year 1982 and remained in the same job through 1986. The wage
of this worker would exhibit lock-in if his 1986 wage was still (adversely)

affected by his initially low 1982 wage. Alternatively, if the man's wage
moved one for one with the wages of active participants in the spot labor
market, then there would be no persistent effect of the low initial wage and

thus no evidence of lock-in. Absence of lock-in can be conveniently

parameterized as r1—l, r2—O; partial lock-in can be expressed as r1<1, r2>O;

complete lock-in (as assumed in the theoretical model) implies r1—O, r—l.
Equation (16) cannot be estimated without generating data for
Conceptually, this is the wage that, a woman who stayed in a job through say
the 1984 interview would have gotten if she had actually moved during 1984;
alternatively, it can be viewed as the wage that movers with observable

characteristics identical to those of the woman actually get. We generate
Wit.(t) by estimating (13) for movers, and using the fitted coefficients (along

with the regressors of stayers) to generate jtJ(t)

for

stayers.25 Traditional

standard errors may not be correct insofar as i,t,j(t) is a generated regressor;

consequently, we estimate standard errors through a parametric bootstrap, using
1000 replications •26

The results indicate that the wages of stayers are substantially affected

by both their initial wage and the contemporaneous wage of movers. There is
strong evidence of partial lock-in; both the extreme hypotheses of complete and
of no lock-in can be easily rejected at all conventional significance levels.
Note that the initial wage is not adjusted for tenure or experience in any

32
way.27

Equation (16) may be criticized insofar as no dynamics are included;

alternatively, (16) can be viewed as a steady state target. Accordingly, we
have estimated a series of dynamic models, including the following partialadjustment models:

The significance of the initial wage in (20) indicates that the wages of
stayers do not converge asymptotically to the spot market wages attained by

movers. Thus, (20) provides evidence of significant "hysteresis" in wage
determination of stayers. Even if the possibility of hysteresis is ignored, as
in (19), the speed of adjustment of the wages of stayers to the wages of movers

is not very high; the mean lag is over two and a half years. We conclude that
accounting for dynamics, at least in this simple way, does not reverse our
finding of partial lock-in.

For yet another test of lock-in, we mechanically first-difference (13)
across time obtaining potentially different equations for "stayers", "single
movers", defined at those in a new job at time t

A rigorous test of the hypothesis that the unemployment rate coefficients

are equal for stayers and movers can be computed by pooling observations. The
test indicates that stayers and double movers (but not stayers and single

movers) have different cyclic wage patterns. Using the aggregate unemployment
rate, the t-test is 2.4 for stayers vs double movers (with a marginal
significance level of 1.9%); for stayers vs single movers, the t-statistic is

.8 (with a marginal significance level of 45%). Thus double movers, but not
single movers, appear to have wages which are significantly more cyclic than
those of stayers at traditional significance levels.

The results indicate that less than one-fifth of the wage growth of movers

is reflected in the wage growth of comparable stayers. Incorporating a variety
of dynamics does not change this conclusion.

VI. Siary
This paper has presented a theory of unemployment and wages by skill for

an economy emerging from a recession. It has provided an equilibrium theory of
upward mobility in a higit pressure economy as observed by Okun (1973). In
booms, workers of all qualities who are in the job market get better jobs than

they can get in recession. Workers are sufficiently dissatisfied with the jobs
available to them in recessions that some of them choose to wait rather than to

work. Those who choose to wait are unemployed; the number of them is
endogenously determined so that the reward to waiting due to the procyclic
movement in real wages compensates for the lost income from current

unemployment. We have shown that wages in the spot market, for workers
currently taking jobs, improves significantly as the unemployment rate

declines. Also, workers who take jobs in recessions experience lock-in: the
wages received in those jobs do not rise to match the improvement in the spot
market.

is more elastic than it would be in the absence of such insurance because
unemployed workers experience no consumption decline. Hansen and Rogerson assume
either that individuals' preferences or the technology exhibits a nonconvexity
with respect to labor supply so that individuals either work full time or not at
all, with the outcome determined by a lottery in each period.

4. The presence of such workers at the beginning of a recession typically leads
to greater depression of quality-adjusted wages and thus increases the incentive
to wait for workers with high switching costs or low rates of time preference.

S. In the model constructed, firms do not substitute teams of low paid, low
skilled workers to perform the jobs of individual high skilled workers. This
differs from the usual representation of production with labor of different skills
in which different workers embody different efficiency units of labor and output
is a function of the total labor input, in efficiency units, and capital. In such
a model output is the same with one skilled laborer embodying one labor efficiency
unit or two unskilled laborers each embodying one half labor efficiency unit. In
contrast, in our model, the good laborer would not be a perfect substitute for the

two poor laborers. Production is organized into jobs and only one laborer can

interview study by Michael Piore (1968), who found that job descriptions were not
responsive in the short-run to relative prices.

6. Davis and Haltiwanger (1989) and Leonard (1987) have shown that the labor
market is characterized by large gross flows of job creation and job destruction

so that A is large. In such an environment, it seems highly implausible that
skilled workers would be unable to bump less skilled workers for jobs if they
wanted them.

7. In the models of Shapiro and Stiglitz (1985) and Salop (1979), for example,
workers who are overskilled would have insufficient incentive to work rather than
shirk, or to remain on the job rather than quit.
8. In the usual principal agent model, a principal designs a compensation scheme
to control a manager who cares not only about her compensation but also about her
own effort. If a manager hires outside labor and can obtain labor which is easier
to manage by paying a higher wage, the theory is formally identical with "wages

39
to those managed" substituted for "effort' in the standard principal/agent model.
If first-best contracts are obtained, then expense preference will not occur. But
first-best contracts can only be obtained under conditions which are impractical
in most labor contracts.
Sappington (1983) has shown that the imposition of
limits to the extraction of payments from managers to firms results in contracts
considerably different from first best. Such contracts are likely to result in
suboptimal effort of managers, in the usual principal agent model, or an excess
of expense preference in a model where managers are hiring other inputs.

9. The existence of "two-tier" pay structures in the airline industry provides
an example of how wages paid to new workers may be lower than the wages paid to
workers with seniority. In academia, it is commonly alleged that new hires are
paid more than equally qualified workers who are locked in. Our empirical work
in Section IV shows that wage adjustments of existing workers to the current

"spot wage" occurs slowly.

Our model makes the extreme assumption, for

simplicity, that no such adjustment occurs.

10. Aggregate wages in our model are slightly procyclic because not all newly
created jobs are taken. As recovery occurs, the wage cut off of newly taken jobs
rises.

11. Lucas (1974) emphasized that both wages and unemployment should be jointly
determined in a full equilibrium model. Our model provides an alternatire to
that exposited by Lucas.
12.

For example, when the unemployment rates of sex-education groups are

regressed on the aggregate unemployment rate, the coefficients for both men and
women decline with increasing education. Further, in the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth, the incidence of unemployment is negatively correlated with a
variety of measures of labor quality.

13. Actually 22.
Nevertheless, the NLSY does have some potentially important drawbacks.
First, the temporal span of the data is shorter than that of other tapes; we
focus on the seven years of data from 1980 through 1986. Also, the NLSY does
not have data on some variables of potential interest. For instance, there are
14.

no measures of overtime pay, which is the subject of considerable interest (Bils
(1985), KMR).
15.

We have also considered both more and less restrictive universes.

In

particular, we have restricted our universe to individuals who left their previous
job for a reason other than: being laid off; fired; or becoming pregnant. We have
also enlarged our sample to include school leavers (with no previous employer).
Our results are typically insensitive to our exact choice of universe.

16. Our thirty-two controls exclude the labor force size variable used by Bils
because t is unavailable in the NLSY.
Otherwise, our controls encompass the
complete list of previously used controls. Both Bils and KMR use a total of four
HK controls.

17. The vocational aptitude tests measure knowledge and skill in the following

areas: 1) general science; 2) arithmetic reasoning; 3) word knowledge; 4)
paragraph comprehension; 5) numerical operations; 6) coding speed; 7) auto and
shop information; 8) mathematics knowledge; 9) mechanical comprehension; and 10)
electronics information. These tests are used by the armed services to determine
eligibility and assignment qualifications for specific military jobs for new
enlistees; the scores are also used as measures of trainability, and as primary
criteria of enlistment eligibility for the armed forces. The NLSY members were
paid $50 each to take the battery of tests.

18. High-school graduation is associated with a wage decline, but this result
is of marginal statistical significance and is quite sensitive to the exact
specification of (13).
19. The regressors in the probit equations are identical to those in (13).
20. Note that the differencing is taken over jobs, rather than over time.
21. The local area unemployment rate provided by the NLS is categorical, so that
the semi-elasticity discussed in the text is an implied semi-elasticity.

22. Of course, the estimates for movers are identical to those of Table 1.
23. If the other regressor coefficients are equated for both movers and stayers,
the hypothesis that the unemployment coefficient is equal for the pooled sample
of both movers and stayers can be easily rejected; the t-statistic is over 12.

24. In contrast, Barsky and Solon (1989), using the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics, find only small and statistically insignificant greater cyclicality of

wages for classes of workers with many stayers in comparison with classes of
workers with many movers. However as Rarsky and Solon discuss, stayers and movers
cannot be classified precisely in the PSID because of its lack of precision in
labor force histories.

25. Results adjusted for sample selection bias are not significantly different;

this is not surprising, as we have not found significant evidence of sample
selection bias.

26. The generated regressor problem does not easily fit into the framework of
Pagan.

27. Adding in tenure in a variety of ways (such as an independent regressor, or
as an interaction with the initial wage) only strengthens evidence of lock-in.
