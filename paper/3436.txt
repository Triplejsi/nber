We use a series of household surveys fran these t.n rintries to present

inccne aid consumption can be detected in the data. The fact that few of the

elderly live alone makes it diffiailt to acourately iiean the welfare

o Introduction
This paper presents and discusses somefacts about older people in two contrasting

developing countries, ate d'Ivoire and Thailand, We shall be concerned with standard
questions in the aging literature, namely demographic structure, living arrangements,
urbanization, illness, labor force behavior, and economic status. In this paper, we shall
go little beyond the presentation of data from a series of household surveys from the two
countries. Although recent years have seen an inaeased attention in the demographic and

sodological literatures to questions of aging in LDC's, data are still relatively scarce,
particularly for Africa, and we see our current task as providing stylized facts to help
focus further discussion.

There are two research issues that provide the structure for our discussion;
household saving behavior, and, more broadly, the economi of aging in countries with
low living standards but with rapidly expanding shares of-old people in the population.
Research on savings behavior in the United States, Japan. and Western Europe has
been dominated by permanent income and life-cyde models since their introduction in the
1950's. There has been a good deal less work on household saving behavior in LDC's, and

much of the work that has been done has simply transferred the analytical framework

from the more to the less developed context. It is not dear that this is the best way of

proceeding. While it makes sense to work with the same basic ideas, that saving an
smooth consumption over time, and that assets provide a measure of insurance against
an uncertain future, there are important differences in environment and in mechanisms,

so that the same aims may be achieved in very different ways. A much larger share of
the population in developing countries is engaged in agriculture, where incomes are very
variable, and there are many poor people close to subsistence, so that consumption insurance may be of the greatest importance.
Household size is typically larger in poorer countries. Extended families, or even
simply large households, may play many of the roles that are performed by asset markets

in more developed economies, so that, for example, wealthy older men may acquire
additional young wives as an alternative to an annuity. At the same time, the internal
organization of the family and its living arrangements are intimately tied to patterns of
inheritance, so that the means of transferring assets from one generation to the next will
themselves vary with household sthacture. Age composition within very large households

may not vary very much over time, so that main motive for saving becomes the protection of living standards from short-term covai-iate risk, and has little to do with

transferring resources between generations or between widely separated time periods.
One of the issues we examine in this paper is the extent to which there are dearly defined
economic and danographiccharacteristics of households that vary systematically with the

ages of their members, particularly characteristics that are likely to provide motives for
saving.

•A number of broader issues have been raised in the literature on aging in LDC's,

and these also play a role in shaping our discussion. The dominant demographic fact for
LDC's is the effect of the demographic transition on raising the fraction of old people in

the population. In Thailand. where the demographic transition is largely complete, the

share of over 60's in the population, which was 6.2% and 5.7% In 1960 and 1985
respectively, is expected to rise to 11.9% in 2020, United Nations (1986), figures which are

repeated in much of South. South East, and East Asia, as well as in Latin America. United

Nations (1987) lists 3.8,3.5,5.1 and 43 as the percentages aged 65 and over for these four

regions in 1980, whereas the estimated figures for 2000 are 4.8,4.6, 7.8 and 5.2, rising in
2025 to 8.2,83,133, and 8.3. In Africa, where by contrast, there has been little decline in

the rate of population growth, the percentages aged 65 and over are 3.1, 3.0, and 3.9 in
1980, 2000, and 2025. The two countries discussed in this paper are good examples of
these two contrasting cases.
It is also important to note that life-expectancy for older people in LDC's is high,
and although not as high as in Japan or the United States, the difference is much smaller
than the corresponding differences at birth. Life expectancy at birth in North America is
72.4 years for men, and 80.1 years for women, and at age 60, men can expect to live for

17.8 years and women for 21.8 years. In South Asia and Africa, respectively, life
expectancy at birth is 59.4 and 54.1 for men, and 60.2 and 57.4 for women, while at age

60, the figures are 15.1 and 143 for men, and 163 and 15.9 for women, see Treas and
Logue (1986) for these and other figures. Since women live longer than men, higher life-

expectancy for all tends to exaggerate the predominance of women over men in the
population, so that the ratio of males to females tends to decline with the level of
development. In the more developed countries in 1980, there were 62 males per 100
females aged 65 and over, compared with 82 per 100 in Thailand and 80 per 100 in China,

and In parts of South Asia where there is excess mortality among women, there are more

men than women in the older age groups, see Martin (1988). Several West African
countries also show a predominance of men over women, USAID (1982).

The growing relative importance of the elderly, particularly in Asia, has led to an

increased academic and policy debate minoring much of the earlier debate in more
developed economies. Two excellent reviews are provided by Treas and Logue (1986),
and for Asia, Martin (1988). One of the dominant themes of this debate is the contrast
between the status of the elderly in more and less developed countries. There are extreme

idealized versions of both types of sodeties. To some, the extended family provides
insurance for old-age, unemployment, and sickness, as well as an environment in which
the elderly are an integrated, useful and respected part of their families. This is seen as
a stark contrast to the "Western" treatment of the old, whereby they are unproductive,
isolated, and institutionalized, with social insurance providing only a poor substitute for
family Insurance. Cowgill (1974.1986, Chapter 8) sees the victimization of the elderly as
a natural concomitant of development, with education, urbanization, and technical change

as "processes that strip the old of daizns to respect, power, and independence." Treas and
Logue (1986, p.6661. To others, the security of the extended family is a romanticized myth

that appeals mostly to those who have long escaped the grinding poverty, poor health
conditions, and low life-expectancy with which it is typically associated. One person's iso-

lation is someone else's individual freedom. It is perhaps not surprising that Asian policy
makers, faced with the prospect of rapidly increasing absolute and relative numbers of old

people, view Western systems pensions, social security, and public geriatric care with a

mixture of envy and alann.
These "big" questions of the effect of development on the status of the elderly are
not sufficiently well posed to be amenable to serious empirical evaluation. Nevertheless,
good work has been done on more specific issues, particularly on the living arrangements

of the elderly. Martin (1989) reviews a number of studies of Asian populations which
suggest that the proportion of the elderly living with their children, althougb still high
(typically between 70% and 80%) is declining over time, with a corresponding increase In

the numbers living alone, a pattern that is consistent with a move towards living
arrangements such as those in the U.S., where only 15 percent of the elderly live with their

children.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 is concerned with
individuals, and reviews demographic characteristics and living arrangements for elderly
people in COte d'lvoire and Thailand. It also presents data on urbanization, on health, on
labor force partidpation and hours worked, and, to the extent possible, on levels of living.

Section 2 is concerned with households, and looks for "life-cycle" type patterns in household

size, Income, and consumption patterns in relation to the ages of household members.
Section 3 summarizes and concludes.
1. Individual characteristics and age

Lisaniple data and population chancteristia
The data presented in this paper come from two series of household surveys from

ate d'Ivoire and Thailand. ate d'lvoire is listed by the World Bank (1989) in the lower
middle-income division of its middle-income category with per capita GM' in 1987 of $740,

which grew at an annual average per capita growth rate of 1.0% from

1965-87.

Its

population in 1987 Is estimated as 11.1 million, and grew at an annual rate of 4.2% during

both1965-S0and1980-87. Theaudebirthrateperthousandwas5zinl9osandslin
1987, while life expectancy at birth in 1937 was 52 years. Thailand has a similar GNP of
SS50, but has had much faster growth, averaging 3.9% from 1965-87. if these figures can
be taken seriously, the average Thai was 280% richer in 1987 than in 1960, as opposed to

an inaease of only 30% for Ivorians over the same period. Whatever the precise
magnitude, young Thais are now very much better off than were their parents, either in
tenns of lifetime resources, or in tenns of income at the same age, and this is much less
true for young Ivorians. There were 53.6 million Thais in 1987, with a life expectancy at
birth of 64 years. The population growth rate was 2.9% from 1965-80, 2.0% from 1980-87,

and is projected to be 15% from 1987- 2000; the aude birth rate per thousand fell from
41 to 25 between 1965 and 1987.
The Ivorian surveys are the Living Standards Surveys of 1955 and 1986, collected
by the Department of Statistics of COte d'lvoire with the technical and analytical support

of the World Bank. The survey design Is described in Ainsworth and Mufioz (1986), and

is a non-ftadjtional one, carried out on a simple random sample of 1600 households in
each of the two years. with 800 households common to both surveys. Although the
number of households is small compared with traditional designs, there are around 14,000

individuals in each of the two surveys. The emphasis is less on large sample size than on

the collection of comprehensive data for each household, so that interlinkages between

different economic and activities can be studied. The Thai surveys are the two
Socioeconomic Surveys of the Whole Kingdom, collected by the National Statistical Office

in the two years 1981 and 1986. These surveys are more like the traditional household
4

income and expenditure surveys, they have sznple sizes in excess of 12,000, they have no
panel element, and there is less detailed infohnation about many of the activities covered

i.ntheLivingStandardsSurveys. Evenso,forthepurposesofthispaper,thetwosetso(
surveys provideroughly equivalent informationThere are earlier household surveys for Thailand which could be used to examine
the same issues over a longer time period. However, after the 1975 survey, the definition

of the household was changed so as to exclude sub-unit households so that, for example,
in 1975 a married son and his wife living with parents would have been Included as part
of the parents' household, but not in later surveys. As a result, It is not possible to make
consistent comparisons about living arrangements over the two types of survey. This

seemingly technical issue points to a deeper problem in the measurement of household
structure in Thailand and, indeed, in developing countries in general. To quote Cowgill
(1986, p.70),
"In Thailand, however, the term household Is somewhat elusive and ambiguous. The climate Is
semi-tioplal. and a great portion of one's life is spent out-of-doors. To a very great extent, this
Includes cooking, eating, and visiting. Thus the physical stnidure of the home Is little more
than Wbedn,om situated within a compound, while the cooking. eating, bathing. visiting. and
even much of the working takes place in.the compound rather than in the physical saucture of
the home. Hence when we say that the young married couple lives with the parents of one of
them, the young couple usually sleeps In a separate structure within the parental compound.
This usually involves common cooking and eating facilities, but this too Is flexible, especially
since eating is more of an lndividuai matter and less often a scheduled gioup activity. Western
definitions of household membership are not easily applied in this type of society."

These Issues must be constantly borne in mind when interpreting the figures given below.

In particular, the "new" treatment of the household in the Thai surveys is likely. to overstate
the degree to which people live either alone or in small groups,

and to understate house-

hold size. By contrast, the Ivorlan survey used a more inclusive concept of the household,
and tended to include subunits if they lived in the sante compound. As a result, house-

hold size in the surveys is larger than household size in the 1975 Ivorian census, and the

biases may be in the opposite direction from those in Thailand.
Figures 1 and 2 show the age pyramids and sex ratios for Bangkok and for rural
Thailand in 1981 and 1986. while Figure 3 provides the same information for COte d'lvolre.

For most of the paper, we shall follow this practice of showing data for Bangkok and for
rural Thailand, rather than for the more conventional urban-rural split. Bangkok contains

nearly 70% of Thailand's urban population, and while the survey also collects data on
other urban and semi-urban (sanitary district) data, these seem sufficiently different from
Bangkok to merit separate treatment. In order to avoid a three, or possibly four way split
5

for each table, we compromise with two. For the same reason, and when it is not misleading to do so, we shall normally present data from the 1986 Ivorlan survey. On
balance, the data from the second year are probably of somewhat higher quality.
There are a number of problems with the lvorian data that are apparent from the
figures. although none are particularly serious for older people. There is vey pronounced
peaking at five year age intervals, particularly in 1985, and particularly among females.
Such effects are not uncommon among uneducated populations, see for example Ewbank
(1981, pp. 66-68) and are typically correlated with low education and low Incomes; the
1975 Ivorian

Census shows similar effects, see Ahonzo, Barrere, and Kopylov (1984. p.9).

In 1986, interviewers placed less reliance on reported figures, and acquired more
supporting information, and the problem is considerably reduced. Even so, it is wise not
•to make much of the precise age estimates, and to work instead with five or ten year age

brada

More serious is an apparent undercount of prime age males; in 1986 the sex

ratios (males per 100 females) in theage groups 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44,45-49, and
50-54, are, respectively, 85.1,74.2,83.2,65.3,60.7,78.9. and 77.6, with between 600 and 200

people in each sex-age cell, see Figures

b and 3d. Neither we nor the World Bank

currently have any explanation for these results. Again, there are similar, although not
identical problems with the 1975 Census, and other demographic surveys, as well as with
census data in other African countries. Ahonzo, Barrere and lCopylov (1984, Chapter 5),
find similar patterns in surveys carried out in the early sixties, as well as in the 1975
Census once the predominantly young, male non-Ivorian immigrants (22% of the

pou-

latión) are removed. Although the Living Standards Surveys include non-nationals, there
are only 14% in the two surveys in 1985 and 1986. Since it Is the same age group missing
in data ten years apart, and since there is no large-scale emigration from COte d'Ivoire, the

problems must come from measurement errors, possibly in connection with the many
prime-age males in the cities, where they are hard to count or survey. Respondents may
also exaggerate their ages, and it Is possible that men do so more often or by more than
do women. The figures for the fractions of old people appear to beconsistent with those

from the Census, again see Ahonzo a a? (1984), and USAID (1982);note that once again
differential oveneporting of age by nien may account for at least part of the apparent
excess of older men.
Tables 1.A.and 1.B show the fractions of people, by sex and urbanization, who are

aged over 55 in both Thailand and COte d'lvoire. We have chosen the young cutoff age
6

of 55 because, particularly in a young, rapidly growing population such as that in Cøte
d'Ivoire, there are relatively few old people. In the 1985 Ivorian sample as a whole, there
are 994 individuals aged 55 or over out of 13,271 people in all, or 73% (in 1986,1,046 out
of 12,296, or 8.1%). For Thailand. the urban sector is relatively oversampled, so that when
the appropriate weights are applied, the survey shows fractions 55 and over of 9.9 in 1981;

weights for the 1986 survey are not currenUy available. National Econoiitic and Social
Development Board (1985) gives a lower figure of 7.83% over 55 in 1980. This publication

notes a tendency for Thai survey data to underestimate the numbers of children under the

age of 10 and this may explain some of the discrepancy. The two esliinates for ate
d'Ivoire, which are only one year apart, provide some cross check on reliability, although
remember that half of the households are common to both surveys.
In rural areas of both counfries, the age distributions of older men are very similar,

with around. 10% of men older than 54 in both cases. The .lvorian survey shows
(absolutely) more men than women in all the age categories over 54, whereas Thailand
shows the common pattern of more women than men, see Figures lb. Id, 2b, 2d, 3b and
3d. In Thailand, the proportions of elderly are increasing over time (except for males in

Bangkok), as is to be expected given the continuing decline in fertility. The major
difference between the two halves of the Table lies in the relAtive youth of the urban
sector in Cote d'Ivoire. Only 4% of the urban population is aged 55 or over, as opposed
to 10% in Thailand, and the much higher level of urbanization in ate d'Ivoire (42%
opposed to 27%) is what reconciles the similarity between the rural sectors with the
overall lower fraction of elderly in Cãte d'Ivoire. Of course, both fractions are still much
lower than those for the more developed countries of the world; in the U.S.. 21.3% of the

population is aged 55 or over in 1985, United Nations (1985), while for developed
countries as a whole there were 15.8% of the population 60 years or over in 1985.
The urbanization figures are given in Table 2 for the elderly and for the population
as a whole. In COte d'lvoire, the urban population grew by 8.7% per annum from 1965-80,

as opposed to 4.2% for the total population, World Bank (1988). and we see the picture

that would be expected If it is largely the younger people who move to the dtia; most
(three-quarters oO old people live in the countryside, as opposed to only sixty percent of
the population as a whole. The towns are predominantly young; there are relatively few

old people in ate d'lvoire in any case, and a relatively small proportion are urbanized.
For Thailand, the picture Is different; the distribution of elderly acoss rural and urban
7

regions is virtually Identical to the distribution of all people aaoss regions. For example,

in 1981, 17.5% of people older than 54 were urbanized, as opposed to 17.8% for the
population as a whole. However, these numbers mask the fact that that the fraction of
older people urbanized exceeds the fraction of children urbanized (14.9%), and is less than
the fraction of people aged 15-54 who are urbanized (20.9%). Thus, cities in Thailand have

a slightly heavier concentration of younger adults than older adults. The difference between the fraction of older and younger adults who are urbanized is so small because there

is relatively slow growth of urban areas in Thailand, and because there are fairly high
rates of migration by the elderly to urban areas other than Bangkok. The growth of the
urban population in Thailand averages 4.6% a year bewteen 1965 and 1980, as opposed
to a 2.6% annual growth rate for the population as a whole, World Bank, (1988). MIgrants
to Bangkok tend to be young: only 2.6% of migrants to Bangkok in 1982 were aged 65 or

older, National Statistical Office, (1983). However, migration rates of older people to
urban areas other than Bangkok have been quite high, with rates for those 65 and older
exceeding rates for those aged 30-49, World Bank (1979).

The Ivorian data also provide information on nationality of people sampled. ate
d'Ivoire has been one of the more successful West African economies, and has attracted

many migrants from its nghbors, particularly Burkina Faso, Mali, and Guinea. Of the
two samples, 13.9% in 1985 and 13.1% in 1986 are non-Ivorian, divided in the ratios 4:21:1

among the three countries listed and other Africans. As one might expect if many of these

migrants are young, the proportions among those 55 and over are lower, 7.6% and 6.8%.

1.2 Living amnngements
Tables 3.A and 3.B tabulate marital status for those aged 55 and over. For women,

the modal status at ages 55-59 is manied, and at 70 and over, it is widowed, with the
weight shifting from one category to the other as we move from the younger to the older
women. These patterns are similar in the two counthes. The modal status for men is
manied in all of these elderly age categories. In Cote d'lvoire, where a quarter of men
have more than one wife, 83% of men aged 70 and over have at least one spouse. Of the
543 Then in Table 3.B, 492 are household heads, and for than we have data on numbers
and ages of wives. Of these 449 have one or more wives in the household, 59% have one
wife, 26% have two, 11% have three, and 4% have four or more. The average age of these

8

449 men is 64, that of the first wife 51, the second wile 44, and the third wife 40. It is
difficult to become a widower in Cate d'Ivoire, and even among those aged 70 or more,
there are only 12% In this category, compared with 26% in rural Thailand.
For Ivorian men, there is a strong association between wealth, especially cash
wealth, age, and the number of wive& Eiecht (1982) describes how, in the•1920's, which

were the early years of cocoa and coffee production in COte d'Ivoire, the cash from the
new crops, which were fanned by lineages, not families, was used to provide bridewealth

for the acquisition for the lineage of new wives, and thus ultiniateiy new labor. By the

1980's, the old lineage system had largely broken down and been replaced by one of

small-scale peasant farming, with alienable land and wage labor, but the use of the
surplus to acquire additional wives remains. Indeed, the acquisition of additional young

wives for wealthy Ivorians is a standard way of purchasing old age security. The
occurrence of polygyny rises with age until remarkably late in life, see Ahonzo etal (1984,

Table 5.8). Only ten percent of men aged 25-29 have more than one wife, and the proportion rises with age until it reaches nearly a third for 65-74 year olds. Indeed, 13% of
men aged 70-74 have three or more wiva
The effects of polygyny on living arrangements also appear in Tables 4.A and 4.B.

Over 80% of Ivorian males in the table live in households with at least one spouse, as

compared with only 60% of men aged 70 or more in Thailand. Elderly women, by
contrast, are increasingly widowed, and live with their children or with otherL About half
of these "others" are brothers who take their sisters into the household, the rest are women
living with a head of household who is more distantly related, perhaps a niece or nephew.

Very few of the elderly, either men or women, live alone in COte d'Ivoire; in the 1986
(1985) sample thereare only fl (17) people over 54 who live by themselves. Indeed, there

are very few couples; less than 5% of the elderly live in households with only two
members. Households are large In COte d'Ivoire, averaging 8.1 persons in 1986, and
neither the elderly (nor anyone else) are likely to live in small households; only 1% of the
people in the survey live In households with less than three members.

The situation in Thailand is different, although the caveat about the definition of
the Thai household must be kept in mind. Household size is smaller, with 4.2 and 4.6
persons per household in Bangkok and rural regions in 1981, and 3.6 and 4.5 per Bangkok
and rural household In 198& There are corres ondingly more older people who live alone
or with their spouses. Among elderly women in rural Thailand in 1981, 5.6% to 14% lived

9

alone, and a substantial fraction among the younger elderly lived together with a spouse
but with no other family members. The numbers for 1986 do not reveal an increase in the
tendency to live alone or with a spouse only. In fact, the fraction of rural females living
alone decreased substantially between the two survey periods for all age groups. Older
individuals who do not live alone or with a spouse only almost always live with adult

children. The fraction of older people living with "others onlf is small for all but
Bangkok females. Of women who do live with "others only," the age of the household
head is typically quite low, indicating that these women may live with adult grandchildren. The "Western" view of the elderly living either alone, alone with spouse, or with
their children, Is perhaps closer to the truth in Thailand than it is in CaMe d'Ivoire. The

larger, more complex families in West Africa allow a wide range of possible living
arrangements, especially for the large fraction of widows.

1.3 Education, labor supply, and health status
The data on education are not comparable between the two counthes, but
nevertheless Tables 5.A and 5.B show similar patterns across ages and sexes in both
Thailand and CaMe d'lvoire. By any measure, educational standards are much higher in
1'hailand, and even among rural women, over 90% of the 20-39 age group have had a least

one year of school, whereas only 37% of Ivorian women in the same age group have ever

been to school. But even in Thailand, very few individuals have ever completed
elementary school (seven years of education), and in the rural villages, less than one
percent of men or women over 40 have done so. In CaSte d'Ivoire none of the sample
women aged sixty or over can read a newspaper, or do a simple written calculation, arid
only a negligible fraction of women over 50 have ever been to school. But apart from the

differences in levels, the patterns are the same; men have more education than women,

and young people have much more education than their elders. Conventional concerns
about education separating the generations are clearly relevant in these sorts of situations.
Three quarters of Ivorian males and more than a half of lvorian females between 15 and
19 can read a newspaper, something that be accomplished by about half of their fathers,

and perhaps a quarter of their mothers, and almost none of their grandparents. One
might legitimately wonder if the experience and wisdom of older farmers, real though it

is, may not be offset by their inability to read the label on a bag of seeds or fertilizer.
Experience may be more valuable than education in a stationary environment, but much
10

growth in LOC's has come from exploiting new aops, and new techniques of growing
them; indeed, there appear to be large gains to greater use of fertilizer and insecticide in
coffee and cocoa production in ate d'Ivoire, gains that have so far gone almost entirely
unexploited, see Deaton and Benjamin (1988).
Labor force participation and hours worked show the standard life- cycle patterns

in both countries. In rural areas in Thailand, almost all prime-age males and females
participate in (mostly agricultural) work, though substantial fractions of time are spent idle
according to the dictates of the agricultural calendar. Participation rates are lower for

women than for men in Bangkok, and fall off very rapidly among the elderly. Among
those who continue to work, hours and weeks remain high. This contrasts with behavior
in the rural sector, where hours and weeks decline along with participation among the
elderly, perhaps because of the physical demands of agricultural work.
Participation rates in ate d'Ivoire are surprisingly low, especially among males

in the 20-39 age group. Note that these figures, although covnmn a broad range of
activities, relate to the last seven days, so that those farmers who did nothing in the past

week would be counted as non-participants. Furthermore, the traditional allocation of
tasks among many West African groups is for women to undertake food growing and
trading activities, leaving men free for hunting, fishing, and fighting. Cocoa and coffee
farming are, however, legitimate activities for men, and are undertaken by a large fraction

of Ivorian households. Participation rates among older workers remain relatively high

into the their late sixties, only falling off among the oldest group. Among older
participants, weeks worked declines hardly atall, although both days and hours per day
fall with age, which is exactly the pattern that might be expected in a predominantly agri-

cultural economy. Note that the hours, days, and weeks figures for ate d'lvoire relate
only to the activity defined as the main job over the last seven days. Many Individuals
have second jobs, and there are a large number of small family enterprises, many run by
women.
Table 7 presents information on the health of the respondents in the Ivorian
survey. These are self-reported figures. and the investigators have no means of checking
the reliability of these reports. Although all respondents were weighed and measured,
such measurements are of relatively little value in detennining health status, except for
children. Except for those under 30, more than a quarter of all respondents in each age
group report some sickness or injury in the last four weeks, with the fraction rising to well

l1

over a half among the older groups. For those aged 55 or over, 6 to 13 days a month are
days of illness, and these illnesses are sufficiently severe to cause a suspension of normal

activities in 3 to todays. Women show more Illness than men until about 40 years of age,
but subsequently show less, considerably less in some of the older age groups. Somewhat
less than a half of all illnesses lead to a medical consultation, or the purchase of medicine,

and the figures suggest that, among the elderly, a smaller fraction of illnesses in females

are severe, or are treated as such. Comparable data from the Thai survey are not
available.

IA Levels of living
Although much of the concern about the elderly is a concern about living
standards, it is remarkably difficult to measure their consumption or income levels, even

in more developed countries, and the difficulties are much greater in poor countries. In
the US, where many old people live alone or with their spouses, their household income
and expenditure levels can give some idea of living standards in relation to the rest of the

population. Indeed, work on the status

the low-income elderlS' in more developed

countries, e.g. Coder, Smeeding, and Torrey (1990). effectively define the population of

interest to be this group, typically female, one-person families and married couples,
groups that together covered 91% of the U.S. population aged 65 and over in 1982, see
CowgiU (1986, p.19).
In Thailand, and even more so in COte d'Ivoire, the vast majority of the elderly live

with other people, children, spouses, and other relations, and very few live alone.
Household surveys collect data on household levels of living, not on those of the
individuals within them. Disentangling who gets what within the household is difficult,

even for 'privat& goods like food, and attempts to do so require costly and intrusive
techniques of observation. For public goods, such as housing, entertainment, and many
services, individual consumption levels are not even well defined. In contrast to

consumption, many income flows can be assigned to individual members of the
household, although only with great difficulty in farm households, although such
assignment, even when possible, tells us only a limited amount about the distribution of
welfare within the household, which is our main concern. There is a belief in much of the
development literature that individuals who bring money into the household receive better

12

treabnent than those who do not, but there is little aedible evidence to support the

contention.

This problems of Isolating the living standards of the elderly Is conceptually the
same as that of isolating the living standards of children, a topic on which there exists a

large and venerable literature. However, as argued In Pollak and Wales (1979) and
elaborated in Deaton and Muellbauer (1986), much of this literature sets out by assuming
what it wants to measure, and, even after more than a century of research, no generally
acceptable methodology has been derived that would support the Isolation of children's
living standards from household level data. One possible avenue, suggested in Deaton,
Thomas, and Ruiz-CastiII 0989), Is to identify a set of goods that are not consumed by

adults, for example children's goods, and, on the grounds that additional adults exert
negative income effects, but no substitution effects on such goods, measure the "cost" of
old people versus that of younger adults by calculating their relative (negative) effects on
the consumption of child goods. However, it is difficult to Isolate commodities that are

only consumed by children, especially in less developed countries where children consume

little beyond food, shelter, and clothing. Moreover, (unreported) experiments with the

Spanish data used in Deaton, Thomas, and Ruiz-Castillo, did not lead to sensible
estimates.

if these problems of measuring living standards are taken seriously, it is unclear
that it possible for most LDC's to make statements about, for example, the fraction of old

people living In poverty; let alone to address broad topic like the effect of development
on the status of the old. Even so, something can be said, and we report some fragmentary
but relevant evidence.

The simplest procedure Is to assume that everyone in each household Is treated

equally, and to impute to each person the per capita or pa adult equivalent total
expenditure or Income for the household In which they reside. If the assumption is
correct, the procedure yields the right answer. If it Is false, as it almost certainly Is, then
the calculations are still infonnative. If old people live predominantly in households with
low avenge living standards, we are more likely to be concerned about their welfare than

would otherwise be the case. Of course, it may be that it is the children or younger
people in such households that we should worry about, not their likely powerful elders.
Table S shows the relevant calculations for Cote d'lvolre in 1986. In computing
adult equivalents, children under 5 have been assigned a weight of 0.25, and those from
13

5 to 14, a weight of 0.45. These numbers

are essentially arbitrary, but they are relatively

low in the light of the considerations discussed in Deaton and Muellbauer (1986), and it

is better to make some such assumptions than to work with either total or per capita
household expenditure. As the age of the individual inaeases, the average number of
household members with which he or she resides deaeases, from 12 at age 0 to 9 at age

but rises to around 10 for the oldest ages. The economic measures, Income,
consumption, and income and consumption per equivalent all have the same general
70,

shape, rising to their maxima for the 30-34 year age group and falling steadily thereafter.
Among the oldest people, household total income and expenditures in the households in

whichtheylivearelittlemorethnahllthelevelsinthepeakyears,andtheper
equivalent measures are less than a half of the peaks If consumption per equivalent is
taken as a representative measure, the average for those 55 and over is 79% of the average
for all individuals.
Older Ivorians live in households that have less income and consumption than the
national average. However, old people live mostlyin rural areas, and the much better-off
urban residents are typically young. Moreover, the rural-urban difference is likely
overstated by the fact that no allowance is made for price differences between rural and

urban areas, and because urban residents typically pay rent, or have rents imputed for
them, something that cannot be done for rural residents. Table 9 repeats the information
for rural areas only. Now the relationship between living standards and age has
essentially disappeared; while total consumption and income fall with age, at least until
the late sixties, adult equivalents fall at much the same rate, so that there is little or no

relationship between age and the per equivalent measures.
Tables 10 and 11 show income and expenditure by the age of the individual for
Bangkok and rural areas in 1981. Unlike Cote d'lvoire, the number of adult equivalents
per household does not vary with age. However, family income and expenditure do not
vary greatly with age either. There is a small peak in income in the 50-54 age range for
males in both Bangkok and rural regions; in Bangkok, this peak in income is offset by a

corresponding peak in the number of adult equivalents. Overall, income and expenditure,
as well as income and expenditure per adult equivalent, are very flat acoss age groups.
The average consumption per adult equivalent of those 55 and over is 100.3% of the
average for all individuals in Bangkok, and 109% for rural regions. On average, older
Thais in both Bangkok and rural regions do not live in poorer households.
14

Unlike the lvorian surveys, the Thai surveys provide a good deal of information
on individual income levels and the sources of individual income. If the allocation of
consumption to members within a household depends on the amount of income members

bring to the household (and again, it is not known if this is true), then the patterns of
individual income with age provide evidence on standards of living over the life-cycie.
Information on the distribution of income between pensions, annuities, and
property
income, as opposed to remittances and gifts, provides evidence on the extent to which
older individuals rely on asset markets for old-age support.

It is possible to disaggregate individual income into that derived from wages.
fanning and self-employment (called business income), property, transfers (remittances,
pensions and annuities), and other sources. The measures of profits from farming and
self-employment are problematic in that they do not exclude the value of free family labor

used, and are usually "assigned" to the household head "or to the operator of the
enterprise if he could be identifiet" For most family businesses, it is not clear that the
profits from the business should be assigned to any one person. In what follows, no
adjus&nents were made for these problems.
Table 12 provides infonnation on individual income and the distribution of income
for males and females in Bangkok and rural regions. Unlike the household incomefigures

discussed above; there is a clear pattern of individual income over the life-cycle. For both

rural and Bangkok males, income levels peak in the 50-59 age range and then decline
rapidly. Female income levels in are flatter over the 30-60 age range but then also decline.

These results are consistent with the declines in labor force participation for both males

and females after the age of 60, and much of the declining income levels of older
individuals can be accounted for by the increasing fraction of those who earn no income
at all.

As Is to be expected, the share of income from wages and business declines for

older people, although the share of income from farming and self-employment remains
quite high for men (49% and 79% for Bangkok and rural men aged 60-69). This reflects

the fad that the oldest man in the household is usually the head of the household and
would typically have all family business income assigned to hint.
The share of income derived from transfers (including pensions, annuities, and
remittances) inaeases dramatically with age for both men and women in Bangkok and
rural regions. Transfers account for a large share of individual income, particularly for

is

women. These transfers consist mainly of remittances, presumably from family members

or friends in other houseboldL Although transfers cannot be divided up between
remittances and pensions and annuities at the individual level, they can be disaggregated
at the household level. Of all households that receive transfers, 93% of those in Bangkok

receive no pensions or annuities, and 97% of rural households receive no pensions or
annuities. The share of income from property (including interest, dividends, and rents)
inaeases with age but, like pensions and annuities, is quite small, reaching only 10-12%
of income for both Bangkok and rural residents in the 70+ age group. Thus, sources of

old-age income that are standard in developed countries have only a very small role in
Thailand.
Table 13 tabulates income by source for rural males and females who live alone

or with a spouse only, and for those who live with at least one person who is not a
spouse. Older people living with others are less likely to earn any income at all.
However, the shares of income from different sources are not too dissimilar for those in

different living ai+angements. The fraction of total family income derived from goods
received free does vary with living arrangements. For example, for rural females aged 6069, goods

received free accounts for 18% of family income for those alone or with a spouse

only, and only 5% of family income for those living with others. For females living alone

dr with a spouse only, free goods and transfers make up a significant share of their
income.

I Househoidlile-cycles
In this section we move our focus away from individuals and towards households,

and how they change with the ages of their members. Households in LDC's are typically

larger than those in more developed countries, particularly so here for COte d'lvoire, so
that, with several generations living together, the life-cycle patterns of the household as
an aggregate may be much attenuated compared with the patterns observed in the West.

Households with between ten and twenty members are not uncommon in Cow d'Ivoire,

and in the limit, it is possible to imagine a state of affairs in which each household's
demographic composition is a miniature version of that of the country as a whole, and the

life-cycles of the individuals within the household offset are subswned into a stationary
structure for the household.

16

In fact, such is far from being the case in ate d'Ivoire. Table 14.B shows the
breakdown of household heads by age and sex. If household composition were stationaiy,

and the oldest male was always designated as the household head, there would be no
heath outside this category. In reality, 42% of household heads are under the age of 55,
and only 19% are men over the age of 70. Only five percent of households contain one

or more married sons of the head, and less than one percent have two or more. Similarly,

it is rare for married brothers to live together; only three percent of male headed
households contain a married brother. These households seem to conform wefl to what
Cowgill (1986. p.62) describes as the common pattem among polygynous households; 'a

man, his several wives, their (unmarried) children? and possibly "some additional
consanguines, such as unmarried or widowed sisters of the husband, and perhaps his
aged parents." New households are set up by married sons, so that, while there is a clear
bias towards older heads and there are more heads in older groups than their share of the

population would warrant, there are many households headed by younger men.
The economic status of the household is also dearly related to the age of its head,

as shown In Table 15. These data are presented for both years; they are probably a good

deal less reliable, particularly for assets, than previous data, so that one year cannot be
safely taken as representative for both. The figures show that older heads preside over
bigger households, but that both household income and household total expenditure reach

a peak among households headed by 30-34 year.olds. and then steadily decline. The
pattern, if It Is there, is a good deal less obvious in the rural areas. As was the case for

patterns in the individual data, the hump in household incomes and expenditures Is
exaggerated by pooling older, poorer, rural individuals with younger, richer, urban ones.

Since household size and the number of equivalents increase with the age of the head,

deflation by either measure produces a pattern in which household living standards
decline with the age of the head, so that the hump is moved to the extreme left of the age

distribution.
The hump-shaped pattern, in which incomes and consumption shapes are closely
matched, is one with a peak that occurs much earlier in the head's age distribution than
is the case in many LDC's, particularly those in Asia, see Deaton (1990) for evidence on
Thailand. Korea, Indonesia, and Hong Kong, the first of which we return to below. These

cross-country patterns are important because, as pointed out by Carroll and Summers
(1989). if tastes are common across countries, then the rapidly growing countries are those
17

where young people are relatively much richer than their parents and grandparents, so
that age consumption profiles should peak earliest in the most rapidly growing economies.

But ate d'lvoire is a very slow-growing economy relative to Thailand and the other
Asian counfries listed above, and this slow growth is accompanied by the earliest peak In

household consumption. As Carroll and Summers emphasize, these results make it
difficult to believe that life-cycle saving Is responsible (or the cross-country correlation
between growth and savings that edsts in the data. Instead, the obvious alternative is that

consumption tracks income over the life-cycle, a hypothesis that is fully consistent with
the data in Table 15.
Saving itself is as often negative as positive, arid shows no clear pattern with age.

The measurement of Income for poor. largely illiterate, self-employed farmers in LDC's

is an undertaking fraught with difficulty, and little weight should be attached to the
magnitude of these figures. However, analysis of the micro data from COte d'lvoire
provides evidence that farmers undertake short-nan saving to smooth their consumption
relative to their noisy incomes, and this evidence is also consistent with the earlier results
on farmers' saving behavior in Thailand In Paxson (1989).
The asset figures are likely to be al ost as unreliable as the savings data, and there

is a still unresolved question as to why the (largely self reported) figures (or agricultural
assets are so much lower in 1956 than in 1955. The data in the upper panels suggest that,

over the country as a whole, asset levels continue to increase with -the age of the
household head, but some of this is an aggregation effect; in the rural panel, agricultural
assets are more or less equally distributed across age groups, something that would follow

from a process in which land is closely tied to household formation. Note that, at least
until recent years, land has not been particularly scarce in Cote d'lvoire (nor in Thailand),

and, given permission from the lineage owning the land, new cocoa and coffee farms
could be established by clearing virgin forest, with ownership gradually established by
use. Even today, fathers would typically assume responsibility for providing their sons
with land, and If uncultivated land is no longer available within the lineage boundaries,

the acquisition or use of land elsewhere will be arranged, preferably close by, but
sometimes at some considerable distance. See again Hecht (1982) for a description of the

evolution of land markets in response to increasing scardhes, first of labor, and later of
land.

18

Table 16 presents regressions of income, consumption, and the asset variables on
household demographic structure, and on dummies for the five main urbanization and

agrodlirnatic zones in the country. These results should not be interpreted as structural

equations, but as an alternative and more informative description of the relationship
between head's age and these economic variables. High income and consumption levels

are associated with the presence of prime age males and females; in itself evidence of
consumption tracking income. The presence or absence of individuals aged 55 and over

seems to contribute little to household income or consumption levels. Asset levels,
however, are positively associated with the presence of older men, (but not older women)

particularly those aged from 55 to 64. This is certainly consistent with a steady
accumulation of assets by the male head, passing on to sons at or before death. Women
aged 25-34 also attract a very large positive coefficient in the agricultural assets equation.

Since daughters would not normally inherit land, there is no obvious explanation for this
result, although it could conceivably reflect the propensity of older wealthy men to marry

young second or fluid wivet There is no evidence of an association between business
assets and women, although many small business in ate d'lvoire are owned by women.
Thai households (as defined by the Socioeconomic Surveys) are much smaller than

those in Cote d'lvoire. Using 1981 data, approximately 50% of rural households have four

members or less, and households of ten or more members are rare. Households in
Thailand are also likely to have younger household heads. Sixty-three percent of rural
household heads and 69% of urban household heads are younger than 55, see Table 14.A.

The size of households also varies with the age of the household head. The first column

of Table 17 shows that the number of household members first inaeases and then
decreases as the household head ages. These numbers are consistent with the "Western'
pattern of children marrying and setting up their own households, which grow as children

are added, and then shrink as children move out. Cowgill (1986, pp.69-70) describes the
Thai system as a "residual stem family" system, in which young married couples often live

with one set of parents but only until a younger sibling marries and takes their place. The
last child married, often the last daughter married, stays with the parents until the parents
die, and then inherits the land. This would explain why households with very old house-

hold heads have, on average, four members rather than one or two.
These patterns of household formation may make life-cycle models of household

consumption more relevant for Thailand than Cote d'lvoire. With smaller households It
19

is less likely that household members span a broad range of ages, and the age of the
household head should be a good Indicator of where a household is in Its life-cycle. Given

the fairly rapid growth in Thailand, one might expect to see younger (richer) households

both eaniing and consuming more than older households.
The results in Table 17 indicate that income and consumption do follow a hump-

shaped pattern similar to that seen in COte d'lvoire but with a much later peak in both
income and consumption. Household income reaches its highest level in the 60-64 age
category for Bangkok. and in the 50-54 age category for rural areas. Consumption tracks

income closely, and saving also appears to follow a similar pattern, with those in the
highest income groups saving most, although the pattern for saving is less pronounced.
These patterns are consistent with the age patts of individual Income shown in Table

12, and are also consistent with the patterns of household size shown in Table 17.
Household heads in their 40's and 5(Ys have the largest households, and it is likely that
the children in these households are old enough to contribute substantially to household
income.

Although total household income and consumption are both strongly related to

the age of the head of the household, income and consumption after adjusting for the

number of adult equivalents are not. Since family size and the number of adult
equivalents follows the same hump-shaped pattern as income and consumption, adjustment for family size results in extremely flat income and consumption profiles that appear
to have no relation to the age of the household head.

The absence of any difference in income and consumption per equivalent adult
between young and old households is puzzling, especially in a rapidly growing country
such as Thailand. One possible explanation is that households in Thailand may be much

more complex than the data suggest. As discussed earlier, a small "household" may
actually be part of a larger group of several related households in a single compound, and

there may be significant transfers between such households. The fact that older people
"living alone" receive a large fraction of their incomes in the form of free goods (most of
which are food) suggests this might be so. If each household, as measured by the survey

data, is actually part of a network of closely linked households containing people in

different generations, then it becomes quite unclear whether one ought to expect
individual households to operate in ways predicted by life-cycle models. One can imagine

a situation in which household formation is itself the mechanism that is used to smooth
20

consumption (and income) across individuals in different generations: inthviduaLs may be

'allocated' across households so as to maintain roughly equal consumption levels across
all family members within a group of households. Much more detailed data on links
between households would have to be collected to determine whether or not this is so.

& Conclusions
We have presented a considerable mass of evidence, most of it not well structured
by any theoretical concerns. This is perhaps inevitable given the current state of the
subject; aging in developing countries is an issue that looks like it might be important, but
concern is still unfocussed on any particular set of economic research questions, or even
outstanding policy issues. There are many large and attractively wooly creatures at loose
in the forest the role of development and the status of the aged, the relationship between

marriage patterns, polygamy, living arrangements, and the treatment of the elderly, and

what policy steps, if any, should be considered by those Asian countries that are facing

rapidly rising shares of elderly inhabitants. But we are very far, not only from answers,
but even from a well-defined set of topics that economists could usefully think about.
Even so, we feel that we have learned something by looking at these data and by

writing this paper, and it is perhaps useful to conclude by sununarizing some of what Is

known, and what might usefully be learned:
i: Questions of the economic status of the old in LDC's are not answerable and

have to be rethought. In more developed countries, where perhaps nine tenths of the
elderly live by themselves or with elderly spouses, household surveys can tell us a great
deal about their living standards. In LDC's, to a greater or lesser degree, older people do

not live by themselves, and until a method can be found for measuring intrahousehold
allocations, we have no method of assigning welfare levels to than, or indeed to other
members of the households in which they live.
2. More work needs to be done on the question of whether the source of income,

i.e. who earns it, affects what individual members of the household receive. This cannot

be done directly, but if the earnings of the elderly are spent differently from other
household income, the fact should be detectable from consumption data Data such as
those from Thailand show considerable variation in source of Income with age, although

the patterns are quite different from those in the Unites States or Western Europe.

21

3. In the U.S. and other developed countries, where many elderly people live
alone, there has been concern about thepossible abandonment of the old. However, such

cases seem to be rare, most old people live alone because they want to do so, and
frequency of contact with children is generally high, see Mancini and Blieszner (1989) for

a review. In ate d'Ivoire, under current living conditions, abandonment would seem to

be an unlikely event, because very few old people live alone. There are perhaps more
grounds for concern in Thailand, but the population at risk is still small, and is probably
overstated by the survey results quoted here. However, there is evidence from elsewhere

that suggests that these results should not be generalized to all poor countries. In many

areas of India, living arrangements for newly-weds are strictly patrilocal, so that, alter
marriage, women are effectively cut off from their parents' family. In turn, they will be
looked after in old age by their sons, their daughters having themselves moved to their
husbands families. In consequence, women who fail to produce sons, or fail to produce

surviving Sons, are likely to fall into destitution as widows. Drèze (1988) provides
evidence on this problem, and highlights it as an outstanding issue for social security and
poverty policy in India.
4. The living rrangenents of the elderly will vary from place to place according

to marriage arrangements, agroclimatic conditions, and the availability of labor and land.
The position of Indian widows has already been cited. In Cote d'Ivoire, living patterns

have been changing in response to the increasing scarcity of land, since sons, who
previously were guaranteed land nearby, now are often required to set up households at
considerable distances. The shortage of land itself reflects a great deal of immigration to
the cocoa and coffee areas, an immigration that responded to original laborshortage, and

that contnbuted to the destruction of the original lineage system of cocoa and coffee
production. One may also wonder whether the pattern of inheritance in Northern
Thailand, whereby as a result of the residual stem family system, the youngest daughter
typically inherits the land, will continue unmodified into ann where land is increasingly

scan
5. Individual participation and earnings patterns show the standard life-cycle
hump shapes in COte d'lvoire and Thailand. and presumably do so more wiØeiy.
However, households act so as to make average living standards within households much

less variable over the life-cycle than are the individual patterns. The degree to which this

happens in the data is different between the two countries, and depends on how house22

hold size is measured. Even so, sharing resources between household members is presumably one of the main economic functions of the household. What needs a great deal

more research is the extent to which household size and composition ibeif adapts to
facilitate sharing, and to guarantee the best possible living standards to its members. In
both Thailand and CAte d'lvoire, there is a great deal of migration, on both a seasonal and

non-seasonal basis. In Thailand, the process of household formation is explicitly tied to

the pressure on resources within the compound, so that the departure of a previously
married child on the marriage of a youngEr sibling is as much a matter of economics as

of immutable custom. In the panel households in COte d'lvoire, there are major
differences in membership between 1985 and 1986, and while there is undoubtedly some
measurement error, careful attempts were made to link household members from one year

to the next, and there Is certainly a great deal of movement. Fosterage of children, often

children not closely related, is a widespread phenomenon in West Africa, see Ainsworth
(1989). and provides a mechanism, not only for education, training and apprenticeship,

but also for sharing economic burdens between members of the same lineage. There has

a good deal of emphasis on the role of risk sharing in determining patterns of
marriage and migration, see for example. Rosenzweig (1989). But there is scope for more
modeling here, particularly for a simple unifying theory that explains how potential
household members decide how to form household groups given the economic
been

opportunities available to them.
6. There are a number of interactions between urbanization and age distributions.

Migration tends to lead to young cities and an older countryside, as is the case in COte
d'Ivoire, but much urban growth in LDC's comes from reproductive behavior, as well as
from migration. The fall in fertility in the demographic transition often begins first in the

cities, so that cities are likely to age more rapidly than more rural areas. The balances
between these forces will produce different age distributions in different countries, for
example, younger cities in Africa, and older cities in Asia, and these have a number of
repercussions for policy, for example in the provision of services, as well as in the likely
effectiveness of older people as a political force.

7. Many LDC's are in a state of transition, not only demographic but also
educational. In both countries examined here, there are very large differences between the
educational attainments of the different generations. The consequencesof these differences

are much less clear, and we do not wish to subsaibe to the view that they always and
23

everywhere undermine the status of the old. Nevertheless, models that provide a theoretical framework for the role of the elderly would do well to bear these facts In mind.
8. The life-cycle model of saving and capital accumulation, which has brought so

many insights in developed countries, cannot be applied without modification to
economies where the functions of households are different. Asset accumulation for old
age, with a large share of the capital stock being accounted for (or not accounted for) by
life-cycle saving, is not likely to be a very useful model for savings in LDCs. Households

can and do provide old-age insurance without an obvious need to accumulate and
decumulate assets. Our data do not suggest any run down of assets with the age of the
household head. Of course, as in more developed economies, heads have a range of other
motives for keeping control of assets for as long as possible.
9. As In developed countries, there is a pronounced household life-cycle, with a
hump shaped income, peaking much earlier in CaMe d'lvoire than in Thailand. However,

we doubt that there is much long-term consumption smoothing associated with these

humps, and tend to attach more importance to saving as a means of smoothing consumption over short-term fluctuations in income that are typically associated with
agricultural activities. Indeed, it is possible that variations in household structure
contribute more to long-term smoothing than do variations in assets.

Figures are percentages of the relevant -group, so that, in Thailand in
1981. 3.2% of all women in Bangkok were aged 55—59. OBS is the total number of
observations forall ages in the sample, so that, e.g., there are 3144 females
in the urban Ivorian sample in 1985. Note that the Ivorian sample is a simple
random sample, so that the sasmple numbers can be used toestimate the fraction
urbanised.
This is not true for the Thai survey, see Table 2 below. The Thai
results exclude urban non—Bankok and the suburban sanitary districts" sector.

Note: Spouse means living alone with spouse and no others, kids with children and no
others, and so on. Children are defined as biological children of the reference
elderly person, living in the same household, so that a woman living with her spouse
and the spouse's children who are not her own would be classed under "spouse and
others, - which Is different from the treatment in Thailand.
