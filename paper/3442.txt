I. INTRODUCTION

Our purpoae in thia paper ia to explain the conatruction of a aet of price indexes relating to international trade in manufactured goods. The indexes
are intended

to

be free

of some of the defects of existing measures and more

suitable for the calculation of changes in quantities traded and for the
analysis of the relations between prices and quantities.
Measures of the prices of manufactured goods are a weak link in empirical
studies of international trade. While most authors have accepted the existing
indexes for primary products

a few have been skeptical

as reasonably accurate and representative,

quite

about the data for manufactured goods prices. Their

deficiencies affect studies of competitiveness,

of real exchange rates, of

income elasticities of demand, of price and substitution elasticities,

of the

terms of trade, and of the supply of exports.

*We are indebted

to Catherine Mann and 3. David Richardson for many valuable

comments and suggestions, and to Ossan Sari, assisted by Nisangul Ceran and
Zhang Zhu, for price collection and statistical

work on the recent data and to

Jases Hayes and Rosa SchUpbach for the preparation of the manuscript. An
earlier version of the paper was presented at the Conference on Internmtional
Economic Transactions of the NBER Conference on Research in Income and Wealth,

The list of defects is e long one. For many

of their accuracy, particularly for sanufactured
goods.1 Not only are the unit

index nusber formulas.
In the case of primary goods, quality
changes were thought to be relatively small, end where they were not, prices based on narrow
specifications
were often available as a check on the data based on unit values.
The introduction of new products was not thought to be a
major problem. While there
have been ssny large shifts in sources of
supply for primery products, moat
scholars have been willing to accept that, for these
goods at least, the law
of one price worked well enough that a
missing price observation could be
safely filled in using the price of the same product from another
country.
None of these reassurances can be applied to the
prices of manufactured
goods. It is possible that there is serious
underrepresentationof new commodities, at least for part of their history. There have been suggestions that
price indexes for manufactured goods suffered from upward bias due to the
neglect of quality chartyc. Export prices for automobiles, for example,

These are collected with a much higher degree of quality

than is applied to the unit value indexes,

at least in some countries.

However, the prices do not purport to spply to externsl

trade.

The difference

in movmsent between domestic and export prices can be significant,
pointed out in the sources mentioned

as is

above and in Kalter (1978), Krsvis and

Lipsey (1977a and 1977b), where these differences are interpreted as

reflecting changes in export profit margins, Baldwin (1988),
Krugman (1987), Mann (1986), Msrston (1989), and Ohno (1989).2 The producer

price indexes share the characteristicof the unit value indexes that they
computed with different weighting, coverage,

and index number formulas

in dif-

ferent countries. For both types of indexes, the fact thst the methods of coa—
putstion differ greatly from one country to another stems from the fact that
for
they are computed by national statistical agencies for their own purposes,
which they may be quite satisfactory.

A further consequence of the dependence on price collection by individual
countries is that it builds in an assumption about price behavior.

The

collection
assumption is that prices of goods not covered by a country's price
in the saae
process move identically with prices of covered commodities

the prices of
general class or, if the whole class is uncovered, with
commodities in general.

It is implicitly assumed that price movements of the

same product in other countries convey no information at all about the likely
change in the missing prices.

That is en odd choice of assumptions for a

—4—
profession that often assumes the operation of purchasing power parity or the
"law of one price." The practical

a comparison between a country

implication

can be imagined in the case of

that covers computer

prices in its price index

and a country that omits them and assumes they follow
prices of other products.
In this paper,

we construct s set of international

price indexes for manu-

factured goods for 1953 to 1988, that addresses these issues in several
ways.
t.

Weighting. We construct two types of indexes of manufactured goods prices.
One is intended mainly for studies of competition in international

trade.

It is calculated for the United States and for the
aggregate of many of
its eajor competitors, using the export weights of the United States and

weighting at e fine level of commodity detail such as the 4—digit SITC.

A

similar calculation is performed for Germany end its competitors, using
German export weights, and for Japan and its competitors, using
Japanese
export weights.

Index of domestic prices with own-country export weights

are also calculated for each of the three countries to examine the
possibility of divergences between export and domestic price movements
and their implications for changing margins of profitability of export
and domestic seles.
A second type of index, used, for example,

in studying world trends in

terms of trade, is a "world" index of manufactured goods
prices, using as
weights aggregate OECD exports or developed country exports to developing
countries: We also conatruct indexes for individual

countries based on

these two sets of weights.
For all of these types of indexes, we carry out the calculations using
weights from a relatively early date, 1963, and from a later date, 1975.

Missing prices.

In place of the assumption that prices for products not

covered move in the same way as those covered in the same country,
in the aggregate indexes for all developed

countries,

we use,

a method that incor-

porates both country and commodity effects in estimating missing prices.
The method is an adaptation of one developed by Summers (1973) for the estiIt involves fitting an equation to each

mation of country price levels.

The block is defined by the full list of commodities and countries in, say,
a two—digit SITC class.

for example, a dummy variable for

the use of a hedonic price index or a variable to represent the movement of
the price in the preceding year.
3.

Quality corrections. One reason for doubts as to the accuracy of price
indexes for manufactured products is the suspicion that they do not take
biased
adequate account of changes in the quality of these goods and are
Upward on that account.

There have been no studies that examine changes in

studies of
quality specific to exports and imports but a fair number of
the
quality change, and of the correction of prices for quality change, by
use of hedonic price measures.

We show the effect on the U.S. export price

indexes of introducing the quality—adjustedprice measures that have been
calculated for a few commodities in the United States. We then also show
the effect on world price indexes of introducing these quality adjustments,

under several

possible assumptions about the relation between

quality change in the U.S. and quality change in other countries.

METHODS AND SOURCES

Sources of Detailed Price Data
The indexes are based on disaggregated export price data for countries for
which they are available, with gaps filled by
producers and wholesale price
indexes and hedonic price indexes, where possible.
There are several basic ingredients for our indexes. The first are the
international price indexes for setals, metal products,

machinery,

and

transport equipment, for the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany,
Japan,

and

covering 1953—1964 from Krsvis and Lipsey (1971), with interpolations

based on the other types of data, as explained for the came of Germany in
Kravis and Lipmey (1972). The second are the official
produced by the U.S., Germany,

export price indexes

and Japan, the latter two fairly comprehen-

sive, the first starting with the same coverage am the Kravis-Lipmey indexes

and gradually increasing in coverage over time until they are now quite
complete.

The third element of our indexes is more fragmentary export price

the last gradually

increasing in scope over the years. The fourth type of data is producer price

published indexes exist. The second is as a substitute for

conventional price series in a very rough attempt at adjustment for quality
change, where we consider it appropriate and important.
The various sources of data, of course, overlap extensively in commodity
coverage.

than the conventional series, we have not given them priority

because we wished to produce indexes from something close to conventional
data.

However,

we have also calculated an alternative index in which hedonic

price series are given priority,

and we consider that to be the beat estimate

we can make of the movement of prices of manufactured goods.

end producer or

wholesale prices the second, but no hedonic price indexes are used because
the hedonic price data are confined to the U.S.

The results would depend too

heavily on whether hedonic indexes were applied only to the U.S. or are
assumed to reflect similar changes in quality in other countries' exports.
The domestic price indexes based on export weights use no export prices
and are based entirely on producer or wholesale prices.

The precise sources of the price data are given in Appendix A.
Weighting Schemes and Missing Price Observations
As was suggested in an earlier paper (Kravim and Lipaey, 1984), the
selection of systems of weighting is second only to the selection of basic
price data in determining the characteristics of the resulting price indexes.

—8—
Several different methods have been used, implying different assumptions not
only sbout the importance to be given to commodities but also, ususlly inadvertently, sbout the behavior of prices for which dsta sre unsvailable.

We can think of a set

of worldwide weights representing the values of

exports of each commodity (defined here as a four—digit SITC subgroup) from
each country (ij)'

to be

used in weighting price reistives showing changes

over time in individusl prices
(Pd).
If we think of the weights in the form of a country by commodity matrix,
we have:

weights representing the importance of each country in world trade. The importance of each country might be measured by the value of trade or, in some
csses,

by weights derived from a model. In terms of the mstrix above, these

It is usually uncertain in these calculations, since they do not go

behind published aggregates, what commodities are included with what comand with what base years. It is likely that many of the

modity weights,

country indexes lack proper representationof complex manufactured products.
given all these characteristics, it is not surprising if elasticities of
substitution or price elasticities of demand are found to be low or if no
significant relationships can be found.

in which the same set of coaaodity weights

at the four-digit SITC level was applied to each country's prices.4

The dif-

ferences between one country's aggregate price change and those of rival
countries were then more clearly attributable to differences in price changes
for the same products rather than to some aixture of these with differences in
the coverage or weighting of products.

Both of these types of indexes involve the same assumptions about the
nature of the commodities priced at the most detailed

level and about price

relationships, since each involves filling in missing price observations using
only data for the same country. The justification for starting with the calculation of country indexes is the assumption that missing prices tend to behave
in a similsr manner

to the average of other prices

commodities in the sase 3-digit,

2-digit,

in the same country for

or 1-digit comsodity classes.

These

methods, therefore, ignore the behavior of other countries' prices for the
same commodity, a difficult assumption to accept for anyone who believes price
movements in different countries are correlated at all.

An alternative method of calculating world or other price

indexes aggre-

gated over countries would be

wjjPjj

=

iT

in which a world price index for each commodity would be calculated first,
and all these would then be aggregated across commodities using worldwide
commodity trade weights. This procedure would come closer to acceptance of
the law of one price than those outlined above, since it assumes that one
country's price for a commodity tends to move with the average of other
countries' prices for the same commodity. However,

it therefore

assumes that

there is no country—specific effect on s price change. Thus, e currency revs—
lustion is presumed to have no effect on the export price of the revaluing
country in comparison to that of others, s proposition we have found in our studies of international price behavior to be contradicted frequently.5
A preliminary test of the two extreme assumptions,

reported

in Krmvis end

—

(1984), was to compare the variance of price movements among countriea

at the 1—digit SITC level with the variance among 4-digit commodities within
1-digit commodity divisions within countries, using year-to-year price movements for the U.S., Germany,

and Japan. The variance among countries within

1—digit claaaea waa larger than the variance among 4—digit commodities within
a

claaa within countries. The conclusion there was that "... if either country

alone or commodity alone had to be used aa the criterion for assigning missing
price observations, country would be a better choice." However, considerable
further tests would be needed to make a definitive judgment on this issue.
Estimating Missing Prices by the Country—ProductDummy Method
Despite the range of sources from which we collected price data, it was
not possible to collect prices for every item for every country for every
year. The earlier studies by Kravis

and Lipsey adopted the almost universal

procedure of setting some minimum level of coverage for a group of commodities and, if that level was achieved, using the average price change for
covered commodities am an estimate of that for the whole group, assuming in
effect that the prices of uncovered items move, on average,

identically to

those of covered items. We continue to use this method for the individual
country price indexes based on own—country weights (Appendix C).
Common though this procedure for estimating missing prices is, it discards
some probably pertinent information about the missing category:

the price

change for the corresponding product in other countries. We have therefore
used a different method for the developed country price indexes. This method,
referred to as the country—product dummy (CPD) method, was developed by Robert
Summers (1973) for use in estimating missing price levels for inter—country
price comparisons in the United Nations International Comparison Project

12 —

—

(ICP).

Its

purpose wss to use informstion on both country influences and pro-

duct influences on the price of e product to estimate each missing price. In
its original version, discussed by Sumsers, it involved regressions for com-

modity groups using natural logs of the price levels as the dependent
variable, and country and product dummies as the independent variables. There
was a product dummy variable for every product in the group, end a country
dummy variable for every country but one, which was designated the base
country.

The coefficient of a country dummy term for country

j

in one of these

equations represents the natural log of the ratio of the price level in this
commodity group in country j to the price level in the base country.

If we

tranalate the equation into natural numbers, the price level for country

j

appears as an exponent in the equation.

We wished to estimate not only commodity group price changes but also the
price changes for each missing item.

We created am dense a price matrix as

possible at the 4—digit level as a first step, thereby permitting weighting
and reweighting as our needs changed.

We estimate the missing prices by using

the commodity dummy coefficients in conjunction with the country dummy coefficients.

Because there is no dummy for the base country,

the commodity dummy

coefficients are estimates of the prices for thome commodities in the base
country. To estimate a price missing in the base country's data therefore, we
used the exponent of the appropriate commodity dummy. For any other country,
we multiplied the exponent of the coefficient for the product by that for the
country: we adjusted the "base" price for a commodity for the group price difference between the base country and the dummy country.
In running the regressions, we had two procedural problems to resolve.
The first wam to define the commodity groupm within which we would run

13 —

—

regressions.

A group should be defined narrowly to make it as homogeneoum am

possible while still retaining sufficient degrees of freedom for a regresmion.
The 2-digit SITC categories were the starting

points, but some groups had too

few SITC subdivisions and others had too few available observations.
Therefore, in cases where the regression for a 2-digit group would have had
less than 10 degrees of freedom,
in the same 1—digit division.

we pooled it with other small 2—digit groups

The second problem was that data were so scarce

for certain countries in various years and groups that we felt that the estimates for these countries would be statistically meaningless. Therefore, in
any one regression, we included only countries for which we had price data for
3

or more commodities within the group, as well as those for which even a

smaller number of iteem accounted for 30% of the group weight. The weights for
commodities and groups were based on 1963 OECD exports.

Theme procedures were

applied on a yearly basis, so that while two groups may have been combined

in

an early year because neither one included a sufficient number of observations,

they may have been treated meparately in a later year if the nuaber

of available prices increased. Similarly, a country excluded in one year eight
be included

in another if the coverage of its price data improved.

Aggregation of Detailed Price Indexes
Once we had run regressions for every 2—digit group and year for which it
was feasible,

and the resulting price estimates were used to fill in any holes

at the 4-digit level, the 4—digit price indexes were weighted up to the
3—digit level.

Not every 3—digit group price index could be estimated by

aggregation. If the price index for

a

3-digit group was "missing"

because

there were not enough data at the 4-digit level, the index at the 3—digit
level wam estimated by the same regression procedure, where posmible.

After

—

the

3—digit estimates were added,

14 —

and the data were weighted up to the 2—digit

level,

regressions were run to estimate any missing 2—digit groups. In both

cases,

the weights used were 1963 OECD exports to the world.

After filling in as such data as needed, we created a master price file
for each country that contained all the necessary data at every level. These
are the files we used, weighted together using various weights,

to create the

various price indexes for total developed country exports and developedcountry exports to developing countries reported here.
III.

INDEXES OF "WORLD" EXPORT PRICES FOR MANUFACTURES

Weighting end Country Coverage
We have calculated two aggregate price indexes for exports of manufactured
goods by developed countries, differing in their weighting but not in the
price series used. One is an index weighted by the value of all exports of
manufactures by developed countries, including their exports to each other.
The other is an index weighted by the value of exports by developed countries
to developing countries. The former is relevant

to issues such as the terms of

trade between manufactures and primary products,

and the letter is more rele-

vant to discussions of the terms of trade between developed end developing
countries.
Both of these indexes were constructed with two sets of weights:

1963

exports by all OECD countries end 1975 exports by the same countries. The
developed market economies, a class almost equivalent to the OECD, accounted
for B2 per cent of the world's exports of manufactures in 1965, B4 per cent in
1975, and 78 per cent in 1985.

Of the exports by developed market economies,

those countries covered by our indexes (although not necessarily covered for

—

all

15 —

commodities) accounted for 77 per cent or, in other words, about 60 per

cent of world exports of manufactures.6
Effects of Differences in Time Period Used for Weighting
Two time periods,
indexes

1963 mnd 1975, have been used to weight the price

for all developed-country exports and exports froe developed countries

to developing countries. If we compared the price movements between 1963 and
1975 derived from the two measures,

it would be equivalent to the familiar

comparison of Laspeyres and Paasche price indexes, with the index on the 1963
weight base the Laspeyres price index (or the one based on earlier weights)
and the index on the 1975 weight base the Paasche price index. An increase

in

the 1963-based index relative to the 1975-based index would imply a negative
covariance between prices and quantities,
1975—based index would imply

a

while a relative increase

in the

positive covariance. We could associate the

negative covariance with a situation in which events were dominated by changes
in supply, with demand relatively stable.

The positive covarianca implies a

situation dominated by changes in demand, with supply relatively stable.7
The differences in the trend of prices produced by the ahift in weight
base from 1963 to 1975 were as follows:

In every case, the index with a later weight base rose less than the one with
an earlier base, implying the dominance of changes in supply and substitution
in favor of products for which price incresses were relatively small.

The

difference was larger in the index for all countries than in any of those for
individual

countries.

That fact implies thst in addition

to substitution

among commodities, there was also substitution smong countries

in favor of

those with relatively declining prices, presumsbly those in which productivity
and export supply were incressing most rapidly.
Despite the fact that there were wide divergences among the countries in
the size of the increase

in prices over the period as s whole,

the effects on

the price indexes of chsnging weights were fairly small, rsnging only from
3 per cent for the US snd Germany to 5 per cent for Japan. That narrow range
reflects the fact that the same weights are used for all the countries'
indexes.

In the case of the export price indexes based on own—country weights,

shown in Appendix C, the differences are considerably larger, ranging from 3
per cent for Germany to 9 per cent for Japan and the U.S.

dominance by supply changes and substitution toward products

within U.S. and Japanese exports than within German

exports or those of all developed countrie as a group.
The relationship between indexes based on the two sets of weights varied
somewhat among commodity divisions. In most cases, the later weight base was
associated with a smaller price increase, but there were some exceptionm, em

Export Prices to the World end to Developino Countries
Since the composition of exports to developing countries might be different from that of exports to other countries, it is conceivable that they
faced larger or smaller price increases than other buyers. That poamibility is
examined below for manufactured goods as a whole and the four major categories
of manufactures.

In most cases,

exports to the world (and therefore exports to the deve-

loped world to a greater degree) increased more rapidly in price over the
three and a half decades than exports to developing countries. That was the
case for sanufectured products as a whole, and for SITC divisions 6, 7, and
8.

The largest differences, over 10 per cent, were in SITC 8, a category

in which the developing countries were themselves substantial

exportera.

An earlier version of the price indexes for exporta to developing
countriea was compared,

(1984), to the UN unit value

in Krsvis and Lipsey

index for manufactures that ia customarily used for calculations of manufactured goods prices and terma of trade.

The conclusion was that pricea of manu-

factured goods exported by developed countries

to developing countries had

risen much lesa than had been suggested by the unit value indexes,

something

in the neighborhood of 75 per cent over the period from 1953 to 1976, as compared with 140 per cent for the unit value index. About a half of the dif-

ference stemmed from the corrections for quality change and the other half
from some mixture of differences in the type of price data used (pricea vs.
unit values),

in index number formulas, and in country coverage.

Adjustments for Quality Change
The proper treatment in a price index of changes in the quality of goods
has been a controversial issue for many years. A considerable amount of work
has been done,

particularly by the application of hedonic methods,

to adjust

domestic price indexes for changes in quality that are supposedly not adequately accounted

for, even in price indexes gathered

tion to quality specifications. Most of thia research

with considerable attenhas been directed to

consumer and producer capital goods, almost all of which are included in
SITC

omitting quality change have pleyed a role in discussions of the long—run

trends in the terms of trsde (Haberler,

1959; Viner,

1953, p. 114). The only

direct applications of hedonic methods to international trade prices that we
are aware of, mainly for deriving price level comparisons, were in Kravis and
Lipaey (1971). In a study of the terms of trade between manufactures and primary products, Kravia and Lipmey (1984) used hedonic indexes constructed for
domestic prices to adjust indexes of export prices of manufactured goods, and
we follow similar procedures here.
There are many possible ways of using these domestic price adjustments
for quality to correct international

price indexes.

Since these calculations

have been performed only for domestic prices, it is necessary to assume that
any adjustments in domestic prices were equally applicable to U.S. export prices. The hedonic price indexes are available only for the United States, and
for only a few commodity groups even for the U.S.

we make in the

U.S. indexes are probably minimal,

Therefore, the adjustments
and those for the world can

be considered to be no more than rough approximations that give some notion of
the direction end range of conceivable quality corrections.
One possibility would be to assume that the adjustments apply only to the
U.S..

If the quality adjusted U.S. indexes mre combined with conventional

indexes for other countries, the result

is a very conservative estimate of the

effect of such adjustments on world or developed country export price movements.

That estimmte of the quality change omitted from conventional measures,

provided by the meriea demcribed below ma "adjusted for U.S. only," is conservative in several respects. One is that it assumes that the upwmrd bias in
price indexes from this source effects only the U.S. data, an unlikely possibility.

Another is that most of the hedonic price indexes end with 1983, and

—

21 —

no adjustment can be made for later years in even those groups for which it
was performed earlier. A third reason is that

a

number of price indexes that

should be corrected for quality change were not, because appropriate indexes
were not available.
The procedure of correcting only U.S. prices is likely to leave an upward
bias in a world price index.

Ideally,

we would like to have similar hedonic

price measures for all countries, but failing that, we believe it is more

appropriate to assume that any quality adjustsent applied to, for example,
U.S. computer and parts prices,

is equally applicable to the corresponding

prices of other countries than to assume that the unmeasured quality change is
confined to the U.S.

Also,

on this assusption, if an otherwise empty cell for

computer prices is filled in one country by a hedonic price index, it should
be filled in the other countries

by thiThane type of index. The assumption

implied by that procedure is that the law of one price in time—to—time form,

poor as we have found its predictions to be (Kravis and Lipmey, 1978), still
provides a better guess for these products than the assumption that, for
example,

computer prices in countries other than the U.S. move with all other

prices in those countries. The indexes based on the assumption of identical
price movements in all countries for products for which hedonic price indexes
were used are described below as "adjusted for all countries."
This procedure of assuming identical price changem for a product in different countries is at variance with the method implied by our earlier conclusion that country influences, rather than commodity influences, were dominant
in determining price changes. However,

that conclusion reflected mainly the

impact of exchange rate changes and differences in inflation rates on price
aoveaentm. The application of identical quality adjumtaenta to a commodity in

—

different

22 —

countries reflects our judgment that radical changes in technology

in an industry auch as computers, for example, probably outweigh the country
influences on price changes.
that

a

That judgment is influenced partly by the fact

substantial part of exports of machinery from countries outside the

U.S., especially in the cosputer industry,

originates in subsidiaries of U.S.

firms, and therefore embodies U.S. technological

developments.

The effect of the quality adjustment applied to a few groups in SITC 7,
Machinery and Transport Equipment,

can be seen from the following

comparison:

If the adjustment is performed only for the U.S., the effect on the world
export price index for manufactures is fairly small: only about .15 per cent

—

23 —

per year for aanufactures as a whole and about

.25 per cent per year for SITC

7. If the corresponding quality adjustments are spread to other countries, the

effect is multiplied. For manufactures as

•a

whole,

it is almost a half of one

per cent per year, and for SITC 7 it reaches almost one per cent per year.
The quality adjustments for manufactures as a whole would be larger for an
index based on U.S., or especially Japanese, export weights because SITC 7 is
more important in the exports of those countries than in those of developed
countries as a group.
These adjustments are too gradual and not large enough to produce a different picture from the standard one of short-term fluctuations in the terms
of trade between manufactures end primery products,

or the termm of trade of

individual countries. They are large enough, and sufficiently constant in
direction, to give a very different story about long—term trends in prices and
terms of trade.

IV.

INDEXES OF EXPORT PRICES, EXPORT PRICE COMPETITIVENESS,
AND CORRESPONDING DOMESTIC PRICES

The price indexes in Appendix B for all developed country exports of
manufactures and for exports by developed countries to developing countries
are constructed from indexes for individusl
the same set of weights.

However,

countries

that are all based on

these are weights that reflect the impor-

tance of products in world trade as a whole rather than in the trade of each
country.

To explain the exports of a single country, such as the U.S., we con-

sider an index based on that country's export weights more relevant. For this
purpose, we have constructed price indexes for each country's exports that are
based on the weight of aach product in the country's exports.

We have then

—

constructed price

24 —

indexes for competitors based on the sese set of weights.

Thus, for the U.S., we hsve en export price index end s competitors' price
index,

both bssed on U.S. export weights.

All of these ere shown in

Appendix C.
For the individual country, the price index is s conventional export price
measure,

but unlike the indexes in Appendix B, which use domestic prices where

export prices are unavailable,

these include only export price data. The index

of competitors' prices is, in the came of the U.S., weighted by the same U.S.
export weights as the U.S. export price but includes both export price data
and, where they are not available, domestic

price data, am in the indexes of

Appendix B. That procedure produces manufactured goods price indexes for

Both the U.S. and German export prices rose from 1953 to 1971 relative to

those of other countries that sold the same export products. Japanese prices
fell enormously relative to those of its competitors during the same period,

with a decline of 25 per cent in relative prices. From 1971 to 1980, the U.S.
gained greatly on its competitors, with a fall of more than a third in relative prices. Japanese relative prices also fell during this period, although
not as much as those of the U.S., while German relative prices continued to
increase.

The corresponding changes for the period of the rapidly rising exchange
value of the dollar, which we can mark out as 1980 to 1985 in these annual
average data, and the subsequent period of the declining dollar, are shown
below:

The indexes show a large increase in relative U.S. prices during the rise of
the dollar and a sharp decrease during the next three years, with the net
result being some increase over the eight years. The movements for Germany
were the reverse of those for the U.S., but involved a small overall decrease
in relative prices. The changes for Japan were a relative price increase in
1980 to 1985, despite the rise in value of the $US, and an additional

increase

after that, quite seal] considering the sharp increase in the exchange value
of the yen.
Perhaps the most surprising feature of these price measures

is the

apparent relative increase in German prices after 1985 without a corresponding
reflection in German export shares. One possible reason for this seeming lack
of response to price changes is that.Germen exports gained from the growth and

Another is that the omission of Italian and Belgian
along with poor coverage of French prices, par-

ticularly of machinery in the earlier years, may have caused these indexes for

—

German competitors'

prices

27 —

to be biased upwards.

These relative price indexes are similar to those we have referred to
elsewhere as indexes of price competitiveness (Kravis and Lipsey, 1971),
although the price competitiveness measures

were based on OECD weights for the

individual countries, as are those for individual
this paper. The relation between these measures

countries in Appendix B of

and broader concepts

of com-

petitiveness, including "nonprice" aspects, was discussed in the earlier work.
The "price competitiveness" measures were not intended to encompass all the
economic influences on that broader concept,

although the price measures must

reflect some of the broad movements in relative productivity and costs that
are part of changes in a country's competitiveness. We think of relative price
changes,

as we have measured thea, as useful for reduced form trade equations.

In more structural trade models, the export price changes become endogenous
variables in supply equations.8
Even if these indexes have a more logical basis than the ones usually
used to analyze trade, an obvious question is whether they produce any more
reliable estimates of elasticities or better explanations of the flow of
trade.

An authoritative answer to that question could only come from attempta

to use these measures in various types of trade equations and models of trade.

We can report on a few experiments along these lines with earlier versions of
the indexes.
In one of these experiments (Kravis and Lipsey,

1974), we estimated

elasticities of substitution between U.S. and German exports of metals, machi—
nery, and transport equipment to third-country markets using,

as alternative

price measures, indexes of the type constructed here from export price datm
and indexes based entirely on domestic prices. We considered the test to be

—

more favorable

to the doaestic

price

28 —
indexea than a comparison based on the

usual published indexes because we reweighted the domestic prices by inter-

national trade weights to match the export price indexes.
The results of the comparison were that the degree of explanation was
between twice and three times as greet in equations using the export price
indexes,

and the elasticity estimates were much higher. Furthermore, the

response of relative exports was almost the same for a change in U.S. prices
as for a change in German prices, while in the equation based on domestic prices, the elasticities were quite different.
A later version of these indexes covering machinery and transport equipment was used in Bushe, Kravis, and Lipsey (1986) to explain changes in U.S.,
German,

end Japanese exports. It is difficult to compare the results with

those of other studies because of differences in commodity coverage and time
periods, but one conclusion was that the differences among countries in price
elasticities were smaller than had been estimated using other price data.
However,

we could not be sure whether our use of more accurate price data or

our confining the comparison to the same range of commodities was the explanation for the greater similarity of elasticity coefficients. Another conclusion
was that lags in price effects on U.S. exports were much longer, extending out
to 4 years, than those in most previously estimated export equations, and that
the United States might have to wait a long time for any relief from the
effecta of the high value of the dollar in the eid—1980s."
Margins on Export and Domestic Sales
We have alao calculated (Appendix C) domestic price indexes for exported
manufactured goods for the U.S., Germany, and Japan, using each country's export price weights. These data can be used to examine changes in the ratio of

export

29 —

to domestic prices for each country.

exported goods changed identically,

If coats for domestically sold and

that ratio reflects the direction

of

change in gross profit margins in export as compared with domestic salem and
also,

if domestic price movements are a good proxy for cost changes,

the

direction of change in export margins themselves. With the extreme volatility
of exchange rates that has characterized the 1980s, and the observation that
prices of Japanese goods in the United States have not risen in line with the
depreciation of the dollar since 1985, there has been

a

renewal of interest

in

this issue with- several studies of changes in the export/domesticprice margin
or "pricing to market" (Krugman,

1987;

Marston,

1989; Mann,

1986).

However,

as noted below, the phenomenon of pricing to market was evident to some degree
in earlier periods,

although not as dramatically as in the years since 1985.

On the whole, we would expect relative declines in export margins in
periods when the exchange value of the currency is increasing or, more
generally, when domestic prices are rising sore rapidly than those of competitors.

We would expect rising margins in periods of falling currency

values or falling relative domestic prices.
The results for the U.S. from 1953 to 1980 do not give much support to
these expectations. U.S. export prices hardly changed relative to domemtic
prices from 1953 to 1971 when U.S. prices were rising relatively, and they
declined relative to export prices in 1971 to 1980 as U.S. prices fell-with
the depreciation of the dollar.

The export/domestic price ratios for Germany and Japan did move in the
expected direction during the period of mostly fixed exchange rates from 1953
to 1971. In the first period of changing exchange rates, 1971 to 1980, the
German ratio was stable even as German relative prices increased,

end the

Japanese ratio fell even while Japanese prices were declining relative to
those of competitors. That was a period in which Japan was under great
pressure to expand exports to offset the rise in petroleum import costs.
The 1980 to 1985 period of great exchange rate turbulence and rising
exchange value of the dollar saw somewhat surprising changes in
export/domestic price ratios. U.S. export prices rose relative to domestic
prices despite a large increase

in U.S. export prices relative to competitors.

German export prices fell relative to domestic prices, although German export
prices were falling relative to those of other countries.
prices hardly changed in comparison to domestic
relative to foreign countries' prices.

That 14 per cent fall in the export/domesticprice ratio for Japan between
1985 and 1988 suggests that there must have been a vary large decline in relative margins on exports.

A similar sat of identically weighted export and domestic price indexes
was used in Kravis and Lipsey (1977a and 1977b) to study separately the impact
of exchange—rate changes and of differences in inflation rates between
countries on ratios of export to domestic prices from the early 1950s through
the mid—1970s. We interpretad changes in those ratios, as we do here, as evidence of changes in margins on export sales relative to those on domestic
sales.

U.S. export margins appear to be sensitive to changes in the U.S.

exchange rate with the

Dli

and the Yen, and also to changes in relative infla—

—

tion

rates between the U.S.

32 —

and the U.K.

German export margins were less

well explained but responded to differences in inflation

rates between Germany

and the U.S., the U.K., Japan, and France. Japanese export margins,
period of more stable exchange

rates,

responded

in the

more to European and U.S.

business cycle movements than to exchange rates, but in the 19705 began to
respond to exchange rate changes as well. The reactions to exchange

rates and

inflation rates could be summarized as a consistent response to changes in
real exchange rates, over the whole period for the U.S. and Germany, and in
the 1970s for Japan as well.

The estimates covering all Japanese manufactures

for whet Merston (1989) refers to as PTM elasticities, are somewhat

lower then

his for individual products in the 1980s, but suggest that the phenomenon is
not a new one.
Concluding Remarks
Aside from the indexes for 1953—1964,

drawn at least partially from our

own date collection, all the indexes shown here are calculated from official,
publicly available, date. Therefore, aside from possible additions to the
country coverage mentioned earlier,

further updating of the weighting, end a

shift to e quarterly basis in place of the annual indexes presented here, most
mejor improvements in the date would require actions by the official
producing the date. An exception, open to outside scholars,

agencies

might be en exten-

sion of the hedonic price calculations to countries other then the United
States.
Among the improvements in the official date thet would be useful would be
extension of the coverege of price series in countries for which there are
major gaps in the deta. French dete ere among the poorest in this respect
among the countries we cover.

In addition,

the cmlculmtion of export end

—

import price indexes based on

price,

33 —
rather than unit value, data,

is still

confined to a small group of countries, although the recent attention to
"pricing—to—market'

and pass—through issues suggests that there is a great

deal to be learned by having separate dosestic and international price data.

There are, in addition,
official

two other types of issues involving the quality of

price data that have not been extensively addressed, although both

were discussed in Kravis and Lipsey (1971). One is the treatment of intracom—
pany trade which, with the increase in the internationalizationof firms and
the increasing share in trade of the kinds of products in which international
transactions tend to be internal

to firms, is now a very large part of deve-

loped countries' trade. It is not clear to what degree the prices reported for
such trade are artificial and to what degree they therefore distort export and
import price measures.

The principle suggested in Kravim and Lipsey (1971) wam

to ume the price in the first arms length male in a country in preference to

intracompany prices, where that is possible, and we still believe that is the
appropriate practice.

For a U.S. export, for example,

which the U.S. wholesale or retail trade affiliate in

it would be the price at
a

country mold the pro-

duct rather than the price at which a U.S. manufacturer sold to its overseas
subsidiary. And for a U.S. import it would be, for example, the price at which
a Japanese car was sold to an unaffiliated buyer in the U.S. rather than the
price at which the Japanese manufacturer "mold" it to its U.S. sales
affiliate.
Another type of question is raised by the very small extent to which U.S.
firms admit selling at different prices at home and abroad, in contrast to the
large differences reported by foreign firsm. While it is conceivable that U.S.
company trading policies are very different

in this respect

from those of

other

34

—

countries, it is slso possible thst since the export snd domestic prices

are collected by the same agency in rsther similar ways, companies tend to
report

the same prices. For this reason, as well as others that have at times

been suggested to price collection agencies, even for dosestic
price collection, it would

3We define manufactures here as divisions 5 through 8 of the SITC Revision 1. The most serious omission for comparison with domestic industrial
data is of manufactured foods, although there are also some other minor
oeismionm, some of which were rectified in Revision

2

of the SITC. We did not

adopt them here because the indexes could not be recalculated to match the
later classification without a major effort.

5Within the developed market economy groups, of the $217 billion of manufactures exports by countries we did not cover, the largest omitted country
was Itmly, with $68 billion in exports, followed by Belgium/Luxembourgwith
$40 billion end Switzerland with $32 billion. Other European countriem, for
which at least some detailed domestic producer or wholesale price date could
probably be obtained with sufficient efforts, were the mourcem of another $67
billion. Thus, Europe am a whole accounted

for 95 per cent of the manufactured

exports of developed market econoimiem that we did not cover.
Of the $265 billion in manufactured exports by other groups of countries
in 1965,

22 per cent of the total, over 60 per cent were exports by developing

countries, and the rest were from centrally planned economies. The $167

-

billion

from developing countriem were concentrated in Southeast Amian

countriem. More than 40 per cent were from Hong Kong, Korea, and Singapore,
and the concentration in Amia would be even higher if the figurem included
Taiwan, omitted from UN tabulationa.

APPENDIX A
Sources of Price Date
Export Prices
The German price data appear in Statistisches Bundesast, Preiae, Löhne,
Wirtschaftarechnungen,Reihe 1, Preise and Preisindizea fUr Aussenhandela—
gUter.

A brief description is given in Angersann (1980), and in articles in

Wirtschaft und Statistik, such as Rostin (1974). The Japanese export
price
data are published in the Price Indexes Annual, earlier the Export and Import
Price Indexes Annual, of the Bank of Japan. The U.S. export price data are
from releases of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics entitled,

"U.S. Import

and Export Price Indexes." A brief description of these is given in
Comparisons of U.S., Germen, and Japanese Export Price Indexes, BLS Bulletin
2046,

1980.

Export price data for other countries were sore fragsentary. Two publications of the Central Bureau of Statistics of the Netherlands,

Maandstatistiek

van de Binnenlandse Handel and Bijvoegsel Pleendstatistiek van de Prijzen,
provided export price data with incomplete but increasing coverage.
For the U.K., there are virtually no export price data outside thm period
covered by Kravia and Lipaey (1971). The exception is a set of export price
indexes for products in SITC 7 for 1976 through 1979, part of an experimental
program that was later discontinued.
Swedish export prices are reported in various issues of publications of
the Central Bureau of Statistics, the latest of which is "Pricindex i
producent—och importled 1988" (1989). Soae of the indexes are based on unit
value data, and we tried to avoid using these as far as possible,

preferring

—

the

42

—

data on doaestic prices aentioned below.

Domestic Prices
For Canads, wholessle price indexes sre from tapes provided

by Statistics

Canada.

Domestic price data for the U.S. were price series at the most detailed
level from a BLS Wholesale Price Index tape.

For the U.K., some individual

series were collected from publications of the Board of Trade and the
Department of Trade and Industry. However,

the U.K. did not publish indivi-

dual series for most machinery or "engineering" groups for many years. For

we used a set of

these,

indexes at the two—digit

SITC level calculated for us

by the Board of Trade from detailed price data using DECD weights we supplied.
For later years, we could not obtain these series and were obliged to use a
similar set of two—digit indexes calculated by the Department of Trade and
Industry based on U.K. export weights.

For more recent periods,

beginning in

the 197Dm, fairly detailed price indexes for machinery have been published in
annual

price articles such as "Wholesale Price Indices in 1981," in British

Business, 7 May 1982, and "Wholesale Prices in 1982," in British Business,
S May 1983.
The German domestic price indexes are individual
Preise,

series published

in

Ldhne, Wirtschaftarechnungen,Reihe 3, Preise und Preisindixes für

industrielle Produkte,

Index der Erzeugerpreise,

and Reihe 8, Index der

Grosshandelsverkaufspreise(StatistischesBundesamt, Wieabaden). The Japanese
domestic price indexes are also individual
Annual

series from the Price Indexea

and the Wholesale Price Indexes Annual, published by the Bank of Japan.

Swedish domestic producers price indexes are from the source listed above
for export price indexes, but many more detailed indexes are availsble for
domestic prices.

French prices through

43 —

1977 for a large number of products were kindly

supplied on tape by Dr. Liliane Crouhy—Veyrac of the Department Economie,
Centre d'Enseignement Superior des Affaires.

These data were the basis for

Crouhy—Veyrac, Crouhy, and Melitz (1980). These data were supplemented by
information from "Lea Indices des Prix de Gros Base 100 en 1982," the Bulletin
Mensuel

de Statistigue de la France and the Annuaire Statistique de la France,

all published by INSEE.

The other Cain set of data are the hedonic price indexes substituted for
conventional price series in our calculation of the quality—adjustedprice
index.

These indexes are originally from a number of sources, but most of

them were collected in Gordon (1990).

The exceptions were the price indexes

for computers from Cartwright (1986) and Cartwright and Smith (1988) and those
for semiconductors, from Norsworthy and Jang (1990).

Notesto Appendix Tables 817 and 818

The hedonic price indexes for the commodities listed below were substituted for the conventional U.S. export or domestic price series used for the
indexes

covering SITC 7, and All Manufactures in Tables 813 through 816. The

hedonic indexes were also inserted

in a few cases for which no conventional

price indexes had been available, so that the commodity coverage in Tables 817
and 818 is slightly higher than in the earlier tables.

froe Table 61? are combined with the indexes for other countries in the

same way as for Tables 61 through 64.
For the indexes labeled "Adjusted

for All Countries," each U.S. hedonic

price index was substituted for the conventional price index for that particular
SITC subgroup or group at the three or, usually,

four digit SITC level (or

inserted where there had been no conventional index) in the index for every
country.

The individual country indexes for all sanufactures and the world

indexes were then aggregated,

uncovered

groups and subgroups, the substitutionwas

performed by subtracting the unadjusted indexes from the SITC aggregate and
adding back the adjusted indexes with the same weights.
