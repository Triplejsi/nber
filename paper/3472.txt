objective of the work reported in this peper is to fied if the
consumption data from the six waves of the Retiremont History Survey are
consistent with the life cycle hypothesis of consumption ani to test the
importance of a bequest motive for saving. The 12 data itats which are used
cover an estimated 36% of total consumption; the most important datum is food
consumption. The findings support the life cycle hypothesis: as required,
omasured consumption among the elderly declines with age. A test of the
bequest motive for saving based on the variation by extended family stricture
in consumption paths provides no support for a bequest motive.
