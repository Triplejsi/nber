I. Introduction
Different models of political cycles emphasize either the "opportunistic"

or the "partisan" incentives of policymakers. In "opportunistic" models, the
policymakers maximize their popularity or their probability of reelection. In
"partisan" models different political parties represent the interests of
different constituencies and, when in office, follow policies which are
favorable to their supporting groups; specifically, the left wing

parties are

more concerned with the problem of unemployment, while the right wing parties
are relatively more willing to bear the costs of unemployment to reduce
inflation.

This literature has developed in two clearly distinct phases. The first
one, in the mid—seventies, is due to the influential work by Nordhaus (1975),
and Lindbeck (1976) on "opportunistic" cycles and by Hibbs (1977)

on

"partisan" cycles. These papers share a "pre—rational expectations" model of
the economy and are based upon an exploitable "Phillips curve". The "political
business cycle" model of Nordhaus predicts pre—electoral fast growth and low
unemployment; raising inflation around the election time and a post—electoral

recession, regardless of the political orientation of the incumbent. Hibbs'
partisan model implies systematic and permanent differences in the
inflation/unemployment combination chosen by different political parties.

Macroeconomists soon lost interest in this subject, because at that time
the profession was developing (or fighting against), the "rational

expectations revolution. "
The second phase took off in the mid—eighties as a branch of the game—

theoretic approach to the positive theory of policy. Cukierman and Meltzer
(1986), Rogoff and Sibert (1988), Rogoff (1990), and Persson and Tabellini
(1990) propose rational "opportunistic" models; Alesina (1987) develops a

2

rational partisan approach. These models depart from their predecessors in
two important dimensions. First, the assumption of economic agents'
rationality makes real economic activity less directly and predictably

influenced by monetary policy. Second, voters' rationality implies that they
cannot be systematically "fooled" in equilibrium.

This second generation of models has empirical implications which are

quite different from those of the earlier literature: the assumption of
rationality reduces the extent and the likelihood of regular political cycles,

although it does not eliminate them. For example, in models with rational
economic agents and voters, Nordhaus' type cycles are mitigated. Rather than
regular multi—year cycles on output and unemployment, one should observe,

according for instance to Rogoff and Sibert (1988), short—lived electoral
cycles on monetary and fiscal policy instruments, but not necessarily on

economic activity outcomes. Alesina (1987, l988b) shows that in a partisan
model with nominal wage contracts and rational voters, permanently different
inflation rates across parties may result only in temporary, post—election
differences in output and unemployment.

Finally, Ito (l990a,b) and Terrones (1989) study political business
cycles with endogenous timing of elections, an institutional setting which is
very common in parliamentary democracies.

This paper addresses two questions. First, whether or not the dynamic
behavior of GNP growth, unemployment and inflation is systematically affected

by the timing of elections and of changes of governments. Second, whether or
not the second generation of rational models has provided useful insights to

interpret the evidence. The paper suggests an affirmative answer to both
these questions by examining 18 OECD democracies, in the last three decades.

3

Our results can be summarized as follows: a) The "political business
cycle" hypothesis, as formulated in Nordhaus on output and unemployment is

generally rejected by the data. (Some favorable evidence can be found in only
two countries.) In every country, with the exception of Japan, we also reject
the extension of the "political business cycle" model, with endogenous timing
of elections; b) inflation tends to increase immediately after elections,
perhaps as a result of pre—electoral expansionary monetary and fiscal

policies; if confirmed by direct evidence on policy instruments, this result
yields support to the Rogoff and Sibert (1988) and Rogoff (1990) model of
"political budget cycles"; (c) we find evidence of temporary partisan
differences in output and unemployment and of long—run partisan differences in
the inflation rate as implied by the "rational partisan theory" of Alesina

(1987). This pattern appears rather unambiguously in countries with a pure
two—party system, or with clearly identifiable "right" and "left" coalitions;
(d) we find virtually no evidence of permanent partisan differences in output

and unemployment. Indirectly, results (c) and (d) yield some support to the
positive model of inflation developed by Kydland—Prescott (1977) and Barro and
Gordon (l983a,b).

The qualitative features of these results are consistent with the finding
on the United States by Alesina and Sachs (1988), Alesina (l988a) and Chapell

and Keech (1988). The advantage of a multi—country study is that, of course,

one has many more degrees of freedom. Elections and changes of governments
are relatively infrequent events. Thus, the researcher is left with very few
observations and only one country is considered. This is why systematic
multi—country studies are particularly useful in this area.

4

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we highlight the

empirical implications of several models of political cycles. Since several
comprehensive reviews of the literature have recently appeared (Alesina
(1988a), Nordhaus (1989), Persson and Tabellini (1990)) we sketch the various

models very succinctly. In Section 3 we present regressions on a panel data
set of all the countries in the sample. Section 4 discusses the results of
country by country regressions. Section 5 checks the robustness of our
results by employing Hamilton's (1989) method of timing recessions and

expansions. Section 6 considers the issue of endogenous timing of elections.
The last section concludes.

2. Models of Politico—Economic Cycles
2.1 The "Political Business Cycle" (Nordhaus (1975))
The assumptions underlying Nordhaus' "political business cycle"
(henceforth PEC) can be characterized as follows:

A.l) The economy is described by a Phillips curve:
—

ay1

+ y(ir —

ir)

÷

0 <

a

< 1;

> 0.

(1)

where y is output growth; iv is inflation; ,e is expected inflation; £ is a

random shock with zero mean; a, 7

are

parameters.2 The autoregressive term in

(1) captures various sources of persistence. The "natural" steady state level
of growth is normalized at zero, with no loss of generality.

A.2) Inflation expectations are adaptive:
—

'Tt—l + A(,re1

—

ic1).

0 < A< 1

A.3) Inflation is directly controlled by the policymakers.3

(2)

5

A.4) Politicians are "opportunistic": they only care about holding
office, and they do not have "partisan" objectives.

A.5) Voters are "retrospective." They judge the incumbent's performance
based upon output growth and inflation during the incumbents' term of office,
and heavily discount past observations.

A.6) The timing of elections is exogenously fixed.
Under these assumptions, Nordhaus derives the following testable
implications: (i) every government follows the same policy; (ii) towards the
end of his term of office, the incumbent stimulates the economy to take
advantage of the "short rum" more favorable Phillips curve; (iii) the rate of
inflation increases around the election time as a result of the pre—electoral
economic expansion; after the election, inflation is reduced with

contractionary policies A

This basic model has recently been developed in two directions: first
by investigating the role of rationality and second the role of endogenous

timing of the elections. These two extensions are illustrated below.

2.2 Rational Political Business Cycle Models
Persson and Tabellini (1990) propose a simple model which summarizes the

basic insights of this approach, due to Rogoff and Sibert (1988). Assumptions
A.l, A.3, A.4, and A.6 as in Nordhaus are retained. Assumption A.2 is
replaced by:
A.2')
A.2' ')

,1e —

E(lrt/I

:

rational expectations

includes all the relevant information except the level of

"competence" of different policymakers.

6

Assumption A.5 is substituted by:
A.5') Voters choose the candidate which is rationally expected to deliver
the highest utility, if elected.
A.5'') There are no differences in voters' utility functions.

E(.) is the expectation operator and 'tl is the information set of the
voters at time (t—l) when expectations are formed. A.2'') implies an
asymmetry of information between the policymakers and the voters: the former
know their own competence, but the latter do not.5

Policymakers' "competence"

is defined as their ability of keeping unemployment low with

a relatively low

level of inflation.6
By taking advantage of this informational asymmetry, and by trying to

appear as competent as possible before elections, politicians behave in a way

leading to a Nordhaus' type PBC. However, given voters' rationality and
awareness of politicians' incentives, the latter are limited in their

"opportunistic" behavior. Thus, the resulting cycles are more short lived and
less regular than in Nordhaus' model.
The original proponents of the "competence" model, i.e. Rogoff and Sibert
(1988) and Rogoff (1990), consider a budget problem, rather than an
inflation/unemployment trade—off, but with identical assumptions about the

distribution of information. These papers have empirical implications on
opportunistic cycles on monetary and fiscal variables, rather than on

unemployment and output. In fact, the model by Rogoff and Sibert (1988) has
implications on the inflation rate similar to those of Nordhaus'

model, but

does not imply any correlation between elections and output or unemployment.

7

2.3 Endogenous Elections

Ito (1990a,b) and Terrones (1989) remove assumption A.6: the latter
extends Rogoff's (1990) model, while Ito (l990a,b) presents a simpler model in

which while the policymakers are strategic in choosing the timing of
elections, the voters follow rules of thumb in their voting behavior, That
is, Ito maintains A.5, while Terrones adopts A.5' and A.5''. These papers
suggest that early elections are called to capitalize on good economic

conditions. Thus, the better the state of the economy, the sooner elections
are called.

Using Ito's simple and very insightful framework, suppose that the
government has no control on real economic activity and that voters' behavior

is described by A.5. Then, if high growth occurs soon after an election, the
incumbent may choose to call another election; if, instead, growth is low, he

waits: he has a good chance of capitalizing on a high growth period by
calling an election later in his term of office. However, as time elapses
from the previous election, the date at which an election has to be called

according to the law approaches. Then, even an average level of growth may
trigger an election; this is because the incumbent wants to avoid the risk of

reaching the last period with low growth. Thus, the probability that an
election is called should be an increasing function of the time elapsed from
the previous election and of the state of the economy.

2.4 The "Partisan Theory"; Hibbs (1977), (1987)
A strong version of the "partisan theory" (henceforth PT) based upon a
non—rational expectation mechanism, adopts assumptions A.l, A.2, A.3 and A.6.
Assumptions A.4 and A.5 are substituted by:

8

A.4') Politicians are "partisan," in the sense that different parties

maximize different objective functions. Left wing parties attribute a higher
cost to unemployment relative to inflation than right wing parties.
A.5''') Each voter is aware of the partisan difference and votes for the
party which offers the most preferred policy.
The assumption of partisanship is justified by the distributional

consequences of unemployment. In periods of high (low) unemployment, low
(high) growth and low inflation the relative share of income of the upper

middle class, increases (decreases). On this point, see Hibbs (1987).
Not surprisingly, this model implies that different parties choose

different points on the Phillips curve: output growth and inflation should be
permanently higher and unemployment permanently lower when the left is in
office than with right wing governments.7

2.5 "Rational Partisan Theory" (Alesina (1987))

Alesina (1987) and (1988b) suggest a "rational partisan theory"

(henceforth RPT). This model adopts assumption A.l, A.2', A.3, A.4', A.5'''

and A.6. The objective functions of the two parties can be written as:

—

Wi —

_o

ciJ2

—

bL{y

—

KiJ]

0

1;

(3)

where i — L,R identifies the "left" and the "right" parties. The difference

between the two parties can be summarized by at least one of these three sets
of inequalities:

cL>cRo; bL>bRO; KL>KRO

(4)

9

The last double inequality implies the time—inconsistency problem in monetary
policy pointed out by Kydland—Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (l983a,b).
Since at least one of the two parties targets a level of output growth which
is above the natural rate (normalized at zero), it introduces an "inflation

bias" because of the lack of precommitments in monetary policy. Thus, a test
of the RPT is indirectly a test for this specification of policymakers'
obj ective functions.

This model generates a political cycle if we assume that uncontingent
labor contracts are signed at discrete intervals (which do not coincide with
the political terms of office) and that electoral outcomes are uncertain
because of shocks to voters' preferences or to voters' participation rates in

elections. The basic idea of the model is that, given the sluggishness in
wage adjustments, changes in the inflation rate associated with changes in
government create temporary deviations of real economic activity from its
natural level.

More specifically, the following testable implications can be derived
from the model:

(i) at the beginning of a right wing (left wing) government

output growth is below (above) its natural level and unemployment is above
(below); (ii) after expectations, prices and wages adjust, output and
unemployment return to their natural level; after this adjustment period, the
level of economic activity should be independent of the party in office;
(iii) the rate of inflation should remain higher throughout the term of a left
wing government; note that this occurs even if cL — cR in (3), as long as

KL > KR or bL > bR.

That is, the time consistent (but sub—optimal) inflation

rate remains higher for left wing parties even after the level of economic
activity returns to its natural level.

10

2.6 Previous Empirical Results

Most of the empirical studies on political cycles use post—war United
States data. The evidence in favor of the RPT is relatively strong; evidence
of "opportunistic" PEG is found for certain policy instruments (particularly

government transfers) for limited sub—samples: for recent surveys of this
empirical literature see Alesina (1988a) and Nordhaus (1989).

Multi—country studies are more scarce. Alt (1985) is the first one to
formally test for partisan patterns in unemployment in twelve OECD democracies

and finds evidence quite consistent with this approach. Paldam (1979) finds
very weak evidence (if any at all) of Nordhaus' political business cycle on
output and unemployment using a sample of seventeen OEGD countries. The same
author (l989a,b) finds stronger evidence of partisan effects using annual

data. Alesina (1989) provides some qualitative tests with annual data using
the same sample of countries; his results suggest that the RPT is broadly
consistent with the evidence while the same paper does not find clear evidence

of PEG on growth and unemployment. Alvarez, Garrett and Lange (1989)

suggest

that the degree of success of "partisan policies" may depend upon the

characteristics of labor market institutions and of unions' behavior. On the
contrary, Sheffrin (1989) finds inconclusive results for the RPT. However,
Sheffrin's definition of TMunexpected change" of governments is questionable.

That paper disregards the fact that in several countries the same

party or

coalition was elected repeatedly with no electoral uncertainty. (See Alesina
(1990)).

The contribution of the present paper is that, unlike its predecessors,
it considers all the different theories, including models with endogenous

elections, in a unified framework. Furthermore, unlike the recent work by

11

Alesina and Paldam, we use quarterly data rather than annual data and make use

of different and more robust statistical tests. The use of quarterly data is
quite important since the precise timing of cyclical fluctuations in relation
to elections and changes in political regime is crucial for the theories.

3.

Panel Regressions

3.1 Data
We consider all the OECD countries which have been democracies in the

sample period considered, which is 1960 to 1987. The extent of the sample is
limited by availability of quarterly data; in fact, for some countries not all

the series are available even for this period. The countries included are:
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Cermany, Japan,
Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland,
United Kingdom, and the United States.
The economic data are quarterly observations on inflation, output growth,

and unemployment. Inflation is defined as the yearly rate of change of the
CPI from IMF, IFS. Output growth is obtained as the rate of change of real
CNP (or CDP), also from IMF, IFS. For unemployment, we use the total
standardized unemployment rate from OECD. More details on country specific
data issues can be found in Table A—l in Appendix. The political data are
election dates, the dates of changes of governments, and the political

orientation of various governments. This information is summarized in Table
A—2. Dates of regime changes and elections do not always coincide in
parliamentary systems in which changes of coalitions take place not only after
elections. Sources for these political data are Alt (1985) and Banks (1987).
The identification of changes of political orientation of governments is

12

usually unambiguous. Whenever ambiguities occurred in the case of large
coalition governments, we followed Alt's and Ranks' conventions. It should be
noted the countries for which positive results for the partisan theory are
found, are those in which there are no ambiguities about the classification of
government political orientation.

3.2 Specification of Empirical Tests
The most direct way of testing the various theories is to run the
following panel regressions of time—series cross—section data, for instance on
output growth:

—

a0

+

+

a2y2

...

ay

+

°n+l PDUM +

(5)

yt is the stacked vector of time—series data on output growth for the
countries in the sample and PDUM is a political dummy which captures the

implications of the different theories. The autoregressive specification for
the dependent variable is chosen as the "best" using standard techniques.
Similar regressions have been performed by McCallum (1978), Hibbs (1987),

Alesina and Sachs (1988) and Alesina (1988a) on U.S. data. These tests are
based upon the assumption that output growth and unemployment are generated by
a covariance—stationary stochastic process that can be expressed in
autoregressive form as in (5).
Since the sample includes open economies (most of which are "small"),

we

must control for the effect of the world economy on domestic economies, for

two reasons. First, the "partisan" or opportunistic goals of the politicians
are likely to be defined, in small open economies, in relation to the rest of

the world. Second, regardless of the governments' goals, international trade

13

and financial linkages make OECD economies highly interdependent.

We have followed two approaches to capture these effects. The first one
is to redefine each country's variable as a difference between the actual

variable and a proxy for the OECD average of the same variable. The second
one is to add as a regressor in eq. (5) a proxy for a world or OECD average.
Our results concerning the relative performance of various political models

are insensitive to the procedure used. As an indicator of an OECD average of
each economic variable we consider the average of the seven largest economies
in our sample, which are the USA, Japan, Germany, France, the lix, Italy, and

Canada, weighted by each country's share of GNP over the total.8
In the remainder of this section we present results of panel regressions

on the different political theories of the business cycle. We make use of a
fixed effect model with constant slopes. By doing so we take into account
differences in long—term growth rates, unemployment, and inflation across
countries but we assume that the other parameters of the model are constant
and equal across countries.9

3.3 The "Rational Partisan Theory" (RPT)
The political dummy used is:
in the N quarters starting with that of
a change of government toward the right

+1

DRPTN —

in the N quarters starting with that of
a change of government toward the left

—1

0

We tested the cases of N —

otherwise

4,6,8.

This choice of number of quarters is

consistent with a wage contract model in which contracts have an average
length of 1 or 2 years.

14

Note that the variable DRPTN assumes values different from zero only
following actual changes of governments, but not after every election if the

same government is reappointed. According to the RPT theory, inflation
surprises and thus output fluctuations may occur even if an incumbent is

reappointed unexpectedly (Alesina, 1987). However, for long periods of time
in many countries in the sample certain parties repeatedly won elections with

virtually no political uncertainty. Furthermore, in countries with endogenous
timing of elections, which are the large majority of the sample (see Table A—
2), in every period there is at least "some" probability that

an election is

called and that a change of government may occur.-0 In addition, in

parliamentary systems sometimes government changes occur in the middle of a

term, with no elections. Rather than trying to estimate the degree of
political uncertainty in every period, which would be rather difficult if not
impossible, we have chosen to estimate a somewhat weaker form of RPT, testing
for temporary effects on real variables after actual chanees of governments.

An additional reason for doing so, is that several macroeconomic models in the
"neo—Keynesian" tradition, imply that not only unexpected, but also expected

aggregate demand policy may have some real effects. Thus, according to these
approaches, stronger effects should found after actual changes of governments,
with actual changes of policies, relative to the case of reappointment of the
same government.

in quarter t. •The regressors are self explanatory: yW is the world growth
average (described above); the AR(2) specification has been chosen as the
"best" using standard techniques; the remaining regressors are country
dummies.

The political dummy DRPT6 has the correct sign and is statistically

significant at the 1 percent confidence level: a change in government to the
right (left) leads to a transitory fall (increase) in output growth. The one
quarter lag in the political dummy is consistent with a reasonable interval
between change of regime (in quarter t) and change of policy (in period t+l).
The regressions with DRPT 4 and DRPT 8 (available upon request) yield

analogous results: the pattern of the coefficients suggests that partisan
effects are observable from about the second to the eighth/ninth quarters

after the election. These results are consistent with findings on United
States data by Alesina and Sachs (1988) and Alesina (1988a).12
In column 2 of the same table we present the result of the same

regression for a subset of countries which have either a "pure" two—party
system or at least more clearly identifiable "left" and "right" coalitions.
These are US, UK, France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, and Canada.
The other countries in the sample have more fragmented political systems with
govertiments formed with large coalitions of parties (often center—left) which

sometimes are short lived and unstable. For obvious reasons, the second group
of countries is less likely to exhibit regular partisan cycles. In the second
regression, in fact, the coefficients on the political dummy are much larger
in absolute value and even more precisely estimated.

16

The values of the coefficients in the second column of Table 1 imply that
about eighteen months after a change of regime toward the right (left) the

rate of growth of CNP is about 1.3 percent below (above) "normal". Thus, the
difference in the rate of growth between the beginning of a left wing
government and the beginning of a right wing government reaches a peak of
about 2.6 percent.

In Table 2 the dependent variable is the difference (U1') between the
domestic unemployment rate, (Ut) and the "OECD unemployment rate," UW,

defined analogously to the average GNP growth. In evaluating results on
employment one has to be cautious because of problems of hysteresis (see

Blanchard and Summers, 1986). By taking the difference of domestic
unemployment from a world weighted average, unit roots problems are somewhat

mitigated, but certainly not eliminated. Table 2 shows results which are
quite consistent with those on GNP growth. The political dummy is significant
at the 1 percent level and the fit improves when the sample is restricted to
seven bi—partisan countries (note that New Zealand is missing from these

regressions because of lack of quarterly unemployment data). The dummy DRPT6
is lagged two quarters to capture the slow response of unemployment to policy

changes relative to output. In any case, analogous results (available

upon

DRPT4 and DRPT8 are used. The values of the coefficients in the second column

right (left) the unemployment rate is about 1.5 percentage points above
(below) normal)-3

Let us now turn to inflation. The theory implies that one should observe

permanent differences across governments on the inflation rate. Thus, we have
defined a political dummy, RADM, as follows:

÷1

if a right wing government is in office, including the quarter of the change of government

—1

if a left wing government is in office including the quarter of the change of government,

RADM —

In Table 3 the dependent variable is domestic inflation (it)

rate

—

defined

as the

cpIt —cPI

100 . The variable for world
t—4
inflation (,iM) is defined analogously to the world output growth. 14

of change of CPI:

In the first regression, which includes the entire sample of countries,
the sign of the coefficient on RADM(—1) is correct and it is marginally
insignificant at the 10 percent level Ct — —1.55).

The second regression

includes only the eight "bi—partisan" countries: here the coefficient on
RADM(—l) is larger and significant at the 5 percent level.

The value of the coefficients in the second regressions imply a
difference in the steady state inflation rate between the two regimes of about

1.4 percent. This relatively low value reflects the fact that our sample
includes the sixties, with a low and stable inflation and countries, such as

Germany, with a low inflation rate throughout the sample period. We have run
the same regressions of Table 3 for the post—fixed exchange rates regimes,

from 1972.1 to 1987.4. In these regressions (available upon request) the
coefficient on the RADM dummy is more precisely estimated and implies (in the
sample of 8 "bi—partisan" countries) a difference in the inflation rate across
political regimes of about 2.5 percent.

In fact, we have tested whether all the regressions of Tables 1, 2 and 3
improve in the post 1971 period, since in the fixed

exchange rate period

(1960—71 in our sample) the macroeconomic policies of each countries were more

constrained and integrated. All the t—statistics on the political dummies
improve and the value of the coefficients increase in absolute value in the

post 1971 regressions, which are available. However, the problem in pursuing
this comparison, pre and post—1971, is that there are very few changes of

regimes in this period (see Table A—i); in many countries there are

changes
of regimes in the sixties. Thus, the political dummies pre—1971 regression

would be very imprecisely estimated and hard to compare with the post—1971
sample.

In summary, these results are favorable to the RPT. The implication of
this hypothesis is not rejected on both the level of economic activity (growth
and unemployment) and inflation, particularly for a sub—set of countries with
more clearly identifiable government changes from left

to right and vice

versa. 15

3,4 "Partisan Theory" with Permanent Effects
Hibbs' PT implies permanent differences in output and unemployment in

addition to permanent differences in

inflation across governments. Thus, one

way of comparing the Hibbs' PT with the RPT is to run the same regressions of
Tables 1 and 2 using the "permanent"

partisan dummy RADM rather than the

"transitory" political dummy DRPTN. The results are shown in Tables 4 and 5:
all the coefficients on the political

dummy are insignificant, even though

with the right sign. In these tables the fixed effects coefficients are not
reported since they are very similar to those of Tables 1 and 2.

regressions with alternative lag structures (for instance lagging RADM more
than one quarter) yield no support for the theory.

The results of section 3.2 and 3.3 viewed together, indirectly provide
some empirical support to the inflation bias model of Kydland and Prescott

(1977) and Barro and Cordon (l983a,b). In fact, these regressions show that a
permanent difference in inflation rate is associated with temporary deviations

of output and unemployment from trend. Thus, the governments that are more
concerned about growth and unemployment relative to inflation, after a
temporary initial expansion, are caught in the sub—optimal equilibrium with an

inflation bias. In fact, inflation remains high even though the level of
economic activity returns to its "natural" value. This is precisely the
feature of the sub—optimal time consistent equilibrium.

3.5 The "Political Business Cycle"
Nordhaus' (1975) PBC model can be tested on growth and unemployment by
constructing a political dummy of the following form:

1

C

We have chosen N —

in the (N—I) quarters preceding an election

and in the election quarter

NRDN —

otherwise

4, 6 and 8. A relatively short pre—electoral output

expansion is consistent with this theory based upon a short sighted

electorate, Nordhaus (1975, 1989). Furthermore, since in many countries in
the sample several elections occur in less than four year intervals, a longer
specification of the preelectoral period would seem unreasonable.

20

Tables 6 and 7 report the results on

output and unemployment for the 18

countries in the sample, using NRD6. (The fixed effect coefficients are not
reported.) In both tables the coefficients are insignificant; in the growth
regression the coefficient has the opposite sign from the

theory prediction.

Several alternative specifications with NRD4 and NRD8, using the difference of
domestic growth from the world as the dependent variable and alternative lag

structures, yield no support for the theory.16 In fact, the coefficient on
the political dummy has the "wrong" sign in the majority of the regressions.
We also tested whether the bIRD dummy approaches statistical significance,

when partisan effects are held constant.
and the NRD dunjnies were run. Once

while the DRPT dummy remained

Regressions including both the DRPT

again no support for the PBC was found,

statistically significant (results are

available) 17
The PBC not only as formulated in Nordhaus (1975) but also, with caveats
discussed above, in the "rational" models

by Rogoff and Sibert (1988) and

Persson and Tabeilini (1990) implies an increase of the inflation rate around

elections. In particular, the model by Rogoff and Sibert (1988) implies that
pre—electoral manipulation of monetary and fiscal policy, used to signal the
government competence in providing public goods and services without raising
taxes implies an increase of inflation

immediately after each election.

Furthermore, governments may prefer to raise prices under their direct control
after, rather than before elections, thus

directly contributing to a post

electoral upward jump in inflation. We have tested this implication in Table
8, where the dummy ELE is defined as follows:
1

in the 4 quarters following an election, and in

the election quarter.

The dummy ELE is significant at the one per cent level. Additional
regressions (available upon request) confirm that the upward jump in inflation
does not occur before the election, but only in the election quarter and lasts

three to five quarters. If confirmed by direct findings on policy
instruments, this result suggests that around elections monetary and fiscal

policy instruments may be manipulated, even though these policies do not seem
to affect real economic activity, as implied by Rogoff and Sibert (1988) and

Rogoff (1990). Alesina (1989) presents some qualitative evidence which
suggests the possibility that budget deficits increase in election years.

4. Country Results
In this section we analyze country by country results, starting with the
RPT.

Table

9 reports the results on CNP growth. For each country in the

sample we report the regression with the best fit chosen between the six

dummies DRPTN(—J) with N —

4,6,8

and J —

1,2.

Countries may differ with

regard to the time delay in implementing a new policy after a regime change or
with regard to how persistent the transitory increase in output will be after

the policy change. This is the reason why the best fit for DRPTN might occur

at different lags for different countries. For economy of space, we report
the results on unemployment in Appendix (Table A—3) without comments. The
results of Table 9 are very consistent with those on unemployment: the rare
differences will be pointed out. Table 10 displays the results on inflation.
We report the "best fit" within five regressions with R.ADM(—J) J —

1,.. .5.

Longer lags in the inflation regression, relative to the growth regression,
can be easily explained by the lag between output and inflation movements

(e) Germany had a large coalition of right and left parties between 66:4 and 69:1; also,
following Alt (1985), the entrance of the FOP in the Social Democratic government in 72:3
is considered a movement to the right. To consider the movement from the right to center-

left in the 66-69 period and from left to center in the 72-82 period, the variable RADM
assumes the value of -0.5 (instead of -1.0) in the first period and the value of -0.5
(instead of -1.0) in the second period. This finer variable (ADM) is lagged five quarters
i.e. (-5).

(f) For analogous reasoning to those ascribed to Germany, we used the ADM variable for
Austria.

following changes in macroeconomic policies. The results can be summarized in
three points:

1) In a large group of countries which includes Australia, Denmark, Germany,
France, New Zealand, the US, and the UK, all the regressions on growth,
inflation and also unemployment (see Table A—3) show clear evidence of RPT,
although not all the coefficients on the political variables are significant

at the usual confidence levels (5 or 10 percent) in every regression. Note
that Table A—3 shows that the regressions on unemployment for Australia,
Denmark, France, Germany and the U.S. show a five percent level of

significance on the coefficient on the political dummy (Table A—3). The
results on the UK are greatly strengthened if the sample is restricted to the

post—fixed rates period. The regressions on the sample 1970—1987 in Tables 9
and 10 show significant coefficients on the political dummy at the 5 percent

level. The significant difference between the pre— and post—1971 results for
the UK is explained primarily by the observation of the labor government

elected in October 1964. This government, constrained by a commitment not to
devalue the pound, could not pursue expamsionary policies. Thus, 13K growth in
this period (1964—66) does not outperform the relatively rapid OECD average
growth.

2) In a second group of countries which includes Austria, Belgium, Finland,
Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the coefficients on the political
dummies exhibit the sign predicted by the theory sometimes approaching
statistical significance, in either the growth or unemployment regressions

(Table A—3) but no significance in the inflation regression. In particular,
Sweden has a five percent significant coefficient on DRPT6 in the
equation.

growth

23

3) Canada and Italy show no significant coefficients in any regressions. The
case of Canada, however, is explained by the almost perfect correlation

between the US and Canadian business cycle. In fact the US

political dummies

are statistically quite significant (five percent confidence level) in the
Canadian equations!1-8 Thus, it is not clear whether for the purpose of this
paper Canada really provides an independent observation.
In summary, leaving aside Canada, six of the seven countries with more
clearly identifiable left—right governments (that is the US, Cermany, France,
the UK, Australia, and New Zealand) plus Denmark exhibit evidence of RPT

effects. One bi—partisan system, Sweden, is unclear. All the multi—party
parliamentary systems with large coalition governments show little

sign of

this type of cycle, particularly on inflation.19

Let us now turn to PT with permanent effects: Table 11 reports the
country by country results on CNP growth. For each country we have chosen the
best fit between three regressions with political

dummy RADM(—J) J —

1,2,3.

The results for unemployment, which quite consistent with those on output, are

in the Appendix (Table A—4). Only Cermany does not reject the PT. For Sweden
the coefficient is borderline significant, but there is no indication of
partisan behavior in either unemployment (Table A—4) or inflation

(Table 10).

All the other countries clearly reject the theory; in several cases the
coefficient on the political dummy js opposite to the theory prediction.
Table 12 reports country by country results on output for the PEC model;

results on unemployment are in Table A—S. In Table 12 we have chosen the best
specification between NRD4 an4 6.

In four countries, Cermany, Japan, UK and

New Zealand the coefficient on NRD is significant. In Australia and France
the coefficients have the sign inconsistent with the theory and are

All

the other coefficients are

Table 13 reports the country results on inflation. Several countries,
such as Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, and New Zealand show significant (ten

percent or better) post—electoral upward jumps in the inflation rate. In
several other countries (e.g., Japan, Norway, and UK) the sign is correct but

the t—statistic does not reach a significant level. Thus, in only two
countries, Germany and New Zealand, both the level of economic activity and
the inflation rate follow the predictions of Nordhaus' "political business
cycle" model.

5. Tests of the RPT model using Hamilton's (1989) model.
It would be interesting to derive direct measures of the dating of the
business cycle in different countries and study their relation to the

political variables. Obtaining estimates of the dating of the business cycle
is not easy, either empirically or conceptually. The empirical problem is
that, while in the United States the NBER offers already—made estimates of the
peaks and troughs of economic activity, similar and comparable measures are

not available for the other OECD countries. From a conceptual point of view,
the recent literature on unit roots and GNP has offered a number of
alternative approaches to the problem of distinguishing between trend and
cyclical components of output. Most of the literature20 is based on the
assumption that GNP growth is characterized by a linear stationary process.
In a recent paper, Hamilton (1989) studies the implications of specifying
the first differences of log GNF as a nonlinear stationary process.

Hamilton's idea is to consider the economy as characterized by two states, a

high—growth (expansion) state and a low—growth (recession) state and model the

switch between these two states as being governed by a Markov process. One of
the bi—products of the estimation of the model is a nonlinear filter that
delivers optimal estimates of the dating of the business cycle based on past

observations on output. In particular, for each quarter the filter provides
an estimate of the probability that the economy is in a recession (or a boom)

given the information available in the data. Using this filter, Hamilton
(1989) finds that "the best statistical estimates of which quarters were
historically characterized by negative growth states for the U.S. economy are

remarkably similar to NBER dating of business cycles". These results suggest
that one could use the same statistical approach to derive estimates of the
dating of the business cycle for other OECD countries in our sample.
In this sectiàn we first derive estimates of the dating of the peaks and
troughs of the business cycle for a sample of OECD economies using Hamilton's
switching Markov model and then test the relation between these estimates of
the business cycle and the changes in political regime suggested by the RPT

model. Our use of Hamilton's approach is suggested by its success in tracking
the NEER dating of the business cycle in the United States and its ability to
deliver a synthetic estimate for each quarter of the probability that the
economy was in a high growth (expansion) or low growth (recession) state.
Given the positive evidence in favor of the RPT model for countries with

two—party systems we have considered only these countries.21 To control for
the effects of the world business cycle on the growth rate of the various
economies, in our maximum likelihood estimates of Hamilton's model we take
yDIF (defined as the difference between country i growth rate and the average

26

growth rate of the major OECD countries) as the two—state variable to be
explained.

Once we have obtained an estimate of the dating of the business cycle, we
perform a regression of the estimated probability (PROBS) of being in a low
growth state (relative to the OECD average) on a constant, the dummy for the

RPT model (DRPTN) and the first lag of the dependent variable. The latter is
introduced to capture the observed persistence of the probability of being in
a particular state of the world. In other terms the basic regressions is:
PROBSt —

+ a1 PROBSt 1 + °2 DRPTNt 1 + t

(6)

Table 14 reports the results of fixed—effects panel regressions of

equation (6) above for 7 "bi—partisan" countries22. The political variable
(DRPT6), used to capture the effects of the RPT model, has the correct sign
and is statistically significant at the 1% confidence level.
In Table 15 we report the results of separate time series regressions for

each of the seven countries considered. The coefficient on the RPT dummy
(DRPT) is significant at the 10% confidence level in five of the seven

countries (5% for United States, France and Sweden). These five countries

are: United States, Germany, France, Australia and Sweden. The DRPT
coefficient for the United Kingdom is significant (at the 10% level) only if

we start the sample in 1970 (as discussed above). The seventh country, Canada
does not show statistical significance for the RPT variable but, as discussed
in the previous section, the Canadian business cycle is mostly driven by the
U.S. cycle.

Endogenous Elections

An empirical test of the model of Ito (1990a) is as follows. Define
as the probability that an election is called at time t and assume that an
election was held in period r and that, according to the law, an election has
to be held at least every n periods; Ito's model implies that

Table 16 displays this probit regressions for every country in the sample

in which the timing of elections is endogenous. Following Ito (l990a) the
variable TL is defined as the number of quarters elapsed from the preceding
elections while the other two regressors are output growth and inflation.

The results for Japan, which do not reject the theory, are consistent-

with those of Ito (l990a,b). However, except possibly for Finland, no other
country in the sample supports the theory; in fact, there are at least as many
signs inconsistent with the theory as there are "correct" signs, even though
in either case they are all insignificant.

Several different specifications of (7) were estimated in addition to

that presented in Table 16. First, we used the economic variables
(y and ir) defined in difference from the world average. Second, we tried

various lag structures. Third, following Ito (l990b) we used different
measures of the time elapsed from the previous election; we defined
Tl —

and 12 —

+ O.OOt — (r—t) and we tried both of them (each at a time)

instead of (r—t) in (7)23 The results of all these

regressions (available

upon request) confirm the results of Table 16.
These negative results should not be interpreted as a rejection of the
basic, insightful idea of strategic choice of election

timing, for several

reasons. First of all the economy is only one of the variables which may
influence the choice of calling an election. A major success in foreign
policy, or various events affecting negatively the

public image of the

opposition, may be strategically used by the incumbent.

and non—economic factors would be

,

with

unified control rather than coalition

governments. In fact, different members of coalition
on the optimal time for calling an election, since

governments may disagree

their expectations on their

relative popularity may diverge. Thus, in this institutional structure, the
decision about when to call an election,

appears much more as the result of a

non cooperative game between coalition members rather than an optimal
strategic decision of a unified government.

Finally, one may argue that,

particularly for the cases of weak coalition governments, the reverse
causation may be also important:

governments collapse and elections have to

be called early, when the economy is doing poorly and the coalition cannot

agree on what to do (see Robertson (1983)). More

generally, in countries with

large coalitions and frequent elections (such as Belgium, Italy, the
Netherlands) coalition collapses are probably the result of more complex
politico—economic factors than the short run state of the economy.

29

7. Conclusions
The most interesting result of this paper is that the more recent models

of political cycles significantly outperform their predecessors. The rational
"opportunistic" model by Rogoff and Sibert (1988) and the rational partisan
model by Alesina (1987) are consistent with the overall pattern of results for
several countries.

The main finding of this paper can be summarized as follows:

1) With the exception of three countries (Germany and New Zealand and,
possibly, Japan), we found no evidence of a systematic opportunistic cycle of
the Nordhaus type either for output or unemployment.

2) The opportunistic political business cycle model with endogenous timing of
elections is rejected in every country, with the exception of Japan.

3) An electoral cycle on the inflation rate, consistent with the models of
budget cycles of Rogoff and Sibert (1988), was found.

4) The implications of the "rational partisan theory" are consistent with the
empirical evidence particularly for a subset of countries with a bi—partisan
system or at least with more clearly identifiable political changes from left

to right and vice—versa. This theory is less applicable, and in fact tends to
fail, in countries with large coalition governments with frequent government
collapses.

5) The "partisan theory" with permanent effects on output and unemployment is
generally rejected.

Thus, a political cycle which seems to appear fairly consistently in

several countries is the following: left wing government expand the economy
when elected; for a while (about 2 years) they succeed, then inflation
expectations adjust and the economy returns to its natural rate of growth. At

30

this point, left wing governments are trapped into the time consistent
equilibrium with an inflation bias a

la

Barro and Cordon (1983b). Note that

when left wing governments approach the new election in this high inflation,
they may try to reduce the latter, particularly if inflation is perceived as

the main economic problem of the time (Lindbeck (1976)). When right

wing

governments are elected they fight inflation, causing a recession or a growth

slowdown. Later in their term, the economy goes back at its natural rate of
growth and inflation remains low.

Two explanations can account for the relatively little evidence of a

Nordhaus type opportunistic cycle on growth and unemployment: First, a
"rational" electorate imposes a limit on this behavior; an excessive attempt
to pursue opportunistic policies may be perceived as counterproductive by

policymakers. Second, it may be quite difficult to create expansions
precisely timed before elections.

However, the results on post—electoral inflation increase may signal the

occurrence of pre—electoral opportunistic budget policies. Alesina (1989)
presents some qualitative evidence which suggests that budget deficits tend to

increase in election years in several countries. Evidence on budget cycles in
the US is discussed in Tufte (1978), Alesina (1988a), and Nordhaus (1989).
Preelectoral fiscal "favors" to key constituencies may be electorally very
useful and easy to implement, relative to an attempt to increase the rate of
growth of CNP.

These opportunistic monetary and fiscal policies may very well coexist

with the partisan cycles found in the data. Even "partisan" politicians
prefer to be in office, rather than out; by being in office they can implement

their desired goals. Thus, they may engage in short term pre—electoral

31

opportunistic monetary and fiscal policies to enhance their chances for re-

election. Further research on a multi—country sample could shed more light on
this issue: in fact our results on inflation suggest that pre—electoral
manipulations of monetary and fiscal policy instruments may be the rule rather
than the exception.

32

Footnotes

1.

Furthermore, Nordhaus' "political business cycle" model did not receive a

convincing empirical support. Soon after the publication of Nordhaus' paper
Mccalluin (1978) and Paldam (1979) presented negative empirical results for the

U.S. and OECD economies respectively. More favorable results are shown by
Tufte (1978) on a sample including a few American elections.

2. By Okun's law the same model could be written in terms of the unemployment
rate.
3.

To be precise, Nordhaus (1975) assumes that policymakers control aggregate

demand and, indirectly, inflation. This difference is inessential and, in
fact, the more recent models simplify the analysis by assuming that the
government has direct control over the inflation rate.

4. Nordhaus' (1975) model predicts that inflation should increase before the
election. However, given time lags between the effects of aggregate demand
policies on output and inflation, it is possible to construct a model of the
Nordhaus type in which inflation increases immediately after, rather than

before the election. (See Lindbeck (1976)).
5. In Cukierman and Meltzer (1986) the asymmetry of information is related to
the knowledge of the realization of a random shock to the economy.

6. Formally, the degree of competence is modelled by adding a term in
equation (1) which changes over time and is known by the policymaker but

becomes known to the voter only with a lag. For an explicit test of this
"competence" model on United States data see Alesina, Londregan and Rosenthal
(1990)

33

7. Note that Nordhaus' PBC and Hibbs' PT can coexist. If one assumes that
politicians are both opportunistic and partisan and voters are retrospective
as implied by A:5, one obtains a "weaker" form of PT which incorporates

elements of pre—electoral opportunistic behavior. See Frey and Schneider
(1978) and Nordhaus (1989).

8. In the regressions for the seven countries included in the creation of the
proxy for the OECD averages, we have used different proxies which exclude the
country in the left—hand side of the regression.

9. A priori, the correct dynamic specification of the model could differ
across countries but in country by country regressions we found that the same
AR specification is the best for almost all the countries in the sample.
However, even if the same AR specification applies to each country, the
estimates of the coefficients on the dynamic part of the model could differ
across countries and suggest the use of a variable—slopes and variable—

intercepts model. Given the significant loss of degrees of freedom involved,
this procedure was not adopted. Furthermore, country specific results are
discussed in Section 4.

10. Ellis and Thoma (1989) present an extension of the partisan model for the
case of endogenous timing of elections.

11. It is known that in the case of dynamic fixed—effects panel models such
as the one estimated here, the correlation between the error term and the
lagged dependent variables might lead to potentially biased and inconsistent

estimates of the parameters of the model (see Hsiao (1986)). The problem is
quite serious in panel sets where the number of agents (N) considered is large
but the number of times series observations (T) is small (data over a very
short period of time) .

In

that case the maximum likelihood estimator of the

34

dynamic model is inconsistent even if the number of agents becomes very large
(see Anderson and 1jsiao (1982) and Nicke].l (1981)). The solution to this

problem is to use instrumental—variable methods such as those suggested by

Shargava and Sargan (1983) and Fakes and Griliches (1984). Our panel data
set, however, does not suffer of the above problem because of the use of a

long time series (usually 112 data points). As observed by Hsiao (1986), in
the case where the time period T over which data are available is

large, as in

our model, the parameter estimates of the standard fixed—effects dynamic model
are consistent.

12. Analogous results on the political dummy available are obtained by using
as a dependent variable the difference between domestic and world growth.
13.

The variable

shows in fact a high level of persistence. Given this

persistence, even a "temporary" policy shock as the one captured by the

dummy

DPRT6 has rather persistent effects.

14. One could add oil prices to the equation but the inclusion of the world
inflation variable already proxies for this role of oil shocks.

15. The significance of the coefficients of the political dummies in Tables
1, 2 and 3 does not result from the influence of any single country. If one
drops from the pull any of the 16 countries and retain the other 15, the

coefficients on the political dummies remain significant. These results are
available.

16. These results are available upon request.
17. An even more extreme version of this model of voters' myopia would imply
that they ignore the influence of the world economy on their countries'
performance and thus politicians simply attempt to expand their economies,

regardless of the world economy. This hypothesis can be tested running the

35

same regressions of Tables 6, 7 without correcting for the effect of the world

economy. The results (available upon request) show no support for the PEC.

18. Results are available upon request.
19. Our results regarding the RPT theory on output growth and unemployment
are confirmed by another set of regressions in which we used a distributed lag
of the variable representing the changes in partisan regime, instead of the

DRPT variable. For the countries in which tables 9 and A—3 show a significant
DRPT effect we find that an F—test on the distributed lag variable rejects the
null hypothesis that the sum

of

all coefficients is equal to zero. These

results are available upon request.

20. See Nelson and Plosser (1982), Campbell and Mankiw (1987), Watson (1986),
Clark (1987), King, Plosser, Stock and Watson (1987).

21. Given our results in Table 9, Hamilton's tests on the other countries are
not likely to support the theory.

22. New Zealand is excluded from the sample because of lack of quarterly
data.

23. Tl is simply the number of quarters elapsed from the previous election as
a ratio of the maximum number of quarters between elections (i.e., n). T2 is
constructed such that it assumes a very high value (1000) when elections are

not anticipated. The idea is that the economy has no influence on the timing
in these cases (see Ito (1990b)).

a RIGHT or LEFT indicates the type of government in power at the beginning of
the sample which is 1959:1. We also indicate for each country whether
elections dates are endogenous or exogenous and the official number of years
between two elections.
b Elections denoted with an asterisk "*" are not included in tests of the
political business cycle theory because they are too close (less than two
years) to previous elections. They are however included in tests of the
opportunistic endogenous election model c Both Germany and Austria had grand coalitions of Left and Right parties.
Thus, a finer administration variable was used in the RPT inflation and
partisan (Ribbs) regressions. This also explains the occurence of a rightward
shift from an already central Right leaning party.

Table A-2 (continued

Source: Election Dates are obtained from Banks (1989); dates of changes of
government and their classification of "Right" and "Left" are obtained from
Alt (1985) and Banks (1989).
