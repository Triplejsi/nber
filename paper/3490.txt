ON THE ACCURACY OF PRODUCER PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS:
AN AUDIT BASED ON DETAILED FIRM-SPECIFIC DATA

by Ernst R. Berndt, Zvi Griliches and Joshua C. Rosett

"The probability selection now used ensures that the PPI will not be biased in
its sample of commodities; in the past, there was & tendency to choose mainly
volume-selling items made by large firms. . . .Of course, the voluntary nature of
the PPI program places the entire burden of index accuracy on the companies
that participate in the survey."
U. S. Department of Labor [1989], p. 3.
I.

INTRODUCTION
Producer price indexes (PPI's) are used extensively by analysts in the

private sector, in government, and by academic researchers. For example,
their use in decomposing the value of sales into price and quantity components
provides the basis for analyses of price-cost markups, rates of inflation,

investment, real output growth, and productivity changes. Given the essential
identity between value and a price index times a quantity index, any errors in
the PPI have important implications for the accuracy of measured rates of
inflation, real output changes, real investment, and growth in productivity.
The procedures by which the data underlying the producer price indexes
are gathered and assimilated are complex, and numerous opportunities for

systematic errors exist. Among the more often cited potential problems are
differences between list and transactions prices, the use of fixed weight
rather than chained indexes, the effects of quality change, and the speed with
which new goods are introduced into the PPI calculations, particularly in

industries characterized by rapid technological change. In addition, the
participation of firms in providing information to the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) for the PPI is entirely voluntary, and this raises issues of
sample selectivity.

Not much is known on how accurately in practice the PPI portrays representative transactions of firms in an industry. One reason for this lack of
knowledge is that to perform research on such an issue, analysts would require
specific price and quantity data on the universe of products for that firm
over time, as well as on the particular products sampled from it by the BLS.
Preferably, such data would be available for all firms in the industry.
However, the confidential nature of firm-specific price and quantity data by
product over time creates an important barrier to undertaking such research.
In this paper we report preliminary results of a detailed audit of one

component of the PPI, using data from a large multiproduct company. In
particular, we compare price indexes constructed in a variety of ways from the
universe of products of a large pharmaceutical manufacturer in the US, with
price indexes constructed from the particular products of this firm semDled by

the ELS, using BLS and alternative index number procedures. Our principal
finding to date is that a substantial disparity exists between price indexes
based on the BLS sample of this firm, and price indexes computed using the

universe of products manufactured by the firm. Although some variations
emerge depending on precisely how one undertakes the calculations, a typical
finding we obtain is that over a six-year period, based on monthly data from
January 1984 through December 1989, the BLS sample price index rises at
roughly twice the rate of indexes based on the universe of products

manufactured and shipped by this pharmaceutical irm. We also report results
of a preliminary attempt to uncover the source of this disparity.
We start our paper in Section II with an overview of the PPI. outlining
sampling procedures for establishments and particular products, and also

considering weighting and index number issues. In Section III we provide a
limited summary of the anonymous pharmaceutical manufacturer, which is sketchy

ensure confidentiality. The results of our empirical analysis are

presented in Section IV, and additional discussion of potential sources of

disparities is given in Section V. Finally, in Section VI we summarize our
findings and describe our agenda for further research.

II.

THE BLS PRODUCER PRICE INDEX FOR SIC 2834
The PPI is one of the oldest continuous statistical data

systems

published by the SLS, although until 1978 it was known as the Wholesale Price

Index (WPI). The WPI

originated

from an 1891 U.S. Senate resolution

authorizing the Senate Committee on Finance to investigate the effects of the

tariff laws upon the imports and exports, the growth, development, and prices
of agricultural and manufactured articles at home and abroad."1
The first WPI, published for the base period 1890-1899, was an

unweighted average of price relatives for about 250 commodities. Since that
time, many changes have been made, including alterations in the sample of
commodities, the base period, and the method of calculating the index.
According to the U.S. Department of Labor [1988, p. 125], the 1978 name change
from WPI to PPI "...was intended to reemphasize that the industrial

price

program continues to be based on prices received by producers from whoever
makes the first purchase, rather than on prices paid to wholesalers by
retailers or others further removed in the distribution chain."

Currently the

PPI program at 81.5 encompasses the construction of aggregate price indexes for

almost 500 mining and manufacturing industries, including approximately 8,000
indexes for specific product categories.
The 81.5 computes and publishes an overall price index for pharmaceutical

preparations (Standard Industrial Classification [SIC] code 2834), for
prescription pharmaceuticals (SIC 28341), and for roughly 50 sub-groups from

The PPI for the various pharamaceutial products are based on prices for a
fixed basket of products, drawn from monthly voluntary reporting to the BLS by

selected manufacturing

establishments. Several points are

worth making

here.

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

-

PAGE 5

First, the fixed basket of products is chosen througi a sampling procedure

implemented at irregular intervals across industries, whose frequency depends,

in part, on the perceived stability of the industry. Detailed surveys of
pharmaceutical firms were conducted in 1980 and in 1987, and the fixed baskets
were changed in 1981 and in January 1988; the BLS refers to the 1980 survey as

"Cycle I", and that from 1987 as "Cycle II.
Second, in principle, the sample is drawn from the universe of all

products from domestic establishments whose main production is in SIC 2834. A
BLS field representative visits selected establishments during the detailed
survey year, and uses a procedure called "disaggregation" to settle on which

detailed products are to be sampled. Once this initial visit is completed,
subsequent "repricing" for the selected coiodities occurs on a monthly basis.
typically by the respondent company filling out and returning forms sent to it
by mail by the ELS; these forms are pre-printed with the detailed description of
the chosen products, the reported prices over the previous three or four months,
and a request for a price quote from the Tuesday of the week containing the 13th

of the month. A sample blank copy of such a form, called Form 473P, is
reproduced from U. S. Department of Labor [1988, pp. 136-1371 in Appendix I.
Third, all PPI's are routinely subject to monthly revision every month for
four months after original publication (usually on the second or third Friday of
the month following the reference month), to reflect late reports and correc-

tions by company respondents. After four months, indexes are considered final.
Fourth, once monthly data are in hand, the BLS calculates the PPI
according to a modified Laspeyres formula in which the value of base period
quantities at current period prices is divided by the value of base period
quantities at (perhaps temporally different) base period prices, i.e.,

(1)

where Qa represents the quantity shipped during the weight-base period. P is
the current price of the commodity, P0 is the price of the commodity in the
comparison period, the summation is over i goods, but I subscripts are omitted.3
Note that this index is a weighted average of price relatives
Fifth, during the disaggregation process, products are defined in very

specific detail. As the U. S. Department of Labor (1986a, 19891 manuals
emphasize, any price-determining characteristic distinguishes one product from

another. The U. S. Department of Labor

[1988,

p. 126) summarizes price-

determining characteristics as follows:
"If a company charges more for a red widget than a white one,
color is one of the price-determining variables; if all widgets
sell for the same price regardless of color, color is not a
price-determining variable."

In the pharmaceutical context, if prices of bottles differ, a bottle of 100
pills each having SO grams of a drug is not the same as a bottle of 50 pills of
100 grams, even though both bottles contain 5,000 grams of the same

drug.

Moreover, transaction-specific factors such as volume discounts or freight costs
(if absorbed by the manufacturer) affect price, so these factors are included in
the definition of the product.

Sixth, precisely how the BLS

determines the total number of price

quotations assigned to each establishment is not completely clear, but

apparently this decision involves substantial judguent. According to the U. S.
Department of Labor (l986b, pp. 42-46], the number of quotes taken from an
establishment depends on industry concentration, price variations within and
across establistments, establishment size, and the number of products produced

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

at

-

PAGE 7 -

each establishment. Moreover, discussions with BLS personnel suggest that

for any sampled establishment in any industry, there is a minimum of two quotes
and a maximum of sixteen.4
Finally, although the BLS manuals emphasize that transactions rather than
list prices are desired, and Form 473P states clearly that "net transactions
prices are the most desirable type of price," the BLS also accepts net list
prices (with additional pricing terms listed separately, such as discounts for

prompt payment), or other estimates of prices. Despite the BLS emphasis on
transactions prices, our discussions with personnel at various pharmaceutical
firms suggest that firms typically interpret this request as being one for net
list rather that. net transactions prices.

For our purposes it is important to note that once detailed products have
been chosen by the disaggregation process, the BLS obtains a time-series of
prices for highly defined products which stay constant over fairly long
intervals - -

indeed,

the six years between re-sampling suggests that the list of

commodities is dominated by mature, rather than innovative products.
To understand the sampling process better, we now follow the PiLS procedure

and discuss its two distinct stages, in which the overall aim is to make the
probability of selection proportional to a product's value of shipments (VOS).
The first stage consists of choosing a random sample of establishments, drawn

from Unemployment Insurance files. In the second stage, specific products of
that establishment are chosen with probability proportional to VOS, although in
practice some products for SIC 2834 are certainty selected to ensure coverage of

important items.5 We now summarize these two stages.
The sampling frame for establishments is drawn from the Unemployment
Insurance data files (as updated and refined by BLS personnel), and in almost
all cases reported employment determines the probability of inclusion.6

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

Although

-

PAGE 8 -

use of VOS to choose the establishment sampling frame would be

preferable, the BLS justifies using employment as a proxy for VOS in the first
stage since employment figures are more widely available for establishments than
are data on VOS;7 moreover, BLS asserts that UI "...is used as a proxy in
sampling since the number of employees tends to be correlated with the revenue

of a Profit Maximizing Center within a particular SIC.8 If prices for several
establishments are set at one location (called a Profit Maximizing Center), then
the establishments (referred to as a cluster) are considered to be one
establishment, and the reported employment figures are appropriately suimsed.

It is worth noting that for two establishments with the same VOS, this
first-stage procedure assigns higher probability of selection to the
establishment with higher labor intensity, i.e. lower average labor

productivity. What this implies for the pharamaceutical industry is not clear,
although there is anecdotal evidence supporting the notion that generic drug
manufacturers are likely to be less labor intensive than are manufacturers with
large R&D facilities producing patent-protected products; if this were true,

generic drug manufacturers would be undersampled in this first stage. On the
other hand, some of the small genetic engineering companies that produce
innovative products may be relatively labor (research personnel) intensive, and
depending on how frequently the sampling frame is changed, use of the UI frame
could result in oversampling for such firms.
Once an establishment has been selected, in the second stage a BLS field
representative visits it and conducts an interview designed to select the items

to be priced and to collect base prices and value weights. The probability with
which a product is selected, given choice of the establishment and the number of
quotes assigned to it, is proportional to its VOS over the twelve months prior

to the interview. In this disaggregation process, in principle, VOS-based

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

-

PAGE 9 -

sampling probabilities are employed, but detailed information on pricedetermining characteristics is required for only a small subset of products.
This economy of required detail reduces the reporting burden on cooperating
companies, and results in an initiation interview that is "usually completed

within 2 hours."9
Within the disaggregation process, several additional steps occur. First,
all products are categorized into broad product classes. A running total of the
percent of VOS for each category is formed, and the number of price quotes to be
taken from within each category is determined by randomly choosing a first
percentile level and equally spacing the remaining quotes to be chosen.
For example, suppose there are three product categories and that five

quotes are to be chosen for the establishment as a whole. Let the first
category account for 50% of the VOS, the second for 30%, and the third for 20%;

hence the running total is 50%, 80% and 100%. Since five quotes are to be
chosen, a random percentile level from 1 to 20 is selected (note that 100%/S —

20%).

Suppose this random percentile level is 15.10 Then the additional four

quotes are equally spaced at intervals of 20; in this case, at 35, 55, 75 and

95. Because the 15th and 35th percentiles both fall within the first segment of
the running total (0% - 50%), two quotes will be chosen from the first category.

Similarly, 55 and 75 fall within the second segment, so two quotes will be

chosen from the second category. Finally, one quote will come from the third
category. This process of disaggregation is repeated within each category from
the first stage until an individual product involved in a particular transaction

is identified. The resulting unique transaction is then recorded in detail so
that future price quotes can be accurately identified by the reporting
establishment.

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

-

PAGE 10 -

As was noted earlier, in some cases selected product categories are
"certainty sampled" or "certainty selected". This can occur if it is felt by
the BLS that some item is of particular importance, or may be so in the future.
In the 1987 sample for specified companies, both diabetes and cancer therapies

are certainty selected. In this type of certainty selection, one item from
within the chosen category is selected using

normal

disaggregation procedures

(e.g., within SIC 2834 119 for cancer therapies, or within SIC 2834 127 for
diabetes therapies), the VOS for the entire category is subtracted from the VOS
of the establishment, the number of remaining selections is reduced by one, and
the disaggregation process is begun again from the beginning (without the

certainty

selected category).

certainty selected

This procedure is repeated

for any additional

items. A second type of certainty sampling occurs whenever

the percentage of VOS for a product class exceeds the sampling interval at that
level

of disaggregation.

-

For the pharmaceutical and paper mill industries, the Cycle II
disaggregation procedure differed from that for most other industries in two

respects.

First, rather than allowing the establishment to determine the

classes of products for the first step of the disaggregation process, the BLS
provided a table of product categories; such a BLS worksheet for SIC 2834 is

reproduced as Appendix II. In most industries no more than eight categories are
defined at each level of disaggregation, but in SIC 28341 there are 48 products

within the prescription pharmaceuticals section. The other difference from
normal disaggregation procedures is in the handling of the second type of

certainty selection, mentioned at the end of the previous paragraph. The normal
disaggregation procedure might result in "multiple hits", i.e. it might choose a

given product more than once. To avoid this, if a category is wider than the
sampling interval, then a product is chosen by disaggregation within the

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

-

PAGE 11

category, the VOS is deducted from the overall VOS for the establishment, and

the process is started again with the certainty selected item removed. Hence
multiple hits are not possible.11
Once the initiation interview is completed and the items for which price
quotes are to be obtained are determined, repricing occurs with reporting taking

place through the mail. From this the BLS obtains a time series of monthly
price quotes for each item sampled, defined in such a way so as to make the item
transacted and the transaction constant over time.
To construct PPI's, the sampled products are classified into cells,
typically at the seven to nine digit SIC level; the within cell index weights
are the VOS for the establishment divided by the number of quotes from the

establishment. Note that an item with a small VOS is given the same within-cell
weight as an item with a larger VOS, but that this is consistent with
probability sampling proportional to VOS, for the small item essentially
represents many other small items which, when combined, have the same

probability of selection as a single, larger item with the same VOS. As we
understand it, the within cell index is a fixed-base Laspeyres index adjusted
from month to month so as to show no change when product deletions occur.
Aggregated between-cell indexes are then created by weighting within-cell
indexes by VOS within the cells produced within the same industry; these VOS are

taken from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Census of Manufacturers.12 Thus,
shipment values for the same products made in other industries do not enter the

weighting structure.13 The total value of shipments for each industry is then
distributed among the products or other revenue sources produced by that
industry, thereby eliminating the need for indirect weight imputations, a
practice that was common under the pre-1978 methodology of the PPI.

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

- PAGE 12 -

As was noted earlier, the most recent detailed survey in pharmaceuticals
occurred in mid-1987, and beginning in December 1987, the PPI ws revised to
reflect the new sample of products, within-cell weights, and between-cell

weights from the 1982 Census of Manufacturers. Currently, PPIs for
pharmaceutical products are typicall.y based at 100 in June 1981.

Although in principle the PPI has been based on probability sampling since
late 1978, in practice it is clear that a number of departures from ideal

establishment selection and disaggregation occur. In addition to use of the
Unemployment Insurance rather than VOS data to choose establishments and the
judgmental manner in which the number of price quotes per establishment is
determined, the voluntary nature of the PPI introduces problems for BLS field

representatives. Not surprisingly, the U. S. Department of Labor [1986a,1989]
data collection manuals provide extensive advice to BLS field representatives
when the establishment employee interviewed by BLS personnel may not have or may

refuse to provide sufficient information for complete disaggregation. In such
cases, the BLS manuals provide faliback procedures, up to and including taking
whatever information the establishment is willing to provide on the products of

its own choice. Of course, the implications of such departures of practice from
theory are not clear,

III. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF "C0MPAIY X AJD ITS DATA
The pharmaceutical preparations industry in the U.S. is a relatively
unconcentrated one, with the concentration of sales being quite low; for
example, based on 1982 value of shipments, the 4-firm concentration ratio in SIC

2834 was 26%, the 8-firm 41%, and the 20-firm 67%)' Confidential data have
been provided us by "Company X, one of the 20 largest firms in the industry.
For each of hundreds of prescription pharmaceutical products produced by Company

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

PACE 13 -

X, we have been supplied monthly data from January 1984 through December 1989
(72 monthly observations) on net revenues, quantity shipped, average revenue
(revenue/quantity), and product identifiers.

These data were provided us in

printed form, and were then keypunched by us and our assistants. List price
data have not yet been made available to us. Net revenues are close to accrual
basis, implying that the computed average prices are close to the true average

prices for sales in the given month. However, it is worth noting that such
average prices could in principle be affected by the size and location of
transactions, and that no information is available to us on whether such

features of transactions have changed over time. The product identifiers allow
unique products (down to the presentation level) to be followed over time.
Hence products do not change over time, and presentation characteristics such as
form (vial, capsule), dosage, package size (count) and type (bottle, blister
pack) are known.
In addition to monthly series on these variables, Company X provided us
xerox copies of the monthly reporting forms it filled out for pricing surveys in

response to BLS requests. These forms indicate the list price
and various discounts for a number of detailed products in the Cycle I and Cycle

II surveys. The items selected by the BLS represent roughly a quarter of
Company X's total revenues in both cycles.
Additional product details were provided us by Company X, and these were
used to classify products into therapeutic classes as defined by the ELS.

Although we succeeded in classifying only 83% of Company X's universe of
products into specific BLS cell groups (see Table 1 for a list of these cells),
these successfully classified products accounted for more than 99% of revenues

over the sample period. Below, when we present price index data, we will refer
to these two product sets as "universe" and "classified", respectively.

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

-

PAGE 14 -

New products are of particular interest, for they may embody technological

innovations which allow therapeutic actions for which there is no known

price,

and the speed with which these new products are introduced into price index
calculations can substantially affect the measured overall rate of inflation.
Many of the new products Li Company X's data set are actually modifications of
existing product lines (new packaging, etc.), but other products are truly new
in the sense of being the first drug produced in a new class of pharmaceutical

products. We have also examined products that exit. The extremely small
revenue share of exiting products makes it difficult for them to have a
substantial impact on aggregate measures of price, and therefore we do not
explore exits in detail in this study.

IV.

PRINCIPAL EMPIRICAL FINDINGS
We now present our empirical findings to date, comparing various price

indexes based on Company X data with comparable BLS published price statistics.
Our results, expressed in terms of annual growth rates by year (1984 thru 1989)
and average annual growth rates (AACR) over the entire January 1984 - December

1989 time period, are summarized in Table 2. Detailed monthly series are
presented in Appendix III, Table A-i.
In the first row of Table 2 we show growth rates of the BLS published PPI
for SIC 28341 (prescription pharmaceutical preparations); the AAGR over the

entire time period is 9.O9%)- Then in the next row, entitled "ELS Sample of
X", we report a company-specific price index for Company X, based only on
transactions prices of its particular products sampled by the BLS, and using BLS

reasonably well, although the 1984-1989 AACR of 7.711 AAGR for the sampled
products is about 151 less than the 9.091 AAGR for the published industry-wide
PPI 28341, due primarily to substantial divergences in 1985 and 1989.
If we limit the product category of pharmaceutical preparations to

systemic anti-infectives. we j&d that the ELS sample of Company X matches

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARNACEL'TICAL PREPARATIONS

that

PAGE 16 -

for the aggregate ELS PPI for SIC 2834 111 a bit more closely; as is seen

in the bottom panel of Table 2, while the 1984-1989 AACR for the overall BLS
FF1 7-digit is 6.27%, that based on the BLS sample of Company X is 6.91%.

Based on these calculations, it appears to us that price trends of
products sampled at Company X are reasonably representative of those products

sampled for the industry in total. (The various price trends are presented
graphically in Figures I and II at the end of this paper.)

We now initiate an examination of the extent to which Company X price
indexes based on the universe of its products match price indexes based on the

BLS sample of Company X's products. This gives us a first look at how well
the set of products sampled by the BLS at Company X portrays X's transactions.
To do this, we have examined a number of BLS manuals and publications.

and have employed BLS index number procedures as we understand them (except we
use Company X quantity weights rather than BLS weights), along with price and
quantity data on the universe of products manufactured by Company X, to

construct a BLS-like price index for Company K. To mimic the effects of
Cycles I and II, our fixed weights are changed in January 1988, with the data

spliced accordingly. The results of this calculation are given in Table 2 in
the row entitled "X's Universe". There it is seen that the price index based
on X's Universe grows about 60% as rapidly as the AAGR of the BLS sample of
Company X (4.84% vs. 7.71%).

In the previous section of this paper we noted that we have been able to
classify about 83% of Company X's products into BLS 7- and 9-digit SIC codes;
these classified products account, however, for more than 99% of Company X's

total revenues. Using data from these classified products and following our
interpretation of BLS practices, we have computed a price index for all of
Company X's classified products; results are given in Table 2 in the row

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

entitled

PAGE 17 -

X's CIassified. Not surprisingly, growth rates of price indexes

based on X's Classified products are very similar to chose constructed using
X's Universe; the AAGR are 4.83% and 4.84%, respectively.
However, if we instead limit our focus to to systemic anti-infectives,
the divergence between the ELS sample of Company X's products and the universe
of all classified system anti-infectives at Company X is larger; as is seen in
the bottom panel of Table 2, the 1984.1989 AAQR for all infectives at X is
3.03%, less than half the 6.91% AAGR for the systemic anti-infectives sampled

by the BLS from Company X.
To

this point, therefore, we conclude that although there are soe

variations,

tend

growth rates

of

the alternative price indexes we have

computed

to fall into two distinct groups; one group consists of the published

industry PPI for the five and seven-digit SIC 2834-1 and 2834-111 plus the LS
sample of Company X, while the other is comprised of essentially the universe

of products at Company X. These two sets of price indexes are displayed
graphically in Figures I and II. Apparently, sampling procedures employed by
the BLS do not yield an accurate portrayal of representative transactions at
Company X.

It is worth emphasizing here that in our index number calculations
discussed in the previous paragraphs, we have mimicked ELS procedures
regarding the infrequent changes of product weights, keeping the January 1984

weights constant until the January 1988 Cycle II change. An implication is
that differences in growth rates between the BLS sample of X and X's Universe
or X's Classified price indexes cannot be attributed to the "new goods
problem", for in essence new goods are overlooked in all these calculations,
except for the January 1988 re-basing.

- PACE 18 -

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

Nonetheless, it is of some interest to examine the sensitivity of
computed price indexes to other procedures for introducing new goods into the

price index calculations. Note that the definition of what constitutes a
"new" good is somewhat ambiguous. In the calculations that follow, we
classify as "new" not only obviously new products, but also novel
presentations of old products, i.e., vial vs. capsule presentations, or dif-

ferent package sizes. We now briefly discuss results of several calculations
we have undertaken that shed some light on the "new goods" problem.
First, using X's Classified products, we have employed a Divisia price
index procedure with shifting revenue share weights over time, where new goods
are introduced as quickly as possible into the price index, and revenue share

weights are adapted accordingly. In particular, we employ the Tornqvist
approximation to the continuous Divisia price index

weight is in the first month after introduction, when data on

becomes

available; also, because of new goods, the summation over i in (2) and (3) is

to nt since a varies over time. Finally, once the log-changes are computed
using (2) and (3), we normalize the logarithm of the January 1984 observation
to zero, cumulate the log-changes in (2) over time, and then exponentiate;

this yields a Divisia price index normalized to unity in January 1984. The
results from this computation are presented in Table 3 in the row entitled
"New Goods Included -

Traditional".

A number of results merit comment.

First, as is seen in the row marked New Goods Included -

Traditional,

the AAGR of the Divisia index over the 1984-1989 time period is but 1.50%,
less than one third that for the Laspeyres index for X's Classified products
over the same time period (4.83% -- compare with the top row of Table 3, which

reproduces information from Table 2). Differences between these two indexes
could be due to the effects of varying index number formulae, shifting

weights, and the impacts of new goods. To isolate these effects, we first recompute the Laspeyres fixed weight index, but do not incorporate the effects

of re-sampling in the Cycle II survey beginning in 1988. Comparing the top
two rows in Table 3, we see that not resampling would have generated slightly
larger growth rates in 1988 and 1989, and that instead of being 4.83% over the
1984-1989 time period, the AAGR of the Laspeyres index with a fixed basket of
goods over the entire time period would have been 5.14%.
Next, to isolate the effects of shifting weights, we retain the same set
of goods used in the previous Laspeyres calculation (we fix the basket of
goods to that existing in January 1984), but we now employ the Tornqvist
approximation to the Divisia index (2) with traditional changing share weights

There it is seen that the effects of moving toshifting

weights and a traditional chained Divisia index are considerable, almost
halving the AAGR from 5.14% to 2.60% per year. with particularly sharp

differences occurring in 1984 and 1985. Clearly, allowing for changing shares
has a substantial impact - -

the

Laspeyres and traditional Divisia index

computed over the same basket of goods differ considerably. But this very
sharp difference, particularly in 1984 and 1985, raises another issue.
Within the index number literature it has been known for some time that.
based on a variety of theoretical criteria, chained indexes such as the
Tornqvist approximation to the Divisia are in most cases preferable to fixed

weight procedures. However, one potential theoretical problem with the chained
index is that of drift, a term coined by Ragnar Frisch [19361.

To understand the notion of drift, it is useful to envisage a chained
index between time periods 0 and t as the product of t price relatives, i.e.

—

(4)

Although the Tornqvist approximation to the Divisia has a number of desirable
theoretical properties, one important property it fails to satisfy is that of

circularity.17 Suppose, for example, that although prices within an aggregate
changed in periods 1 through t-1, all prices within the aggregate in period t
were the same as that in period 0; in such a case, the property of circularity

implies .hat the aggregate price index P should be the same as P0. It is
well-known that the chained Divisia index fails this circularity property, and
instead is subject to drift; an empirical example where circularity also fails
with a chained Laspeyres index is given in Bohdan Szulc [1983, pp. 540-5421.

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

-

PAGE 22 -

Szulc notes that for chained indexes, if the price of some particular
commodity "bounces" and the price and quantity of that good are strongly
negatively correlated, then the rapid transitory change in the weight employed
in the index number procedure can result in relatively permanent error or bias,

yielding an index that is suject to drift. Moreover, the earlier in the
sample that a price "bounce" occurs, the greater is the drift in the index over
time.

In our context, when we examined the BLS sample of Company X, we found
that the sharp drop in the 1984-1985 Divisia price index with traditional

weights could be traced to the sharp "bounce" of one commodity, whose price and

revenue are highly negatively correlated. Thus there is reason to be cautious
with the chained Divisia index, for it may well reflect drift, particularly
since the price bounce occurs near the beginning of the sample.

One way in which the adverse effects of drift in chained indexes can be
mitigated is to smooth the weights. In the spirit of extending the Tornqvist
approximation to the Divisia index but smoothing the share weights, one can
smooth the weights by employing a centered moving average share with a greater

length. Define a series of several new smoothed centered moving average

approximations to the Divisia index by replacing ij

We

have computed alternative Divisia prices indexes using these various

approximations)-8

Summary results from these calculations with new goods

excluded are presented in the middle panel of Table 3, and selected series are
reproduced in Figure III; detailed monthly series are given in Appendix III,
Table A-2.

One striking result seen in the middle panel of Table 3 is that the 198489 AAGR increases substantially when the shares are smoothed, regardless of the
length of the centered moving average; although the AACR based on the
traditional Divisia index is 2.60%, that obtained using 4, 6 and 12 month
moving average weights increases to 5.72%. 6.00%, and 5.67%, respectively.

Note that the relationship between the overall 1984-89 MGR and T is not
monotonic, although montonicity occurs in 1984.
Moreover, most of the smoothing is captured with relatively short moving

averages, say, when 4-month moving average revenue weights are employed. Thus,
stabilization of growth rates is attained quite quickly, and the effects of

drift are correspondingly mitigated. Price index movements for the Divisia
indexes with alternative smoothing weights are presented in Figure III; the
effects of drift are particularly visible, for the vertical distance between
traditional and moving average Divisia price indexes occurs at the beginning of
the sample, and tends to increase with time.

Having digressed briefly to consider effects of index number formulae and
the use of smoothed weights, let us now return to our attempt to isolate the

effects on AAGVs of introducing new goods from that of changing weights. Our
principal result so far is that when the basket of goods used in the index
number calculations is fixed, moving from the Laspeyres price index to a

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

Divisia

PACE 24 -

with smoothed weights increases the AAGR slightly from 5.14% to about

5.7%.

To isolate the effects of introducing new goods, we can compare various
smoothed Divisia indexes with new goods excluded to analogous ones with new

goods included.19 Using traditional weights, as is seen in Table 3 (and in
Figure IV), the impact of including new goods is initially very small in 1984,
it increases in 1985 and 1986, and becomes quite large in 1987 and 1988; over
the entire 1984-1989 time period, the difference between including and
excluding new goods is substantial, resulting in a decrease in the 1984-1989

AAGR from 2.60% to 1.50%.20 However, the effects of excluding new goods are
not nearly as large when 4-month smoothed weights are employed; with new goods
excluded, the 1984-89 AAGR with 4-month weights is 5.72%, while with new goods

included it falls about 22% to 444%•2l We conclude that how one introduces
new goods into the price index calculations has a significant empirical impact,
but that with this data to mitigate the effects of drift, using smoothed rather
than traditional weights in the Divisia index is even more critical.
It is also of interest to compute a price index confined only to new

goods. Divisia price indexes using traditional Tornqvist and 4-month moving
average weighting procedures are presented toward the bottom of Table 3 (and in
Figure IV).

There

it

is

seen that the aggregate price index of new goods

declines over time, having a 1984-1989 AAGR

of

-9.37% using traditional weights

and -8.78% with 4-month weights; moreover, the growth rates are negative in

every year except 1989.22 Interestingly, there is little difference here
between traditional and smoothed weights, unlike that for indexes based on

incumbent products at Company X. Apparently, for this sample of new goods
only, the negative correlation between price and revenue is not as strong as it
is with incumbent goods.

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

In

-

PACE 25 -

summary, while smoothing is important for computing Divisia indexes

with new goods excluded, the results based on new goods only are not affected

much by smoothing. Our preferred price indexes for the set of all classified
products, including new goods, is therefore the 4-month smoothed Divisia index
in the middle of Table 3, having a 1984-89 AACR of 4.44%.

As a final set of comparisons and check on the robustness of our
findings, we have also calculated Divisia indexes using traditional and
smoothed weighting procedures, limiting the products to those sampled by the

BLS at Company X. As is seen in the bottom panel of Table 3, with the
traditional Divisia weights, the 1984-89 AACR is but 2.62% (due to price
bouncing accompanied by negatively correlated revenues in 1984-1985, resulting
in drift), whereas with 4-month smoothed weights the AACR is a much larger
8.68%;23 rocall that AAGRs of the corresponding Divisia indexes for all

classified goods at Company X (including new goods) are 1.50% and 4.44%. Note
that the effects of smoothing are very large for this ELS sample, reflecting
perhaps the fact that the BLS sampled goods are relatively mature products,
whereas newer products in this sample do not require smoothing.
We conclude, therefore, that our finding that the sampling procedures
employed by the BLS do not yield an accurate portrayal of representative
transactions at Company X is robust to the use of various chained vs. fixed
weight price indexes, and to the manner in which new goods are introduced into
the price index.

In addition to doing price index calculations for the entire universe of
products at Company X, to all those classified into specific products, and for
goods classified as systemic anti-infectives, we have performed a number of
calculations based on other disaggregated product classes, to assess whether
the aggregate results masked considerable heterogeneity among distinct product

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHAR4ACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

classes.

-

PAGE 26 -

For reasons of confidentiality, we cannot provide details on such

calculations for each product class. What we can say is that the general
pattern reported for the entire set of Classified X products was also exhibited
in many, but not all of the detailed product class disaggregations; opposite
results obtained in several smaller classes. In this sense as well, therefore,
our findings are quite robust.

V.

M HYPOTHESIS ON THE SOURCE OF THE DISPARITY
Having established that price indexes based on the BLS sample of Company

X products appear to be substantially different from price indexes based on the
universe (or classified universe) of Company X's products (regardless of which
index number procedure is employed), we now attempt to provide evidence on
possible sources of this disparity.
The first hypothesis that comes to mind is that this difference simply
reflects the effects of random sampling; the sample taken from Company X just
happens to be somewhat different, but that is not surprising given the random

nature of probability sampling. At this point, we cannot pursue this
hypothesis further in a meaningful way, for any examination of it requires data
from more than one company, and such additional data are not yet available to

us. Note that in principle, it is of course possible that the sample of
products taken from Company X is based on a truly random sample.
However, we can take further advantage of our unique data base by
examining the particular products sampled by the BLS more closely, and perhaps

comparing them with the universe of X's products. Using specific product
identifier information for about £4O% of Company X's products (accounting for

over 93% of its revenues), we have computed the number of months since each

product was originally introduced24 This allows us to compare the age of

PAGE 27 -

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

products

sampled by the 81.5 at Company X, with the average age of the universe

of Company X's dated products. Our findings are presented in Table 4, and are
displayed graphically in Figures V and VI.

prevailing in 1984, the first year of our sample. For January 1988. we use
1987 revenue shares to be consistent with Cycle II survey timing.

In June 1981 when results from the 61.5 Cycle I survey were introduced,

the arithmetic (unweighted) mean of all dated products at Company X was 16.009
years, while that for the Cycle I products sampled by the 81.5 at X was 11.463

years. The sales-weighted means were slightly closer, however, being 11.606
years for all dated products at X compared with 7.131 years for the Cycle I
products sampled at X by the 8LS. Cycle I products sampled by the 81.5 were
therefore somewhat younger than the universe of Company X's products.
Matters changed considerably, however, by January 1988 when results frog

the SLS Cycle II survey were introduced. Although unweighted means for all of

-

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

PAGE 28 -

Company X's dated products were slightly larger than those sampled by the BLS

in Cycle II at Company X (19.956 vs. 18.907 years), the sales-weighted averages

differed sharply. In particular, the sales-weighted average of all of Company
X's dated products was 14.870 years, whereas the sales-weighted average of the

products sampled by the BLS at X was much larger, 18.294 years. Had there been
no new products introduced at X, had no exits occurred, and had all products
retained their market shares from 1981 to 1988, the sales-weighted average
would have increased with time -

-a

total of 6.417 years from June 1981. to

January 1988. In fact, however, the sales-weig)tted average of products sampled
by the BLS at Company X increased 11.163 years --

from 7.131 years at the

beginning of Cycle I (June 1981) to 18.294 years at the beginning of Cycle II

(January 1988). This suggests that unlike the case during Cycle I, in Cycle II
the ELS sample covers products that on average are more mature and further
along in the product life cycle than is representative of Company X's product
transactions 25
Althougb the above evidence is suggestive, our analysis has revealed what

we believe is a more convincing piece of evidence. Specifically, if the Cycle
II set of products was based on probability sampling, then one would expect
that the set of products sampled in Cycle II would likely be rather different

from that Set of products sampled in Cycle I. However, the data reveal that
50% of the specific products at Company X in the ELS sample during Cycle I were
again chosen for sampling by the S1.S in Cycle II. Our impression is that the
probability of this occurring when probability sampling is in fact being
employed is very, very small, particularly since half of the products retained
from Cycle I to Cycle II each accounted for less than 0.25% of Company X's VOS.
The share of all re-sampled products as a proportion of revenues of all
products at Company X in the Cycle II sample in 1987 is about 50%, and the

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARAACEtJTICAL PREPARATIONS

-

PAGE 29 -

revenue share of all Cycle II sampled products in total Company X revenues in
1987 is about 25%; these numbers do not change much from comparable figures for
the Cycle I products in 1984.

It is worth noting that there are good reasons why one might want to
continue resampling the same set of products, in order to provide comparability

over time. But it must also be emphasized that this re-sampling of a large
proportion of the same products in Cycles I and II is very likely to be
inconsistent with probability sampling procedures that are proportional to VOS.

Finally, at this point we can only conjecture why this peculiar pattern

of product re-sampling by the BLS occurred at Company X. Like other government
statistical agencies, the BLS has been under stringent financial budgetary
conditions for some time, and it is well-known that initiation surveys and

product disaggregation procedures are costly to implement. Moreover, relations
between BLS field representatives and company officials can easily become
strained when monthly time series on detailed product-specific price and

quantity data are requested. Given budget constraints and costly, perhaps
unpleasant interviewing procedures, it simply may have been convenient for BLS
field representatives to keep a substantial proportion of the same products in
the samples constituting Cycles I and II.

VI.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Our purpose in this paper has been to compare price indexes constructed

in a variety of ways from the universe of products of a large multiproduct
pharmaceutical manufacturer in the US, with price indexes constructed from the
particular products of this firm sampled by the BLS, using BLS and alternative

index number procedures. We have found a rather substantial disparity in that,
employing monthly data from January 1984 through December 1989. the BLS sample

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

-

PAGE 30 -

index rises at almost twice the rate of indexes based on the universe of

price

products manufactured and shipped by this pharmaceutical firm. In contrast.
the LS sample index from Company X rises similarly to SIC 2834 price indexes
published by the BLS.

We have also examined possible sources of this disparity, and have

explored one hypothesis. Our preliminary result here is that the choice of
products sampled by the BLS in Cycle II overlaps considerably those chosen in

Cycle I, a result that is possible but rather unlikely to occur were
probability-based sampling procedures followed in practice. We are also struck
by the fact that the sales-weighted average age of products included at the

beginning
products

of the Cycle I
sold

survey (June 1981) was somewhat younger than all dated

by Company X (7.131 vs. 11.606 years), but that in the Cycle II

sample of Company X

beginning in

about 40% greater than a

January 1988 the sales-weighted average was

sales-weighted average

of all of Company X's dated

products at that time (18.294 vs. 14.870 years). Hence from Cycle I to Cycle
II, a major shift has occurred in the age distribution of products sampled by
the BLS

relative

to those sold by Company X.

A second major set of findings concerned the "new goods" problem. Our

results suggest that the

manner in which new goods are introduced into price

index calculations has a substantial empirical impact, in our case, reducing

the

rate of growth of the price

index. However, our empirical results based on

the traditional Tornqvist approximation to the Divisia index suggested that
this index was subject to drift, consistent with the theoretical result that

this

chained index does not satisfy the circularity property. Using

alternative

we

centered moving average weights

to approximate the Divisia index,

discovered that in our data base, coincidentally, accounting for drift

almost offsets the effects of introducing new goods more rapidly.

In fact, the

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARI(jiCEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

PAGE 31 -

1984-1989 AAGR of the Laspeyres index spliced in 1988 over all classified goods
at Company X was 4.83%. while that based on a 4-month weighted moving average
was 4.44%.

This research suggests a number of important issues that should be

pursued. First, since the pharmaceutical preparations industry is rather
unconcentrated, there is a clear possibility that data from Company X, one of
the twenty largest firms in the industry, are simply quite different from that

of other firms and are iot representative of the industry as a whole. The
fact that growth in the CPI for this industry's products iL similar to that of

the PPI is perplexing. It is worth noting that anecdotal evidence on price
index comparisons provided us by officials at another large pharmaceutical

manufacturer are consistent with results reported here. Nonetheless, without
further data, we cannot rule out the possibility that Company X is simply an
outlier, and that the CPI and PPI adequately portray transactions in this

industry's products. Therefore, since the plural of anecdotes is data, we are
currently exploring possibilities of obtaining and then processing confidential
data from one or more additional companies, or from an industry-wide data
gathering company.

Second, although we have presented results on the new goods problem and
have also found evidence suggesting the presence of drift with Divisia indexes,
these issues are very important and clearly merit much additional attention.

Third, due to delays in obtaining appropriate data, we have not yet been
able to undertake a thorough comparison of list vs. transactions prices.

However, since Company X reported list rather than transactions prices to the
BLS for its sampled products, we have been able to compare list and
transactions prices for a small set of products, although even here the record

is incomplete. Based on a preliminary analysis of this data, we have found for

PRICE INDEXES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS

-

PAGE 32 -

those products sampled in both Cycles I and II, overall AAGRs of list and
transactions prices are very sicuilar, but for products observed only in short

periods within Cycle I or Cycle II, list prices have grown more rapidly than

transactions prices. In all cases, however, list prices change less frequently
than transactions prices.

Fourth and finally, we have Ignored entirely the issue of accounting for

quality change. In future research, we plan to assess the possibility of
employing laboratory test data on the efficacy of certain pharmaceutical
preparations in hedonic price regression equations, and the usefulness of such
hedonic price equations in computing quality-adjusted price indexes.26

2Some products were deleted from or added to this list during the 1984-89 time
period.
3Note that the summation counter is not specified in (1), and generally
requires an additional subscript. Also, the BLS Handbook (BLS, Bulletin 2285
(1988), p. 130) states that "The expression Qa) represents the weight in
value forii, and the P and Q elements (both of which originally relate to
period "a" but are adjusted for price change to period "0") are not derive.i

eparate1y."
41n U. S. Department of Labor [undated, b, p. 2), it is stated that "The quote
allocation scheme for pharmaceuticals assigned sixteen quotes to the twentysix largest sample units (in terms of employment), ten quotes to the twentyfive next largest companies and six quotes to the remaining establishments.
This allocation scheme was based on the number of quotes needed for
publication purposes, balanced against the possible affects [sic) of
overburdening the respondents."

51n U. S. Department of Labor [undated, a], it is stated that "For specified
companies, both cancer therapy and diabetes preparation drugs are being
certainty selected."
6Djscuss ions with ELS personnel indicate that in some cases where value of
shipment data is intact and complete for establishments, VOS rather than UI
data are used to compute probabilities of inclusion.

7As Hill (1987. p. 583) notes, "By law, every employer in the U.S. is required
to report the number of people employed and to purchase insurance which will
cover the employer's unemployment benefit liability. As a result the UI file
data are fairly complete. The continued existence of the UI file is also
assured, thereby ensuring continued availability of a consistent frame for
sampling. The UI file contains such information as the establishment's name,
the SIC in which it is classified, the county and state in which it is
located, and its number of employees. This file is explicitly stratified
according to industry classification and thus provides individual industry
frames which form the basis for the PPI frames."

10Random numbers are presented on the bottoms of pages in the forms filled out
by BLS field representatives.

11However, there is some ambiguity here. Although the wording in the BLS
discussion of special disaggregation procedures (U. S. Department of Labor
[l986a, undated a]) explicitly states that the entire cell is discarded once
the certainty selection occurs, our sample from Company X contains multiple
selections from individual cells.
12An adjustment is made for inter- and intra-industry transfers to remove nonfinal product values from the weights, thereby obtaining net output values of

Input-Output tables from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, U. S. Department of
Commerce.

14The 1982 Herfindahl-Hirschman index for the 50 largest companies is 312.
These data are taken from U. S. Department of Commerce[1982, Table 6, P. 71011.

15The Consumer Price Index for prescription preparations shows a very similar
price trend as the PP]. Annual growth rates for 1984 through 1989 are
8.40%, 9.02%, 8.08%, 7.98% and 7.84%; the AACR over the entire 72-month time
period is 8.75%.
161n particular, to mimic the BLS procedures, we employ equal weighting within
cells, and Census value weights between cells, the latter provided us by
personnel at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Office of Prices and Living
Conditions.

empirical illustrations, see, inter pita, W. Erwin Diewert (1988]. Charles R.

observations, we
for up to the first (T/2 + 1) and down to the last 4T/2 fixed the share weights (5) - (7) at the T T and ij t-T values,
respectively.

I)

191n each case, new goods are introduced as soon as is possible, i.e. they
enter in the second month they are present. Specifically, for weights from
time periods for which data are not observable, we inflate the observable
weights to make them comparable to T, if only two months of weights are
observable and T — 4, we double values of the observed weights.
share of post-1984 new goods in total Company X revenues was less than
1% in 1984 and 1985, but by 1989 this share increased to around 35%.

21To conserve on space, results from 6 and 12-month smoothing are not
presented. The 1984.89 AAGR with 6 month smoothing is 4.42%, while that for
12 is 4.12%.
22Using 6 and 12-month weighting procedures, the 1984-89 AAGR are -10.30% and
-10.52%.

23Wben 6 and 12-month weights are used, the 1984-89 AACR is 10.20% and 8.88%,
respectively.
24Alternative presentations of the same product are all treated as being
introduced at the time the initial presentation was brought to market.
25Preiiminary calculations relating the real price of a product to its age
(defined as years since the presentation of the product was first sold)
suggest that real price declines typically occur in the first five years of a
product's life at Company X, price increases occur until about age 12, it

until about age 16, and then rises with age. The price decline after
age 12 might reflect the effects of patent expiration, whereas the subsequent
price increase may be due to survivor bias and inelastic demand.
