This strategy would not

be appropriatefor our purposes, since we want to cnnsldr the influence
of both market- and transactrun-related

variables on prcce determination.

We did, however, examine the robustness of our estimates (in Table 5) of
the effects of transaction—related

variables

by using fixed msrket

effects instead sf our measurs oi market concentratconon the buyer and

seller sides.

The fixed effects reflected the patterns predicted by the

market structure variables, and the Coefficient estimates on the firm and
transactionvariables of interest were srmilsr to those reported in Table
52.

The results reported in Table

I

are robust to estimation over the

full set of 1424 contracts.

This is probably more isportant for prodncers

than for pipelines,

who have better informaticn abnct downstream demand conditions.

Indeed,

when we include only produ er vnlnscu and buyer total contracts, the sane
pattern emerges.
