RIDD ThE YIEW aJRVE: REFiISE

We

investigate the efficacy of riding the yield curve. This strategy

dictates holding longer-term treasury bills when the yield curve is upward-

sloping. We find that the strategy is surprisingly effective. it
stochastically dominates buying and holding shorter-term bills for large

subperiods, and nearly dominates for the entire sample period, 1949 — 1988.
Our empirical results suggest that abnormal profit opportunities are
available from selectively increasing the maturity of a short-term
portfolio.

RIDING THE YIELD CURVE: REPRISE

Riding the yield curve is a strategy of
bills when the yield curve is

buying longer-dated

upward-sloping and selling them prior

to maturity in the hope or expectation of

collecting any term

premium that may exist. For example, three
for the next 30 days would be: (1)

ways of holding money

buy a 30-day bill and allow it

to mature; (2) buy a 60-day bill and sell it as a 30-day bill 30
days hence; or (3) buy a 90—day bill and sell

it as a 60-day bill 30

days hence. Choices (2) and (3) are "riding the yield curve."
While the practitioner literature

rise by just enough to equalize holding period returns on all

bills. Alternatively, if there is a risk—related term premium,
riding the yield curve should simultaneously

increase both risk and

return. In principle, this strategy ought not improve the
risk-reward profile (nor should any costless_to_compute rule enhance

performance). Righer-sloped yield curves ought to reflect some
combination of increasing expected interest rates and increased
interest—rate risk.
Nevertheless, Dyl and Joehnic (1981) provide positive evidence

on the efficacy of riding the yield curve. Using data for the

1970-75 period, they find that (1) riding the yield curve gives a
small boost to average return without an appreciable increase in
risk relative to buying and holding shorter-term bills, (2) that
longer-dated bills are better than shorter-dated bills at

providing

those returns, and (3) that a simple filter rule can enhance the

risk-reward profile of the riding strategy. The filter allows one
to ride the yield curve only when the curve has a positive slope

greater than some critical threshold. These results

suggest a

useful trading rule, but in view of the extremely short sample

period, must be considered only indicative. Since the Dyl and
Joehnk study, more extensive data sets have become available, and
allow for more definitive testing.
In this paper, we utilize a recently available data set to
examine the efficacy of riding the yield curve for the period

1949—1988. Our data also provide evidence of abnormal profit
opportunities. Riding the yield curve at some maturities appears to
increase average returns with no appreciable increase in risk. The

yield pickup, moreover, is well in excess of transaction costs. Our
most striking result is that in several

subperiods (e.g., the past

10 years or the past 20 years) the sample distribution of returns
from riding the yield curve stochastical].y dominates the

distribution from the buy—and-hold

strategy. Although the full

1949-1988 sample does not quite yield stochastic dominance, a
relative risk aversion parameter exceeding 260 would be necessary
for an investor to prefer the buy-and-hold short-term bill

distribution to that of the ride. In contrast, estimates in

2

financial research place the typical investors risk aversion
parameter below 2.0. (See for example, Friend and Blume (1974) or
Bodie, Kane, and Marcus (1989).)

In Section 1 of this paper, we

briefly discuss our data and

their reliability. In Section 2 we explain and motivate the
rules to be tested. Section 3

In Section 4, we Conclude

and discuss the implications of our results.

aggregated into zero-coupon yields, which in turn gave zero—coupon

prices. Therefore, while their prices are not taken from direct
observations of zero—coupon securities,

they are consistent with

prices that were (for the most part) available for transactions.

These data differ from Dyl and

Joehnk, who collected bid and

ask prices from the fl Street Journpl once a week on the 26
regular T-bill issues outstanding. From that rich data set, they
were able to compute

holding period returns for several

alternative strategies. In addition, because those prices were
effective until noon the next day, their results reflect
transactions that could have been executed.

Although one Obviously would prefer to use firm dealer quotes
to simulate trading strategies, Coleman et al. report that it is no

3

longer possible to gather Treasury prices which necessarily reflect

transaction possibilities. As of 1980, interest rates had become so
volatile that the dealer quotation sheets used by CRSP

contained

only indicative prices on Treasury securities instead of available

transaction prices. Therefore, it would be impossible to replicate
exactly Dyl and Joehnk's research beyond 1979. Moreover, Coleman,
Fisher, and Ibbotson (1987) found that the ask prices supplied to

CRSP became unreliable after 1979.2 Therefore,

their zero-coupon

prices are based on the average of bid and ask prices through 1979
and bid prices alone thereafter.

(for example, by use of only bid prices), returns will not be
affected since the return on a

zero—coupon security is measured by

P1/P0, implying that numerator and denominator bias will cancel in

the calculation of returns.3 While random price errors can cause
biases in returns via a Jensen's Inequality effect, we show in the

equates the holding period returns on the buy-and-hold and riding

Joehnk filter). We consider rides on 6-month, 9-month,
12-month maturity bills.

and

Transaction Costs
Before proceeding, however, we note that the riding strategy
entails greater transaction costs than the buy-and-hold strategy,
since the longer-term bills must be sold at the bid price at the

end of the holding period. The bid-ask spread on 3-month bills
(where we will focus most of our attention) is virtually

always

below 6 basis points on a discount basis. Assuming that the
"true' bill price is midway between bid and ask prices, the
annualized transaction cost to a seller would be 3 basis

points.

Because maturity is one—fourth of a year, the cost is 0.75

of a

basis point when the bill is sold after the 3-month holding

period. Therefore, we reduce the calculated return each quarter
on the riding strategy by 0.75 of a basis point in months that a
ride occurs to account for incremental trading costs.
(Transaction costs between 0.80 and 3.25 basis points

are

considered below.)

3. RSULTS
Table 1 presents evidence on the efficacy of the MOS filter

for a 3—month holding period. For each MOS (-1, 0, 0.025),

we

present in the panels labeled frequency" the fraction of quarters
in each subperiod in which riding the yield curve was pursued and
in the panels labeled "success" the percentage of those rides that
turned out to be profitable (i.e., provided returns in excess of

buy-and-hold). For exaniple, referring to the 1984-1988 panel, we

7

see that with an MOS of 0, the investor would have ridden the

yield in 85 percent of the quarters in this 5-year period. Of
these rides, 65 percent would have resulted in returns in excess
of buying and holding 3-month bills, meaning 35 percent would have
resulted in opportunity losses relative to the buy-and-hold
strategy.

The screen seems at best weakly effective. While fewer rides
are pursued as the filter becomes more stringent, the success rate

of the rides pursued does not uniformly increase. For example,
looking at the bottom panel for the full period, the frequency of
riding 6—month bills falls from 100 percent to 69 percent as the

MOS rises from -1.0 to 0.025. The frequency of success increases
somewhat from 66 percent to 71 percent as MOS rises to 0, but then
falls back to 70 percent when MOS increases to 0.025.
Table 2 presents a different measure of the efficacy of

riding the curve. The top entry in each panel is the increment to
the average rate of return for the particular subperiod that
riding the yield curve provides over the buy-and-hold strategy.
The bottom entry is the increment to the standard deviation of

holding period returns. All entries are in units of percent per
quarter. The table shows that riding the yield ':urve generally
increases both average return and intra—period vclatility. Of
more interest is the fact that average return is increased in

almost all five-year periods. The 6—month ride shows higher
average returns in all periods. This result suggests that riding

8

the yield curve might be a beneficial strategy for investors

with

long horizons but with a desire to invest in the money market, for

example, investors placing portions of their retirement savings in

money-market accounts. The Dyl and Joehnk screen does not appear
to provide risk-free added value.5 The screen usually lowers
average return as well as risk, as it filters out progressively
more rides on the curve.

Tables 1 and 2 do not, in themselves, indicate any abnormal

performance from riding the yield curve. Indeed, they are broadly
consistent with a standard risk-return tradeoff. However a more
revealing view of riding the yield curve is provided in Figures 1

and 2. In Figure 1 we plot the cumulative sample distributions of
full sample 3-month buy-and—hold returns and returns from riding
the yield curve using 6-month maturity bills, a zero margin of

safety, and 0.75 basis point transaction costs. Despite the
higher volatility of the riding strategy. Figure 1 shows that the
returns from riding whenever the yield curve slopes upward (MOS

=

0) nearly stochastically dominates the buy-and-hold strategy. In
fact, the riding distribution would stochastically dominate6 the

buy-and-hold distribution except for the presence of the single
negative return to riding (which occurred in 1958, second

quarter). The two lines cross near the (0,0) point.
Figure 2 presents sample return distributions again with MOS
=

0, 3-month holding periods, rides using 6-month maturity bills

and transaction costs of 0.75 basis points for the most recent

9

20-year subperiod 1969-1988. Stochastic dominance by the riding
strategy in this period is complete.
The 6-month rides using MOS of 0.025 also stochastically
dominated the buy-and-hold strategy except for the one crossover

in 1958. Because of the similarity of results, the figure is not

presented. The always-ride strategy (MOS =

-1.0)

did not fare as

well. There were several cross-overs in the sample return
distributions. Rides using maturities other than 6 months are
considered below.
Of course, we know a priori that the true population
distribution of returns to riding cannot stochastically dominate
that of buying and holding, because only the riding strategy poses

a possibility of negative returns. Nevertheless, the dominance of
ridings sample distribution over such extended periods of time
encompassing different interest—rate regimes is striking, and is
highly suggestive of historically abnormal returns to the riding

strategy. Certainly for these substantial subperiods, riding has
provided abnormal risk-adjusted returns.
It also is worth acknowledging again that these results must
be interpreted in the context of an investment horizon.

For a

three-month horizon, the three-month bill is riskless, and it
makes no sense to talk about the probability distribution of its

returns. However, a long-horizon investor who compares the
alternative strategies of rolling three-month versus six-month
bills each quarter would be interested in the empirical results

10

presented in the Figures. as these would definitively recornnend
the riding strategy.

Although the returns distribution over the entire 1949-1988
period do not exhibit stochastic dominance, riding the yield curve
still has offered risk-return attributes far superior to the

buy-and-hold alternative. An investor with a constant relative
risk-aversion utility function would need a risk-aversion
parameter exceeding 260 before he or she would avoid riding
6-month bills (with a zero margin of safety) in favor of buying

and holding. In contrast, the mean excess return and volatility
of the S&P 500 index over Treasury bills have been consistent with
a risk-aversion parameter of about two.7
These results may be sensitive to the assumed level of

transaction costs. To measure the historic advantage of the
6-month riding strategy over buy-and-hold, we calculate the

relative risk aversion parameter for which the tw strategies are
equally attractive under other assumptions for transaction costs.
Table 3 presents the risk aversion parameter which equates the

expected utility of each strategy for several levels of
transaction costs in excess of the already—posited 0.75 basis
point per quarter (which corresponds to a reported bid-ask spread

of 6.0 basis points). Expected utility is computed using the
sample distribution of returns to each strategy over the full
1949—1988 sample period.

11

tJtility falls off rapidly with transaction costs. However,

increasing transaction costs by 2.5 basis points from the assumed
value of 0.75 basis points (consistent with a bid-ask spread on
three—month bills of 26 basis points!) still leaves riding the

yield curve as a preferable strategy for risk aversion

coefficients below 10. Thus, it appears that fot any reasonable
specification of risk aversion and transaction costs, riding the
yield curve using 6-month bills presents a return distribution

superior to that of buying and holding three-month bills. If
transaction costs are about 0.75 basis points, as we have argued,
then riding the yield curve has provided abnormal risk-adjusted
returns in excess of 2.5 basis points per quarter or 10 basis

points per year. (Gross return differences——not adjusted for
risk—- were closer to 10 basis points per quarter. See Table 2,
bottom panel, which shows average incremental returns per quarter
over the whole sample.)

MOS filters above zero would have destroyed value instead of

creating value. We see this by comparing columns MOS =
MOS = 0.025 in Table 3.

For every level of transactions costs in

Rides using longer maturities than six months did not perform

as well as the six-month rides. Figure 3 for example, provides
full-sample distributions for nine-month rides versus buy-and-hold

distributions for MOS of 0.0. While longer—term riding
distributions also lie generally to the right of the buy—and-hold
distribution, when riding longer-maturity bills fails, as in 1958
second quarter, long-term riding fares much more poorly than the

6—month ride because duration is higher, giving rise to a longer

left-hand tail. These results, together with Table 2, suggest
that the extra average return to riding beyond maturities of six

months increases risk by too much to qualify as a dominant
strategy.

Finally, we ask whether riding the yield curve is an
effective strategy for holding periods other than three months.
In Figure 4, we present return distributions for 6—month

buy-and-hold versus 6-month rollovers of 12-month bills for MOS of

0.0. Clearly, the riding strategy is not dominant.

4. CONCLUSION
We have found that riding the yield curve using six-month
maturity zeros has been an extraordinarily effective strategy

versus rolling over three-month zeros. Riding the yield curve
using longer maturity bills for three-month holding periods also
outperforms the simple buy-and-hold strategy, but does not
incrementally enhance performance versus use of the 6-month

bills. In fact, such longer rides perform slightly worse due to

13

increased interest-rate risk. Similarly, riding the yield curve
using 12-month bills and 6-month holding periods does not offer a
risk-reward profile arguably better than that obtainable from
buying and holding 6-month bills.

These results are suggestive of some market segmentation for
maturities on either side of 3 months, in that it appears that
profitable trading strategies straddling this maturity have gone

unexploited. Possibly, maturities less than 3 months are viewed
as more liquid and better cash substitutes than longer maturity
instruments, even beyond a simple duration effect. In this case,
the apparent abnormal performance of longer maturity bills may be

viewed as the price of this liquidity attribute. However, this
interpretation suggests that modelling prices as solely a function
of risk and return attributes is too narrow a view of the market.

The actual rate of return, r, realized by a trader is
defined by 1 +

r

=

P1/P0, where P0 denotes the price at which the

zero—coupon security is purchased, and i is the price at which it
is sold. We, however, measure prices with error, in part because
of unobserved bid—ask spreads, and in part because of statistical

error in the fitting of the yield curve. We therefore measure r

with error. If r* is the measured return, then

it is clear that measurement error in P1 will not bias returns as
long as e1 and e0 are independent, since in this case the second

term in (A.2) has zero expectation. However, the first term will
not provide an unbiased estimate of 1 +

r.

To see this, expand

the first term around P0 in a second-order Taylor series:

Thus, returns will be biased upward by the square of the standard
deviation of measurement error expressed as a fraction of the
security price.

This bias, however, should be exceedingly small. As noted
above, the bid-ask spread is less than 6 basis points annualized,

or 3 basis points on a 6-month bill. Moreover, Coleman et al.
(1989, Table 10—3) present standard errors of their
cross—sectional forward rate curves for each maturity class.
Their results imply that for maturities less than one year, the
standard error of the implied bill prices is in most cross

sections considerably less than 0.25 percent. Together, these
data imply that the total value of (e0) would be less than 30

basis points, or 0.3 percent of price. If a typical 6-month
return is 3 percent, the bias would be determined by

E(l +

implying a negligible bias of 0.09 basis points. Even if the
standard deviation of the measurement error in price is 0.50

be small, only 0.26 basis points:

FOOTNOTES

Coleman et al. assume that forward rates are constant over
certain time intervals and then use a nonlinear least
squares technique to find the sequence of forward rates

that best fit the prices of all Treasury securities. They
obtain their best fit for short—term securities by allowing
the forward rates to change with maturity fairly frequently

at the short end of the term structure. In fact, the first
five weeks are fit exactly, because they allow different

forward rates for each of the first five weeks. The time
interval over which the forward rate is assumed constant is
short for all maturities less than one year, which means
that the inferred prices should be quite accurate for the

securities we examine in this paper. The exact scheme for
inferring forward rates is as follows:

They report that whereas bid prices for T-bills reported in
the Wall Street Jouriiai. and CRSP are always close (they

differ slightly because the former is a 3:00 pm price and
the latter is a closing price), the ask prices in CRSP and

the Journal vary widely. Because the bid prices are
consistent while the ask prices in CRSP imply bid-ask
spreads as high as $2.00, Coleman, at al. chose to use only
bid prices from CRSP for dates after 1979.
3.

The returns on investnents held to maturity will be biased
upward by the use of a bid price since in this case, the
numerator in the return calculation is exactly par value
(rather than a calculated quantity) while the denominator

is downward biased. However, this property only
strengthens our empirical conclusions below, in that we
find that riding the yield curve dominates the buy and hold
strategy even with the upward bias in buy and hold returns.
4.

Strictly speaking, these are not three-month T-bills, but
three-month zero-coupon bonds priced based on the Treasury

yield curve. However, for expositional ease, we will
continue to refer to them as bills.
5.

Because these filter rules worked for Dyl and Joehnk, we
would like to compare our results to theirs for the sample

period in which our data overlap. This, however, is not
possible. Our data set contains zero—coupon prices at
maturities of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Our rides must

19

therefore be at 3-month increments. In contrast, Dyl and
Joehnk have bills with maturities staggered each week.
Their rides generally involve very small increments to the
maturity of the bill being held, and most of their tables
present returns from overlapping periods averaged across
rides of different maturities.
6.

One investment stochastically dominates another if the
cumulative probability distribution of its returns lies

strictly to the right of the others. This means that the
dominating investment has a higher probability than the

dominated investment of beating any target return. All
risk—averse investors will prefer the investment with the
dominant distribution in a pairwise comparison (see
Ingersoll, 1987).
7.

We follow Bodie, Kane, and Marcus (1989). The historical
average risk premium and standard deviation in the market
portfolio have been about 8.5 percent and 21 percent

respectively. In an CAPM-type model, where all investors
hold the market portfolio, the risk premium should equal
AcTM2 where A is the risk aversion parameter and aM2 is the

market variance. These values imply that A =
1.93.
