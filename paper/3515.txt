Using data from the United Nations Comparison Project and the Penn
World Table, we find that machinery and equipment investment has a strong
association with growth: over l9&)—l95 each percent of GDP invested in
equipment is associated with an increase in GDP growth of 1/3 a percentage
point per year. This is a much stronger association than found between growth

and any of the other components of investment. A variety of considerations
suggest that this association is causal, that higher equipment investment drives
faster growth, and that the social return to equipment investment in wellfunctioning market economies is on the order of 30 percent per year.

Introduction

It is no accident that the era in which European economic growth took
off is called the Industrial Revolution. Blanqui [18371, first to use the
phrase in print, identified its beginnings in the invention and spread of those
"two machines, henceforth immortal, the steam engine and the cottonspinning [water frame]." Ever since, qualitative historical discussions of
growth have emphasized the role of machinery investment in augmenting
labor power. Landes' [1969] statement that "the machine is at the heart of
the new economic civilization" is typical of accounts that have assigned a
central role to mechanization. Technology embodied in machinery has been,
as Mokyr [1990] says, "the lever of riches."
Yet at least until recently modern quantitative studies of economic
growth have tended to downplay the role of mechanization. Work in the
aggregated growth accounting tradition of Solow [1957], Denison [1967],
and Abramovitz [1956] has typically concluded that capital accumulation
accounts for only a relatively small fraction of productivity growth in
individual countries, or of differences across countries.1 The assumption
underlying growth accounting calculations that capital is paid its marginal
product, coupled with observed profit rates, implies that increasing the rate
of capital accumulation can make only a modest contribution to increasing
growth in net product. Even a doubling of the U.S. net private investment
rate would, according to standard estimates, raise the growth rate of real
income by less than half a percentage point per year.
This paper provides quantitative evidence in support of the older,
traditional view that the accumulation of machinery is a prime determinant
'More disaggregated growth accounting studies like those of Jorgenson [1988]. which consider
different types of capital and draw a distinction between capital stocks and capital services, have
typically found a larger role for accumulation in accounting for growth in some countries. We discuss
the relationship between our findings and those of more disaggregated growth accounting studies in
the conclusion.

of national rates of productivity growth, and against the supposition that the
private return to equipment investment mirrors its social product. Using
data on the components of investment drawn from the United Nations
International Comparison Project (U.N. ICP) (see Kravis, Heston, and
Summers [1982] and United Nations [1985]) and Summers and Heston
[1988, 1990], we demonstrate a clear, strong and robust statistical
relationship between national rates of machinery and equipment investment
and productivity growth. Equipment investment has far more explanatory
power for national rates of productivity growth than other components of
investment, and outperforms many other variables included in cross-country
equations accounting for growth High rates of equipment investment can,
for example, account for nearly all of Japan's extraordinary growth
performance.
Timing evidence, consideration of alternative sources of variation in
equipment investment, the behavior of equipment prices, and the differing
association of equipment investment with intensive and extensive growth all
suggest that this association is causal, with higher equipment investment
driving faster economic growth. We interpret our results as suggesting that
the social return to equipment investment in well-functioning market
economies is on the order of thirty percent per year.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II motivates our emphasis
on equipment investment and presents information on equipment prices and
quantities for our sample of countries. Section III presents the basic results
linking equipment investment and productivity growth. It also explores
their robustness along a number of dimensions including variations in
sample period, the sample of countries, the inclusion of additional
determinants of growth, various interactions, and alternative measures of
equipment investment.
Section IV addresses the issue of causality in the relationship between
equipment investment and growth. The pattern of equipment prices supports
the claim that fast-growing countries are those with favorable supply

Investnent and Growth

conditions for producers' equipment, not those where some third factor has
accelerated growth and shifted the demand curve for producers' equipment
outward. Section IV also examines the timing of the relationship between
equipment investment and growth, the effects of alternative sources of
variation in equipment investment on productivity growth, and the
differential association of equipment investment with that part of GDP
growth generated by rising productivity and that part generated by an
increasing labor force. Section V concludes by discussing the relationship
between our results and previous arguments suggesting the unimportance of
capital formation, and considering the normative implications of our
findings.

II. Equipment Investment and Economic Structure
A. Equipment Investment and Economic Development

There are at least three grounds for suspecting that equipment
investment may have higher social returns than other forms of investment.2
First, as we have already noted, historical accounts of economic growth
invariably assign a central role to mechanization. Economic historians have
seen the richest countries as those that were first in inventing and applying
capital intensive technologies, in which machines embody the most
advanced technological knowledge (see, for example, Usher [1920], Landes
[1969], and Pollard [1982]). The history of economic growth is often
written as if nations and industries either seized the opportunity to intensify
their specialization in manufactures and grew rapidly, or failed to seize such
opportunities and stagnated (as in Rostow [1958] or Gerschenkron [1962]).
2Jorgenson's [1988] work highlights that equipment investment will have a larger short-run effect on
growth in gross product than other torms of invesmient because of equipment's higher depreciation
rate even if private and social returns to different forms of investment are equalized. In the long run,
however. equipment's higher depreciation rate leads it to have a smaller effect on growth. We discuss
these issues in the conclusion.

Investnent and Grou'tli

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

Second, discussions of economic growth in the development
economics (like Hirschman [1958] or Chenery eta!. [1986]) and the new
growth theory traditions (like Romer [1986]) stress external economies or
"linkages" as causes of growth. Spillovers may well be larger in some
sectors than others. Manufacturing accounts for ninety-five percent of
private-sector research and development in America, and within
manufacturing the equipment sector accounts for more than half of research
and development according to Summers [1990]. Hence, it is plausible that
equipment investment will give rise to especially important external
economies.
Third, it is often alleged that a number of countries have succeeded in
growing rapidly by pursuing a government-led "developmental state"
approach to development. The rationale for this policy is that countries
which adopt the price and quantity structure of more affluent nations are
more likely to grow than those that possess the structure of poorer countries.
The government should jump-start the industrialization process by
transforming economic structure faster than private entrepreneurs would.3
As we discuss below, rates of equipment investment tend to increase and
their price tends to fall as productivity rises. If the developmental state
approach is correct, countries investing more heavily in and enjoying lower
equipment prices should enjoy more rapid growth.
B. Measuring Equipment Investment
Data on the share of nominal national product devoted to equipment
have long been available from national income accounts data. However,
these data do not permit an accurate assessment of the impact of equipment
investment on growth unless the relative price of equipment is constant
across countries. The availability of data from the U.N. ICP, described in
Kravis, Heston and Summers [1982], provides information on the relative
prices of many components of GNP at a disaggregated level for a large
3Works taking this point of view include Cohen ind Zysman 19871 and Johnson 119821.

sample of countries for individual snapshot" years. It is therefore possible
to study in a cross section of nations the relationship between investment
components and growth.
The ICP collects data on three components of producers' durable
investment—producers' transportation equipment, electrical machinery, and
non-electrical machinery. In an earlier draft of this paper (De Long and
Summers [1990]) we investigated the relationship between total producers'
durable investment—the sum of these three components—and productivity
growth. In carrying out the research reported here, we realized there was
little information in the producers' transportation component of durables,
and so in this paper we focus primarily on an equipment aggregate
comprising electrical and non-electrical machinery. With the benefit of
hindsight the exclusion of producers' transportation equipment can perhaps
be justified by arguing that much variation in rates of transportation
investment reflects differences in the "need" for transportation caused by
differences in urbanization and population density.

C. Economic Structures and GDP per Worker Levels
The most extensive ICP data on equipment investment comes from the
Phase IV 1980 survey which covers more than sixty countries.4 Figures I
and 11 plot, respectively, our estimates of the real price of equipment
relative to the GDP deflator in 1980 and of the average 1960—85 share of
GDP devoted to equipment investment against 1980 GDP per worker for
those nations in our sample in ICP Phase IV. We draw three principal
conclusions.

Relative 1980 GOP per Worker

First, variations in relative prices of equipment are large, and so

measures of the share of nominal national product devoted to equipment
investment are likely to be misleading guides to real magnitudes. As
4Kravis, Heston. and Summers 11982! report ICP Phase Ill estimates of relative price and quantity
structures in 1975 for sixty percent of the Phase IV countries. We merge the 1975 Phase 1H and 1980
Phase IV snapshots of price and quantity structures with the l960—85 long-run growth data of Penn
World Table V (see Summers and Heston 119901): we have adjusted the ICP estimates using
revisions of published ICP data kindly provided by Robert Summers.
We also omit high-income oil exporting countries from our regressions. Our total sample
consists of sixty-one countries. Appendix IV presents the data series used in our regressions.

productivity levels increase, there is a tendency for the relative price of
equipment to fall. An increase of 10 percentage points in a country's
income relative to the United States is associated with an 8 percent fall in its
machinery price relative to the GDP deflator.5 This would generate a
positive relationship between the real equipment share and productivity
even if there were no correlation between productivity and the nominal
share of equipment. Beyond the relationship between equipment prices and
productivity, there are sizeable differences in the cost and quantity of
equipment investment between countries at similar levels of development.
Second, as Figure II shows, there are wide variations in national rates
of equipment investment as a share of GDP. Wealthier nations tend to have
higher equipment investment shares: those nations with 1980 GDP per
worker levels less than ten percent of the U.S. have equipment shares,
calculated in the "international dollar" measure of Summers and Heston,
that average 3.5 percent of GDP; those nations with 1980 GDP per worker
levels greater than seventy percent of the U.S. have equipment shares
averaging 8.2 percent of GDP. The cross section variation at given
productivity levels is also substantial. Equipment investment shares in
countries such as Chile and Venezuela are some five percentage points
lower than would be expected given GDP per worker. Equipment
investment shares in countries such as Israel, Japan, and Finland are five
percentage points higher than expected.
Third, poorer nations possess very large relative variances in their
equipment prices and quantities. Those nations with GDP per worker levels
above eighty percent of the U.S. level have a standard deviation of
producers' durables prices about the simple regression line of ten percent;
those nations with GDP per worker levels below twenty percent of the U.S.
level have a standard deviation of more than fifty percent. Some, perhaps
5A similar relationship holds over Lime: the fastest growing countries are also those that have
experienced the steepest declines in relative real machinery prices. See De Long and Summers

[1990].

much, of this variation in prices and quantities at the low end of the
productivity scale is measurement error. Much of the remainder may reflect
differences in the character of investment in very poor countries. For
example, Zambian investment is concentrated in copper mining and copperbased manufacturing, which employ five percent of its labor force and
where average labor productivity is forty times average labor productivity in
agriculture; relatively small equipment investments in the copper sector will
loom large in the economy as a whole, yet it is difficult to believe that this
sector has significant linkages with the rest of the economy (see Young
[1973] and Bates [1976, 1981]).
We are thus skeptical of what can be learned by combining in one
regression very poor countries, which appear to have productivity levels less
than those enjoyed in the United States before the industrial revolution,6
with technologically-sophisticated developed countries. We therefore
focus heavily on a sample of countries with relatively high productivity
levels: those countries with GDP per worker levels greater than 25 percent
of the U.S. level in 1960.
Before analyzing the relationship between equipment investment and
economic growth in the next section, we pause to highlight the fact that
international patterns of equipment differ from patterns of non-equipment
investment. In our sample, equipment investment averages 28 percent of
total investment, but the composition of investment varies widely. Figure III
plots the 1980 price of equipment investment against the investment
deflator. Figure IV plots our estimate of equipment investment over 1960—
1985 against other investment as a share of GDP. The correlations are
weak—0.203 for the prices, 0.427 for the quantity shares in our sample. In
the case of prices, this should not be too surprising, for equipment is
tradeable while structures—the other major component of investment—are
6According to Summers and Heston. the U.S. today has a real GDP per worker level 14 times that of
Zambia. According to Kuznets 11971]. U.S. re,il GDP per worker increased by a factor of 8 between
1870 and the present. and perhaps slightly less than doubled over the previous century.

The fact that equipment's share in total investment varies so widely,

and the centrality of machinery in historical discussions of growth suggest
the importance of disaggregating investment in considering its relation to
economic growth. If machinery and structures contribute differently to
growth, then analyses of the relationship between total capital accumulation
and growth are likely to be very misleading. Likewise, the use of an
investment price deviation from a "normal" level as a proxy for the extent
of distortions in an economy, as in Barro [1990], appears implausible given
that structures are not traded and that the investment deflator depends
heavily on the price of structures and on the composition of investment.

HI.

Equipment and Growth

This section demonstrates that nations which invested heavily in

equipment relative to other nations at the same stage of economic
development enjoyed rapid growth over 1960—1985. Our measure of
economic growth is the growth rate of GDP per worker, measured in
international dollars, as reported by Summers and Heston [1990]. In
evaluating the contribution of equipment investment to growth, we hold
constant labor force growth rates, the share of GDP devoted to nonequipment investment, and the level of GDP per worker. For the most part,
we rely on the inclusion of the initial GDP per worker gap in the regressions
to control for any systematic causal relationship running from the level of
GDP per worker to the level of equipment investment. We also experiment
with using a gap variable from the middle of the sample, as recommended
by Romer [1989].
A. Basic Results
Figure V, and equation 1 beneath it, report our basic results obtained
using the high productivity sample of the 25 nations with 1960 levels of
GDP per worker greater than 25 percent of the U.S. level. Figure VI reports

orthogonal to 1960—1985 labor force growth, to the average 1960—1985 real
non-equipment investment share of GDP, and to the 1960 relative GDP per
worker gap vis-a-vis the United States against that component of the 1960—
85 real equipment investment share of GDP orthogonal to the same three
variables. That is, it provides a partial scatter of equipment investment and

productivity growth.

While the standard deviation of growth rates in our sample is 1 .32

illustrated in figure V is only 0.80 percent. Including the equipment variable
reduces the variance of the residual by 47 percent compared to a similar

strong support for the proposition that equipment investment is more closely

The regression line of equation I implies that an increase of 3

percentage points (one standard deviation) in the share of GDP devoted to
equipment investment leads to an increase in the growth of GDP per worker
of 1.02 percent per year, which cumulates to a 29 percent difference over
the 25 years of the sample. This means, for example, that differences in
equipment investment account for essentially all of the extraordinary growth
performance of Japan relative to the sample as a whole. Conditional on the
initial GDP per worker gap and the achieved rates of growth of the labor
force, Japan has achieved a relative GDP per worker growth rate edge of 2.2
percent per year over 1960—1985 relative to the average of the high
productivity sample, and five percent per year relative to Argentina. In both
cases, more than four-fifths of this difference is accounted for by Japan's

high quantity of equipment investment.8
The shift to a larger sample in Figure VI does not materially affect the
coefficient of the equipment quantity variable. We performed Chow tests to
see if the same structure holds for countries with 1960 GDP per worker
levels greater than and less than 25 percent of the U.S. and failed to reject
the null hypothesis of a common structure of regression coefficients.9

B. Statistical Issues
The regression lines depicted in Figures V and VI and equations 1 and
1' were obtained using OLS. We verified that the standard errors were not
appreciably affected by allowing for conditional heteroscedasticity. A more
significant issue is spatial correlation.1° If neighboring nations have similar
values for significant omitted variables, the data will contain less
information than the reported standard errors suggest. In a sense, country
pairs like Norway and Sweden or Argentina and Uruguay seem a priori not
two observations but more nearly one single observation—we would not
feel that we had lost information if we had data not on Belgium and the
Netherlands separately but on the Benelux aggregate instead.
However, when we examined the pattern of the residuals from the
high productivity sample we found to our surprise no sign of spatial
8Japanese growth performance was extraordinary even before the post-World War H period. High
equipment quantities and low prices characterized its economy far back into history. The argument
that abnormally low equipment prices have had a strong impact on growth in Japan by significantly
increasing the returns to saving is made by Dc Bever and Williamson 11978]. who note abnormally
low producers' durable prices in Japan and suggest... that this unique relative price behavior has its
source in the technological dynamics of Japan's capital goods industry... (and] deserves far more
attention than Japanese analysts have given it so far. An argument that Japan has achieved high
growth by concentrating investment in equipment rather than structures is made in Pattick and
Rosovsky 119761.
9We always reject the null hypothesis that the residual variances are the same across the 25 percent
of 1960 U.S. GDP per worker divide. Non-parametric tests do reject the hypothesis of a common
structure of regression coefficients.

'°See Case 119871.

correlation. We regressed the product uiuj of the regression residuals for all
country pairs on the distance between the capitals of country i and country j.
We expected to find that the product of the residuals would tend to be high
when countries had capitals that were close together. We did not: for a
variety of specifications the estimated dependence of uiuj on distance was

statistically insignificant and substantively unimportant. We report some of
our results on spatial correlation in an appendix.
We also examined sensitivity to outliers by dropping each of the
observations in turn. There are no individual observations that, when
omitted, change the equipment investment coefficient by as much as ten
percent in the sample of the 25 high-income nations.11
The most significant statistical issue is that the equations reported here
are not the first equations we have estimated. Our earlier work explored
various price variables in more detail, and also examined an equipment

aggregate that included transportation equipment, unlike the aggregate used
here. We thus choose the current set of specifications partially on empirical
rather than a priori grounds.
Since finishing the bulk of the empirical work for this paper, we have
obtained data on equipment quantities for five additional countries.12
Adding these five points to our basic regression raises the coefficient on
equipment investment by an insignificant amount. When data from later
versions of the ICP become available for a larger number of new countries,
it will be possible to further check the validity of the estimates we present
using a sample not available when the estimates were generated.

11Hong Kong is the most influential observation, having a very high growth rate given its equipment
investment share. In the larger sample of 61 countries, Botswana and Zambia are influential outliers,
as we discuss below.

C. Sample Selection Issues
There are two important dimensions of sample selection involved in
figure V and equation 1—the choice of countries included in the analysis,
and the choice of a sample period. These issues are addressed in Table I. It
considers the 1970—1985, the 1975—1985, and the 1960—1975 periods as
well as the 1960—1985 period as a whole. The results for the equipment
investment variable are not sensitive to the choice of a sample period.
Table I also compares the results obtained using the high productivity
sample of countries with 1960 GDP per worker greater than 25 percent of
the U.S. level with results obtained using the larger 61 country sample, and
with results obtained using the 61 country sample while controlling for
various educational and political correlates of growth as in Barro [1990a.13
If differences in the reduced-form laws of motion followed by rich and poor
countries spring from poor countries' lack of the human and political
infrastructures necessary to take advantage of modern technologies and to
make fixed capital-intensive investments in technologies secure, including
variables such as literacy and education rates should improve the power of
regressions on the larger sample.14 The additional variables do contribute
modestly to the explanatory power of the regressions, but do not have an
appreciable impact on the equipment coefficients. For the entire 1960—1985
period, our results suggest that a twenty five percentage point increase in
both primary and secondary education rates has the same partial association
with growth as a one percentage point rise in the equipment investment
share of national product. Table I also explores the effect of replacing the
initial 1960 GDP per worker gap relative to the U.S. with the 1975, midsample period gap.15 This replacement has no material effect on the
equipment investment coefficient.
13The coefficients on the correlates favored by Barro I 1990al are reported in Appendix II.
14The additional political and human capital correlates would have little effect in the high
productivity sample because they do not vary much among developed countries.

Results using the entire 61 nation sample are somewhat sensitive to
outliers. The exclusion of Zambia, for example, raises the adjusted R2 in the
regression underlying figure VI from 0.29 to 0.44; the exclusion of
Botswana would reduce the adjusted R2 from 0.29 to 0.21. Inclusion or
exclusion of these two countries can move the equipment share coefficient
between 0.21 and 0.31, although the coefficient remains significant at
conventional levels.
Although the larger 61 nation sample is significantly affected by
outliers, it is worth pointing out that it omits two outlier nations with large
identifying variances that would significantly strengthen our findings.
Singapore and Taiwan have both had high equipment quantities, low
equipment prices, and rapid productivity growth in the post-World War II
period. Neither Singapore nor Taiwan is in our sample. Singapore
surrendered and regained its independence during our sample period. The
existence of Taiwan is not recognized by international organizations. The
inclusion of these two observations would strengthen our conclusions.16
D. Additional Growth Determinants

It is natural to wonder whether the quantity of equipment is proxying
for some other well-known determinant of growth omitted from our list of
independent variables. Table II reports the results of adding variables
measuring (i) the share of manufacturing in value added, (ii) the importance
of public investment, (iii) the real exchange rate in 1980,17 and (iv) the
continent to our basic specifications. The only case in which the inclusion of
an additional variable has a material impact on the coefficient of equipment
161t is also worth pointing out that omitting the equipment investment share variable from the
regression does not materially raise the coefficient on the other investment share. With equipment
investment omitted, the other investment share has a coefficient of 0.029 for the high productivity
sample and 0.105 for the larger sample: with other investment omitted, the equipment share has a

coefficient m the two samples of 0.332 and 0.300. respectively.
17Since the real exchange rate is significantly related to current GDP per capita. our independent
variable is the residual from a regression of the log 1980 real exchange rate on GDP per capita.

The lack of effect of continent dummies in the larger sample is
perhaps worth a further note. Much of the identifying variance in our
regressions does come from a comparison of East Asia to South America,
but there is substantial variation within continents as well. Considering
islands and peninsulas along the coast of Asia, Hong Kong, Japan, and
Korea have low equipment prices, high equipment quantities, and rapid
growth while Sri Lanka and the Philippines have high equipment prices,
low quantities, and slow growth. Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay are poorlyperforming South American nations, but Brazil has performed well. In
Africa, Senegal, Madagascar, and Zambia have performed badly, but the
Ivory Coast, Botswana, and Tunisia have all grown relatively rapidly.
The high productivity sample lacks these within-continent contrasts.
The high productivity sample contains the United States, Canada, fastgrowing Asians, slow-growing Latin Americans, and many intermediate
European nations. Within Latin America the association between growth
and equipment investment is strong. Within Europe it is not. And there are
many more European than Latin American data points in the sample.
A great deal of attention has been devoted in recent years to the
relationship between pricing distortions—particularly protection—and
growth. The 1987 World Development Report has provided perhaps the
most powerful statement of the case that relative economic success or
failure is to a significant degree a function of the government's willingness
to see its industry compete with foreign producers for the domestic market
on a level playing field. Unfortunately, quantitative measures of the
importance of protectionist barriers are not available, and the qualitative
measures available do not match the sample of countries that we have used.
Table LII examines the relationship between growth and equipment
investment holding constant measures of the incidence of distortions.
Measures of distortions are drawn from Luca Barbone's (1988) assessment
of OECD openness using residuals from a modified gravity trade model;

Investment and Growth

2

I

Fri. Oct 5, 1990

from Jones' estimates of national effective protection rates, as summarized
in the zero-one dummy variable for countries with effective protection rates
above 40 percent used in Barro {l990bJ; from "business leaders"
perceptions of the business climate as reported in a collection of survey
evidence, the World Competitiveness Report; from the work of Agarwala
reported in the 1983 World Development Report, and from World Bank
assessments of the "outward" orientation of trade policy as reported in the
1987 World Development Report.
While many of the measures of trade orientation and distortions we
use suffer from being the subjective judgments of analysts who also know
about growth outcomes, we nevertheless prefer them to the use of trade
shares which we regard as relatively uninformative.18 Trade share measures
to a large degree pick up difference in national size and proximity to trading
partners. Suppose, for example, that Belgium and Holland merged. Would
the resulting entity be—in any interesting sense—less open and able to
exploit economies of scale than either country was previously?
The World Competitiveness Report surveyed business leaders around
the world, asking them to assess governmental policies and economic
environments in eighteen OECD and eight developing nations. We take
three "openness" variables from the World Competitiveness Report:
businessmen's assessments from the survey of the extent to which the
government's exchange rate policy is oriented toward keeping its industries
competitive exporters, the extent to which inward trade is free, and the
extent to which trade legislation supports businessmen who wish to export
as opposed to those who fear competition from imports.

In the World Competitiveness Report sample, none of the three
variables enters our growth equation significantly, and inclusion of each of
the three does not materially affect the coefficient on equipment quantities.
The failure of the World Competitiveness Report "openness" variables to
reduce the coefficient on equipment investment gives us some confidence
that equipment investment is not simply a proxy for distortions that work
against the interests of exporters. These two sets of "openness" variables
have the substantial virtue of not having been constructed in the context of
studies advocating free trade.
Regressions using the Barbone openness estimates for OECD
countries give no signs that our equipment variables are proxies for
openness or trade-reducing distortions. The residuals from his modified
gravity model are ineffective as an independent variable in our growth
equation. And the coefficient of the equipment quantity variable is
unaffected. Regressions using the Jones high effective protection rate
dummy variable show that in both the larger and high productivity samples
inclusion of the variable reduces the equipment investment coefficient by
1/4, and that nations with a high effective protection rate see economic
growth lower by a significant 1.1 percent per year.
The Agarwala sample is not a favorable one for our basic regressions.
It contains a set of poor nations for which our specifications work relatively
badly, and for which the data are least reliable. In the Agarwala sample our
basic equipment share regressions produce a coefficient half as large, with a
standard error three times as large, as in our basic specification.
Nevertheless, five of the six Agarwala measures increase the equipment
coefficient when they are included in the regression. Only the exchange rate
distortion index appears to pick up a significant part of the equipment
investment share variable.
The World Bank sample is also a poor one for our basic specification
—producing an equipment share coefficient of 0.242 with a standard error

Investment and Grotih

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

24

of 0.183. The World Bank's "outward orientation" measure enters the
regression significantly—the more outward oriented, the faster growth—
and halves the equipment coefficient when included. The World Bank's
trade orientation measure does capture a significant fraction of the factors
captured by our equipment variable, in much the same way as the Agarwala
exchange rate distortion variable does; the coefficient on the equipment
share is reduced by about half.

We are not sure how to interpret this association between the World
Bank's outward orientation measure and our equipment investment
measures. Korea, for example, which the World Bank treats as strongly
outward oriented, has not attained its outward orientation by keeping
relative prices free, but has sought instead to promote and heavily subsidize
heavy and export industry.19 It may well be that promoting equipment
investment and spurring export growth go hand in hand.2°
E. Components of Invest,nent
Table IV reports results using different disaggregations of investment.
When producers' transportation equipment is considered separately from
the "other investment" aggregate, its coefficient is large—albeit imprecisely
estimated—for the high productivity sample when the initial 1960 GDP per
worker gap is used as a control. When the mid-sample GDP per worker gap
is used, or when the larger 61 country sample is considered, producers'
transportation equipment has a much weaker relationship to growth than
either electrical machinery or non-electrical equipment.
Our decision to consider as our primary "equipment" measure the
aggregate of electrical and non-electrical machinery excluding producers'
durable transportation equipment is open to question. The fifth line of each
panel of table IV contains the finest disaggregation of investment. In the
high productivity sample, electrical and non-electrical machinery each help
to forecast growth when the other is in the regression; structures and

19See Collins and Park [19871. The 1987 World Development Report both holds Korea up as one ofa
very few examples of "strongly outward oriented" nations and critiques its governments for having
interfered heavily in relative prices and so reduced growth rates.
20TabIe V below presents some regressions suggesting that this may indeed be the case and that
equipment investment and the World Development Report outward orientation measures are strong

complements. However, equipment investment and a low Jones effective protection rate measure
appear to be. if anything. substitutes.

machinery are the only components with t-statistics greater than one and
positive signs, and it is not possible to reject the null that their coefficient
are the same. We do not believe that any of our substantive results depend
on the exclusion of producers' transportation equipment from our
equipment aggregate, or on the grouping of electrical and non-electrical
machinery.21
We suspect that attempting to refine the analysis and estimate different

effects on growth of the different components of equipment pushes beyond
the information that the data reliably contain. Our exploration of the
separate effects on growth of electrical machinery and non-electrical
equipment produced somewhat puzzling results. On the one hand, as table
4 shows the quantity of electric machinery has a more potent impact on
growth than the non-electric machinery component. On the other hand, we
have found that electrical machinery prices are less related to growth than
non-electrical equipment prices—the fastest growing nations are those that

have the lowest non-electrical equipment prices, not the lowest electrical
machinery prices.22 We therefore settle on our "equipment" variable.
F. Interaction Terms

It is possible that the marginal impact of equipment investment differs

systematically with the rate of equipment investment or with the values of
other potential independent variables. Romer [1989], in his discussion of
the determinants of growth, places great emphasis on evidence using total
investment that the apparent marginal product of investment declines as
nations grow richer and increases as their export share increases.

21 many industries electrical machinery and non-electrical machinery are very strong
complements; efficient production requires both.
22We report some of the disaggregated relative investment price regressions we have performed in

Table V adds quadratic equipment terms and the interactions between
investment and the initial GDP gap, the WDR openness rating, and the Jones
effective protection rate (EPR) dummy from Barro [1990bJ to our basic
specifications. The results are, unfortunately, inconclusive. There is some

Int'est,nent alul Gro%'t/l

28

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

evidence in the high productivity sample that the impact of additional
investment on growth declines with the initial GDP per worker level,
though the result fails to be statistically significant when the 1960 GDP per
worker gap is used (although substantively it is very significant). There is
also some evidence for decreasing returns to equipment investment. The
(investment)2 term is substantively significant for the high productivity
sample.
But the patterns found in the high productivity sample are not robust
to sample expansion. In the larger sample the interaction of GDP per worker
and equipment investment is statistically and substantively insignificant.
Moreover, the interaction of equipment investment with itself changes sign
in our basic specification. We find very attractive the idea that a high social
product of equipment investment reflects technology transfer mediated
through capital goods, and thus that the social product is higher for poorer
countries with more of a technology gap to bridge. But the data do not
speak reliably enough on this point for us to be willing to do more than
point out that the question is intriguing and potentially very important, and
the evidence not conclusive.
The interaction of a high Jones effective protection rate dummy
variable from Barro [1990b} and equipment investment similarly produces
different patterns in the two samples. And in the high productivity sample, it
appears that it is strongly protectionist, not open countries that benefit most
from equipment investment.
This does not fit the fact that the interaction of equipment investment
and the WDR trade orientation, for those developing nations with available
data, is significant and important: the most outward oriented nations appear
to be those that benefit the most from an increase in the equipment
investment share. It is necessary to be both outward oriented and to have a
high equipment investment share in order to achieve rapid growth. And the
estimated coefficients imply that the most inward oriented nations would
not benefit at all from increased equipment investment. High rates of

Investment and Growth

29

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

equipment investment appear to complement, not substitute for an outward
orientation as the World Developtnent Report defines it. It is somewhat
puzzling that they do not also appear to complement a low effective rate of
protection.

IV. Does Equipment Investment Cause Productivity Growth?
The relationship between equipment investment quantities and
economic growth appears relatively robust, in that equipment investment
does not appear to be proxying for some other widely recognized
determinant of growth. This section takes up the question of whether the
relationship between equipment investment and growth is causal.
One reason to believe that equipment investment causes growth, rather
than that growth causes investment, is that if growth caused investment we
would expect to see similar associations between equipment and structures
investment and growth. Rapid economic growth certainly raises the quasirents earned by investments in equipment to establish and entrench market
positions, but it also raises the rents earned by structures. Favorably located
land is in fixed supply and larger structures economize on the use of such
land, and so one might imagine that faster economic growth would tend to
shift the use of savings away from producers' equipment and toward
structures. Yet it is equipment, not investment and not structures, that is
associated with rapid growth in our sample.
In this section we provide additional evidence against the hypothesis
that equipment investment and growth are both driven by some third
variable—that the same favorable conditions that raise productivity growth
might also encourage equipment investment without equipment investment
playing an essential direct role—in four further steps. First, we examine the
association between equipment investment and the components of GDP
growth driven by productivity growth and labor force growth; we find a

Investment and Groiih

30

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

much closer relationship between productivity growth and equipment
investment than between productivity growth and labor force growth; this is
hard to reconcile with a viewpoint that holds that increasing GDP drives
equipment investment. Second, we consider timing evidence. Third, we
consider the joint behavior of equipment prices and quantities; we regard
this as the strongest of the pieces of evidence—fast growth goes with high
quantities and low prices of equipment investment, and this is not easy to
reconcile with the belief that the high quantity of equipment investment in
rapidly growing countries is due to some other factor that has both caused
fast growth and shifted the demand curve for equipment investment
outward. Fourth, we consider the effects of alternative instruments for the
equipment quantity variable; if the association between growth and
investment were due to some additional factor causing both, it would be
surprising if that additional factor were closely associated with all of the
different instruments we use.
A. Equipment Investment and the Components of Total GDP Growth
If the association between equipment investment and growth arose
from some sort of accelerator mechanism, and equipment investment was a
consequence and not a cause of growth, one would expect both increases in
productivity and increases in the labor force to lead to increased equipment
investment. Table VI reports regressions, for both the high productivity and
the larger samples, with equipment investment on the left hand side and
with the two different components of GDP growth—the rate of growth of
GDP per worker, and the rate of growth of the labor force—on the right
hand side as well as our standard control variables of the 1960 GDP per
worker gap and the share of GDP devoted to other types of investment.
Table VI shows that equipment investment is strongly positively associated
with increases in GDP that come from increasing productivity, and
negatively associated with increases in GDP that come from increasing the
labor force holding productivity constant. The t-statistic on the difference

Iin'estment and Growth

31

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

between the productivity growth and the labor force coefficients is more
than 3 for the larger sample and more than 5 for the high productivity
sample.

Table VI is thus an additional piece of evidence against the claim that

our results arise because rapid growth leads naturally to rapid investment
through an accelrator mechanism. Rapid total GDP growth driven by
increasing productivity is closely associated with high equipment
investment. Rapid total GDP growth driven by an increasing labor force is
not. It is hard to reconcile this differential association of equipment
investment with intensive and extensive growth without invoking a causal
role for equipment investment in producing productivity growth.
B. Timing

If some unobserved attribute—perhaps national culture, or the
structure of institutions—causes rapid productivity growth, there is the
possibility that it would also induce an increase in equipment investment.
In this case the association and equipment investment and growth would be
driven by some deeper country-specific attribute. If such an attribute is
persistent, a plausible proxy would be past growth rates. Table VII
therefore adds growth over the 1960-1975 period to equations relating
1975-1985 growth to equipment for both our high productivity and full
samples. The inclusion of past growth does not add much explanatory

Investment and Growth

power. The impact of equipment investment on growth is only marginally

affected.

Table VII also replaces current equipment investment with an estimate
of the lagged investment share over 1960—1975 in the list of the
determinants of 1975—1985 growth. if high investment is a consequence and
not a cause of growth, it is hard to imagine how lagged investment could be

Investment and Groit'th

33

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

a better proxy for unobserved determinants of growth than lagged growth
itself. Lagged equipment investment is estimated by multiplying the total
investment share over 1960—1975 by ICP observations of the equipment
share of investment. This lagged equipment variable has strong predictive
power in the high productivity sample, and weak predictive power in the
larger sample. It has strong predictive power in the high productivity sample
even with 1960-1975 growth also included.23
C. Equipment Prices and Growth
Figures VII and VIII plot the component of the equipment price

orthogonal to GDP per worker24 to growth rates, partialing out labor
growth, relative prices of other investment, and initial productivity for both
the full and high productivity samples. There is a strong negative
association between equipment prices and growth. We see the association of
growth with high quantities and low prices of equipment as strong evidence
that equipment investment drives growth. If high rates of investment were a
consequence rather than a cause of growth, one would expect that because
of strong demand the price of equipment would be high in rapidly growing
countries.

23We have also attempted to estimate fixed-effects models relating changes in equipment investment
rates to changes in growth rates without success. Our failure might be due to an errors-in-variables
problem arising from our lack of direct data on the equipment proportion of investment before 1975
for most countries.

24The "orthogonalized" equipment price used as the independent variable is the residual from log
real relative equipment price regressed on GDP per capita relative to the United States, measured in
international dollars. For nations covered in both the 1975 and 1980 ICP phases. the two observations
are averaged to obtain an estimate of the characteristic relative price structure in the post-World War

II period. Since equipment prices are markedly lower in richer countries, it is important to consider
only that portion of relative prices orthoQonal to the country level of GDP per worker. If we used
the unadjusted and not the orthogonalized' equipment price in a reiression, ii would be close to
including the end of sample period level of GDP per worker as an independent variable. Since the
beginning of sample period level of GDP per worker has already been included as an independent
variable, such a regression would come close to reproducine the identity that change
final - initial.

Orthogonal Component of Producers' Equipment Price

Fast growth would shift demand to the right, and move the economy
upward and outward along the equipment supply curve. Instead, growth is
associated with a move down and to the right in an equipment price-

investment and Growth

35

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

quantity graph, suggesting that supply is shifting out in high-growth
countries and moving the economy along the equipment demand curve.25
The relationship between equipment prices and growth is explored in
more detail in Table VIII, which reports equations relating equipment prices
and growth for both our samples. The relationship between equipment
prices and growth is almost as robust as the relation between quantities and
growth for the high productivity sample. It is less robust for the larger 61
nation sample. Many African countries, including Ethiopia, Madagascar,
Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, and Zambia, report low real producers' equipment
prices, and yet have exhibited disappointing long run productivity growth
rates.
In large part, low equipment prices operate to promote growth by
increasing the quantity of equipment investment. As Table IX shows, when
equipment investment is included in the productivity equation the
coefficient on equipment prices declines, and is never both significant and
negative. This bears on the "liberalization" hypothesis discussed above. If
high equipment investment's large coefficient in a growth regression arose
because it proxied for the presence of a laissez faire attitude towards trade,
one would expect the equipment price variable, a 1irect measurement of
distortions, to be a more important determinant of growth than the
equipment quantity.

D. Alternative Sources of Vuiriation in Equipment investment
The evidence in the previous subsection suggested that low equipment
prices are associated with rapid subsequent productivity growth, and that the
mechanism through which the association operates is high rates of
equipment investment; we now consider various sources of variation in
equipment investment, and their impact on productivity growth. More
25The association between low prices and growth does not arise because high investment makes it
possible to take advantage of economies of scale in production. A high fraction of equipment—30
percent—is imported even in the United States. In Colombia. 80 percent of equipment is imported.

Investment and Grmi'i/i

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

36

generally, an assertion that differences in equipment investment cause

differences in productivity growth is a claim that changes in equipment
investment, however engineered, will influence growth. The next best thing
to direct experimental evidence is to examine whether different sources of
variation in equipment have similar impacts on growth. To do this, we
instrument equipment investment with a number of alternative variables and
check whether its estimated impact changes. This procedure can be viewed
as an informal Hausman-Wu test of the proposition that equipment
investment can be treated as an exogenous variable.

For both the high productivity and full samples, Table X reports OLS

estimates of the relation between equipment investment and growth, along
with estimates obtained by instrumenting with equipment prices, with rates
of national saving, and with measures of trade liberalization. The results for
the high-productivity sample are supportive of a causal relation between
equipment investment and growth. The coefficient using either prices or the
national saving rate as an instrument is close to that obtained using OLS.
Using World Competitiveness Report survey measures of trade orientation

as an instrument yields an imprecise estimate of the impact of equipment on
growth, lower by six percentage points than the OLS estimate in the high
productivity sample.
The results for the larger sample are almost as strong. Instrumenting
equipment with its price or with the WCR survey variables yields results
that are similar to the OLS results, although the WCR-instrumented
coefficient is once again imprecise. However, the coefficient turns negative
(with an enormous standard error) in the full sample when national saving
rates are used as an instrument.26
Five out of six regressions produce no material difference when the
equipment investment coefficient is estimated by instrumental variables
rather than by ordinary least squares. It is easy to construct arguments that
the instruments used here are endogenous. This makes the similarity of the
estimates obtained with different instruments to each other and to the OLS
estimates more surprising. The different components of variation in
equipment investment associated with equipment prices, with the nominal
savings rate, and with the WCR variables all have the same association with
the rate of growth. Such similarity would be a remarkable coincidence
unless the association between equipment investment and growth is the
result of structural causation running from equipment to growth.

V.

Implications and Conclusions

We think that this paper makes a persuasive case for a strong

association between equipment investment and growth. The relationship
between rates of equipment investment and growth is very different from
the relationship between structures investment and growth. It accounts for a
substantial part of the variation in rates of growth. While there are a few

given the importance of net capital inflows.

Int'estinent and Growth

anomalies, we suspect that the results are very robust by the standards of
research on cross-country growth. Tests of robustness performed here have
been more extensive than in other efforts—for example, Romer [198911—to
draw conclusions about investment-growth correlations. Given the small
number of observations, the large number of independent variables, and the
poor quality of much data underlying the larger sample regressions,
anomalies are inevitable. What is of interest is not that some specifications
do not support our interpretation, but that many do.
A. Comparisons with Other Work
Our findings raise a number of questions. First, can they be
reconciled with earlier research, especially research downplaying the role of
capital accumulation? Research in the growth accounting tradition has
assumed away the possibility of external effects from accumulation. But
studies which took a more catholic viewpoint have also tended to downplay
links between accumulation and growth. Dowrick and Nguyen [19891, for
example, analyzed a sample close to our high productivity sample, yet
found a coefficient of growth on the total investment share of only 0.12 or
so.

We believe that many previous studies have been carried out at an
inappropriate level of aggregation. We see no reason to expect that
investments in structures should carry with them the same external effects
as plausibly attach to investments in equipment. We are not aware of
previous work that has separated the components of aggregate investment
and studied their differential impacts on growth in a cross section of nations.
Given the clear differences in the composition of investment depicted in
Figure IV, it is not surprising that studies that have focused on total capital
accumulation have understated the potential contribution of investment to
growth.
One series of studies that has led to conclusions qualitatively similar
to ours is the research project of Jorgenson [1988, 1990]. Jorgenson

investment and Growth

41

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

estimates sectoral production functions and uses them for sophisticated and
highly disaggregated growth accounting exercises. He finds substantial
complementarity between equipment investment on the one hand and total
factor productivity growth on the other. In most industries technological
change is capital using: at given prices, isoquants with higher levels of total
factor productivity lead to higher ratios of capital to labor (a point made for
the nineteenth century by David [1977]).
Jorgenson thus finds a larger role for equipment investment in
supporting productivity growth than is found in growth accounting work
using aggregate production functions. The relative shares of industries differ
across countries and since the magnitude of the capital using bias in total
factor productivity growth may well not be independent of the level of
productivity. Qualitatively, however, his stress on the importance of
disaggregation in measuring capital inputs is the same as ours.

B. Equipment Investment and Aggregate Production Functions
Before seeking explanations involving external economies for our
findings, it is important to ask whether they can be reconciled with the
presence of a standard neoclassical aggregate production function and the
restriction that capital is paid its marginal product. In neoclassical models
steady-state growth rates are independent of investment rates. However,
investment rates may influence growth rates as shifts in investment rates
cause economies to transit between steady-state growth paths. Moreover,
since equipment and structures have different depreciation rates, the
neoclassical model predicts that with equal net private rates of return there
will nevertheless be differences in the relationship between shifts in
investment shares and shifts in the rate of growth of gross output including
depreciation. This is the essential point behind Jorgenson's distinction
between the stock of capital and the flow of capital services.
To evaluate the potential magnitude of these effects, we calculated the
effects of increased equipment and structures investment on growth in GDP

Investment and Grov't/i

and NDP, over short and long runs. For simplicity, we assumed an
aggregate net product production function with the form of:
(2)

Y = (K +K )aLlce
a
eq

We begin the economy in steady state growth with the rate of growth
of the effective labor force (n + g) equal to two percent per year, with the
initial shares of GDP devoted to equipment and structures investment at 7.5
percent each, and with the rate of depreciation on structures equal to 2
percent per year. We consider capital shares (a) of 40 and 60 percent, and
we consider depreciation rates on equipment (seq) of 15 and 25 percent. For
these various sets of parameter values, Table Xl reports the marginal impact
on growth rates in percentage points per year of a one percentage point shift
in the GDP share of equipment or structures investment.

Two clear conclusions emerge. First, within the aggregate production

function framework it is not possible to account for an association between
investment and output growth of the magnitude suggested by the empirical
cross-country results. Even assuming a capital share of 60 percent, a CobbDouglas production function produces a long-run effect of equipment

Investment and Grot'th

43

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

investment on growth little more than half as large as our empirical
estimates support. Allowing for a lower elasticity of substitution in
production would reinforce this conclusion. So would recognizing that
differences in investment rates are persistent and that nations' capital/output
ratios had already diverged by 1960 because of differential previous
investment shares.
Second, the simulations illustrate that in the long run neoclassical
models predict that increases in the share of output devoted to gross
structures investment rather than equipment investment should have the
most potent effect on growth. The effect of a once and for all shift Meq in
the equipment investment share asymptotically changes the equipment
capital/output ratio by:

similarly for a shift in structures investment. Because structures have a
lower depreciation rate, adding to structures investment ultimately raises
capital intensity and therefore gross output more than adding to equipment
investment. A given increase in structures investmen1 corresponds, in the
long run, to a larger increase in cumulative net investment than does a given
increase in the equipment investment rate. This pattern is even more
apparent in net than in gross product growth.
and

C. Social Returns to Investment

We therefore interpret our results as suggesting that the private return
to equipment investment is below the social return, and that the social return
to equipment investment is very high. This raises the question of how to
move from our coefficient estimates to estimates of the social returns to
equipment investment.
We believe .hat our coefficients understate the true social return to
equipment. Consider economies moving along steady-state paths as in

lnvestnent and Growth

44

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

Solow [1956]. A regression of growth on capital formation will yield a zero
coefficient even though capital has a positive rate of return. The negative
correlation between the level of and rate of return to investment biases the
coefficient on investment down below the rate of return in the average
countly.
To formalize this argument, consider a cross-section of nations i in
each of which the marginal social product of net investment is ri, so that:
(4)

= r'(I-&K)

The average growth rate of output g1 over the sample is:

(5)

g = r{ON) - (KiY)'}

where (I/Y)i and (K/Y)i without time subscripts are the average investment

shares of national product and capital output ratios over the sample period
in country i. Writing i and k* for averages across countries of investment
shares and capital/output ratios, and r* for the average social product of net
investment in the sample, the expected value of the coefficient 3 from the
cross country regression of growth rates on gross investment shares will be:

(6)

= r + [i*k*]

cov[r',(I/Y)']

var((I/Y))

- r cov[(K/Y)', (IIY)'] + (higher order terms...
var((I/Y))

The second of the major terms in (6) shows that a negative correlation

between investment and social returns leads the coefficient to underestimate
the true return. Our interaction regressions suggest some diminishing
returns to investment, which would generate a negative cov[ri, (I/Y)i]. The
alternative is that some third factor shifts demand for equipment and leads
to high returns, high investment, and a positive cov[ri, (J/Y)i]. We discount
this possibility because of the association of high equipment investment and

investment and Growth

45

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

growth with low equipment prices.
We have used gross rather than net investment in this study; there is a
strong case that it is gross rather than net investment that matters for
productivity growth. If gross investment is the key determinant of growth,
then the third term in equation (6) is not present. But if net investment is the
relevant variable, then depreciation further biases the coefficient downward.
Depreciation appears in the third, the r*6(cov[K/Y, l/Y]/var(I/Y)) term in
equation (6). Countries that have a high capital/output ratio devote a large
share of national product to replacement investment. Differences in rates of
gross investment can be correlated with but overstate differences in rates of
net investment.
A factor in the other direction is that a unit of equipment investment
has an effect on output that does not come all in the first year but that
instead has some lag structure. If year-to-year output growth rates are
determined by a distributed lag on equipment investment like:

(7)

=

Then our cross section regression of average growth rates on average

equipment investment shares would produce a coefficient estimate greater
than the true social return to investment:

(8)

EU3) = p. > (1 -d)'p

where d is the appropriate discount rate. We have little insight into the

relevant lag structure, but suspect that the rapid economic depreciation of
equipment implies that its effect on output has a relatively small mean lag.
D. Implications for Economic Policy
A point often made (for example, Krueger [1990]) against the position
that investment has a high marginal product is that India has had a high

investment and Groii'rh

46

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

savings rate—Krueger estimates that it has risen ftom 14 to 22 percent over
the post-independence period—and yet has exhibited poor growth
performance, so the key to growth is not so much the accumulation as the
effective use of resources. We would not disagree: India appears to be very
close to the regression line relating equipment investment and productivity
growth depicted in Figure VI. India has a relatively high savings rate, but
equipment is expensive—more than twice as expensive in relative terms as
in Korea in 1980. As a result, equipment investment as a share of GDP is
about half of the sample average, even though Indian real non-equipment
investment as a share of GDP is slightly greater than the sample average.
From our standpoint according to which equipment investment is crucial,
India does not appear to have made good use of its high savings rate.
This argument—that it is not only the volume of savings but also
whether the savings are efficiently used to "buy" appropriate equipment—
may have a wide range of application. Another often cited counterexample
to the view that mechanization is the key to growth is the experience of
planned economies, which have emphasized equipment to the exclusion of
consumption and residences and grown slowly. These examples are not
clear cut—the Soviet Union in the 1950's and earlier appears to have seen
rapid growth in industrial production, especially in military goods, albeit at
the price of immense human misery. While our results suggest that high
rates of equipment investment may be necessary for rapid growth, we
certainly do not regard them as sufficient.
At a minimum, equipment must be directed to the most productive
uses. A growth strategy based on equipment investment must be market
conforming, not market replacing, to realize the very high social rates of
return on equipment investment that appear in the cross section of nations.
The strong interaction between equipment investment and outward
orientation in Table V may arise because an outward oriented economy
conforms to market forces, and does not try to replace them.
For these reasons, we interpret our results as implying that the social

Investment and Growth

47

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

rate of return to equipment investment is 30 percent per year, or higher.
Much of this return is not captured by private investors. If these results
stand up to scrutiny, they have obvious implications. The gains from
raising equipment investment through tax or other incentives dwarf losses
from any non-neutralities that would result. A 20 percent wedge between
the social return to eQuipment and other investment has implications for all
policies affecting saving and capital allocation.
Our finding that equipment investment is so important for growth
suggests an explanation for the striking differences in economic
performance realized by nations with "interventionist" governments that
have tried to jump start economic growth. From our perspective, the key
difference between countries ruled by "interventionist" governments in
South America and East Asia—despite the similarities in the rhetoric used
to justify intervention—lies in their quantities of equipment investment. All
the programs are all rationalized by similar appeals to "Schumpeterian"
rather than "Ricardian" advantage and to the crucial role of industry in
economic development (see, for example, Sheahan [1987] and Johnson
[1982]). But "industrial policies" in South America (aside from Brazil) and
Africa have for the most part turned out so badly, while activist
governments in East Asia have done well.
We suggest that the poor performers have confused support for
industrialization with support for industrialists. Policies that try to increase
the health of the equipment sector by enriching producing industrialists end
up raising prices and reducing quantities, and so are counterproductive—
even though existing industrialists are happy with such policies.
Frameworks that increase the quantity of equipment investment by
encouraging purchases appear to have been more successful. The
divergence between Latin American and East Asian outcomes and the
divergence in their relative quantity and price structures carries an important
insight into what a successful "industrial policy" is, and how it should be
implemented.

E. Views of Economic Growth
Yet another question is what do these results say about alternative
theories of economic growth. Beyond calling into question views which
overemphasize human capital accumulation through formal education, we
doubt that they help in choosing between alternative theoretical
formulations almost all of which allow for some type of important external
economy. Instead they point out the importance of disaggregation. This
calls into question the utility of research programs directed at spelling out
alternative mechanisms driving all of aggregate growth in single-good
models as if relative prices (and relative quantities) of different products did
not matter. Economists' emphasis on single-good models is odd given that
these models offer almost no scope for the relative price effects economists
stress in most contexts.
Our exploration of the links between equipment investment and
growth leaves many questions unaddressed. Three sets of issues strike us as
particularly important. First, are our results an artifact of the particular
natural experiment we have studied? We have examined growth and
equipment investment during the post-World War II period which contains
the largest boom and the largest expansion of trade and manufacturing that
the world economy has ever seen. Would equipment investment have been
so strongly correlated with growth if, say, the post-World War II period had
been more like the interwar period, with falling commodity trade and
protectionist pressures generated by unemployment in the industrial core?
Some studies of the pre-World War II have been conducted (for example,
Abramovitz and David [1973]; Abramovitz [1986]; De Long [1988];
McLean and Nguyen [1989]), but they view growth from a highly
aggregative perspective, their data is unreliable, and much remains to be
done.

Second, just what is the right measure of externality generating
investment? X-ray machines and large turbine generators are both classified

Investment and Gro%'th

49

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

as electrical machinery; oil drilling rigs and personal computers are both
classified as non-electrical machinery. Yet in each of these sets of goods
investment in one good may well have a very different impact on growth
than investment in the other. Much more disaggregated equipment
investment information is available in national income accounts data and
the ICP, but the problem of finding appropriate price deflators remains, and
plausible statistical procedures would soon run Out of degrees of freedom. It
may be possible to explore these issues using information on productivity at
the industry, firm, or regional level.
Third, how does equipment investment contribute to growth? As we
have just emphasized, aggregate production functions suggest much smaller
effects of equipment investment on growth than those that appear in the
post-WWII comparative cross section. Presumably some important external
economies operate. But we have little insight into exactly what they are, or
what their relative quantitative importance is.

Appendix I: Spatial Correlation
Many comparative cross country regressions have assumed that there

is no dependence across residuals, and that each country provides as
informative and independent an observation as any other. Yet it is difficult
to believe that Belgian and Dutch economic growth would ever significantly
diverge, or that substantial productivity gaps would appear within
Scandinavia. The omitted variables that are captured in the regression
residuals seem ex ante likely to take on similar values in neighboring
countries. This suggests that residuals in nearby nations will be correlated,
and that the sample contains less information than OLS regressions and
standard errors report.
To investigate the possibility and significance of spatial correlation

(Case, 1987), we formed, for all country pairs i and j, the product uiuj/2 of
the two fitted residuals from our basic regression on the high productivity
sample, normalized by the estimate of the residual variance. We then
regressed, using various functional forms, ujujJ2 on the distance ij (in
miles) between the capitals of nations i and j. An appendix table presents
the matrix of distances used.
The first functional form tried was:

(Al)

E(u.u.)
'

a2

=a+

+c
1 +X&

It yielded an adjusted R2 of -.0003, an estimated a of -.974 (with an
uncorrected OLS reported t statistic of -11.69), and an estimated X of
.0095569 for every thousand miles (with an uncorrected OLS reported t
statistic of .76). The estimated correlation between residuals varies from .03
for countries with adjacent capitals to -.05 for countries with capitals 10,000
miles apart.
A second functional form tried was:

exp[-A J + c

It also produced an adjusted R2 less than zero and a small estimate of X.
The estimated c was -.97 1 (with an uncorrected OLS reported t statistic of 11.96), and an estimated ? of .00969 for every thousand miles (with an
uncorrected OLS reported t statistic of .87). Once again, the estimated
correlation between residuals varies from .03 for countries with adjacent
capitals to -.05 for countries with capitals 10.000 miles apart.
The figure below plots the pairwise products of fitted residuals,
normalized by the residual variance, against the distance between national
capitals for the high productivity sample. There is a tendency for countries
located on opposite sides of the earth (Latin America and East Asia) to have
negatively correlated residuals, but the scatter is not supportive of the
hypothesis that neighboring countries have similar residuals.

sample, classifying them into four groups by whether they are positive and
negative and whether they are greater or less in absolute value than the
standard error of the estimate. The nations in the southern cone of South
America all have similar residuals, but the many European countries exhibit
no geographical pattern, and dominate the estimated coefficients in our
spatial correlation regressions.
Figure All
Geographical Residual Distribution for the High-Productivity Sample

We are quite surprised at the apparent absence of a significant degree
of spatial correlation in our sample, for much discussion tends to speak of
economic growth in terms of regions sharing a common growth path: the
southern cone, East Asia, southern Europe, Scandinavia, and so on. The
absence of spatial correlation in the fitted residuals raises the possibility that
the factors that lead countries within a region to follow similar growth paths
work through the rate of equipment investment.

For the high productivity sample, the table above shows that—

whether or not the aggregate investment rate is included in the regression—
the price of electrical equipment has a weaker relationship to growth than
does the price of non-electrical machinery. When both price measures are
included in the regresion, the non-electrical machinery price swamps the

Fri, Oct 5, 1990

Investment and Growth

electrical equipment price (and swamps the price of producers' transport
equipment when it is included as well). When the price variables are
included in the regression one at a time, the coefficient on the non-electrical
price is twice the coefficient on the price of electrical equipment. And the
shift from including the electrical price to including the non-electrical price
raises the adjusted R2 by 3/4.

For the larger sample, the prices of electrical equipment and non-

electrical machinery have identical coefficients in accounting for growth

Investment and Grmi'i/i

64

Fri. Oct 5, 1990

when entered into the regression separately. But the relationship between
growth rates and prices is very weak in the larger sample. When the total
investment rate is included as an independent variable, the relative price
variables are never statistically significant or substantively important.
The fact that the non-electrical machinery price is more closely
associated with growth than the electrical equipment price is somewhat
anomalous. In Table IV, the quantity of electrical equipment had a much
stronger association with growth than the quantity of non-electrical
machinery. The disparity of coefficients in Table IV might be taken to
suggest that it is electrical equipment—not equipment in general—that has
the most powerful association with growth. But this pattern in prices is not
mirrored in quantities: the electrical equipment price has a relatively
unimpressive association with growth.
If the only data available were the quantities data, it would be natural
to hypothesize that electrical equipment played a very special role in
economic growth. If the only data available were the price data, it would be
natural to hypothesize that it was non-electrical machinery that generated
