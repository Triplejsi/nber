POST-WAR ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE
GROUP-OF-FIVE COUNTRIES: A NEW ANALYSIS
ABSTRACT
An inter—country aggregate production function is estimated
using annual data for the post—war period drawn from the Group—
of—Five (G—5) countries: France, West Germany, Japan, United
Kingdom and United States. It is assumed that all countries have
the same underlying production function, not in terms of the
measured outputs and inputs, but in terms of efficiency—
equivalent units of outputs and inputs. The measured quantities
of outputs and inputs of each country may be converted into
efficiency-equivalent quantities of outputs and inputs by the
multiplication of country and commodity-specific and time—varying
augmentation factors. These augmentation factors are estimated
simultaneously with the parameters of the aggregate production
function.
Within this framework, the traditional assumptions for the
measurement of productivity-—constant returns to scale,
neutrality of technical progress and profit maximization——are
tested and all are rejected. Additional hypotheses about the
nature of technical progress are also tested. It is found that
technical progress may be represented as purely capital—
augmenting. In particular, the rate of augmentation is estimated
at between 14 and 16 percent per annum for France, West Germany
and Japan, and between 8 and 10 percent per annum for the U.K.
and the U.S. for the period under study. It is also found that
technical progress is capital-saving rather than labor—saving and
is therefore unlikely to be a cause of structural unemployment.
Using the estimated production function parameters, a
growth-accounting exercise is carried out and the results are
compared with those obtained from the conventional approach.
Technical progress is found to be the most important source of
growth, accounting for more than 50 percent, followed by the
growth of capital input. Together they account for more than 75
percent of the growth of real output in the Group—of—Five (G—5)
countries in the period under study. An international and
intertemporal comparison of the productive efficiencies is also
undertaken. It is found that the United States had the highest
level of overall productive efficiency for the whole period under
study. However, the productive efficiencies of France, West
Germany and Japan rose rapidly from less than 40 percent of the
U.S. level in 1949 to two—thirds of the U.S. level in 1985.
There is thus some evidence of convergence.
