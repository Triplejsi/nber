AGING AND THE INCOME VALUE
OF HOUSING WEALTH
ABSTRACT

The potential of reverse annuity mortgages to increase the
current income of the elderly is analyzed. We conclude that most
low-income elderly also have little housing equity, although this

is not always the case. In general, a reverse annuity mortgage
would substantially affect the income only of the single elderly
who are very old —— whose life expectancy is short. On the other
hand, if the transfer were in the form of a lump sum

rather

than an annuity -—

amount

——

the payment would increase the liquid

wealth of most elderly families by a large fraction. Thus
legislation that would facilitate the market for reverse
mortgages could improve substantially the financial status of a

small proportion of the elderly. But the specter of a large
number of poor widows with vast amounts of "locked—in" housing

equity does not reflect the reality. Most low-income elderly
have relatively little housing wealth.

AGING AND THE INCOME VALUE OF HOUSING WEALTH*

by
Steven F. Venti and David A. Wise

The vast majority of the personal saving of most Americans is in the form

of housing equity. Indeed most reach retirement age with very little liquid
wealth, like bank saving accounts. One might expect therefore that housing
wealth would be used to finance consumption as the elderly age. In fact
reverse annuity mortgages have been proposed to facilitate drawing down of
housing wealth while at the same time allowing families to continue living in

their homes. Yet recent studies have shown that at least through age 73
housing wealth is typically not reduced as persons age.1 We concluded in
earlier work (Venti and Wise (l989b, 1989a]) that the retention of housing
equity was not simply the result of transaction costs associated with moving.

Housing equity increases with appreciation in home values as long as a family
remains in the same home, but even the elderly who move from one home to

another are as likely to increase as to decrease housing equity. Thus we also
concluded that even if reverse annuity mortgages were readily available the

demand for them would be very limited. The implication was that the typical
elderly family did not want to reduce housing equity to finance other
consumption.

We analyze in this paper the extent to which housing equity could in fact
change the consumption of the elderly, if housing equity were converted to a

more liquid form. The mechanism for home equity conversion that we consider
is a reverse annuity mortgage. The primary goal is to understand the
potential effect on the current income of the elderly of conversion of

illiquid housing wealth into an income stream. The demand for reverse annuity
mortgages may be limited simply because these mortgages are too costly or
because families that have low income from other sources also have low housing

equity. We proceed as follows:
• First, we present the most recent data on the wealth of the elderly,
emphasizing the large fraction of non-pension assets accounted for by
housing equity.
• Second, we document that even among the older old housing equity is
typically not reduced as the elderly age. Our earlier results were
based on the Retirement History Survey (RHS) that followed elderly
persons only through age 73. The analysis in this paper is based on
the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), which includes
all age groups.
• Third, we consider whether housing equity is treated as a substitute
for liquid saving, by analyzing the relationship between housing equity
and the change (possibly the reduction) in liquid assets as the elderly
age. In particular, we ask whether persons with more housing equity
more likely to consume liquid wealth as they age?

• Fourth, the potential of reverse annuity mortgages to increase the
current income of the elderly is analyzed. In particular, we determine
by how much the current income of elderly families would be increased
if they were to obtain reverse mortgages, and thus convert housing
equity into cash that could be used for day to day expenses.
We conclude that most low-income elderly also have little housing equity,

although this is not always the case. In general, a reverse annuity mortgage
would substantially affect the income only of the single elderly who are very
old - -

were

whose life expectancy is short. On the other hand, if the transfer

in the form of a lump sum payment - - rather than an annuity - - the

payment would increase the liquid wealth of most elderly families by a large

(3)

fraction. Thus legislation that would facilitate the market for reverse
mortgages could improve substantially the financial status of a small

proportion of the elderly. But the specter of a large number of poor widows
with vast amounts of "locked-in" housing equity does not reflect the reality.
Most low-income elderly have relatively little housing wealth.

I.

The Data and Housing Equity versus other Wealth.

A. The Data.
The analysis is based on the first panel of the new Survey of Income and

Program Participation (SIPP). The SIPP is an ongoing rolling survey of the
U.S. population. It is organized by panel. Each panel consists of eight
interview waves administered every four months for 32 months. The first panel
initially contained approximately 20,000 households and was first surveyed in

1984. The fourth and seventh waves included questions about housing costs.
Most of the cross section results presented below are based on the fourth wave

(administered in September through December 1984). It includes 6,579
households with reference persons age 55 and over, 3,891 age 65 and over,

1,592 age 75 and over, and 291 age 85 and over. The longitudinal analysis is

based on the fourth and seventh waves.2 The seventh wave (administered in

2The fourth and seventh waves were not matched directly, but instead each
was linked to the 1984 SIPP Full Panel Research File, provided by the Bureau
of the Census. Without this special longitudinal file, it is not possible to
determine the reasons for changes in family composition between the fourth and
seventh waves.
The Census Bureau has provided the following statement about the data:
"This report uses data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation
1984 Full Panel (Preliminary) File, which was released by the Census Bureau
for research to improve understanding and analysis of the SIPP data. The data
on the file are preliminary and should be analyzed and interpreted with
caution. At the time the file was created, the Census Bureau was still
exploring certain unresolved technical and methodological issues associated
with the creation of this data set. The Census Bureau does not approve or
endorse the use of this data set. The Census Bureau does not approve or

(4)

September through December 1985) includes 4,947 households with reference
persons over age 55, 3,122 over age 65, 1,297 over age 75, and 263 over age
85.

The 1984 panel is the largest of the SIPP panels. Subsequent panels will

include approximately 12,000 households. Ultimately the number of old old in
all of the panels taken together will be much larger than the number now

available. Detailed analysis of some questions is not possible with the
current sample size. In particular, the number of homeowners that moved
between 1984 and 1985 is small. Nonetheless, the key questions that we pose
can be answered with considerable confidence.

B. Housing Wealth and the Composition of Total Wealth.
The composition of total wealth for all households, for homeowners, and
for renters is summarized in figures la, ib, and Ic, which are based on median

wealth by asset category.3 It is clear from figure la that most families
approach retirement age with very little personal saving other than housing

equity. For example, among households with heads 60 to 65, the median of

endorse the use of these data for official estimates."
3The numbers on which the figures are based, and the comparable means,
are shown in appendix tables la, lb, and ic of the working paper version of
this paper, Venti and Wise [1990], and are available from the authors on
request. In many instances throughout the paper both medians and means are
shown. Although the asset category means provide a consistent summary, in
that they sum to the total wealth mean, in some instances they are a
misleading indicator of the wealth of the typical household. This is
particularly true for liquid wealth; the median for all households is $7.8
thousand, compared to a mean of $34.3.

(5)

liquid wealth is only $6.6 thousand; the median of housing equity is $43.O.
The majority of families rely heavily on Social Security (SS) benefits
for support after retirement, and to a more limited extent on the saving that

is done for them by employers, through defined benefit pension plans. The
SIPP data allow estimation of the value of SS and pension plan benefits only

after the payments are received.5 Thus wealth in the form of SS and pensions
is only recorded for persons who have begun to receive the payments. Most
persons have retired by 65 and thereafter are receiving the benefits to which

they are entitled. About 59 percent of households with reference persons
between 65 and 70 receive pension benefits; 89 percent receive SS benefits.

The present value of pension and SS wealth is based on life tables together

with the amount of the annual payments. Social Security benefits are indexed
to inflation; private pension benefits typically are not.6 As can be seen
from figure la, SS and pension wealth is by far the most important component

of the wealth of most elderly. Among households with heads 65 to 70, for

4The category "liquid wealth excluding stocks" is broadly defined to
include interest earning assets held in banks and other institutions,
mortgages held, money owned from sale of businesses, U.S. Savings Bonds, and
checking accounts, less unsecured debt.
The category "liquid wealth
including stocks" also includes equity in stocks and mutual fund shares.
5The SIPP data do not contain SS earnings histories - - that determine SS
benefits, nor do they contain detailed pension plan provisions

6The present values of pension and SS benefits are the discounted
survival weighted streams of income from each source received by the reference
person and the spouse if present. Discounting is at 6 percent and survival
probabilities are calculated from mortality tables by sex. Payments from SS,
military pensions, federal employee pensions, and the railroad retirement
pension are assumed to be indexed at an annual rate of 4 percent. All other
sources of pension income are not indexed in the wealth calculations.

(6)

example, the median of SS and pension wealth combined is $113.4 thousand; the
median of housing wealth is $38.0 thousand and the median of liquid financial
assets is only $10.0 thousand. The decline in SS and pension wealth with age
is largely an artifact of declining life expectancy. As will be shown below,
the lower housing equity of older households is a cohort effect and does not
reflect a reduction of housing equity as individual households age; in fact,

housing equity increases on average as the elderly age; there is little change
in housing equity even among families that move from one home to another.
Comparison of figures lb and lc shows that households who rent have

substantially less wealth than homeowners in all asset categories. The median
total wealth of homeowners is $170.4 thousand; the median for renters is $59.3
thousand.

In summary: the majority of elderly households live on fixed annuity
income. The fixed income of most households could be increased by only a
small amount by depleting liquid assets; most households have very small

amounts of liquid wealth. Housing is the only form of wealth that could
potentially add appreciably to the fixed annuity income of the typical elderly

family. Whether housing equity is now used for this purpose is considered
next.

II. Aginz and Housing Eguity.
Because changes in housing equity -

market appreciation in home values - -

- other

have

than the increase due to

almost always been associated with

moving, we emphasize here the extent to which the elderly reduce housing

equity when the family preference is the easiest to realize. Based on the
Retirement History Survey (RHS), we concluded in an earlier paper (Venti and
Wise (l989a1) that elderly homeowners who moved, through age 73, were as

(7)

likely to increase as to decrease housing equity. Indeed, the average change
in the housing equity of movers was not significantly different from the
average change for stayers, whose housing equity increased simply because of

appreciation in home values. The largest changes were among those with low
income and high housing equity -

- who tended to reduce housing equity - - and

among those with high income and low housing equity - - who tended to increase

housing equity when they moved. We want to consider here whether that result
is different for the older elderly, who may be more likely to face the need to
use housing equity to meet other expenses.

Because of the small number of movers in the SIPP sample of elderly
households, it is not possible to obtain estimates from the SIPP data exactly

comparable estimates based on the PBS. A simplified version of our earlier
specification can be estimated, however. In addition, it is possible to
compare the housing equity of recent movers with the equity of those who have
owned their homes for some time. We consider each method in turn.

A. Moving and Change in Housing Equity.
Because of reporting errors, families who report an unusually high level
of income or housing equity in one year tend to report a lower level the next

year. That is, errors in variables create a regression toward the mean. This
tends to exaggerate the reported change in housing equity for movers with low
income and high housing equity and with high income and low housing equity.

We correct for this effect by considering only the change for movers that was
above and beyond the reported change for stayers.

This is accomplished be by using an analysis of variance specification

H1984 is the change in housing equity between 1984 and 1985, p +

represents the average change in housing equity for stayers in the th

income and the jth housing equity interval, and p'

represents the

change for movers. The estimates are normalized by setting

— 0.

Thus p

is

Xd 0 and

a weighted average change in housing equity for

households that do not move and p'

is

the weighted average change for movers.

Separate estimates are obtained for stayers and movers. The results are shown
in the top two panels of table 1.

The effect of reporting errors is clearly evident in the estimated

changes by income and housing equity for stayers. Households who report the
unusual combination of low income and high housing equity in 1984, tend to
report lower housing equity the next year; households who report high income
and low housing equity in 1984 tend to report higher housing equity the next

year. This is the regression toward the mean. There is essentially no
reported change for households who report income and housing equity around
their mean levels (income interval 2 and housing equity interval 2).

The pattern for movers is much more pronounced. Treating the change for
stayers as due to reporting errors, the actual change for movers can be
estimated by subtracting the change for stayers from the change for movers.

(9)

The average change for stayers is 1.6, with a standard error of 1.2; the

average for movers is -8.9, with a standard error of 5.3. Thus although there
is a reduction in the average housing equity of the small sample of movers, it
is not possible to reject the hypothesis that the average change for movers is
zero, nor that on average the change for movers is the same as the change for
stayers.

B. Housing Eciuitv and Years Since Purchase.
Data for a larger sample can be used by considering housing equity by the

number of years since the house was purchased. Table 2 shows median housing
equity by age and by the number of years since the home was purchased. These
data suggest that families that moved in the past three years. or in the past
six years, have approximately as much housing equity as households in the same

cohort that have owned their homes longer. Indeed, of households over 65.
recent movers tend to have the largest housing equity, suggesting that they
increased equity when they moved.

A more formal decomposition of the means into cohort effects, years owned
effects, and interaction effects, is provided by a specification of the form

where z is an overall mean, the a are age effects, the l are years owned

(10)

3, with the years owned effects to the right, the age effects across the

bottom, and the interaction terms as cell entries. The cohort effects show a
decline in housing equity with age, but given the cohort, there is little
relationship between housing equity and years owned, as indicated by the years

owned effects. In particular, families over 65 who have bought homes in the
last three years have no less housing equity than families who have owned
their homes longer; the relevant coefficient is -1.8 with a standard error of

4.2. The hypothesis that all of the interactions terms are zero cannot be
rejected, based on an F-test, nor can the hypothesis that both the interaction

and the years owned effects are zero. An F-test does reject the hypothesis
that the cohort effects are zero.
In summary:

Consistent

with the RHS

data,

the evidence from the small

sample of Sipp movers shows that families with unusually large amounts of home
equity wealth, given income, are likely to reduce home equity when they move;

families with unusually little home equity, given income, are likely to

increase home equity when they move. These data also suggest that when older
families move there may
small

sample

be

some reduction in home equity on average, but the

of movers does not allow a precise estimate. The data on home

equity by years since purchase suggest that older families do not typically

reduce housing equity when they move. We conclude therefore that the weight
of the evidence indicates little change, on average, in the housing equity of

older families when they move. The evidence for the older households in the
SIPP is consistent with the evidence for the younger old in the R}S.

At

the

time of a move, conscious choice does not lead to a reduction in housing

equity. But because of appreciation in home values, housing equity increases
among families who do not move. Thus these results, like similar results

(11)

based on the R}IS, suggest a limited demand for reverse annuity mortgages, were

they readily available. But among the small proportion of families with low
income and relatively large home equity, the demand could be important.

III. Is Home Equity a Substitute Liquid Wealth?
Although the findings reported in the previous section show little
reduction on average in housing equity as persons age, it may be that the
reduction in housing equity depends on the availability of other more liquid

assets and vice versa. It is common to treat home equity just like any other
form of saving, when considering saving and wealth accumulation, with the

implication that one is a good substitute for the other. If this were true,
and assuming that the elderly would like to hold some wealth for precautionary
purposes, it might be expected that the reduction in liquid assets with age

would depend on the amount of home equity, with those with more home equity
more willing to use liquid assets to meet current expenses.
To determine whether this is the case, we consider the change in liquid
wealth between 1984 and 1985 as a function first of housing equity and liquid
wealth, and then as a function of housing equity and total non-housing wealth.

Median changes are shown in table 4. The data suggest little relationship
between housing equity and decumulation of liquid wealth. The median change
in liquid wealth is

(12)

Yj

represents

the jth income interval effect, and (eY)jj the interaction

effect associated with the ith home equity and the jth income interval. The
estimates are shown in table 5. Unreported estimates with total non-housing
wealth instead of income yield similar results. Two aspects of the results
are striking: First the data show, on average, no decline in liquid wealth
with age; the weighted average is $2,000, with a standard error of $3,200.

Second, the data show no relationship between housing equity and the reduction

in liquid wealth. (The result is confirmed statistically by an R2 value of
0.002, indicating that there is no statistically significant relationship
between housing equity --

or

income -- and change in liquid assets.)

Thus

these data show no substitution of one form of wealth for the other.8 The
result of course may simply reflect the fact that most elderly have very
little liquid wealth and thus have almost nothing to deplete.

IV. Reverse l4ortzaees and the

Annuity

Value of Housina Equity.

The analysis in section II suggests that the potential demand for reverse
mortgages, even among the older old, is likely to be small on average; it
appears that the typical elderly family would not choose to withdraw funds
from housing equity to meet day-to-day living expenses, even if it were easy

to do so. And, the simple calculations reported in section III suggest that
depletion of other liquid assets is not typically substituting for transfers

from housing equity. In this section we consider directly the potential of
reverse mortgages to affect the financial position of the elderly. In

8Further evidence that different forms of assets may not substitute for
each other is provided by Shefrin and Thaler [1988] and Thaler [1990].

(13)

particular, how would they affect the current income of the poorer elderly,
if, contrary to the apparent limited demand for them, the elderly took
advantage of this financial instrument?

A. Assumntions.
The question is most easily addressed by considering the potential income

from a "life-time" reverse annuity mortgage. Assume that the bank obtains the
house at the death of the owner (or owners). In the meantime, the owner
continues to live in the house. Thus the bank will have title to an asset at
some uncertain future time. Suppose that the current value of the house is
Ha that it will appreciate at an annual rate g, that the owner who is now age
a will die at age t with probability d(tla), and that the bank discounts

future income at the rate m (possibly the mortgage rate). The present value
of the house to the bank is then

(4)

L —

—a

E+ta(tt+m(t

where A is as long as any owner will live, here taken to be 110. Assume that
L is the lump sum that the bank would pay the owner now for the future title
to the house.

The owner could in principle use the lump sum in any number of ways,

including investment in liquid assets like saving accounts or stock funds. To
assure a certain future income, however, the owner may wish to buy an annuity.

In this case, the income from the sum L depends on the "annuity yield," r.
l(tla) is the probability that the owner will be living at age t,

then

the

annual reverse annuity mortgage payment P is determined by the relationship

Both L and P are reported below for subsets of the SIPP population.
A life-time reverse annuity mortgage like the one described above tends
to exaggerate the potential income from housing equity, and is in fact the

least common of current arrangements. Sale-leaseback and fixed term loans

are

more common. Under the sale-leaseback arrangement, the bank buys the home
outright and leases it back to the owner. Fixed term loans provide a payment
to the owner for a fixed term. At the expiration of the term the loan
payments are repaid, through sale of the home. The "loan" is typically
restricted to 80 percent of the value of the home. Under some arrangements,
the owner shares in the appreciation of the home.9
The payment under the life-time annuity arrangement depends on several

parameters: the bank discount (mortgage) rate in, the home value appreciation

rate g, and the annuity yield r. New home mortgage rates averaged 8.80
percent in the 1970's and 12.31 percent between 1980 and 1987. The average
annual increase in the median price of one-family homes was 9.32

percent in

the 1970's and 6.22 percent between 1980 and 1985. The increase has not been
above 4 percent since 1981. Annuity yields are typically 4 to 6 percentage
points below the long-term interest rate, according to Friedman and Warshawsky

[1985]. In the calculations below, the bank discount rate is assumed to be 10

9For an overview of existing programs see U.S. HIJD

[1985].

(15)

percent, home values are assumed to appreciate at 5 percent a year, and the
annuity yield is assumed to be 5 percent.

To illustrate the sensitivity of the calculations to these assumptions
the annual payment to a single women with home equity of $45,700 (the median
housing equity of home owners over age 65) is shown in table 6 for several
ages and for alternative parameter assumptions.

B. Simulations.
The potential additional income from reverse annuity mortgage payments is

summarized in figures 2a through 2c. The figures are based on medians by
income interval and age. More detail is provided in appendix table 1 by
marital status, age, and income. An annual payment is calculated for each
homeowner. The income thirds are determined separately for each age interval.
(For example, the "low" income interval for persons age 65 to 70 refers to the

third of homeowners with the lowest incomes in the 65 to 70 age group.) For
comparison, the median income and the median home equity within each interval

are also shown. The SIPP "top codes" age at 85; thus all persons 85 or older
are reported to be 85. The annuity payment are calculated assuming that each
person in this age category is 85. Thus the simulated payments underestimate
the median payment to all persons 85 or older.

The amount
the

of

the reverse annuity mortgage payment depends on how long

family is expected to remain in the house. Thus the payments increase

with age because the expected number of
received

years

over which payments will be

declines (and because the bank obtains title to the house sooner).

Because life expectancy is greater for women than men at any age, the annual

payment is less for women than for men, given home equity. (Of course, home
equity may also differ.) Married couples will also tend to receive less than

(16)

single persons because payments will continue as long as either of them is

still living, according to our assumptions. Homeowners with higher incomes
also have higher reverse annuity mortgage payments because home equity
typically increases with income.

The income of typical married couples would be affected very little by
reverse annuity mortgage payments. The median income of couples is $24,625;

the median annual reverse annuity mortgage would be $1,358. Even for most low
income couples the median payment would be a small proportion of median annual

income. A reverse annuity mortgage would mean only a 4 percent increase in
the income of the typical low-income couple aged 55 to 60; it would mean

approximately a 10 percent increase for those 65 to 70. Only for the oldest
low income couples would a reverse mortgage mean a substantial relative

increase in income. For those who are 85 and over the increase would be about
35 percent. The payment is larger for the older group and their income is
lover.

Single persons stand to gain the most, in relative terms, from reverse
annuity mortgages primarily because they have much lower incomes than married

couples)0 The median income of single men is only 60 percent of the median
for couples; the median income of single women is only 44 percent of the
median for couples.

The median payment for low-income single men is almost

50 percent of their median income. The median payment for low-income single
women is about 36 percent of their median income. Indeed for both low-income

is consistent with the limited operational experience with reverse
mortgages. Three variants of reverse mortgage programs are summarized in U.S.
HUD [1985]. Single women accounted for 69, 89, and 82 percent of each
program's participation.

(17)
men and women 85 and over, the median reverse annuity mortgage payment is
almost

as large as other income. The difference between the payments

single

men and single women arises primarily because of the longer life

to

expectancy of women.

It is a common perception that
women - -

have

relatively large

widows - -

the

large majority of single

amounts of home equity wealth compared to

income. These data suggest that that is true only for the small proportion of
widows who have the lowest incomes and are at least 70 years old. But it is
not the situation of the typical widow. Overall, the median reverse annuity
mortgage payment is about 20 percent of the median income of widows.

One of the reasons that the annuity payments are so low is that the

annuity yield is low. The stream of

payments that can be

purchased" with a

dollar is much less than actuarially fair; either because the profit and fees
on annuities are large or because of adverse selection; the buyers of private

annuities may have unusually long lives. Thus a lump sum payment may be of
greater value than an annuity to the typical elderly person.11 Figures 3a
through 3c summarize the potential addition to liquid assets from reverse

mortgage lump sum payments. The figures are based on median values in each

interval. More detail is presented in appendix table 2. The table shows the
median potential reverse mortgage lump sum payment, together with median
liquid wealth and other non-housing wealth (principally pension and SS
wealth).

11Again, this is supported by the limited operational experience. Of the
first 43 reverse mortgages closed in a trial program in Buffalo during 198384, only four families chose to receive an annuity; the remainder chose a lump
sum option. See Weinrobe [1985].

(18)

The lump sum payments are typically much greater relative to liquid

wealth than the annuity payment is relative to annual income. The median lump
sum payment for married couples would be almost twice as large as median
liquid wealth, whereas the annuity payment would be less than 6 percent of

income. The median lump sum for low-income couples over 85 would be almost
ten times as large as liquid wealth. Relative to liquid wealth, the lump sum
is especially large for the oldest low-income single persons; the median for
single men and for single women is over 17 times as large as their median

liquid wealth, Indeed for the low-income oldest old single persons the lump
sum is approximately equivalent to all other wealth combined.

IV.

Summary.

Although

housing equity is the vast majority of the saving of most

Americans, the weight of the evidence from the 1984 SIPP panel suggests that
even the older elderly do not typically reduce housing equity as they age,

consistent with earlier findings for the younger old.12 In addition, summary
calculations show essentially no substitution of housing equity for nonhousing saving; the depletion or accumulation of non-liquid wealth with age

seems unrelated to housing equity. Indeed in this sample, the liquid wealth
of the typical elderly family changes very little with age. The median change

is zero. Thus

elderly live on Social Security and pension annuities

without using housing equity for current consumption. Because housing equity

12This conclusion is qualified because of the relatively small number of
movers in the sample. When the data from all four of the SIPP panels become
available and can be combined, a more precise estimate will be possible.

(19)

is such a large fraction of the non-pension wealth of most families, it

is

natural to consider the extent to which current consumption could be increased
by converting housing equity to liquid assets, that could be used for current
consumption.

Our

calculations

show that the income of most elderly families would be

increased very little if housing equity were converted to current income

through a reverse annuity mortgage. This may be a principle reason for the
limited demand for such mortgages. On the other hand, a reverse annuity
mortgage would double the income of typical single persons over 85. In
general, the relative addition to income from a reverse annuity mortgage
increases with age and is largest for low-income single persons.

Lump sum reverse mortgage payments would be much larger, relative to

liquid wealth, than annuity payments are relative to income. That is, the
elderly could increase liquid wealth much more than income by means of a

reverse mortgage. This is because most non-housing wealth of the elderly is
in the form of SS and pension assets -

- from

which most income is derived - -

and, to a lesser extent, because of the low yield on privately purchased
annuities.

Legislation that would facilitate the market for reverse mortgages could
improve substantially the financial status of a small proportion of the

elderly. But the specter of a large number of poor widows with vast amounts
of locked-in housing equity does not reflect the reality. Most low-income
elderly have relatively little housing wealth.
