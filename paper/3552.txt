THE AGGREGATE IMPLICATIONS OF MACHINE REPLACEMENT:
THEORY AND EVIDENCE
ABSTRACT

This paper studies an economy in which producers must incur
resource costs to replace depreciated machines.

The process of

costly replacement and depreciation creates endogenous
fluctuations in productivity, employment and output of a single
producer.

We also explore the spillover effects of machine

replacement by multiple, independent producers.

The implications

of our model are generally consistent with observed monthly
output and productivity fluctuations in automobile plants and
with monthly variations in employment and production in the
manufacturing sector.
