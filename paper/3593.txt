NBER Working Paper #3593
January 1991
THE EFFECTS OF PENSIONS AND RETIREMENT POLICIES
ON RETIREMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION
STRACT

A structural retirement model is estimated using data for
tenured, male faculty employed in the 1970's at 26 high quality
private colleges and universities.

Simulations of raising and

then abolishing the mandatory retirement age suggest very large
increases in full time work by faculty members in their late 60's
and early 70's.

Simulations also suggest that early retirement

incentive programs would offset only a small fraction of the
increase in work due to changes in mandatory retirement, and that
rents created by these programs exceed savings from induced early
retirements, with salaries of replacements further adding to
costs.

be less binding in academia than elsewhere,

becoming eligible for early retiremeot bonuses worth an additional one or two
year's salary.

In a model such as the one used in this paper,

such an eveut

would occur only if the coefficient on age in the utility function were
implausibly high, implying almost no response of retirement behavior to economic
incentives. Since these five retirements may well be due to health problems
which,

in the absence of information on health status, cannot be controlled icr,

and since these observations would dominate

the rc:sulrs if they were included

these five observations are excluded from the sample.

Defined benefit plans may carry special risks for those private institutions

which are highly dependent on endowment iocome, sod thus face correlated risks
in insuring their faculty against variation in returns to pension assets because
low returns may occur when the institution is least able to pay.

Moreover,

implications of defined benefit plans for penalties to mobile faculty,

activities once having left the primary employer.
Retirement flowa (transition rates) between any two years conform to flows
from the states of full-time,
the following year.

Reverse

part-time or retired to these same three states in
flows, from part-time work to full-time work and

from full-retirement to part-time work and full-time work are ruled our, so thar
retirement is an absorbing state.

Therefore, the probability of being retired

in a later year, giver, retirement in an earlier year, is 1.

As seen from the bottom

rows of each panel

in Table

A2, there is incomplete

information on all sequences which involve a period of partial retirement, and
in addition,

due to the scheme for data collection, anyone who retired before

1974 is lost to the sample.
