January 1991
INTERTEMPORAL LABOR SUPPLY: AN ASSESSMENT
ABSTRACT

The lifecycle labor supply model has been proposed as an

explanation for various dimensions of labor supply, including
movements over the business cycle, changes with age, and within—
person variation over time.

According to the model, all of these

elements are tied together by a combination of intertemporal
substitution effects and wealth effects.

This paper offers an

assessment of the model's ability to explain the main components
of labor supply, focusing on microeconomic evidence for men.

I conclude that the lifecycle labor supply literature sheds very little
light on the questions that first generated interest in a lifecycle

L The Ouestlons
A series of substantive questions motivated the original interest in
lifecycle labor supply.

Lucas and Rapping (1970). following an original

suggestion of Friedman (1976, pp.206-207),

posited

a lifecycle framework as

a way to reconcile an elastic short—run labor supply curve with an
inelastic or even backward—bending long—run labor supply curve.

Lucas and

Rapping's idea was to model cyclical hours variation as a response to a
temporary wage change.

Subsequently, much debate in the macroeconomics

literature has focused on the size of this Intertemporal wage elasticity.

A second motivation for studying lifecycle labor supply arose from
interest in human capital theory, and the recognition that the pattern of
lifecycle hours is influenced by the pattern of lifecycle wage rates.

Other questions have also emerged: what (if anything) can we conclude
about the interpretation of measured unemployment (Ashenfelter and Ham
(1979))? how does a lifecycle perspective affect the interpretation of the

responses measured in the Negative Income Tax experiments? how doer a"
inteigeneiational transfer system (such as Social Security) affect the

hours of young and old workers? Finally, and perhaps fundamentally, how
can we explain the enormous year—co—year variation in individual—specific
labor supply that appears in virtually every available panel data set?

The power of the lifecycle framework. and the extent of economists'
faith in the model, are illustrated by considering a

III. Enwirical Implications and Evidence

a. The Lifecvde Profile of Hours
The first snd most dirert implication of the lifecycle mod.l concerns

the shape of the lifecycle hours profile. As pointed out earlier, with
perfect foresight and constant real interest rates. the model implies that

the lifecycle profile of hours consists of a taste component, a trend, and
a component that is strictly proportional to wages.

The presence of

uncertainty adds other components with mean zero over a large sample of
lifecycles.

Hours at age t differ from hours planned at the beginning of the lifecycle
by a term representing the forecast error in wages, plus another
representing the cumulative forecast errors in interest rates and the

utility of income. Over a large sample of lifecycles (spanning
different periods of calendar time), the estimated age profile of lifecycle

The lifecycle profiles of hours in Figure 2 have a rather different
shape than rhe profile of wages.

and then decline sharply. The pattern of hours among chose who actually
work is similar. reaching a peak of about 2100 hours at: age 30, remaining

arable to age 50, falling to 1900 hours at age 60, and then declining

sharply. The growth in hours at the beginning of the lifecycle coincides
with a gradual withdrawal from school.

Of course this does not refute the lifecycle model, because

tastes may vary systematically with age. and it is also possible that the
intertecnporal substitution elasticity varies with the number of hours

worked.

A stronger test is provided by the data in Figures 4 and 5, which
represent "age and conditional hours profiles for men in 3 education
classes: 0—0 years of schooling, exactly 12 years of schooling, and 16 or

more years of schooling.15 Between the ages of 30 and O the "age profiles
of these three groups differ dramatically. Wages of college graduates grow
some 40 percent, "ages of highschool graduates grow about 20 percent. and

wages of individuals with minimal schooling grow only 10 percent. However,

14The "age profiles are also potentially biased estimates of the "age
profiles for the "hole population, since we only observe "ages for workers.
One way to evaluate the size of this bias is to assume that "ages for those
not working would be at some lower bound (say. the minimum "age) and then

re—calculate the average "age. This procedure suggests that rhe bias in
the "age profiles up to age 50 is trivial.

model requires a fairly elaborate set of taste parameters. 16 A simpler
interpretation is that the shape of the wage profile bears no causal
relation to the shape of the hours profile.

It also is interesting to compare the three education classes in terms

of their average lifetime hours and average lifetime wages. For
simplicity, assume that individuals with 0—8 years of schooling begin work

lifecycle; the age profile of hours; aggregate movements in hours; and
individual—specific variation in hours around the lifecycle profile. All
of these components are tied together by a combination of interteliq3otal
substitution

effects and wealth

effect.

itt this paper I have tried to

34

gauge the success of lifecycle model in explaining the various dimensions
of male labor supply.

My assessment is hardly positive: the only real

success for the model has come as a description of aggregate patterns in
wages and hours during the post—1970 period.

Even here, my suspicion is

that a careful consideration of wealth effects will undermine the success
of the model.

Much of the inicroeconometric research over the past two decades has

on the magnitude of the intertemporal substitution effect, and

concentrated

in particular on U
individual—specific

variation.

As Pencavel noted in his 1986 survey,

the available evidence suggests that this effect is of second—order
importance. My view is that a similar conclusion holds with respect to the

intertempora]. substitution effect in the age profile of hours. With
respect to the permanent component of hours, there is
literature. A

fairly wide—spread belief among labor economists is that a

permanent increase in wages leads to

panel data

a

reduction in hours. Using modern

it is surprisingly hard to verify this hypothesis, and

Two major

avenues for further work are suggested.

A variety of models suggests that individual hours are

directly by

employer—specific demand conditions. Limited

evidence confirms this suspicion.

If true, our basic notions of

labor supply of 4814 men age 16-64 with same employer over 9
quarters (1983—W to 1985—I) in 1983 SIPP panel. All equations
are estimated in first—difference form, and include 9 unrestricted
quarterly dumies as well as potential experience. Log wage is
instrumented by the change in log wages of the same person 4
quarters in the past (or 4 quarters in the future. for observations
from the first 3 quarters of the sample) . The standard deviations
of the dependent variables are: log hours per week —— 0.142; log
