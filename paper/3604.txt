GOVERNMENT REVENUE FROM FINANCIAL REPRESSION

ABS TRACT

This paper presents an analysis of the theoretical
underpinnings and the relevance of the phenomenon of financial

repression from a public-finance perspective. The analysis
explicitly accounts for the interaction between capital controls

and financial repression. The proposed empirical estimate of the
revenue from financial repression is based on the difference
between the domestic and the foreign cost of borrowing of the

government. The correlations of the revenue from financial
repression with inflation, exchange rates and per-capita income
are discussed.

1 Introduction
Most developing countries impose controls on international capital
flows, coupled with controls on domestic financial intermediaries.
These phenomena have been extensively studied in development

economics, and are labelled "financial repression". Analyses of
the effects of financial repression, like those by McKinnon (1973),
Shaw (1073) and Fry (1988), point to the inefficiencies arising from
controls on international asset trade and domestic financial interrncdia.ries and set forth clearcut policy prescriptions, which have
been followed, under thc auspices of international institutions, by
a number of countries. These prescriptions envisage a removal of
controls on international asset trade, together with the removal of
price and quantity rationing in domestic financial intermediation.1
While the theoretical analyses of the effects of controls on fi-

nancial markets are clearly correct, their direct applications to
policy have neglected the presence of important additional distortions in the economy. More satisfactory approaches to financial
liberalization should explicitly account for these pre-existing distortions, including the ones associated with government spending
and taxes. In particular, considering the effects of government revernie constraints and the distortions associated with different forms
of taxation would provide a more complete assessment of the costs
and benefits of financial controls and financial liberalization.2

In this paper we provide empirical evidence to highlight the
interactions of financial controls and tax policies. Indeed, we regard government-imposed controls on domestic financial markets
as a form of taxation, and we estimate the amount of revenue that
developing countries have obtained from it. Our approach is a natural extension of the ideas of Phelps (1973) and his followers, who
pioneered the study of government policies and their distortions
from the perspective of public finance.3 We do not, in this paper,

attempt to provide any normative statement on whether or not
liberalization is a desirable strategy to follow.4 Our more limited
objective is to point to the first-order impact of liberalization policies on government budgets. The size and nature of government
revenue from financial repression will indicate the extent to which
liberalization policies affect public finances, and will raise the question of adjusting the budget by changes in taxation or government
spending.
Section 2 illustrates the budgetary impact of financial repression. The exposition highlights the linkage with international capital controls, and characterizes the choice between these distortions
and other types of taxes available to governments. Section 3 describes the methodology of the empirical analysis, and our data
set, which comprises 24 countries, over the 1972—1987 period. Section 4 presents the results of the empirical analysis, while Section
5 offers some concluding remarks. The Appendices explain the calculations and report all data sources used in the empirical work.

2 Interest-Rate Distortions and Public Finances
In this section we illustrate the effects of "financial repression" on
government budgets, and ask whether or not it could arise from optimizing behavior by governments. "Financial repression" is not a
precise concept since the controls on financial markets imposed by
developing countries' governments are typically the sum of price

and quantity restrictions. A typical set of restrictions includes
the prohibition on domestic residents from holding financial assets abroad, coupled with compulsory quotas of government bonds
in financial iritcimncdiarics' portfolios. Since these quantitative restrictions are not administered efficiently (both prices and quantitics arc typically fixed), they give rise to monopoly profits which

do not accrue directly to the government. Hence the conditions
that make quantity restrictions equivalent to price restrictions are
likely not to occur in most developing countries.
To illustrate the effects of financial repression we set aside the

the effects on the volume and composition of tax revenue.

above-mentioned inefficiencies of its administration, and therefore
assume that it works like a tax, whose revenue (at least in the first
case we look at) is entirely appropriated by the government.5 This
approach is justified by the objective of emphasizing the effects
of financial repression on the government budget and considering
financial repression as part of an overall optimal taxation problem.

2.1 Financial Repression as Optimal Tax Policy

The essential features of financial repression are the distortions
on the intertemporal terms of trade faced by private individuals,
and the distortions in their portfolio allocation decisions. These
features are best highlighted in the standard two-period Fisherian
model of an open economy. Consider an economy populated by
identical consumers-investors maximizing a utility function of firstand second-period consumption. Government spending, which oc-

curs in the first period only,6 also yields utility (but the utility
function is separable in consumption and government spending).
In the first period individuals purchase the consumption good, do-

mestic assets and foreign assets. In the second period they use
the net-of-tax return on their investment, and their second-period
endowment, to purchase the consumption good. Since the country
is small, its own savings and investments do not affect the world

rate of interest. The model is cast in real terms. The absence of
nominal aggregates like the exchange rate rules out important nonneutralities from the interaction of nominal interest rate ceilings
and the rate of currency depreciation and inflation—which will be
discussed below in section 2.2—but does not affect the generality
of the results.
We consider first the extreme case where individuals' endowment is fixed and exogenous, but the government has no means of
raising revenue, except through the distortions resulting from financial repression. The government spends only in the first period,
and finances its spending by borrowing domestically and abroad.
Financial repression is thus represented by a tax r on the second5The effects of partly relaxing this a.sumption are also discussed.
6Government spending in both periods does not change the nature of the problem in any
interesting way, but complicates the exposition slightly. Hence it is ruled out.

given E1, E2 (endowment income in the two periods), r* (the
world rate of interest), r (domestic interest rate), r, and C (government spending). A represents holdings of foreign assets, while
B are domestic government bonds. Note that in a two-period setting like this there is no important distinction between interest
for

payments and principal repayment, and to simplify the algebra we
assume the tax is levied both on interest and principal. Since there
is no uncertainty or transactions costs, investors require the same
after-tax return on all available assets, domestic and foreign (assets
are perfect substitutes). Equilibrium in private agents' portfolios
implies:

(1 + r*)(1 — r) = 1 + r.
(4)
In other words, the tax on foreign interest income proportionally
lowers the interest paid on domestic liability. Equation (4) illustrates the concept of financial repression adopted in this paper.

Financial repression is a distortion that drives the domestic rate
of interest below the world rate. This distortion affects public
finances, and can be studied within an optimal-tax framework.
The problem (1)—(3) implies the familiar first-order condition,

much theoretical and empirical work, stressing the effects of financial repression on savings (see, for example, Fry (1982, 1988) and
Giovannini (1985)). The recent evidence pointing to low elasticity
of intertemporal substitution in consumption suggests that the welfare cost of this distortion should not be very high.8 Solution of the
system (2), (3), (4) and (5) gives the optimal consumption-savings

decision of individuals, for given values of the tax. Notice that,
since domestic and foreign investments are perfectly substitutable
and yield the same net return, their shares in private portfolios are
indeterminate. The solution of the consumption problem only tells
us how much consumers will save (total accumulation of assets),
but not the composition of the portfolios. B can be chosen freely
by the government: any choice of B implies a choice of A by the
private sector. The sequence of government budget constraints in
periods one and two, respectively, is:

G=B+F

F(1 + r*) + B(1 + r) = A(1 + r*).r

(6)
(7)

Government spending occurs only in the first period, and is financed by domestic borrowing (B) and foreign borrowing (F). In
the second period tax revenue has to equal the costs of servicing
domestic and foreign loans (equation (7)). The net cost of foreign
loans equals r, while the net cost of domestic loans, from equation
(4), is r*(1 — ) — T.9 Solving (7) for F, and substituting it into
(6) we have:

G=(A+B)r

(8)
Equation (8) says that interest-rate distortions generate a revenue
to the government that is proportional to the total stock of assets

held by investors in the first period. The optimal choice of r can
now be easily determined:10 the government chooses G to maximize (1) subject to the private-sector budget constraints (2) and
80n the other hand, financial repression might give rise to much more serious production
distortions, associated with suboptimal investment in domestic productive activities.

9The second term is the tax on the principal. In this two period model, however, the
distinction between gross (1 + r) and net (r) payments is not meaningful, since capital is
worthless in the second period.

construction.

it equalizes the marginal welfare cost of the tax with the marginal
welfare gain.'1
This model highlights the basic effects of financial repression on
the government and consumers, but also raises several issues. First,
financial repression may not be enforced by levying an explicit tax
on domestic-residents' foreign- asset income. Developing countries'
governments restrict international capital flows—thereby forcing a

differential between foreign and domestic interest rates—but are
not in general able to raise any revenue from income produced
by domestic residents' foreign investments,12 and, as we argued
above, they might not be efficiently allocating the rents arising
from any quantitative restrictions. These problems can be tackled
by assuming that financial repression and capital controls still induce a wedge between domestic and foreign interest rates, but the
government is unable to obtain revenue from this implicit tax on
foreign investments' income: the quota rents become a deadweight
loss.13 The government's intertemporal budget constraint (8) is
thus transformed:

F+B=BT
With a tax rate less than 100 percent the government would in this
case want to borrow domestically at a lower rate to lend abroad
(F < 0), in order to gain from the interest-rate differential.
This result leads to the second issue—namely, that consideration of a more general model, featuring several alternative revenue
sources together with financial repression, might modify the optimal choice of financial repression characterized above. Would
financial repression still be chosen by a government that followed
optimal public finance rules?
"The effects of the tax on savings disappear from the first-order condition, by the envelope
theorem.
'2lndeed, those very foreign investments are often motivated by the desire to evade or avoid
domestic taxes. See, for example, Tanzi (1983).
'3Alternatively, one could rely on an explicit model of international tax evasion, whereby
the fraction of revenue lost to foreign investments would be determined endogenously.
6

Such model of an open economy with (possibly many) production technologies and (possibly many) sources of government rev-

enue falls within the model optimal taxation with international
trade surveyed, for example, by Dixit (1985, section 3.2).' J
the presence of constant-returns-to-scale domestic production technologies, and maintaining the constraint that lump-sum income—
or first-period endowment—cannot be taxed directly, the standard
production efficiency theorem (Diamond and Mirrlees (1971)) applies: taxes can drive wedges between the marginal rate of substitution of any two commodities in consumption and the marginal

rate of transformation, but they should not distort the marginal
rate of transformation away from the foreign rate of transformation, which is represented by the world relative price of any two
commodities. Specifically, assume that second-period goods can
be produced with domestic technologies that use labor and capital,
and that investment transforms first-period goods into productive

capital. Then the marginal rate of transformation of first-period
goods into second-period goods would equal the domestic rate of
interest, and production efficiency implies that taxes should not
drive a wedge between the latter and the world interest rate—
the foreign marginal rate of transformation of first-period goods
into second-period goods. Under these conditions output is maximized at world prices,15 and production efficiency implies that,
when there are no constraints on the choice of taxes by the government, financial repression should be avoided.
This result has two implications: first, financial repression might
be justified as an efficient means to raise government revenue only
if there are constraints on the types of taxes that governments can
impose. We discuss these constraints below. Second, the elimination of financial repression is a justifiable policy when the gov-

ernment can indeed rely on a relatively broad tax base, and an
efficient system of imposition. In other words, financial liberalization might require a fiscal reform to cover the revenue shortfall.
The revenue from financial repression—and hence the amount of
14The intertempot-al nature of the model discussed here is of course fully consistent with
the Arrow-Debreu setup employed by Dixit.
15Notice, from equation (7), that the relevant relative price of second-period goods for the
government is the world rate of interest.

7

additional revenue to be raised after the liberalization of financial
markets—is estimated in Section 4•16
We conclude this section with a discussion of the factors that
might justify the imposition of financial repression as a means of
taxation. The first is the presence of costs in the administration
of alternative forms of taxation. Gordon and Levinsohn (1989),
for example, suggest modeling the administrative costs associated
with the use of different tax bases as fixed costs: in order to set up
the necessary bureaucracy to organize, administer, and monitor a
given tax, the government has to incur an initial "capital" expense.
In some countries, and for certain taxes, this initial expense may

be very high. Income taxes or value-added taxes, for example,
can be costly to raise in developing countries.'7 Using the mod-

els discussed above one could show, trivially, that when the fixed
costs required to levy other taxes are high enough, the government
uses only financial repression.'8 The second factor justifying the
use of financial repression is the application of distributional criteria by the government. Redistribution objectives can be achieved
by taxing the return to capital, thereby inducing the production
distortions illustrated above, and transferring income away from
capitalists to wage earners. Finally, political considerations may
favor the less transparent means of taxation that is characteristic
of financial repression.

2.2 The Financial Repression Tax and the Inflalion Tax
The discussion in the previous section has relied on models where
money has no role. In practice, however, financial repression is
typically the result of nominal interest rate ceilings that are well
below the prevailing rate of inflation and currency depreciation. It
revenue is implicit;, since, as the discussion above has illustrated, iL is really reflected
in a fall in budgetary expenditures, rather than in an increase in revenues.
'7Lndeed, many countries (including industrial countries) estimate income taxes based on
tangible wealth holdings of the taxpayers (see OECD (1988)). A more accurate, voluntary
system of tax assessment with the backup of government audits might not be viable in many
poor countries. Value-added taxes require an efficient system of border adjustments, as well
as a sophisticated method of tax assessment based on individual producers' returns.
'8Deviations from production efficiency are justified also when domestic production gives
rise to pure profits, that are not easily taxable by the government. See Giovannini (1988) for
an illustration.

8

is often argued, based on this fact, that the distortions in the real
interest rates arising from inflation should be included in the definition of the inflation tax. This argument is incorrect, however,
since the inflation-tax base is high-powered money, while financial
repression affects the portfolio of non-monetary assets held by domestic residents, and the base for the financial-repression tax we
concentrate on is government debt. Indeed, the models discussed
in the previous section show that the presence of inflation in the
economy is by no means a necessary condition for governments to
be able to extract revenue from financial repression. Therefore it
is appropriate to distinguish financial repression from the inflation
tax.
The potential complementarities between the financial-repression
tax and the inflation tax should, however, be stressed. First of all,
the interest savings on government liabilities can be obtained following an inflation policy that—given nominal interest rate ceilings—
implies very low real interest rates: we will consider below to what
extent this proposition is borne out in the data. Second, the presence of a limited array of financial instruments and negative real
interest rates increases, other things equal, money demand—i. e.
the inflation tax base.19 Another form of financial repression, the
imposition of reserve requirements, directly increases the inflation
tax base (by increasing demand for high powered money, whenever
required reserves are in cash).2°
For all of these reasons, it is to be expected that the inflation tax
is used together with financial repression in developing countries.
The complementarity between these two forms of imposition, however, will break down at very high rates of inflation. In these cases
the real return on domestic investments is so heavily depressed that
there is flight towards safety—represented for example by gold, dollars or other foreign assets—even if that entails substantial costs,
and risks of penalties. These phenomena have been documented,
for instance, by Makinen and Woodward (1990): the flight towards
safety dries out financial markets and at the same time produces a
'9See Dornbusdi and Giovannini (1988). In addition, it might be possible to produce
examples where the production distortions induced by the inflation tax are offset by the low
domestic real interest rates that result from financial repression.
20In several countries, required reserves are in terms of government securities.

drop in money demand: financial repression and the inflation tax
become substitutes.

3 Data and Calculations
The discussion above suggests that we can measure the government revenue from financial repression as the difference between
the foreign cost of borrowing and the domestic cost of borrowing.
This difference is an implicit tax on domestic lenders that is often
implemented with a combination of international capital controls
arid requirements for domestic financial institutions (often public)
to hold government debt at less than market interest rates. Thus
the tax revenue from financial repression equals the differential between the foreign and domestic cost of borrowing multiplied by the
stock of domestic government debt.
This measure of government revenue from financial repression
is a conservative one since it relates to central government only, excluding the central bank, state and local government, and governmentowned enterprises whose low interest payments on their liabilities
also represent budgetary savings, although indirect ones. The domestic and foreign borrowing costs are measured ex post. That

is, the foreign borrowing cost includes the dollar interest rate on
external debt, the realized change in the value of the domestic currency vis-à-Vi3 the dollar, and the change in value of liabilities in
currencies other than the dollar (the "dollar revaluation effect" to
be described in detail below), while the domestic interest cost is
the domestic-currency interest rate on domestic debt.
The sample is composed of countries considered to be "developing" at some point (luring the period covered, which is 1972
through 1987. Given the basic approach explained above, the selection criteria have been (i) the existence of significant foreign
commercial borrowing by the central government—indicated by
a stock of commercial debt outstanding and disbursed (DOD) of
about $ 200 million or more21—and (ii) the availability of data on
the stock and cost of central government domestic debt. A total of
21Foreign commercial debt is defined as LIBOR-based borrowing in creditor categories 2
(financial institutions) and 6/7 (bonds floated on international finandal markets) of the World
Bank Debt Reporting System.

10

38 countries can be identified by criterion (i). Criterion (ii) reduces
the coverage to 24 countries, and entails dropping primarily countries in Africa and Latin America. In addition, data are available
for only part of the time period chosen for any one country.
The Appendices contain a detailed description of the data sources.

The general strategy was to rely to the maximum extent possible on the same statistical sources, including the World Bank
Debtor Reporting System (DRS) and the IMF Government Financial Statistics.
The same approach is used to measure foreign and domestic
interest costs—namely, the calculation of an effective interest rate.
For the foreign interest rate, total annual dollar interest payments
(INTP$) plus the change in interest arrears as reported to the DRS
by the debtor (INTA$) are taken as a percentage of average annual
dollar DOD. Arrears are included because we assume that countries
face given world rates of interest, thus including arrears allows us to
obtain an estimate of the "normal" cost of borrowing.22 The DRS
includes in interest payments any front-end or other fees where
these are known: there were no rescheduled interest payments on
commercial debt in the years and countries included in our sample.
Thus the nominal effective dollar interest rate (EFFINT$) is:

EFFIN T$(t) =

[INTP$(t) + INTA$(t)]
[(DOD$(t — 1) + DOD$(t))/2]

where DOD$(t) indicates dollar debt outstanding and disbursed at
the end of year t, and the average debt outstanding and disbursed
during the year t is estimated through linear interpolation.23 LIBORbased borrowing of the central government only is used to determine the foreign cost—except for Algeria, Greece and India, where
LIB OR-based borrowing of public corporations is used as a proxy.

For the domestic interest rate, annual local-currency interest
payments on central government domestic debt (INTP) are taken
22To the extent that actual arrears are greater than reported arrears, the normal cost of
foreign borrowing—and hence the government revenue reported below—will be understated.
231t is possible to perform a rough check of the accuracy of our method by comparing the
effective interest rate we obtain with LIBOR. This comparison indicates that our estimates
covary closely with LIBOR. Discrepancies are likely to arise because our estimates, correctly,

include any commercial fees as part of the cost of the loan, and other reasons discussed
elsewhere in this section.

11

as a percentage of the average domestic debt outstanding. Typically, governments do not incur arrears on their domestic debt; but,

to the extent that they do, arrears are another form of financial
repression, and are correctly included with out effective-interestrate method. Thus the nominal effective domestic interest rate

(EFFINT) is:

EFFINT(t) =

INTP(t)
[(DOD(t — 1) + DOD(t))/2]

where DOD(t) denotes total—including holdings of monetary authorities—domestic debt outstanding and disbursed (expressed in
domestic currency).24 The taxable status of interest on internal
government debt is ignored, since it can differ by debt holder as well
as by debt instrument. Furthermore, it is arguably more transparent to consider revenues and expenditures separately (and therefore preferential treatment becomes a separate tax expenditure).
An alternative to the calculation of these effective interest rates
would be to compute the weighted value of the contractual interest
rates on foreign and domestic debt, taking into account the outstanding stock and maturity of each category as well as changes

in the applicable interest rate over time. Much of the information required for this method is however lacking, especially on the

domestic side, where in many countries a breakdown of all the
different types of government bonds, together with their contractual interest rates, is simply not available. Hence the potential for
error of our method is much smaller. Independently of problems
of data availability, our effective rates can differ from contractual
rates for two reasons. First, there might be fluctuations in the
timing of interest payments and in the declaration of foreign arrears. And second, there may he differences between the actual
average stock outstanding and our estimates based on the average
of end-of-period stocks.
In addition to the foreign interest rate on dollar-denominated
debt, there are two other components to the foreign cost of borrowing. One is of course the average annual change in the value
24The holdings of monetary authorities are included in the calculations of the effective
interest rate because the treasury normally pays interest to the central bank on interestbearing debt.
12

of the domestic currency vis-d-vis the dollar, which is used to aggregate country debt data. This indicates the change in the localcurrency value of the stock of external dollar-denominated debt.
The other is the revaluation (in dollars) of external debt denominated in non-dollar currencies. It is captured by subtracting net
dollar disbursements from the change in dollar DOD (adjusted for
any rescheduling) from the beginning to the end of the year.25
Finally, the government revenue from financial repression is calculated by computing the differential between foreign borrowing
costs and the domestic borrowing cost, times the average annual
stock of domestic debt. In this calculation, an important adjustment has been made to central government domestic debt, namely,

the elimination of debt held by the monetary authorities. Even
though the central bank receives interest on its holdings, the acquisition of government debt is financed by increases in the money
supply, and not borrowing within a resource-constrained environ-

ment. Thus it has little to do with the existence or absence of
financial repression and is different from, rather than a substitute
for, foreign borrowing. Moreover, the interest rate paid on government debt held by the central bank is not really a cost, since
interest receipts contribute to central bank profits which are typically returned to the budget.
Aside from restricting the government sector to central government, there are three other reasons why the estimates of the revenue from financial repression we report may be understated. First,
we disregard the second-order effect of changes in the exchange rate
on foreign interest payments. Second, arrears on foreign debt may

be understated. And third, the stock of non-interest-bearing domestic government debt may be underreported: its inclusion would
lower the estimate of the effective interest rate, thus raising the implicit tax on domestic lenders. It would also increase the estimate
of the financial-repression tax base, thus raising the revenue from
financial repression.
25These items can be positive or negative but have typically added to the foreign cost of
borrowing. Both of these non-interest elements represent accrued cost, of which only part is
amortized annually.

4 Results
As we explained above, the measure of the revenue from financial repression used here is the ex-post differential between foreign

and domestic interest rates, times the stock of government debt
held outside the central bank. This measure, however, cannot be
used as a formal statistical test of the presence or absence of financial repression. The reason is that surprise exchange-rate changes
would significantly affect the relative cost of domestic debt even in
countries where financial markets are relatively free, and capital

controls are virtually absent. In a small sample, our estimate of
revenue from financial repression would be biased towards rejection
of the null hypothesis (absence of controls) whenever devaluations

have occurred—and have been greater than anticipated. In the
cases where devaluations have not occurred, or have been less than
anticipated, our measure would be biased in the opposite direction,
since domestic liabilities would, in the sample, be more costly than
foreign liabilities: this is the well-known "peso problem" •26 We refrain from carrying out formal statistical testing also because the
time coverage of the countries in the sample varies widely. In any
case, however, the data we report do represent budgetary savings
to central governments—whether voluntary or involuntary.
Tables 1 and 2 contain the estimates of the annual revenue from
financial repression for each of the countries, in the years for which
data are available. We measure this revenue both as a fraction of
GDP (table 1) and as a fraction of total central government revenue

(table 2). The tables also report the average revenue by country
across years. The last column on the right of table 1 reports the
average financial repression tax rate, that is the difference between
foreign and domestic interest costs.
Table 1 shows that revenue from financial repression has ranged
from 0 in Indonesia, where domestic government debt is held exclusively by the central bank, to 6 percent of GDP in Mexico and
Zimbabwe, where the effect of unanticipated exchange-rate changes

probably plays an important role, due to the short sample. In
seven countries it exceeds 2 percent of GDP, and in five countries
26S Lizondo (1983).

14

it exceeds 3 percent. The significant cross-country variation is accompanied by substantial time-variation.
Table 2 shows that financial repression has been as high as 40
percent of government revenue in Mexico (where in 1987 it was as
high as 83 percent of GDP, see below for discussion), and about 20
percent in India, Pakistan, Portugal, Sri Lanka, and Zimbabwe. In
general, tables 1 and 2 suggest that in many countries a financial
liberalization will generate a substantial budgetary problem, and
should be accompanied by a fiscal reform aimed at substituting for
the revenue loss.27

The possible effects of financial liberalization can be gauged
from table 3, reporting the breakdown of ownership of domestic
government debt. For completeness, the table includes centralbank holdings, even though those are not included in the calculation of the financial-repression tax base. The second column in
the table includes holdings of deposit money banks only—a subset of domestic financial intermediaries. The table shows that,
for the years where we have data, on average 24 percent of total government domestic debt, and 37 percent of domestic debt
in the hands of the public, is held by deposit money banks. The
holdings of other financial institutions are included in the column
labelled "other", but unfortunately could not be singled out for
lack of data. Financial intermediaries, and among them deposit
money banks, typically offset artificially low rates on their assets
by paying low rates on their liabilities—savings and time deposits:
this is an example of the translation of the financial repression tax.
In these cases the effect of a financial liberalization is an increase
in the cost of liabilities to financial intermediaries, since domestic residents can access higher-yielding portfolio investments elsewhere. In absence of an increase in interest rates on government
securities, financial intermediaries would thus risk bankruptcy, and
would possibly require public bailout. Hence the likely budgetary
impact of financial liberalization is either the cost of the bailout of
these intermediaries, or an increased cost of debt servicing, which
would occur if government securities were mostly short-term.
27Q this topic, see, for example, Thirsk (1990). This conclusion is based on the assumption
that the world rate of interest paid by the government on its foreign debt is exogenous, i.e.
the small country assumption.

Tables 4 and 5 report the two components of the revenue from
financial repression: interest-rate differentials and changes in exchange rates (inclusive of the "dollar revaluation effect"). In the
majority of countries the time-variation of exchange-rate changes
account for most of time-variation of the gains from financial repression. This is confirmed by the decomposition of the variance
(over the sample for each country) of financial repression: on average the variance of the exchange-rate component is three times the
variance of the interest-differential component.28 We do not report
separate data on the dollar revaluation effect since it is small (less
than one-half of one percent) for most years and for all countries
if averaged over time. This is due to the fact that in the majority
of countries almost all foreign commercial debt is denominated in
dollars 29

The evidence in tables 4 and 5 is suggestive of the way financial repression works in practice. Domestic interest-rate ceilings
are maintained with high rates of currency depreciation and high
domestic inflation. With free capital markets, this source of revenue would be limited, since expectations of exchange-rate changes
would be reflected in the differential between domestic and foreign

interest rates. Table 6 reports information about the geographic
and time distribution of financial-repression tax revenue. The data
in the table should be interpreted cautiously, since the non-uniform
time coverage of the countries in the sample makes regional averages contain different time periods in different regions, while timeaverages contain different countries in different subperiods. Yet

table 6 seems to reveal a number of suggestive facts, worthy of
closer inspection in future research: financial repression appears
to be more relevant in African countries (excluding North Africa),
and least important in Asian countries. It is also much more evident in the recent years (1979—1987), than in the early part of the

sample. This last phenomenon is associated with the growth of
fiscal imbalances among LDCs in the 1980s.
In section 2.1 we showed that financial repression would not be

used by an optimizing government, if all the assumptions of the
28The results of this variance decomposition are available from us on request.

the World Bank DRS. Detailed data on the dollar revaluation effect are available on request.

Diamond-Mirrlees optimal tax problem are satisfied, and in particular if a government does not face costs in the use of certain types of
taxes. We also argued that in poorer countries these costs are likely
to be more significant; therefore taxes that distort production—
like financial repression—might be used more frequently. To verify
this proposition we compute the correlation between per-capita income and the revenue from financial repression.3° Figure 1 shows
cross-country correlation coefficients, computed for each year in
the sample-period. Once again, note that since the time-coverage
of each country differs, the number of elements in each year dif-

fers as well: for each year, the figure reports the sample size in
parenthesis.
The correlation between per capita income and financial-repression
tax revenue as a fraction of GDP tends to be positive, even though
it is very low for all years, except 1985. The correlation between
per-capita income and financial-repression tax revenue as a percentage of total government revenue is instead often negative. The

latter is closer to our predictions, while the former is not. The
difference between the two histograms is in part explained by the
positive correlation between total tax revenue as a fraction of GDP
and per-capita income: with higher per-capita income total tax
revenue increases more than the revenue from financial repression, and therefore the financial-repression tax revenue accounts
for smaller fractions of total tax revenue.
To highlight the contribution of each country in Figures 2 and
3 we report scatter plots of time averages—which should also to
some extent dampen the effects of exchange-rate surprises. Figure
2 shows a positive but very small covariation of the revenue from
financial repression as a fraction of CDP and per-capita income,
while figure 3 show a negative covariation between the revenue
from financial repression as a fraction of total revenue and percapita GDP. On the whole, Figures 1 to 3 do not seem to indicate
the existence of a clearly-noticeable inverse relation between percapita income and financial-repression, even though we find that
the latter decreases somewhat in importance as a source of tax
revenue in richer countries. We would expect results that more

strongly support our predictions if the sample included industrial
countries.
The relationship between inflation and financial repression was
discussed in section 2.2. Here we report the correlations between
the financial-repression tax revenue and both inflation and changes
in nominal exchange rates. As shown in figures 4 and 5, the correlations are all positive, except for the years 1984 and 1985. A
comparison of the two figures seems to suggest that the revenue
from financial repression is however more highly correlated with

the change in the nominal exchange rate than with the rate of
inflation.31

Figures 6 and 7 report the scatter plot of the time-averages.
The figures show the presence of two outliers: Mexico and Brazil.
In the former country both inflation and the revenue from finan-

cial repression are very high; in the latter country the inflation
rate is very high but the revenue from financial repression is lower
than in the rest of the sample. The Mexico data cover the period
1984—1987, during which there were extensive trade and foreign exchange controls. The very high government revenues from financial
repression in the last two years of this period follow the drop in oil
prices in 1985. They are due to the substantial and largely unanticipated inflation and exchange-rate devaluation.32 The Brazil data
cover the period 1983—1987. They reflect the flexible exchange
rate regime, as well as the sophistication of the country's financial
markets.33 The combination of high inflation and low financial repression in Brazil is suggestive of the difficulties of rasing revenue
from financial repression in countries where markets are relatively
free and surprise exchange-rate devaluations are not possible. This
31 An

issue we have not addressed directly is the correlation of financial repression with the
real exchange rate, that is the nominal exchange rate corrected for the relative price levels.

The reason for this omission is that, in the absence of short run "surprises" in exchange-rate
changes, we have no strong theoretical priors about what this correlation should be. Ofcourse,
when exchange—rate surprises are taken into account, we expect this correlation to be high
due to short—run price stickiness, and the fact that financial repression is correlated with the
nominal exchange rate. Indeed, we have found that the year-to-year variation of financial
repression is relatively highly correlated with the change in the real exchange rate. When we
compute time-averages, we find that the cross-country correlation of financial repression and
the change in the real exchange rate is about 30 percent—for both measures of revenue.
32See Easterly (1989). He finds that the total tax on financial intermediation was 2 percent
of GDP in 1985, and 9 percent in 1986.
33See, for example, Ghosh (1990) for a description of financial markets in Brazil.

18

high elasticity of the, financial repression tax base to the tax rate,
would manifest itself at very high rates of inflation—as we argued
above in section 2.2.
Finally, to illustrate the extent to which domestic interest rates
do not reflect subsequent exchange-rate changes we plot in figure
10 the cross-country correlations between interest-rate differentials
(dollar interest rates on foreign debt minus domestic currency interest rate on domestic debt) and exchange rate changes (percent
increase in the price of the dollar in domestic currency terms). If
domestic interest rates were allowed to reflect expectations about
exchange changes, and these expectations were on average correct,
this correlation should be negative, and close to -1. We find instead
that over many years in the 1970s the correlation is positive and
rather large. It turns negative, and close to -1 in the 1980s, in part
because of the inclusion of an outlier, Brazil, whose experience is
discussed above.

5 Summary and Concluding Remarks
This paper has presented an exploratory analysis of the theoretical underpinnings and the empirical relevance of the phenomenon
of financial repression from a public-finance perspective. We have
shown that financial repression is not an efficient policy when coun-

tries face no constraints in the use of different forms of taxation.
However, whenever there are costs of administering certain types
of taxes or whenever income distribution becomes an objective of
the government, an implicit tax on domestic financial markets may
be part of an optimal taxation program. We also argued that there
should be complementarities between the financial-repression tax
and the inflation tax. Throughout, we relied on explicit open economy assumptions, and stressed the interactions of capital controls
and financial repression.
Our empirical investigation suggests that the revenue from financial repression can be quite substantial: the unweighted crosscountry average is about 2 percent of GDP and 9 percent of total government revenue (excluding the revenue from financial repression), but varies significantly across countries. Hence, reforms
19

aimed at liberalizing financial markets and removing capital controls will in many countries pose the following questions: what is

the size of the budgetary impact of the liberalization, and how
can the revenue shortfall resulting from the liberalization be dealt
with?
We also uncovered convincing evidence of some complementarity between inflation and financial repression: in general countries
with higher rates of inflation, and therefore higher rates of currency
depreciation, tend to raise more revenue from financial repression.
This occurs because the relative costs of domestic borrowing is
influenced by the rate of depreciation of the domestic currency,
since domestic nominal interest rates are normally fixed administrat ively.

This prima-facic evidence on the quantitative importance of
financial repression opens in our view important questions for research and policymaking. First, it would be useful to carry out a
theoretical assessment and empirical estimation—based on generalequilibrium analysis—of the production distortions generated by
financial repression. Second, from the policymakers' viewpoint, it
is important to identify, at the country level, those reforms of tax
systems that would replace financial repression with more efficient
means of raising revenue.

Appendix A Data Sources
In order to achieve maximum cross-country comparability, we try
to use the same statistical sources. Calculations of the foreign cost
of borrowing are based on external debt statistics from the World
Bank Debtor Reporting System. To the extent possible, stocks of
central government domestic debt and holdings of these stocks by
the monetary authorities and deposit money banks are taken from
the IMF Government Financial Statistics (GFS). This is possible
for 8 countries, and the preferred concept of consolidated central
government is used for all these countries except Jordan, where
only budgetary data are available. GFS data on total interest payments are broken down into their foreign and domestic components
by locating a country-specific source with this information. Total
interest payments from this country source approximate, but do
not always equal, the GFS total.
For another 7 countries, country-specific data on the domestic
debt stock are quite close—within ten percent—to GFS data, and
the domestic interest payments used are consistent with this debt
stock. For another 6 countries, domestic debt stocks are significantly different—more than ten percent—from GFS data (higher
for 3 and lower for 3) but are the only central government domestic
debt figures for which associated interest payments could be identified. Finally, GFS has no data on domestic debt for 3 countries
(Algeria, Mexico and Portugal) and therefore direct comparison
with GFS standard definitions is not possible. Again, budgetary
data are occasionally used when consolidated accounts, which include social security and extra-budgetary funds, are not available.
Country-specific sources for these data and central government revenues are shown in Appendix B. Data on GDP, population, and
the GDP deflator are also taken from GFS, and exchange rates are
from the IMF Internationai Financial Statistics.
Below we describe in detail the calculations performed to obtain
the government revenue from financial repression, and the sources
used for each country. For each country we prepared a worksheet,
whose columns contain the years for which data is available, and
rows contain the items reported below.
