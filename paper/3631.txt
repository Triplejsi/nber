HABIT PERSISTENCE AND DURABILITY
IN AGGREGATE CONSUMPTION:
EMPIRICAL TESTS

ABSTRACT
Habit persistence in consumption preferences and durability
of consumption goods are two hypotheses which imply
time-nonseparability in the derived utility for consumption

expenditures. We study a simple model with both effects, in
which lagged consumption expenditures enter the Euler equation.
Habit persistence implies that the coefficients on the lagged
expenditures are negative, while durability implies positive

coefficients. If both effects are present, then estimating the
sign of the coefficients addresses the question as to which of

the two effects is dominant. Earlier empirical work on monthly

data supported the durability of consumption expenditures. We
estimate and test the Euler equation using monthly, quarterly and
annual data and find evidence that habit persistence dominates
the effect of durability.

1. Introduction
The consumption-based asset pricing model tested by Hansen and
Singleton (1982, 1983), Ferson (1983), Grossman, Melino and Shiller (1987),
Breeden, Gibbons and Litzenberger (1989) and others was derived under the
assumptions that the utility function is time and state separable and that

the consumption good is nondurable. Habit persistence in consumption
preferences and durability of consumption goods both imply time
nonseparability in the derived utility for consumption expenditures.
We illustrate the combined effects of durability in consumption
expenditures and of habit persistence in preferences, using a simple
theoretical model in which the durable good depreciates exponentially. Habit

persistence is modelled by assuming that a consumers subsistence level is a
weighted sum of the past flows of consumption services. In this model, both
current and lagged consumption expenditures enter the Euler equation. Habit
persistence implies that the coefficients on the lagged expenditures are
negative, while durability implies positive coefficients. If both effects
are present, then the sign of the coefficients indicates which of the two
effects is dominant.

In earlier work, Dunn and Singleton (1986), Eichenbaum, Hansen and
Singleton (1988) and Eichenbaum and Hansen (1988) estimated a positive
coefficient on lagged consumption in Euler equations for monthly data. They
interpreted their results as evidence of durability in consumption

expenditures. These studies used lagged consumption and returns as the
predetermined information variables in the model.
We find that the results for monthly data are sensitive to the
experimental design; in particular, to the choice of the instrumental

3

variables. The evidence for durability is not robust. The signs of the
coefficients on the lagged consuniptions are no longer significantly

positive, or they become negative when we experiment with different

instrument sets. We argue that alternative instruments are preferable to
those used in earlier studies and conclude that the effect of habit
persistence dominates the effect of durability in monthly consumption
expenditures.

We extend the investigation to quarterly and annual data and find
evidence that habit persistence dominates durability at these frequencies as
well. The evidence of habit persistence at the quarterly and annual
frequencies is robust to the choice of instrumental variables. It is
possible that durability of consumption expenditures has a sufficiently
short half-life, in which case it is suppressed in the quarterly and annual

data. Then habit persistence is more easily detected in the quarterly and
annual data, provided that habit persists for longer than a quarter or year.
In a calibration exercise to explain Mehra and Prescott's (1985) equity
premium puzzle, Constantinides (1989) found evidence that habit persists for
longer than a year.

Our results are reinforced by the recent work of Hansen and Jagannathan
(1990) and Gallant, Hansen and Tauchen (1989), who study the moment

inequality restrictions implied by the Euler equations. Winder and Palm
(1989) estimate a linearized form of the Euler equation and find support for

habit persistence in the Netherlands. Heaton (1990) considers an explicit
consumption process, assumes that the interest rate is constant and formally
models the time-averaging of monthly and quarterly consumption data in a
linearized version of the Euler equation. He finds evidence for short-

4
lived durability in consumption expenditures and some evidence for habit

persistence. Backus, Gregory and Telmer (1990) find that habit persistence
helps to account for the variability of expected returns on currencies.

The paper is organized as follows. The model is stated and the Euler
equation which incorporates nonseparable preferences and durability of

consumption expenditures is derived in section 2. The methodology is
presented in section 3. In section 4 we discuss the monthly, quarterly, and
annual consumption expenditures data, the asset returns data and the
predetermined instrumental variables. The main empirical, results, presented

in Tables 3-6 are discussed in section 5. The robustness of the empirical
results is further examined in section 6. In section 7 we reconsider the
equity premium puzzle. In the concluding section 8 we offer suggestions for
future work. An appendix illustrates the interpretation of the concavity
parameter of the representative utility function under time-nonseparability.

We argue that the parameter more closely approximates the risk aversion
coefficient than the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of
substitution.

2. The Xodel
We consider a single-good economy in discrete time. Expenditures on

the good at time t

by a representative consumer are denoted by c. The

good is durable and durability is modelled as in Dunn and Singleton (1986),
Eichenbaum, Hansen and Singleton (1988), and Eichenbaum and Hansen (1988).

a power of the difference between the consumption flow at time t

In the case of time separable preferences over consumption services (h —

0) the concavity parameter A is the relative risk aversion coefficient
(RRA) and the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. With
habit persistence (h >

0) we show in the appendix that the parameter A

approximately equals the RRA coefficient but may differ substantially from
the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

persistence based on one lag in consumption, in the absence of durability; or
it captures durability of one period only, in the absence of habit
persistence. The two-lag model captures habit persistence based on two lags
in consumption, in the absence of durability; or it captures durability of
two periods, in the absence of habit persistence; or it captures habit
persistence based on one lag in consumption and durability of one period.

3. Nethodology
The Euler equation is tested and the model parameters are estimated using

Hansen's (1982) Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Equation (8) defines an

error term uj for each asset i, i—l,. ..,N, such that Et[uj(t+l)] —

0,

where E[.] denotes the conditional expectation given information at time t.

With a set of L instruments,

t, we obtain E(u1Izt] — 0

j—l,...,L, known to the market at time

and therefore E[u+i z — 0, where u+ is

the vector of N error terms and z is the vector of L instruments. Given N

assets and L instruments there are NL orthogoriality conditions. The GMM

estimates are based on minimizing the quadratic form g'Wg where g is the

9

NL vector of the elements of (l/T)

U1 z

and W is the inverse of a

consistent estimate of the covariance matrix of these orthogonality

conditions. Hansen (1982) discussed the weighting matrix W and provided
conditions under which the parameter estimates are consistent and
asymptotically normal and the minimized value of the quadratic form is
asymptotically chi-square under the null hypothesis. The model is
overidentified provided that the number of orthogonality conditions, NL,

exceeds the number of parameters. The minimized quadratic form provides a
test statistic for the goodness-of-fit of the model; the number of degrees of
freedom is the difference between the number of orthogonality conditions and

the number of parameters. The parameters are fl,A,(b).

In the time-separable model u is a function of the variables Rt, cr1,
and ct, which are known at time t. The Euler equation therefore implies that

E(u+5Iu]_O, s1, and we say that u follows an MA(0) process. The time
separable model implies the null hypothesis,

H0: b — 0,

s

In the one-lag model (b —

c1, c

1, with an MA(O) error term u.

0,

s

2), u is a function of R, c2,

and c1. Since c1 is not in the time t information set,

the model does not imply that E[u÷iIu] — 0

E(u+5lu1_O. s

but implies that

2. We say that u in this case follows an MA(l)

process. In general, the model implies that the error term u will be MA(q),
where q is the smallest number such that
therefore implies the hypothesis,

for all j>q. The one-lag model

The autocorrelation of the error term under Ha is related to the parameter

in a complex way. The weighting matrix is adjusted to account for the moving
average terms, as described by Hansen (1982). When b1 is zero, the model
implies that the aucocorrelation of the error becomes zero, hence the null
hypothesis H0.

We model the consumer's decisions at fixed intervals, and we measure asset
returns and consumption over the same intervals. Consumption decisions may

actually occur more frequently. If the decisions are made within the
observation interval and the measured consumption expenditures are the sum of
the expenditures over the interval, then the consumption data are said to be
time-aggregated. Formally modelling time-aggregation in the Euler equation is
difficult and results for time-aggregation are only available in the
literature, imposing a first-order approximation to the marginal utility
function. We conduct several experiments Co asses the likely importance of
time-aggregation for our results.1

Using a linear approximation to the Euler equation, it can be shown that

one effect of time-aggregation is to increase the order of the MA process

followed by u.2 Therefore, under time aggregation, the residuals may
appear to behave like an FIA(l) process even if the nonseparability parameter

b1 is zero. Time-aggregation can also induce a spurious correlation between

the error terms and the information set for time t. Therefore, variables in

the market's information set at t which were not in the market's
information set at t - 1

E[u÷i] — 0.

may not be valid instruments for the equation

11

Time aggregation is not the only feature of the aggregate Consumption data

which creates methodological problems. Other features of the data could
induce autocorrelation in the error terms and spurious correlation between

the error terms and the instruments. Examples include imperfect timing and
interpolation of the consumption data, measurement errors and seasonal
adjustment. A rejection of H0 could be interpreted as evidence that these

other features of the data are important, rather than evidence that b1 is not
zero. We therefore examine the modified null hypothesis,

H0': b1—O, with an MA(l) error term u,

against the alternative hypothesis Ha We further asses the sensitivity of
our results to these data issues by conducting experiments in which the order
of the MA process of the errors is varied and in which the instruments for
the information set at time t

either

admit or do not admit the most recent

lagged values of the variables.

The parameter estimates and statistical tests using the GMM are justified
from asymptotic distribution theory. There is a natural concern about the

properties of these procedures in small samples. Tauchen (1986) and
Kocherlakota (1990) provided simulation evidence for the time-separable
model. Tauchen found that the test statistics perform well with as few as 50
annual observations, although he found a slight tendency to reject the model
too infrequently. Kocherlakota (1990), using a different set of parameter

values, found cases where the model is rejected too often. When the tests
exploit only unconditional moment restrictions, i.e., when the instrument is
a constant vector of ones (a case we examine below), he found that the test

12

statistics perform well in small samples. Both of these studies found that
the coefficient estimates and their standard errors can be unreliable in
small samples.

Although we report the coefficient estimates and their asymptotic standard
errors, we stress that the reliability of these estimates cannot be assessed
until simulation studies of the finite sample properties of the CMM become
available for nonseparable consumption models. We therefore refrain from
deriving detailed implications from the models which depend on the point
estimates of the coefficients.

Ferson and Foerster (1990) studied the finite sample properties of the GMM
in a linear asset pricing context with cross-equation restrictions. They
found that a two-stage CMM approach, as described in Hansen and Singleton
(1982), tends to reject the model too often in larger systems, while an
iterated GHN approach provides more accurate test statistics. We use an
iterated GMM approach in this study.3

4. The Data
We study the returns of Treasury bills, bonds and value-weighted

portfolios of common stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The
stocks are grouped into size deciles, based on the market value of equity
outstanding at the beginning of each year. We examine a subset of the 10
deciles: deciles 1,5. and 10. Decile 1 represents the common stocks of small
firms, and decile 10 represents large firms. Three portfolios are chosen to
keep the number small, while capturing most of the stock return behavior that
would be reflected in a design using all ten deciles or using value- and

13

equally-weighted stock indices. We include a long-term government bond return
and the return to a strategy of rolling over one-month Treasury bills. Thus,

a total of 5 portfolio returns are examined. All of the asset return data are
from the Center for Research in Security Prices of the University of Chicago
(CRSP) -

Our primary measure of consumption is real, per capita expenditures on
consumer nondurable goods. These data are seasonally adjusted by the Commerce
Department, using the X-ll seasonal adjustment program. The quarterly data

are in real terms, as reported by Data Resources Inc. (DRI). The annual
consumption data are from the Commerce Department's Business Statistics, 1959
edition, and DRI.4

Monthly data are obtained from Citibase. The real

expenditure totals are divided by the population to obtain the per capita
real consumption series. The population figure is the total United States
residential population (excluding armed forces abroad) from Statistical
Abstract of the U.S., DRI, and Citibase.

We examine data for durable goods expenditures and for seasonally
unadjusted consumption in some experiments. The seasonally unadjusted data
are the quarterly nominal expenditures from DRI, divided by the population
and deflated by a seasonally unadjusted component of the consumer price index
(CPI)

The real asset returns are the nominal returns deflated by the price
deflator for the measure of consumption in a given model. For example, when
we use nondurable goods expenditure data we deflate the asset returns by the
deflator for consumer nondurable goods. When we use the seasonally unadjusted
consumer durables expenditure data, we deflate the returns by the seasonally
unadjusted consumer price index for consumer durables.

14

The earlier studies of Dunn and Singleton (1986), Eichenbaum, Hansen and
Singleton (1988) and Eichenbaum and Hansen (1988) used monthly consumption

data to explore time-nonseparable models. We focus mostly on the quarterly
and annual data. Monthly consumption data are suspect for at least two
reasons. First, measurement error which can induce negative serial
autocorrelation in consumption growth, is likely to be proportionately more

important in monthly data. Second, components of the monthly consumption
expenditures are calculated by interpolation, which may induce positive

serial autocorrelation. Durability of consumption expenditures induces
negative autocorrelation in consumption growth. For example, a consumer
purchasing an automobile in one period is likely to refrain from purchasing

another automobile for several periods. Habit persistence induces positive
autocorrelation in consumption growth since the consumer maximizes utility by
smoothing consumption more than would be optimal with time-separable

preferences. Therefore, spurious positive (negative) autocorrelation in
consumption growth may lead to the erroneous conclusion that durability of
consumption expenditures dominates (is dominated by) habit persistence.
Previous studies of consumption-based models have used lagged values of
consumption and returns as instruments to estimate the parameters and test

the Euler equation. However, as discussed above, measurement errors and other
data problems can result in spurious correlation between the consumption and
real returns and their lagged values. The spurious correlation can lead to
spurious rejections of the Euler equations and can bias the parameter

estimates. We use lagged consumption and returns in some experiments for
comparison purposes, and to. check the sensitivity of our results. However, we

focus mostly on instruments that are distinct from the lagged

15

values, but which can predict both asset returns and measures of consumption
growth. Such instruments should provide powerful tests of the Euler equation
restrictions. The instrumental variables are summarized in Figure 1.

VWYLD(-l)

common

stocks

is

the average dividend yield on a value-weighted index of

traded on the New York stock exchange, provided by CRSP. The

dividend yield is the sum

of the

most recent year's dividends divided by the

price level on the last trading day of the quarter. The symbol (-1) indicates
that a variable is lagged one period relative to the date of the asset return
realization in the Euler equation. For example, the dividend yield used to

predict returns for the first quarter uses the price level at the end of the
previous December and dividends over the previous year. Using the annual
dividends avoids the seasonality of dividend payments. Dividend yields are a
component of the return of stocks, so the ex-ante dividend yield is a natural

instrument for capturing variation in expected stock returns. Campbell and
Shiller (1988), Cutler, Poterba and Summers (1988), Fama

and

French (1988),

and others found that dividend yields predict future stock and bond returns.
The symbol (-2) indicates that a variable is lagged two periods.

DIVDIFF(-l) is the dividend yield of the CRSP equally-weighted stock
index less the dividend yield of the value-weighted stock index. Movements in

this

variable over time reflect the differences between the dividend yields

of small and large firms. We find that the difference contributes additional
explanatory power, given the level of the yield, in regressions for the
future returns and consumption measures.

16

TBIMO(-l) is the nominal, one-month Treasury bill rate. The ability of
short-term bills to predict monthly returns of bonds and stocks is documented
by Fama and Schwert (1977) and others.

Pl(-l) is a measure of the detrended price level for the smallest decile
of common stocks. This is the inverse of the price index level, relative to
the average level over the preceding twelve months. Keim and Stambaugh (1986)
studied a similar variable and found that it predicts both bond and stock
returns. This variable may capture the reversion of expected returns to their
long-run means. Mean reversion implies that if stock returns are below
average (so that prices are relatively low), then conditional expected
returns are higher than average.

CIPX(-l) is the continuously-compounded annual growth rate of an index of
U.S. industrial production, lagged one quarter.

SSLOPE(-l) is the three-month Treasury bill rate, less the one-month
return of a one-month bill. This is one of three instruments which decompose
risky debt yields into short-term and long-term default-free slope variables,

and an ex ante default premium for corporate debt. Fama (1984), Campbell
(1987), and Stanibaugh (1988) found that short term measures of the term

structure can predict bond returns of different maturities and stock returns.

LSLOPE(-l) is the long-term slope, measured as the lagged value of the
yield-to-maturity of Aaa corporate bonds, less the one-month Treasury bill
rate.

CBPREX(-1) is the lagged value of the average monthly yield-to-maturity of
corporate bonds rated Baa by Moody's Investor Services, less the lagged value
of the Aaa corporate bond yield. Keim and Starnbaugh (1986) found that a yield
spread has predictive power for bond and stock returns.

17

The predetermined variables follow empirical studies which document their
ability to predict the returns of portfolios similar to the ones we study.

Statistical inference is complicated if the variables are the result of
collective "data snooping" by a series of researchers. We do not attempt to
formally account for these effects in our analysis.6

Tables 1 and 2 present summary statistics for the basic data. The sample
period of the quarterly analysis is 1948-1986; the annual data are for 1929-

1986; monthly data cover 1959-1986. For annual data we use a subset of the
instrumental variables. These are VWYLD, DIVDIFF, TB1MO, P1 and SSLOPE.

Table 1 shows that some of the autocorrelations of the instruments are above
0.9 (the quarterly CBPREM. VWYLD, DIVDIFF and TBIMO, and also GIPX in monthly

data). In the case of WYLD AND DIVDIFF, this is expected given the
overlapping nature of the numerators. GIPX is an annual growth rate. The
autocorrelations decay toward zero at longer lags for all of the variables.

Table 2 shows the contemporaneous correlations among the instruments. The
correlations suggest that none of the instruments are redundant and that
multicollinearity should not be a problem. Only three (two) of the
correlations among the quarterly (annual) instruments exceed 0.5, and the
largest is 0.67 (0.69). In monthly data, five of the correlations exceed 0.5
and the largest is 0.74.

insert tables 1 and 2 here

We examine time-series regressions, using the instruments to predict the
future returns of the common stock and bond portfolios and the future growth
rates of consumption. The asset returns are measured in excess of the three-

18

month Treasury bill return.7 These regressions suggest that the instruments
should allow us to construct powerful tests of the Euler equation. The signs

and magnitudes of the coefficients on the asset returns are consistent with
earlier studies. For example, VWYLD(-1) enters with a positive coefficient
and TB1MO enters with a negative coefficient in each of the regressions. The
R-squares (right-tail probability values) for the quarterly sample range from
0.12 (0.02) to 0.26 (0.00) across the portfolio returns. In annual
regressions, the range is from 0.12 (0.29) to 0,48 (0.00). In monthly data,

the range is from 0.06 (0.01) to 0.11 (0.00). The instruments seem to
capture changing expected excess returns in both the bond and stock markets.
The instruments are less strongly related to the growth rates of future

consumption expenditures. The R-squares in regressions predicting the growth
of nondurables consumption expenditures are 0.09 ,

0.12,

and 0.02,

respectively, in quarterly, annual and monthly data. The corresponding righttail probability values are 0.09, 0.29, and 0.66. respectively.

5. Empirical Results

In Tables 3-6 we present the results of estimating and testing the models

using monthly, quarterly and annual consumption expenditures and returns

data. Since earlier work focussed on monthly data we examine first the

monthly data. We use five assets: the three common stock portfolios from
size deciles 1, 5 and 10; a long-terni government bond portfolio; and a onemonth Treasury bill.

insert table 3 here

19

In the first panel of Table 3 we present results using seven instruments:

a constant and three variables lagged once and twice relative to the date of

the realization of the five asset returns. The three variables used as
instruments are the real consumption growth over one month, the real return
of a one-month Treasury bill and the real one-month return of the small stock

portfolio. The errors u41 itt

the

Euler equation E(u+i] — 0

are assumed

to follow an MA(0) process in the time separable model and an MA(l)
process in the one-lag model.

In the first row of Table 3 the notation b1 — 0

states that the

nonseparability parameter is set equal to zero and we are then estimating and

testing the time separable model. The point estimate of the subjective
discount rate in this case is .993 and the estimate of the concavity

parameter A is 0.31. However, the right tail p-value for the goodness-of-fit
test is .006 and the model is rejected. Rejecting this model is consistent
with the earlier conclusions of Hansen and Singleton (1982) and others.

In the second row of Table 3 the nonseparability parameter b1 is
unrestricted and is estimated along with the parameters $

and

A.8

The

model is not rejected by the goodness-of-fit test, the p-value being .15.

The subjective discount rate is very close to one and the concavity parameter

is A — 2.1.

As we argue in the Appendix, in the nonseparable model the

concavity parameter is approximately equal to the RRA coefficient but may
differ substantially from the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of

substitution in consumption. The point estimate of the nonseparability

parameter b1 is positive and significantly different from zero. Taking the
result at face value, it provides evidence that durability of consumption
expenditures dominates the effect of habit persistence in a one-lag model,

consistent with the earlier findings of Dunn and Singleton (1986),
Eichenbauxn, Hansen and Singleton (1988) and Eichenbaum and Hansen (1990).

However, this result is not robust.

In the lower portion of panel 1, Table 3, we replace the lagged
consumption and return instruments by a constant and the lagged financial

variables summarized in figure 1. The point estimate of b1 is now -0.72
and is significantly different from zero. The p-value of the goodness-of-fit
test is high, .347. These numbers suggest that the effect of habit
persistence dominates the effect of durability of consumption expenditures.

These results serve two purposes. First, they demonstrate that we can
replicate earlier results using our data sample. Second, they provide a
warning that the estimation of the nonseparability parameter is potentially
sensitive to the choice of instruments.

In panel 2 of Table 3 we exclude the first lagged values of the variables
from the set of instruments, using only the second lagged values. This

experiment can be motivated by concerns about measurement errors in the data,

publication lag or by time aggregation. In the first subpanel with

consumption and returns as instruments the point estimate of b1 is .065 and
the standard error is 227, providing no evidence that either habit
persistence or durability plays a dominant role. Moreover, the tests do not
reject the time-separable model. In the lower part of panel 2, using the
second lags of the financial variables as instruments, we estimate a negative

value of b1 which is nearly three standard errors from zero. The timeseparable model is strongly rejected by the goodness-of-fit test.

In panel 3 of Table 3 we repeat the experiment of panel 2, except that we
increase the order of the moving average process that is assumed for the

21

error terms. In the time-separable model (b1 — 0) we use an MA(l) assumption

and in the one-lag model we use an MA(2). The results are comparable to those
of panel 2. When lagged consumption and returns are the instruments the
estimate of b1 is close to zero and the time-separable model is not rejected.
When the lagged financial variables are the instruments the time-separable
model is rejected. The point estimate of b1 is negative and the timenonseparable model is not rejected.

We conclude from Table 3 that the evidence of durability in the monthly
consumption expenditures relies on using the most recent lagged values of the
endogenous variables as instruments. However, there are reasons to be
suspicious of results that rely on these instruments. The first lagged values
of consumption and returns are suspect, given the potential problems with
measurement errors, publication lag and time aggregation. In contrast,
whether we use the first or the second lags of the financial variables as
instruments, we estimate negative b1 coefficients, which suggests that habit
persistence dominates the effects of durability, Of course, given the
problems with monthly consumption data, evidence based on the monthly data is
not conclusive.

In Tables 4 and 5 we present results using quarterly and annual

consumption expenditures and returns. We use as instruments either the
financial variables lagged by one period, the financial variables lagged by
two periods or the consumption and return variables lagged by one and two

periods. Tables 4 and 5 summarize the results for the one-lag model. Table 4
presents quarterly data, assuming that decisions are made quarterly. In Table
5 we assume an annual decision interval and use annual data.

22

insert table 4 here

In Table 4, the results for quarterly data use two systems of asset

returns. The first system is similar to the monthly, five-asset system and
consists of the three size portfolios of stocks (deciles 1, 5 and 10), a
portfolio of long-term government bonds and a strategy of rolling over one-

month Treasury bills. In this system of asset returns the model is
challenged to explain the differences in the returns of conunon stocks grouped

by firm size, which have served as an acid test of the Capital Asset Pricing

Model. The second system consisting of just two assets, the Treasury bills
and the large stocks, directs attention to the differences in the return of
Treasury bills and stocks.

In panel 1 of Table 4 the instruments are a constant and the eight
financial variables lagged once relative to the date of the realization of
the asset returns. In panel 2 the financial instruments at lag two are used.
The point estimates of the parameter b1 all lie between - .95 and - .97 and
they are many standard errors away from zero. The goodness-of-fit tests
indicate a markedly improved fit when the nonseparability parameter is
included. The results suggest that the effects of habit persistence dominate
the effects of durability in the quarterly data.9

In the monthly data evidence of durability in consumption expenditures
emerged only when the first lagged values of the consumption and returns were
used as instruments. In panel 3 of Table 4 we replicate this experiment with

quarterly data. The results show that, merely by switching from monthly to
quarterly data, the evidence in favor of durability of consumption

23

expenditures disappears. For the five-asset system the coefficient b1 is
negative and statistically different from zero and for the two-asset system

the point estimate of b1 is negative but insignificantly different from
zero.

In Table 5 we repeat the tests reported in Table 4 with annual rather than

quarterly data. These results provide further evidence that the effects of
habit persistence dominate the effects of durability. All of the point
estimates of b1 are negative and the goodness-of-fit test results are

improved. The annual data,

of

course cover a longer sample period and may be

less influenced by measurement errors. Furthermore, results using the annual

data should not be affected by problems with the seasonality of consumption

expenditures and returns within the year)°
These results may be understood in terms of the time series properties of
consumption and the predictive ability of the different instruments for asset

returns and consumption. In monthly data, consumption growth rates are
negatively autocorrelated. In quarterly data the autocorrelation is closer to
zero and in annual data the autocorrelation is positive (see Table 1).
Positive autocorrelation in consumption combines with a negative
nonseparability parameter to raise the volatility of the intertemporal

marginal rate of substitution. This is one dimension along which habit
persistence improves the fit of the model in quarterly and annual data.
Negative autocorrelation in consumption combines with a positive

nonseparability parameter in a similar ways which suggests durability. Using
lagged consumption and returns as the instruments, the autocorrelation
properties of consumption are given more weight in the Euler restrictions.

Therefore, when we use monthly consumption data and lagged consumption

24

instruments, we find evidence for durability in monthly data.

When the lagged financial instruments are used in the Euler equation, the
predictive power is relatively higher for the asset returns, and lower for
the future consumption, than when lagged consumption growth rates and returns
are used as the instruments. Habit persistence tends to reduce the
intertemporal elasticity of substitution, which suggests relatively higher
volatility in expected returns relative to consumption changes. These effects
receive more weight in the Euler restrictions when the lagged financial
variables are the instruments. We therefore find evidence for habit
persistence, even in the monthly data, when the lagged financial variables
are used.

insert figure 2 here

Figure 2 illustrates the sensitivity of the one-lag model to the value of
the nonseparability parameter b1. The values of the objective function are
plotted, minimized over the choice of A and fi,

for

given values of b1. An

MA(l) weighting matrix is used. Results for annual data and five assets are
plotted. (Similar patterns are observed in the other cases.) The objective

function is highly nonlinear in the parameter b1. Typically, we find that
there is a local minimum in the region of durability (b1 >

0),

and there is a

"hill" in the objective function over which the algorithm must climb to

attain the global minimum in the habit persistence region <b1 <

0).

Table 6 reports tests of the hypothesis H', that the parameter b1 is
zero, allowing the error term to be KA(l), against the alternative that b1 is
not zero. Two test statistics are reported. The two statistics have the same

25

asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis, H'. One statistic is the
square of the t-ratio for the b1 parameter. The second test uses the approach
described in Eichenbaum, Hansen and Singleton (1988). The restricted system
(imposing b1—O) is estimated using the GMM weighing matrix from the
unrestricted system, allowing the MA(1) error structure. The difference
between quadratic forms using the restricted and the unrestricted objective
function is asymptotically distributed as a chi-square variate with one
degree of freedom.

insert table 6 here

Table 6 shows that the two statistics imply the same inferences, so there
is no signal of departures from the large-sample properties of the
statistics. The tests reject the null hypothesis H0' against Ha in three of
four cases. In the fourth case, the two asset system with annual data,
neither test can reject the null hypothesis. Overall, a negative value of the
nonseparability parameter is supported by the evidence.

insert figure 3 here

We find that direct estimation of the two-lag nonseparable model is
problematic. It is difficult to estimate both b1 and b2 with precision.
Figure 3 illustrates the problem. We establish a grid of values for b1 and
b2, in increments of 0.1. At each point in the grid we condition on these
values and we search for A and

to minimize the objective function. Figure 3

shows the right-tail probability value associated with the minimized value of

26

the objective function on the vertical axis, plotted against the specified
values of (-b1) on the x-axis and (-b2) on the relief axis. The figure
therefore provides a representation of the goodness-of-fit of the model for

particular values of the nonseparability parameters. An MA(2) weighting
matrix is used for every point on the grid. Results for the five-asset system

and quarterly data are shown. A point in the center of the x-relief plane
corresponds to the time-separable model (b1—0, b2—O). Moving toward the right
rear corner implies increasing durability and moving toward the left front
corner implies habit persistence. There is a "ridge," along which b1 and b2
add up to about -0.90, in the habit persistence region of the figure. The
value of the objective function is insensitive to the individual coefficients
b1 and b2. Therefore, the individual coefficients cannot be estimated

reliably. We found a similar result when we estimated the two-lag model with
annual data. Although our results suggest that habit persistence is
empirically relevant, the two coefficients cannot be estimated reliably.

Therefore, we cannot infer the half-life of habit persistence.

6. The Robustness of the Empirical Results
6.1 Seasonal Adjustment of Consumption
The estimates and test results reported in Tables 3-6 are based on
seasonally-adjusted data, as explained in section 4. The nonseparable models
imply that the flow of services and the subsistence level are averages of
lagged consumption expenditures. But seasonally-adjusted consumption data

have already been smoothed with the X-1l seasonal adjustment program. The
smoothing by X-ll could bias the tests and the estimates of the parameters.

27

The similarity of our findings using quarterly and annual data suggests
that the results are not driven by seasonality or by the particular seasonal
adjustment employed within the year. An appealing way to further verify that
the results are not sensitive to seasonal adjustment is to use unadjusted
quarterly expenditures data and to allow for seasonal variation in the
utility function as in Miron (1986), Ferson and Harvey (1990) and English,

Miron and Wilcox (1989). These studies introduced multiplicative "taste
shift" parameters which allowed the utility for a given level of consumption
to vary with the season. We attempted in some experiments to incorporate
seasonal taste shift parameters together with the nonseparability parameter
b1 in the model. We were unable to reliably estimate a model with the
additional parameters.

We report the results of a simple experiment which is less ambitious than

the above. We adopt a two-step approach. In the first step, we regress the
logarithm of unadjusted, quarterly real per capita consumption expenditures

on a time trend and dummy variables indicating the quarter. We take the
residuals from these regressions, add back the sample means and exponentiate.

The resulting consumption series is seasonally adjusted, but avoids the

moving averages used by X-ll)2 The procedure is similar to assuming
multiplicative seasonal taste shock parameters, as in Miron (1986). In the
second step, we use the dummy-adjusted data to estimate and test the Euler

equations (8) and (9). In principle, one would like to combine the two
steps; but the two-step approach does provide some indication of the
potential sensitivity of our findings to the method of seasonal adjustment.13

28

insert table 7 here

The results are summarized in Table 7 and are similar to Table 4. The

goodness of fit statistics imply that habit persistence improves the fit of
the model. The point estimates of the nonseparability parameter b1 are
negative and they are several standard errors from zero.

6.2 Expenditures on Durable Goods

The Commerce Department provides data on three groups of consumer
expenditures, which are labelled as durables, nondurables and services. Our
estimates and tests reported in sections 5 and 6.1 used the nondurables
series, excluding the durables and services. We recognized that the Commerce

department's nondurables series may in fact be durable, and we accounted for
the durability in the derivation of the nonseparable models. Our approach is
formally justified under the assumption that the consumer's preferences are
separable over the flow of services from the Commerce department's durables,
nondurables and services.

Dunn and Singleton (1986), Eichenbaum, Hansen and Singleton (1988), and
Eichenbauni and Hansen (1990) derived, estimated and tested Euler equations

for models with nonseparable preferences across goods. The degree of
substitution across the goods is parameterized. If we allow for such
preferences, which are both tiine-nonseparable and nonseparable across goods,

the number of parameters in the model becomes large.

insert table 8 here

29

In this section we adopt the maintained hypothesis that the preferences
are separable across goods and focus on the Euler equation implied by time-

nonseparable preferences, defined over the flow of services from the Commerce
department's durable goods expenditure series. Results for annual and
quarterly data (both X-ll and dummy adjusted versions) are reported in Table
8. One might expect b1 to be positive for consumer durables, but the point
estimates of b1 - -

- are

although

greater than the point estimates for nondurables

less than zero in all six cases. The goodness-of-fit tests indicate an

improved fit with the negative b1 coefficients. We conclude that our earlier
finding that habit persistence dominates durability is not due to the fact
that we excluded the consumption flows from the durable goods expenditure
series.

Figure 4 illustrates the sensitivity of the objective function to the
value of the nonseparability parameter b1, using durable goods expenditures.

The values of the objective function, minimized over the choice of A and ,

are plotted for fixed values of b1. Results for quarterly (X-ll adjusted)
data and all five assets are plotted. Similar patterns are observed in the
other cases, and the conclusion is similar to that obtained from figure 2.

Typically, however, a local minimum in the region of durability is closer to
the global minimum in the region of habit persistence, when durable goods
expenditures are used than when nondurables are used.

insert figure 4 here

Since the results for nondurable and durable goods are similar, it is
unlikely that the sum of the two would lead to different conclusions.

30

However, there are potential difficulties in the interpretation of the

experiments in Table 8 and Figure 4. If preferences are not separable across
durable and nondurable goods, then applying the model to data on durable

goods creates a missing variables problem. Because nondurables and durable
goods expenditures are correlated, the durable goods expenditures may proxy
for the missing nondurables expenditures. The estimates of the

nonseparability parameter may thus be biased toward habit persistence. A
multigood model could potentially control for this effect, although the
larger number of parameters will create econometric difficulties. We leave

for future research a complete study of the interaction between habit
persistence and the complementarity or substitutability of different
consumption goods.

7. The Equity Premium Revisited
Mehra and Prescott (1985) introduced the equity premium puzzle. They
considered a pure exchange economy in which the representative consumer has

time- and state-separable preferences with constant RRA coefficient. They
assumed that consumption growth is a two-state Markov process and calibrated
this process to match the sample mean, variance and first-order

autocorrelation of the annual growth rate of per capita consumption in the

years 1889-1978. They were unable to find a plausible pair of the subjective
discount rate and the RRA coefficient to match the sample mean of the annual
real rate of interest and of the equity (stock market) return over the same
90-year period.

The calibration exercise of Mehra and Prescott is not directly comparable

31

to the estimation and testing of Euler equations which we reported in the

earlier sections. Our starting point was a system of Euler equations:

Et(Ri(t+l) MRS÷11 — 1,

(10)

where Rj(t+l) is the one-plus-return on asset i over [t, t+1J and
MRS1 is the marginal rate of substitution between dates t and t + 1.
The Euler restrictions that we tested included in particular the
unconditional Euler equation:

EERi(t+l) MRS+i] —

1.

(11)

Using predetermined variables z as instruments, we included additional
implications of the Euler equation, specifically:

E[Rj(t+l) MRSt+llz.tJ —

I

.

(12)

Including the predetermined instruments, our estimates of the RRA coefficient
were reasonable in magnitude, for both the time separable and the

nonseparable models. In contrast. Mehra and Prescott found that a large RRA
coefficient is implied by the mean equity premium.

insert table 9 here

Hansen and Singleton (1983) and Ferson and Harvey (1990) observed that

when the Euler equation with b1—0 is estimated using only unconditional
moments, large but imprecise estimates of the risk aversion coefficient are
found. In Table 9 we repeat the tests of Tables 4, 5, 7 and 8 using a
constant as the only instrument. The five-asset system is examined, because
the two-asset systems are not overidentified. The estimates of the concavity

32

parameter A are typically larger than in the previous tables. Using
nondurable goods the estimates of b1 are negative in two of the three
experiments, which suggests habit persistence. Using durable goods
expenditures all three point estimates are positive, which suggests

durability in expenditures. However, none of the estimates in Table 9 are
precise and the goodness of fit statistics do not indicate an improved fit

when we allow for nonseparable preferences)4
In what sense then, does habit persistence explain the equity premium

puzzle, as claimed in Constantinides (1989)? To provide an answer to this

question, consider adding a mean preserving spread e÷1

Ri(t÷l) as R.(t÷l) +

e1,

to the asset return

where E(e+i] — 0 and E[e+i MRS+I1

—

0.

If equation (10) holds, so does the equation

EtE(Ri(t+l) +

ei)

—

MRSt+i]

1

(13)

.

This implies that conditional and unconditional tests of the Euler equation

do not focus on the variance of asset returns. Likewise, matching the
variance of the equity premium was not one of the goals addressed by Mehra
and Prescott (1985).
By contrast, Cotistantinides' (1990) goal was to match both the mean and

the variance of the equity premium. He demonstrated that habit persistence
improves upon time separable preferences. The mean equity premium is

driven

by the ERA coefficient rather than the elasticity of substitution in

consumption. As we demonstrate in the Appendix, habit persistence has a
second-order effect on the ERA coefficient and, predictably, does not improve

significantly on the mean equity premium. The variance of the equity premium
is driven by the elasticity of substitution in consumption. As we

33

demonstrate in the Appendix, habit persistence decreases substantially the

elasticity of substitution and implies that a small variance of consumption
growth is associated with a large variance of the equity premium.

In Table 10 we provide additional evidence on this issue. We repeat the
tests of Table 4, but we replace the real return of the Treasury bill in the

Euler equation with the real return plus a parameter L. This parameter
allows the unconditional mean return of the bill, and therefore the mean
excess return or premium of an asset relative to the bill, to be

unrestricted. Any rejection of this model will not be driven by an inability
to fit the mean bill return. The L parameter can be interpreted as a pricing
error, similar to a "Jensen's alpha" in the Capital Asset Pricing Model, or
as a liquidity premium on the bill return that is not captured by the model.

insert table 10 here

Table 10 shows that the point estimates of L are positive and, in the two-

asset system, are significantly different from zero. This implies that the
average bill return which best fits the model is higher than the historical
average return, consistent with the pattern in Mehra and Prescott (1985). But
the goodness-of-fit tests and the estimates of b1 do not change much from the
results in Table 4. Thus, the tests are not highly sensitive to the average
level of the interest rate. This supports the interpretation that habit
persistence improves the fit of the model largely through its effect on
moments other than the mean equity premium.15

34

8. suggestions for Future Research
Our study suggests several avenues for future research. One extension is a
multiple-good model, which may provide further evidence on substitution
across consumption goods in the presence of habit persistence and durability.
Such a model could potentially identify the separate effects, but our results
suggest that more complex specifications will be econometrically challenging.

Further work is required to better understand the relation of seasonality and
habit persistence. Another challenge is to model several frequencies of
consumption and asset holding period returns simultaneously. Such an approach
is potentially promising, given the different time-series properties of asset
returns and consumption over different holding periods and given our evidence
which suggests nonseparabilities that operate at different frequencies.

35

APPENDIX
With habit persistence and/or durability the RRA coefficient and the
intertemporal elasticity of substitution depend on the parameters of the

probability distribution of the asset returns. With plausible assumptions on
the parameters of the probability distribution, Constantinides (1990) proved

that the RRA coefficient approximately equals the parameter A and that the
intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption can be substantially

lower than the inverse of the relative risk aversion coefficient. These
insights are important in the interpretation of our empirical findings and
are illustrated here in the context of a simple deterministic economy.

We assume that the investment opportunity set consists of just one asset

which is riskiess and has (one plus) rate of return R each period. The
representative consumer's preferences are the special case of the preferences

conclude that the RRA coefficient approximately equals the parameter A and

Whereas the product equals one in the absence of habit persistence (h —

habit persistence drives a wedge between the RRA coefficient and the inverse

may be substantially below one.

FOOTNOTES

I. Heaton (1990) studies monthly data using a first order approximation of
the Euler equation in this paper. He uses lagged consumption and dividends
as the information set and he models time-aggregation. Heaton finds evidence
for both durability and habit persistence in monthly expenditures. His
evidence suggests that the half-life of durability is relatively short and
that habit persistence dominates durability at horizons beyond about two
months. These results are consistent with our estimates of b1, which
suggests that the effects of time-aggregation are not a very important factor
in the estimates.
2. Given a linear approximation time aggregation increases the order of the
MA process by one. In the general, nonlinear Euler equation the results of
time-aggregation can be more complex.

3. Specifically, we construct the weighting matrix W using the parameter
estimates from the n-th stage, use this matrix to find parameters for stage
n + I which minimize the quadratic form, and then use the new parameters to
update the weighting matrix. The iterations continue until a minimum value
of the quadratic form is obtained.
4. The annual data for 1929-49 are spliced into the annual sums of the
quarterly Commerce department data, in real, per capita terms, using 1949
levels as the splicing factor.

5. Price deflators for personal consumption expenditures are only available
to us in seasonally adjusted form. We use the seasonally unadjusted
components of the CPI for consumer nondurable goods to deflate the nominal
nondurables expenditure totals, and the CPI for consumer durables to deflate
the durable goods expenditures. In other experiments, we used the overall
CPI as the deflator for both categories, and the results were similar.
6. See Lo and MacKinlay (1990) for an analysis of data snooping in financial
models. Note that if there is spurious predictability, then it will be
difficult for the Euler equation to "explain" this predictability. Such a
bias is conservative, given our result that habit persistence helps to
explain the predictability through the Euler equation.
7. Deflated returns produce similar results.

8. The GMM

estimate of b

minimizes a quadratic form which is infinite for

< 0. Our estimates of b1
and undehned for c + b1c
c + b1c esure ta the argument of the utility function, c + b1c1, is positive
—0

at all dates. In our quarterly (annual, monthly) sample the minimum ratio
is 0.98 (0.92, .975), verifying that the argument of the utility
(c /c
fucton is positive at all dates and for all point estimates of b1
presented in Tables 3-6.

9. We repeated the tests in panel 2, except that we used an MA(l) assumption
for the error terms in the time separable model and an MA(2) assumption in
the one-lag, nonseparable model. The point estimates of the parameters are
very similar but the standard errors are typically larger. The goodness-off it statistics are typically smaller than in panel 2. For example, the time
separable model is not longer rejected in the five-asset system (the pvalue is 0.44) but it is rejected in the two-asset system (p-value— 0.006).
The one-lag, nonseparable model is not rejected. Including additional moving
average terms, when the autocorrelations are not significant, implies that
the estimate of the covariance matrix of the orthogonality conditions will be
noisier. We would expect this to reduce the efficiency of the estimates and
the power of the goodness-of-fit tests.
10. We repeated the tests in panel 2, using the financial variables at lag
two as instruments, but we used alternative moving average assumptions for
the error terms (i.e. MA(l) for the time-separable and MA(2) for the one-lag
model. These experiments show that the results are robust. In the five-asset
system the point estimate of b1 is -0.87 (standard error 0.03). However, none
of the models can be rejected y the goodness-of-fit statistics and the
standard errors of the coefficients are often larger than in table 5.
11. Even is the absence of durability two parameters (h and a) determine the
half-life of habit persistence. Three parameters would be needed to isolate
the separate effects of durability and habit persistence.
12. The seasonally adjusted consumption levels are given by
c exp(y'(D - Dr]), where c is the unadjusted consumption, -y is a vector of
three shift parameters reiahve to the first quarter, Dt is a vector of dummy
variables for quarters 2-4 and D is the vector of sample means of the dummy
variables.
13. Miron (1986) included a time-squared term in his regressions for the log
of consumption. In a previous version of this paper we followed Miron by
including the squared term. Our results using this alternative series were
very similar to those reported in Tables 7, 8 and 9.
14. We replicated the tests in Table 6 using only a constant as the
instrument and we are unable to reject the hypothesis that b1 is zero.

15. Singleton (1990) provides an analysis of Euler equation errors which also
suggests that habit persistence improves the fit of consumption models
through the time series properties of the data.

Table 1 - Summary Statistics

Consumption growth rates are for real per capita expenditures. Returns are arithmetic
nominal rates of return per annum. The return of treasury bills corresponds to a strategy of
rolling over one-month bills each month. DecN refers to a value weighted portfolio of common
stocks of the N-th size decile. Cbprern is the annualized yield-to-maturity of corporate
bonds rated BAA by Moodys investor services less the yield of AAA rated bonds. TBIMO is the
continuously-compounded rate of return of a 1-month treasury bill. Vwyld in the dividend
yield on the CRSP value-weighted index, measured as the previous 12-months dividend payments
divided by the level of the index. Divdiff is the difference between the dividend yield of
the CRSI' equally-weighted index and that of the value-weighted index. ISlope is the AAA
corporate bond yield less the one-month treasury bill rate. SSlope is the difference between
the three-month and one the one-month treasury bill yield. Cipx is the continuouslycompounded annual growth rate of the Index of industrial production. P1 is the inverse of
index level of prices of the smallest decile of common stocks on the NYSE, relative to the
average of the level for the preceding 12 months. X-ll indicates data seasonally adjusted by
the Commerce Department using the X-ll program. DSA indicates consumption data seasonally
adjusted by the authors using dummy variables. NSA denotes a not seasonally adjusted
component of the CPI.

c is consumption expenditures at date t. A is the
c + b1 c1 and
is the rate of time discount, and b1 is the parameter

concavity parameter,

representing habit persistence (b1 < 0) or durability (b1 > 0). In the time-

separable model, b1 is set equal to zero. Estimation is by generalized method of
moments (CMM). Asymptotic standard errors (s.e) are in parentheses. P-value is
the probability that a x2 variate exceeds the minimized sample value of the CMN

criterion function. The tests use a system of five asset returns: the common
stock portfolios from size deciles 1,5 and 10, a long-term government bond and a
one-month Treasury bill. Real returns are the nominal returns deflated by the
price deflator corresponding to the measure of consumption.

Table 10
Models with unrestricted mean Treasury bill returns: Quarterly Data, 1948:21986:2 (153 observations). The model assumes that a representative agent
maximizes:
E0[(l -

where C —

+b

A)1

tO

ci and c is consumption expenditures at date t. A is the

concavity parameter,

is the rate of time discount, and b1 is the parameter

representing habit persistence (b1 < 0) or durability (b1 > 0). The real Treasury

bill return in the model is replaced by the real return plus the parameter, L, to
leave the mean real return of the bill unrestricted. Estimation is by generalized
method of moments (GMM). Asymptotic standard errors are in parentheses. P-value
is the probability that a

variate exceeds the minimized sample value of the

CM criterion function. The instrumental variables are a constant and the eight
variables summarized in Figure 1. DecN is the real return of common stocks from
market value decile N. The real returns are the nominal returns deflated by the
nondurables price deflator.
