MEASURING RISK AVERSION FROM EXCESS RETURNS ON A STOCK INDEX
ABSTRACT
We distinguish the measure of risk aversion from the slope
coefficient in the linear relationship between the mean excess
return on a stock index and its variance.

Even when risk

aversion is constant, the latter can vanj significantly with the
relative share of stocks in the risky wealth portfolio, and with
the beta of unobserved wealth on stocks.
We introduce a statistical model with ARCH disturbances and
a time-varying parameter in the mean (TVP ARCH-N).

The model

decomposes the predictable component in stock returns into two
parts: the time-varying price of volatility and the time-varying
volatility of returns.

Introduction
The trade—off between risk and return is central to the theory of

finance.

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM(

framework

of Sharpe (1964),

(1966) was first to provide a comprehensive

for detennining asset prices with the theme that only

systematic risk is rewarded by the market.

The risk premium on the

market portfolio was linked to investor risk aversion by Totin (1958)
and Pratt (1964)

Morton (1969, 1973) shows that a lifetime consumption—investment
model yields risk premia of the same form as the single period model

when the investment opportunity set is constant and portfolios are
continuously rebalanoed.

This result will still hold when the variance

of the market portfolio varies randomly and cannot be hedged.

Bodie, Kane, and McDonald (1953) and Pindyck (1985) assume a single

factor CAPM, and use a 'reasonable" parameter for relative risk aversion
(between 3 and 4), as defined in Pratt

(1964), in an attempt to infer

risk premiums from estimated variances.

This model characterizes the evolution

We use rolling samples to examine the temporal behavior of the

more frequent than monthly. Because daily NYSE stock index data are not

To sum up, although the ARCH-H model is a useful tool in modeling
the stock index return, adjustments

to the model seem necessary. The

instability of the estimated value for risk aversion end the

inconsistent behavior of excess returns that the ARCH—H model predict
are important

empirical anomalies that should be resolved.

The estimated parameters from the rolling sample estimation
indicates

that a time—varying approach may be appropriate.

The rolling

sample estimated series is only an approximation because it uses

relatively short sample periods (five years is arbitrary),

and it is

unlikely that quarter to quarter changes of the ooeffioient would be so
large.

Further,

it is inconsistent to estimate a time—varying

parameter, while at the same time assuoting it to be constant within
five—year sample periods.

The next section introduces an ARCH-H model with a time-varying
mean/variance ratio, which allows formal estimation and explanation of
the variation of this parameter.

Conclusion
Analysis of an econometric model estimating a time—varying risk!

return relation of the stock market indicates that the TVP ARCH—M model
provides more precise estimates of the expected return of the stock
market index than the fixed—parameter

The model takes

explicit account of the role of risky assets other then stocks in
explaining the time variation of the mean/variance

Proxies for portfolio weights end the bets of the unobserved assets on

Although oor oeoi noel work

is

only nreliminsry,

further studies

in this vein seem promising. More detailed investigations may explain
the role of the rate of inflation in stock prioe movements. The
relationship of our findings with the recent literstuoe on
predictability of excess stock returns may be fruitful for future
research.
