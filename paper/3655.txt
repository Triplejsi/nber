THE EFFECT OF THE NEW MINIMUN WAGE LAW
IN A LOW-WAGE LABOR MARKET
ABSTRACT

After

nearly a decade without change, legislation that

affected the Federal minimum wage in two significant ways took
effect on April 1, 1990:

(1)

the hourly minimum wage was

increased from $3.35 to $3.80; and

(2)

employers were enabled to

pay a subminimum wage to teenage workers for up to six months.
This paper examines the effect of these changes in the minimum
wage law in a low-wage labor market using data from a survey of
167 fast food restaurants in Texas.

conclusions.

We draw three main

First, our survey results indicate that less

than

percent of fast food restaurants have taken advantage of the
youth subminimum, even though 73 percent of the sampled
restaurants paid a starting wage of less than $3.80 before the
new minimum wage took effect.

Second, we find that a sizeable

minority of fast food restaurants increased wages for workers by
an amount exceeding that necessary to comply with the higher
minimum wage.

Third, the majority of fast food restaurants in

Texas that were directly affected by the minimum wage increase
did not report that they attempted to offset their mandated wage
increase by cutting fringe benefits or reducing employment.

After nearly a decade without change,

legislation that affected the

minimum waga in two significant ways took effect on April 1, 1990.

First,

the new legislation increased the hourly minimum wage from $3.35 to $3.80 on
April

1,

1990, and will increase it again to $4.25 on April 1, 1991.

Second, the legislation enables employers to pay a subminimum wage to teenage
workers for up to six months.

The youth subminimum was enacted for a three-

year trial period, and is to be evaluated by the Department of Labor at the
end of the trial period.

Although the Federal Labor Standards Act (FLSA) has

permitted a limited subminimum wage for full-time students since 1961, the
new legislation covers all teenagers and is much easier to administer.
Essentially, employers may pay a subminimum wage to teenage employees for up
to 90 days without providing any additional training.

The subminimum wage

can be extended an additional 90 days if the employer's training plan meets
the Department of Labor's requirements, but no employee may be paid a
subminimust

wage for more than 180 days.1

The subminimum wage was an important component of the Bush
administration's minimum wage policy.

Indeed,

in June of 1989 President Bush

abruptly vetoed the Kennedy-Hawkins amendments to the ELSA explaining, "I
made it clear that

I

could accept an increase [in the minimum wage] only if

it were a modest one, and only if it were accompanied by a meaningful
training wage for new employees of a firm, to help offset the lob loss"
(Bureau of National Affairs, 1989).
The recent amendments to the minimum wage law provide the basis for
three topics examined in this paper.

The first topic we investigate relates

to the newly enacted youth subminimum.

We provide the first estimates of the

11n addition, the subminimum wage cannot be applied to more than 25
percent of an employers' workforce hours, and the subminimum cannot be paid
if an employee was laid off to make room for new subminimum-wage workers.

utilization of the subminimum wage.

Comparisons of the wage distribution for

16-19 year olds and 20-21 year olds using Current Population Survey (CPS)
data for 1989 and 1990 provide no evidence that employers are widely using
the subminimum.

In addition, we conducted a survey of 167 fast food

restaurants in Texas to more directly measure utilization.

Our survey

results indicate that less than 2 percent of fast food restaurants have taken
advantage of the youth subminimum, even though 73 percent of the sampled
restaurants paid a starting wage of less than $3.80 before the new minimum
wage took effect.

The survey also explores reasons why employers have not

been using the new youth subminimum.
The second topic concerns the effect of changes in the minimum wage on
the wage structure.

Many fast food restaurants in Texas responded to the

minimum wage increase by increasing starting pay from $3.35 to $3.80.

Phat

did these restaurants do to the compensation of workers whose wage had
previously risen to between $3.35 and $3.80? Using our survey data, we find
that 44 percent of employers in this situation increased the wage of these
workers by more than necessary to satisfy the new minimum wage.

One

interpretation of this finding is that employers are willing to pay extra
compensation to preserve the hierarchy in their wage structure that existed
prior to the minimum wage increase.
In addition, we find that firms that were constrained by the minimum
wage increased their starting wage by 40 cents per hour, while those that
were unconstrained (e.g., offered $3.80 or more) increased their starting
wage by an average 20 cents per hour.
(1983)

This finding parallels Grossman's

finding that an increase in the minimum wage induces a wage increase

for workers in jobs that pay slightly more than the minimum wage.

On the
S

other hand, it might also be due to a general rise in wages in Texas.

In

the recent increase in the minimum wage baa compressed the

distribution of starting wages across fast food restaurants.

In particular,

the effect of the local unemployment rate and company ownership on wages is
attenuated after the minimum wage increase.

Furthermore, the coefficient of

variation of starting wages declined by nearly one-third after the minimum
wage increased.
The final topic examined in this paper concerns nonwage offsets induced

by the minimum wage.

Our survey reveals no evidence that, compared to

restaurants that were already paying at least the new minimum wage,
restaurants that were forced to raise their starting wage by the new minimum
wage were more likely to cut fringe benefits, cut workers on a shift, or cut
the number of shifts.

II.

The Minimum Wage Increase of 1990 and the Wage Structure
To describe the impact of recent changes in the minimum wage on the wage

structure, we first analyze

CI'S

data for April to August 1989, and for April

to August 1990, the most recent months for which data are available at this
writing.

We restrict the sample to workers who are between age 16 and 21 and

who live in the 25 states that did

gg have

a state minimum wage exceeding

$3.35 per hour on April 1, 1990.2
Figure

1

contains a histogram of the wage distribution for workers aged

16-19 in 1989, and Figure 2 contains a histogram for workers in the same age
2The 25 states are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida,
Ceorgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi,
Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

It is quite apparent that since the new minimum wage law

took effect the spike in the wage distribution at $3.35 has

declined, end a

In fact, between 1989 and 1990 the share of

workers earning within $0.05 of $3.35 an hour fell from 17.4 to 4.1 percent,
while the share earning within a similar window of $3.80 increased from 5.6
to 15.9 percent.
Because employers are permitted to pay a subminimum wage between $3.35
and $3.80 only to workers under age 20, we can investigate whether this new
provision is being used by comparing the change in the share of workers
earning $3.35 or more but less than $3.80 between 1989 and 1990 for
potentially eligible workers (those age 16-19) and for ineligible workers
(those age 20-21).

The following tabulation shows the percent of workers in

the subminimum-wage range (with standard errors in parentheses), before and
after the new subminimum took effect, by age group:

The share of workers in the range ($3.35-$3.80] fell substantially for
both workers who were eligible for the subminimum wage and for those who were
not.

Moreover, the share fell by an even greater amount for those who, on

the basis of their age, were eligible to be paid a aubainimum, suggesting

3The wage rate is the hourly wage for hourly rated workers, and the
ratio of the usual weekly wage to usual weekly hours for salaried workers,

that the youth subminimum ia not being used.

These numbers are somewhat

difficult to interpret, however, because the CPS files we are using lack job
tenure information, which is necessary to determine whether workers in the
eligible age group are actually new employees who could be paid the new
subminimum.

Futhermore, the coeparison of 16-19 year olds with 20-21 year

olds may not be appropriate here because relatively few of the 20-21 year
olds are in the $3.35-$3.80 range, so the maximum decline in this earnings
group is 17 percent.

These ambiguities suggest the need for a more direct

approach to estimate utilization of the youth subminimum wage.

III.

Survey Design

To more directly study the impact of recent changes in the minimum wage
on a labor market where we would expect the minimum wage to have a large
impact,

we conducted a survey of fast food restaurants in Texas.

We selected

Texas because it is a low-wage state that does not have a state minimum wage
law that would override the FLSA.4

Moreover,

the fast food industry is a

low-wage industry that has lobbied against increases in the minimum wage and
has been a staunch supporter of a subminimum wage for youths (BNA, 1985).

And the fact that the fast food industry has extremely high turnover
(estimated as high as 300 percent per year [BNA, 1985]), and hires many
first-time workers makes it more likely that fast food restaursnts can take
advantage of the youth subminimum?
4The state minimum wage in Texas is $3.35 per hour, and there is no
provision for a subminimum. Therefore, the Texas state minimum wage law is
irrelevant for jobs that are covered by the federal minimum wage.
5lndeed, Love (1986) estimates that 1 in 15 workers obtained their
first job from McDonalds! Although we're not sure whether this estimate is
accurate, it must undoubtedly be the case that many young workers obtain

6
We designed a questionnaire to collect retrospective (pre-minimum wage
increase) and current information on starting wages, as well aa information
on the utilization of the new subminimum wage and on nonwage responses to the
minimum wage.

A copy of the questionnaire, containing tabulations of

responses to each question, is provided in the Appendix.
The survey was conducted as follows. We first collected the phone
numbers of every Burger King, Wendy's, end Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant
listed in the 1990 Yellow Pages of the metropolitan phone books for Texas.6

We then drew a systematic sample consisting of every other phone number
listed in the Yellow Pages.

After deleting duplicate numbers, disconnected

numbers, and wrong numbers, this yielded a universe of 294 potential
observstiona.7

We then attempted to interview the manager or assistant

ma4taer of these restaurants by phone between December 12 and December 18,
1990.

If a restaurant did not respond on the first cell, we called back as

many as two more times to try to elicit a response.

We obtained a total of 167 responses, for a response rate of 57 percent.

Survey Results
Table 1 cross-tabulates the starting wage for patt-time workets of

sampled restaurants b.fore and after the minimum wage increase.8 The table
indicates that 72.5 percent of the restaurants in our sample were compelled
to increase their starting wage by the rise in the minimum wage.

Furthermore,

one-third of the restaurants moved their starting wage from

exactly the old minimum to exactly the new minimum.9 From these tabulations,
it is clear that the survey has identified a universe of employers that is
likely to be affected by the minimum wage, and that has potential to use the
youth subminimum.

A.

Utilization of the Youth SubminimumWage
Table 2 reports a variety of survey results breaking the sample into two

groups:

those paying a starting wage below $3.80 and those paying above $3.80

prior to the minimum wage increase last April.

Only 1.8 percent of the

restaurants in our sample reported that they have used the youth subminimum.
Of the restaurants that paid newly-hired part-time workers less than the new
minimum wage, 3 percent utilized the youth subminimum. Finally, if we limit
8We focus on part-time workers because over two-thirds of fast food
workers are part-time workers, and because we have more complete wage data
for part-time jobs.
j

9The 8 restaurants that initially paid $3.35 and increased their wage
above $3.80 all paid exactly $3.85. And some of the managers of these
restaurants maintained that the new minimum was $3.85, not $3.80.

8

the sample to franchisee-owned restaurants that
previously started workers at
less than $3.80, the fraction of restaurants using the youth suhminimum is 4
percent.

(In contrast, none of the company-owned restaurants in the sample

utilized the subminimuis.)

These figures suggest that even in a low-wage

industry in a low-wage lahor market hardly any employers are using the youth
subminimum.
Why

are

fast food employers so reluctant to use the youth suhminimum?

Our survey elicited several possible explanations.

Perhaps most important,

83 percent of restaurant managers reported that they believed they could not
attract qualified teenage workers at a subminimum. This figure declines
only
slightly, to 78 percent, when we limit the sample to restaurants that
previously paid workers less than $3.80 to start. Thus, a large fraction of
managers appear to believe that the increase in the minimum wage coincided

win

an increase in workers' reservation wages.
Nevertheless, nearly 20 percent of managers who were not utilizing the

subminimum reported they could attract qualified workers at a subminimum
wage.

About half of those who thought they could attract
qualified workers

for less than $3.80 reported that they did not know about the new subminimum

wage option. Although it seems plausible that store managers or even small
f.;nchisees might be unaware of the subminimum wage amendments, it seems
irpLausible to us that company-owned restaurants fail to use the subminimiss
because of lack of information.

Three other reasons were frequently given

for not using the subminimum wage:

(I) managers believed

it wasn't fair to

pay a subminimuimwage to some workers; (2) the restaurant did not employ
teenage workers; (3) the manager believed the law was administratively
difficult to apply.

9
Perhaps our finding of a low take-up rate for the youth subminimum wage
should not be surprising in light of Freeman, Gray, and Ichniowski's
finding that only 3% of students'

(1981)

work hours were covered hy the subminim-um

wage permitted for full-time students in the late 1970s.

However, the new

youth subminimum wage is much easier to use than the full-time student
exemption. Notably, the youth subminimum applies to all teenage workera (not
just full-time students), and carries less cumbersome restrictions on the
hours of employees that can be covered by the subminimum.

In spite of its

advantages for employers vis-a-vis the full-time student subminimum wage,
utilization of the new youth subminimum wage appears to be quite rare.

Thus,

it is unlikely that the youth subminimum wage will have an important impact

on the training of young workers.

B.

Wage Compression
Table

and the Minimum Wage

2 shows that

between April

and December of 1990 the restaurants

that were required to increase their starting wage by the minimum wage hike
increased their starting wage by 12.2% (42 cents) on average, while those who
were already above the new minimum wage increased their starting wage by 4.8%
(19 cents) on average.
that

There are two potential explanations for why firms

were already paying above the new minimum wage increased their starting

'rage after the minimum wage increased.

First, as Grossman (1983) and Akerlof

and Yellen (1990) contend, relative wages may influence work effort so firms
already above the minimum wage may adjust their wages to maintain effort
levels.

Second, a more neoclassical explanation is that market forces would

have led to an increase in wages in the fast food industry in Texas even in

the absence of the minimum wage increaseJ°
Nevertheless, the increase in the minimum wage led to a substantial

reduction

in the dispersion of starting wages across restaurants.

S

For

workers
example, the coefficient of variation of starting pay for part-time
decreased by a third, from .074 to .049.11

The between-restaurant reduction

in dispersion is also evident from the wage regressions reported in Table

312

For example, the regressions show that company-owned restaurants pay

more to scart than franchisee-owned restaurants (see also Krueger, 1991),

and

that restaurants in areas wirh a higher unemployment rate have lower wages.
However, both of these effects are roughly halved after the increase in the
minimum wage.
Perhaps of more interest is information gathered by the survey on within
firm wage policy in response to the increaae in the minimum wage.

In

because the quarterly unemployment rate in Texas was relatively stable
the U.S.
throughout 1990, hovering around 6.1 percent. Furthermore,
between April
average wage in manufacturing increased by only 2.6 percent
and December, 1990.

We

also found that wage dispersion fell substantially in our CPS
the
samples following the increase in the minimum wage. For example,
coefficient of variation in hourly wages for 16-19 year olda fell from 0.56
in April-August of 1989 to 0.40 in April-August of 1990.
12We note that the sample of restaurants used in the regressions is
slightly different before and after the minimum wage increase. However,
the results are not qualitatively changed if we estimate the regressions on
a consistent set of restaurants.

hierarchy.

Of all restaurants that were initially paying less than $3.80 to

new hires, 40 percent maintained their wage hierarchy, and the remainder
compressed whatever wage differentials existed between long-..ervice workers
and new hires.

information on these questions.

Rows 5 and 6 of Table 2 provide some
First,

it is clear that the restaurants that

were forced to increase their starting wage by the rise in the minimum wage
are more likely to delay the first raise they give to workers, and to reduce
the amount of the first raise.

On the other hand, 85 percent of restaurants

that were forced to increase their starting wage did not change either the
amount of or time until the first pay raise.

If wage growth mirrors

productivity growth because of on-the-job training, this result suggests thdt
training was not adversely affected by the higher minimum wage in the
majority of fast food restaurants.

C.

Nonwage Responses to the Minimum Wage Increase
The final issue we consider is the extent to which fast-food restaurants

offset increased labor costs caused by the higher minimum wage by reducin:
fringe benefits or employment.

The results presented in lines 7, 8, and

?

f

Table 2 indicate that less than one-fifth of the restaurants reported that
they cut fringe benefits and a similar fraction reported that they cut
employment, despite the fact that over 70 percent of these firms were
constrained to increase their starting wages because of the minimum wage
increase.

One further striking finding from the table is that there appears

12

to be little difference in these nonwage responses between those directly
constrained by the new minimum wage and those paying starting wages above
$3.80 prior to April 1, 1990.

In summary,

fully 73 percent of firms that

were forced to increase pay to satisfy the new minimum wage did not report
cutting employees, shifts, or fringe benefits to cushion their mandated wage
increase.

V.

Conclusion
Several tentative conclusions can be drawn from our analysis.

First,

it

appears that few employers have elected to use the new youth aubainimum wage,
even in an industry where many employers could probably readily attract
teenage workers at a subminimum wage.

Second, we have found evidence that a

sizeable minority of fast food restaurants increased wages for workers by an
amount exceeding that necessary to comply with the higher minimum wage.

In

other words, many employers appear to pay a wage premium in order to maintain
their internal wage hierarchy.

Finally, the majority of fast food

restaurants in Texas that were directly affected by the minimum wage increase
did not report that they attempted to offset their mandated wage increase by
cutting fringe benefits, reducing employment, reducing the amount of workers'
first pay raise, or delaying the time until workers' first pay raise.
This behavior seems difficult to explain with the standard model that
economists use to evaluate the impact of a minimum wage.

On the other hand,

it may be more consistent with models of wage determination that emphasize
relative compensation, horizontal equity, and effort incentives.
