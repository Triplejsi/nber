TIME-VARYING VOLATILITY AND THE DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR
OF THE TERM STRUCTURE

ABSTRACT
In this paper, we consider a framework with which the cross
sectional and time series behavior of the yield curve can be

studied simultaneously. We examine the relationship between the
yield curve and the time-varying conditional volatility of the

Treasury bill market. We demonstrate that differently shaped
yield curves can result given different combinations of

volatility and expectations about future spot rates. Moreover,
adjusting the forward rate for the volatility related liquidity
premium can improve its performance as a predictor of future spot
rates at least for the period from August 1964 to August 1979.

I: INTRODUCTION
Much research has been done in the term structure literature about the existence

and the variability of term and liquidity premia. For example, Fama (1984a) and
McCulloch (1987) have examined the existence and the monotonicity of term premia.
McCulloch (1975) and Fama (1984b) have examined the existence ofliquidity premia.
Campbell (1987), Engle, Lilien and Robins (1987), Lauterbach (1989) and Engle, Ng and
Rothschild (1990) have examined the time variability of term premia. Of course, since term

premia and liquidity premia are related, results on one can indeed be translated into results
about the other. 1 To summarize the empirical results in terms of the term
premia, the

literature has generally found: (1) the term premia are non—zero, and (2) the term premia
are time—varying.

These results have important implications for the term structure. For instance, the

existence of term premia and the fact that they are time—varying mean that the
movements of the yield curve over time are driven not only by changes in the expectations

Term premium is defined as the difference between the expected one period holding return
of a long bond and the sure one period return of a one period bond. Liquidity premium is
traditionally defined as the difference between the forward rate and the expected future
spot rate. The relationship between term premium and liquidity premium is given in
2

about future one period interest rates but also by changes in the term premia. Moreover,
the shape of the yield curve is also changing over time. The exact shape of theyield curve

depends on the expectations about future interest rates as well as the expectations about
future movements of the term premia. Lastly, since the existence of time—varying term

premia implies the existence of time varying liquidity premia, the forward rate is not an
unbiased forecast of the future spot rate.
What i3 not yet clear is the exact nature of these non—zero time—varying term

premia (and liquidity premia) and their dynamic behavior. It was argued in the traditional
Liquidity Preference Theory that term premia exist because lenders prefer the liquidity
provided by short term bonds. Hence, to induce them to purchase long term bonds, extra
rewards have to be offered. Under the Liquidity Preference Theory, changes in the term
premia over time should be related to changes in the liquidity preference of investors in the
bond markets. Modern portfolio theory however suggests that it is also possible to have risk

related term premia. In that case, changes in the term premia over time would be related
to changes in the riskiness of the bonds over time.
In a recent paper, Engle—Ng---Itothschild (1990) (hereafter ENR) examine formally

the second possibility. They consider a one factor model for the excess returns on Treasury

bills of two to twelve months maturity in which the factor (a equally weighted bill
portfolio) itself has changing variance. The ENR model can be viewed as a special case of
the Asset Pricing Theories developed by Merton (1973), Ross (1976) and Breeden (1979).

In the ENR model, the factor risk premium is a linear function of the conditional volatility
of the factor. Hence the term premia and the liquidity premia will change over time as
volatility changes. Consequently, both the position and the shape of the yield curve should
change over time as volatility changes. ENR shows that their one factor model passes a
variety of diagnostic tests and compares favorably with previous empirical findings. Given

section II and is derived in the appendix.

the empirical success of the ENR model, it is interesting to examine in more detail the
economic implications of the model and how it might help answer some of the existing

puzzles in the term structure literature. As such, the purpose of this paper is not really
providing new statistical tests for the adequacy of the ENR model as much as providing a
new angle from which to view the evidence. Specifically, we want to address the follow

questions: (1) Can the ENR model generate plausible shapes for the yield curve? (2) What
is the effect of a change in bill market volatility on the position and shape of the yield
curve? And (3) Will the premium adjusted forward rates provide good forecasts for future

spot rates?
We address questions (1) and (2) in section III via simulation experiments. The
results indicate that the ENR model can produce a large set of differently shaped yield
curves including the puzzling hump shape. The analysis also suggests various qualitative

results regarding the relationship between the shape of the yield curve and the level of

volatility. In particular, the premium component is important relative to the expectation
component when volatility is very high. Hence the yield curve can be monotonicaily

increasing even though the spot rates are expected to be decreasing. On the other hand,
when volatility is low, the premium component is unimportant relative to the expectation
component and hence a monotonically decreasing yield curve could be produced if the spot

rate is expected to drop. For medium volatility levels, the exact shape of the yield curve
depends crucially on the tradeoff between the expectation component and the premium
component.

We address question (3) in section IV. We examine the preformance of the ENR

predictor for future spot rates. As in Fama(1976), we use the predictive performance of

past spot rates as a benchmark. We found that for the period before the 1979 change in
the Federal Reserve operating procedure the adjusted forward rates provide as good

predictions about future spot rates as the past spot rates. We also notice that the adjusted
forward
4

rates perform better in short horizon prediction than in long horizon prediction. We

attribute this to a decline in the quality of multiperiod variance forecasts (which are
required for the adjustments to forward rates for long horizon predictions) when we
lengthen the forecasting horizon. The predictive performance of the adjusted forward rates
are not good for the whole sample period from 1964 to 1985. The problem might come from
severe over adjustment during the 1979—1982 period when the bill market is extraordinarily

volatile. It is likely that the change in operating procedure by the Federal Reserve in 1979

did produce a structural change in the behavior of the bill market.
Analyses in section IV use the same dataset as in Engle, Ng, and Rothschild (1990)

with the addition of corresponding yields to maturity and forward rates data. The dataset
contains monthly returns, yields to maturity, and corresponding forward rates for Treasury
bills with maturities ranging from one to twelve months as well as the monthly returns ofa
NYSE+AMEX value weighted stock portfolio. The Treasury bill data is obtained from the

Fama Term Structure File in the 1985 CRSP Government Bond Tape. The stock data is
obtained from the 1985 CRSP Index Tape. The sample period is from August 1964 to
November 1985.

We will start off with a short review on the relationships among yields, term
premia, forward rates and liquidity premia as well as a review of the ENR model in the

next section. Readers familiar with both can start with section III.

II: A MODEL FOR THE TERM PREMIUMS

Let R) and R1) be the one period holding returns from time t—1 to time t
investing in pure discount bonds with n—period and 1—period to maturity, respectively.

Also let Et(.) be the expectation operator given all information available at time t. The
term premium of an n—period pure discount bond at time t, ,4tt), is defined as

(1)

(n) E1(R")) —R'

From forward substitution the yield to maturity at time t, r),2 of an n—period pure
discount bond is just the average of the subsequently realized holding returns or

r(n)=i
R(nTj+1)
t
nL1 t4-j

Since this identity must hold in expectation and since r' is in the information set at time
t, the yield to maturity can be related to the term premia according to3
(2)

r') = E(A) + Et(T)

where, A
T("=-'
t+1 - (n-j+i)
The first term on the right hand side of equation (2), E(A), is the expectation

component of the yield to maturity. It is the conditional expectation of average future

2

By definition, the yield to maturity of a one period discount bond at time t, denoted by
r1), is equal to the one period holding return of the one period bond from time t to time

t+1, denoted by
6

one—period spot rates. The modelling of this component has received a lot of attention in

traditional term structure research to which Dobson, Sutch, and Vanderford. (1976) gave a

very good review. The second term, E(T) is the term premium component of the yield
to maturity. If term premia are time varying then there will be changes in both the
position and the shape of the yield curve which are not explained by changes in the

expectations of the future one-period spot rate.
The one period forward rate at time t,

for the period from time t+n—1 to time

t+n, is also related to the term premia. Based on (2), the equation for the forward rate is:

(n) =

(3)

Et(r)i) + [n.E(T) _(n_1).E(T'))]

The first term on the right hand side of equation (3) is the expected one period spot rate
from time t+n—1 to time t+n. The liquidity premium,

which is traditionally defined

as the difference between the forward rate and the expected future spot rate is therefore
given by:
(4)

L) n.E(T) — (n_1).E(Tj'))

Again, if term premia are non—zero and time—varying then liquidity prernia will be
non—zero and time—varying. Hence, the forward rate will not be an unbiased predictor of

the future one period spot rate.4

Equations (2), (3), and (4) show that to understand the term structure, it is very
important to understand the nature and the dynamic behavior of the the term premia.
ENR considers the possibility that the term premia are risk related and is related to the
volatility of a single factor. The key characteristics of the ENR model can be summarized

by the diagram below:

A simple derivation of equation (2) is given in the appendix.

The term premium of a Treasury bill is driven by the time—
varying risk premium of an equally weighted bill portfolio
representing an unobservable bill market factor.
The time—varying risk premium of the bill portfolio is
driven by the time—varying conditional variance of the bill
portfolio itself.

The conditional variance of the bill portfolio is a function
of the past return innovations and conditional variance of
the bill portfolio itself as well as the past return
innovations and conditional variance of a value weighted
stock portfolio representing an unobservable stock market
fact or.

The model explicitly allows the time varying conditional volatility of a bill market

factor to determine the dynamic behavior of the term premia. It also allows the past

liquidity premium is zero and hence the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of future spot
rates.

Let bt' bt and 0bt be the excess return, risk premium and conditional excess

(1976), the intertemporal CAPM of Merton (1973), and the consumption beta model of
Breeden (1986). A simple justification of this pricing relationship is also given in the
appendix of ENR (1990) and in Campbell (1987). The remaining model description, [2] and

ENR did not find any direct influence from stock market volatility to the term premia.
They have estimated and tested a two factor model using a value—weighted stock portfolio
as an additional factor. The addition is not supported by the data.

Equations (6) and (7) define the factor risk premia and relate risk premia to conditional
volatility. This specification is motivated by Campbell (1987), French, Schwert, and
Stambaugh (1987), and Engle, Lilien, and Robins (1987). Equations (8) and (9) allow past
innovations of bill portfolio and stock portfolio excess returns to affect their conditional
variances. This relationship is suggested by the ARCH model of Engle (1982) and

Bollerslev (1986). The specification can be interpreted as a VAR model for the squared
residuals of the bill portfolio excess return and the stock portfolio excess return.

The complete model as described by equations (5) through (9) is estimated by ENR
using the holding period returns data described in section I. Since most of the analyses in

this paper are based on the results in ENR, we have included in table I below the
parameter estimates in their paper for the sake of completeness.6

Engle, Ng and Rothschild (1989) use

estimating the conditional variance of the bill and stock portfolio excess returns in
the first step and then estimate the equation for individual bill excess return using the
estimated bill and stock portfolio conditional variances as predetermined variables in the
second step. Lin (1989) gives a detailed comparison of this method (two step univariate
GARCH) to three other estimation procedures, namely, ML, restricted ML and two step
ML. The procedure of Engle, Ng and Rothschild give consistent estimates for the
parameters of interest. However, Lin (1989) show that the estimated standard errors are

Yield and liquidity premium

Based on equations (7) and (9), equation (5) for the term premium can be rewritten
as a function of the past innovations and conditional volatilities of the bill market factor
and the stock market factor as follows:

(10)

(n) = ,(n) + a)cb +
+

[bbt_1 + °bb°b—1 + bs1st_1 + °bs O]

Using equations (8), (9) and (10), the equation for yield and the equation for

liquidity premium can be rewritten as functions of the conditional volatilities of the bill
and stock portfolio excess returns. The equation for the yield to maturity is

The first term on the right hand side of the yield equation is the expectation

component of yield—to--maturity, the second term is the time invariant part of the term
premium component. The sum of the first and second terms on the right hand side gives
the yield—to—maturity when the stock and bill portfolio conditional volatilities are at their

unconditional mean levels. The remaining two terms on the right hand side give the effects
of having the conditional volatilities deviate from the mean volatility levels. The equation

for liquidity premium has a similar interpretation. The first term on the right hand side of
the liquidity premium equation gives the level of liquidity premium when stock and bill

conditional volatilities are at their mean levels. The other two terms give the effects of
having stock and bill conditional volatilities deviate from their mean levels.

Using the parameter estimates in Table I from ENR (1990), the parameters in the

ifi: THE SHAPE OF THE YIELD CURVE
Given the yield equation (11), the liquidity premium equation (12) and the

parameter estimates in the table II, we can ask: (1) Whether or not this model can
generate yield curves of the commonly observed shapes? And (2) What is the relationship

between the level of volatility and the position and shape of the yield curve? To answer
theses questions, we perform some simulation experiments. Below, we will give a

description of the experiments and their implications.

Description of the computational experiments

Since the shape of the yield curve is determined jointly by expectations about future

spot rates (which we haven't modelled up to this point) and expectations about future term
premia (which are given by the last three terms on the right hand side of equation (11)),
two set of experiments are conducted. In the first set, we focus on the term premium effect.

13

We consider a scenario in which future spot rates are expected to stay at the current level.
In other words, the one period spot rate is assumed to follow a simple random walk process

without drift. Under this assumption the shape of the yield curve is determined solely by
the term premium component. In the second set, we manage to study how interaction

between the expectation component, E(A), and the term premium component,
could produce a richer set of yield curves. For the ease of demonstration, We
consider a scenario in which the one period spot rate follows a simple random walk with

drift. The analyses are as follows:
Scenario 1

The one period spot rate is a simple random walk without drift:
(13)

r'

=

(where

+
is a mean zero random noise)

The expectation part, Et(A) is equal to r1) for all n. Hence, the shape of the yield
curve is determined solely by the premium:
(14)

E(T) = T(n)

0st+1s' + 4).[obt+1_b]

To see what kind of yield curve is available, the value of this term premium part is
computed for different levels of stock and bill market conditional volatility. We have
considered five different cases. First, both stock and bill conditional volatilities are set at
their highest levels observed in the sample. Second, stock volatility is set at its sample
average level and bill volatility is set at its highest in—sample level. Third, both stock and
bill volatility are set at their sample average levels. Fourth, stock volatility is set at its
sample average level and bill volatility is set at its lowest level in sample. Fifth, both stock
and bill volatility are set at their lowest in—sample levels. The results are given in table III
below:

The choice of the random walk model for the expectation component is mainly for the ease

of demonstration. The theme of this paper is on the modelling of the term premium
component rather than the modelling of the expectaion component. Readers interested in
the later can take a look at Dobson, Sutch and Vanderford (1976) and Melino (1983). Both

The results indicate that even under a random walk assumption, the yield curve can
still take either monotonic or humped shape. Under normal or high volatility levels, the
yield curve will be upward sloping. However, under low volatility levels, the yield curve

can have humped shape. Where the yield curve will peak depends crucially on the level of

volatility. The lower the level of volatility, the earlier it will peak. Even under the high
volatility case, the rate of increase diminishes as a function of maturity introducing

curvature into the term structure.
Of course, since the shape of the yield curve is determined jointly by the expectation

component and the term premium component, adding the effect from the expectation
component will give us a even richer set of yield curves. Adding the expectation component

also allows us to assess the role played by each of the components and their relative

importance. This is the remaining part of the experiment:

papers give good survey on earlier works on expectation formation.

To study how yield curves of different shapes can be generated under different
combinations of the expectation part and the premium part we consider ten possible
regimes each with a different combination of the drift term in the random walk, stock
volatility and bill volatility. To understand the difference between an expected increase in
the spot rate and an expected decrease in the spot rate, the analysis is done with positive
drift as well as temporary negative drift8. The results are given in table IV below:

The numbers given in table IV have some interesting implications. First of all, even
when the spot rate is drifting up, it is still possible to have a hump shaped yield curve
provided that volatility is low enough and the positive drift is not too big. Secondly, when

volatility is very high, the term premium part can be more important than the expectation
part in terms of magnitude. Indeed, even when the spot rate is drifting down, it is still
possible to have an upward sloping yield curve provided that volatility is high enough.

Thirdly, during a period in which the spot rate is drifting down, even an average level of
volatility can produce a humped shape yield curve. Actually, where exactly the yield curve
will peak depends on the direction and magnitude of the drift as well as the levels of stock

and bill market volatilities. Given the same volatility levels, the faster the spot rate drifts
down, the earlier the yield curve will peak. With a very big negative drift, the yield curve
will simply be downward sloping. On the other hand, given the same drift, the higher the

a negative drift term for a short time period.
17

volatility levels, the later the yield curve will peak. With very high levels of volatility in
the stock market and the bill market, the yield curve will simply be upward sloping.

Moreover, bill market volatility seems to be more important than stock market volatility
in determining the shape and position of the yield curve.

IV: PREDICTING FUTURE SPOT RATES
The usefulness of forward rates as predictors of future spot rates has received much

attention in the term structure literature. Generally, the forward rates contain not only
information about expectations on future spot rates but also "premia" related to either risk
or liquidity. As we have demontrated in the second section, unless these premia are

properly controlled for, the forward rates are not unbiased predictors for future spot rates.

Since the ENR model relates the term premia and hence the liquidity premia to volatility,
whether we can get better forecasts of future spot rates by adjusting the forward rates for
the time—varying liquidity premium given by the ENR model is an interesting question. In

fact, since the ENR model treats term premia as "risk" premia, the usefulness of adjusting
for "risk—based" liquidity premia might also give us some idea about the nature of the

premia. To answer this question, we first look at the ability of the ENR model to explain
the difference between the subsequent realization of the short rate and the n—period ahead
forward rate. The equation we consider in our regression analysis is as follow:
(16)

4)_r.1 = a0 + a1•L + e1

On the left hand side of the above regression equation, we have the difference between the

current forward rate and the future spot rate. On the right hand side are a constant term,
the liquidity premium predicted by the ENR model, and a mean zero random error term.
The liquidity premia are computed using equation (12) and the corresponding parameter

18

estimates given in table II.

Under the null hypothesis that the ENR model is appropriate, the a0 coefficients
should be zero and the a1 coefficients should equal one for all n. The regression results for

equation (16) are presented in table V below.

(The numbers in parentheses are asymptotic standard

correction)
The results indicate that for the period before the change in operating procedure by the
Federal Reserve in 1979, the liquidity premium implied by the ENR model can well explain

the difference between the forward rate and the expost future spot rate. The coefficient
is insignificantly different from zero for all maturities. Also, the coefficient a1 is

19

a0

significantly different from zero and insignificantly different from one for all maturities.
However, the regression results for the full sample period including periods before and after
the 1979 change are poor. The coefficient a1 is significantly different from zero only for

maturities from two to five months. Moreover, it is signicantly different from one for all
maturities. The risk related liquidity premium implied by the ENR model does have some
explanatory power for the difference between the forward rate and the expost future spot
rate. However, the magnitude is far from being close to the prediction of the model.

The above results suggest that at least for the period before the change in operating
procedure by the FED, adjusting the forward rates for the liquidity prernia implied by the
ENR model should give us better forecasts for the future spot rates. What is not clear is

how much better? To assess whether or not the adjustment is important economically we
have computed the R—squares of three different regressions: (1) a regression of future spot

rate on current spot rate, (2) a regression of future spot rate on the corresponding forward

rate computed from the current yield curve, and (3) a regression of future spot rate on the
forward rate which is adjusted for the liquidity premium implied by the ENR model. The
liquidity premium is computed based on equation (12) and the parameter estimates in
table II. The regressions are performed for different forecasting horizons arid the R—squares

are reported in table VI below.

The results presented in table VI confirm the findings of Fama that the forward rate is not

as good a predictor of the future spot rate as is the current spot rate. Adjusting the forward
rates for the volatility related liquidity prernia does improve the R—squares especially for

the period before 1979/9. After the adjustment, the forward rates provide forecsts for the

future spot rates almost as good as the current spot rate. However, the magnitude of the
R—squares also indicates that the premium part is of second order importance. In other
words, the ENR model seems to be working, but it is mainly for fine tunning as the bill
market volatility is usually low.
Finally we compare directly the relative performance of the premium—adjusted

forward rate and the current spot rate as predictors for future spot rates by putting
simultaneously the premium—adjusted forward rate and the current spot rate in the
forecasting equation for future spot rate. The regression equation is:

21

r11 = b0 + b1.[f)—L)] + b2.r1) + et+i

(17)

If the ENR model is appropriate, then in principle, the current spot rate should have no
additional predictive power for the future spot rate beyond that of the premium—adjusted
forward rate. In other words, the coefficient b2 in equation (17) should be small and
insignificant. The regression results are presented in table VII below.

For the sub—sample period ending August 1979, the estimated coefficient b1 for the

premium—adjusted forward rate is significant for most n. And, the estimated coefficient b2

for the current spot rate is far from being close to one which is the value predicted by a
simple random walk model for spot rate. The highest b2 we got in that sub—sample period

is only 0.6710 for n=3 and the lowest is 0.3431 for n=4. The results strongly suggest that
the premium—adjusted forward rate has power in predicting future spot rate. For the full
sample period, the estimated coefficient b2 is also smaller than what one would have
expected if the random walk model were true (especially for n=2,3). However, the

coefficient b1 is significant only for n=2 and n=3. It is likely that the change in operating
procedure by the Federal Reserve in 1979 did produce a structural change in the behavior
of the bill market which shows up very clearly in these comparisons.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we reexamine the Factor ARCH model for Treasury bills introduced
by Engle, Ng, and Rothschild (1990). We investigate: (1) whether or not the model can
generate plausible shapes for the yield curve, (2) the relationship between the level of

volatility in the bill market and the position and shape of the yield curve, and (3) whether
or not adjusting the forward rates using the volatility related liquidity premia will help in
predicting future spot rates. We found that the combined effect of the expectation
component and the premium component can produce yield curves of the commonly
observed shapes. However, the yield curve is more likely to be monotonically increasing

when volatility is high. When volatility is low, the premium component is not very

important relative to the expectation component. Hence, the shape of the yield curve is

determined mostly by expectations about future spot rates. Furthermore, adjusting the
forward rate for the volatility related liquidity premium can improve its performance as a
predictor for future spot rate at least for the period from August 1964 to August 1979.
