sense. Our methodology is appropriate when one regards technical change as an ongoing

process where distinct permanent shocke originate at different points in time. A general
discussion of the relationships between various tests of convergence is contained in Bernard
and Durlauf[l991a1

3. Output relationships across countries
3.1 Econometric methodology
We now turn to the cross-country analysis to look

for cointegration and convergence.

First we discuss the various statistical

techniques employed along with their associated
caveats, Then we describe the annual data series. Next
we present the empirical results
on common stochastic elements to growth for

pairs of countries, followed by a ps.irwise look

at convergence, as both were defined in section
veloped by Phillips and Ouliaris (l988J for a

2. Finally we use recent techniques de-

multi-country look at both cointegration and

convergence.

For bivariate output relationships, we can test for the presence of common trends
through the use of cointegration techniques. In
a companion paper (Bernard and Durlauf
[1990bj}, we find all 15 countries in our sample exhibit
substantial persistence in the univariate output rePresentations. The
presence of persistence, or unit roots, in the univariate
data naturally suggesti the use of
cointegration techniques for analyzing the bivariate sad
multivariate relationships. In particular we employ a methodology described by Engle and
Ct-anger [l987j which is based on the estimated residuals

of cointegrating regressions. To

test for coTlunon stochastic elements in a pair of countries we estimate the equation

Since we do not know the actual autoregressive structure, we choose the minimum of the
t-statistics over a range of lag lengths.3 Recommended by Engle and (3ranger (1957]. this
statistic allows for non-white noise processes for the stationary series produced by the cointegraLing vector. As is well known, the main drawback of this test is its relatively low power

Theorem 3.2 embodies two perspectives in

conclude that

this test has reasonable power against a range of mean reverting alternatives.

Further, by

examining the spectral distribution function through the Ur(t) statistics, we can completely
characterize the second moment properties of the different series.

Finally we turn to multivariate tests for common stochastic components. Unfortunately,

there is no natural analogue to the spectral distribution function tests we employ in our
bivariate analysis. Hence we rely on analysis of the zero frequency of the spectral density
matrix, recalling that the zero frequency in this case measures the variance-covariance matrix

of innovations to the various stochastic trends.
For multivariate series, as in the univariate ease, common trends and convergence will

impose distinct restrictions on the zero frequency of the spectral density matrix. Common
trends require that the persistent parts of different time series be proportional; convergence

requires that the persistent parts be equal. Let Y, denote the n x 1 vector of output levels

Data
The data used in both the empirics.l exercises are annual log real GD? per capita in

1930 international dollars for current boundaries. The series run from 1900-1987 for 15
industrialized countries with the GD? data drawn from Maddison [19891 and the population
data from Maddison [l9821. Recent years are updated from IFS yearbooksY Figures 1 and
2 present graphs of the fifteen series over the whole sample in levels and logs respectively and

Table 1 gives the means and standard deviations of the growth rates. The picture in levels
shows dramatic income growth over the period but no absolute narrowing of the overall

spread- In logs, however, the narrowing is eubstantial. From this visual perspective, the
convergence hypothesis looks to be an appropriate starting point, in particular, the trends

in the various series appear to keep the series within a fixed range. However, Figures 3

and 4 show the fourteen series as deviations from log 113 output, i.e.
differentials narrow across the whole sample, but there does not appear to be any tendency
to converge to the US level.

5.2. Multivariate tests
Finally we consider tests for cointegration and convergence with more than two time
series. This section gives us a sense of the extent of common stochastic

components for blocks
of countries. If idiosyncratic elements dominate for every country then we would expect to
find n distinct roots for vs countries. If countries converge then we would expect to find
1

distinct root. If the number of significant roots lies between these

extremes, this indicates
the presence of common elements in international output. As an alternative measure of the
number of common trends, we look at the cumulative percentage of the sum of the roots. If
the first p C vs largest roots contribute 95% or more of the sum, then we conclude that there

are p important common stochastic trends for the block.13

To use these various measures, we must arrange the countries into groups. We first
consider all 15 countries together. We initially test for cointegration by performing the

Phillips'Ouliaris bounds tests on the first difference of output, th. Next, we repeat the
exercise For those six European countries which displayed

a high degree of cointegration in
the psirwise results. Finally, to determine if the removal of those six conntries affects the
results from the original 15, we run the tests•on the remaining nine.
Second we examine the behavior of output deviations. In order to identify convergence
for the 15 country group, we test using IAID9,, having subtracted off the US output, as in
Theorem 3.4. We separately test for convergence in the 6 European economies exhibiting
substantial cointegration by examining output deviations from France and in the 9 remaining

countries by examining output deviations from the US.

In Table 8, we present the ?hillipe'Ouliaris bounds tests

for cointegration and the

cumulative sums of the eigenvalues for the

groups mentioned above.14 There are two distinct
tests for each group. First if the upper bound is less than the critical value for a given p, we
can reject the null hypothesis that there are p or more distinct roots, If the lower bound is

distinct roots.
Table 9 contains the results of the convergence teats and presents the upper and lowe
bounds on the largest eigenvalue of output deviations as well as cumulated sums of eigeii

values for the different groups of countries. Here, if the lower bound on the largest root
greater than the critical level we can accept the no convergence null.

For the fifteen country sample and critical value C1 (= ?)15, we reject the null h1

8 and 9 reveals that the variance contributions of the first few (actors are
comparable for

the levels and deviations, suggesting that France does not contain a common Factor for the
remaining economies in the subsample.
We also consider the behavior of the sample after removing these six European countries

from the larger set. The nine remaining countries display a large number of distinct roots.
We reject the null that there are 7 or more distinct roots, but we can accept the null that

there are at least 5 for both critical values. The largest five sum to 95.7% of the total. It
appears that removing the six countries has dropped Lhe number of distinct roots from the
t5 country case by at most one. We still do not have completely idiosyncratic components
dominating the sample. The convergence test for this subsample once again accepts the no
convergence hypothesis.

These results do not support either of the extreme hypotheses that countries converge
or that they are entirely dominated by idiosyncratic elements. There is substantial evidence
for consmon atochastic components, particularly in the European sub-sample.15

6. Conclusions
This paper attempts to answer empirically the question of whether there is convergence

in output per capita across countries. This question is important to a large body of recent
macroeconomic theory as new models of economic growth, in contrast to traditional formulations generating turnpike results, have shown how long run divergence can occur across
economies.

We first construct a stochastic definition of convergence based on the theory of integrated

time series. Time series for per capita output of different countries can fail to converge
only if the persistent parts of the time series are distinct. Consequently, we are able to
16

Using a different multivariate methodology, Bernard [199l} finds similar results for these

samples.

23

identify the common elements of long term growth across economies by esandning whether

deviations in aggregate output series contain unit roots; in addition, we can determine
whether aggregate output in different economies is determined by common factors through
cointegration analysis.

Our analysis of the relationship among long term output movements across counLries
reveals little evidence of convergence. Both time and frequency domain approaches indicate

that there is substantial persistence in per capita output deviations. Virtually all 01 our
hypothesis tests accept the null hypothesis of no convergence for both bivariate and multivariate data samples. Our rejection of convergence holds despite the argument by DeLong

floss] that concentration on OECD economies will hiss empirical work towards accepting
convergence. On the other hand, we find evidence that there is substantial cointegration
across OECD economies. Further, we find that the number of integrated processes driving

the 15 countries' output series appears to be on the order of 4-6. Our results therefore imply that there is dearly some set of common factors which jointly determines international

output growth.
Overall, our condusions on the absence of convergence are consistent with either the
class of macroeconomic growth models which emphasizes the potential for multiple steady

state equilibria due to complementarities or those Arrow-Debreu models where microeco-

nomic differences can cause divergence. This ambiguity is natural given the atheoretical
nature of the data snatysis. An important next step in empirical work on convergence is the

estimation of different stochastic growth models to determine the mapping of our reduced
form results into structural inferences. In turn, atructural estimation will permit the evaluation of whether divergence in aggregate economies is indicative of essential deviations from

the competitive equilibrium paradigm.

If the upper bound, A,ci. is less than the critical value we reject the null hypothesis that

then we accept the null hypothesis that there are at least p distinct root& As emphasized
by Phillips and Ouliaris, there is no preassigned critical value selected for these statistics,
However, the tests are designed so that if there are zero eigenvalues, the power of the test

will go to one asymptotically. If the matrix is of full rank but some of the roots are small,
there is a relatively high probability of mistakenly rejecting the null.
We define some critical values for the two null hypotheses. For the purpose of identifying

whether the series are cointegrated, we examine the bounds of A relative to two critical

values, C1 = 0J0 and C2 = 0.05. These critical values assess the average of the rn
smallest eigenvalues in comparison to the average of all the eigenvalues. Consequently we

compare the average variance of the smallest in factors to the average variance of all n

factors. Using the upper bound statistic and the critical value, C1, we reject the null of
n — m + 1(q + 1) or more distinct roots if the sum of the smallest ns eigenvalues is less than

LOrn% of the sum of all the eigenvalues. Interpreted differently we reject if the upper bound

is less than m x 10% of the average root. Employing the same critical value and the lower
bound statistic, we accept the null of at least q + 1 distinct roots if the sum of the smallest
rn eigenvalucs is greater than m x 10% of the average root. One employs C2 in an analogous
fashion.

The null hypothesis of no convergence requires that all eigenvalues for the matrix

upper bound is less than C1 (or C3), accept the null of no convergence if the lower hound is
