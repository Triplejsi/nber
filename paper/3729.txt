INTRODUCTION

An important part of the debate on the response of prices to monetary shocks has
centered on the dynamic discrepancy between economies with and without price rigidities,
on the magnitude and persistence of these discrepancies, and on whether the monetary

authority should attempt to exploit rigidities or not.
These issues have been typically addressed in a framework in which individual prices
(or wages) adjust according to some fixed time-schedule,resulting in a sluggish aggregate
price leveL Caplin and Spulber

(henceforth CS) show

that such an assumption

when the fixed time-schedule approach is abandoned

in favor of having individual prices adjnst according to a rule limiting the size of the
departure from a target real price (a state dependent rule), results on monetary policy
effectiveness may change dramatically. They provide an example where individual prices are
controlled infrequently according to simple state dependent rules, but where the aggregate
price level is fully flexible respect to certain types of monetary shocks (both anticipated
and unanticipated).
CS's economy, whiledynamic, starts off and remalns at its steady state; the assumptions
they make ensure that —except for a location parameter determined by the current level
of the money stock— the distribution of prices is self-replicating. Many new issues arise
when the shape of this distribution is allowed to change over time. For example, does the
economy have any natural forces pushing it towards the CS limit? What is the path of
output while outside the steady state? Is there a unique equilibrium path? Which is the
role played by strategic interactions in shaping the dynamic path

of output? Is there a role

for monetary policy?
This paper provides a framework within which someof these questions can be answered.
We consider the simple microeconomicstate dependent rule used by CS; the fixed (S, s)
rule, which can be justified by the presenceof fixed costs of adjusting prices ("menu costs").

This pricing rule is optimal in certain sections of the paper; in others it corresponds to an
approximation of the first best rule. Under the maintained assumption of fixed (S,s) pricing
rules, we describe the endogenousevolution of the distribution of prices, and the way this
affects both output fluctuations and the response of output to monetary shocks.
The basic macroeconomicframework —which corresponds to an extension of Blanchard
and Kiyotaki [1987] to a dynamic setting— is presented in Section 2, Section 3 extends the

CS neutrality result to the case where firms differ in the shocks they

are subject to, the

adjustment costs they perceive,and the demand elasticities they face.

that monetary policy that uses information on the level of output and
firms' prices has effects on output outside the steady state. Yet monetary policy remains

MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK

lefankiw [1985] shows the potential first order effectsof monetary policy when small (sec-

ond order) non-convex costs of adjusting prices are present and competition is imperfect.1
Recent static general equilibrium models have furthered our understanding of the macroeconomic role of such costs (e.g. Blanchard and Kiyotaki [1987], Rotemberg [1987]). These

modelshave several elements in common: (a) an aggregateoutput equation relating output
to real balances (aggregate demand) at a given instant in time, Y(t) = G (M(t)/Q(t)), with
Y, M and Q denoting aggregate output, money stock and aggregate price level, respectively,
and G' > 0; (b) a frictionless pricing equation for each firm q7(t) = H (Q(t), M(t)/Q(t)),
with q? denoting the i-th firm's optimal (private) frictionlessprice, and H1 > 0, H2 > 0;
(c) a menu cost of changing prices so that the actual price charged by firm i, qj, may differ
from its optimal frictionlessprice within some range; (d) a symmetric aggregate price index;
(e) the assumption that prices are at their frictionless optimal level before the monetary
shock; (f) the assumption that equilibria are symmetric and (g) the assumption that cost

equivalent increase in the price

level. However, in the presence of menu costs there is a range in which actual prices do not

increase with the money stock, although frictionlessprices do. As a result, the aggregate
price level does not match the increase in the money stock. This raises real balances and,
through aggregate demand, output.
Caplin and Spulber [1987] extend the previous model to a dynamic setting. They use
results on optimal dynamic pricing rules in the presence of fixed costs of price adjustments
(Barro [1972], Sheshinski and Weiss [1977] and [1983]) to give more structure to assumption (c). Under certain conditions on the process describing the path of money, including
monotonicity, the presence of menu costs leads firms to follow one sided, fixed, (S, s) pricing rules. The price charged by a firm remains fixed until enough inflation (possibly not
realized) accumulates so that its price is a given fraction s below its frictionless optimal
value. Once this trigger level is reached, firms reset their price to a fraction S above their
frictionless optimal price. Formally, denoting log qj and log q' by p, and p7, respectively,

the

above pricing nile implies that p(t)—p7(t)belongs to (s,S] for all i and t. A continuum of
firms is considered: i E [0, 1], and the difference between the logs of the i-tb firm's actual

and frictionlessoptimal price is denoted by z,(t), which therefore belongs to (s, 5]. In order

to remove constants that are irrelevant in our analysis, we assume that .s = —S.
CS also dispose of assumption (e). The reason for doing this is that in a menu cost
economy where monetary shocks occur more than once firms are not

z,(t) =

at the point where

before every shock. Violation of condition (e) is important since the effects of
monetary policy become ambiguous. For example, if all firms are bunched close to their
0

trigger point s, a (positive) monetary shock is likely to lower real balances and output
instead of raising them.
If the money stock increases continuously, the logarithm of a firm's nominal price increases by a quantity equal to the width of the corresponding (5,s) band every time a firm
adjusts its price; this amount is denoted by A. Substituting the expression for q7 shown in
(b) in the definition of z(t), yields z(i) as a periodic function —with period A— of: (i)
the initial conditions faced by the i-th firm, z(0), (ii) the logarithm of the aggregate price

level, P(i), and (iii) the logarithm of the aggregate money stock, m(t):

z0) = S — F (z(O), P0), m(t) — p0)) (mod A),

(1)

where x (mod A) denotes the remainder of dividing x by

A.

Suppose initially F(z(U),P(t),m(t) P(t)) (mod A) = 0. That is, the i-th firm just
changed its price and therefore is at the target level S. If now m(i) rises, ceteris paribus,
real balances rise. This puts upward pressure on the firm's frictionless optimal price and
—

This continues happening as the money stock rises bringing F(., ., .) closer
to A, thus z(t) closer to the trigger level a. Once z;(t) reaches a, the price is immediately
reset to 5, starting a new cycle.
The effects of changes in P(t), also ceteris paribus, are less clear since substitution and
lowers z1(fl.

real balances effects play opposing roles on the determination of the frictionless optimal
price. An increase in P(L) raises p(t) through the substitution effect but lowers it through
the real balances effect. This tradeoff is a well known source of multiple equilibria (e.g.
Ball and Romer [1987]) and affects the dynamic response of output to monetary shocks in
important ways; these issues are discussed in Sections 4 and 5.
CS showed that money is neutral when the above assumptions are combined with an
initial distribution of (the logarithm of) prices that is uniform on (a, 5]. Here we drop the
symmetry assumptions made in CS and the models mentioned above. This allows us to
address interesting non-steady state issues and study the generality of CS's steady state
neutrality result. This is done in four ways: (a) ther can be an arbitrary distribution of
firms' initialpositions within their pricing cycle; (b) thereare firm-specific cost and demand
shocks (idiosyncratic shocks), (c) the cost ofchanging prices may differ across firms, and (d)
there may be differences in demand elasticities across firms. Extension (b) corresponds to

modifying the optimal pricing equation so that q(t) = H(Q(t),M(t)/Q(t),Wi(t)), where
WQ) represents shocks affecting only firm i (and wQ) its logarithm), with (just for convention) H3> 0. Equation (1) then becomes:

Blanchard and Kiyotaki's [1987j (henceforth BK) model, presented in the appendix, yields
the following functional form for z,(t):

z(t)du — p(O)) (mod j).

If m(i) and w(t) are interpreted as deviations from their values at time t = 0, and z(t)
z(t) — z(0), then equation (3) is equivalent to:
(4)

The term

z(t) = s — (s + m(t) + w(i) + kj 1z,(i)du — zi(0)) (mod Ai).
kfzdu in (3) reflects the fact that firms look at the aggregate price level (i.e.

real balances and substitution effects do not necessarilycancel) when setting their prices.
Consider the case where k is positive and the money stock is fixed. If firms' prices are
(on average) above their frictionlessoptimum, the i-th firm has more pressure (on average)
to raise its price. Conversely, if on average other firms' prices are below their frictionless
optimal price then the i-th firm has less pressure to change its price. This corresponds to
the concept of strategic cornp1ementariy. If k is negative, there is strategic substitutability
between firms.

The model underlying equation (3) can be extended to incorporate heterogeneityin the
relation between firms' (or sectors') behavior and the business cycle. We introduce this
realistic feature by letting the income elasticities of the demands faced by firms differ.2
This leads to an expression analogous to (3) with k + 1 — /3 in the place of k, where I3 is
the income elasticity of the demand faced by firm i and f /3 di = 1. Firms with large values
of /3, have more incentives to raise their prices when output is above average than firms
with small values of /3,.
Defining the (logarithm of the) price level by P(t) = p,(t) di, using the definition of
z,(t) and the fact that in this model y(t) logY(t) = m(t) — P(t), it follows that output

f

is a linear function of the average deviation of prices from their frictionless optima:
(5)

y(t) = —(1 + k)j z,(t) di.

Output falls (rises) when the average price deviation (from the frictionless optima) rises
(falls). Any effect of money on output comes through its effect on this average.
2Allowing for heterogeneityin price elasticities is

a tivia1 extension of the casewe consider.

PRINCIPLE OF UNIFORMITY AND NEUTRALITY

In this section we show that the principle underlyingCaplin and Spulber's neutrality result
remains valid in the presence of various sources of heterogeneity among firms. Underlying
this result is the fact that once the distribution of firms within their pricing cycle is uniform,

it remains uniform as long

as the sources affecting firms' prices are independent from their

price deviations.

In order to make the above statements precise, we begin by defining the cross-section
distribution of firms' price deviations at time t, Fg(z). Other cross-section distributions are
defined analogously. The quantity Fg(z) is equal to the fraction offirms with price deviations
less than or equal to z.3 It describes the distribution of firms' percentage deviations that
actually attains at time t, and is totally unrelated to the observer's state of knowledge. We
refer to it as the "distribution of price deviations," for short.
Next we derive the steady state distribution in the simplest case, where firms have
the same (S, a) bands and demand elasticity parameters, and no strategic interactions are
present. Let zt and Wg denote random variableswhose (joint) distribution function coincides
with the (joint) cross-sectiondistributions of the zt(t)'s and w(t)'s, respectively. Thus, for
example, z0 denotes the initial distribution of price deviations. Equation (4) then leads to:
(6)

= S—(S+m(t)+wg —ro) (mod A).

o

If no idiosyncratic shocks are present (wi 0 for all I) and
is uniformly distributed
on the interval (a, 8], then the distribution of price deviations, zj, is also uniform. The
level of trs(t) determines the relative position of firms within their cycle and the number of
times they have changed their prices, but it does not affect the shape of the distribution
of price deviations. CS showed that real balances and hence output cannot be affected by
monetary policy in this framework. A continuous increase of the money stock by Am leads

a fraction Am/A of firms to increase their prices by A. Thus the product of the fraction
of firms changing their prices and the size of these changes —the change in the aggregate
price index— is Am, leaving real balances (hence activity) unchanged.
Idiosyncratic shocks have no impact on the relation between money and output once the
economy is

at its steady state. Monetary neutrality follows from the fact that if the initial

continuum of firmsshould be interpreted as a notationallyconvenient way of dealing with a large but finite
number of firms.

distribution of price deviationsis uniform on (s, 5], then the distribution of prices at time
zt, is also uniform on (s, S]. Thisholds regardlessofthe distribution generating idiosyncratic
shocks, as long as its increments are independent from current prices. Intuitively, if prices
start off at their steady state and there is nothing systematic in the way idiosyncratic
shocks occur, then all these shocks effectively do is change the relative order of firms within
the (5,3) interval, without affecting the Irection of firms with price deviations within any

particular interval.
Next we allow the width of the (5, s) bands to differ across firms. Now some firms
have high costs of adjusting their price and therefore allow their price deviation to vary
considerably while others have small adjustment costs and change their prices more often.
The steady state distribution of price deviations (the z1(t)'s) is no longer uniform. The
variable that is uniformlydistributed is the fraction every firm has covered of its own pricing
cycle at a given instant in time. Formally, let c,(i) (S. — z.(t))/), denote the fraction of
its current cycle covered by the i-th firm at time i, and c denote the corresponding crosssection distribution. This variable takes values between zero and one. From equation (6)
it follows that

where A denotes a random variable with the same cross-section distribution as the As's. If

the initial position of firms within their cycle (c.(O) = (S — z,(O))/A.)is uniform, then it
remains uniform under rather weak conditions. All that is needed is that the (joint) crosssection distribution of bandwidths and increments of idiosyncratic shocks be independent
from firms' current positions within their pricing cycle, i.e. that (dim, A) be independent
from Ct. The proof is similar to the onewe sketched above. Neutrality of money is derived
by noting that equations (5) and (7) imply that

the proportion of firms changing their prices within each group (defined as firms with the
same A's) is inversely proportional to the width 1.f firms' inaction bands.
Adding strategic interactions and heterogeneityin elasticities does not affect the steady
state nature of the uniform distribution of Ct, since these only play a role outside the steady

state, when output fluctuates (see equation (3) and Section 5). The main result of this
section is summarized in the following proposition.

where fi denotes a random variable with the same distribution as the cross-section distribution of the /3's, and

r is a constant (that depends on fi, t, k, A and m(t)) equal to zero

in steady state.
Equation (9) shows that the cross-section distribution of firms within their pricing
cycle at time t is the sum, mod 1, of a distribution uniform on [0, 1) and a distribution
independent from the latter. That the resulting distribution again is uniform on [0,1)
under these assumptions follows from standardFourier analysis and is shown in Lemma B 1

in Appendix B. The conditioningargument given in the text can then be used to show that
output remains constant over time.

I

Thus, CS's steady state result can be extended to the case where idiosyncratic shocks,
different (S, s) rules and different demand elasticities are present. The aggregate behavior

of the correspondingeconomy —includingmonetary neutrality— is indistinguishable from
that of an economy with equal (5, s) bands and demand elasticities across firms, and without
idiosyncratic shocks. Yet at the microeconomiclevel there is an additional element of

(3) and it is
not obviousthat this system of equations has a solution. We first showthat an
equilibrium
exists under very weak assumptions (Section 4.1). This is followed by the derivation of
conditions that ensure uniqueness (Section 4.2). These conditions require that either the
degree of strategic complementarity across firms be small or that the economy be close to
its steady state. The section concludes with some speculations on what
happens when the
possibility of more than one equilibriumarises. The results we obtain should be viewed as a
first step towards understanding equilibria in dynamic menu costs economies with

strategic

interactions, since the fixed (5, s) rules assumption is (more) likely to be suboptimal in this
case.

In order to highlight the interrelation between the degree of strategic coinpiementarity
and the existence and uniqueness of equilibria, we assume bandwidths and demand elasticities are the same across firms. This section's results can be extended to the
general
macroeconomicframework consideredin Section 2, as was done in a
working paper version

This does not include the stochastic bands case considered in Benabou (1989]. However the principles
underlying the proofs in this paper are likely to extend to his setting.

Existence and uniqueness

Consider again the economy described in Section 2 and summarized by the equation
(10)

z(t) = S — (S + rn(t) + w1(t) + kf

A collection {p(t); i E [0, 1J} is said to define

a general equilibrium at time t, if the cor-

responding z1(t)'s —which are uniquely determined since the frictionlesseconomy always
has a unique equilibrium (see Appendix A)— solve the system of simultaneous equations
defined by (10). Thus determinig whether an equilibrium exists at time t is equivalent to
determining whether there exists a collection {z(t); i [0, 1J} that solves (10).
If {z(t); I [0, 1j} defines a solution of (10), then there exists a real number r(t) (equal
to z(t) di) such that

f

(11)

z(t) =

S — (S + ns(t) +

u(t) + kr(t) — p(0))(mod A).

Hence any two solutions of (10) differ only in the value of r(t) in (11). Thus if we compare
the cross-section densities of firms' positions within their price cycle associated with two
different equilibria,any one of them is a mod-i rotation of the other.e
Comparing equations (10) and (11) shows that proving existence of a solution at time t
is equivalent to finding a number r —that typically depends on the instant of time t being
considered—such that

where the r1(t)'s are given by (11), as a function of r. Let Y denote a random variable
with a distribution equal to the cross-section distribution of the (S + m(t) + w(t) — p(0))'s.
From (11) it follows that solving (12) is equivalent to solving the following (fixed point)
equation:

Equation (13) then shows that we may restrict our

that Gi(r) be continuous (in r). This is the case, for example, if the initial distribution
of prices and the distribution of idiosyncratic shocks are independent and any one of them

has

A calculationfrom first principles shows that under the symmetricequilibria assumption
(which implies that Y is concentrated at one point and therefore does not have a density)
the functions L(r) and G(r) do not necessarily cross. There often does not exist a solution

for (10) when this is the case. At the opposite extreme, when the economy is at its steady
state and Yj(mod.\) is therefore uniform, the constant r solving the fixed point equation is
unique and equal to zero, since output does not fluctuate (G,, =

= 0). This suggests

that uniquenessdependson how near the cross-section distribution of firms' positions within
their cycle is from the steady state.
Having established that an equilibrium exists (at time t) if Gj(r) is continuous, additional conditions ensuring uniquenessare now considered. If two values of r solve (13), then
necessarilythe slope of Gi(r) (as a functionofr) has to be equal the slope ofthe diagonal at
some intermediate point (this is just a statement of the Mean Value Theorem). Hence G(r)
is equal to —1 for some r. As G1(r) is periodic, its derivativeis equal to zero at some point.
Therefore there exists a unique equilibrium when G'(r) is continuous and G'r(r) > —1 for
all r. This is equivalent to having k(1 — h1(1

kr)) > —1 for all r in [Gm,Gm.,], where
Since the range of admissible values for k is (—1,+m),9

it follows that there exists a unique solution whenever there is strategic substitutability
(or no strategic interaction at all). The possibility of more than one equilibrium arises

(as shown in the appendix) is equivalent to dR(zt, U) < 1/k, where dR(zt, U) denotes the
largest relative error made in approximating the distribution of price deviations by its
steady state distribution.'0" The larger the degree of strategic complementarity,the closer

the distribution of price deviations must be to its steady state to ensure uniqueness.
The results on existence and uniqueness of equilibria are summarized in the following

Continuity: If the conditions ensuring existence hold for 0 t T,'3 there exists (at
least) a set {r(t) : 0 t T} defining a sequence of equilibria (see (14)) such that the

m(t) is differentiable and the conditions ensuring uniqueness also hold, then the (unique)
output path is also differentiable.

The conditions ensuring uniqueness imply that the right hand side of equation (15), as
a function of y, defines a continuously differentiable contraction mapping. This has two

interesting implications. First, since it is a contraction, standard fixed point calculations
can be used to calculate in an efficient way the value ofoutput at a given instant of time —
this is applied in the following section. Second, since it is continuously differentiable, the
unique value of r(t) defining a solution at time t (see (14)) —and therefore the distribution
of firm's price deviations— evolves smoothly over time. The dynamic behavior of the

Multiple Equilibria

economy is sufficiently far away from the steady state. The argument given in Section 4.1

to another. The economy's path prior to the time instant t may uniquely determine the
equilibrium it attains at time i. Multiple equilibria that persist over time must take into
account this dynamic consistency condition. This implies that a continuum of equilibria
must exist at some instant in time. A general statement on this topic is an open research
question.

OUTPUT FLUCTUATIONS AND STRATEGIC COMPLEMENTARITY
In this

section we study the economy's aggregate out-of-steady-state behavior. We
concentrate on the asymmetries introduced by strategic complementarity, and the desynchronizing features of idiosyncratic shocks. Even though many of the results extend to

the more general setting described in Section 2,15 for expository reasons we assume bandwidths and demand elasticitiesare equal across firms. We first consider the effect of strategic
complementarity in isolation and assume there are no idiosyncratic shocks (Section 5.1).

5.1

Strategic Complementarity and Fluct nations

We begin with a simple but illustrative example that motivates the issues we formalize later.

The economy is initially at the steady state described by Proposition 1, when an increase
io the rate of core money growth doubles firms' bandwidths.'6 Bands are symmetric before
and after the structural change. The cross-section distribution of firms within their pricing
after hands
cycle, which was uniform on [0, 1) before the change, is uniform on

[, )

widen.17 Both before and after the change in core money growth, the money stock increases
monotonically and continuously.

We first consider the case where there are no strategic interactions: firms' frictionless
optimal prices increase one-for-one with increases in the money stock because substitution
and income effects cancel. Firms' pricing decisions do not depend on the price level per
se, but only on the money stock. Since there is a gap between the distribution of firms'
positions within their pricing cycle and their trigger level, there is a period of time during
which no firm reaches its trigger point and nominal prices remain unchanged. This period
lasts until the (log of the) money stock grows by A/4. Real balances, and therefore output,
increase at the same rate as the muney stock during this period. By the time the first
firm reaches its trigger level —this firm was about to increase its price when the structural
change took place— firms begin changing their prices at a rate that is twice the steady
state rate, and therefore output decreases at the same speed at which the money stock
is growing. By the time the last firm completes its pricing cycle, the situation reverts
again and output increases at the rate at which the money stock grows. In the absence of
idiosyncratic shocks this cyclic behavior continues forever. The "curve" corresponding to

= 0 in Figure 2

of money growth is constant.
If money grows at a stochastic rate, output increases at the same rate that the money
stock until m(t) .A/4. Output then decreases —at the same rate that the money stock
is growing—until m(t) = SA/4, and so on. The frequency with which firms adjust prices
k

shows how output fluctuates when the rate

"This sxtreme example has the nice property: 1(O) — lc(O) = 0 (see below), which allows us to isolate
more clearly the effects arising from strategic complementarities from those arising from the shape of the
cross sectional distribution.
'TThis ignores the effect of the expected rate of inflation on the dsmand for real balances. Once this effect
is incorporated,the cross-section distribution of the c;'s continues being uniform on an interval of length
1/2 (as long as this effect is not larger than .1)4), hut this interval is not centered around 1/2. Except for
a shift in the time ails, the analysis that follows remains valid.

Figure 2: Output fluctuations with no idiosyncratic shocks

Next we consider the case with strategic interactions, to ensure a unique equilibrium
we assume k < 1. Firms' frictionless prices grow at a rate equal to a convex combination of

the rates at which money and the price level are growing. A firm's frictionlessprice is less
sensitive to increases in the money stock for larger values of the strategic complementarity
parameter k. By the same token, the speed with which a firm moves in its pricing cycle
becomes more sensitive to the changes in price level as k becomes larger. Following the
wideningof bands, thereis a period during which no firm adjusts its price, just as in the case
with k = 0. Since the price level remains constant, during this period, firms' frictionless

than in the case without interactions. Yet the corresponding increase in
real balances is amplified —by the presence of strategic interactions— into an increase in
output that exactly offsets this effect, and output grows at the same speed as in the case
prices grow slower

17

k = 0 for a longer period of time. By the time firms begin to adjust their prices, output
falls sharply. The price level begins to increase (at a speed twice as large as the growth rate
of money) and therefore firm's frictionless prices increase faster than they would if firms
only considered changes in the money stock. Since the cross-section distribution of price
deviations moves faster during the downturn, this period is shorter than it would be with

= 0. When all firms have completed their first pricing cycle, output begins to increase

k

and tbe cycle starts again.
Figure 2 shows output fluctuations when money grows at a constant rate, for various
degrees of strategic complementarity.55 Two regularities emerge from this figure and the
preceding discussion. First, output increases (decreases) when the rate at which firms are
changing their prices is smaller (larger) than the corresponding steady state rate. Second,
other things equal, output grows for a longer period of time —and declines for a shorter
period of time— the larger the degree of strategic complementarity. These insights hold
—in the absence of idiosyncratic shocks— for any distribution of firms within their cycle.
Later in this section we show that:

uniqueness), the numerator determines the sign of y'(t) and the strategic complementarity
parameter,

Ic, the magnitude of this rate of change.

The asymmetry described above implies that, other things equal, the average length of
expansionsis larger the larger the value of Ic. This is valid more generally than this example
may suggest. Given an initial cross-section distribution of firms within their pricing cycle,
c0, and a degreeof strategic complementarity Ic, let IE(k) denote the fraction of time output

that is independent from the current level of output. Then:

IE(k) — 1(k) = IE(O) — lc(O) + kdv(ct,U),

where dv(c, U) denotes a measure of distance —known as the variation distance—between
ct and the steady state uniform distribution U.'9 This result is proved in Lemma BIG in

Appendix B. It shows that the asymmetry in fluctuations grows (linearly) both with the
economy's distance from the steady state and the degree of strategic complementarity.2°
When the economy is expanding, most firms are at the beginningof their pricing cycle
and, other things equal, the larger the degree of strategic complementarity,the larger the
incentive firms have not to adjust their prices. Hence expansions are reinforced by the
presence of complementarities among firms, and their duration grows with k. Similarly,
contractions are associated with periods where firms change their prices at a rate faster
than average. When prices are strategic complements,the larger the number of firms that
change their price, the larger the incentivesother firms have to do the same. It follows that
contractions are shorter the larger the degree of strategic complementarity.
The magnitude of the effects described above is proportional to the difference between
the rate at which firms are adjusting their prices and the correspondingsteady state rate,
and this is proportional to the distance of the distribution of price deviations from the
steady state. This explains why the asymmetry between the lengths of expansions and
contractions increases with the distance from the steady state.

5.2

IdiosyncraticShocksand Fluctuations

When the economy is forced awayfrom the steady state described in Proposition 1, idiosyncratic shocks (whose increments do not depend on firms' current prices) bring the distribution of price deviations doser to its steady state and therefore dampen output fluctuations.

The discussion of this mechanism is given in Caballero and Engel [1991); and extended
here to incorporate the presence of strategic interactions. If shocks are nonstationa.ry, and
no structural change takes place, the cross-section distribution of firms' positions within
'5Tlie variation distance between c, and U is equal to supA Pr{c, E A) — Pr{U A}I, where the
supremum is taken over all Borel sets A. Note that, since there are no idiosyncratic shocks, dv(c,, U)
remainsconstant over time.
This qualitative nature of this result may be expectedto extend to the casewhece adjustment rules are
two-sided, as long as core-iiiflation is positive.

Figure 3: Output fluctuations and idiosyncratic shocks

Let us consider again the example where an increase in core money growth leads to a
doubling of firms' bandwidths. We assume idiosyncratic shocks are normally distributed
with zero mean and variance growing linearly with time.22 Figure 3 shows how output
fluctuates on its way to the steady-state in the presence of idiosyncratic shocks for three
different values of the variance, where time is measured in years.23 It is apparent form

this figure that fluctuations dampen out faster the larger the (instantaneous) variance of
firm specific shocks. Since shocks are non stationary, their desynchronizingeffect increases

follow directly from Caballero and Engel [1991].

without hound, hence output converges to its steady state level and the distribution of
firms within their cycle approaches the steady state distribution. The larger tlse variance
of idiosyncratic shocks, the faster the economy approaches its steady state distribution.
Figure 4 shows the path of output for three different degrees of strategic complementarity — and the same variance of idiosyncratic shocks. Figure 4 can be interpreted as the

that results from adding idiosyncratic shocks (with instantaneous standard deviation
equal to 0.05) to every one of the output paths considered in Figure 2. It is apparent that
the asymmetry between the lengtbs of expansionsand contractions persists in the presence
of idiosyncratic shocks — during the time period where the economy is sufficiently far away
from its steady state. This is consistent with equation (19). In the following proposition
figure

we extend equation (18) to the case where idiosyncratic shocks are also present.

Equation (20) corresponds to (18) with an additionsi term in the numerator. This
additional term takes into account the fact that now firms are moving within their pricing
cycle not only because of increases in the money stock, but also because of firm specific
shocks. As the economy approaches its steady state, both (1

and

f'(1) are

tending to their steady state values (zero). Since the monotonicityassumption implies that
the aggregate drift must be larger than the standard deviation of instantaneous shocks, the
first term in the numerator of (20) dominates over the second term, and the discussionfrom
Section 5.1 extends to the case with idiosyncratic shocks.

Summing up, when an (S, s) economy with idiosyncratic shocks is forced away from
the steady state described in Proposition 1, output oscillates on its way back to the steady
state. Expansions are flatter and contractions are more pronounced (but shorter lived), the

largerthe degree of complementaritybetween firms' pricing decisions and the further away
the economyis from its steady state.

AVERAGE NEUTRALITY

The previous section showed that monetary policy is generally not neutral when the
economy is outside its steady state. Yet knowledge of the level of output (i.e. of —(1 +
k)f zdi) over some period of time (so as to know its derivative) is necessary to take
advantage of non-neutrality. In this section it is shown that money is neutral on averoge
when there is no information on the location of the distribution of price deviations. This
serves as a threshold since any amount of informationbreaks the average neutrality result.25
We also show that the potential magnitudeof the effect of monetary policy grows with the
distance of the economy from its steady state. This ties in the various notions of distance

demand elasticities are the same across firms,se and that the cross-section distribution of
idiosyncratic shocks is normal (with a variance that increases with time).

where y(rn, t) denotes output as a function of the current money stock, in, and the distribution of idiosyncratic shocks accumulated until time t. This index is
shortsighted because it
only reflects the effect of money on the current level of activity.27 It also assumes that the
increase in the money stock does not affect the average growth rate of money, hence firms'
inaction range. It measures the effect of output of a infinitesimal, continuous increase in
the money stock.

From equation (5) it follows that is equal to minus (1 + k) times the derivative of

infinitesimal increase in the money stock has no effect on activity every time output reaches
a locally extreme (maximum or minimum) value and therefore is equal to zero at these

that Ms(L) is equal to (1 + k) times the largest

in Section 4 may now he interpreted in the following way. Once the (instantaneous) effect

of monetary policy,

as measured by M5(t), is smaller than (1 + k)/k, there exists

a unique

equilibrium.
Next we study to what extent an uninformed pollcy maker can take advantage of the
non-neutrality of money when the economy is away from its steady state. Assume that
the order in which firms change their prices is known, yet the exact position of any firm
within its pricing cycle is not known. This is equivalent to knowing the distribution of firms
positions within their (S, s) bands, except for a location parameter, b, that may take values
between 0 and A. The effectiveness

This means that if the policy maker assigns equal probability to all possible locations of the

distribution of firms' positions within their (5, .s) band, then monetary policy is neutral on
average. The magnitude of (infinitesimal) monetary shocks may be expected to be larger
the furtheraway from the steady state the economy is. A measure of the average magnitude

where dv(c, U) denotes the largest error made when approximating probabilities of events
under Zg by the corresponding
probabilityunderthe steady state distribution. This is the
notion of distance —known as the variation distance— related to the asymmetry between

the lengths of expansionsand contractions in Section 5.1. This asymmetry therefore grows
with the size of the potential effects of (infinitesimal) money shocks.
An alternative measure of monetary policy effectiveness at time I is the difference between the largest and smallest values output can take —from time I onwards— over all
possible continuous,increasing paths of rn(t). This leads to the following index of mone24

—

Average neutrality holds independently of how far from the steady state the economy
might be. Increasing money without worryingabout the current output level has no average
effect on output. The difference with full neutrality is that Mi(L), M2(t) and M3(t) —and

typically I— are different from zero when the economy is not at its steady state. Increases
in the money stock raise output during recessions but lower it during booms in such a

that these effects cancel each other. It may appear that this contradicts the result
we derivedin the preceding section, according to which booms are longer—and recessions
way

shorter— the larger the degree of strategic interactions. Yet, as shown in Proposition
3, the speed with which output grows during expansions is decreasing in the degree of
strategic complementarity. Similarly, the larger the value of k, the faster output falls during
contractions. These effects exactly cancel ofT the asymmetry between the lengths of booms

CoNcLusioN

This paper begins by generalizing Caplin and Spulber's [1987] steady state-money neutrality result, by allowing for strategic interactions and various sources of heterogeneity
across firms. We then proceed to study non-steady state dynamics, first showing that
whether a unique equilibrium can be guaranteed or not depends not only on the degree of
strategic complementarity but also on how close the distribution of firms' positions in their
price cycle is from the steady state. Next, we argue that strategic complementaritiesintroduce realistic asymmetries into the business cycle; the stronger these complementaritiesare,

the longer and smoother are expansions relative to contractions. Finally we demonstrate
25

that the conditional correlation between money and output is typically non-zero outside
the steady state, however the unconditional correlation remains zero. In other words, the
steady state neutrality result no longer holds for every time t but it holds on average.
Throughout the paper we assume that the band-policy remains invariant to the experiments we perform, and concentrate on distributional issues. For the most part, allowing
for different bandwidths for different parameters values is unlikely to change the qualitative
features of the

results. This is not necessarily true, however,

when we study the out-of-

steady-state behavior of an economy with strategic complementarities,since in this case

APPENDIX

A

This appendix briefly presents the basic model underlying the macroeconomic framework used in the paper.3° To shorten the formulae, the derivation from first principles of
the demand side of the model is omitted.
There is a continuum of sectors indexed by the subscript i E [0,1], and within every
sector a continuum of firms indexed by the subscript E [0,1]. Each sector faces at each
time i the following isoelastic demand function:

Y(i) the quantity of the (composite) good i demanded by consumers,q(t) the price

of the (composite)good i, Q(t) the aggregate price index, Y(i) aggregate expenditure, q(t)
the idiosyncratic shock to the demand for goods of sector i, and 0 the price elasticity of the
demand for good i.
Aggregate expenditure (equal to aggregate production in this model) is proportional to
real balances:

Y(t) =

30This is a modified version of Blanchardand Kiyotaki's [1987] (henceforth BK) model. One difference
with BK and other similar models, is that consumers are assumed to solve a two stage—CES—budgeting
problem within each period. They first decide how much to spend in each sector. Then they decide
how to allocate these expenditures within each sector. Firms do not collude, and hence do not exploit
the monopolistic structure of the first stage. This modification expands the parameter space (demand
elasticities) for which the results can be applied (an alternative way to achieve this is by changing the
elasticity of output with respect to zeal balances).

subindex j from now on:

it is assumed that M(0) = Q(0) and A = 1.
Working with the logarithms of the variables makes the algebra clearer. Therefore
the following notation is introduced: v(t) log Vj(t), m(i) logM(t), p(t) log q(t),
p(t) log q(t), P(t) logQ(t), r(i) p1(t) — P(i) andr p(t) — P(t), where p,'
denotes the (frictionless)optimal price. A simple Cobb-Douglasaggregate price index (i.e.
fixed weights) is adopted: P(t) f0' p(t) di.31
When a "menu cost" is introduced, firms follow some sort of (S, s) rule. The case of
fixed (S,a) bands, which is an approximation to the optimal pricing rule, is considered
here. They can be proved to be first best only in very special cases in the context of our
model. However, finding the true rule is technically very difficult and we have not yet found

a solution (we suspect that firms haven't either). Nonetheless, very interesting results can
be derived without questioningthe optimality of the proposed (S, a) rule too much.
An important role is played by the difference of the (log of the) actual price charged by
sector i and the (log of the corresponding)frictionless optimal price. The variable z(t) is

Simple algebra yields:

p(t) = (m(t) — P(t)) + qv(t) + P(t) + z(t).

Integrating with respect to i on both sides of (29), imposing that (since shocks are idiosyncratic) f0' v(t)di = 0, and using the definition of the aggregate price index, yields:

and

—z(t) + S =

S — (p1(i) — p;(0)) +

Let A = S — s denote the width of the rangeof percentage deviations of actual prices from
their frictionlessoptimum. Taking (mod A) on bothsides, and using the fact that

z() = S

It is easy to see that z(t) E (s, 5] since due to the properties of the modulus operator, the
second term on the right hand side of (32) belongs to [0, A).

equation of this paper:

Ptoor:

Since Y takes values in [0, 1], it suffices to show that its Fourier coefficients are
equal to those of a distribution uniform on [0, 1]. Thus it has to be shown that all non
trivial Fourier coefficients of Z are equal to zero. A calculation from first principles shows

that, given any random variable X, the Fourier coefficients of X and X(mod1) are the
same. Hence the Fourier coefficients of Y are equal to the product of those of X and U.
Since U is uniform on [0, 11, its non trivial Fourier coefficients are equal to zero. It follows
that all non trivial Fourier coefficients of Y are also equal to zero, completing the proof. I

Next we derive (36). Since the Fourier coefficients of X and X(mod 1) are the same,
it follows that the Fourier coefficients of X(mod 1) are summable and X(mod 1) has a
continuous density, fj(x), with bounded variation. ApplyingPoisson's Summation Formula
(see Butzer and Nessel, 1971, p.202, for the version being used here) leads to the expression
for fi(u).
