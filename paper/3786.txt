THE THEORY OF ALLOCATION AND ITS IMPLICATIONS
FOR MARKETING AND INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURE
ABSTRACT

This paper identifies a cost of using the price system and
from that develops a general theory of allocation. The theory
explains why a buyer's stochastic purchasing behavior matters to
a seller. This leads to a theory of optimal customer mix much
akin to the theory of optimal portfolio composition. It is the
of a firm's marketing department to put together this optimal

ob

customer mix.
A dynamic pattern of pricing related to Ramsey pricing
emerges as the efficient pricing structure. Price no longer
equals marginal cost and is no longer the sole mechanism used to
allocate goods. It is optimal for long term relationships to
emerge between buyers and sellers and for sellers to use their
knowledge about buyers to ration goods during periods when demand
is high. This rationing cam take the form of refusing to sell to
new customers and putting established customers on quotas. The
evidence shows that this form of rationing, though foreign to the
thinking of most economists, characterizes several industries.
The theory provides an important incentive for a firm to
exist, namely to facilitate trade amongst its customers. The
theory also provides a convincing explanation for the hostility
that new futures markets face from established firms in the
industry and shows that several practices, like price differences
amongst consumers and swapping product with rivals, can be the
result of competition and not market power.

Introduction

I,

Microeconomics is concerned with the efficient allocation of goods.

It is typical for economists to focus on the

price system as the mechanism used to achieve this efficient
allocation.

An impersonal auction system is often in the

back of most economistst minds when they think of efficient
resource allocation.

Other mechanisms to allocate goods

such as rationing are usually considered inferior to
system and are not given much attention1

a

price

The economists

exclusive focus on price comes from an implicit assumption
that use of the price system is costless.

After all, if it

is costless to use the price system to achieve an efficient
allocation,

why not use it?

This paper explains that economistst faith in the price
system is misplaced from the viewpoint of both theory and
evidence.

Prices alone should not be viewed as the most

efficient way of allocating goods in many industries.

The

paper identifies a cost of using the price system and from
that develops a general theory of allocation that has sig-

nificant implications for optimal allocation and industrial
organization, The theory explains the role of market making
and marketing -— and thereby provides an explanation for
important features of the modern corporation, such as

to the theory of optimal portfolio composi-

It is the job of a firm's marketing department to put

together this optimal customer mix.

A dynamic pattern

of

pricing related to optimal Ramsey pricing emerges as the
efficient pricing structure. Price no longer equals margim—
al cost and is no longer the sole mechanism used to allocate
goods.

It is natural and optimal for long term relation-

ships to emerge between buyers and sellers and for sellers

to use their knowledge about buyers to ration goods during
periods when demand is high.

This rationing can take the

form of refusing to sell to new customers and putting established customers on quotas.

This form of rationing, though

foreign to the thinking of most economists,
terize several industries,

as

seems to charac-

report later on.

The theory

provides an important incentive for a firm to exist, namely
to facilitate trade amongst its customers.

The theory iden-

tifies the incentives that firms have to invest in marketing
and plmnning.

Finally,

the theory provides a convincing

explanation for the hostility that new futures markets face
from established firms in the industry and shows that

swapping product with rivals, that are often associated with
market power can instead be the result of competitive market
forces.

This paper is organized as follows

Section II ex-

plains why it is wrong to regard the use of the price system
as free and presents some puzzling facts that do not accord

with the economic intuition from price clearing theories of
market behavior.

Section III develops the theory of optimal

allocation in the presence of a cost of using the price
system under some simple assumptions.

Sections IV, V and VI

examine equilibrium and show how to modify the theory so as
to relax several of its simple assumptions.

Section VI

explains how a firm can facilitate trade amongst its customers.

Section VII reports on empirical evidence that sup-

ports the theory.

Section VIII discusses the implications

of the theory for the role of marketing, choice of customer
mix, capital investment,

attitudes toward the development of

futures markets and swapping with rivals.

Section IX

presents conclusions.

is used to explain how price is set.

This auctioneer

doesn't even earn the minimum wage. All firms are assumed
to have access to the price mechanism that allows them to
costlessly market their goods. There is no need for long
term relationships between buyers and sellers and non-price
rationing never occurs.
Most economists recognize that there an relatively few
markets like the one I just described, yet this description
is the model that guides most economists' intuition. I will
soon describe why that intuition can sometimes be misleiding. Before I do that, it is worth emphasizing the costs of
setting up an auction market based on the few actual examples we have of such markets. Once the costs of setting up
an auction market are recognized, it follows irediately
that other allocation mechanisms may be superior.
One can learn a great deal about the cost of a price
system by

studying institutions whose business is

to create

such markets (see Carlton (1984))2. For example, if one

A significant fraction

of the economy of

the City of Chicago is devoted to the making of markets.

If

a magic spell could be cast to make transactions costless,

the Chicago economy would be devastated, at least in the
short run.

This emphasizes how far from costless the making

of markets really is.
Aside from the fact that there are costs to setting up
such markets, it is also true that many markets once created
fail.

Roughly one half of all successful futures narkets

fail within 10 years of their introduction
(l984)).

(See

Canton

Since markets clearly produce at least some bene-

fits to its creators, the high failure rate must indicate
the presence of significant costs of operation which outweigh these benefits.

Furthermore, only a small fraction of

products have ever had futures markets.

Again,

this empha-

sizes that there must be significant costs to the creation
of such markets, otherwise the benefits flowing from such
markets would suggest a proliferation of such markets.

But once it is recognized that it takes real re-

market clearing model.

I

have elaborated on some of this

evidence at length elsewhere (Canton (1986, 1989)), and so
only summarize the evidence here.
For what appear to be homogeneous goods,8 there is

often a very low correlation in price movements across buyers.

Moreover, buyers and sellers are often

married" to

each other for long periods of time (e.g. several years).
It is frequently true in some industries that price,

once

set to a buyer, does not change for periods in excess of one
or two years or more.

The degree of market concentration is

related to the rigidity of price.

There are frequent claims

in some industries that non-price rationing is occurring

when demand is high with regular customers receiving preferred treatment.9

Finally, the rise of the modern corpora-

tion in the late 1880's resulted in the need to have salesman and marketing departments whose responsibility was to

This contrsl feature of the modern corporation

is not easily explicable in a world in which goods can be

costlessly sold on an auction market.
III.

The Cost of Using the Price System

in the absence of an suction market, a firm that sets a

price runs the risk that it has set the wrong price.

If the

price is to low, too much is demanded and the firm has to
ration customers.

If the price is set too high, then too

few customers purchase and the firm is stuck with excess
capacity.

By the time the firm figures out whether it has

set the wrong price,

it is too late --

the

customers have

already gone (if the price is too high) or have placed their
order at the low price( if the price is too low).

This then

creates a real cost of using the price system to allocate
goods.

More precisely, because of uncertainty as to the

level of demand, the firm is unable to set the market clearing price.

The information set over which the firm can set

price ex ante is "coarser" than the ex post realizations of
demand.

(Later on, we see how this information set is

endogenously determined).

that there is a firm whose production technology involves a

Suppose that the customers of the firm in ag-

demand) or DH (the high state of demand) but the firm does
not know which of the two demand curves is applicable.

it creates a deadweight loss

when DL prevails.
If it charges a price below
XH it is
likely to create a deadweight loss when DH prevails since it
faces excess demand. For example, as Figure 1 illustrates,
if the firm charges

the firm would create a zero dead-

weight loss when DH prevailed, but would create a deadweight
loss of ABCD when
DL prevailed.

I will soon focus only on firms that compete with each
other to attract customers. The statement in the text
also holds true for a monopolist, provided the relevant
marginal revenue curves intersect the marginal cost
curve in its vertical portion.

the precise opposite of the as-

In the usual model, the price mechanism produces the

optimal allocation and simultaneously generates enough

Once there is

and the financing of the firm.

For example, the firm could

theoretically charge a zero price and achieve the efficient
allocation in the simple model just presented.

However such

a firm would not have any incentive to remain in business.

One solution to the firmts problem of raising sufficient revenue in the context of the preceding example is to
have the firm charge

A,

As long as price is less

no deadweight loss is created.

But

what if the revenue generated is not enough to cover the
fixed costs F of the firm and what financial incentives are
there for the firm to allocate efficiently?
In order to begin to address these questions, let us

make the model of the firm a bit more realistic.

The pro-

duction technology of the firm will still be constant returns to scale up to some capacity K and require the expenditure of

a

fixed cost F.

As before, there will be situa-

tions in which the firm must set a single price without
knowing whether the demand curve is DL or DR. If demand is
either DL or DH, we say that demand is in state 1, so that
state 1 contains two possible outcomes (low and high) for
demand.

As before, we continue to make the simplifying

assumption that the firm knows that its customers are identical so that the firm can, if it chooses to, achieve the
efficient allocation.

We also introduce another state of

demand, state 0, knowable in advance to the firm so that the
market clearing price can be set if the firm chooses to do
so.

The demand curve in state 0 is Do and is composed of

the same buyers as in state

1.

The configuration of the

demand curves in state 0 and state 1 is illustrated in Figure 2.

This is a variant of a standard problem in public finance.
The new twist is that the price in state 1 is independent of
whether the demand realization is DH or
DL.
The optimal solution to this problem is to use lump sum
taxes and marginal cost pricing or some other non-linear
pricing scheme.

As in the usual public finance context,

this perfect theoretical solution is usually impractical and

is not common.

For example, when buyers pay lump sum fees,

there are incentives for buyers to merge and aggregate purchases to avoid the lump sum fee.

Here, I want to examine a

relatively simple and common form of pricing, the charging
of unit prices that differ over demand states.

The motiva-

tion for studying this form of pricing is that in my earlier

Appendix, Theorem 2).

The model

I

have just worked out is a relatively simple

one but it contains three interesting implications.

1,

The amplitude of price fluctuations tends to be
smaller than that which would occur in the usual
market clearing model, with price being higher in
low demand states and lower in high demand states.

2.

Even under the perfect rationing assumption,
is

to raise revenue to finance the firm.

This

deadweight loss rises the greater the 'spread' of
the family of unobservable demand curves in each
observable state,

Analocous to theories in public

finance, it follows that the firm may use

linear pricing

non

schemes to finance its output.

reason for vertical integration arises, provided
the vertically integrated firm is better able to
enforce a non-linear pricing scheme among its
divisions than it could if it were charging nonlinear prices to independent agents.

The firm and customer benefit if there are more
products for the firm to 'tax.'

This follows

immediately from the theory of public finance
which teaches that the deadweight loss from raising a given amount of revenue declines as more

products are taxed.

Therefore, there is an econo-

my of scope in the financing of the firm.

This

economy of scope is unrelated to both production
and marketing considerations. A firm could
achieve this economy of scope if it sold multiple
products simultaneously or if it sold the same
physical product at different points in the business cycle to the same customer.

This economy of

scope provides one reason for buyers and sellers

to be 'married' to each other for long periods of
time.

The seller commits to supply the buyer and

the buyer commits to purchase from the seller over
an extended time period.

The implication is that

a steady customer may well be treated differently

than a sporadic one.

now describe the competitive equilibrium for the

simple model.

Equilibrium requires buyers and sellers to

contract with each other in advance for price and quantity.
The price and quantity allocations depend on the observed
state of demand.

Competition forces firms to offer a price

and ability to allocate that maximizes consumer surplus and
forces sirms to earn zero expected profits.18

18.

The equilibrium is a long run concept in which entry
erodes profits and all buyers and sellers are married.
A more general model could have an equilibrium in which
a steady strean of transient buyers appear, buy in a
spot market, end leave. These transient buyers would
bear the cost of using the price system and would pay
on average a higher price than the married buyers.

The curve initially rises because as the number of

increases the gain in utility from a reduced per

from having less output per customer to allocate.

Notice

that the allocative efficiency properties of a system with
perfect rationing could be identical to the (costless) price
system but for the financing constraint.

But the financing

constraint imposes a deadweight loss in each state of nature
because the tax causes a marginal distortion.

Therefore, as more customers are

the gain from being able to lower "taxes" saves more

deadweight loss when firms are using rationing (since existing average distortions are larger).

This creates an incen-

tive for these firms to be larger than they would be if
using the price system were costless.

This is especially

true the wider the divergence between the unobservable demand curves within any one observable state of demand because that is a situation with large marginal distortions.
Therefore, the number of customers served by a firm tends to
decrease as the cost of using the price system falls, and
there will be more firms.

In this sense, a costless price

system and atomistic competition go hand in hand.
B.

Monopoly
The monopoly solution is similar to the one just de-

rived.

A monopolist maximizes his profit by adopting

a

pricing scheme and quantity allocation that efficiently
allocates the goods he does sell.

Relaxing the Assumption of Perfect Rationing

The assumption that firms have the ability to perfectly
rank their customers' relative need for a good is obviously
unrealistic.

In reality,

a firm will have difficulty allo-

cating its output capacity, K, among its customers and will
not, in general, be able to duplicate the efficient alloca-

tion that would result if use of the price system were costless.

This means

that the firm relies less on price to clear markets in peak

It

also implies that prices becomes less procyclical as rationing ability improves.
Since customers are no longer assumed to be identical
and since the firm has some knowledge about each customer,
it follows that the optimal price and allocation policy

varies from customer to customer.

In an effort to obtain an

efficient allocation, the firm prices to screen out low
value demanders before it relies on non-price allocation
methods.

If a firm has different knowledge about each

consumer then the firm should charge each consumer a different price.

To understand this point, suppose that the firm is in a
neriod of shortage and that it has two customers.

The Role of the Firm

Facilitating

Trade Between Different Customers
This section explores in more detail the effect of
differences among consumers. The main point is to show how
a firm acts to facilitate trade amongst customers when there
is a costly price system and when the firm can identify

different groups of consumers. This function of the firm
has received little attention in the current treatments of
the theory of the firm.

It is a role that could reasonably

(Indeed, this solution is analo-

gous to one involving a two-part tariff.)
Now consider a firm that caters solely to Group B.
These customers have a finite demand elasticity in state 0,
so that, as in the previously worked out inodels, they wind
up paying a price in state 0 in excess of constant marginal
cost, c, and their consumption in the low state in state 1
is below that in the high state in state 1.

Compared to

firms catering to Group A, firms catering to Group B will

-

36

have less capacity per customer (K/N smaller) because they
are less efficient at raising money to pay for capacity.
The question we now address is whether a firm should
serve both customer groups on the assumption that the firm
can separately identify each group.

That is, is there an

economy of scope in serving both groups?
generally yes.

The answer is

To see why, consider state I.

We know that

in the case of a firm serving only Group B there is excess
capacity in the low state of state

1.

This excess capacity

arises because one consequence of a costly price system is
that the price in the low state of state

1

chokes off too

much demand.

Now consider
ers.

a firm catering solely to Group

A custom-

These Group A customers could well want to consume

more at a marginal cost of c than the amount that they are
currently consuming in that state.

Moreover,

the shadow

price of the Group B consumers in the high state of state 1
is higher than that of a Group A consumer (because K/N is

higher for the firm specializing in Group A consumers).
Hence, there are gains for trade if a mechanism could be
devised.

The obvious problem is that if the price system is

costly, it is hard for the two groups of customers to trade
in the two states of state

1

that by assumption

cant have

different prices because of the cost of creating markets.
It is precisely in this situation that the firm can step in

and facilitate trade between the two groups.

Recall that although a firm cannot charge different
prices to a customer in the two unobservable states of state
I,

the

firm can use its knowledge of customers' needs when

rationing is heeded.

The optimal arrangement is for the

firm to serve the two groups, to use some of the available
capacity of

a

Group B customer in the low state of state 1

to serve a Group A customer,

and to switch the consumption

of a Group A customer to a Group B customer in the high
state of state 1.

But how can the firm find It in its fi-

nancial interest to do this?

After all, it can't vary price

between the two states in state

1,

The answer is that the

firm can now raise (or lower) the (lump sum) tariff in state
o to Group A customers.

These Group A customers can be

thought of as "buying consumption in the low state of state
1 and

paying for it by "selling" consumption in the high

We have already discussed how R will be affected by the
number and heterogeneity of customers. As long as the need
for rationing persists, diversification is costly because it
affects R through the number of customers. This leads to a
finite firm size even in the presence of constant returns in
the building of capacity.

As a customer!s p increases, the

firm's ability to ration declines (because the customer adds

Group B values the good more than Group A and vice versa in

Group A would willingly join a firm that uses

between the high and low state in state 1.

The reason is

that Group B can "trade" with Group A if they are in the

The firm would charge Group

a price below c+F*

which allows them to expand their consumption in the low

This arrangement enables Group B to expand consumption

Again,

the firm is facilitat-

ing trade between two groups in a situation where the trade
could not otherwise occur because of the non-existence of a
separate price in each of the two states in state

VII.

Empirical Evidence

In this section,

I

report on some available empirical

evidence that supports many of the key assumptions and implications of the theory.

The main assumption and implica-

tions of the theory are as follows:

1.

It is costly to use the price system for some

goods so that rationing is optimal when demand is
high.

Customers will be charged different prices

depending on the stochastic nature of their demand.

For example, customers who buy only at peak

times may not be able to obtain the good with the
same reliability or at the same price as steady
customers.
2.

The amplitude of price fluctuations tends to be
smaller than that which would occur in the usual
market clearing model, with price being higher in
low demand states and lower in high demand states.

3.

The system Of market operation involving rationing
is not sustainable during extended periods of

Negative shocks do not raise the same problems because
rationing replaces the price system in state 1 only for
positive shocks.

chronic excess capacity.

In such

a

case, price

will fall to marginal cost because customers see
no benefit to paying higher prices to guarantee
supply in the future.
It is difficult to obtain systematic evidence on the

importance of non-price rationing from published data sources because it would be impossible to examine data

on price

and quantity and infer rationing. Instead we must rely on
evidence more akin to industry studies of particular industry and accounts in the business press.

of their demand.

For example, the Wall Street Journal re-

accepting no new customers and had placed quotas on their
deliveries to existing customers. Other industries where
non-price rationing has been reported include plastics,
computer chips, chemicals and various metals.22

The theory predicts that one determinant of a customer's price is the correlation of that customer's demand with

Schwieterman (1990)25 has tested this

theory for airline pricing.26

His findings are striking.

There is a strong relationship between fares and stochastic
demand patterns.

For example, someone travelling on a re-

stricted fare (Max Saver Fare> has a correlation with the
firm's demand of about one third that of other passengers
travelling on the sane flight.

The lower correlation

This airline case is a bit different from the model
since there is no long run relationship necessarily
between fliers and airlines (though frequent flier
programs attempt to create such a relation). However,
as long as tickets are purchased ex ante, the theory of
the model implies that a buyer's stochastic buying
characteristics should influence the price.

I recently had the opportunity to use confidential data
to test the theory for a manufacturing industry by

Implications for Firm Behavior

The models of costly use of the price system and costly
use of non-price allocations can be viewed as defining the
implicit technologies for allocation by price and non-price
methods.

Resources are used (i.e. costs imposed) when a

price system is used and when rationing is used,

Because we

know the technology used to allocate, we are able to understand the incentives to improve these technologies.

I be-

lieve these incentives lead to an improved understanding of
several aspects of the modern corporation, especially the
marketing function.

P)

Optimal Customer Mix

We have already seen in the previous sections how customers who place different demands on a firms rationing
ability are treated differently and have examined the

ir,cen-

tive of a firm to put together a portfolio of different
customers.

The theory here is akin to the theory of clubs

(Footnote Continued)
The econometric results relied on several thousand
monthly observations across several hundred customers
for a several year period.
The coefficient on p was
and positive.
The magnitude
statistically
significant
of the coefficient indicated that different stochastic
buying patterns of customers caused price paid to vary
by as much as 10 to 15 percent.

which the size and composition of the club affect each

member's welfare.

To understand the

advantage

of a desir-

able customer mix, suppose there are several customers whose
demands are random but are uncorrelated so that the sum of
their demand curves is non-stochastic.

This enables the

firm to avoid the problem of being unable to know which
demand state prevails since by construction the total demand
curve is always same.
In general,

when a firm is considering adding a new

customer, the firm calculates the additional cost that the

new customer would impose
others.

on the firm's ability to ration to

That cost tends to be greater the more positively

correlated are the demands of the new customer with existing
customers.

The gain to the firm is the additional revenue

(and hence reduced revenue burden on existing customers)
that the new customer provides.

It is the covariance of the

new customer's demand with aggregate firm demand that is the
key variable that determines how price is set to an individual customer.28 This theory of customer mix is analogous to
optimal portfolio theory.

It implies that "goods" are much

more heterogeneous than they may initially appear.

P pound

of product purchased steadily is a different product than a

pound purchased irregularly.

28.

It also implies that one goal

It is more complicated if the elasticity of demand
differs among customers. Moreover, the variance of
demand could matter if buyers are large.

the marketing department of a firm is to put together a

B)

Improving the Fir&s Ability to Allocate
The knowledge that a seller has of its buyers plays a

crucial role in determining
its buyers,

P..

The longer

a seller knows

presumably the better the ability of the firm to

use non-price rationing.

By assigning each salesmen fewer

customers or by sponsoring occasions wherein buyers explain
their needs to sellers, the firm can improve its ability to
use non-price rationing.

The firm can improve

its ability to use the price sys-

tem by improving its ability to distinguish among different

aggregate demand states.

By improving its overall sales and

marketing force, the firm can become increasingly refined in
its ability to discern different demand states and can

thereby charge different prices for the different demand
states.

By investing to refine its ability to distinguish

between various states of demand, the firm reaps the benefits of being able to use price to allocate goods at low

29.

Buyers could band together into desirable groupings or
be banded together by a third party (e.g. brokers,
middlemen> to achieve the same desirable result of
stabilizing demand. For example, advertising agencies
often package together different demanders for TV
advertising to produce a stable demand and then
purchase for these demanders blocks of advertising time
from TV networks.

cost.

-

That is, the firm invests in order to lower its cost

of using the price system.

The incentive to invest in order to use the price system more efficiently and to use non-price rationing more
efficiently explains the importance of the marketing and
sales function in modern corporations.

It is impossible to

tell whether a firm's investments in marketing are more

productive in improving its rationing ability or in lowering
its costs of using the price system.

A firm may rely more

or less on price as its marketing knowledge improves.

One

prediction is that a firm with many transient customers may
do better improving its ability to use price because it may
be easier to learn about aggregate demand than about customers' relative demands.

In contrast,

a firm with

a few

steady customers may find it easier to learn about relative
demands and improve its non-price rationing ability.

customers.

C)

Economies of Scope in Marketing
A seller's knowledge of a customer is an important

influence in determining R.

If the firm knows the relative

demands of a customer for one product, it may well have

into his relative demands for related products.

For

for both grass seed

and fertilizer during peak demand times.

Because of this,

there is a natural economy of scope in marketing, and it
therefore makes sense for a single firm to be in charge of
the non-price allocation for several products when the products are complementary. This economy of scope is likely to
be most important when inputs are used primarily for one
industry so that the demands for the various inputs are
highly correlated.

The knowledge spillover also creates an

economy of scope when the price system is used.
demands for different products are correlated,

As long as
the firm

selling both products can do a better job of using the price
system than a firm selling one product because the firm
selling both products is able to improve its overall knowledge about the state of aggregate demand about one product
by observing the demand of the other.

For example, market-

ing personnel may be able to pool information across prod-

ucts to better discern the current demand state of one product.

D)

Hostility to Futures ?4arkets
The knowledge that a firm possesses to use both price

and non-price methods to allocate goods is a valuable asset
and one on which the firm earns a return,

if an alternative

allocation mechanism were to appear, the firms valuable

- 50
asset would decline

in value.

-

Firms and organized markets

are competitors in producing "allocations8 and like any
competitor,

the firm does not like competition.

This phe-

nomenon explains the hostility firms often have toward the
introduction of a new organized futures market in their
industry.31

E)

Capital Investment
The marketing knowledge that the firm possesses to

distinguish different states of demand and to determine the
relative demands of customers will affect the firm's decision of how much capital to invest in.

I

expect that firms

with higher values for R will have a higher ratio of capital
to customers,

will earn higher profits, and will have more

customers than firms with lower values of R.

This suggests

that new firms that will tend to have low values of R will
have an optimal scale below that of an established firm with
a high value of R.
firms,

Moreover, in contrast to established

entrants will have to rely more on price fluctuations

to allocate goods despite the large deadweight loss that

such fluctuations may entail.

Entrants may also rely on

more flexible production technologies even if they are more

steadier customer demand.

F)

Swaps
In several industries,

equal tonnage basis.

firms often swap product on an

For example, a paper firm with a cus-

tomer in New York but a plant in California may swap 10 tons
of paper with a firm with a plant in New York but a customer
in California.

These swaps often do not involve prices but

do require equal tonnages.

In fact, personnel in charge of

arranging swaps may have little or no price making authority.

There has been many reasons given for these swaps.

(See Wiiliamson (1983) and Joyce (1983))

32
.

One reason for

swaps that emerges from the theory of this paper is that
swaps avoid requiring either firm to incur the costs of
ascertaining the market price.

This reason for swaps makes

sense only if prices are highly correlated in the areas
involving swaps and if it is not easy to determine the market price in each area.

This theory predicts that swapping

and non-price allocations are related phenomena.

In summary,

recognition of the cost of using both the

price system and non-price allocations helps explain the

of marketing in the modern corporation.

Marketing

consists of investments designed to improve a firm's knowledge about the level of aggregate demand and the relative
demands of customers. This improved knowledge lowers the
costs of using price and non-price methods of allocation.
Economics of scope in knowledge acquisition explain the
incentive for the firm to sell related products.

Conclusion

Relaxation of the assumption of costless use of a price
system leads to a theory with several implications for optimal allocation, market structure and industrial behavior.
The theory implies that rationing is to be expected and that
a customer's stochastic pattern of demand will influence his
price.

Marketing departments add value by putting together

a desirable portfolio of customers and by learning about

their customers'
goods.

The theory implies that one reason for a firm's

existence is to facilitate trade amongst its customers.
This theory explains some puzzling empirical evidence and
leads to an improved understanding of industrial structure
and the marketing functions of a firm,

Theorem 3:

The equilibrium size of a firm tends to be

larger with rationing as compared to the case of
costless use of a price system.

Proof:

The equilibrium

N occurs where average consumer

surplus is maximized. There are two effects
that determine the optimal N.

First as N

increases, the capacity available to satisfy the
needs of a single customer during peak demand
falls.

This represents a cost.

Moreover,

because demand curves slope downward, the
marginal loss from increasing customer size
increases as illustrated in Figure

A2.

The

marginal gain from increasing the number of
customers

comes from the reduction in the tax

burden that results as the fixed costs are
spread over more customers. The marginal gain
from reducing taxes is likely to be greatest
when there are already large taxes in place.
