CORPOP.ATE RESTRUCTURING AND INVESTMENT HORIZONS

ABSTRAC?

The recent wave of corporate restructuring in the United
States has been accused of shortening the investment horizons of

U.S. managers. This paper surveys the empirical and case study
evidence on restructuring and investment behavior and reaches the

following conclusions 1) A large fraction of the restructurings
were motivated by synergistic or other efficiency-enhancing reasons
and have little to do with investment horizons. 2) However, massive
shifts toward debt in the capital structure of manufacturing firms.
often induced by hostile takeover threats, are accompanied by
reduced investment of all kinds, particularly in a few industries

which are characterized by "stable' technology and cost-based
innovative strategies. 3) The evidence is consistent with
optimizing behavior on the part of firms faced with a lower
relative price of debt to equity and a higher overall cost of
capital during the nineteen-eighties, but there all still doubts
about whether the U.S. market for corporate control elicits the

correct level of long run investment. Thus the paper concludes
with a discussion of the evidence on cross-country differences in
the financing of investment and the market for corporate control
and suggestions for future research in this area.

CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING AND INVESTMENT HORIZONS
Bronvyn H. Hall

1. Introduction,

How are these two topics related? Corporate restructuring, whether
financial or otherwise, has been accused of shortening the investment

horizons of U.S. managers in the recent past. Put simply, the argument is
that takeovers or the fear of takeovers force managers to pay attention to
short-term earnings at the expense of long-term investments, and that this

bias increased during the wave of restrucrurings in the 1980s. Those making
this argument often point to the Japanese or German experience during the
same period as examples of market economies which have not experienced
substantial restructuring, and yet have apparently invested at a much higher
rate than the United States.

In spite of the prevalence and apparent plausibility of the view that
takeover threats induced by tha undervaluation or non-optimal utilization of
a firm's assets could lead to underinvestment in assets which have a longer
term payback period, it has proved difficult to find evidence that this is

the case in general. At the same time, restructurings do appear to have had
positive benefits in terms of short term productivity gains, profitability,
and "focus" (a movement away from diversification towards concentration on

the main line of business).1 This paper will probe the question in somewhat

begin by considering the nature of o rprtorerestruotutirg: whet is

it, and how is it done? I rake the term tr octet a whole rangs of

financial

structure (tie balance

sheet), or changes in the major lfnes ef "usiness in which tie firm

operates, Many of these activities ocur a the sane time, since ti-ey ar
sometimes mote easily performed in trdem. For example, a change in
ownership may be accompanied by the s'-lltng off of lines of businea.; to

finance the purchase, or by the rerirr rent of equity and issuance of debt in
order

to restructure the balance sheet

In fact, because of the

transactions costs associated with the change of control of a public
company, it is rare to find this event not accompanied by some other large

discrete change in the firm's stroc';rc since the need for small
adjustments in the firm's structure will not induce a control charge) -

However, these different motivations for restructuring have different
implications for investment horizons: feat of a control change and tOe
subsequent loss of job may cause managers to rave a shtrt-term focr, while
leveraging (changing the financial structurc ; say induce a decline it

investment simply because the cost of funds has riron, owing to the

reduction in free cash flow. A restructuring involving the divestiture of
old or the acquisition of new lines of business has no particular
implications for investment: it may incrrare, decrease, or redirect spending

on long-lived assets.2
For this reason, this paper focuses on the first two types of

restructuring: chsnges in financial structure, whether or not they are
accompanied by ownership changes. I divide these restructurings into two
basic types: I) substantial increases in leverage, either (a) accompanied
by a changc in control (e.g., leveraged buyouts, a majority of which are
also management buyouts, or going private transactions), or (b) with no
change of control (a substantial increase in the debt-equity ratio)

2)

takeovers not accompanied by a change in the financial structure of the
acquiring firm, whether friendly or hostile.
Defining what we mean by a shortened time horizon for investment is

somewhat trickier. Although is clear that the concept refers to the extent
to which longer term performance of the firm dominates over short term
considerations in the firm's decision making process, it is difficult to
make a mathematically precise definition which will satisfy all those who

have thought about the problem. Dne possible definition might make the time
horizon a simple function of the internal rate of return used by the firm in

evaluating projects. For example, f we ask over what horizon the firm
would be indifferent between $IDDD today and $1ODDD in the future, the answer

would be ID years if the requited rate of return were 2 percent per year
and 24 years if it were lD percent. Clearly these sets of numbers imply
quite different time frames over which the firm will look when evaluating
the payback of a particular investment and the weight which it will place on

2See Bhagat, Shleifer, and Vishny (l99D) and bichtenberg (l99D) for
evidence that acquisition and divestiture of lines of business during the
l9O5 was motivated to a great extent by the undoing of the conglomerate
wave of the iDa and 7Ds and was accompanied by productivity gains n the
core lines of business.

earlier, and the true payhack period is much longer.5 This hypothesis is
supported by the evidence of apparently high adjustment costs and a slow
rate of change for R&D investment.6 In the absence of inrecnal evidence on
the actual planning horizons of managers, this paper will consider that the
behavior of R&D investment in particular, and investment in general, serve
as proxies for the changes in investment horizons of corporations.
Before leaving the topic of investment horizons, I note thac one form
of long-term investment on the part of firms, investment in the education

and skills of its workers, is not explicitly considered here, Df course,
this type of investment is closely linked to investments in new technology
and innovation, but it is possible that changes in ownership and the
accompanying changes in employment which are documented here discourage
at least some firma from making investments in the human capital of their

workers.7 That is, a firm which expects to be taken over or which dosizes
under the threat of takeover may also fail to invest in its workers. My
reading of the evidence in the debate over the winners and losers in
corporate restructuring suggests that some of the private gains from this

the production of capital from investment is additively separable, as
is usually assumed for ordinary investment, a high deprecation rate implies
a quick payback to investment, and vice versa. However, if the production
of knowledge capital from R&D investment is not additively separable, as
seems likely, it is possible to show that a depreciation rate which is
measured as high when a conventional perpetual inventory specification is
used j consistent with very slowly decaying rates of return to lagged R&D
expenditures.

differences between U.S., Japanese, and German corporate practices with
respect to job tenure and firs-specific and firm-level training. Surely
part of the national institutional difference here can be accounted for by
the relatively more active market in corporate control in the United States,
which would reduce the incentives for nvestmenc, at least at the management
level.

2. The

Evidence on agf.tructuring

Irveetm.

There hae by now been quite a few studiee which document the results
of reatructurings which occorred during tho l970a and l9f0s. I focus my
attention on those which look at RAt invEarvent first. These studies are of

two types: large scale empirical atudica (Hall

and

Siegel

l990a,

199db, and

Smith 1981),

and

firms undergoing restructuring or acquiaitrrn

1988a,

l990a, Lichtenberg

case studies of a few large

(Miller 1990s,

1990h end

Fusfeld 1987).

I begin with my study (Hall 1990a) which is the most comprehensive on
the subject although limited in some dimonsions because it relies solely on

pullic data. The study is based on a complete universe of publicly traded
manufacturing firms (about 2500) from 1976 to 1987.

I identified every exit

from this sample (about 1200) during the eleven year period and traced the

reason why the exit occurred. This icformation, together with changes in the
debt-equity ratio of surviving firms, is used to identify firms
experiencing the major restructuring events.
In Table 1, I show the overall statistics or these events during the

pariod. The eleven year totals of the significance of these transactions
(neas:red by employment) suggest that about 30 percent of all firma were

involved, or 3 percent per year. About half of this is merger or

8Ehagat, Shleifet, and Vshny (1990).

acquisition between two public companies; only 9-11 percent is of the
leveraging variety, but the importance of the latter type of transaction

increases markedly during the later half of the period. In 1987, two
percent of the employees in publicly traded manufacturing firms were
employed by a firm which went private through an 120 or experienced a

substantial increase in leverage during the year. In my l990a study, I used
the sample of restructurings summarized in this table to investigate the
simple correlation between corporate restructuring and changes in R&D
intensity.

The major empirical findings of that paper were threefold: First, I
found that leveraged buyouts and other private acquisitions of publicly
traded manufacturing firms had taken place overwhelmingly in the sectors
where R&D investment and innovation have not been important, at least to the

industry as a whole. The industries and firms in question are those with
the steady cash flow necessary to service the debt, They are largely
smaller firms in the consumer nondurable industries (Food, Textiles, the
auto parts sector of the Motor Vehicle industry, the tire sector of the
Rubber and Plastics industry, and Miscellaneous Manufacturing) or those

which have been downsizing for some time under pressure from foreign
competition and reduced innovative opportunities (Textiles again, Fabricated

Metals, and Stone, Clay, and Class). Together these two groups of
industries accounted for over 80 percent of the LBOs and going private
transactions (as measured by employment),
The total amount of research and development spending of the companies
involved in eleven years worth of LEO and other "going private" transactions
is 767 million dollars, a small fraction of the 40 billion dollar industrial

R&D budget in 1982. Even If this R&D were to be cut drastically, it would

lava little icpsot on total R&D spending. i fact, although this R&D
disappeared from my aggregate statistics since rOe fines went private (sod
cease to report tc the SEt) I rited evidence from Rapan (19891) sod
hichteobetg and Siegel (199Db) that most ci these fitms did out tedoce theit

spendiog gteatly as a tesult of the transaction in any case,
My results concerning the nontechnology intensive charactar of LBOs

and "going private" transactions is now supported by several other studies,
which employ samples involving many of the same firms although using
different methodologies. These studies have also demonstrated increased
operating efficiencies and reduced inestment after the buyout. The primary
study of interest is that by Lichtenberg and Siegel (199Db), whioc relies on
a

different (confidential) source of data, the Census and Annual Surveys of

Manufacturing.
that LEts

Using a much larger sample than other studies, they found

have higher total factor productivity after the buyout then before

it and higher total factor productivity than other firms in their industry.

This was achieved by means of a substantial reduction in the nonproduction
worki roe (about 9 percent) while the ptoducticn wcrkforce declines very
slightly. The R&D of firms involved in b'xyouts was about 1 percent of sales,
while

that fot the average large firm in the sample was 3.5 percent of

sales. The difference in R&D intensities between the two groups of
firms

becomes slightly larger, but not significantly so, after the buyout.
ScrI. Kaplan (1989a, 198Db) and Smith (1989) report studies of large

MBCs during the early 198Ds; their samples are a subset of the 120a analyzed
by Lichtenberg and Siegel. These studies contain very similar findings:
there are substantial increases in profitability and cash flow post-huyout,

some cots n capital expenditures, and much of the gain to pre-buyout
shsreh"lders can be identified with tax savings. Both report that R&D is

8

largely immaterial (7 firms report it in the Smith sample, 10-20 in the
Kaplan sample); for these firms there are slight reductions after the

buyout9
Turning to financial restructurings which do not involve changes in

control, the second finding in my 1990a study was that the most dramatic
results of restructuring were found in those transactions where a firm moves
to a substantially higher debt position; here the size of the average
decline in R&D intensity was about 0.8 percent of sales (from 3.4 percent to

2.6 percent) for the 1982 to 1987 period. These results are in contrast to
those for leveraged buyouts, since many of these firms were doing

significant amounts of R&D beforehand. The result was robust in the sense
that it appeared both in a conventional investment equation and in the pre-

and post-transaction differences in R&D intensity. To my knowledge, mine is
the only study, outside of a few case studies, to look specifically at large
financial restructurings which are not accompanied by a change of control.
The third finding in my 1990a study was less clear: there was mixed
evidence as to whether acquisitions in the publicly traded manufacturing

were followed by reductions in R&D intensity. Firms which made large
acquisitions experienced permanent (at least over the horizon for which it
can be measured) declines in their R&D intensity relative to their

pre-acquisition R&D intensity; the mix of firms making acquisitions
also shifted toward firms with lower R&D intensities during the eighties, so
that the combined effect was substantially lower R&D intensities relative to

9The result cited is not actually in the Kaplan papers, which I reference
because they describe the data on which the result is based. It was
communicated to me privately by Steven Kaplan; it is measure of the
unimportance of R&D in the large-scale MB0 sample that he didn't even
mention it in the reported results.

period. Although the statistical evidence fer

of the substantial heterugeneity in firm behuvi. r, the size of the effect
was large in economic rerme, amounting 5c acne half cf one percent decline

turned out to be associsred wtrh the acquisiriors which were

accompanied or financed by increases i' leverage; char is they were a
manifestation of the sane correlation between increases in leverage and
falls

in R&D intensity described previcudly.
Table 3 summarizes the evidence icon my earlicr

paper concerning R&D,

acquisitions, and increases in leverage and includes new results for

ordinary investment for comparison. These new results demonstrate clearly
that the negative association between leverage and investment is not

confined to R&D investment. This table shows the results of a conventional
investment equation, estimated in levels and in a modified first-differenced

form (to control for permanent differences across firms).1D The table

Investment equatrons nmsed on an accerecetor model of cnvestment usually
include a measure of current output ma a proxy for expectations of future
demand. Those based on the Q theory of investment with adjustment costs
include the ratio of the market value of the firm's assets to the book value
as s proxy for expectations of the profitability of the firm's capital
stock. The potential existence of liquidity constraints (external finance
having a higher cost than internal) also suggests a role for current cash
flow or sales in the equation, beyond that due to demand fluctuations. The
equation which I estimated is an eclectic combination of these differing
(although not inconsistent) schools of thought. Tne dependent variable is
measured as a ratio both for theoretical reasons (linear homogeneity of the
production function and adjustment cost function) and econometric reasons
In the

first-differenced form of the equation, it is hypothesized that firms are
heterogeneous in investment rates in ways intrinsic to their technology and
unaccounted for by the model. For example, the R&D fnvestment rate in a
fast-moving electronics firm may be quite different in a permanent sense
from that of a firm in metal fabrication, If this fart is correlated with

verifies the main findings described above: a large negative impact on both
kinds of investment from increases in leverage, and an insignificant
acquisition effect for R&D, once leverage changes are controlled for. What
is new is a slight hint of reductions in ordinary investment following an
acquisition which is not accounted for by the leverage variables; however
this effect is measured very imprecisely (note the large standard errors in
the investment equation), and seems to be somewhat sensitive to the
specification (compare the first-differenced results)

The magnitude of the implied association between leverage and
investment in Table 3 can be interpreted in the following way: suppose a
financial restructuring occurs which increases the long-term debt of the

firm by the size of the capital stock (LB/K

1.0). In the year of this

event and the two years following, the total reduction in the
investment-capital ratio will be 0.05 (the sum of the three coefficients in
column 1 of Table 3) and in the R&D-capital ratio it will be 0,018. At the
mean levels of these variables (0.11 and 0.038 respectively) these are
enormous effects, implying reductions in the rate of investment of the order

of 50 percent. Note that the percentage reduction in both types of

variables in the regression (such as the market value-book value ratio), the
estimated coefficients of those variables will be biased. One possible
solution is to estimate the model

Before
researchers

leaving this topic, I briefly sunnarize the results of other
concerning the aftermath of aoquisitions. Lirhtenberg and

Siegel (l990a) look at a very large sample of ownership changes at the
plant level, which include LBOs (abou' 13 peroent of the sarple) and

acquisitions, both hostile and friendly. Central Office employment is

Th important finding for present

is that P&D employment growth is sustained ir, the face of

substantial reductions in ron-productic etrlcyment.
Healy, Palepu, and Ruback (1989) look at the 50 largest mergers for
1979 to 1983, and find that producti"ity improves, labor costs fall, and
investment and R&D rates are maintained; there are 33 R&D-performing firms
in

their sample. This work also documents the increase in leverage around

the time of the merger. but does not distcngnrsh. between hostile and

friendly acquisitions.
Unlike
Shleifer,

the previous studies, the interesting study by Bhsgst,

and Vishny focuses on hostile takeovers, whether LBOs rt not,

particularly white collar: accounting for 11-26 perceot of the premium; 3)
in the oil: gas, and timber industries, cuts in investment seem to have
been an important source of gains: but they could not find evidence of
inveatment cuts in other industries.

3. Industrial Sectors.
One way we might be able to learn sooething shout the interaction

between corporate restructurogs and long- term investment is by exsminstion
of the differences scross industries which use different technologies. That
is, industries in the manufacturing sector vary in the length of time it
tskes to develop s new product or process in wsys which are intrinsic to
their technology and we csn make use of this fact to develop insights into

the chsnges in investment strategies induced by corporate restructuring. In
this section of the paper I exsmine two questions: first, in which
industries did substantial LEO end leveraging activity occur, end second,
how do the investment regressions presented in Table 2 vary across

industries. To do this, I divide the renufacruring sector into four groups
of industries, guided by the Chandler (1991) triage into high, stable, and
low technology sectors ond en informal assessment of those industries which
are

likely to have long horizons for project development, end those which

can move more quickly.
The industrial sectors are the following: 1) High technology consists
of Phermaceurirsis (excluding Soap, Toiletries, and Cosmetics), Computing
Equipment, Electrical Machinery, Electronics, Aircraft end Aerospace, end

Instruments. 2) Low technology is Food, Textiles, Lumber, Furniture, end
Paper, and Miscellaneous Manufacturing (which includes leather, toys,

musical instruments, etc.). The third end fourth groups consist of

Chandler s stable tech--elegy sector plea the ron-pharmaceutical component of
the Chemical

industry.

1 incude the latter in this group both because it

apcaart t elr'ng wit the Petroleum Refining industry, and because its R&D
spending patterns are closer to the stable technology than the high
technology

incuatries, Thus the final rwo groups of industries are 3)

Stable Long Horizon, which consists of Chemicals, Petroleun, Primary Metals,
fngines and Construction Equipment, Hon-electrical Machinery, and

Autrmcbilea (excluding rotor vehtcle parts); and L Stable Short Horizon,
which consists of Rubber and Plastics, Stone, Clay, and Class, Fabricated

Meals, Soap, Toiletries, and Ceecetirs, and Mtot "chicle Parts.
In Table 3. I show the distribution of Levetoged Suyouts and large
leverage
First,

this may be partly due to the fact that these firms are also slightly
smaller than those in the ether sector 'except fec some young firma in the

high technology sector). However, this fact is very supportive of the idea
that leveraged buyeuts requite a low variance in cash flow and investment
strategies in order to be profitable.
In addition to the 76 positively identIfied LEOs in my sample of firms,
there are 148 transactions in which a firm is taken private through means

which are net specifically identified in my seucces as leveraged buyouts.
These are generally smaller firms (they average 2800 employees pet firm, in
contrast to LSOa, which average 9600 employees per fine) and probably

represent smaller transactions of the same type as an LEO. I show the
totals for these firms plus the LEOs (all going private transactions) in the

third panel of the table. They are clearly quite similar and only reinforce
the result: although only 36 percent of manufacturing employment is the
stable short horizon and low technology sectors, 83 percent of rhe
employment in firms which went private during the period is in rhese two

sectors. In addition, these firms are even less R&D-intensive than the LBDs
alone, For the U.S. manufacturing sector as a whole, R&D investment per
employee averages two thousand 1982 dollars; for rhe firms which were taken
private between 1977 and 1987, R&D investment per employee was five hundred
1982 dollars in the year or two before the transaction.
The second fact of interest is that stable long horIzon firms are
more than rwice as likely as firms in the other rhree sectors to undergo

huge leverage increases, g, unlike the other sectors, the firms for which
this occurs are almost as R&D-intensive as the crher firms in the sector.
This fact suggests that the pressure to restrucrure is not uniform across

sectors but is concentrated on sectors where icvesrmant is necessarily
long-term owing to its size or complexity, and where the technology is not
rapidly changing (in fact, rhe well-known "smokestack" industries).

Table 4 reinforces rhis view. It shows a simplified version of the
regressions presented in Table 2 for each of the four sectors and for the

manufacturing secrcr as a whole. The hypothesis that the coefficients are
rho same for all secrets is rejected at conventional levels of significance

(see the F-statistics shown in the table). A maser reason for rejection of
equality fur bcrh types of investment is the difference across sectors in

4, Case Studies.

-

The case study evidence, which consists of a few large transactions,
tends to support the findings of the large-scale empirical studies.3 Thete
are two major classes of transactions: the first is mergers between highiy
related latge firms, which are usually followed by no change or an increase
in R&D; the second consists of major increases in leverage or a leveraged

buyout induced by the threat of hostile takeover. These are generally
followed by cuts in R&D spending.
In the first group are several transactions in the petro-chemical
industry:

1) CD. Searle was acquired by Monsanto in 1987, after which R&D

was supported at the previous level with more emphasis on basic research.
2) Celanese was taken over by Hoechst in 1987; this firm was more willing to

engage in long-term R&D. Although Hoechst is a foreign firm, the laboratory
in the United Stares remained fairly independent. 3) Stauffer Chemical was
taken over by Chesebrough-Ponds in 1985, This was followed by a hostile
takeover by Unilever in 1987; although the company was disbanded, the
previous level of R&D was apparently maintained in the remaining divisions.

4) Conoco was acquired by Dupont Chemical in 1982. After the scquisrion,
R&D for the parent firm increased in amount and as a percent of sales.
Outside the perro-chemical indusrry,the other main acquisitions in this
group are the Ceneral Electric acquisition of RCA in 1987 (the main R&D

laboratory, the Sarnoff Laboratory was donated to SRI, alrhouh CE
maintained s contract with the laboratory) , and the Phillip Morris

acquisition of Ceneral Foods in 1985, which was followed by a rebuilding of

mttarp : this was followed by a reduction in R&D and a general shrinkage of

the firm. 5) USC Corporation increased its leverage in 1987, again as a
takeover defense, and shortened its R&D horizon from 5-6 years to 3 yesms.

3) Cwens-Illinois undsnent an LED in 1987 to avoid a hostile takeover; efter
the LBC, R&D was emphasized more. &) Coodyear Tire and Rubber Co. wes

lrahn in 1985- it responded by forming a joint venture with Coodrich to
develop tires, and cu' its own R&D spending as a result of this, but its R&D
Intensity was never hi1i. to begin with

There are two perro-chemical companies in this second group: the first
is Phillips Petroleum, which leveraged in 198 as a defense against a
hostile

takeower attempt by Boone Pickens. The firm made substantial

cuts

in R&D personnel, although nor out of line with the shrinkage of the rest of

the firm. toort-tera payoffs were emphasized, although some analysts regard
the former Jr"el of R&D as wasteful, and view the Phillips case as a good

18

example of the free cash flow theory at wotk.4 The second is Union
Carbide, which restructured in 1985 to reast a takeover by GAF Corporation.
As part of the restructuring they sold an R&D facility; but moved the R&D
into the divisions and did not reduce the intensity.
Finally we reach the only two cases in the case study litetature which
seem to represent high technology being threatened by hostile takeovers:

Datapoint and the best-known, Polaroid Corporation. The hostile takeover of
Datapoint by Asher Edelman in 1985 appears to have been a technology
disaster; since the customers desetted the fitm owing to a lack of

confidence in the longtun viability of its technology. R&D and investment
were cut by almost fifty petcent, but this is one case where increases in
leverage were not the cause; the firm has also remained in the publicly

traded sector. Because the firm was shtinking, the R&D intensity did not
fall much, and in 1987 Datapoint paid it first dividend. It is not clear
whether to interpret this as a successful shrinkage of an unprofitable
technology company or a failure to invest where there were good
opportunities.

In the case of Polaroid, aging technology and a high tate of R&D
expenditure with little apparent payoff made the firm vulnerable to hostile

takeover attempts. In 1986, leverage was increased as a defense, and R&D
intensity reduced slightly, although management claims that leverage was not

the reason for the reduction, It still is not clear whether the shift in
strategy has been successful.
In reading over the descriptions of these restructurings (except for

Datapoint and Polaroid), one is struck by several facts: first, the

one expects the strongest or -cI etition from foreign flb r vcth l'wer coss,

and one cannot help tI inking that the reason the p' s"rr tr restructure has
been dirroted towards these industries has soosthing to do with
over investment.

When taken together with the atatistroal evidence of the previous
section,

the case study evidence is very suggestive. It appears that the

moat negative avert for investment is the defense of a hostile takeover,
which is usuali.v r"oompanied by a debt for equity swap. Takeovers as a
whole are frequenthy friendly, between firma in highly related

industries, and not followed by inveatmen" outs. The case study evidence is
also

consistent with the industrial srtor level results presented earlier:

the market for corporate control and the pro. sures for reduced investment

are centered on the stable technology sac t r, ' articularly on those
1'5Note that the oaae atudy evidence ignores a few industries, in particular
Food and Textiles, where substantial restruoturings lava occurred. ThIs is
because the focus of this evidence was the questr'n of R&D investment, and
little is done in those industries. What is in"rrratinl is the fact that
even when we focus on R&D-performing firms, the oas rtudias are do'sinated
by firms in medium or stable technology induatrieo ran "r than high

industries which are viewed as having "long horizon" technologies.
It is clear that, at least for this sector, the raiders' view that the
previous investment strategies were misdirected and excessive was shared by
the capital markets (were this not true, the hostile bid would not have been

large enough to succeed in changing the firm's strategy). In this, they are
much like the l.BOs and M6Os documented by Kaplan (1989a, 1989b) and Smith

(1989), Unfortunately, unless one is s doctrinaire believer in efficient
markets, this evidence is not enough to persuade one that all the

investments foregone were unprofitable. "The path not taken" is difficult
to evaluate.

The finding of reduced investment following leverage increases or
takeover threats is also consistent with two other pieces of evidence which
attempt to evaluate the frequently heard statement that the negative impact
of mergers and acquisitions extends to firms which ate not involved in them
(via a kind of demonstration effect).
Ashmute (1990) studied the behavior of 37 potential targets (identified

by a financial analyst who published the candidates in Grimm's) relative to
a control group of firms who were not targets. He found that the targets
reduced their R&D and investment to sales ratios, and increased their debt

in the year following identification by Grimm's. The total effects were
shout 1.6 percent (s fall from 4 to 2.4 percent) in the R&D-sales tstio and
2.0 percent in the investment-sales ratio. It is not clear from his work
whether the larger increases in debt of the potential targets are a

combination of many firms with no change and a few with large changes from
resttuctucings.

6. International Comoarisons.
We

have leatned some important iacts about the effects and rocivat t

of resrructurings from the research reported here and elsewhere. The
results have more often been positive than negative for the firms involved,
and

have frequently confirmed the hypotheses of those who argue. that the

market

for corporate control is an important discplino device for managers

in the United States. However, the survey of the evidence in sections 2

through 4 of this paper baa had very little to say about the econoxyvide

effects of the recent wave of restructurings. That is, even if the
redirection of firm strategies and investment has been profitable for the
firms involved, we are still not sure whether there might be a better paeh
to

long term productivity gains.

Thus, the discussion n the previous section does not imply that we
should

be sanguine about our current economic structure and its promotion ci

long- term investment; besides the obvious macco-economic problems which

have led to high interest rates and the inherent, subsidy of debtte lativete
equity in our tax sys ten., it is conceivable that the atmosphere of
insecurity which attends the market fur corporate control in thta cnuntey
has a more negative effect on long- term investment strategiea than has heen

found in the studIes to dote.
In any came, even if we do not believe that the recent wave of
corporate restructuring has been rho

e of investment declines, t,e.rc

remains the question of whother out market system for corporate control is

capable of generating the correct level of long-term investment from the

of a profitable and productive industry Roughly speaking, chase

countries (including the United States) can he divided into wo groups: the

A simple way to characterize the difference between the two systems

uses Hirschman'a (gfl)

exit/voice

dichotomy: in the U.S. and U.K.

shareholders who are dissatisfied with management's performance tend o sell
their shares, often to a higher bidder who may change the management team or
otherwise reorganize. That is, the shareholders "exit" when things dr'n't go

the way they want. In the Japan and German systems, and to a lesser extent.
the French, there are major shareholders (particularly banks and, in Japan,

other firms in long term relationships with the firm in questor) who tend

191n this connection, aee the recent paper by Foley and Lezoniok (1999),
which uses an endogenous growth model (a model where innovation sp1ls over
to other firms) together with market miapricing of innovative firms to show
that lower costs of takeover can lead to an equilibrium growth rate for
labor productivity which is lower than the one which would be assooiaed
with higher takeover coats.
see the discussion in Hall (l990a), which cites Grilichea (1951),
Gookburn and Griliches (1987), Hall (1988b), Jarrell, hahn, and Mart
(1985),ond Woolridge (1988) for evidence that at least the stock market

The evidence for thia diatinction ia in Edwards and Fischer (1991)
Edwards and Eisenbeis (1991), Franks and Mayer (1990), Kearer (1991), Mayer

and Alexander (1990), and Hoahi, Kashyap, and Scharfatein (1990). For
example, although the level of takeovers appeara to be almoar as high in
Germany and France as in the UK, the incidence of hostile takeovers (which
are generally more likely to be a form of management diacipline) is much
lower, as is the incidence of 1.aos.21 Franks and Mayer attribute this bcrh
to the fact that the regulations concerning the employment of msnsgemenr snd
others are stricter in Germany and to the fact that shareholders rights seem
to be somewhat less in both France and Germany.
Franks and Mayer also cite substantial institutional differences
between the three countries, centering on the role of banks in Germany or

monitoring orgsnimsrions. Banks have significant shareholdings in other
corporations, also hsve voting rights associated with the bearer shares of
private investors, and they sit on the supervisory boards of
Akreinzesellschsfts (German corporations or AGs for short) .

This

role for

banks in the monitoring of firm behavior is paralleled in Japan, according
to several writers (Hodder 1955, Hoshi, Ksshyap, and Schsrfstsin 1990).
The conclusion which Franks and Moyer draw from their study is thor the

21The U.K. has experienced the same explosive growth in LEG activity as the
United States, with the total annual value of transactions rising from less
than 100 million pounds before 1980 to 3.7 billion pounds in 1988. This
tremendous growth has been achieved with a somewhat lower use of debt than
in the United States. The timing of the increase raises interesting
questions shout the tax motivation story for bROs since the U.K. has nor

both in the resources used et the time of takeover and in the scorrrerr
thinking which they claim it engenders

They also argue that cbrsea ir

owtership undermine the ability of firms to sustain a reputation for

1mg-term relationships." Alternative institutions for monitoring tie
investment strategies of firms may he preferred to the conrincove uc on
implied

by the takeover market because they are less costly with rerecr to

the development of long-tero relationships and investments.
This conclusion is supported somewhat by the results in Fe' hi, Mae,

and Scharfsrein (19ff, 1990), who show that investment ct th f'rm loyal in
Japan is resprrs'vm to liquidity (crab flow) wlco the f5rr J a not ha e

longrun

banking relationship or does not belong to a t1ru,

but not

otherwise. They interpret this to mean that banks with large shareholdngs
in firms are capable of monitoring them more closely than onrsde investors
and that this mitigates the asymmetric information problem that crises when

firma seek external finance, They support this with a finding that firms in
keireraus ar with strong ties to a main bank invest and sell more than orer
firms when they are in a financially distressed stare.

It is important to realfze that although Japan end Germany hcve in
common the absence of a strong market for corporate control, the nature of
the relationships between firms and their banks seem to be somewhat
different, Edwards and Fischer (1991) doc'erenr the apparent weakness of the

supervisory role which banks play for large German firma: although they
hold proxy rights for roughly half the shares in the 100 major AGe the
supervisory board typically meets only twice a year, and the banks have only

10-20 percent of the seats on the board, in addition, unlike Japan, barks
era not a major source of finance for firms;

30

Mayer (1990) reports the

following shares of bank lending in the net financing of nonfinanoial

enterprises 1970-1985: UK 7g. Germany 121, US 24.2, France 37.3, and Japan

5Q422 There the German banks appear to be most important is in the lending
to and monitoring of small and medium-aired firma (Mayer and Alexander
1990) .

The moat important feature of the system may not be the actual

monitoring performed by the banks, but the institutional features (for
example, employee representatives have 50 percent of the seats on the
supervisory boards, removal of the supetvisory board requires approval of 75
percent of the shareholders, and managers are appointed for five year terms)
of the German system, which tend to make hostile takeovers difficult (and

very uncommon)

It

would be quite interesting to repeat the Hoshi, Kashyap, and

Scharfstein teat of differences in liquidity constraints with data on German
firms; although the keiretau institution does not exist in Germany,

firms does (Edwards and Fischer 1991). 1 am unaware of any current research
of this kind, although there has been similar work on the U.S. and U.K. ara
which attempts to measure the importance of liquidry constraints for
investment at the firm level by olasaffying firma into financing regimes
based on their dividend and new share issue policies (Hall 1991 for the

U.S., Bond and Meghir 1990 for the U.K.). Although both sets of authors
have rejected investment models which do not incorporate liquidity
constraints with their data, this work is still too preliminary and fragile

Table S of this paper, along with some of my own for U.S. and Japanese

expenditures and stock building. The data are from the GEGO Financial

of retained earnings as a

of finanoe for invesment, and

the rolative unimportanoe of Thng'term bonds (exoept in the U.S. nere a
third of the debt ie honda). to Table 3, I have assembled sore nua'tera
(herb from my own data cod from those of other researchers) which desori're

"he marginal sources of finance in four countries for the nonfinanclal
oorprrate seotor as a whole, and for the approximately 100 largest
msn'faoturinq firra in eaoh o"urtry.

My st"erp"" cn—o'te these numbers for Japan and the United States
revealed that no-'comparabiliry in a000unting methods across oountniee may

render this kind of comperison extremely difficult to perform. For example,
I am unable to determine gross debt and equity changes from the Japanese
data available to me, which does not identify a full statement of charge in

financial position In the U. S. data for most firms, the net sources and
uses of funds are not equal to rero, even approximately which meats there

are

some sources or uses overlooked in the data. Also in the United Statce,

a large fraction of net finsnce does not cove from any of the conventLonal

sources, bun roves from the net sale c invstoent and plant and equipment,
as well as fror the "other' category cf rho sources of funds, This fraction
has increased between the seventies and the eighties, another symptom of the
restructuring and divestitures which have taken place.

Besides the importance of retained earnings in all countries, the

second feature which stands out in Table 5 is tha" for the non-financial
corporate sector as a whole, the pattern of financing In the U.S. looks more

like Japan than the U.K.: the United States and Japan rely far mete heavily
on debt then do the U.K. and Germany. If true, the faot that average
incremental financing prcportions do not reveal a dichotomy between the U.S.
and U.K. on the one hend, and Jepen and Germany on the other suggests that

the story is not a simple one: were it simply the case that U.S. firms
could not finance investment externally, we would expect the financing
proportions to differ, but in fact, the U.S. looks more like Japan, except

that a larger proportion comes from new equity rather than new debt.2 For
differences, we must lock to the uses of funds, rather then the sources.
Here i em hampered by the incompleteness of the Japanese date, although the
German date does suggest that fcc less of the money goes to finance

acquisitions then in the U.Kjhayer and Alexender 1990).
To sum up, the international evidence in this section, although

incomplete, puts us back where we started: there is s strong feeling that
long- term investment strategies are difficult to implement in an environment

where managers fear losing their jobs or firms if they experience bad draws

for a couple of years, but little hard evidence, The primary evidence that
there is a better way is Japan, but it does not seem realistic to argue that
if shareholders rights were reduced in the United States without changing
anything else that this would have a significant effect ott investment

strategies. There are surely other reasons why Japan is different.

rsrionsl Are there politically acceptable (fessible) policies which would
inhibit such behavior?

T do not believe that the evidenoe on investment horizons snd corporate
restruoturing implies or justifies speoifio strong policy reoommendstions.
The market for corporate control is an important msnagement discipli'k' d'v',ce

and the reduction of shareholder rights by antitskeover legislstion widen
the substitution of mn alternative supervisory mechanism would be likely m
allow firms to diverge even further from the private (or public)

value-ssxirizlng path. It does not seem believable thst managers, as r
are more likely to

inoorporste

the social welfare funotion in their cIsc-org

thsn ahsr1rolders. To put it another way, although it may be the case that
the Jap-nose or German system of oorporate governance results in longer
investment horirona, I do not think that halfway messurea or partial moves

in

that direction would be successful in producing suct o result, a-rd a whoisssle

installation of the entire bank monitoring end fnterlcrking corporate oyster

34

in the United States is simply not feasible fot complex histoticel, legal end
political reasons, The one institutional change that might succeed is a
relsxetion of the testtictions on shateholdings by banks (see Edwatds and
Eisenbeis, this volume).

On the othet hand, this paper (end othets) have pointed to two features
of the U.S. economy which seem to have increased the incentives to increase

leverage and reduce investment in the recent past: the implicit subsidy in
the corporate tax system towards debt finance, end the level of interest rates

(or the cost of capital) during the nineteen-eighties. I think thet both the
modern theory of corporate capital structure and the evidence here suggest
thet the tax effect will tilt the firm toward the use of more expensive

external finance for investment, end the interest rate effect will cut both
the level and the horizon of that investment. Policies which change these
orices, tether then institutional structures, ere mote likely to succeed in
lengthening investment horizons. It is not that institutional structures are
unimportant, but they etc extremely diffcuit to modify in ways whose results
ste predictable, end without incurring substantial transactions costs. In any
case, therm is evidence that the Japanese and Oerman systems of corporate
finance and governance are moving towards ones that look more like outs

(Kester 1991, Hoshi, Keshyap, end Scherfsten 1988, Hodder 1985), which
suggests that some sort of hybrid system is better, at least on evolutionary
grounds.

There are several areas in which future research on this topic should he
conducted, end questions which should be probed more thoroughly. With the
existing date, it should be possible to refine the investigation of major

leveraging

35

events, now that these have been dentiiU? as associated wi& the aajorit

of investment declines: first, the iden'ifiraticr of such everos and 1e
causes

(such as takeover threats) of

em

ould be greatly rnprcve

Second, the consequences of the red.zctions in fnvastnent or other

redirections ought to be examined over a lorger term than has beer d'ne o
date; we now should have evaileb] e over five years of data for
restruotorings during the 1984-1986 period.

A second area of investigacion centers on the results in Tables

and 4

of this paper, which call for a more detailed industry-level investigation
of certain sectors which seem o have experienced °he most presa':rc. from

restructuring does the cost of capital approach xplain what ha-pe-.er ir
these se-tots? Are the surviving firms strorger and what has ]apted to
their investment strategies? To the extent posstble this reseerch should
also

address the "unobservable investment" question in more detail.
Finally, I think the empirical evidence on international comparisons

has barely scratched the surface of the question to date. Neither tie
sources and uses of funds comparisons, which seem to suffer from aevere
measuretent difficulties nor the role of banks in monitoring firms (ortprra
the conclusions in Franks and Mayer 1990 with those in Edwards and Fisccec
1991 concerning the role of banks in Germany) seem to be completely

understood. With the exception of Noshi, Kashyap, and Scharfatein on Japac.
little has neen done to relate this work to investment strategies aoroas

companies at the level of the individual firm, Further work of this kind
would shed more light on the question of the optital form of corporate
governance systems.

High Tech:

Pharmaceuticals (except Soap and Toiletries>, Elec.

.

These are leveraged buyouts plus approximatery ISO transactions where a
firm was taken private without being identified in the data sources
specifically as a leveraged transaction. These are generally smaller
firms.
A leverage increase occurs when a firm increases its long-term debt in a
single year by an amount which is 100 percent or more of the beginning of
year sum of debt plus equity.
