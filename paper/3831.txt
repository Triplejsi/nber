ALCOHOL CONTROL POLICIES AND MOTOR VEHICLE FATALITiES

ABSTRACT
The purpose of this study is to estimate the effectsof drunk
driving deterrents and other alcohol related policies on drunk
driving. The data set employed is an annual time-series of state
cross-sections for the 48 contiguous states of the U.S. from 1982
through 1988. Total and alterative alcohol involved motor vehicle
fatality rates, for the general population and for 18 to 20 year olda,
are used as measures of drunk driving. The results indicate that the
moat effective policies are increased beer taxes and mandatory

administrative license actions. Maintaining the beer tax at its real
1951 value would have reduced fatalities by 11.5 percent annually, on
average, during the sample period. A mandatory administrative license
sanction of one year would have reduced fatalities by 9 percent. The
next most effective policies are a 21 year old legal drinking age,
preliminary breath test and dram shop laws and relatively large
mandatory fines. These policies each reduce total fatalities by about
5 to 6 percent. No plea bargaining provisions and mandatory license
sanctions upon conviction are also found to have some deterrent

effect. Other drunk driving laws tested include mandatory jail
sentences and community service optiona, illegal per ae laws, and open
container laws. None of these were found to have a deterrent effect
on drunk driving.

1. Introduction

Since the mid-1970's, the Federal and various state and local governments have
campaigned to reduce motor vehicle fatalities by discouraging alcohol abuse. One part of

this campaign was the Alcohol Traffic Safety Act of 1983. This act provides financial
incentives for states to enact and enforce new, more stringent drunk driving laws. These
measures include certain and more severe penalties upon conviction for drunken driving, an
easing of the standards required for conviction, and the increased allocation of resources for

the apprehension of drunken drivers. A second part of this campaign was the Federal
Uniform Drinking Age Act of 1984. This act pressured all states into raising the minimum
legal drinking age to 21 for all alcoholic beverages. States that were slow to respond were
penalized by having part of their federal highway funding withheld. Ross (1990) reports that
between 1980 and 1990 over 500 new drunk driving laws were passed in the United States.

These new drunk driving laws are intended to both punish and deter. The deterrence

effect depends on the assumption of rational behavior. While driving when drunk may not
he rational, the joint decision to drink and then drive can be modeled as a rational decision.
Becker (1968), assuming rational behavior, describes the deterrent effect of legislation in a

model of expected utility. Becker shows that the number of offenses committed by an
individual is negatively related to the cost of each offense. The cost of each offense is a
positive function of the probabilities of arrest and conviction and the severity of punishment

if convicted.

The purpose of this study is to estimate the effects of drunk driving deterrence laws

and other alcohol control policies on drunk driving. Prior research does not provide an
unambiguous assessment of the effects of these laws. Many early studies used interrupted
time series analysis which may not be the most appropriate method for studying the effects

of drunk driving laws. Also, most of these studies consider only one law. This study is
important because the effects of all major drunk driving laws, as well as those of minimum
legal drinking ages and alcohol excise taxes, are estimated simultaneously. The second novel

aspect of this study is the use of an estimated, alcohol involved driver fatality rate. This
variable was constructed using information on the blood alcohol concentration of drivers

killed in fatal crashes. An annual time-series of state cross-sections is used to estimate these

models. This type of data set is important since it allows for estimation of more subtle
effects than can be detected with a univariate time series.
Several recent studies have examined the effects of various drunk driving laws, Ross

(1985) reviews a number of these studies and concludes that laws which increase the
perceived certainty of punishment have a short term effectiveness. However, he concludes

that the laws have little impact in the long run due to a decline in the public's perception

that the laws will be enforced. Ross (1984) also reviews research on deterrents in the
United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. He finds

that there is evidence of a deterrence effect in these countries, the magnitude of which
varies with the perception that the laws will be enforeed.
Mosknwitz (1989) also reviews several studies of drunk driving deterrence laws and

concludes that the deterrence approach has litrle effect on behavior. Drunk driving laws,
according to Moskowitz, are useful to the extent that they communicate the community's
concern about the problem.

Evans, et. al. (1989) use a cross sectional time series data set for 48 states over the

period from 1975 to 1986 in their study of seven anti-drunk driving laws. They examine
preliminary breath tests, sobriety checkpoints, no plea bargaining provisions, mandatory jail
sentences, illegal per se and open container laws, and administrative license sanctions. None
of these measures, with the possible exception of breath tests and sobriety cheek points, are
found to have any effect on motor vehicle fatalities. However, they defined all drunk driving

deterrence laws as dichotomous variables and only estimate fixed effects models. The
resuhing eollinearity between staLe and lime dummies and their dichotomous law indicators

may mask the effects of the laws.
Zador, et al. (1988) study the effect of per se laws, adinirsistrative license action laws,

and mandatory jail or comntunity service laws using cross sectional time series data for the

48 states from 1978 to 1985. All three laws are found to have a significant negative effect
on highway fatalities.

Saffer and Chaloupka (1989) use a cross sectional time series data set for 48 states
over the period from 1980 to 1985 to examine the effects of preliminary breath test laws.
2

Using a variety of fatality rates and specifications, they find that the preliminary breath test
significantly reduces motor vehicle fatality rates.
Kenkel (1990) studies The effects of preliminary breath tests, mandatory penalties,

administrative per se laws and no plea bargaining laws, using a micro data sd taken from

the 1985 Health Interview Survey. The outcome measures are self-reported alcohol
consumption and self-reported drunk driving. He finds evidence that these laws, with the
exception of the no plea bargaining law, deter heavy drinking. However, holding the effect
of the laws on heavy drinking constant, no independent effect on drunk driving is observed.

Kenkel's results also lend some support to the notion that is the joint decision to drink and
then drive which can he modeled as a rational behavior.

Il. Empirical Specification
The empirical model is derived from a theoretical model consisting of two equations.

The first equation is a production function relating the probability a fatal motor vehicle
accident (ir) to an individual's alcohol consumption shortly before or while driving (y) and
a vector of additional variables (z).

= ir(y,z)

(1)

The a vector includes variables which measure traffic density, roadway conditions, vehicle

quality and other motor vehicle safety measures. The second equation is the demand for

alcohol shortly before or while driving:

y=y(p,a,c,f,l)
(2)
which is a function of the price of alcohol (p), the prohabilities of apprehension (a) and
conviction (e) for drunk driving, a vector of the penalties associated with apprehension and

conviction (I), and a vector of other variables affecting alcohol demand (I). The vector I
includes income, the prices of alcohol complements and substitutes, laws affecting the
availability of alcohol, alcohol sentiment and other measures of taste.

Substituting the alcohol demand equation into the probability of a motor vehicle
fatality equation yields a reduced form probability equation:

ir=ir(p,a,c,f,l,z)

(3)

which can be aggregated across individuals to yield an empirically estimable probability of
3

a motor vehicle accident fatality equation.

ilL Data
The data set employed in this study is a time series of state cross sections for the 48

contiguous states of the U.S. covering the years from 1982 through 1988.1 Means and
summary definitions of all variables are found in Table 1.

Motor vehicle fatality rates are the best empirical measures of drunk driving
available.2 While not all motor vehicle fatalities are the result of drunk driving, there is a
strong correlation between the two measures. Several alternative fatality rates, based on the

information contained in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA)

Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS), are employed to measure drunk driving. The
FARS contains data on all motor vehicle accident fatalities by state of occurrence.

The first fatality rate includes all motor vehicle accident fatalities and is called the
total fatality rate. In an attempt to focus on alcohol involvement in motor vehicle fatalities
and in isolate the impact of the DUI laws on driver behavior, two additional, driver specific
fatality rates are defined. The first driver specific fatality rate is limited to drivers who died

between 12:00 a.m. and 3:59 a.m., and is called the night driver fatality rale. The NHTSA
estimates that 75-90% of these drivers had been drinking.
The second driver specific fatality rate uses the information contained in the FARS
on the blood alcohol concentration of drivers killed in fatal crashes. No other study of dronk

driving employs a fatality rate constructed from these BAC data. Since the BAC data is not
collected for all drivers killed in a fatal accident, the alcohol involved driver fatality rate was

estimated. This fatality rate is based on the fraction of the dead drivers tested and the
fraction of those tested with I3AC's of at least 0.05%, based on most states definition of
alcohol involvement.

In addition, three similar, age specific fatality rates are defined for youths ages 18

1
Masks and Hawaii were omitted from the data set because several important variables were missing
for these two states. The Oistrict of Columbia is excluded because its else and nature make it likely that
many of its motor vehicle accidents invoWe nooresidents.

Fatality data is preferred to accident data due to the variability in reporting standards across states for
accident data.

4

years to 20 years.3 Alcohol involvement in motor vehicle accidents is estimated to be three

times higher in the 18 to 20 year old group than it is in the overall population. It is,
therefore, particularly important to examine the effects of alcohol regulations on this age
group.

Each fatality rate is computed as the relevant number of motor vehicle accident

deaths divided by the relevant state population. The fatality equation is specified as a
logistic equation. The logistic functional form is ideal since it constrains the fatality rate to
lie between zero and one. The logistic specification is obtaioed by transforming the fatality

rate to ln[M/(1-M)], where M is the fatality rate and in is the natural logarithm. Maddala
(1983) shows that weighted least squares should be uscd with this logistic transformation.
The weight is LnM(1-M)J, where n is the relevant state population.

An extensive set of variables are included as indicators of the various state laws
related to alcohol use and/or driving under the influence of alcohol. These laws include:
implied consent laws; illegal and administrative per se Laws; minimum legal drinking ages for

alcoholic beverages; preliminary breath test laws; open container laws; no plea bargaining

laws; laws specil'ing mandatory minimum penalties for conviction of driving under the
influence; and dram shop statutes or case laws. These laws represent all important DUI

legislation.1 All law variables were constructed from the information provided in the
NHTSA's annual compilation ADigest of State Alcohol-Highway SafctlLRelated Legislation.

An implied consent law presumes that an individual with a driver's license agrees to

be tested for alcohol and other drugs upon request or face a license suspension or
revocation. This law is modeled with two variables: a dichotomous indicator of whether or
not a state has a statute calling for a minimum driver license suspension or revocation upon

first refusal to submit to a blood, breath, or urine test for alcohol; and the length, in days,

'Several other fatality rates were also cooso-ucted from the FARS data. Results for these can be found
in Grossman, Sailer, and Chaloupka t1991).

'An additional measure used irs other studies which represents an increase in the probability of arrest

is the use of roadside sobriety checkpoints. Based on conversations with the NI-ITSA, the roadside
checkpoints can not be captured in the data employed in this study due to the use of sobriety checkpoints
in all states and the lack of data on how extensively checkpoints are used within a stare.

5

of the mandatory license suspension or revocation associated with the first refusal (zero for
states without a first refusal implied consent law). Through 1988, 38 states and the District
of Columbia had implied consent laws with suspensions or revocations from 30 days to one

year.

Illegal per se Laws make it no offense to operate a motor vehicle with a BAC at or

above some specified level. Under these laws, a BAC at or ahove the specified level is
sufficient proof to convict an individual for drunk driving. The only relevant rebuttable
evidence is that the test was administered incorrectly. Through 1988, all but 6 states had

illegal per se laws for BAC levels ranging from 0.08 percent to 0.12 percent. Three
dichotomous variables are defined to capture these laws. The first is one if a state has an
illegal per se BAC of 0.08 percent, and is zero otherwise. Similar variables are defined for

a BAC of 0.10 percent, the most common, and for a BAC of over 0.10 percent. The
omitted category is states with no illegal per se laws.
Some states have also enacted administrative per se laws which may require the state

licensing agency to suspend or revoke an individual's license after arrest for DU!. In many

states, this action is mandatory when the individual's BAC exceeds a specified level
(generally 0.10 percent). The administrative action is independent of any later court penalty.

Two variables are defined to capture these administrative license actions. The first is a
dichotomous indicator equal to one in states requiring an administrative license suspension

or revocation for the first arrest for DUI, and is zero otherwise (including states allowing

discretionary administrative sanctions). The second is the mandatory minimum license
action, in days, associated with the law (zero for states with no mandatory administrative
sanctions). Through 1988, 15 states had mandatory, administrative license saneLions of 10
to 180 days, effective at BAC levels ranging from 0.08 percent to 0.13 percent.

The state minimum legal purchase age for beer, alcohol content greater than 3.2
percent, is included in all estimated equations. By the end of the sample period, all states
had minimum ages of 21 for all alcoholic beverages. However, many enacted grandfather
clauses when raising their drioking ages, exempting state residents of legal age prior to the

increase. The drinking age measure employed in this study accounts for these clauses.5
Finally,

if a state raised its legal age during the year, the drinking age variable is the

weighted average of the ages in effect during the year.'
The preliminary breath test variable is a dichotomous indicator equal to one if a state

has a law authorizing the pre-arrest use of a preliminary breath test to establish probable

cause for arrest for DUI, and is equal to zero otherwise. These laws allow the police to
administer the breath test without the assistance of medical personnel. Through 1988, 25
states had statutes allowing the use of a preliminary breath test.
•

In several states, it is an offense to have an open container of an alcoholic beverage

in the passenger compartment of a motor vehicle. Open container laws arc modeled by
including a dichotomous variable equal to one if a state has an open container law and equal

to zero otherwise. At the end of 1988, 21 states had open container laws.
In the past, an individual charged with DU! might negotiate a plea bargain to reduce
the charge to a non alcohol-related offense, such as reckless operation, carrying a less severe
penalty. To eliminate plea bargains, some states now require prosecutors to try an individual

for DUI if they are arrested for 001, unless a written statement is filed indicating why the
charge should be reduced. This is modeled by a dichotomous variable which is one if the

state has a no plea bargaining law and is zero otherwise. Through 1988, twelve states
restricted the use of plea bargaining in DUE cases.
Additionally, several states have dram shop laws which allow a person injured by an
intoxicated individual to bring suit against the person or establishment serving the alcoholic

beverages. This variable is one if the state has either a statute or case law clearly
•

authorizing such a lawsuit and is equal to zero otherwise. 35 states had such statutes at the
end of 1988, with case laws in an additionat 4 states and the District of Columbia.

Thts was done by taking a weighted average of the daily effective drinking age in the state. For
example, in a state raising its drinking age from 20 to 21 on January 1st, but grandfathers individuals 20

years of age prior to January 1st, the average drinking age for the year would be: 20+at i)/365'.
'Saffer and Grossman (1987a,b) find that drinking age related youth border crossing is an important
determinant of youth motor vehicle fatality rates from 1975 through 1981. Similar variables were included

in the equations presenred below. However, these had little impact in this sample, probably due to the
unifonnicy of drinking ages and the fact that the grandfather clauses pertain to stare residents only.

7

At the end of 1988, 35 states and the District of Columbia had laws calling for
mandatory minimum penalties to be imposed upon the first conviction for DUE These
include dollar fines, driver license suspensinn or revocation, and jail sentences. In some
states, more than one penalty may be imposed. Additionally, some states allow an individual

to engage in a minimum amount of court approved community service in lieu of a jail
sentence. Eight variables were defined to capture these mandatory sanctions. Separate,
dichotomous indicators were defined as one in states requiring a mandatory minimum fine,

license actinn, nr jail sentence upon first conviction for DUE An additional dichotnmous

indicator was defined for states allowing community service in lieu of jail. Finally, four
continuous variables were defined for the mandatory minimum penalties; the fine, in 1967
dollars; the license sanction, in days; the jail sentence, in days; and the community service,

in hours. These variables are zero for states which do not require the relevant mandatory
penalty. Through 1988, 16 states had mandatory fines for the first conviction ranging from

$50 to $500. Similarly, 24 states and the District of Columbia either suspended or revoked

an individual's driver license from 15 days up to 1 year. Finally, 15 states mandated a jail
sentence of from 1 to 3 days, with 9 of these allnwing from 8 to 100 hours of community
service in lieu of the jail term.
Ideally, the impact of penalties for drunken driving would be modeled empirically hy

three variables;
a-1 = a0 + a1D + a5D1S + a3(1-D1)S
(4)
where r1 is the fatality rate in state j, D is the dichotomous indicator of a mandatory
minimum sanction in state j, S is the mandatory minimum sanction in statej, and S is the

discretionary average sanction in states with no mandatory minimum penalties. Thus, the
impact of the sanction is shown by a2 and a3, with the effect allowed to differ depending on

the nature of the sanctinn. The impact of requiring a mandatory penalty, implying greater
certainty of punishment, is shown by a1. Comparing the average fatality rnte in states with

a mandatory minimum penalty (irM) to that in states imptming discretinnary rather than
mandatory penalties (irM):

irk=a3+a1+a2SX

(5)
(6)
8

where S" and S° are the average penalties imposed in each type of state. Hence,

ir"-r° a1+a,S"-ct)S.

(7)

The problem, however, with estimating equation (4) is that no data is available on
.1

the average penalties imposed in states with no mandatory minimum penalties. Assuming

that average penalties in stales without mandatory minimums do not vary, unbiased
•

estimates of a5 can be obtained from:

8 + B1D + a2D1S.
(8)
where 8 = a0 + a5S0 and B = a1 - a5S°. Thus, the impact of more severe mandatory
minimum penalties can be found directly from a2, but the effect of having a mandatory
•

minimum penalty can not be found without information on the average penalties imposed
in states without mandatory penalties, If more severe mandatory minimum penalties act as

deterrents, as expected, a will be negative. However, the sign on B, the coefficient on the
indicator of a mandatory penalty, is ambiguous. a. is expected to be negative, since having
a mandatory penalty increases the probability of a penalty and, as a result, the expected cost

of drunken driving, a5, though, is also expected to be negative, since increased avenge
penalties for drunken driving are expected to deter individuals from driving drunk.
•

This model applies to the mandatory minimum fine, license sanction, and jail sentence

variables. In addition, the estimation of equation (8) for an implied consent law provides
both the impact of having an implied consent law and the effect of the mandatory minimum
•

penalties associated with the law, since states without implied consent laws impose no
penalties upon refusal to submit to tests. Finally, a slightly more complicated version of this
model applies to administrative per se laws.

In all equations, the price of alcohol is measured by the excise tax rate on beer.
Excise tax data are the most reliable price data available. Beer tax data were chosen since

beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage in the U.S. and because meaningful wine and

distilled spirits taxes are only available for states which permit the sale of all alcoholic
beverages in licensed establishments. The beer tax variable is defined as the sum of the

Federal and state excise tax rates on a case of 24-12 ounce containers of beer, in 1967
dollars. The Federal tax had been fixed at 64 cents from 1951 until recently when it was
doubled as part of a deficit reduction package. State excise tax rates were obtained from
•

9

the U.S. Brewers Association's annual Brewers Almanac. If a state raised its tax during the
year, the tax is computed as the weighted average of the rates in effect throughout the year.

Five other alcohol related variables are included in all equations as measures of
unobserved exogenous sentiment towards alcohoL For example, anti-alcohol sentiment
should be relatively widespread in states in which religious groups opposing alcohol are

prevalent or in states in which a higher than average fraction of the population reside in
counties prohihiting the sale of alcohol. Thus, variahles are defined for the percentages of
the state population who arc Mormons, Southern Baptists, other Protestants, and Catholics.
These data were available from Lhe National Council of Churches for 1971 and 1980 only.
Estimates for 1982 through 1988 were computed by logarithmic trend. The final sentiment

variable is the percentage of the state population residing in"dry" counties, taken from the
Brewers Almanac.
Failing to control for sentiment may bias coefficients on the deterrence measures and

the other determinanLs of alcohol demand. For example, states with strong anti-drinking
sentiment may enact high alcohol taxes and drunk driving deterrent measures as part of the

political process. Thus, if sentiment is excluded from the fatality equations, the estimated

coefficients on taxes and the drunk driving laws overstate the effects of these variables.
Alternatively, states with pro-drinking sentiment mighL enact higher taxes on alcohol, since

these are a good source of revenues. If this is the case, then the estimated tax coefficients
understate the true effects of taxes when sentiment is excluded.
Real per capita personal income and the state unemployment rate are also included
in all equations. Income should be positively related to the demand for alcohol and health,

as well as to the quality and condition of motor vehicles. Thus, the predicted effect of
income on fatality rates is ambiguous. Unemployment may be a stress factor increasing
alcohol consumption, but may reduce driving because of reduced work related travel, as well

as lead to lesa drinking away from home. The unemployment data are taken from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics' Oeogrphical PLof,leJf Employment and Unemployrncnt.
Additionally, five variables are used to control for the probability of a fatal motor
vehicle accideot. They are the percentage of highway traffic exceeding 65 miles per hour,
the number of vehicle miles traveled in 10(1,000's of miles per licensed driver, the fraction
10

of licensed drivers ages 24 years and under, a dichotomous indicator for states requiring
annual safety inspections of all motor vehicles and a dichotomous indicator of a mandatory

seat belt use law. The first three of Lhese variables were computed using data from the
Federal Highway Administration's Hiahwav Statistics, and unpublished data provided by the

FHA. The safety inspection indicator was taken from the American Automobile
Association's Digest of Motor Laws. Finally, information on mandatory seat belt use laws
was obtained from communications with the NHTSA.
Vehicle miles per driver reflect molor vehicle usc and traffic density and should be
positively related to fatality rates. According to Peltzman (1975), because young drivers have

a higher demand for risky driving, they are more likely to have an accident than older
drivers. Thus, an increase in the fraction of young drivers should have a positive effect on
fatality rates. Similarly, vehicle speed should also have a positive effect on fatality rates, with

deviation from the average speed also having a positive effect (Lave, 1985). Thus, an
increase in the percentage of drivers exceeding 65 mph on highways should lead to higher
fatality rates. Ukewise, mandatory safety inspections should result in safer vehicles and, as

a result, lower fatal accident rates. Lastly, increased seat belt use resulting from the
mandatory seat belt use laws should reduce the probability of a fatal accident.

Finally, temporal variation in unmeasured variables and other time trends are
modeled by a set of dichotomous variables for each of the years from 1982 through 1987.

IV. Regression Results
•

A- Introduction
The empirical specifications are designed primarily to address problems associated

with an extensive list of potential independent variables. There are 11 drunk driving laws
that have been identified by NHTSA as important legislation. Several of these Jaws must
be modeled with two or more empirical variables. Also, many of these laws were enacted
at the same time. The number of variables and the simultaneous enactment of the laws can

create collinearity in the data set. Collinearity problems may be reduced by limiting the
number of variables in the models. The exclusion of correlated variahtes, however, can
cause omitted variable bias in the coefficients of the included variables. One approach to
these two problems is the estimation of several specifications using different combinalions
11

of drunk driving laws. The estimation of three fairly different sets of specifications provides

the means to judge the robustness of the results with respect to the problems of eollinearity

and omitted variables. There are six regressions in each specification set. In each set, the

regressions have different dependent variables but the same independent variables. The
results are presented in Tables 2 through 7.'
The first set of specifications includes only one drunk driving law along with the

control variables. These specifications are preseoted in Tables 2 and 3, and are labeled
Single Law Specification. Each panel in these tables represents a separate regression in
which only the coefficient(s) for the drunk driving law is presented. There is no collinearity
between the drsjnk driving laws since only one law is included in each regression. However,

eollinearity between the included drunk driving law and other alcohol control policies could

still be a problem. Also, excluding the other drunk driving laws may create an omitted
variables bias.
The second specification includes all drunk driving laws. These results are presented

in Tables 4 and 5, and are labeled Extended Specification. These models are important
since they minimize omitted variables bias. They are, however, sobjeet to collinearity since

many of these laws are enacted jointly.

The third specification includes the control variables and a limited set of drunk
driving laws. The results arc presented in Tables 6 and 7, which are labeled Limited
Specification. These specifications attempt to provide a balanced solution to the problems
of collinearity and omitted variables. These models reduce collioearity since they include
fewer dronk driving laws than are included in the Extended Specification. The laws included
in the Limited Specification were those that consistently matched a priori expectations in the

prior specifications. The drunk driving laws included are the preliminary breath test, no plea
bargaining, dram shop, administrative per se, and maodatory fine and license sanction laws.

These models also reduce the problem of omitted variable bias relative to the Single Law

Of the other specifications tested one set merits some additional attention. Arteospts were made to
estimate fixed effects models by including dummy variables for all but one of the states in the sample, as
welt as an sdaptatioo of Searte's (1971) procedure provided by Willard Manning. colinearity made it
impossible to obtain meaningful results from these altemative specifications.

12

Specification since they include six drunk driving laws.

An important advantage of these regression models over previous research is the
inclusion of variables representing a wide variety of alcohol control policies. This allows for
comparisons of the effectiveness of each policy. However, computation of elasticities is not

appropriate for policies which arc modeled with dichotomous variables or with several
variables. An alternative method of assessing the relative effects of the various alcohol

control policies is to simulate the number of lives that might have been saved by these
policies.

Simulations of alternative policies using the regression coefficients from the Limited

Specifications were performed by first predicting the actual number of fatalities in the 48
contiguous states of the U.S. from 1982 through 1988. The total number of fatalities is then

re-estimated changing the appropriate independent variable(s) to reflect the policy being
simulated and compared tn actual fatalities. Finally, for the drunk driving deterrence laws,

the number of fatalities averted as a result of existing laws is also estimated by re—estimating
toLal fatalities in the absence of the law being examined.

Tables 8 and 9 contain the results of these simulations for the three total and age-

specific fatality rates, respectively. The first value, in each cell, is the average annual
predicted reduction in fatalities due to the policy being simulated. The second represents

the percentage reduction in fatalities resulting from the simulated policy. For the drunk
driving laws, each cell contains two additional values: the number of fatalities averted by

existing laws and the percentage reduction in fatalities this represents (compared 10 the
estimated fatalities in the absence of the law under consideration). The estimated number

of fatalities which could be averted by the policy being simulated depends on both the
regression coefficients and the number of states that had the policy in effect from 1982
through 1988. This increases as

the absolute value of the coefficient increases and decreases

as the number of states with the policy increases. The full impact of each deLerrence
measure can be compared by summing the number of fatalities averted if all states had a

law with the number of fatalities averted by the laws already in effect.

B. Drunk Driving and Alcohol Related Policy Variables
The preliminary breath test law is negative and significant in all but one of the models
13

presented.e A comparison of fatality rates generally reveals the expected pattern of larger

coefficienls for the more alcohol involved fatality rates. There is generally no difference in
the osagoitude of the coefficients across the three alternative specifications or among 18 to
20 year olds. Clearly, states with a preliminary breath test law have significantly lower motor

vehicle accident fatality rates than states without this law. The simulations predict that if all

states had a preliminary breath test during the sample period, average annual fatalities

would have been reduced by approximately 3.4 percent, with about 20 percent of this
reduction taking place among 18 to 20 year olds. As expected, about 90 percent of the total

reduction would have occurred among alcohol involved drivers, Existing preliminary breath

test laws are estimated to have saved approximately 1,067 lives each year. Thus, the
marginal effect of going from no breath test laws to every state enacting a breath test law
is estimated to he 2,579 lives per year.

The indicator for laws limiting the use of plea bargaining in drunk driving cases is
negative and significant in 13 of the 18 models. A comparison of fatality rates reveals a
pattern of larger coefficients for the nighttime driver fatality rates than for the others, while
little difference is observed between the results for 18 to 20 year olds and the full sample.
Also, larger coefficients are observed in the Extended specification relative to the Single and

Limited specifleatioos. The empirical results provide evidence of a negative effect of a no

plea bargaining law on drunk driving fatality rates. Simulations indicate that a national no
plea bargaining law would have reduced night driver fatalities (where it was most significant)

by approximately 7.9 percent. About 16 percent of all fatalities averted by this law would

have been in the 18 to 20 year old group. An estimated 543 fewer night driver fatalities
were predicted when comparing the national no plea bargaining law simulation to that where

no state had a law.

The administrative per se law is significant in 12 of the models. Most of these
significant estimates are in the total fatality regressions including more than one law. There

is very little variation io the magoitude of the significant coefficients. Simulations imposing

a Alt statement concemtog signtticsnce are based on tests done at the ten-percent significance level,

a mandatory license sanction of one year (the most severe penalty in place in 1988) suggest

that administrative per se laws can significantly deter drunken driving as long as relatively

severe sanctions are imposed. Existing laws, with relatively weak penalties, are found to
have no deterrent effect. However, imposing a mandatory one year administrative sanction

in all states would have reduced total fatalities by 4,202., with about 19 percent of the
reduction occurring in the 18 to 20 year old group.

Mandatory minimum fines are found to be significant in 10 of the 18 alternative
specifications. All of the significant estimates occur in the models using the night driver or

alcohol involved driver fatality rate as the dependent variable. This is a reasonable result

since the effects of the deterrents are expected to be more obvious in the more alcohol
involved regressions. Also, a comparison of the 18 to 20 age group with the full sample

reveals somewhat smaller and less significant coefficients for youths. No systematic
difference in the magnitude of the coefficients is observed among the three alternative
specifications. These results suggest that mandatory fines do deter drunk driving although

the effect on young drivers may be weaker. Again, the simulations indicate that the
effectiveness of the mandatory fines appears to depend on relatively large fines being
imposed. Uniformly imposing a mandatory nominal fine of $500 would have reduced alcohol

involved driver fatalities by 2,738 per year, about 19 percent of these fatalities, with about
12 percent of the reduction taking place among 18 to 20 year olds. The marginal effect on
alcohol involved drivers of going from no states with a mandatory minimum fine to all states

imposing mandatory fines of $500 is estimated to be 2,916 lives.

The deterrent effect of a mandatory license action was found to be significant in 5

of the models presented. However, the signs of the coefficients on the two variables
capturing these penalties were consistent with a deterrent effect in all but one of the models
presented. Again, Ihe significant effects were observed only in the models using a dependent

variable representing greater alcohol involvement. The results were also significant in
specifications using all ages. These results indicate that the impact of a mandatory license

sanction is limited to older drivers. Simulating the impact of a national mandatory license
sanction of one year indicates that approximately 647 fewer alcohol involved driver fatalities
would have occurred in each year when compared to the situation where no states imposed
15

this type of mandatory penalty. As before, the estimated impact of the relatively weak
existing mandatory license sanctions indicates that these penalties must be fairly severe to
have any deterrence effeel
The dram shop law is negative and significant in all but one of the models presented.

As expected, a comparison of fatality rates generally reveals a pattern of larger coefficients

for the more alcohol involved fatality rates. Also, a comparison of the 18 to 20 age group
with the full sample reveals a clear pattern of smaller and less significant coefficients for
youths. This result is not surprising since, during the period examined, the minimum legal
drinking age was 21 in many states. Young people would, therefore, have difficulty receiving

service in the on-premise drinking establishments where the dram shop laws are expected
to have the greatest impact. Simulations indicate that the enactment of a dram shop law in
those states without one during the 1982 to 1988 period would have reduced total fatalities

by 852 per year. About 62 perceot of the fatalities averted by this policy would have been

in the alcohol involved driver group. A relatively low proportion of this reduction would
have occurred among 18 to 20 year olds. Comparing the national dram shop law case to the

situation where no state has a dram shop law iodieates that the marginal effect of this law
is 2,436 lives per year, a reduction in total fatalities of 5.3 percent.
The real beer tax coefficients are negative and significant at the one percent level in

all specifications reported. A comparison of fatality rates generally reveals a pattern of
larger coefficients for the more alcohol involved fatality rates. Also, a comparison of the 18

to 20 age group with the full sample reveals a clear patLern of larger coefficients for the

younger age group. Finally, a comparison of the Extended specification and Limited
specification reveals generally that the magnitude of the coefficients are larger in the
Exteaded specifications. These results suggest that beer taxes have a negative effect on

drunk driving and that this effect is larger for young driver than for nlder drivers.
Collinearity may be a problem in the Extended specification.

Three alternative increases in the beer tax are simulated. The first is an increase in

the nominal beer tax so that the real beer tax in effect in 1951 is maintained. This is an

increase in the heer tax from 16 cents to 71.6 cents per six-pack and represents a 447
percent increase in the federal beer tax in 1988. The simulations predict that this policy
16

would have reduced total fatalities per year, on average, by 5,174 or about 11.5 percent of

all fatalities. This policy would have reduced fatalities in the 18 to 20 year old group by
1,660 about 32 percent of all fatalities in this group.

The second tax simulation is an increase in the beer tax which equates the tax on the

pure alcohol in beer to the tax on the pure alcohol in distilled spirits. This is an increase
in the beer tax to 78.4 cents and represents a 490 percent increase in the federal beer tax
in 1988. The simulations predict that this policy would have reduced total fatalities per year
by 5,771, or approximately 12-8 percent of all fatalities. This policy would have reduced
fatalities in the 18 to 20 year old group by 1,822 which is about 35.2 percent of all fatalities

in this group.
The final tax policy simulated is the doubling of the tax to 32 cents per six-pack called

for in the deficit reduction package of 1990. The simulations predict that fliis policy would

have reduced total fatalities per year by 1,744 which is about 3.9 percent of all fatalities.

This policy would have reduced fatalities in the 18 to 20 year old group by 611 which is
about 11.8 percent of all fatalities in this group.
For each of the tax policies, a comparison of fatality rates shows that the magnitude

of the effect increases with the degree of alcohol involvement. About 75 percent of the

fatalities averted by these policies would be in the alcohol involved driver group. A
comparison of fatality rates for 18 to 20 year olds also shows that the magnitude of this
effect increases with the degree of alcohol involvement. About 32 percent of all fatalities
averted, of all ages, would have been in the 18 to 20 year old group.
The elasticity of the beer tax with respect to total fatalities was estimated for both the

18 to 20 year old group and for all ages- The younger group was expected to be more price

responsive than the overall population. The elasticity of the beer tax with respect to total
fatalities in the 18 to 20 year old age group is estimated to be -0.21, and for all ages to be 0.07.

These estimates are consistent with those obtained in nther recent studies. Saffer and

Grossman (1987a) estimated this elasticity for the 18 to 20 year old group to be —0.17.
Evans et. al. (1989) estimated this elasticity for all ages to be —0.11.

The results indicate that the effect of a minimum legal drinking age law is limited to

18 through 20 year olds. The drinking age is negative and significant in all models using

17

fatality rates for 18 to 20 year olds, while it attains significance in only the more alcohol
involved measures for the full sample. A comparison of the 18 through 20 year old fatality
races generally reveals a pattern of larger coefficients for the more alcohol involved fatality

rates. The effects of a 21 year old minimum legal purchase age in all states during the
sample period is simulated. The simulations predict that this policy would have reduced
fatalities in the 18 to 20 year old group by 166 per year. This is a small numher since most

states had a 21 year old minimom legal drinking age during the sample period. About 83

percent of the total fatalities averted would have been in the alcohol involved driver
category. To gain some further understanding of the overall impact of legal drinking ages,

the effects of an 18 year old minimum purchase age in all states is also simulated. The
simulations predict that this policy would have increased fatalities in the 18 to 20 year old

group hy 498 per year, with most of the increased fatalities in the alcohol involved driver
category. The marginal effect of going from an 18 to a 21 year old minimum legal purchase

age in all states is thus estimated at 664 lives.

The other DO! and alcohol related laws that were examined are the illegal per s;
implied consent, and npen container laws and the mandatory minimum jail sentences and
community service penalties. The Single Law specifications and the Extended specifications
produced mostly insignificant and positive coefficients or unstable coefficients for these laws.

The results suggest that these laws do not have a deterrence effect and, as a result, were
not included in the Limited specifications and no simulations were performed for them.
C. Alcohol Sentiment Measures

The variable measuring the percentage of the state population in dry counties is
negative and significant in only a few of the specifications presented. This may be due to

the fact that alcohol could he easily purchased in nearby counties. Thus, these results
suggest that local limits on the sale of alcoholic beverages have little impact on drunk
driving.

The Southern Baptist variable is never negative and significant, contrary to
expectations. The coefficients on the remaining religion variables are generally negative and

significant. A comparison of fatality rates with respect to alcohol involvement reveals no
particular pattern. Also, a comparison of the 18 to 20 age group with the full sample reveals
18

a general pattern of smaller coefficients for the younger age group. These results suggest
that religious participation ia associated with reduced alcohol abuse.
11 Uighway Conditions

The percentage of drivers eaceeding 5 miles per hour is positive and significant in
all specifications reported, as expected. Total vehicle miles driven per licensed driver was
expected to have a positive impact on fatality rates, since increased driving should increase

the prohahility of an accident. However, this variable was generally negative and
insignificant in the estimated equations. All motor vehicle fatality rates were found to be
positively and significaotly affected by the percentage of drivers ages 15 through 24 in all
estimated specitications. Mandatory safety inspections are expected to improve the quality

of motor vehicles aod, as a result, lower motor vehicle fatality rates. This variable is
negative and significant in all total fatality regressions, but is insignificant in all other
regressions. Mandatory seat belt use laws are expected to increase seat belt use, thereby
lowering the probahility of a fatality in a motor vehicle accident. This variable is negative

and significant in most of the equations estimated. With the exception of the inspection
indicator, a comparison of these results across fatality rates generally reveals a pattern of
larger coefficients for the more alcohol involved fatality rates. The only differences observed

hetween 18 to 20 year olds and the full sample are for the seat belt use laws which are
estimated to have a larger impact on youths.

a Economic Variables

Since both health and alcohol are normal goods, the effect of income on alcohol
demand is uncertain. However, real income is negative and significant in all specifications

reported. This suggests that the impact of income on health exceeds that of income on
alcohol consumption and drunken driving. A comparison of fatality rates generally reveals

a pattern of larger coefficients for the more alcohol involved fatality rates, while no
differences are observed by age. The unemployment rate is negative and significant in all

specifications reported, indicating that unemployed individuals do less driving and less
drinking away from home. A comparison of total fatality, nighttime fatality and alcohol
involved fatality rates for the full sample and for 18 to 20 year olds shows no particular
pattern for these variables with respect to either alcohol involvement or age.
19

V. cONCLUSiONS
Based on the regression and simulation results, the relative effectiveness of all major

drunk driving legislation, beer taxes and the minimum legal drinking age can he compared.

In several cases these comparisons depend on how severe a policy js assumed, since
sanctions can be set at relatively low or relatively high levels. The most severe mandatory

minimum sanction in effect in any state, in 1988, is used in the simulations. Simulations

using less severe penalties, which were not presented, implied that sanctions have to he
severe to he effective.
The most effective policies are the beer Lax and the relatively severe admioistrative

license action of one year. An increase in the beer tax to its real value in 195] would
decrease fatalities by 11.5 percent. A mandatory minimum administrative penalty of one
year decrease fatalities by about nine percent. However, the relatively weak administrative

penatties currently in place have little, if any, deterrent effect.

The next most effective policies are a 21 year old minimum legal drinking age, a
preliminary breath test law, a dram shop law, and the relatively high mandatory minimum
tine of $500. These policies each reduce total motor vehicle fatalities by about five to six

percent.! Finally, the no plea bargaining law and the mandatory minimum license action
of one year each reduce total fatalities by about one percent.'5
The other deterrent laws, which include mandatory jail sentences, community service

laws, and open container laws were not found to act as deterrents to drunk driving.

Art 18 year old drinking age is assumed as she altemative drinking age. The Ewe percent estimate is

based oo the number of 18 to 20 year old fatalities averted as a percent of total faralitiee. Also, the
alternative drunk driving policies are no law to be to effect in any ssate.

'

The estimate for the no plea bargaining law was computed using the number of ntghr driver fatalities

averted as a percent of soca! fatalities.
