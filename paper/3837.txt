EDUCATION AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN

ABSTRACT
The more education, the less unemployment of women; this

relationship is as strong as it is in the male labor force. The
channel through which this relation arises is also the same,
namely, labor turnover, almost half of which involves unemployment.

However, the relation between education and turnover is mediated
largely by educational differences in on-the-job training among
men, while educational difterences in labor force attachment are

the main source of turnover differences among women. This is
because levels of educational differences in on-the-job (in-house)

training are small among women, while nonparticipation in the labor
market and educational differences in it are quite small among men.
Educational differences in the duration of unemployment are
negligible among women, though they are observable, if small, among
men.

Recent growth in women's work attachment has reduced their
inter-labor force turnover and their unemployment rate to the point

of eliminating the sex differential. On-the-job training of women
appears to have increased, though it still remains skimpy.

EDUCATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN

Introduction
In a previous NCEE Report (1987). 1 analyzed the effects of education of male workers on
their unemployment experience. The Panel Study of Inome Dynamic (PSID) panel data covering
years from 1968 to 1982 confirmed the well-known finding of a negative relation between education
and

unemployment A major explanation of the education effect on unemptoyrnent was that the morn

educated workers change employers less frequently than other workers. In turn, their stronger
attachment to the firm is, in large measure. attributable to their more intensive learning and training on

the job. The positive correlation of education and training is a reflection of greater learning abilities,
opportunities. and preferences of Ut more educated persons. And the negative correlation between
training and turm,ver reflects Ut fact that to some extent skills acquired by training axe firm-specific,
that is, not fully transferable to other firms.
The major reason for analyzing men separately from women lies in sex differences in labor

force attachment (participation).' in contrast to men whose labor forte participation rate (LFPR) is9O
to 100 percent after completion of schooling, labor Ibrcc attachment of women still varies a great deal

over the life-cycle. And despite the rapid growth of their LFPR, It Is still not much more than 60
percent for married women in an average year. Again. It Is well known that women's attachment to

the labor market - whether measured by LFPR or by the fraction of the working life spent in the labor

market - is positively related to education. The stronger labor market attachment may be viewed as a
consequence of education, since the investment in education pays off mote in earnings the more time
the worker spends in the labor market Since inter-labor force twmDver (labor force exits and
reentries) is necessarily smaller among women whose labor market nwJwnent is stronger, the effects
of education on unemployment due to lesser turnover may be negative for women as they were for
men. but the causal channels axe clearly different, Men's turnover is almost entirely within the labor
market and is snnngly affected by on-the-job training. The fbllowing questions concerning women axe

'This conclusion was also reached in the pioneering work of the late Beth Niemi in the early 1970's.
Her analysis utilized aggregate and sectoral time series data. For references, see Niemi (1974 and 1975).
More recently. Janet Johnson (1983) reached a similar conclusion. Her argument is that unemployment
of women is overstated, as their on the job search is termed unemployment, when they are fully occupied

therefore of interest (1) How important is inter-labor force turnover, as distinguished (mm intra-labor
force turnover, in affecting unemployment? and (2) What Is the 'ole of training in the turnover and

unemployment of women?

In order to study women workn it was necessary to shift (mm Ut PSID, where information
on women Is less detailed, to the NLS (National Longitudinal Samples). This data set covers two
cohorts of women: (1) young women who were 14 to 24 years old in 1968, and (2) mature women

whowere3Uto44yearsoldthl967. Random sa

esof severaithousand women inthese two

cohorts were followed up intermittently over a period of sixteen years. This analysis uses information
(torn interviews conducted at one-year intervals in order to keep the frame of reference between

Interviews consistent.3 About half the interviews welt conducted at two-year Intervals. These were
excluded here In order to avoid non-comparabilities.' We restricted our data to women who art not

students and who worked in the labor market for some time during the years we observed. Only a
very small roportion of the women Qess than 5 percent) reported no work activity over the sixteenyear period,

Education and Labor Force Attachment
It is a well established finding of economic research that better-educated women tend to be
more strongly attached to the labor force than less-educated women. This behavior is explained by
human capital theory: The gain from investment in human capital (education and training) increases
as the payoff period is lengthened. Consequently, more educated women stay in the labor force over a
longer and more continuous working life and acquire more training than do less-educated women.

Their labor force turnover (especially between market and nonmarket) is smaller. Table I shows the
labor force participation rates (proportion of women who worked or searched for work in the survey

year) for younger and older women for four levels of education by age in the NLS. The table also
shows the proportion of working women who move in and out of the labor force during an avenge
year.

For younger women, the one-year surveys were in 1969 to 1973, 1978, and 1983. For older
women: 1968 to 1972, 1981, and 1982.

'Although all magnitudes are necessarily larger in two-year intervals, educational patterns of labor
force participation, of turnover rates, and of unemployment are quite similar. Compare Appendix Table

Despite the substantial growth in the women's labor force and some growth In continuity of

work, large proportions of women still work intermittently over their life-cycle and even within the
year. This internapted working does, of cowse. reflect the varying (across tUne and across women)
allocations of time and energy between the market and the household (family) for which most women

continue to bear major responsibilities.

This factor of time allocation or discontinuous labor force participation distinguishes the
analysis of women's behavior from that of men regarding training and labor mobility. We can view

the education and training decisions of men as positively dependent on their ability (hence expected
returns) and negatively on costs. In addition, the more educated men, who also gel more training.

change jobs less frequently, since firm-specific training is. likely to increase with the total volume of
Lraining, which Is substantial. For women, however, decisions about human capital investments

depend not only on ability and cost, but also on the prospective and actual allocation of time between

market and nonmarket activities. This proposition Is especially relevant to job training: School
education may be expected to confer benefits both to women workers and nonworters; job training

investments pay off only in the labor market.. Indeed, one may view the lifetime women's allocation
of marketJnonmarket activities more as an effect than a cause of educational decisions made early in

life. Their training, in the other hand, more closely depends cm actual and prospective work
attachment, though it is facilitated by educational background.

Given, on avenge, a shorter and interrupted working life, women are less likely than men to
invest in market-oriented betterment, both in teams of a lesser market focus of school education and in

lesser job training. As we also observe (below) women invest a much lesser fraction of their training

in firm-specific skills. There axe two reasons: (I) When work in the labor market is interrupted by
family demands, tic probability of returning to the same employer Is smaller than the probability of
returning to the labor market, even when the interruption is relatively short (2) Even when no
interruptions occur in labor market activities, some of women's job changes are Induced by family
demographic events, geographic and residential mobility, and other family exigenciet

As shown in Table I, inter-labor force turnover is inversely related to education, a result
mainly of stronger labor force attachment of the more educated. However, the relation between

6

taut-labor force turnover (job changing), especially quits, and educaUon is likely to be attenuated,

because of weaker finn-specificity of women's training, and because of household demanth.
Education and Training
Women engage in less training on the job than men do. Liliard and Tan (1986) found that

women who worked continuously over a 12-year period reported half as much company training as
comparable men did. And of those who worked intermittently, a much smaller proponion reported
in-house training. However, women tend to receive more training than men from sources outside the
place of work. such as business, technical, and vocational schools.

Table 2A shows the proportion of women workeis In each of the NLS cohorts who received
company training (In-house) and training outside of the work place. These axe reported over the

survey year (/ms for company training, irour for outside training), and since the start of employment

in the current firm (EJTIn. LiTous). It is clear that women worten tend to take most of their training
from outside souxces. Such training serves occupational pwposes that are not usually specialized to a

particular ft".n. In-house training which is more likely to be (inn-specific is received by few women,
especially in the older cohort Table 2A also shows that the incidence of both kinds of training
increases with education. This positive correlation of training with education reflects the greater
learning ability as well as the greater commitment to the labor market of the more educated women
workers. The positive relation between education and training, which may also reflect
complementatity between the two learning activities. appears to be stronger among men and in the
younger women's cohort,

Table 2A represents gross (unadjusted) differences in training among women with different
levels of education. In Table 23 these differences are standardized for venous characteristics of
women workers, In addition to education, so that the coefficients shown in Table 2B represent "net
effectS' of education. They measure the increase or decrease In the frequency of training observed in
otherwise similar women whose education is increased by one year. Although both the adjusted (2B)
and unadjusted (2A) data show positive correlations of training with education, the adjusted estimate

of this relation in the form of regression coefficients shown in 2B indicates some interesting
differences: For the young women, the ire: effects qf education on in-house training axe positive arid
are monger the longer the period over which such training is observed. In contrast, in-house training

Is not significantly related to education of the older cohort. However, outside training increases with
education (stasling at the 910 II year school level) In both cohorts. Other characteflstics included in

the regression but not shown in Table 28 are: marital status, health, number of' children,
unemployment rates, size of labor market, potential experience (years since completion of schooling),

service Indusay employment, and union membership. The flaIl regression is shown in the Appendix

Table Al.
In die full regression, it appears that the incidence of in-house training is smaller among
married women, black women, and women who have more children, and is greater in larger labor

markets and in service industries. Training frequency increases In the first decade after completion of
schooling and declines thereafter, is smaller the longer women stay out of the labor market, and larger
the longer their unintermpted employment (not shown here). All these effects do not appear to be

significant fur the older cohort, partly because much less training is received by them and partly
because

the sample Is smaller,
As for outside training, it

is similarly less frequent among wanted women and black women.

and it declines with age in the younger cohort. However, It Is greater among employecs in service

industries and in periods of high unemployment when trainee opportunity costs are low.

Of special interest are the differences between the two cohorts: The decline in training as
workers age is a predictable finding according to human caÃ±tal theory because aging implies a
shortening of the payoff period, making invesimems in training less profitable. The decline is clearly

observed among men in a number of studies. The age pattern for women Is less predictable in view
of the interruptions winch am more frequent and longer during the first one or two decades after
leaving schooL The lesser training received by the older cohort of women, compared to the younger

cohort, as seen in Table 2A, reflects more than an age effect Table 2C shows the incidence of
training fur each cohort at the same age (30 to 39). Rather clearly, the youngercohort acquired more
training (especially In-house) than the older one, at the same age. That age was reached bythe
younger cohort almost a decade after it was reached by the older cohort Increasing labor force
attachment of women over this period, especially in the younger cohort, has been documented in a

9

number of studies.4 It is also visible in Table I in the columns showing the turnover rates. The
stmnger work commitment in the recent cohorts increases training incentives of workers and
employers. This is especially true of in-house training which is more likely to be firm specific. Table

2C clearly confirms this hypothesis, though the incidence of women's on-the-job training still remains
quite small among young women compared to young men.
We proceed now to women's turnover, measured by separation rates, distinguishing between
intra- and Inter-labor force turnover.

Separations
Table 3A classifies separation rates P(s) Into intra-labor force movements between firms while

in the labor market P(Sa) anti interâ€¢labor force P(Se) moves in and out of the labor force. In the latter,

entry is preceded and exit is followed by nonparticipation. Both intra- and inter-labor force moves arc

expressed as ratios to the labor force during the survey year. Multiple moves within the year are
counted as one, since they ait not reported.

Of course, P(s) = P(Sa) + P(Se).

It is clear in these figures (column a) that education reduces turnover ?(s) mainly because it

reduces inter-labor force mobility P(Se). Within the labor mirket education has a weak or no apparent
effect on labor mobility. (ntis stands in sharp contrast to the negative effect observed among men.)
Inter-labor force mobility P(Se) is more frequent than job changing within the market P(Sa) at
education levels of high school and below, and becomes somewhat less frequent than job mobility at

higher levels especially for the young women. The table also shows tha. younger women move more
frequently than older women within thc market and between market and household.

This finding is reversed in inter-labor force turnover, and the differences in intra-labor force
turnover disappear, when the two cohorts art observed at the same age (column b in Table 3A).

Trends in labor force attachment are clearly responsible for these findings. The growth in job training
in the younger cohort is consistent with these developments, However, the absence of a trend in
intra-labor force turnover suggests that growth in women's job training is mainly a result rather than a

The major findings in 3D confirm those in 3A: Total separation rates decline quite strongly as
education level rises in both cohorts of women. It Is clear1 however, looking at Table 3C, that this
decline Is due to the decline of inter-labor force mobility P(Se) which reflects the increase In labor

forte attachment Inn-a-labor force mobility (job change) NSa) appears to be unaffected by education.
In-house training received during the previous year or any time during firm tenure reduces

separations (Fable 38). Training received elsewhere Is also negatively related to turnover, but the

effect is much smaller. Once again, when separations are distinguished between intra- and inter-labor
force moves, it appears that it is the labor forte entries and exits that are most stmngly affected by
training especially by In-house training (Table 3C).

In-house training also reduces intra-labor lotte moves somewhat, but outside training which is
weakly relaxed to moves has no effect on intra-labor force job changes. These findings are consistent

with the view that outside training is basically general (transkrable to other firms) hence has no effect
on firm separations as such. Its weak effect on labor force znobilfty reflects rather than determines a
greater attachment to the labor force, and especially of moze educated women.

Do the finellnr on the effects of two kinds of training on two classes of Wmover In Table 3,
shed any light on the relation between education and turnover? This relation appears to hold only in
inter-labor force moves. The effects of education on labor force attachment art sufficient to explain
this finding.
The positive relation between education and training enhances the negative relation between

education and Inter-labor forte mobility, but greater training received by the more educated women

appears to be a consequence zither than a cause of lesser mobility. This Is especially true of the larger
part of training, namely of outside training which is not likely to contain any finn specificity. While
in-house training does reduce mobility, it is not at all related to education of the older women. It is
positively correlated with education of younger women (as shown in Table ZB) yet the effect on the
relation between education and job change (within the market) is barely visible (Fable 3B).
One reason why a positive correlation between education and In-house training does not translate into
a negative relation between education and job turnover Is that the amount of in-house training of

women Is relatively nall. Mother reason is shown In Table 4, which distinguishes quits from layoffs
15

in job separations, and shows the effects of education on each. It Is clear that education has Little, if
any, effect on quits, despite the somewhat greater in-louse training of the younger educated women.3

Apparently quits of women workers ate strongly motivated by family demands including the need for
flexible time schedules, residential changes, and husbands job mobility (Mincer, 1978). Layoffs.
whose timing is riot subject to these considerations, are affected by education, reflecting employer

demand (or human capital and some employer invesnnent in training of women whose work
commitment is stronger.

However, the bulk of job mobility of women is due to quits, as shown in Table 4. The ratio
of quits to layoffs among women, especially younger women, is over 2 to I among older women and
higher among younger women, while it is closer to equality among men (Mincer, 1987). The high

ratio of quits to layoffs reflects not only the importance of family demands on women's allocation of
tune, but also their greater representation in industries (such as service Industries) in which layoffs alt

less frequent

We may conclude that human capital acquired by women at school and while at work affects
their turnover largely because it affects their inter-labor forte turnover and to a lesser extent because it
reduces the risk of layoffs.

The asymmetric effect of education on quits and layoffs is also of some importance in
understandIng the relation between education and the Incidence of unemployment

Education and Unemployment
Table SA shows the (unadjusted) incidence of unemployment P(u) in an avenge survey year,

unemployment declines with education as sharply as it does among men (MIncer, 1987, Table I). The

Although inn, separations P(Sa) alt unrelated to education, the probability of experiencing
unemployment conditional on a job change P(u/Sa) declines quite steeply. This Is because layoffs
decline while quits do not as was indicated in the previous section. Tn the inter-labor force context

both separations and conditional unemployment decline, the latter also a result of quit/layoff behavior.
Consequently, the decline in unemployment incidence by education is about twice as steep in the

inter-labor force context than in intra-, in both cohorts of women.
The net relation of unemployment incidence to education is shown in the left panel of Table

5B. (Full regression in Appendix Table A3). On avenge, incidence declines about 3 percent per year
of education of young women, and about 2 percent for older women. Table 5B also shows that
in-firm training reduces the incidence of unemployment as well. As already stated, this is because
training reduces layoffs as well as labor force exits. Outside training is not a sigilflcant factor in

unemployment incidence.

Finally, to understand the relation between education and unemployment rates we must take

into account durations of unemployment spells. As was shown in the report dealing with the male
labor force, the unemployment rate (u) is basically a product of the incidence of unemployment and of
Its duration, d(u).

The additional factor d(l Is the fraction of year spent in the labor fOrce. This factor d(l) is

close to unity for men, and its variation by education can be ignored. It Is more important In

analy7ing women's unemployment as it reflects differences in labor force participation. The rationale

for the term l/d(l) is that with the same incidence (given duration) of unemployment, persons who
spend fewer weeks

in the labor force during die year have a higher unemployment rate per week in the

labor forte.

Table 6 shows the patterns of duration of unemployment by education. Panel A,

unstandardized, shows a very small decline as education rises for younger women, and practically no
change for older women. The regression adjusted pastern In Panel B shows, If anything, small
increases

of duration. Not surprisingly, job training has no effect on women's unemployment duration.

Why is duration of unemployment not shorter for the more educated women, as Is true of

men? The answer Ues In the differences In labor force attachment Labor force withdrawal which is
more common among less educated women cuts their duration of unemployment to a greater extent

than it does for the more educated women. The rough constancy of duration by education of women

still yields a dedilning d(u)/d(l) of about the same magnitude as for men: For men d(l) was

roughly

constant, but d(u) declined 1$ to 20 percent from lowest to highest education leveL For women a
similar decline in the ratio d(u)/d(l) is due to the increase in d(l) while d(u) is almost constant.

Changes In d(l) and in the d(u)/d(l) ratio relaxed to education are shown hi Table 6, panel C.
Men and women equally lessen risks of unemployment, with morn education. This is Live of
the Incidence of unemployment and of unemployment rates, despite the fact that women's in-housejob
training is small and largely unrelated to their turnover, especially to quit behavior. The major
channel for the educational differences in the unemployment of women is the effect of education on

labor forte attachment. As both education (at college and higher levels) and labor force rates have
accelerated In the recent decade, women's unemployment razes, which previously exceeded men's

rates, have fallen relative to the unemployment of men. Vanishing of the sex differential is observable

in the 1980's.' Indeed, a reversal in the sex differential in unemployment is likely. if labor force
attachment of women continues to grow, and if their industrial distribution remains largely unchanged.

'HIS data 'in Employment and Earnings show that about 40 percent of unemployment of women is
due to entries and reenuies into the labor force. When this component is eliminated (or equalized).
women's unemployment was no greater than men's before the 1980's, and smaller in the 1980's.
Including the labor force component, total unemployment was higher for women than for men before and
about equal during the 1980's.
