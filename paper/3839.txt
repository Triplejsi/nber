TAX EXPORTING, FEDERAL DEDUCTIBILITY.
AND STATE TAX STRUCTURE

ABSTRACT
This paper studies the interaction between the federal and
state tax systems during the 1980s and in particular considers
how the Tax Reform Act of 1986 affected state tax structure.
Using a panel data set on state governments over a nine year
period, I estimate tax share equations for six categories of
taxes.
I find that the state personal income tax is sensitive to

changes in its tax price but find

a

much smaller sensitivity to

changes in tax prices for the general sales tax.

I then consider

various reasons for why the sales tax does not exhibit a
sensitivity to changes in tax price and consider the implications
of these results for policy makers.

In the presence of this feedback, ordinary

estimates of tax price coefficients in tax share regressions

will be biased.

I will use an instrumental variable approach to control for

this simultaneity. These examples also highlight the advantages of using the
NBER TAXSIM tax calculator to compute individual tax prices.

TAXSIM is a set

of Fortran routines

which uses detailed data from the

the federal tax liability for individual tax returns.

tax liability on an individual's tax return resulting from an

additional dollar of income.

For the purposes of this study, I impute to each

return an additional dollar of state tax deductions (for any given tax) and
measure the reduction

in federal and state tax liability. The tax price
(P1)

equals one minus the reduction in tax liability.

A possible reason for

that businesses pay a considerable amount of sales

follows from the fact

Stephen Pollock (1991) has noted that businesses contribute as much

as 45% to sales tax collections.

One possible response to an increase in the

sales tax price is for states to broaden the base so as to tax more purchases
made by businesses.

While some of those

taxes will ultimately be paid by

residents, either through higher prices or lower factor prices,

much of these

VI. Conclusion
Policy makers at the federal level might point to the continuing strong
reliance by states on the sales

tax and argue that eliminating federal

deductibility for state and local taxes will have no consequences for the
state and local sector.

Results froa this analysis

Conceptually, there is no reason to treat the two types of exporting
differently. It ia useful to do so though to emphasize the influence of
federal tax policy on atate and local tax policies.

An additional benafit of using TAXSIM is tha ability to construct
instrumental variables to control for the endogeneity in the tax price
variable noted above.
Higher levels of state taxation increase the
probability of itemtzing which in turn reduces the tax price for that
particular tax. This leads to a negative correlation between rhe residual in
a tax regression and the tax price variable.
Second, higher levels of a
particular tax taken as a deduction may push the taxpayer into a lower tax
bracket which increases the tax price and leads to a positive correlation
between tax share residuals and the measured tax price.
I construct three
instruments for the tax price using TAXSIM. A "first dollar" tax price can be
constructed by zeroing out the deductions reported by taxpayers and computing
a marginal tax rate on wage income.
Call this r.
I
then impute a
probability of itemizing to each taxpayer based on national itemization rates
conditional on the returns adjusted gross income and number of dependents.
Call this p. Then the first dollar measure of tax price would equal

Instead of
zeroing out tax deductions, I replace the reported deductions with the average
amount reported nationally by a taxpayer of the conditioning variables and
Call this r. The last dollar

tax price then is
— 1 p5r5.
The third instrument is p. Note that I need at least two tax prices, one for
the income tax price and the other for the sales tax price. The advantage of
these instruments is that they control for both forms of endogeneity and can
be constructed mt the micro level (i.e. for each tax payer)and aggregated to a
statewide level.
14

Alaska and Hawaii are eliminated from the study to be consistent with
previous research in this area. Hawaii has a unique state-local relationship
which may make it more similar to large cities than to other states.
15

The correlation is 0.69 over the sample period during which the general
sales tax is fully deductible.
16
The retail sales measure also includes sales to industrial, retail, and
other business firas so long as the sale is a final sale.
Therefore, a
high sales activity index may also reflect exporting to non-residents through
business sales taxes which may in large part be exported.
17
Previous research by Holtz-Eakin and Rosen (1988) as well as research on
municipal debt supply by Metcalf (1991) suggest the importance of correlated
individual effects in models of state or local revenue structure. State sales
tax rates change slowly over time and removing the across state variation
through the use of firsr difference or fixed effects estimation removes most
of the information in the data. Adding dummies for Census region in those
