HOW COMPUTERS HAVE CHANGED THE
EVIDENCE FROM MICRODATA,

WAGE

STRUCTURE:

1984-89

ABSTRACT

This paper examines whether employees who use a computer at
work earn a higher wage rate than otherwise similar workers who
do not use a computer at work.

The analysis primarily relies on

data from the Current Population Survey and the High School and
Beyond Survey.
try

to correct

A

variety of statistical models are estimated to

for unobserved variables that might be correlated

with both job-related computer use and earnings.

The estimates

suggest that workers who use computers on their job earn roughly
a 10 to 15 percent higher wage rate.
In addition, the estimates
suggest that the expansion in computer use in the l980s can
account for between one-third and one-half of the observed
increase in the rate of return to education,

Finally,

occupations that experienced greater growth in computer use
between 1984 and 1989 also experienced above average wage growth.

Several researchers have documented that

significant changes

in the

structure of wages took place in the United States in the 1980$.l

For

example, the rate of return to education increased markedly since 1979,

graduates increasing from 38 percent in 1979 to 55 percent in 1989.

In

addition, wage differentials based on race have expanded while the malefemale wage gap has narrowed,

and the reward for experience appears to have

increased. These changes in the wage structure do not appear to be a
result of transitory cyclical factors.

In contrast

to the near consensus

of opinion regarding the scope and

direction of changes in the wage structure in the 1980s,

the root causes of

these changes are more controversial, The two leading hypotheses that have
emerged to explain the rapid changes in the wage structure in the 1980s
are: (1) increased international competition in several industries has hurt
the economic position of low-skilled and less-educated workers in the U.S.
(e.g., Murphy and Welch, 1991);
change

(2) rapid,

skill-biased technological

in the 198Dm caused profound changes in the relative productivity of

various types of workers (e.g., 8ound and Johnson,
Allen,

1991).

Unfortunately, the evidence that has been used to test these

hypotheses has been mainly indirect, relying primarily on aggregate
industry-levelor time-series data.
This paper explores the impact of the 'computer revolution" on the
wage structure using three microdata sets.

The 1980s witnessed

unprecedented growth in the amount and type of computer resources used at

Several authors who have come to view technological

change as a promising explanation of changes in the wage structure have
highlighted the computer revolution as the prototypical example of such
rechno1ogcal change,2
It is important to stress that the effect of technological change on
the relative earnings of samious categories of workers is theoretically
ambiguous.

The new computerzechnology may be a cozsplemeneâ‚¬or e substitute

with skilled workers.3

In the former case, the computer revolution

is

likely to lead to an expansion in earnings differentials based on skill,
and in the latter case it is likely to lead to compression in skill-based
differentials. This caper focuses on the narrow issue of whether employees
who use computers at wprk earn more as a result of applying their computer
skills,

and whether the premium for using

s

computer can account for much

of the changes in the wage structure, The analysis pris4arily uses data
from Current Pcpulstion Surveys (CPS) conducted in October of 1984 and
1989.

These surveys contain supplemental questions on computer use.

Since

2For example, Bound end Johnson (1990) write that one explanation
"attributes wage structure changes to changes in technology, brought on in
large part by the computer revolution." They conclude that this
explanation "receives a great deal of support from the data."

Although the analysis is by necessity nonexperimenral, I tentatively

These models still show a sizable pay

differential for using a computer at work.

In 1989,

for example,

employees

who use computers on the job earn 17.6 percent higher pay than employees
who do nor use computers on the job, holding education, occupation, and
other cherecterstics constant.

If 44 two-digit occupmtion dummies are

included in the model in column (6) instead of one-digit occupation
dummies,

a.

Employer characteristics
Although

I

em mainly concerned about bias because of omitted employee

characteristics that etc correlated with computer use at work,
possible that characteristics of employers

it is

are correlated with the

provision of computers and the generosity of compensation. Such a

relationship might exist in a rent-sharing model

in which employees are

able to capture some of the retutn to the employer's capital stock.
Unfortunately there is only a limited amount of informatiun about employer
characteristics in the CFS.

However,

included in a model that includes

if 48 two-digit industry dummies are

two-digit occupation dummies and the

covatiates in column (6), the compoter use wage diffetential is 11.4
percent,

with a t-ratio of l3.O.

Information on employer size is not available in the October CPS, but
two findings soggest that the computer differential is not merely
reflecting the effect of (omitted) employer size.

First, establishment-

level surveys do not show a strong relationship between computer use and
establishment size (e.g., Hitschorn, 1991).

Second,

in a recent paper

Reilly (1990) uses a sample of 607 employees who worked in 60
establishments in Canada in 1979 to investigate the relationship between
establishment size and wages.

Reilly estimates wage regressions including

a dwmsy variable indicating access to a computer. Without controlling for
establishment size, ha finds that employees who have access to a computer
earn 15.5 percent (tâ€”S.7) higher pay.

When he includes the log of

establishment size the computer-wage differential is 13.4 percent (tâ€”3.9).
Finally,

I

have estimated the model in column (5) separately for union

and nonunion workers.

The premium for computer use is 20.4 percent

(t-rarioâ€”23) in the nonunion sector, and just 7.8 percent (tâ€”4.3) in the
union sector.

Since unions have been found to compress skill differentials

(see Lewis, 1986 and Card, 1991), this finding should not be surprising.
5Results for 1984 are similar: the wage differential falls to 11.3
percent if 44 occupation dummies are included, and to 9.0 percent if 48
two-digit industry dummies are included.

However,

if one believed that the premium for work-related Computer use is

a result of employees oapturing firms' oaptal rents rather than a return
to a skill,

it is diifioult to explain why the premium is so muoh larger in

the nonunion seotor than in the union seotor.

However, the slight increase in

behind the positive association between computer use and wages.
The other variables in Table

Further,

the finding that the computer-wage differential is

attenuated when covariates are included in the OLS regressions suggests
that important variables may be omitted that are positively correlated with
both computer use and earnings.

I have tried four empirical strategies to

probe whether the computer-pay differential is a real consequence of
coaputer use or is spurious.

The large premium secretaries appear to receive for using a

accords with two additional pieces of evidence on the value
employers place

on computer

skills.

First,

I

conducted a small phone survey of temporary

employment agencies in New York City

San Francisco, Cleveland, and Dallas,

and asked several questions concerning the computer use and
pay of the
secretaries they place.

141 temporary

agencies were contacted, and

at

least partial responses were received from 83 (58.9 percent) agencies.7
Interestingly, 84 percent of surveyed firms currently give job applicants a
written or hands-on test of computer skills.

One of the questions we asked

the placement firms was:

are employers willing to pay

"In your experience,

secretaries more if they have computer skills than if they don't have
computer skills?"

Ninety-eight percent of agencies responded yes.

We also asked the placement firms: "What is the typical
hourly pay
rate a secretary is paid who does not have computer skills?",

and "What is

the typical hourly pay rate a secretary is paid who is otherwise identical

but does have computer skills?" The mean hourly rate for a secretary with
computer skills was $12.77 (std. error â€”$0.43), and the mean hourly rate
for a secretary without computer skills was $9.14 (std. error â€”

$0.25).

The difference in the mean log wage for computer vs. noncomputer use in
this sample is .33 (std.

error â€”

02),

which is much greater than the

estimated log-wage differential for computer use derIved for secretaries
7Employment agencies in the survey were selected from the yellow pages
of the phone books for these four cities. The survey was conducted in
August 1991, and the questions were addressed to "someone who is
knowledgeable about placement." More information on the sample frame and
questionnaire is available on request.

Lastly,

And in 96 percent of the instances

the employment agency pays for the training.

In the remaining 4 percent the employee pays for training;

none of the

firms responded that the firm where the worker is placed pays for training.
The finding that employment agencies pay for computer training for
temporary employees is quite surprising because the training is likely to
be of general use.

Moreover, this phenomenon differs from on-the-job

training since temporary workers cannot pay for training by taking a lower
initial wage because they receive

the training before they start work, and

they are under no obligation to subsequently work.

The fact that temporary

agencies seem to find it profitable to provide computer training to the
workers they place suggests
Second,

there

is a substantial return to computer skills.

a survey of 507 secretaries employed by large firms conducted

by Kelly Services

(1984, p. 13) provides some additional evidence

on

whether employers truly pay a wage premium to secretaties with computer
skills. This survey found that 30 percent of secretaries received a pay
raise as a result of obtaining word processing skills.
Although the estimated wage premium for secretaries who use computers
at work based on CPS data may appear to be large by economic standards

that the CI'S may

underestimate the premium for computer use.

From a practical perspective,

the large wage differential for secretaries who are ptoficent at operating
computers suggests that public-sector training programs might profitably
concentrate on providing trainees with computer skills.
I have estimated the computer wage differential for six additional
8
white collar occupations.

To summarize these results

the estimated

computer differential (a) and standard error for these occupations in 1989
are:

.137 (.035) for managers;

(.038) for school teachers;

.101 (.044) for registered nurses; .060

.185 (.046) for sales

supervisors;

for sales representatives; and .089 (.062) for book keepers.

.052

(.073)

Further

analysis indicates that the computer premium mends to be smaller in thteedigit occupations that have a greater proportion of wctkers using
computers.

Thus far, we have treated the 085 data sets as independent cross-

sections.

We can also take advantage of the repeated nature of the 085

data sets by linking cohorts over time.

This paper presenrs a derailed investigation of whether employees who

A variety of

estimates

use a computer at work earn a 10 to 15 percent higher wage rare.

in

Although

it is unlikely thet a single explanation ran adequately account for all the
wage structure changes that occurred in the 1980a, these results provide
support for the view that technological change -- and in particular the
spread of computers at work

-

- has

significantly contributed to recent

changes in the wage structure.
One frequent objection to the conclusion that the computer revolution
is

an important cause of recent

changes

in the wage structure is made by

Blmckburn, Bloom, and Freeman (1991): "U.s. productivity during the 1990s
showed only sluggish growth, not the rapid advance one might expect if
technological change were the chief cause of the changing structure of
wages.

Although there may be some merit to this view, there are two

reasons to question its importance.

First, Griliohes and Seigel

(1991)

find a positive relationship between total factor productivity growth and
the prevalence of computers among industries.
Second,

technological change may cause changes in the dstributon of

earnings without a dramatic effect on aggregate productivity growth or
aggregate wage growth.

For example,

suppose the advent of computers has

And suppose that

Furthermore, since the growth in computers wss gradual over a perrud of at

School and Seyond Survey Sample

The High School and Seyond Survey consists

of a base-year survey

conducted in 1960, and follow-up waves conducted in 1982, 1984 and 1986,
The sample used here consists of individuals who were sophomores or seniors

in 1980 and who graduated from high

school

by

1986, but did nor receive any

additional education. The sample is further restricted to individuals who
responded to all waves of the survey. were employed in 1984, earned between

detailed description of the HSBS, including the sample design,
questionnaire, and tabulations of variables, see Sebring,

et al. (1987).

The variable "used computer at work" is derived from the 1984 survey
wave.

If the worker reports ever having used a computer at work, he or she

is assigned a one for the computer use dummy variable.

Computer use may

involve using a microcomputer, minicomputer, or mainframe computer.

The

variable defined as "used computer at home" equals one if the worker used a
computer terminal microcomputer, minicomputer, or mainframe computer for
"recreational" purposes (i.e., nonwork and nonschool related use).
The hourly wags rate pertains to the worker's current job as of l98,
and is derived from the reported pay schedule and reported weekly hours,
The variable called "Senior in 1980" equals one for individuals who

high school seniors in 1980, and zero for individuals who were sophomores

The variable called "union member" indicates whether the worker

was a member or active participant in a union, farm, trade or professional
association in 1985 or 1986.
