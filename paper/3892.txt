MONETARY POLICY, BUSINESS CYCLES

ABSTRACT

present evidence

on

the cyclical behavior of small versus

manufacturing firms, and on the response of the two classes

of firms to monetary policy.

Our goal is to take a step toward

the role of credit market imperfections in the

business cycle

and in the monetary transmission mechanism.

We

find that, following tight money, small firms sales decline at a
faster pace than large firm sales for a period of more than two
years.

Further, bank lending to small firms contracts, while it

actually rises for large firms.

Monetary policy indicators tied

to the performance of banking, such as M2, have relatively
greater predictive power for small firms than for large.
Finally, small firms are more sensitive than are large to lagged
movements in GNP.

Considering that small firms overall are a

non-trivial component of the economy, we interpret these results
as suggestive of the macroeconomic relevance of credit market
imperfections.

Introduction
This paper presents evidence on the cyclical behavior of small versus

large manufacturing firms,

and on the

differential response of the two kinds

of firms to various indicators of monetary

policy.

Our objective is

to

provide some empirical insight into the role of credit market imperfections
in the monetary transmission mechanism and in the business cycle, more
broadly. Subject to the usual caveats of interpreting time series results,
our principal findings are that small firms react more sharply and typically
quicker both to movements in GNP and to movements in conventional
indicators of monetary policy.

As

we will argue, our empirical findings, in

conjunction with the fact that small firms are
GNP,

are suggestive of the

a non-trivial component of

macroeconomic relevance

of credit market

frictions.
There

is a large body of

evidence consistent with

the idea that

monetary policy has been an important factor in postwar business
fluctuations (e.g., Sims (1980), Eckstein and Sinai (1986), Romer and Romer
(1989), Bernanke and Blinder (1990)).

There remains, however, considerable

debate over the exact nature of the monetary transmission mechanism. One
element of this debate is whether credit market imperfections may enhance

the potency of monetary policy (e.g., Blinder and Stiglitz

(1983), Romer and

Rorner (1990), Bernanke and Blinder (1990), Kashyap, Wilcox and Stein
(1991)).

Efforts to resolve this issue have concentrated

on analyzing

the

response of various money and credit aggregates to shifts in monetary
policy.

Though this approach has been informative, one limitation is that

the competing theories are often capable of generating similar predictions
about the movement of money and credit. This observational equivalence

problem arises because

it is typically difficult to distinguish between

demand versus supply-induced movements of each financial aggregate.' We try

to shed light on the issue

in

an alternative way,

by comparing the cyclical

behavior of small versus large firms. Our approach exploits the idea

that

small firms are more likely to confront credit market frictions.2
Section 2 presents a simple model designed to illustrate how credit
market imperfections may introduce a kind of risk aversion on the part of
firms, making their behavior 'excessively sensitive' to earnings flows and

to interest rates.3 The

thus suggests, everything else equal, that small firms should

be more

sensitive than large firms to macroeconomic conditions. Macroeconomic
conditions include both the state of the business cycle and the stance of
monetary policy, under the interpretation that changes in the short term

interest rate encapsulate shifts in monetary

policy.

It is worth adding

that our story is complementary but not isomorphic to the "credit

view' of

'There have been some creative approaches to solving the identification
problem. Kaahyap, Wilcox and Stein (1991), for example, try to identify
shifts in credit supply by examining the behavior of the division of short
term credit between bank loans and commercial paper, and then demonstrating
the relationship of this "mix" variable to real activity.
2Differential effects on small versus large firms has been an important theme
of the empirical literature on credit market imperfections and investment.
See, for example, Fazzari, Hubbard and Peterson (1928) and Evans and Jovanovic
(1989). The macroeconomic consequences are discussed in Gertler and Hubbard
(1989).

3This kind of excess sensitivity result is a key feature of the literature
on the macroeconomic consequences of credit market imperfections. See, for
example, Farmer (1985), Williamson (1987), Greenwald and Stiglitz (1988),
Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and Gertler (forthcoming).

and Blinder (1988); this is because our theory relies on magnification

effects owing to credit market imperfections rather than

on the ability

of

monetary policy to directly regulate bank lending.4
We

check the general implications of our model by analyzing the time

series behavior of small versus large firms.

Section 3 describes the data

set we use. It consists of a time series of sales by manufacturing firms,
divided up by size class. We present some summary Statistics to indicate

differential response of small firms is particularly striking when the

are used. Relatedly, we find that in the wake of tight

money,

because reserve requirements on CDs are low (now they no longer exist),
monetary policy cannot effectively regulate the flow of bank lending. (The

argument presumes that banks are able to elastically issue CD5, which is
open to debate.) Whether our theory is right, however, is not tied to the
question of whether open market operations directly control bank credit.

to small firms contracts, while it rises for large firms.

Additionally, small firms are more sensitive to lagged movements in GNP,
which is Consistent with our theory.
We also explore

the partial correlations of small and large firms with

the various monetary policy indicators. Several results here deserve
highlighting: Small firms are more Closely related than large firms to

M2

and to the ratio of bank loans to commercial paper (the 'mix' variable
constructed by Kashyap, Stein and Wilcox (1991) to capture the tightness of
monetary policy); Conversely, the commercial paper/ T-bill risk-spread is a

8The key assumption is that the expected average product is higher for large
firms than for small firms (which makes the debt of the large firm safer).
Having any kind of fixed cost will suffice. To minimize algebra, it is
simplest to embed the scale economies in the bankruptcy costs, which in
itself does not seem unreasonable.
Two alternative ways to obtain our predictions would be to assume that
small firms face proportionately more idiosyncratic risk or to assume they
have proportionately less collateral than large firms. Either assumption
would generate a proportionately larger premium for external funds for small
firms.

Second, risk averse behavior by

intermediaries is possible, which would

impact largely on small firms. If an intermediary is unable to perfectly

diversify, then its capital position may constrain the quantity of loans it
supplies [see Bernanke and Gertler, (1987)1. This

The bank's capital position matters ultimately to

Fluctuations in bank capital therefore affect loan terms. The

so-called "credit—crunch" of the current recession essentially works through
this mechanism. The impact is greater on small firms since they are unable to
substitute to the open market to obtain credit (since the monitoring and
evaluation costs required to obtain "arms—length" credit are

disproportionatelylarge for these kinds of firms. )16

argument why bank capital influences bank lending. Diamond (1984) shows, as

this case is systemic, and is therefore observable.

such data with any significant time series dimension is the Quarterly

$25 to $50 million, $50 to $100 million, $100 to $250 million, $250 to $1000

any given size category, we look at different sub—periods in the data,
computing 40 quarter standard deviations for each sub—period. To assess the
sensitivity of this relative volatility measure to changes in the cutoff used

to classify firms into small and large categories, we vary the cutoff

used to divide the firms, starting with the lowest QFR cutoff and steadily
increasing it. These results are reported in table 2.

'1t is also noteworthy that the QFR keeps a firm in a size class for eight
quarters before making any adjustment. This dampens considerably the number
of firms which shift categories in the wake of a macro shock.

We

consider the two other indicators, the spread and mix variables,

measures.

Both Romer and Romer (1989) and Bernanke (1990) present evidence

suggesting that the spread is driven by monetary policy and.

a good indicator of monetary tightness.

Intuitively, tight money leads to relatively greater issuance of commercial
paper and CDs (which are close substitutes for commercial paper), which
historically placed upward pressure on the commercial paper rate relative to
the T-bill rate. The attention the spread has received as a leading

19

indicator also makes it a desirable candidate for study. Similar
considerations lead us to the mix variable. Kashyap, Stein, and Wilcox
(1991) present evidence suggesting

that monetary

policy

affects the mix,

which reflects the relative importance of' bank loans versus commercial paper
in short term finance.2' Tight money constrains the ability of banks to issue
loans, this increases borrower's reliance on commercial paper. To the

extent that bank loans and commercial paper are imperfect substitutes, the
mix variable may be viewed as an indicator of credit tightness.
We begin by examining VAR systems which include

Table 4 reports the exclusion test results for whether or not GNP

21Short term business bank loans actually appear to rise following tight
money. The mix falls, therefore, because commercial paper rises faster.
Evidence from the QFR, which we report in section 4, shows that while bank
lending to large firma rises, bank lending to small firms actually contracts
following tight money. Thus, the behavior of the mix may be at least partly
explained by a compositional effect on small versus large firms.
22We also tried different lag lengths, none of which noticeably affected our

results.

All

equations are estimated over the period l960:Q2 to 1990:Q3, except for
the regression that includes the mix variable. Because the commercial paper
market did not develop unitl the mid—sixties, regressions using the mix are
estimated over the period 1965:01 to 1990:Q3.

statistically significant for two of the four lags. If one uses the risk
spread instead of the Funds rate, GNP appears to matter for large firms but
not small firms. All the coefficients on GNP are negative for large firms
however, and either significantly positive or close to zero for small firms.
Further, the pattern on the GNP coefficients of small firms relative to
large firms is quite similar across the different specifications, with the
coefficients on the 1st, 2nd and 4th lag tending to be significantly
greater for small firms than large firms, and the third lag being equal.

The risk spread produces a pattern nearly the opposite of

M2.

It is a

significant predictor for large firms but not for small firms. At the same
time, though, the coefficient patterns do not look much different between

large and small firma.28 It is also interesting that, when both monetary
variables are included, the risk spread eliminates the explanatory power of
the Funds Rate for large firms but not for small firms.25

Of all

the

for the quick decline in small firm sales in the
wake of a rise in the Funds rate is that small firms may have to sharply
Contract the offering of trade credit finance their sales. In periods of
tight money, banks may be willing to supply loans to finance inventories
(since these loans are collateralized by the inventories.) They may be less
willing to finance firms' offerings of trade credit since the collateral
value of these kinds of loans is highly Uncertain. We are currently pursuing
evidence on these possibility. See Ramey (1991) for a discussion of the
widespread use of trade credit in business sales.
28
Because the Fed did not start targeting the Funds rate until the mid
sixties, we reran these regressions using the sample period 1965:Q1-1990:Q3.
This did not change our results.
We also considered dropping the last ten years of the sample since
Bernanke argues that the rate spread is a less effective explanatdr in the
SO's than earlier. Not surprisingly, this weakened the impact of monetary
policy across both small and large firms. Although M2 was no longer
significant, the p—value was much higher for the difference in growth rates
(0.15) and for the growth rate of small firms (0.27) than for the growth
rate of large firms large firms (0.57). The Funds rate followed a similar
pattern, with p—values of 0.05, 0.11, and 0.33 for the small and large firms
respectively. Similarly, the p-values for the risk spread were 0.6, 0.65
and 0.58; thus once one drops the 80's the spread does not appear to matter
more for large firms.

35me Romer shock is not exactly comparable to the Funds rate shock, since in
the latter case, the dynamics permit the Funds rate to revert back to trend.
Another possible difference owes to the fact that asymmetries may be
present, since the credit frictions are more likley to bind in bad times
than in good times. Since the Romer dates include only tight money periods,
they may capture an asymmetric response.

insight into our results. Figure

to a credit crunch,

Concluding Remarks
Macroeconomics has traditionally focused on

the behavior

of

firms. In our view, small firms deserve attention as well. Because they
are more likely to face credit market imperfections, small firms are

particularly sensitive to

macroeconomic disturbances, including

monetary policy. The evidence in this paper

manufacturing firms.
Our coefficient estimates suggest

that the differential response of

small firms to tight money is due both to the direct impact of monetary
policy and to the- indirect impact working through the overall decline in
economic

activity (small firms are more sensitive to

movements in GNP).

Either channel is consistent with our emphasis on credit market
imperfections, since the model we developed predicts that small firms should
be excessively sensitive not only to to

fact that bank loans to small firms decline

following a rise in the Funds rate, while they instead rise for large firms,
is further evidence compatible with our emphasis on financial factors.
Could

a frictionless framework explain our results?

One possibility

that small firms are concentrated in industries that are both

highly-interest sensitive and cyclical, implying that we are merely
capturing industry effects. The data required to fully resolve this issue
is currently incomplete. The available data, however, suggests

that a

simple industry effects story is unlikely; it indicates no particular

pattern in the distribution of small firms between cyclical versus
non—cyclical manufacturing industries.

A

second possibility is

that

technological factors make small firms more volatile, perhaps because they

are generally less capital intensive (e.g. Mills and Schumann (1985)).'
However, pure technological stories could easily lead to the opposite
predictions.

for example, that large firms should have

shifts. Explaining the differential response of bank lending for small

and

large firms to Funds rate shocks also appears problematic in a perfect
markets setting.

Nonetheless, we agree that discriminating between these

various hypotheses is clearly an item deserving of further research.
A

related objective, which we are currently pursuing, is expanding the

data set

beyond

the manufacturing Sector.

Because

the percentage

of small

firms in the manufacturing sector is well below the percentage for the
economy

as a whole (see Gertler and

Hubbard (1989)),

it is quite possible

results cannot be explained by the fact that small firms are typically
less diversified. This kind of story explains why small firms may have a lot
of idiosyncratic volatility, but is does not explain systematic volatility
(i.e., co—movement with the cycle). Nor, in the absence of informational
frictions, can it explain a greater sensitivity to monetary policy.
410ur

34

that our analysis has understated the overall macroeconomic relevance of
small firms.
Finally worth noting are the results that both

M2

and the mix between

commercial paper and bank loan financing contain considerably more
predictive power for small firms than for large firms (while at the same
time, the commercial paper/ T-bill spread is a better predictor for large

firms).

Both M2 and

the mix variable are financial aggregates that are tied

closely to the performance of banking.

And small

firms have traditionally

been heavily dependent on bank financing. These kinds of financial/real

regularities should not occur in a Miller/Modiglianiworld. Our results,
therefore, are sympathetic to theories emphasizing the behavior of banks
(and, relatedly, the behavior of small firms and other "small"
borrowers) both in the monetary transmission mechanism and in the business
cycle.
