INTERNATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF STOCK RETURNS
AND VOLATILITY AS THE WORLD TURNS
ABSTRACT
This paper investigates empirically how returns and
volatilities of stock indices are correlated between Tokyo and New
York.
Intradaily data are used, so that daytime and overnight
returns are defined for both markets. Tokyo daytime hours overlap
with New York overnight hours, while New York daytime hours overlap
with Tokyo overnight hours. We find that in general Tokyo (Mew
York) daytime returns are significantly correlated with New York

during the trading hours of one market has a global impact on the
returns of the other market. One exception is that after the
October 1987 Crash, the Tokyo overnight returns were not
significantly affected by New York daytime returns. We propose and
estimate a signal extraction model with GARCH processes to determine
the global factor from daytime returns.
This is the problem of
setting the opening price of a domestic market conditional on the

significant lagged spillovers in returns or in volatilities.

in an international asset pricing modal. Growing financial market

integration implies that,

according to this type of model, changes in stock

prices in one market quickly affect those of another market (often in the same
direction).
Another reason for international correlations of stock price changes is
"market psychology." The October 1987 Crash (Black Monday) in New York setting
off worldwide stock price declines is often cited as evidence for international
contagion of bear psychology.

Speculations (or fads, noises, or even a herd

instinct) may be transmittable across borders. One survey (Shiller, Konya, and
Tsutsui (1991)) has found that Tokyo participants are influenced by what happens
in New York (and not vice versa). An excellent paper by King and Sladhwani (1990)
proposes to model such a phenomenon as a signal extraction problem.
Since Tokyo and New York do not have any overlapping trading hours, clean
tests of how information is transmitted from one market to the other can be
formulated. Decomposition of daily movement (returns and conditional volatility)
into daytime (open-to-close)movement and overnight (close-to-open) movement is
crucial for meaningful analyses.Z For example,
hypothesis can be tested:

predictable returns and conditional volatility

of one market because of the movement of the other market should be incorporated

in the opening price (that is, overnight movement). In order to carry out this
inference, a global factor end a local factor have to be separated.

For this,

the paper proposes a signal-extraction method similar to King and Wadhwani

(1990).
clustering) end "meteor showers" (worldwide volatility clustering), as proposed
in Engle, Ito and tin (1990) and Ito, Engle. and Lin (1991), can be implemented
in the stock market.
The purpose of this paper is three-fold: First, we will carefully decompose
daytime and overnight stock movements in Tokyo and in New York and pay attention
to the nonaynchronoua trading problem; second, we will estimate "contemporaneous"
correlation between the (daytime)

returns and volatility in one market and the

overnight returns and volatility of the other; and third, we will test whether
returns and volatility of one market would predict those of the other

(daytime)

market.

Related Literature
The worldwide scope of the October 1987 Crash stimulated many studies on

the international transmission of returns and volatility: Bennett and Kelleher
(1988),

name a few-

In these papers several features were claimed to be found:'

Volatility of stock prices is time-varying. It rose considerably around October
1987, but quickly decreased afterwards, even to

the Crash.

a level lower than that before

(ii) Vhen volatility is high, the price changes in major markets tend

to become highly correlated. (iii) Correlations in volatility and prices appear
to be asymmetric in causality between the United States and other countries. The
US movement affects other markets, but not vice versa. (iv) Spillovers of price
changes and volatility are found between major markets even with non-overlapping
time zones.

These features are often presented without a logical link between

between these features comes out naturally.4

In summary, our framework is based on a contagion model proposed by King
and Wandhwani (1990),

but with finer frequency so that daytime returns and

overnight returns are separated. In particular, we provide a direct test of the
contagion model,

also yields an insight into a often-made claim that correlations in international
equity prices are positively related to volatility.

Tokyo Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange
The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are

the world largest equity markets.

stock price indices for our analysis.5 The NYSE opens its trading at 9:30 a.m.
and continues trading until 4:00 p.m.

4. Aggregate

Shock Nodel

A focus of attention in the study of world equities market has been how
returns and volatilities in major markets are correlated and have changed as
financial integration has progressed.° Using a vector autoregressions approsch
to model the transmission of daily stock returns, Eun and Shim (1989) have found
that only United States stock returns can explain the movements of nine other
world stock returns, but not vice versa. Hamso, Hasulis, and Hg (1990), and King
and Wadhwani (1990) also have given empirical support to this asymmetric
transmission pattern between the New York market and the Tokyo market. The
former paper estimated that the impact of the S&P 500 Daytime returns on the
Nkkei overnight returns amounts to only 0.02 by the CARCN-in-mean model with
HA(l) errors, whereas the latter work estimates the contagion coefficient implied
by daily S&P 500 and Nikkei 225 returns ranging from 0.40 to 0.11.
In this section, we employ an aggregate stock return model, that is, we do
not attempt to decoripose unexpected daytime returns into global or local factors,
but investigate whether the (non-decomposed)unexpected daytime returns in Tokyo
14

have any impact on the overnight returns in New York.

If any information

revealed in Tokyo is relevant to the stock prices in New York, then New York
investors will use it in pricing the New York stock returns.

5. Signal Extraction Model

It is an implicit assumption in the

aggregate

shock model that all the news

revealed during the trading hours of one market has global impacts on stock
returns.

Realistically, part of the infornation revealed through trading may

affect the returns locally.

Only a global factor influences the other market.

If the market is efficient, the impacts of the global fsctor will be priced at
16

the opening of the subsequent market. The question is how investors learn about
the global factor when they do not have any precise information about the global
and the local factors.

In the signal extraction model, domestic investors are

to optimally extract the global information from the observed price
changes. Consequently, the estimate of the global information is proportional
to unexpected price changes with the proportional coefficient equal to the
assumed

variance

ratio of the global information to unexpected price changes.

Third,

This is also time-varying, so

that a time-series average over the sample period is presented.

We find, as

shown in Table 5, that the weight of the global factor revealed in Tokyo
increased after the Crash.

This suggests that the Tokyo stock returns after the

Crash contain more of a global component than before,

the variance ratio of a global factor to a local factor increased in the New York

Fourth,

we corpare the performance of the aggregate shock model with the

The signal extraction model will be nested into the

aggregate shock model because, if unexpected returns have no local impacts, then
the two models become equivalent. We compute the Weld statistics, shown in the

that the two regressors, the Tokyo overnight and the New York daytime returns,
overlap in real time. The coefficient s shows the sensitivity of the Tokyo
market returns to the New York daytime returns (of day t-l). The equation could
be regarded as a causality test of whether New York daytime returns have any
additional information (additional to Tokyo's own market overnight returns) in
predicting Tokyo daytime returns. Alternatively, the equation maybe interpreted
as the test of lagged spillover effect from New York daytime returns to Tokyo
daytime returns a half day later.

In panel A of Table 7,

investors became less

confident in calculating the impact of New York daytime returns on Tokyo, taking

The spillover appears to last more than one hour

after the opening of the Tokyo market. This, however, is a major puzzle from the
efficient market point of view.
Table

shows that there is no lagged spillover from Tokyo daytime returns

to New York daytime returns.

All information revealed in the Tokyo daytime

returns seems to be incorporated in the New York stock prices by 10:00 e.m., so
that overnight returns are affected <Tables 3 and 5), but not daytime returns.

foreign market, the global factor of the foreign market,
after the close of the foreign market but before the opening of the domestic
market,

and the overnight returns of the doreatic market.

These candidates

contain information which is available to domestic investors at the opening of
20

the market.

Hence, we are able to perform a clean test to examine whether eny

of this information will generate volatility clustering across the border.
Table 9 shows that the conditional variance of Tokyo's global factor is
influenced, for the post-Crash period, by the squared shocks observed between the
New York close and the Tokyo open (or the estimated error terms of the New York
overnight equations). Table 10 shows that New York's global factor, for the preCrash period, is influenced by the squared shocks observed between the Tokyo
close and the New York open.

However, on the whole, the effects of other

of
possible realized volatility measures do not affect the conditional variance
the global factor. In particular, there is no statistically significant effect
from the squared shocks in the global factor in one market to the conditional
variance of the other market's global factor (see the second line of Tables

9

and

10) .°

The results are different from those of Nanso et

al.

(1990) who found a

volatility spillover from the New York daytime returns to the Tokyo daytime
returns,
This difference is likeiy attributable to their use of the opening
quote of 9:01 a.m., which may contain some stale quotes, as opposed to our 10:00
a.m.

Our result conforms more with that of Susmel and Engle (1990), who used

hourly data and found that the volatility spilloversbetween New York and London
equity markets only last for one hour after the market is open.

7. Comclusiom

Using intra-daily data to decompose daily returns into

overnight returns, this paper re-assesses several characteristics that have
found in the literature on the transmission of returns and volatility among world
stock markets.

Our data, methods, and findings contain several novel aspects.

First, we define the opening price of a carket as a price index thirty minutes
(in New York) or one hour (in Tokyo) after the market is actually open, in order
to minimize the problem of stale quotes or nonsynchronous trading

It has been

suggested in the literature that spillovers take place in the direction from New
York to other markets including Tokyo, but not in the opposite direction,

In

contrast, we find that returns and volatility spillovers are generally symmetric.
Information (market fundamentals or psychology) revealed during the trading hours

of one market are taken into account in the other markets when they open.
Second, we propose two models to describe the ways that investors learn

One is the

in which investors uae the unexpected returns from the

other model for setting opening prices.

The second is the signal extraction

model in which unexpected returns are decomposed into two parts, global and local
factors,

and in which investors optimally extract the information from the

observed price changes.

We compare these two models and find that the signal

extraction mudel characterizes investors' behavior better than the aggregate
shock model.
Third, several competing hypotheses regarding lagged spillovers in both
returns and volatility are also tested.

We find some evidence of the lagged

return spillovers from New York daytime to Tokyo daytime in the period after the
Crash.

This is a puzzling finding.

We conjecture that after the Crash, Tokyo

participants needed more time to extract the global factor from the New York
market,

results in favor of volatility of spillovers. In addition, our model has several
features, such as an explicit modeling of a signal extraction problem and a onestep estimation of a multi-variate (two country) GARtH problem, that are improved
over Hamao, et al. (1990).

Hsmmo et al. (1990) find a similar spillover effect from New York returns

However, they speculate that it is due to the beginning-ofthe-dsy nonsynohronous trading problem, because they use 9:01 mm. We have used
10:00 a.m. as open so that the efficient market hypothesis will work, but still
find evidence of spillovers. King end Wedhwsni (1990) find similar effects, but
since they use the close-to-close returns of the two markets, they cannot judge
from their results whether the spillover effect is resolved in overlepping hours
or in lagged hours.
14.

This means that there are no "meteor shower" effects (in the sense of Engle,
Ito and Lin (1990)) in the stock price indices of Tokyo and New York.
