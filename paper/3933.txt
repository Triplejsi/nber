LOCAL HOUSE PRICE INDEXES: 1982-1991

ABSTRACT
We

begin with a description of three house price panel data

sets for the period 1982 to 1991. Next, we estimate a model that
assumes the three sources are derived from an underlying
unobserved price series, and we construct composite indexes that

report house prices for 135 locations. These series can be used
either as explanatory variables in studies of household
formation, housing demand, and migration or to test models of the
determinants of spatial and intertemporal variations in house

prices. Finally, we construct regional series (based,
alternatively, on census and Salomon Brothers regions) and two

national aggregates and describe their movements. Our series are
compared to other local, regional, and national series.

Empirical study of the determinants of variations in local
house prices requires a panel data set where house prices are

measured for multiple cities over a period of time. While many
studies have developed price indexes for particular localities or
for the nation, panel data for constant quality housing have not

been readily available. The three panels that we focus on are
collected by the National Association of Realtors, the American

Chamber of Commerce, and Coldwell Banker. While the latter two
purport to be constant quality series, they hold only a limited
number of attributes constant.

Panel data on local house prices are required for a variety
of studies, including the impact of housing costs on household
formation and mobility decisions.

Haurin, Hendershott, and Kim

(1991) find that house prices affect young adults choices of

whether to live with parents or independently, and whether to

live with a group or separately. It is also possible that house
prices can affect the timing of marriage and childbearing.

Winkler (1991) reports a significant influence of housing costs
on female heads' decisions about whether to form a household, and
Gabriel, Shack-Marquez, and Wascher (1991) report that high
housing prices in potential destination areas significantly
reduce immigration.

Another use of panel data on local house prices is the study
of the efficiency of the market for owner-occupied single—family

houses. Case and Shiller (1969) report that markets in four
cities are inefficient in that annual changes in prices are

2

significantly positively related to previous year annual changes.

They also (1990) find that house prices and excess returns on
housing (both leveraged and non—leveraged) are forecastable with
lagged values of such variables as real construction costs and

real per capita income growth. These hypotheses can be retested
with the broader based data set developed here.

Lastly, the determinants of local house prices are

themselves a subject of interest. Models of the price
determination process range from theoretical urban equilibrium
models (Haurin, 1980) to empirically oriented estimation models
(Ozanne and Thibodeau, 1983, and Hendershott and Thibodeau,
1990).

Understanding variations in house prices in local

markets is especially important to home mortgage insurers
(lenders, private mortgage insurers, and flA/VA) because house
price declines or slow increases are the primary ex post
determinant of mortgage default (cooperstein, Redburn, and

Meyers, 1991). The Peek and Wilcox (national data) and Gill and
Haurin (local data) papers that appear in this volume are
examples of empirical house price determination models.

Three Data Sources
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) local house price

data have been collected since 1979. Initially series for about
20 cities were collected, this number has increased to 119 by

1991. The data are collected by the Association from local
Realtor boards and include all sales recorded by the local

association. Each quarter the median house price is extracted.

3

Over time, the quality of the housing stock should rise
systematically because of upgrading of existing housing and the
entry of relatively high quality units and removal of low quality

ones. In a study of NAR data for 14 cities over 4 to 7 year time
periods, Hendershott and Thibodeau (1990) find the median house

quality rose an average of 2.0% annually. Similar results are
obtained by Case and Shiller (1987) for four cities and by Peek

and Wilcox (1991) for the U.S. In the following analysis, we use
a NAR house price series that is adjusted for intertemporal
quality variations (a 2.0% annual reduction is applied to house
price increases in all localities).

The median priced house will also vary in quality over time
because of variations in the distribution of sold houses compared

to the stock. The quality of the median house may also differ
among localities. No adjustment has been proposed to account for
these variations in NAR data; thus we model the series as being

measured with error. Our annual data report the index in the
first quarter of the year, 1982 to 1991.

Coldwell Banker reports the price of constant quality houses

near year—end for the 1982 to 1991 period. Our sample includes
105 cities surveyed in at least one year. The quality level is
defined as a 2000 square foot house with three bedrooms, two
baths, family room and two—car garage in communities that

corporate transferees would tend to lo?ate.' Some spatial
variation in quality would be expected using this standard.
Further, the data are based on only three house price

4

observations per locality; measurement error is likely. We
believe we have reduced this error by computing price levels from
1989 using the annual percentage changes in house price reported
each year.

Our sample of the American Chamber of Commerce data reports
the cost of housing for 121 cities in at least one survey year.

Their survey attempts to hold quality constant by pricing a new
house of standard quality, 1800 square feet of living space and a

lot size of 10000 square feet.2 Data are collected by various
groups ranging from local chambers to universities and state

agencies. While coverage is of the urbanized area, the use of
new houses tends to yield estimates of price variations in non—

core areas. At least five sources of house sale prices are
contacted unless a single source maintains comprehensive records

for the locality (e.g., a real estate research center). We
select their fourth quarter reports from the previous year.

A Measurement Model of Local House Price Indexes
We utilize these three data sets to obtain a "best" house
price index for the localities in which the three series are
available for the 1982-1991 period. The model of the process that
generates the three indexes is:
(INSERT FIGURE 1]

where the d are uncorrelated random normal errors and the three
observed price series are: cn =
Commerce, NAR =

National

coldwell

Banker, cc = Chamber of

Association of Realtors. The single

underlying unobserved house price series that generates the

5
observed data is pt, and e represents an unobserved random factor

that causes measurement error in PS. The links between the
unobserved series and our three observed series are through the

coefficients b. This model is an example of the measurement
submodel of Joreskog and Sorbom's linear structural relationship

model (LISREL, 1985)2 We use the maximum likelihood method of
estimation to determine the coefficients b1, their standard

errors, and measures of goodness of fit. The LISREL model also
estimates weights that can be applied to the three price series,

yielding a prediction of the underlying house price series. This
"factor score" equals the expected value of pa conditional on the

observed values of the three house price series. (Further
discussion of factor scores is contained in Bartholomew, 1987,
pp. 66—69.)

We scale p so that it has unit variance; scaling is

required to identify the model (Long, 1984, pp. 49—52). Three
coefficients are estimated, b1, b2, b3, as are the three
variances of the d's, which are assumed to be uncorrelated.

Because we have three data series, the model is just identified
(there are zero degrees of freedom), and the data fit perfectly.

This type of model is useful because it yields information about
the reliability of the three house price indexes and it allows us
to use all three series to predict p.
A drawback of this particular model is that it ignores the

tine series aspect of the data. More specifically, it does not
account for the autocorrelation of measurement errors in any of

6

the three observed price series (one observation of a locality—

year is treated the same as another). Another basic assumption
is that there is a single p, rather than differing price trends

for different qualities of housing. The CR and CC indexes
represent housing that is of higher quality than the NAB series.
Because the model is not over—Identified, we cannot test for
differences in appreciation rates among houses of different
qualities.

We can provide some average data, however. We have data for
44 NAB cities in 1982 and 1991, 82 CR cities, and 74 CC cities.
For these, the average appreciation rates for the nine year

period are: NAB = 23%, CD = 55%, and CC = 35%.

If we weight the

cities by population, the averages are: NAB = 28%, CR

cc = 32%.

47%, and

Thus, the CD appreciation rate appears to be much

greater than that for NAB and CC. However, the cities for which
the series are available differ, and thus the comparisons are
inappropriate.

This problem is resolved by comparing data sources using the

same localities. Table 1 reports unweighted and population
weighted data for cities where two of the three series exist. To
sea whether the results depend on the 1982 recession (higher

quality housing may have been more depressed and thus grew more
rapidly in subsequent years), we performed the same comparative
matched—city price appreciation calculations for the 1985—91

period. For the 33 cities where we have both CR and CR data in
both 1982 and 1991, the average aggregate increases in house

7

prices are CD = 49% and CC = 33%.

These are significantly

different at the 0.05 level, but not at the 0.1 level. Note
further that the population weighted—average difference in

indexes is only half as great (0.076 versus 0.161). Moreover,
for the 1985-91 period, the differences, unweighted and weighted
are much smaller (the unweighted means are not significantly

different at the 0.1 level). We conclude that the rates of
increase in the CD and CC series are not different. On the other
hand, the rates of increase in both the CB and CC series have
been statistically greater (at the 0.001 level) than that of the

NAR

series.
[INSERT TABLE 1]

To estimate our model, we extract a subsample of data from

the three data sets. For a locality to be included, all three
data sources must be observed in that year. Because the coverage
of the three series rises over time, our estimation sample

increases from 22 cities in 1982 to 56 in 1991. A total of 324
observations are used in the estimation representing 67 cities

for various years in the period 1982—1991. As expected from the
definitions of the series, they measure different qualities of

housing. The mean prices of the series in 1989 are: CD =

$111,188,

= $99,218, MAR = $74,203.

To scale the house price

series into the standard indexes, we compute the average house
price in each series in 1989 and divide the 1982—1991

observations by the respective average price. The three 1989
indexes average 1.0 for these common areas; all other house

8

prices are relative to this base.4
Results

The estimates of the b's are: b—CB =

b-NAR =

0.i.96.

0.265, b—CC

0.175,

The t values all exceed 17; thus we are

confident that each observed series is related to p*. Squared
multiple correlations indicate how well any particular observed
index serves as a measure of the unobserved house price index.

This value, also referred to as the reliability index, "indicates
the percentage of variation in an observed variable that is
explained by the common factor that it is intended to measure"

(Long, 1983, p. 72). We find the squared multiple correlations
are: CB = 0.818, CC =

0.734, NAR = 0.699; thus the Coldwell

Banker data appear to be most reliable. The coefficient of
determination for the model indicates how well all of the
variables measure p*, and we find its value is 0.906.6

While the single best single measure of p* in this sample is
the Coldwell Banker price index, the three series in combination

yield a better indicator. The result of the factor score

regression are used to create our underlying index p. The
weights (rescaled so that their sum is 1.0) are: w—CB

w-CC = 0.354, w—NAR = 0.266.

0.381,

To extend the results to cities

where less than three series are available, we use an ad hoc
technique of weighting any two price series in the same

proportion as the estimated weights. For example, if only NAil
and CS data are present f or a locality in some year, these
indexes are weighted as:

9

MAR: w-NAR/(w—NAR + w-Cfl)
CB: w—CB/(w—NAR +

w—CB)

0.429

= 0.571.

If only one index is available, that series is used.

We report in Table 2 the house price index for 135

localities that are MSAs or part of an NSA. Often a survey
skipped a city or began its data collection after 1982. Forty—
four localities have a consistent combination of underlying price

indexes between 1982 and 1991. In the other 91, the available
series change in at least one year, possibly inducing error in PS

at the time of the change. to determine the level of a series,
we always use the latest year in which the greatest number of

component series are available. In years of transition between
series, we set the price change equal to that of the underlying

time—consistent series.7 the resultant series are smoothed
because the errors created by switching components are reduced.

Table 3 lists the various combinations of the three price series
that generate p* allowing the reader to judge the likelihood that
a change in p' results from a change in the composition of the
index.

(INSERT TABLES 2 M4D 3 SEQUENTIALLY ABOUT HERE]

Space limits discussion of individual city data. However, a
few comparisons with the data reported by other authors in this

issue are in order. These include Hartford (Clapp, Giacotto, and
Tirtiroglu, 1991) for 1981—88, San Francisco and Oakland (Neece
and Wallace, 1991) for 1982—88, and Houston (Smith and Tesarek,

1991) for 1982—89. C—G—T find a 90% nominal increase; we have a

10

15% increase. Meece and Wallace report 106% and 77% Increases,
respectively, in San Francisco and Oakland during the 1982—88

period. Our estimates are increases of 123% and 41%,
respectively. On average, then, the two increases are about the
same, but individually the increases differ considerably

(especially for Oakland). Smith and Tesarek compute a 25% real
decline between 1984 and 1987; our calculation is a 21% real
decline.

Low cost urban areas in 1991 include some of the Oil/Mineral
Extraction cities (Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Omaha, Lincoln, and San
Antonio) and economically depressed Rapid City and Youngstown.

At the other extreme, relative large urban areas with high
nominal house prices include San Francisco (and its suburbs San

Rafael and Walnut Creek), Honolulu, Oakland, and Stamford.' The
variation in real house prices across cities is undoubtably lower
than that in nominal prices owing to the positive cross—sectional
correlation of the prices of houses and other goods.

Regional Rouse Price Series
While the primary value of our data likely lies in their
individual variation, we briefly summarize some regional series.

The U.S. was divided into eight regions by Salomon Brothers
(Hartzell, Shulman, and Wertzebach, 1988), these regions being
defined to be more homogeneous than the Census regional

breakdown. Our regional indexes are population—weighted averages
of the local house prices observed in all localities in the
region, where the 1986 population data are from the bureau of

11

census (1988)

Table 4 presents population—weighted nominal house price
levels for the eight regions in 1989 based upon an assumed
average price of $100,000 in the 33 cities where all three price
indexes are available (the number of cities in each region is

also listed). Nominal house price levels are highest in the
Northern California, including the Northwest, the Mid-Atlantic
corridor and New England, followed by Southern california,

including the Southwest. Next are the Industrial Midwest and Old
South, and prices are lowest in the Farabelt and Oil/Mineral

Extraction areas. The third column lists the number of 1990 jobs
in each region; these numbers used as weights in the construction
of a national house price index.
(INSERT TABLE 4)

to compare price movements in these eight regions over the
last decade, we have scaled prices to 1.0 in 1982 and have

plotted the resultant series in Figure 2. As can be seen, the
increase in nominal house prices in the New England region was

the largest of any (92%) during the 1982—1991 period. Following
New England were Northern California (81%), the Mid-Atlantic

corridor (69%), and Southern California (54%). Next come the
Industrial Midwest (48%) and the Old South (31%), and last are
the Farmbelt (15%) and Oil/Mineral Extraction region (5%).
Within regions, the largest nominal increases are found in 1983
through 1987 in New England and the Mid—Atlantic corridor, and in
1986—87 through 1989 in the West (both Northern and Southern

12

California). Moderate decreases in nominal house prices occurred
for New England and the Mid—Atlantic (1989—91) and the
Oil/Mineral Extraction region (1985—88).
[INSERT FIGURE 2]

The regional difference in nominal house prices increased
between 1982 and 1991, rising from a 59% differential to 164%
(Northern California compared to Farmbelt in both cases, although

Northern California prices were below New England prices in the

1986—88 period). Further research is required to understand the
causes of this divergence in house prices.

We have also computed population—weighted averages for the

four census regions. The levels, from a base of 1.0 in early
1982, for the 1982-91 period are plotted in Figure 3. Northeast
prices grew especially rapidly through 1987, and West prices grew

relatively rapidly after 1987. Prices in the Midwest were flat
through 1984, and those in the South have been sluggish
throughout the entire period.

Table 5 compares increases in our regional series during the
1984-89 period (midyear to midyear) with those of Abraham and

Schauman (1991) and the Commerce Department's constant quality
index (the latter two series growth rates are from A—S's Table

4). As can be seen, the A—S series grow more rapidly than ours
in all regions and the difference is 3.2 to 4.5% per year in all

regions except the Midwest. In contrast, our series increases
less rapidly than the constant quality series in two regions and
more rapidly in the other two, with the largest difference in

13

annual growth rate being 2.7%.

National

House Prices

We have computed two average national series by weighting
our eight regional series by the number of jobs in the eight
regions in 1990 (Salomon Brothers, 1990, p. 20) and our four

regional series by population in the regions in 1986. (We first
obtain mean price levels during each year by averaging beginning

and end of year data.) These series and a comparable one drawn
from Peek and Wilcox (1991) are plotted in Figure 3, scaled to

equal 1.0 in 1984. As can be seen, the series rise smoothly and
similarly between 1982 and 1987, after which both of our series
taper of f but the P-W series does not. For the 1984-89 period,

our 8—region series rises by 5 percentage points less than the
P—W

series, and our 4—region series rises by 10 percentage points

less. These differences cast further doubt on the house price
acceleration in the late 1980s indicated by the Freddie Mac
repeat—sales index.
(INSERT FIGURE 3]

Conclusion
We have used three published house price series to compute
"best" annual indexes for 135 local areas for the 1982—91 period.

The series utilized are those reported by the American Chamber of

Commerce, Coldwell Banker, and the National Association of
Realtors. For selected cities, we compare our indexes with those
of other authors in this volume, usually finding reasonably
comparable results.

14

The local series have been utilized to compute two sets of
regional price series based on the four regions of the Bureau of

Census and the eight regions of Salomon Brothers. Rates of
increase in the four census regions during the 1984—89 period are
then compared with the Census Bureau constant—quality regional
series and series computed by Abraham and Schauman (1991). Our
rates of increase are generally comparable to those of the Census
Bureau, but much lower than those of A&S.

The regional data sets are then further aggregated into two
annual series, and the increases between 1982 and 1989 are
compared with the annual series calculated by Peek and Wilcox

(1991), based on the Freddie Mac repeat sale index of A&S. Our
series increase comparably with the P—W series during the 1982—87
period, but the P-W series grows much more rapidly since then.
Both our regional and annual calculations cast doubt on the rapid
appreciation of house prices recorded in the Freddie—Mac repeat—
sale index in recent years.

3.

The model is also an example of confirmatory factor analysis:

A

straightforward introduction is in Long (1983).
4. In the estimation, variables are measured as deviations from their mean. We

find that for these adjusted series, the standard deviation of CB is largest

(0.29) and of CC is emallest (0.20). The covariance matrix among the three
variables

contains

six

elements:

(NAR,NAR)0.0549, (CB,CC) 0.0464, (NAR,CB)

(CB,C8)=0.0859,

(CC,CC)0.0417,

0.0520, (CC,NAR)=0.0343.

An

alternative method of deriving covariances is to select all pairwise elements
(any observation with two of the three series observed), yielding the advantage

of using more of the observed data; however, this procedure can result in
estimation

5.

problems.

The level of the coefficients is not particularly meaningful because of the

indeterminacy

6.

of the scaling of p.

We note that p is simply

the underlying

series that generates the observed

data; we cannot claim that it is the "true' house price series for the locality.

7. For example, if a location has two series until 1986 and then all three, the

level of the series is set by the value in 1991. Data for 1986 to 1991 are
consistent, so we compute levels backward from 1991 using percentage changes.
Price increases for 1982 to 1985 are also internally consistent, but the 1985 and

1986 series are not. To calculate the 1985—86 transition, we compare the result

for the two series that existed in 1985 to the result for 1986 using these same

two series. This percentage

series yielding a

change is then applied to the 1986 three—component

1985 value. Then the percentage changes from 1982 to 1985 for

the two—component series are used to calculate backwards the remainder of the

16
values.

8. We remind the reader that our list of cities is not comprehensive. A number

of major metropolitan areas are omitted (New York, Los Angeles) because the
sampled areas within the MSA changed during the 1982—91 period.

9. Our population weights are derived using cities rather than MSAs. Even with
this restriction, almost a fifth of the U.S. population resides in our 135
cities. Because the underlying house price series are based on a broader concept

of locality than the jurisdictional boundaries of a city, the local series we
report are generally applicable to urbanized areas.
