ERRORS IN OUTPUT DEFLATORS REVISITED: UNIT VALUES AND THE PPI

ABSTRACT

Extending a methodology developed by Lichtenberg and
Griliches (1989), we examine the extent of measurement error in
two independent indicators of price change: the producer price
index (PPI) and the U.S. Census Bureau's unit value relative

(UVR). Estimation of factor analytic models is improved by the
availability of more accurate and comprehensive proxies for price
and quality change within industries and a more complete

specification of the econometric model. We find that the UVR is

a "noisier measure of price change than the PPI and that the PPI
adjusts for approximately 57% of product quality change.

I. INTRODUCTION
The major difficulty associated with the accurate
measurement of industrial prices is the adjustment of price
indexes to reflect quality change.'

Improper measurement of

quality change can distort estimates of important economic

variables, such as real output or productivity growth. A recent
paper by Lichtenberg and Griliches (1989), (henceforth L-G),
based on detailed price data, finds that the Producer Price Index
(PPI) adjusts for only about two thirds of quality change,

resulting in an underestimation of 'true" (quality-adjusted) TFP
growth over the sample period (1972-1977) by about 34%.

The purpose of this study is to extend this work on
measurement error in output prices, examining two independent
indicators of price change-the BLS's PPI and the Census Unit
Value Relative (UVR) .

Our analysis is based on detailed product-

level data derived from the 1982 Indexes of Production (the L-G
study was based exclusively on the 1977 Indexes of Production
data) .

Thus, we can determine whether the PPI was a "better'

indicator of price change than the UVR (a key finding of the
earlier study) during the later period and whether recent changes
in the manufacturing sector have exacerbated errors in price

measurement. Estimation of factor analytic models of price
determination is improved by the availability of more accurate

and comprehensive proxies for price arid quality change within

industries. We also propose modifications to the econometric
model of long-run price and quality formation and estimate these
models at both the industry (4-digit SIC) and product (7-digit

SIC) levels. Our comparison of the two price indicators also
includes an analysis of a set of unit values that are

representative of a central tendency in the data.2 The
remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section Two

describes

the versions of the multiple indicators, multiple

causes (MIMIC) models we propose to estimate. The next section
contains a discussion of the data. Empirical results are

presented in Section Four. Conclusions and suggestions for
additional research are contained in the final section.

II. MODEL
The focus of L-G was to derive an empirical estimate of
long-run errors of measurement of price change in the

manufacturing sector. In their view, the major source of such
errors is unmeasured or imperfectly measured changes in product

quality. Factor analytic models of price change were estimated
using two independent indicators of price movements, the PPI and

the UVR. Weighted averages (by shipments) of price changes
between 1972 and 1977 of 7-digit SIC products (the finest level
of disaggregation of Census data) were calculated at the 4-digit

where the growth rate of product quality, Z, is expressed as

Z =

- Q, where Q denotes the growth rate of the effective

quantity of output, and Q denotes the growth rate of number of

units sold. The effective quantity of output is the quantity of
output that would have resulted if the value of shipments had
been deflated by a true quality adjusted price index.5 Thus,
the effective quantity of output is the ratio of the value of
shipments to quality adjusted price, while Q refers to the ratio

of value of shipments to either PPI or UVR. Therefore, the
difference between Q and Q is defined as the product quality.
The specifications of the PPI and IJVR equations reflect the

fact that the former includes an adjustment for quality change,

while the latter does not. The UVR is a measure of the change in
revenue per unit sold and does not include an explicit quality

adjustment.6 On the other hand, the PPI includes some
adjustment for quality change because the BLS authorities
periodically change the list of goods included in the indexes to
reflect major changes in the range of products sold and their

characteristics. BLS also adjusts prices when a change in

can be thought of as a quality-adjusted measure of the
growth in quantity.

'Actually, the measure is often based on a mix of goods that
are classified as one, based on an establishment's primary product.

discontinued products are eliminated from the price series.

In L-G, the variable NEW, which is assumed to be an

measure is problematic because it is calculated in different
units than the price measures.

In estimating the MIMIC model,

L-G normalized the parameter on Z to be one, which would be
plausible if the indicator was measured as a growth rate. The
authors do not explain why this constraint should be imposed.

Estimates of this simple model are quite sensitive to this

assumption. In fact, we find that this model cannot be estimated
when we allow this parameter to be free. To address this
problem, we have constructed indicators of quality change that
are based on the price changes of new products.8

The specification of the Z equation is based on the
assumption that product, rather than process, innovation is the
chief source of improvements in quality.9 OWNRD and SUPRD are

exogenous variable. It is probably more plausible to assume that

expenditures for product-oriented R&D conducted within the
industry and by the industry's suppliers of capital and materials
respectively, based on data from Scherer (1984) on interindustry

technology flows. Thus, the change in output quality is assumed
to be a function of R&D that is performed both inside and outside
a given industry.

We believe that equations (1) and (2) should be specified as
follows:

Both price measures are assumed to reflect the effects of an
additional latent variable, S, an industry-specific "supply

shock," or shift in the industry supply curve. Stigler and
Kindahi (1970) and others have examined the relationship between
short run movements in prices and oscillations in economic

activity. Although we focus on long-run estimates of price
change (over a five year interval), these measures are also

sensitive to fluctuations in industry supply and demand. We
believe that the distinction in the economic environment that
existed in 1977 (a relatively "normal" year) and business
conditions in 1982 (a year of severe recession in many heavy
manufacturing industries) underscores the importance of
controlling for these effects.

It is expected that the UVR is

more sensitive to these fluctuations (0 < a2

PPINEW and UVRNEW are two additional indicators of quality

change based on the price changes of new products. PPINEW is
defined as the difference between the Divisia index of PPI5 (at

the 4-Digit SIC level) for products having both price measures
and the Divisia index of PPIs for new products.

UVRNEW is based

on corresponding calculations for the unit value relative. Both
measures are adjusted for coverage in terms of shipments. In
contrast to the two-digit specific indicators of improvements in

quality used in L-G, we have constructed proxies that are based
on

the

number of new products created in each 4-digit SIC

industry.2 The corresponding price measures for these new
products are available to us because Census officials have
provided us with the complete universe of product prices.t3 As
discussed in the previous section, the BLS partially adjusts the

The change in the capacity utilization rate (DCU) is

Our construction of this measure is based on the assumption that
energy, materials, and production labor are variable factors of

production, while non-production labor and capital are fixed. It
is computed as the (unweighted) sum of changes in the cost shares

In the next section, we describe our data and the
calculation of new, more comprehensive measures of quality
change.

III. DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA
As in L-G, the major source of our data is a Special Census
Deflator Comparison File that was provided to us by the Industry

Division of the Census Bureau. The Real Product Committee, a
group of economists and officials from Census, BLS, BEA, and the
Federal Reserve Board, used this file to construct the 1982

Indexes of Production. It contains data at the (7-digit SIC)
product level on the value of shipments for the years 1977 and
1982, and all available price deflators measuring price change
between 1977 and 1982, including several variants of the PPI, the
!JVR, and other price indexes. The file also includes information
on which price measure was actually selected by the Committee and

used to deflate nominal output. We have also obtained the
original 1977 Indexes of Production product-level
data from L-G (with measures of price change between 1972 and
1977), as well data on R&D expenditures at the industry level
gathered by Scherer [1984]

Table 1 presents statistics on the percentage of shipments
deflated by various price measures in the 1977 and 1982 Indexes

of Production. This table shows that the PPI is the most
frequently selected price measure. Over two thirds (67%) of

industrial output was priced using the PPI in 1982. Prior to

13

1982, a 'scoring" system was devised to choose between the Ppi

and UVR when both prices were available for a given product.
However, in the 1982 calculations, the PPI was always selected

(over all measures) when available. Across industries, there
were large increases in the percentage of output deflated by the
PPI in the food, tobacco, textiles, apparel, and petroleum
industries (SIC5 20, 21, 22, and 29, respectively)

still, in several sectors, price measures other than the PPI
and UVR have been selected to deflate substantial percentages of

nominal output. In fact, a greater percentage of output is
deflated by other price measures than is deflated using the UVR.

We will incorporate price measures from all available sources

(i.e. Federal Reserve Board) in our statistical analysis. Given
the finding that the PPI is, in general, the most reliable
indicator of price change, errors in the measurement of output
prices could be significantly greater in industries that have
high percentages of output deflated based on alternative
measures.

It is important to note that the L-G empirical results were

based exclusively on a subset of all products-those for which

both a PPI and UVR were available. One distinguishing feature of
the data provided to us is that we have all available price

information for the complete universe of Census products. Table
2 demonstrates that products with both price measures have larger

than average sales and tend to have established, well-defined

markets. 91% of these products were "old." Products with a PPI
and UVR accounted for 18.8% and 36.8% of total products and

shipments, respectively, in 1982. It is obvious that a
substantial percentage of industrial activity is eliminated when
we restrict our analysis to those products with both price

measures. We will return to this issue in Section IV, when we
present results that are based on a more complete set of
products.

As mentioned in the previous section, we have constructed
indicators of quality change that are specific to 4-digit
sectors, based on an examination of lists of products in both

1977 and 1982. Specifically, we have identified the net number
of new products introduced (between the quinquennial Census of
Manufactures) within a four-digit category as an indicator of the
extent of quality change during the period.1617 Two alternative

definitions of new products were used. One definition requires
that a product appear for the first time in the Census

'6These measures were derived by analyzing the following Census
Bureau publications: "1977 and 1982 Numerical List of Manufactured

and Mineral Products." Appendix B of the 1982 report, entitled
"Comparability of Product Codes, was used to establish matches and
non-matches across Censuses. I am indebted to Zoe Georganta for
performing this analysis and providing me with these data.

17 Additonal data on manufacturing industries is provided by
the NBER Productivity Database, which contains annual output and
input measures for 450 manufacturing industries during the years
1958-1986.

Database created at the Census Bureau in the late 1970's and is

15

publications or had its specification changed. The term
"specification," apart from denoting technical properties, also
includes packaging, color, weight, and similar characteristics.

The second definition also considers the economic significance of

the market for a specific product. That is, a product can be
defined as new as the result of a split of a product class (5digit SIC) into a number of products, which may have existed

during the previous Census (1977), but were not listed

separately. Therefore, the second definition includes the
products defined earlier and also products that existed during

the previous period, but were not considered important enough
(usually because output was relatively low) to warrant a separate

listing. Sinilarly, we consider the antithesis of this
phenomenon, or the contraction of a number of products into only

one product class. The notion of an increasing demand for a
product is taken to represent a quality change in the sense that
an industry is providing the consumer with a new or improved
product.

Table 3 contains examples of new products created (or those
that became economically significant) between 1977 and 1982 for

several industries. For example, in the Biological Products
industry (SIC 2831), in-vivo arid in-vitro technolgies have

spawned new classes of products.

The introduction of computer

and video technology has led to the creation of new types of
'phonograph records" (SIC 3652) .

The third industry cited,

Cheese Natural and processed (SIC 2022), provides an example of

16

new products that resulted from market expansion. Each of these
products (cheese substitutes) existed in 1977, but warranted a
separate classification only when sales increased (or the number
of producers increased) substantially during the period between
Censuses.

We have calculated estimates of the number of new products
created within 4-digit SIC industries during two periods: 1972-

1977 and 1977-1982. Table 4 presents statistics on this
phenomenon aggregated to the two-digit SIC level. For the entire
manufacturing sector, there was a 25% increase in new products

generated during the latter period. However, new products as a
percentage of all products declined from 26.1% to 18.8%. These
figures demonstrate that new products consititute a faily
significant percentage of industry revenue. In SICs 35 and 38
(two sectors with many high-tech industries), new products
accounted for 26.3% and 32.0%, respectively, of 1982 sales.

In the next section, we present descriptive statistics on
product and industry prices and discuss our econometric findings.
IV.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS
We begin by constructing estimates of price change for

products having both

price

measures. To compare our findings to

the previous study, we calculate weighted averages of these

product prices at the (4-digit SIC) industry level, using the

value of shipments as weights. Summary

statistics

for the

resulting sample of 269 industries are presented in Table 6. We
have also calculated estimates of changes in the PPI and UVR at

17

the industry level based on products for which at least one of
these measures is reported (N=39l and N=324, respectively)

Results for the balanced set of industries but unbalanced set of
products (N=307) are also included in the table.

Note also that

we have included descriptive statistics on (7-digit SIC) product

prices as well. Descriptive statistics are presented for
products having both price measures (N=2048 and N=2045) and for
the entire set of PPI5 and UVRs (N=5908 and N=3411,
respectively) .

Although the MIMIC model was estimated at the 4-

digit SIC level in the previous study, we will also estimate our
version of this model using product-level data.
It is important to note that many of the unit value measures
in these large samples may also reflect changes in product mix
and other elements of noise assoicated with the reporting of
physical quantities of output.18 This raises the issue of
whether the complete set of unit values should be exmained or if
an attempt should be made to select those unit values that are

most likely to reflect true changes in prices. Gordon (1990)
criticises the L-G study for its analysis of fl

available

unit

values with a corresponding PPI. He argues that meaningful
comparisons of these two price indicators must be based on a
small set of simple basic goods with few quality dimensions.
To identify unit values that are less likely to be prone to
measurement error, we have constructed a sample that consists of

18Recall that the unit value measure is based on the ratio of
value of shipments to quantity of shipments.

18

measures that satisfy the following set of conditions:
a) Products that received a unit value score of 1 in 1977- As

described in U.S. Bureau of the Census (1983), the criterion used
to assess the homogeneity of a product (and thus, the
desirability or •score' or the UVR) is the dispersion in prices
reported by individual establishments around the industry mean

If

UVR.19

there is a small degree of within-industry dispersion

and this variable has not changed substantially over time, then

the product is assumed to be relatively homogeneous. Unit values
with a score of 1 (on a scale of 1 to 6) have a very small and
stable rate of industry dispersion in UVRs: 90 to 100 percent of

product shipments have establishment-level unit values falling
within 0.8 and 1.2 times the industry mean unit value and the
1977 rate of dispersion differs from the 1972 rate of dispersion
by less than 5 percentage points.20

b) Products having downward-sloping demand curves-For those
products reporting unit values, we observe the quantity demanded
(shipped) and implicit price of output in 1977 and 1982. This

allows us to calculate the price elasticity of demand. We
restrict our sample to those unit values with a negative
elasticity.

c) Products within (4-digit SIC) industries that do not exhibit

We calculate the UVR price

industries that have unusually high (in excess of three standard
deviations from the mean) within industry variance in prices.
d) Products within (4-digit SIC> industries having at least eight
product categories-The concept behind this restriction is that.

products that are narrowly defined are likely to be relatively

homogeneous. For example, the Census Bureau may list a number of
different size classes for compressors, screws, and other
industrial products.22 Restricting the sample to "good' unit
values with a corresponding PPI yields a sample size of 359

products and 37 industries. We have also constructed samples
that allow us to compare the PPI to good' unit values and other
price deflators as well (N=1928 products and N=348 industries)
Table 6 shows that the average change in output price
between 1977 and 1982 based on the PPI is higher than the

corresponding figure based on the UVR (.367 versus .342). For
the large industry and product-level samples ("balanced and
"unbalanced' sets of products and industries), the differences in

210ne might argue that high variance may also be due to
technological change within the industry, although as mentioned
earlier, only a very small percentage of new products have UVRs.

arbitrary.

mean values of the PPI and the UVR are positive and significantly

product case) .

the previous period, L-G found that the mean

value of the UVR was higher than the PPI. This difference was
also found to be significantly different from zero.

In the context of the simple MIMIC model, the sign of the
difference between the two measures is important if we wish to

calculate a global estimate of the growth in quality. From
equations (1) and (2), we observe that the mean difference
between the two price indexes can be expressed as:

determines the sign of the estimate of the change in product

quality. eased on estimated values of a1 and z

of

.369 and -

.028, L-C calculate that (unmeasured) product quality increased
by 4.5% during 1972-1977. We will not attempt a similar
calculation because we will estimate the two alternative
econometric models described in the previous section.
We do observe one finding that is consistent across periods:

the UVR appears to be a 'noisier" indicator of price change. In
the earlier period, the standard deviation of the UVR was 45%

greater than the corresponding figure for the PPI. For the
period 1977-1982, we find similar results: the standard
deviation of the UVR exceeds that of the PPI by 42%, by 47 when
we use fl available data on the PPI and tJVR), and by 14% for the
smallest sample.

21

The product-level values are consistent with the industry

figures. Except for the smallest sample, we again find that the
sign of the difference in the mean values of the PPI and the UVR
changes across periods and that the latter measure has a

substantially higher standard deviation.23 Not surprisingly, we
observe that the magnitudes of the differences in the means and
variances of PPI and UVR are smaller for the samples of

"homogeneous products and industries.
Table 6 also includes descriptive statistics for the

variables PPINEW and UVRNEW. Not suprisingly, the estimated
price changes at the industry level based on new products (those
that have probably experienced substantial unmeasured
improvements in quality) exceed corresponding estimates based on

products that have both price indicators (these tend to be "old
or established products) .

There is reason to suspect that

conventional measures of price change in innovative industries
may be overstated (see Trajtenberg (1990)) because of the great
difficulty adjusting price indices to reflect changes in the
characteristics of output.24

Table 7 presents moment matrices that can be used to

construct estimates of the ratio of the sample variances. As in
the previous period, the UVR measurement error variance (p22)

Our estimates of the ratio of the variances (1977-1982)

(a2)

at the industry level are 3.4, 3.8, and 4.0 (6.3 and 10.5 at the
product level> and we can decisively reject the hypothesis of
equality of variances (a12=a22)

We have used the LISREL modelling framework to compute
parameter estimates and standard errors of the MIMIC models

described in the previous section:2 For example, the expanded
version of the MIMIC model can be expressed as:

Under the assumption that the C's are mutually independent, the

above model is overidentified, with 45 sample moments and 22
independent parameters.26 In estimating this model, it is
important to relax one of the orthogonality assumptions

associated with the disturbance terms. It is possible that
product quality (Z*), as well as price, is affected by the

determinants of shifts in the industry supply curve. For
example, an increase in the price of materials may reflect an

reflected in an improvement in the quality of output. Thus, we
do not assume that C5 and £ are uncorrelated and 6

treated

as a free parameter.

given

that -j3

is

an estimate of the extent to which the ppi is

adjusted for product-quality change. As in the previous study,

we find that —

is

between 0 and 1, or that the PPI adjusts for

some, but not all, quality change.28

Before discussing our results, we note that the L-G estimate
of -l3,

based on price changes over the period 1972-1977, is

.631, implying that the PPI adjusts for about 63% of the change

in product quality. Point estimates from our model, based on the
1977-1982 data, range from .53 to .67, with an average value of

.616. Thus, our results are quite similar to those of the
previous study, especially when the model is estimated at the

industry level. Note that the estimate of the quality adjustment
parameter is slightly higher when the samples include industries
that have at least one product with both price measure' (N=307)
and all available price deflators (N=348), including non-UVP.

tm7As noted earlier, estimates from the simple MIMIC model may

not be desirable because the indicator of Z*, NEW, has been
measured in different units.

measures. By including products with only one price deflator, we
observe a greater proportion of anew" products and in general,

have a better measure of the industry's true price change. As
discussed in the previous section, goods that have both a PPI and

UVR are highly likely to be "old" products. This pattern is
somewhat surprising since we expected to find that the quality
adjustment process is more complete for existing goods with

stable demand.29 However, it is important to note that our
results do not change considerably when based on non-IJVR prices
(N=1928 and N=348)

Estimates of 2.

the quality adjustment parameter associated

with the PPI price differential, exceed those of ,

although we

cannot reject equality of these point estimates. Coefficients on
the R&D variables (3 and

ft)

are

both positive and significant,

consistent with the L-G results from the earlier period. This
signifies that product—oriented R&D, particularly R&D that is

performed by an industry's suppliers, is an important determinant

of quality change. We find that our estimates of

are reduced

when we (imperfectly, no doubt) control for quality change, as
compared to corresponding estimates from the simple factor
analysis model (see Table 7) .

Note also that the fit of the

model improves when we use product-level data.

Table 9 presents point estimates from the MIMIC model that
includes an additional latent variable, an industry "supply

shock," and its determinants. The coefficients again have the
291n principle, we could test this hypothesis.

25

expected signs. Estimates of the quality adjustment parameter, -

are slightly lower than those presented in the previous
table, with an average value of •57330 We also find that the
parameter estimates do not vary substantially when the model is
estimated at different levels of aggregation.
As expected, 132, the coefficient on S, is negative and

significant. This indicates that the UVR is significantly more
sensitive than the PPI to shifts in the industry Supply curve.
Point estimates on the PPI quality change indicator and the R&D
variables, 13,

13, and

13,

respectively,

are similar to those in

the previous table. With the exception of the change in energy
prices, we find that the coefficients on the "causes' of the

industry supply shock are positive and significant. The change
in production wages is the most important determinant of S,
while the change in materials price also has a strong impact on
this variable. Our estimates of a56 are generally positive and
marginally significant, suggesting that it is appropriate to
assume that c and C6

are correlated.

V. CONCLUSIONS
Extending a framework developed by L-G, we have examined two
independent indicators of price change, the PPI and the UVR, for

the period 1977-1982. Our analysis is based on more
comprehensive data and an econometric model that incorporates the

effects of an industry "supply shock." As in L-G, we find that

30An exception is when we restrict our analysis to a small
sample of relatively homogenous products (N=359)

26

the UVR is a noisier' indicator of price change than the PPI,
given that the ratio of their sample variances is approximately 4

to 1. We also find that the quality adjustment parameter
associated with the PPI has declined somewhat during 1977-1982,

relative to 1972-1977. Maximum likelihood estimates of an
expanded T'IIMIC model imply that about 57% of the change in

product quality was reflected in the PPI during the later period.
The corresponding estimate from L-G (based on data from 1972-

1977) was approximately 63%. Our results do not varj greatly
when based on all available price deflators (including price
measures other than the UVR), suggesting that sample selection
bias may not be a serious problem.

One of our key assumptions is that the PPI adjusts for some,

but not all, quality change. Beginning in the early 1980's, the
PPI was revised. One aspect of this revision was a change in the
nature of quality adjustment, which is now based on the theory of

output price indexes.3' These indexes measure the ratio of
(maximum) revenues associated with remaining on the same

production possibility curve in two or more periods. Thus, the
output price index holds inputs and technology constant.32

In view of the different treatment of quality change in the
revised PPI, Triplett [19881 discusses the possibility that the
downward bias introduced by a likely substantial increase in the

31

[1988]

32Based on recommendations outlined in Ruggles (1977)

27

linking procedure (an overadjustment" for quality change) may
cancel out the upward bias found by L-G for the earlier period.
In principle, however, we could test this hypothesis more
directly by examining the extent to which the PPI revisions have
been incorporated into the 1982 Indexes of Production.

Several important caveats must be mentioned. The LISREL
modeling framework assumes that all random variables have zero

means. We plan to reestimate the econometric models allowing for
intercepts, which is available in the latest version of LISREL

(Joreskog and Sorbom (1989)>. Also, estimates of these models
may be senstitive to assumptions concerning the error structure.
We also plan to reestimate the models allowing for non-zero
correlation between the disturbance terms from the price deflator
equation and those from the corresponding quality indicator
equations (c1,c2 and C1,C3 in the MIMIC model). Finally,

although it is interesting to have an estimate of the global
impact of bias in the price statistics, it would be even more
useful to examine the variation in errors of measurement across
industries.
