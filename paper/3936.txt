OPENNESS AND INFLATION: THEORY AND EVIDENCE

ABSTRACT

This paper points out and tests a straight forward but
previously unnoticed prediction of models in which the absence of
precomrnitment in monetary policy leads to excessive inflation.

Because unanticipated monetary expansion leads to real exchange
rate depreciation, and because the harms of real depreciation are
greater in more open economies, the benefits of surprise

expansion are decreasing in the degree of openness. Thus, under
discretionary policy-making, money growth and inflation will be

lower in more open economies. After presenting a simple
theoretical model demonstrating this prediction of the theory,
the paper examines the link between openness and inflation using

cross-country data. The data reveal a strong negative link
between openness and inflation.

I. INTRODUCTION

In their classic paper, Kydland and Prescott (1977) demonstrate that the
absence of precommitment in monetary policy can lead to inefficiently high

levels of inflation. When

imperfect

competition or a distortionary tax system

causes the natural level of output to be suboptimal and when monetary policy
can affect real output, policy-makers have an incentive to attempt to

create

surprise inflation. But policy cannot on average be more expansionary than
price and wage setters expect. As a result, in a one-time game without
binding precommitment the equilibrium rate of inflation is inefficiently high
and output remains at its natural rate.
Kydland and Prescott's paper has given rise to a vast theoretical
literature. The analysis of macroeconomic policy-making without preconunitruent

has been extended to multiple periods, stochastic environments, asymmetric
information, multiple policy-makers, multiple countries, and so on.1 Yet,
almost fifteen years after Kydland and Prescott's paper, there is virtually no
empirical evidence on the question of whether the mechanism identified by

Kydland and Prescott is important to actual inflations.2 One view, advocated

1 For surveys, see Rogoff (1989) and Fischer (1990). An important
earlier paper is Phelps (1967).
2 An important exception is the work of Alesina and others on "rational
partisan business cycles" (see, for example, Alesina, 1988). The results of
this work have been largely supportive of the predictions of a KydlandPrescott-style model extended to the case of multiple policy-makers (but see
Sheffrin, 1988)
1

for example by Barro and Gordon (l983a), is that Kydland and Prescott's model
is a valuable model of actual monetary policies and that it gives significant

insights into a broad range of phenomena. The other extreme, argued by Taylor
(1983), is that there are institutions or mechanisms that largely eliminate
policy-makers' tendency to attempt systematically to cause surprise inflation.
Governments appear to be able to largely overcome the dynamic inconsistency
problem in other contexts; for example, it would not be correct to deduce from
the observation that governments generally do not make enforceable promises
concerning future tax rates on capital that in seeking to understand actual
capital taxation policies we should focus on the dynamically consistent

equilibria of one-time games. In the case of monetary policy, reputational
mechanisms (Barro and Gordon, 1983b) or the appointment of "conservative"
policy-makers (Rogoff, 1985a) could overcome the tendency toward inefficiently
high rates of inflation.

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a prediction of models in

which the absence of precommitment in monetary policy leads to inefficiently

high inflation, and then to test that prediction. The source of the
prediction is straightforward. In his extension of the basic models of
dynamic consistency and monetary policy to open-economy settings, Rogoff
(l985b) notes that surprise monetary expansion causes the real exchange rate
to depreciate, and that this reduces the incentives to undertake expansion.
This observation is the source of Rogoff's result that international policy
coordination can be undesirable in the absence of precolnniitment: because

coordinated expansion by two countries cannot cause each country's currency to
depreciate against the other's, the incentive to expand -equilibrium inflation -

- is

and thus

higher under coordination. To put it differently,

by coordinating their monetary policies, two countries in effect turn

2

themselves into a single larger, and hence less open, economy; this decreased
openness reduces the harm of the real depreciation induced by surprise

monetary expansion, and thus raises equilibrium inflation. The same reasoning
leads directly to the prediction that I focus on in this paper: the more open
an economy is, the smaller is the incentive to expand, and so the lower is the

equilibrium rate of inflation. Thus models of inefficiently high inflation
arising from the absence of precominitment predict an inverse relationship

between openness and inflation.

The core of theoretical models of monetary policy without precommitment
involves policy-makers' incentives to inflate. By testing a prediction of the
models concerning a determinant of the level of inflation, I am thus testing

the central element of these models. Indeed, an important source of the
appeal of these models is that they provide a candidate explanation of modern
economies' tendency toward what many perceive to be "excessive" inflation.

The remainder of the paper consists of three sections. Section II
presents a simple model that illustrates the basic prediction that I seek to

test. Section III presents the empirical evidence concerning the relation
between openness and inflation.

I find that there is a quantitatively large,

statistically significant, and robust negative relationship between openness

and inflation, confirming the prediction of the theory. I consider several
alternative explanations of the relationship, but find that none appear to fit

the facts. I also find that the link between openness and inflation is absent
in the most highly developed countries; in these countries average inflation

rates are low and are unrelated to openness. The results thus suggest that
only a small group of developed countries have overcome the dynamic

inconsistency of optimal monetary policy. Section IV concludes.

II. AN ILLUSTRATIVE MODEL

In this section I present a simple theoretical model that demonstrates
that the benefits of a surprise monetary expansion are smaller in more open
economies, and hence that models of discretionary monetary policy predict that

inflation is higher in less open economies. The model is a straightforward
extension to an open economy setting of existing models of the macroeconomics
of imperfect competition with sticky prices (for example, Blanchard and

Kiyotaki, 1987, and Ball and Roner, 1990). Other models in the same spirit,
such as the one that Rogoff uses to show that international policy
coordination can be harmful, would yield the same prediction.

Assumptions. Consider a country whose citizens consume a continuum of

differentiated goods and that imports fraction a of those goods. a thus
measures the country's degree of openness. Let e be the change from the
preceding period in the log exchange rate, p* the change in the log price
index for foreign goods in foreign currency units, and p the change in the
log price index for domestically-produced goods in domestic currency units.
Then the rate of consumer price inflation (that is, the change in the log

CPI), x, is given by

(1)

x —

a(e+p*) + (1-a)p

Assume that an individual's utility from consumption is a CES

combination of his or her consumptions of the different goods, and let a < 1
denote the inverse of the elasticity of substitution between any two goods.
Because goods produced at home are imperfect substitutes for goods produced

abroad, an expansion of domestic output must drive down the relative price of

4

domestically produced goods:

where y is the change in log domestic output and y* the change in log
foreign output.

Assume that fraction f of domestic prices are flexible in the short
run and the remaining 1-f are rigid. (This could arise from overlapping
contracts or heterogeneous costs of price adjustment, for example. I discuss

below how f could be made endogenous.) Then

I assume that flexible prices are set according to

where upper case symbols denote log levels (rather than log changes) of the

corresponding lower case variables. Equation (4) states that the real prices
charged by firms that can adjust their prices ex post are increasing in

aggregate output. 4 measures the degree of responsiveness of the flexible
prices to output. For example, In the simple case in which labor is the only
input into production, the labor market is competitive, wages are flexible,
and there are constant returns,

would be simply the inverse of the

elasticity of labor supply. Since, as will be seen below, initially prices
are at their equilibrium values, equation (4) also holds in changes:

modeling aggregate demand.

Because of imperfect

competition, the equilibrium level of output is less than the socially optimal

level. Assuming that each good is produced by a separate firm, each firm's
ratio of price to marginal cost is 11(1-a) .

Thus, at the flexible-price

equilibrium, the marginal impact of an increase in y on welfare (with the
real exchange rate held fixed), measured in units of real output, is

.

in

addition, changes in the real exchange rate, because they represent changes in

the real price of foreign goods, also affect welfare. Since the equilibrium
level of output is one and since the fraction of goods purchased from abroad

is a , the marginal welfare impact of a rise in e+p*-p (with y unchanged)

Finally, following the standard practice in this literature, I assume a

direct cost to inflation. because it seems realistic, I assume that it Is CPI

that the cost of inflation is associated with domestic inflation would not

Since

it follows

immediately from (l0a)-(lOc) that the effect of a monetary expansion on output
is smaller in a more open economy, and that its effects on both domestic and

7

CPI inflation are larger. Thus the output-inflation tradeoff facing policy-

makers (measured as either dy/dp or dy/dx )

is

less favorable in a more

open economy. The impact of an increase in money growth on the real exchange
rate, in contrast, is independent of openness. But since the welfare cost of
a given real exchange rate depreciation is larger the more open the economy --

since

a larger fraction of goods are purchased from abroad -

- real

exchange

rate depreciation provides a greater disincentive to expansionary monetary
policy in more open economies.

The intuition for these results is straightforward. A monetary
expansion with sticky prices raises output at home relative to output abroad.
Inducing consumers to buy more domestic goods relative to foreign goods
requires that the relative price of domestic goods fall --

that

is, that there

be real depreciation.3 This depreciation affects inflation through two

channels. First, foreign goods prices are a component of the CPI, and so
depreciation directly increases CPI inflation. Second, depreciation raises
the costs of domestic firms. For example, if nominal wages are at all

flexible, the rise in the CPI causes wages to increase. Thus flexible-price
firms raise their prices by more than they would without the depreciation,
again increasing inflation.

The more open the economy, the larger is the weight of foreign goods in
the CPI. Thus the impact of the monetary expansion on both CPI inflation and

domestic price inflation is larger in a more open economy. As a result, more
of the monetary expansion is translated into higher prices, and less into

Note that, as long as domestically-produced goods consumed at home and
imports are imperfect substitutes, real depreciation is necessary even if the
country faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its export goods. Thus the
central results of the model would also hold in a model of an economy that
produced services and protected manufactures for domestic consumption and
primary commodities for export.

higher output.

In addition, the more open the economy, the smaller is the impact of the

monetary expansion on foreign output. The reasoning parallels the analysis

above: when a is large, the home economy is small relative to the foreign
economy, and so the real appreciation for the foreign country has little
impact of foreign firms' prices, and hence little impact on foreign output.
Thus increased openness reduces the impact of a monetary expansion on both

home and foreign output. With the specific assumptions I have made, the net
effect is that the impact on the real exchange rate is independent of the

degree of openness. But, because foreign goods represent a larger share of
consumption in a more open economy, both the direct welfare cost of the real
depreciation and its impact on inflation (measured using either the CPI or
domestic prices) are greater in a more open economy.

Equilibrium inflation. To complete the model it is necessary to specify

Allowing the fraction of firms with flexible prices (

Because the basic mechanism through which increased openness reduces
equilibrium inflation is straightforward, the central results of the model - -

that

increased openness worsens the output-inflation tradeoff and lowers

equilibrium inflation --

are

quite robust. For example, assiuning that foreign

output and prices are unaffected by domestic monetary expansion does not

change these conclusions. The same is true of allowing the effect of domestic
output relative to foreign output on the real exchange rate and the welfare
benefit of increased output -

of which are currently determined by a

by separate parameters. Similarly, the choices of whether it is CPI inflation
or domestic price inflation that is relevant for firms' price setting
decisions, for money demand, and for the costs of inflation are not important
to the model's conclusions.

economy. Under natural assumptions -- for example, that the distribution of
costs of having a flexible price is the same in the two countries and that the
variances of the surprise monetary shocks in the two countries are equal -the fraction of firms with flexib1e prices will therefore be larger in the
more open economy. This would provide another channel through which increased
openness worsened the output-inflation tradeoff, and would therefore cause
increased openness to lower equilibrium inflation even further.

III. THE EVIDENCE

In this Section I use cross-country data to test the prediction of the
theory that inflation will be higher in less open economies.

Sample and Data. I focus on the modern exchange rate system that began
in 1973. Because the Bretton woods system that existed before 1973 limited
countries' ability to pursue independent monetary policies, the post-1973
regime appears to provide a better setting for testing the theory.

I begin with as broad a sample of countries as possible. There is no a
priori reason to expect the predictions of the theory to apply only to certain
types of countries.5 And the basic variables that the theory focuses on --

inflation

and the import share - -

with relative ease.

can

be measured, at least approximately,

My basic sample therefore consists of all of the non-

centrally planned economies listed by Summers and Heston (1988) for whom data

on openness and inflation are available. This sample consists of 114
countries.6 I also investigate the relationship between openness and
inflation for a variety of narrower samples.

In particular, the fact that many developing countries are on fixed
exchange rates does not provide a reason to exclude these countries from the
sample. For a worldwide fixed exchange rate regime like the Bretton woods
system, one can make a case that it could serve to coordinate or precoinmic
policy. But it is difficult to see how just a stated policy by a country that
it plans to hold its exchange rate fixed can serve as a precornmitment or
coordination device; certainly many countries with 'fixed" exchange rates
change their exchange rates ex post.
Seven non-centrally planned economies listed by Summers and Heston are
excluded from the sample because of insufficient data. They are Afghanistan,
Angola, Chad, Cuinea, Iraq, Mali, and Mozambique.
12

National accounts data are from the International Financial Statistics

of the International Monetary Fund.7 Inflation is measured as the change in
the log CDP or CNP deflator. For countries for which this series is not
available, I use the change in the log Cr1 instead (this series is from IMF,

1986a). Openness is measured as the average share of imports in GDP or CNP

over the years beginning in 1973. Again, the standard IFS series is
unavailable for a few countries; for these countries I use an alternative

series also constructed by the IMF (IMF. 1988). Although the two measures of
imports are slightly differently conceptually (see IMF, 1988, pp. v-viii),

when both measures are available they are similar. Finally, data on real
income per capita --

specifications --

which is used as a control variable in some

are from Summers and Heston; I use the figure for 1980,

since this is approximately the mid-point of the post-1973 period and since

1980 is a benchmark year for Summers and Heston. Table Al at the end of the
paper presents the basic data used in the tests.

Specification. A few countries in the sample have extremely high
average inflation rates. Thus the parameter estimates from a linear
regression would be determined almost entirely by a handful of observations.
A simple change that reduces the importance of the countries with extreme
inflation rates is to consider the log rather than the level of average

inflation. Thus my basic specification is a regression of the log of average

The IMF does not provide data for Taiwan. These data (which are
comparable to the standard IFS data) are therefore taken from the Statistical
Yearbook of the Republic of China.

inflation on a constant and the degree of openness.8

My other specifications differ from the basic one by controlling for
other factors.

I consider three types of control variables. The first is

real income per capita; this can serve as a general measure of development,
and thus may capture a variety of factors that influence average inflation.
The second is a set of dummy variables for OECD membership and for various
regions; these too are likely to be correlated with factors that influence

average inflation. The third are dummy variables for the use of the CPI
rather than the GDP deflator to measure inflation and for the alternative

measure of openness; these capture any differences in the average levels of

the alternative measures. Note that the exclusion of any factor that could
potentially affect average inflation biases the coefficient on openness only

if the omitted factor is correlated with openness. Thus, since there is no
reason to expect such potential determinants of the average inflation rate as
political stability, the independence of the central bank, and so on to be
correlated with openness, the exclusion of variables capturing these
additional influences on inflation is unlikely to cause bias.9

Basic results. Figure 1 and Table 1 present the results for the broad
sample of countries.

Considering log inflation would not be appropriate if some countries
had very low average rates of inflation, since the logarithmic transformation
would give those countries undue weight in the regressions. No countries in
the sample have extremely low inflation rates, however; the lowest average
rate (Singapore's) is 3.6%.
The alternative strategy of attempting to add measures of as many
political and economic determinants of the average inflation rate as possible
to the regression would result in a drastic reduction in the sample size.
Cukierman, Edwards, and Tabellini (1989) investigate the link between
political stability and inflation.
14

Figure 1 is a scatterplot of the wean rate of inflation since 1973

(measured on a logarithmic scale) against the degree of openness. The figure
shows a negative relationship between openness and inflation. The

corresponding regression is reported in the first column of Table 1. The tstatistic on openness is -3.8: there is a statistically significant negative
relationship between openness and inflation, just as the theory predicts.

Moreover, the estimated impact of openness on inflation is quantitatively

large. The point estimates in Column 1, for example, imply an average rate of
inflation of 18% for a closed economy, 14% for an economy with an import share
of 25%, 11% for an import share of 50%, and 8% for an import share of 75%.
Finally, the fraction of the variation in inflation explained by the

regression is non-trivial: openness alone accounts for over ten percent of
the cross-country variation in average inflation rates.10

The remaining columns of Table 1 investigate the robustness of this

result to some simple changes in specification. In Column 2 I add dummy
variables for the use of the CPI to measure inflation and for the alternative

measure of the import share. This change alters the results only trivially.
In Column 3 I also add log real income per capita to the regression. The
regression suggests that higher real income is associated with a modest

decline in average inflation. The estimated impact of openness on inflation

As Figure 1 shows, two countries in the sample --

Singapore and

Leotho -- have average ratios of imports to CDP in excess of 100%. In the
case of Singapore, this simply reflects the facts that imports and exports are
measured in terms of gross value and CDP in terms of value-added, and that
value-added in Singapore is low relative to the gross value of imports. In
the case of Lesotho, the ratio in excess of 100% arises from the use of CDP
rather than CNP as the measure of output and the importance of labor income
earned abroad to that economy. Thus ratios of imports to GDP over 100% do not
indicate data errors. Nonetheless, one might be concerned that these few
extreme observations had an excessive influence on the results. Reestimating
the regressions with Singapore and Lesotho excluded, however, lowers the tstatistic on openness only modestly.

Column 4 reports the results of including dummies for OECD membership,
the major oil producers, South America, Central America (including the

Caribbean), and Africa. The coefficients on the dummies (which are not
reported in the table) confirm that there are differences in inflation rates

across regions. The dummy for South American countries is large (1.17) and
highly significant; those for Africa and Central America are of moderate size
(.20 and .30, respectively); and those for OECD membership and the oil

producers are small (.09 and .06). The null hypothesis that the coefficients
on the dummies are all zero is strongly rejected. The estimated link between
openness and inflation, however, is little changed: the coefficient is about
eighty percent of its previous value, and the t-statistic remains greater than
3.

Robustness across samples. Table 2 investigates the results for a
variety of sub-samples. For each sample I report the results only for the
specification that includes log real income per capita and the dummy variables

for the use of alternative data sources. Exclusion of these control variables
or inclusion of the regional dummies has little effect on the results.

Column 1 excludes countries with average inflation rates greater than

30% from the sample. The estimated coefficient on openness is smaller than
before, but the t-statistic remains in excess of 3. Thus the results do not
depend on a few countries with extreme inflation rates.
Column 2 eliminates several types of countries whose monetary policies
are closely tied to those of other countries, and to whom the model thus does

Because real income is an extremely poor index of development for the
major oil producing countries, all regressions that include real income are
also estimated with the oil producers excluded from the sample. This change
has no important effect on the results.

RESULTS FOR NARROWER SAMPLES

TABLE 2

not clearly apply. Specifically, I exclude the members of the two Francophone
African monetary unions, the members of the European Monetary System, and two
countries (Liberia and Panama) that employ U.S. dollars rather than domestic

currencies. This change has virtually no effect on the coefficient on
openness, although the standard error does increase slightly.

Column 3 restricts the sample to countries for whom reliable data are
available -

- specifically,

countries whose national accounts data receive a

rating of "C" or better from Summers and Heston, for whom the alternative
measures of inflation and the import share did not have to be used, and who

are not major oil producers. This sample consists of 63 countries. The point
estimates imply a larger impact of openness on inflation than does the

corresponding regression for the full sample (Column 3 of Table 1). The tstatistic on openness, however, is somewhat smaller.

Columns 4 through 8 of the table examine the relationship between
openness and inflation within regions (again considering the OECD as a

"region"). For each region, the point estimates offer support for the
predicted negative relationship. There is also no evidence that the
relationship differs across regions; the null hypothesis that the coefficients

on openness are equal for all regions cannot be rejected. Given the small
sample sizes, however, the coefficients for the regional sub-samples are
generally insignificant.

The robustness of the result is not surprising. The 15 most open
economies in the sample all have average inflation rates of less than 14%, and

13 have rates less than or equal to the sample median of 11%. At the other
extreme, the 10 most closed economies include 6 of the 14 countries with
average inflation rates over 30%.

It is difficult to see what characteristic

differentiates such low inflation countries as Bahrain, Barbados, Guyana,

17

Malaysia, Malta, Mauritania, the Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, Singapore,
Surinam, and Tunisia from such high inflation countries as Argentina, Brazil,
Ghana, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Sudan, Turkey, and Uganda other
than the fact that the former are quite open and the latter relatively closed.
Although the results are generally robust across subsamples, there is no
evidence that the prediction of the theory holds for the most highly developed

countries. Consider for example the 18 wealthiest countries in the sample
other than the major oil producers.'2 Among these countries, there is
virtually no link between openness and inflation, although a two standard
error confidence interval also includes large negative values (Column 9 of

Table 2). More important, average inflation rates in these countries are low.
The average for the 18 is 8.7%, and the regression equation for the full
sample, even controlling for per capita income (Column 3 of Table 1),

underpredicts inflation for 17 of the 18.
Outside this small group of highly developed countries, in contrast,
average inflation rates are high and are strongly related to openness.

The

average inflation rate for the set of 96 countries that excludes the highly

developed 18 is 18.9%. In this sample, controlling for per capita income, the
t-statistic on openness is -4.6, and the point estimates imply that for a
country with per capita income equal to the sample median, average inflation
falls from 21% to 8% as openness rises from 0 to 75% (Column 10 of Table 2).
Finally, openness accounts for a substantial fraction of the variation in

inflation among these countries: a simple regression of the log of average

12 The countries (listed in order of 1980 per capita income) are the
United States, Canada, Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Germany, France,
Denmark, Japan, Iceland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Australia,
Austria, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. For comparison, the next
wealthiest countries (again excluding major oil producers) are Hong Kong,
Italy, Trinidad and Tobago, Israel, Spain, Singapore, Ireland, Malta, Uruguay,
and Barbados.

inflation on a constant and openness has an R2 of .17.

Thus the data are consistent with the view that there Is a group of
approximately 15 to 20 highly developed countries that have found some means
of solving the problem of dynamic inconsistency of optimal monetary policy.
For these countries, average rates of inflation are low and are unrelated to a
measure of policy-makers' incentives to attempt surprise monetary expansions.
in the rest of the world, on the other hand, the problem of dynamic

inconsistency does not appear to have been solved: average rates of inflation
are much higher and are strongly related to the benefits of expansion.13

Alternative Explanations. The natural interpretation of the negative
association between openness and average inflation is that greater openness
reduces policy-makers' incentives to undertake surprise monetary expansions,

and thus results in lower inflation. In this section I consider two
alternative explanations of this link.

The first possibility is that openness is endogenous. The ratio of
imports to GD? depends not just on a country's size in the theoretical model --

but

- the

variable emphasized

also on the country's policy choices. It is

possible, for example, that countries that adopt protectionist policies also
adopt other policies benefiting special interest groups, and that this in turn
leads to large budget deficits and hence to high rates of inflation to

13 For the sample that excludes the 18 highly developed countries, there
is no evidence either than average rates of inflation are declining in income
or that the link between openness and inflation weakens as income rises. In
this group of countries, average inflation is in fact increasing in average
income (Column 10 of Table 2). And when an interaction term between openness
and log real income is added to the regression, its coefficient is negative
and significant, suggesting that the inverse link between openness and
inflation becomes stronger rather than weaker as income rises. Thus the data
are not at all supportive of the view that the extent to which countries have
solved the dynamic inconsistency problem is a smoothly increasing function of
their level of development.
19

generate seignorage revenues. If so, a negative correlation between openness
and inflation could arise through this channel rather than through the impact
of openness on policy-makers' incentives to pursue expansionary policies.
To address this possibility, I reestimate the basic regressions by
instrumental variables, treating openness as endogenous and using a country's

land area (in logarithms) as an instrument. Data on land area are listed in
the final column of Table Al. A country's land area is not determined by its
current policies. Thus land area can reasonably be assumed to be uncorrelated
with the policy determinants of the ratio of imports to CD?. At the same
time, land area is strongly negatively correlated with openness. A regression
of the ratio of imports to GD? on a constant and log land area produces a tstatistic on log land area of -9.5 and an R2 of 0.45.

Table 3 reports the instrumental variables estimates. The IV estimates
of the impact of openness on inflation are in fact larger than the OLS

estimates. In the simple regression of the log of average inflation on
openness and a constant, for example, the IV estimate is -1.32 while the OLS
estimate is -1.01.

In addition, the IV estimates are always highly

significant. Hausman tests fail to reject the null hypothesis that the IV and

OLS

estimates are equal. Thus there is no evidence that possible endogeneity

of the import share is the source of the negative association between the
import share and average inflation.

The second alternative explanation that I consider is that the negative

association between openness and inflation reflects considerations involving
the government budget and seignorage rather than the absence of precommitment

in monetary policy. The argument takes two specific forms. First, the amount
of revenue generated by a given tariff is increasing in the openness of the

economy. Thus the governments of smaller countries may obtain larger

fractions of their revenues from tariffs, and may therefore rely less on other

sources of revenue, including seignorage. The result may be lower rates of

inflation.' Second, the elasticity of demand for domestic currency with
respect to the inflation rate may be higher in more open economies: greater
trade may make foreign currencies more easily available, and may therefore

make it easier for residents to obtain substitutes for domestic currency. If
this is the case, then the optimal tax rate on domestic currency -inflation rate --

is

the

lower in more open economies.

Although these budgetary arguments are not a priori implausible, three
pieces of evidence strongly suggest that they do not account for the negative

association between openness and inflation. First, tariffs and seignorage are
much more important sources of revenue for poor countries than for rich ones.
The average share of central government revenue in 1980 obtained from tariffs
is 3% for the 18 highly developed countries, 11% for countries with per capita
incomes between $4000 and $7300, 26% for countries with per capita incomes
between $1000 and $4000, and 32% for countries with per capita incomes below

$1000. Similarly, the average shares of revenue coming from seignorage for
these four groups of countries are 0%, 2%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. (IMF,

l986b, pp. 8-9, 24-25.)' Since the budgetary arguments rest on the
importance of these revenue sources, they predict that the link between

openness and inflation will decline as per capita income rises. This
prediction can be tested by adding an interaction term between openness and

log real income per capita to the regressions. If the link between openness

14

This

argument is made by Cukiernian, Edwards, and Tabellini (1989).

' Since per capita income is a very poor measure of development for the
major oil producers, these countries are excluded from the calculations.
Including them in either the $4000-$7300 or the $l000-4000 group has little
effect.

21

and average inflation lessens as tariffs and seignorage decline in importance,
the coefficient on the interaction term will be positive.

There is no evidence that the relationship between openness and
inflation becomes weaker as income rises. Despite the fact that the opennessinflation link is absent among the most highly developed countries, for the
full sample the interaction term enters with a negative coefficient, contrary

to the prediction of the budgetary explanation of the results, In the
regression analogous to Column 3 of Table 1, for example, the coefficient on

the interaction variable is -0.37 (with a standard error of 0.28). The point
estimates imply an effect of openness on log inflation that increases from
-0.55 to -1.33 as 1980 real income per capita rises from the 25th percentile

($730) to the 75th ($5974) among the countries in the sample. The hypothesis
of no interaction cannot be rejected. Moreover, the data appear inconsistent
with the view that the effect declines substantially as real income rises.
Even if the true coefficient on the interaction variable were two standard
errors larger than the point estimate, the effect of openness and log average
inflation would change only by 0.41 as real income rose from its 25th

percentile value to the 75th percentile)6
Second, the importance of tariff revenue, and the strength of the link
between country size and the use of tariffs, are much too small to account for

the size of the link between openness and inflation. Because even very small
countries obtain only moderate fractions of their revenues from tariffs, the
use of tariffs does not free these countries from the need to obtain

16

Excluding the oil producers (for whom per capita income is a poor
measure of development) changes these results only trivially. When the 18
highly developed countries are excluded, the coefficient on the interaction
term increases to -0.72 and becomes significant. With regional dummies
included, however, the coefficient remains negative but returns to being
insignificant.
22

significant revenues from other sources. Consider for example a regression of
the fraction of central government revenue obtained from tariffs on a
constant, openness, the dummy for the alternative measure of openness, and log

real per capita income.'7 The coefficient estimates from this regression
imply that for a country with per capita income equal to the sample median, as
the share of imports in GDP falls from 60% to 20%, the fraction of the
government's revenue coming from tariffs falls from 27% to 18%; thus the

fraction coming from sources other than tariffs rises by about 13%. The basic
openness-inflation regressions (for example, Column 3 of Table 1), however,
imply that the same change in openness is associated with an increase of 50%

in average inflation. It is simply not plausible that this very large
increase in inflation could be the result simply of shifting away from tariffs

toward all other revenue sources. This could occur only if seignorage
revenues were only very slightly increasing in the inflation rate; as I

describe below, this does not appear to be the case. Thus it appears that the
tariff-based explanation can account for at most a small part of the opennessinflation relationship.

The third piece of evidence that the budget-based explanations of the
results are not correct is that the elasticity of money demand also does not
appear to vary in a quantitatively important way with the degree of openness.
Fair (1987) and Driscoll and Lahiri (1983) estimate money demand functions for

8ecause of the obvious simultaneity problem -- increased reliance on
tariffs reduces measured openness -- the regression (like those in Table 3) is
estimated by instrumental variables, treating openness as endogenous and
employing log land area as an instrument. The data on tariff revenue are for
1980 and cover 97 of the 114 countries; they are from the IMF (1986b. pp. 2425)

23

large groups of countries.18 Fair focuses on developed countries; his sample
consists of twenty OECD members and six less developed countries. He
estimates money demand with the interest rate entered both in logarithms and
in levels; the dependent variable is the log of the real money stock in both

cases. Driscoll and Lahiri consider twelve less developed countries. They
use the inverse of velocity as their dependent variable and inflation (rather
than the interest rate) as their measure of the cost of holding money, and
inflation is entered linearly.

Table 4 presents simple regressions of these estimates of the interest
or inflation sensitivity of money demand on the degree of openness.19 The
results suggest a small and statistically insignificant effect of openness on

the slope of the money demand function. All of the estimated coefficients are
insignificant, and in one case the regression suggests that money demand is in

fact less elastic in more open economies. In addition, both Fair's and
Driscoll and Lahiri's estimates suggest that the elasticity of money demand is

small (less than 0.1), even in quite open economies.2° Thus the possible loss
of seignorage revenues is unlikely to be a central determinant of the average

inflation rate in most situations: over the retevant range, higher inflation

18 The measure of money used by these authors is the sum of currency and
demand deposits rather than high-powered money, which is what is relevant for
seignorage. But the argument that the interest elasticity of the demand for
high-powered money is higher in more open economies appears to apply equally
well to the demand for currency and demand deposits.
19 Fair's estimates are from his Table 1; Driscoll and Lahiri's are from
their Table 1. Adding the log of average inflation or the log of per capita
income to the regressions has no important effect on the results.
20 To convert the fitted semi-elasticities in Column 2 into elasticities
it is necessary to multiply by the interest rate; since Fair enters the
interest rate in percent, for an interest rate of 15% the fitted values must
be multiplied by 15. For Column 3, the conversion factor is the product of
velocity and the inflation rate. Thus for inflation of 15% and velocity equal
to 5, the fitted values must be multiplied by 75. The resulting elasticities
are consistently less than 0.1.

In sum, both budgetary explanations of the link between openness and
inflation are contradicted by the fact that the link does not become weaker as

real income rises. In addition, the basic mechanisms underlying both
explanations appear much too weak to account for the magnitude of the

openness-inflation link: small countries obtain only moderately more revenues
from tariffs than large countries, and the elasticity of money demand is small
and is at most only slightly increasing in openness.

21 The evidence from hyperinflacions (both historical and modern) also
suggests small inflation or interest elasticities of money demand. Despite
vast increases in inflation, real money holdings (and real high-powered money
holdings) typically fall by much less than a factor of ten in hyperinflations.
The estimates in Cagan's classic study, for example, imply that the long-run
inflation elasticity of money demand is generally less than 0.1 for inflation
rates less than 20%, and that the inflation rate that maximizes steady state
seignorage is typically not reached until inflation (measured as the change in
the log of the price level) reaches about 300% (Cagan, 1956).

25

IV. CONCLUSION
This paper demonstrates that average rates of inflation are lower in
more open economies. This relationship is statistically significant,
quantitatively large, and robust. It holds over a wide range of countries,
with the exception of a small group of highly developed countries in which

average inflation rates are low and unrelated to openness. Finally, the
relationship accounts for a moderate amount of the overall cross-country
variation in average inflation rates.

The paper also proposes an explanation of this relationship. Because
unanticipated monetary expansion causes real exchange rate depreciation, and
because the harms of real depreciation are greater in more open economies, the
benefits of surprise expansion are a decreasing function of the degree of

openness. Thus if the monetary authorities' temptation to expand is an
important determinant of inflation --

that

is, if the absence of binding

precommitment is important to monetary policy - -

monetary authorities in more

open economies will on average, expand less, and the result will be lower

average rates of inflation. This interpretation of the results implies that
the most highly developed countries may have found some means of overcoming
the problem of dynamic inconsistency of optimal monetary policy, but that the

remaining countries of the world have not. The paper considers two other
candidate explanations of the inverse relation between openness and inflation,

one based on endogenous openness and one based on how governments' ability to
collect different types of revenue varies with openness, and finds that
neither fit the facts.

26

These findings suggest that models in which the absence of precommitment
in monetary policy leads to inefficiently high average levels of inflation are

essential to understanding inflation in most of the world. The results also
suggest that increased economic cooperation and integration, particularly
outside the most highly developed countries, should be viewed with caution:
in the absence of some mechanism to overcome the dynamic inconsistency
problem, increased integration may lead to large increases in average
inflation.
