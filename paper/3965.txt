TWENTY-TWO YEARS OF THE NBER-ASA QUARTERLY ECONOMIC
OUTLOOK SURVEYS: ASPECTS AND COMPARISONS OF FORECASTING PERFORMANCE

ABSTRACT
The National Bureau of Economic Research, in co-operation with the American Statistical
Association, conducted a regular quarterly survey of professional macroeconomic forecasters for 22 years

beginning in 1968. The survey produced a mass of information about characteristics and resultsof the
forecasting process. Many studies have already used some of this material, but this is the first
comprehensive examination of all of it.
This report addresses several subjects and produces findings on each, as follows:

(1) The distributions of error statistics across the forecasters: the dispersion among the individual
predictions is often large and it typically increases with forecast horizon, as do the mean absolute (or
squared) errors.
(2) The role of the time-series properties of the target data: the more volatile the time series, the

larger as a rule are the errors of the forecasts.

(3) The role of revisions in "actual" data: forecast errors tend to be larger the greater the extent
of the revisions.

(4) Differences by subpcriod: there is little evidence of an overall improvement or deterioration in
forecasts between the l970s and the 1980s.

(5) Combining the individual forecasts into group mean or 'consensus" forecasts: this generally
results in large gains in accuracy.

(6) Comparisons with a well-known macroeconometric model: the group forecasts are more
accurate for most but not all variables and spanS.

(7) Comparisons with state-of-the-art time series models: the group forecasts and at least half of
the individual forecasts tend to outperform Bayesian vector autoregressive models in most (but not

all) cases. The univariate ARIMA forecasts arc generally the weakest.

1. Introduction

Human action has always been to a large extent oriented to the future. Since
ancient times, man hoped to outwit fate and survive by magic divination; he also hoped to

outwit nature and others by shrewd calculation. Attempts to predict the future, therefore,
are as old as magic, but they are also as old as commerce, saving and investment. Their
motivation must have always been largely economic, despite the inevitable frustrations of
economic forecasting.

Great foresight in business matters is presumably highly profitable and rare. Its
possessor will do well to exploit it directly for personal enrichment, hence should not be

inclined to offer its products to the public in the open market. An economist who
perceives competitive markets as working with reasonable efficiency should not expect any

forecasts of stock prices or interest rates to be both freely traded and consistently much
better than average. Forecasting macroeconomic aggregates such as real ON? and its major

expenditure components is likely t have less potential for direct profitability than
forecasting financial variables. Hence, it is presumably less vulnerable to that old American

adage rebuking expert advisers: "If you're so smart, why ain't you rich?' (cf. McCloskey
1988).

For reasons explained in part 2 below, macroforecast assessments, to be interesting
and robust, should cover a broad range of forecasters, variables, and economic conditions.

The forecasts must be explicit, verifiable, and sufficient to allow a responsible appraisal.

2

Unfortunately, most of the available time series of forecasts are short and none are free
of some gaps, discontinuities and inconsistencies. Relying on a small sample of specilic
forecasts from an individual source risks overexposure to isolated hits or misses due to
chance. It is therefore necessary to concentrate on a set of forecasts from numerous and
various sources. This is likely to improve the coverage by types of information and methods
used as well.

The way to collect the required data is to conduct regularly, for a sufficiently long
time and with appropriate frequency, a survey that would be reasonably representative of

the professional activities of macroeconomic forecasters. A joint project of the National
Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and the Business and Economic Statistics Section

of the American Statistical Association (ASA) had the purpose of accomplishing just that.

The NBER-ASA survey assembled a large amount of information on the record of
forecasting annual and quarterly changes in the U.S. economy during the period 1968:4-

1990:1 (86 consecutive quarters). It reached a broadly based and diversified group of
persons regularly engaged in the analysis of current and prospective business conditions.

Most of the responding economists came from corporate business and finance, but
academic institutions, government, consulting firms, trade associations, and labor unions
were also represented. The forecasts covered a broad range of principal aggregative time

series relating to income, production, consumption, investment, profits, government
purchases, unemployment, the price level, and interest rates. The surveys also collected

3

data on the methods and assumptions used by the participants and on the probabilities they

attached to alternative prospects concerning changes in nominal or real GNP and the
implicit price deflator.

The NBER-ASA data have their shortcomings, the main of these being probably the

high turnover of participants and large frequency of gaps in their responses. The collected

data represent a mixture of public and private predictions. The survey members, generally
professional forecasters, were identified by code only. Their anonymity helped to raise the

survey response rates but may have had otherwise ambiguous consequences (encouraging
the independence of judgment? reducing the sense of individual responsibility?).
The initiative to develop and maintain the quarterly NBER-ASA survey was strongly
motivated by the desire to make it "the vehicle for a scientific record of economic forecasts'
(Moore 1969, p. 42.5). The expectation that such a survey would be of considerable service

to both the profession and the public was shared by Moore with others who helped to

implement his proposal (including one of the authors of this paper who had the
responsibility for reporting on the NBER-ASA survey during the entire period of its
existence). In retrospect, it seems fair to say that the assembled data do indeed provide
us with rich and in part unique information, which can help support much needed research

on the potential and limitations of forecasting economic change.

Twenty-two years of a survey that attracted numerous responses from a varietyof

sources each quarter add up to a mass of information about the processes and results of

4

macroeconomic forecasting. Although many studies have already used some of this
material, much of it was, and still is, to be explored. This report is the first to examine all

the variables included in the NBER-ASA forecasts, for all horizons and over the entire
period covered. It concentrates on the properties of the distributions of summary measures

of error, by variable and span of forecast, viewed against the background of descriptive

statistics for the predicted time series. Other subjects of interest include the role of
characteristics and revisions of "actual" data in the evaluation of the forecasts; differences
by subperiod, roughly the 1970s vs. the 1980s; the relationship between the individual and

group mean or "consensus" forecasts from the surveys; the comparative accuracy of the
survey results and predictions with a well-known macroeconometric model; and comparisons

with forecasts from state-of-the-art multivariate and univariate time series models.

Part 2 of this paper examines some general problems and history of forecast
evaluations and surveys. Part 3 presents the NBER-ASA data and the methods used. Parts

4 through 7 discuss the results of the analysis and form the core of the paper. Part 8 draws
the conclusions.

2. The Diversity of Forecasts and Their Evaluation
2.1 Some Reflections on Predictability and Uncertainty
It is readily observed that, at any time, predictions of a given variable or event can and

in general do differ significantly across forecasters.

Indeed, modern macroeconomic

5

forecasts display a great diversity, which must be taken into account in thinking about how
to assemble and evaluate the related data.

Although changes in the economy are predicted primarily to meet the demand for
forecasts by public and private decision makers, they are also predicted to test theories and

analytical methods and to argue for or against points of policy. Some conditions and
aspects of the economy are much more amenable to prediction than others. Furthermore,

individual forecasters differ with respect to skills, training, experience, and the espoused
theories and ideologies. They compete by trying to improve and differentiate their models,
methods, and products. They respond to new developments in the economy and new ways

to observe and analyze them. In sum, there are both general and specific reasons for the
observed diversity of forecasts.

Comparisons among forecasts that are differentiated in several respects are difficult

yet unavoidable. The quality of a forecast is inherently a relative concept. Common
standards of predictive performance must therefore be applied to properly classified
forecasts along each of the relevant dimension.
Surely, the main value of a forecast lies in its ability to reduce the uncertainty about

the future faced by the user. In general, a forecast will perform better in this regard the
smaller and closer to randomness its errors are. However, the value of a forecast depends
not only on its accuracy and unbiasedness but also on the predictability of the variable or
event concerned. Some events and configurations of values are common, others are rare.

6

Where the probability of occurrence for the forecasting target is high, uncertainty is low and

prediction is easy hut not very informative; where that probability is low, uncertainty is high

and prediction is difficult but potentially very valuable (ci. Theil 1967).

For example, total stocks of the nation's wealth and productive capital normally
change little from one month or quarter to the next, barring a catastrophic war or a natural

disaster, and so can be predicted with small relative errors. Much the same applies to

other typically "slow" stock variables such as total inventories of goods or monetary
aggregates and the overall price level (but not in periods of rapid inflation!). In contrast,
income and expenditure aggregates represent "fast" flow variables, some of which, e.g.,
corporate profits, investment in plant and equipment, housing starts, and change in business

inventories are highly volatile over the short horizons and apt to be very difficult to forecast

accurately. Rates of change in indexes of price levels fall in the same category.

There are also situations that are unique or nearly so where no objective or
subjective probabilities based on past history or experience are believed to apply and 'true"

(nonergodic) uncertainty rules (as in Knight 1921, p. 233). According to Keynes (1936, p.
149), "Our knowledge of the factors which will govern the yield of an investment some years

hence is usually very slight and often negligible," yet businessmen must make decisions to
make or buy plant and equipment despite this recognized state of ignorance. In economics,

as in history, statistical-stochastic methods have limited applicability (cf. Hicks 1979; Solow
1985). Forecasters cannot afford to be deterred by such considerations and assume some

7

predictability throughout, never full uncertainty.

Across many variables, uncertainty

depends on the "state of nature" (more explicitly, on the state of the econoniy or the phase

of the business cycle). Thus, it is much easier to predict continued moderate growth once
it is clear that the economy entered a period of sustained expansion than it is to predict the

occurrence and timing of a general downturn after the expansion has tasted for some time
and may be slowing down.
Influential public macroforecasts could in principle be either self-invalidating or self-

validating. Thus, if the government believed a forecast of a recession next year, it might
succeed in stimulating the economy so as to make the expansion continue. On the other
hand, if consumers generally came to expect a recession because of such a forecast, they
may each try to protect themselves by spending less nowand dissaving later when the bad

times arrive.

Businessmen, acting on similar expectations, may reduce investment

expenditures and financing, production, and inventory costs. But such actions, although
individually rational, would collectively help bring about the recession no one wants.
Indeed, an early theoretical monograph on forecasts of general business conditions

concluded, on these grounds, that they cannot be accurate, particularly if they are made
public (Morgenstern 1928). However, it is not necessarily true that a known forecast must
be falsified by agents' reaction to it, even if that reaction does affect the course of events.

Conceptually, the reaction can be known and taken into account for bounded variables
related by continuous functions (Grunherg and Modigliani 1954).' But the public prediction

8

can he correct only if the corresponding private prediction is correct, which of course is

often not the case. Forecasting remains difficult whether or not its results are published.
The premise of a generally shared belief and confidence in a commonly held forecast is so

unrealistic as to deprive the theoretical exercises based on it of much practical interest.

2.2 A Brief History of Forecast Appraisals and Su'eys
Qualitative judgments about contemporary levels of, and changes in, general business

activity are among the oldest economic data. A compilation of such records provided
partial evidence for the NBER work on identi'ing and dating the business cycles of history
(Thorp 1926; Burns and Mitchell 1946). A look at these "business annals" that go back to
the 1830s reminds one of the importance of public perceptions and expectations concerning

aspects of the general economic and financial activity: employment, production, prices,
interest rates.

This expectational element in the dynamics of economic life has probably long
attracted great attention of students of current events and men of affairs.
It has not much concerned those early theorists who have been preoccupied with problems

of long-run static equilibrium. But some prominent economists in the classical tradition
stressed the role in business cycles of variations in expectations and "confidence" (Marshall),

or hypothesized the occurrence of sequences of overoptimism and overpessimism (Pigou),

or attributed to bankers and entrepreneurs predictive errors resulting in malinvestments

9
(Hayek). Keynes and some of his later followers elaborated on the destabilizing role of
uncertainty. Along with the formal models of interacting economic processes came the

theories of expectation formation, first that of adaptive and later that of rational
expectations. In the last twenty years or so, incomplete information and expectational

errors acquired prime importance in models of economists of various persuasions
(monetarist, new-classical, new-Keynesian). The corresponding literature grew rapidly.

Lack of quantitative data has long hampered the progress of economics, causing
empirical work and tests to lag well behind the formulation of theories and hypotheses.
Numerical data on forecasts and expectations are particularly scarce, except for the very

recent period of great expansion in economic and financial prediction and consulting
activities. Hence, the literature on macroeconomic forecasting has a brief history, although
it too grew rapidly of late.2

The first forecasting services in the United States to gain considerable success date

back to the years immediately preceding World War I and the 1920s. They used lead-lag
relationships to predict business cycle turning points, relying mainly on the tendency of

stock prices to lead and short-term interest rates to lag business activity. The sequence,

best-known as the Harvard "ABC" curves, had a basis in theory and fact but it was a
crudely oversimplified predecessor of the indicator system subsequently developed at the

NBER. It performed rather well in the period 1903-14 and in the depression of 1920-2 1,

and it would have applied generally in recent times as well (cf. Moore 1969), but the

10

Harvard service failed to foresee the onset and extent of the Great Depression, which

doomed this and the related forecasting efforts. A 1988 post-mortem study, using the
Harvard data and modern vector autoregressive (VAR) model techniques, concludes that
the large declines in output that followed the 1929 stock market crash were not forecastable

(Dominguez, Fair, and Shapiro 1988). This, however, is disputed by a very recent paper
that applies the Neftci sequential-analysis method to the Harvard index (Niemira and Klein
1991).

Monthly forecasts from six sources, 1918-28, were scored for accuracy in Cox 1929,

to our knowledge the first methodical appraisal of ex ante predictions of U.S. business
activity. Cox found evidence of a moderate forecasting success despite the poor showing
at the 1923-24 recession.

The earliest compilation of quantitative macro-forecasts, so far as we can tell, was
the informal survey conducted since 1947 by Joseph Livingston, the late syndicated financial

columnist based in Philadelphia. Twice a year he collected predictions of such variables

as industrial production and the consumer price index and summarized the results in a
business outlook column published in June and December. The forecasters were mostly
business and financial economists but also some academics. The Livingston data represent

a unique source of valuable information on forecasts for the early post-World War II
period, and in the 1970s they began to be widely used in research, primarily on price
expectations. But Livingston adjusted his published "consensus forecasts" (means of the

11

collected individual predictions) in an attempt to take into account any large revisions in
the actual data that may have occurred between the mailing of his questionnaire and the
submission of his column to the press. arlson 1977 recalculated the semiannual Livingston
forecasts of CPI and WPI inflation rates for 1947-75 from the original data so as to reflect

properly the timing of the predictions and the information incorporated in them.4
As quantitative macroeconomic data and forecasts began to accumulate in the 1950s

and 1960s, valid examinations of the accuracy and properties of the latter became

increasingly possible (Okun 1959; Theil 1961, 1966; Suits 1962, Stekler 1968). A
comprehensive NBER study initiated in 1963 resulted iii a systematic collection and
appraisal of annual and quarterly, public and private, judgmental and econometric forecasts

of important economic aggregates and indexes as well as such events as business cycle
peaks and troughs (Zarnowitz 1967, 1972; Fels and Hinshaw 1968; Mincer 1969; Moore
1969; Cole 1969; Evans, Haitovsky, and Treyz 1972; Haitovsky, Treyz, and Su 1974).
In 1968, a regular quarterly survey of general economic forecasts was established at

the initiative of Geoffrey Moore, then president of ASA, to be conducted co-operatively by

the NBER and the Business and Economic Statistics Section of the ASA.5 This was the
first major organized effort to build up reliable information about the potential and
limitations of short-term aggregative economic forecasts, which would provide a broad base

for research and improvements in this field. The ASA has "agreed to carry out the surveys
for a period long enough to assure accumulation of useful experience and evidence," while

12

the National Bureau "has assumed responsibility for the tabulation of forecasts, computation

of error statistics and other measures, and research in evaluating the results and their
analytical implications" (Zarnowitz 1968, pp. 1-2). The co-operation was to last 22 years.

One measure of its success is that in 1990 the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
undertook to continue the survey essentially in the same way as it was conducted by the

NBER and the ASA.

3. The NBER-ASA Survey; Characteristics. Measures. and Data
3.1 Coverage

Table 1 identifies each of the variables covered by title, source, symbol, the
Commerce series number, and the form in which we use the data. in the period 1968:41981:2 (column 5), direct forecasts were made for seven nominal indicators and three real

indicators; also, predictions for GNP in constant dollars were derived from those for GNP

in current dollars and the implicit price deflator. In the period 1981:3-1990:1 (column 6),

direct forecasts were made for six nominal and eleven real variables. Seven major
expenditure components of real GNP, the consumer price index, Treasury bill rate, and
corporate bond yield were added to the list; four nominal series (expenditures for consumer

durables, plant and equipment, and national defense, and change in business inventories)

were dropped.

13

The change in 1981 resulted from new initiatives taken by the NBER in the
preceding year. A special questionnaire mailed to a long list of professional forecasters

(both the past and present survey participants and others) collected much useful
information about the reactions to the design and uses of the NBER-ASA survey, the
improvements suggested, and the assumptions and procedures favored. There was strong

sentiment for expanding the survey by including several additional variables. The problem

was how to comply with these wishes without either losing the essential continuity or
overloading the survey and risking discouragement of future participations. An advisory
committee helped make the desirable changes.6

A large number of individuals participated in the earliest surveys but many were not

prepared to fill out a detailed questionnaire each quarter and soon dropped out. Of the
more than 150 persons who responded to the survey at one time or another, many had

sporadic records and some submitted incomplete questionnaires. To exclude such
occasional forecasters, we decided to use only

the responses of those who answered at least 10 surveys, providing information for most

variables and horizons. Note that the surveys need not be consecutive; had we required
long records of uninterrupted participation, few respondents would have qualified.
Table 2 shows how this selection was accomplished and with what results. Using the

forecasts of spending on consumer durables for 1968-81, the number of respondents fell

from a total of 156 to 86 in the sample, but the average number of surveys covered per

14

respondent was greatly increased (e.g., doubled from 11 to 22 according to the medians).

The average number of respondents per survey was reduced but slightly, remaining above
40. The variability of coverage over time was lowered considerably throughout (cf. columns

I and 2).
The participation rates in the surveys were much smaller in 1981-90 than in 1968-81.

In terms of the forecasts of real nonresidential investment, the number of respondents fell

from a total of 74 to 29 in the sample. Again, however, the selection process achieved
relatively good results. The retained forecasters averaged about 20 surveys, more than
double the number for all survey participants. The median number of surveys covered per

respondent declined just from 21 to 18. Here too the relevant dispersion measures were
all substantially reduced (cf. columns 3 and 4).

Finally, the sample for the total period 1968-90, based on forecasts of the
unemployment rate, consists of 111 out of a total of 159 persons. The coverage of surveys
per respondent ranges from 10 to 70, with a mean of about 28; the corresponding figures
for respondents per survey are 12-67 and 37. Here the dispersion statistics show relatively
small declines in the transition from all" to "sample" (cf. columns 5 and 6). All in all, the

turnover among the survey participants was considerable, which should be remembered
when looking at the results of our study.7

15

3.2 Forecasters' Affiliations and Methods

In 1968-80 the questionnaire asked the participating forecasters about their primary

affiliation but later the question was dropped. As illustrated in table 3, academic
economists represented on average about 7 percent and government economists about 8
percent of the membership (lines 5 and 6). All other respondents, except for a few from

labor unions and trade associations, came from the business world. Manufacturing
accounted most of the time for at least one third and up to 40% of the participants;
commercial banking and other financial institutions for one fifth or more; consulting and
research firms also for 20% or more in 1975-80,

less

in earlier years (lines 1-4).

These distributions resemble those for the universe of business forecasters as
represented by the respondents to the annual economic outlook surveys of the National
Association of Business Economists in 1975-89. Here from one third to more than 40%
of respondents were in the industrial economy (manufacturing, energy, utilities), 25-30% in

finance, 12% or more in consulting and research, 4% in other private services, and 6-12%

in government and academia. The assessments of some of the NABE surveys looked for

but found no systematic differences in forecasting performance between these industry
groups.8

Another question asked regularly through 1981 concerned the relative importance

the survey participants assigned to each of several items on a short list of forecasting
methods or tools. Business economists use a variety of procedures to predict the major

16

expenditure components of GNP, combine these predictions in nominal and teal terms, and

check and adjust the resulting forecasts for consistency with logic, theory, and the currently

available information. This "informal GNP model' is an eclectic and flexible approach with

large elements of judgment (Butler and Kavesh 1974). Over 70% of the NBER-ASA
survey respondents reported using it and over 50% on average ranked it first (table 4,

column 1). About one-fifth of the group favored econometric models, whether own or
outside, and one-fourth had their own econometric models (not necessarily comprehensive

and first-ranked). Users of outside models accounted for more than 40% of the early
members and more than half of those in the late 1970s and early 1980s (columns 2 and 3).
Leading indicators were employed by about 70% of the survey membership in 1968-

70 but later that share declined closer to 50%. They were ranked second by most
respondents. Similar majorities referred to anticipations surveys, which generally were given

lower ranks. Other methods, such as time-series models, were specified by fewer than 20%

of the participants and preferred by about half of them (columns 4-6).
These findings leave no doubt about one point, namely that the listed methods were

predominantly used in various combinations. Very few individuals preferred any one of
them so as to exclude the others. Presumably there is a good reason for this in that the
different methods tend to complement each other. For example, new reading on monthly
cyclical indicators and the latest results from an investment or consumer anticipations survey

may be used to modify forecasts from econometric models or the informal approach.

17

There seems to be little or no systematic relation between the forecasters' rankings

of the methods and the accuracy of their predictions, allowing for the difference between
the targeted variables, spans, etc. This is suggested by cross-sectional (survey by survey)

regressions of individual forecast errors on dummy variables representing the first-ranked

methods as well as by comparisons of properly standardized average errors over time
(Zarnowitz 1971; Su and Su 1975). The lower panel in table 4 (lines 5-8) presents average

root mean square errors (RMSEs) for groups classified by their self-declared
methodological preferences. These measures are based on a large number of individual
forecasts of rates of change in nominal and real GNP, IPD inflation, and the levels of the
unemployment rate; they omit occasional forecasters and aggregate across predictions for

the current quarter and three quarters ahead. The differences between the RMSEs are
generally small and of uncertain significance.9

3.3 Basic Measures of Error in Forecasts of Changes and Levels

For series with upward trends, e.g., GNP in current and constant dollars and the
implicit price deflator, the most relevant forecasts are those of percentage change. Let the

current survey quarter and the four quarters that follow be denoted by t = 1,...,5,
respectively. The most recent quarter for which data are available precedes the date of the

survey (t = 0). Then the predicted average changes refer to 0-1, 0-2, ... 0-5, and the
implied marginal (or intraforecast) changes refer to 0-1, 1-2, ... 4-5.

18

For approximately stationary series such as the unemployment rate, real inventory

investment, and real net exports, the most relevant forecasts are those of levels in the
original units. They refer to quarters 1,...,5.
Our data consist of more than 17,000 individual time series of forecasts defined by
source, variable, and horizon. For example, for 1968-90, there are 111 respondents in our
sample, reporting on seven variables over five spans each, which yields 3,885 series (

111

x 7 x 5; but consideration of four marginal changes for five of these variables adds another
subset of 2,220 series). The tables below record the distributions of thesummary measures

of error across these individual series for each variable, period, and horizon covered. We

distinguish three measures - the mean error (ME), the mean absolute error (MAE), and
the root mean square error (RMSE)— and compute for each several location and dispersion
statistics.

These include means, standard deviations, medians, interquartile ranges,

skewness, and kurtosjs (denoted by M, SD, MD, bR, SK, and KU, respectively). Not all

the detail of this compilation can be presented here, of course, but it is available for
purposes of verification and further research.

3.4 Data Revisions and Forecast Accuracy
Some of the variables covered by the surveys, such as the consumer price index and

the interest rates, are subject to few or no revisions. Others, notably the aggregates and

indexes taken from the national income and product (NIPA) accounts, are revised

19

frequently and some of the revisions are large. An old but still controversial issue is which
revision or vintage of such data should be used in evaluating the accuracy of forecasts. The
preliminaiy figures are most closely related to the latest figures that were available to the

forecasters, but they may themselves be partly predictions or °guesstimates" and may
seriously deviate from "the truth" as represented by the last revision of the data. On the

other hand, the final data may be issued years after the forecast was made and may
incorporate major benchmark revisions. That the forecasters should he responsible for
predicting all measurement errors to be corrected by such revisions, is surely questionable.

Appraisals of forecasts differ: some are based on early data (e.g., Zarnowitz 1967),
others on late data, generally pre-benchmark revisions (e.g., McNees 1979; Zarnowitz 1985).

Judgmental forecasts that rely heavily on recent preliminaiy figures may look best when

compared with early data; econometric model forecasts that incorporate long series of
revised data may be more favored by evaluations using later vintages.
Table 5 shows, for the NBER-ASA percentage change forecasts of GNP, RGNP, and

IPD, the MAEs and RMSEs obtained by comparisons with 15-day, 45-day, early July, and
late July data. In general, the errors tend to increase monotonically the more revised the
data are, but there are exceptions. However, the differences between the successive error

measures in each segment and column of the table are relatively small, typically less than
1/10 of one percent. This is fortunate because it suggests that the choice of which vintage

of the data to use may not be so critical. But larger differences may occur in particular

20

suhperiods and offset each other over the total period covered. Our results certainly do

not detract from the importance of measurement errors in the forecasting Context, which
has been demonstrated to be large (Cole 1969).

To save space and avoid relying on the extremes of either very preliminary or
repeatedly revised data, we shall henceforth use the 45-day estimate in most of our text

references and all of our tabular presentation. But no single data vintage is an optimal
standard here; the choice of any is inevitably more or less arbitrary and too restrictive.

4. Forecasts of Nominal and Real GNP Growth and Inflation
4.1 Graphical Comparisons of Predictions

A convenient way to relate visually the distributions of survey forecasts and the
actual data is to plot the former in form of box diagrams and the latter as a Continuous
series, quarter by quarter, to common scales. Charts 1-3 apply this device to predictions

of nominal and real GNP growth and JPD inflation rates. There is one graph for each
variable and horizon. The midpoint of each box marks the location of thegroup's mean

forecast, the top and bottom mark the mean one standard deviation. A longer vertical
line bisects each box and connects the highest and the lowest forecasts recorded on the
same occasion. A heavy curve superimposed upon the array of the boxes and vertical lines
represents the actual outcomes (45-day estimates).

21

The graphs make it clear that the curves cross most of the boxes. This means that

the realizations fall within I SD of the mean or 'consensus' predictions most of the time.
However, some large declines in actual values are widely missed or underestimated, which
shows up as boxes lying conspicuously above the troughs or valleys in the curves. Similarly,
widespread underpredictions of some large actual rises show up as boxes situated below the

local peaks for concentrations of high values. Occasionally, the actual would even he
missed by all respondents to the survey, as seen in instances where the entire vertical line

of forecasts lies above or below the curve.
These errors are clearly associated with business cycles. Chart I shows clusters of

large overestimates of real GNP growth in all major slowdowns and recessions covered:
1969-70, 1973-74, 1981-82, and 1985-86.

It also shows clusters of large underestimation

errors in all recoveries and booms: 1972, 1975, late 1980, 1983-84, and 1987. So
overprediction of growth occurs mainly when the economy weakens and declines,
underprediction when it strongly rises. Both types of error can be seen as particularly

pronounced and persistent in forecasts with longer spans.

Overall, the errors of

overprediction in bad times tended to be larger than those of underprediction in good
times.

Chart 2 shows that inflation was at times widely underpredicted in 1969-71, even

though it was then fairly stable. In 1973-74, a period of supply shocks and deepening
recession, inflation rose sharply and was greatly underestimated by most survey participants.

22

Here the curves can he seen to rise above most of the boxes and even to peak above the
highest forecasts for the longer horizons. The same tendency to underpredict also prevailed

in 1976-80, though in somewhat weaker form. In this period inflation rose more gradually,
while the economy first expanded vigorously and then, in 1979-80 experienced another oil

shock, a slowdown, and a short recession. In between, during the recovery of 1975-76,

inflation decreased markedly and was mostly overestimated. Another, much longer
disinflation occurred in 1981-85, a phase which followed the shifts to a tight monetary policy

in late 1979 and included the severe 1981-82 recession and then a strong recovery. Here
again most forecasters are observed to overpredict inflation. Finally, in 1986-89 inflation,

which began to drift upward, was generally well predicted most of the time (except in the
mid-quarter of 1987 when it dipped suddenly and was overestimated).

In sum, there is also a cyclical pattern to the errors of inflation forecasts.
Accelerated inflation was associated predominantly with under-prediction, disinflation will
overprediction errors.

Chart 3, which compares the forecast distributions and actual values for nominal
GNP growth rates, shows a broad family resemblance to the corresponding graphs for real

ON? growth in Chart 1. For example, both nominal and real growth tended to be
underpredicted in such boom years as 1972 and 1983 and overpredicted in such recession

years as 1974 and 1981-82. But inflation expectations and their relation to real growth
forecasts are also important here. Predictions of nominal GNP are often helped by inverse

23

correlations between the changes in IPD and RGNP, and the associated offsets between
the forecast errors for the two variables. (This has been noted before, see Zarnowitz 1979,

p. 15.) Thus, in the inflationary recession of 1973-74 associated with the first occurrence
of major supply and oil shocks, real growth was overpredicted and inflation underpredicted.

The reverse combination of too low RGNP and too high IPD forecasts can be observed in

the recoveries of 1974 and 1983-84. However, there are also episodes of positive
correlation, e.g., in 1981-82 both real growth and inflation were overpredicted, which
resulted in nominal growth forecasts that turned out much too high.

4.2 Distributions of Summary Measures of Error
Table 6 presents the statistics on the distributions of the mean errors in the sampled

NBER-ASA survey forecasts of GNP, RGNP, and LPD. For the forecasts of average
changes in GNP, the means are all negative, but the corresponding medians have mixed

signs. The averages for the marginal change errors are predominantly positive. The
dispersion measures (SD and LOR) are very large relative to the averages. Thus, these
statistics (line 1-4) fail to show clearly any dominant under- or overprediction bias. Similar

observations can be made about the real GNP forecasts (lines 7-10).

However,

underestimation errors definitely prevail in the inflation (IPD) forecasts. Here all the
averages, M and MD, are negative, and the relative size of the corresponding SD and IQR
figures is less.

24

The M and MD statistics tend to increase monotonically in absolute value with the
length

of the span, strongly for the forecasts of average change, less so for those of the

marginal change. The SD and IOR statistics tend to be much larger the longer the span
and the more remote the forecast target, for each of the three variables. (Cf. lines 1-4, 710, and 13-16.)

There is evidence that the distributions for GNP and RGNP are skewed to the left

(i.e., SK < 0), with medians larger than the means. For IPD, SK is very small throughout

and M and MD are very close. (Cf. lines, 5, 11, and 17.)
The distributions for GNP and RGNP show large values for kurtosis,indicating the

presence of long thick tails (for the normal distribution, KU = 3). Again, the situation is
very different for JPD where the KU statistics are very low. (Cf. lines 6, 12, and 18).
Tables 7 and 8, each of which has the same format as table 6, show the distribution

statistics for the mean absolute errors and the root mean square errors, respectively. The

RMSQs are, of course, larger than the corresponding MAES, and the statistics in table 8
are generally larger than their counterparts
in table 7 (e.g., they average about 30-60% higher for the GNP measures). Otherwise, the
two sets have very similar characteristics, which can be summed up as follows.

For both the MAES and the RMSQs of the individual forecasts, the means and
medians increase with the span regularly, strongly for the average changes, less so for the

marginal changes. The main reason is that errors cumulate over time,

25

but it is also true that the more distant target quarters are predicted somewhat less
accurately than the near ones. The dispersion statistics SD and IQR also increase as the
forecast horizon lengthens, except for the marginal !PD errors.

SK > 0 everywhere here and the SK statistics are generally large for GNP and
RGNP but small for IPD. Consistently, the MDs tend to be smaller than the MEs. The
distributions tend to be skewed to the right.

Several of the KU statistics for GNP and RGNP are quite large. Little kurtosis is
observed in the IPD forecasts, except for the shortest ones.
We conclude that the survey respondents tended to underestimate inflation but not

(or in any event much less) the nominal and real GNP growth rates. The IPD forecast
distributions were more nearly symmetrical and had fewer outliers than the distributions for

GNP and RGNP.

4.3 Individual vs. Group Mean Forecasts
Combining corresponding forecasts that come from different sources or use different

techniques tends to produce significant gains in accuracy. This is by now well known from

many studies, including some based on the NBER-ASA surveys.'0 In what follows we
extend and update the evidence on this point.
Averaging all predictions in each survey for a given variable and horizon results in

a time series of group mean (or median) forecasts. These are often called "consensus"
forecasts, whether or not there is much actual consensus among the respondents. The

group mean predictions based on our GNP, RGNP, and IPD sample forecasts have

26

considerably smaller errors than the average individual respondent, as shown by
comparisons of the ME, MEA, and RMSE entries in Table 9 (ci. columns I and 4, 2 and
5, and 3 and 6). The absolute or squared errors tend to increase with thespan of forecast

for both individuals and group means, but less so for the latter.

For each individual time series of forecasts, a series of group mean forecasts has
been computed with a strictly matching coverage in terms of the survey dates and target
characteristics. Table 10 shows the locational statistics for the distributions of the ratios of

the individual RMSEs to the corresponding group RMSEs. These measures indicate that
the group mean forecasts were more accurate than about 75% of the sampled respondents'

forecasts. Thus, most of the first or lower quartile (Q) ratios are close to one (but some
for RGNP are lower); most of the median (02) ratios are 1.1-1.2; and most of the third or
upper quartile (Q3) ratios are 1.3-1.5 (cf. lines 2-4, 7-9, and 12-14). These distributions are

bounded from below (any ratio > 0) and are heavily skewed to the right (e.g., the entries
for the best forecasts in Table 10 are 0.5-0.9, those for the worst forecasts are 3-7).

The ratios of the individual to the group RMSES, unlike their numerators and
denominators, do not depend systematically on the length of the forecast or distance to the

target quarter. Also, the diversity of the individual forecasts by source, variable, and
horizon is greatly reduced by the normalization with the group means. Thus, the ratios for

the same quartiles are not very different for GNP, RGNP, and IPD.

27

4.4

Some Overall Accuracy and Variability Measures

The preceding tables offer some insight into the structure of errors calculated from
the survey forecasts but not into their relative levels. The latter will he assessed by
comparisons with benchmark predictions from time-series models selected to fit the
characteristics of the variables concerned and with forecasts from other sources. But first

we take a quick look at the average values of the outcomes for the target series so as to
gain some idea about the orders of magnitudes involved.
Columns 7-9 in table 9 show, successively, the means, standard deviations, and root

mean squares of the actual percent changes in the targeted variables. The absolute values

of the average errors in the individual forecasts and, a fortiori, in the group mean forecasts

are generally very small compared with the average actual changes, particularly for GNP
and IPD (cf. columns 1 and 7). The average RMSES of the individual forecasts are about

30-37% of the RMSVs for the nominal GNP growth and inflation and 68-72% of the
RMSVs for the real GNP growth rates (cf. columns 3 and 9). The RMSEs of the group
mean forecasts are about 23-29% of the RMSVs for the nominal GNP growth and inflation

and 5 1-53% of the RMSVs for real GNP growth (cf. columns 6 and 9).

4.5 Have Any Forecasters Exceled Consistently?

Each forecaster in our sample of 111 was ranked by accuracy of his or her
predictions, separately for each forecast target as defined by the date of the survey (t),

28
variable, and span (e.g. for the GNP 0-1 predictions made in 1970:1). Let

of the i-th respondent in the time

t

be the rank

survey, which increases from the smallest to the

largest squared error. The number of surveys covered per respondent (m3 varied widely
across the individuals, and the number of respondents per survey (n1) varied widely across

time (see table 2, column 6). In view of this variability, it was necessary to normalize the
ranks by the number of participants in the particular survey. This is done by calculating
R, = lOOrd/nI. The best forecast in each set would have r11 = 1 and hence

= 100/n1; the worst forecast would have r, = n1 and hence R1

100. This setup

permits us to consider the question: How stable were the accuracy rankings of the
forecasters over time?

When the ranks are aggregated across the corresponding sets for each individual,
measures of central tendency and dispersion are obtained that characterize the distributions

over time of the ranks. Thus, for a given variable and span, the overall rank of the i-tb

forecaster is R.

1/rn R., and the corresponding standard deviation equals

fl/2.

-RJ

[1/rn

We compute such means, SDs, medians, quartiles, and ranges for

each of the 111 individuals covered. Table 11 presents simple averages of some of these

measures in columns 1-4. For example, the grand mean (M) in column 1 represent
= 1/111

I

R..
I

In addition, columns 5-10 in Table 11 summarize the distributions across

29

individuals of the mean normalized ranks R.. The selected statistics include SD,
quartiles, and extremes. For example, here SD = [1/111

(R - )2 )•12(column 5).

The entries in column I are all very close: 53-55 for GNP, 52 for RGNP, 54-59 for

IPD. The corresponding medians (not shown) are similarly clustered but 1-2 points larger.
En fact, there is very little variation between the entries in any column of table 11. That

is, the distributions of the normalized ranks are very similar for any of three variables
covered, and for any of the five spans.

Typically, any forecaster would rank high at some times and low at others. Indeed,
the average range of 85-90 (column 4) is close to the maximum range possible for the R1

ranks (which cannot exceed 99 and would not be much larger than 90 for relatively small

values of ne). The forecaster's rank would fall in the center half of the distribution (i.e.,

in the interquartile range IQR) nearly 50% of the time, and within SD of the mean
perhaps up to 66% of the time (columns 2 and 3). There is no evidence of a high
skewness or a high kurtosis in these distributions. To sum up, the forecasting performance

of any individual relative to others is likely to be highly variable over time.
On the other hand, the dispersion of the corresponding forecasts and their errors

across the individuals will tend to be limited by the commonality of the targets of the
forecasters, and of the information and methods available to them. The correlations
between the forecasters' errors are expected to be positive and may be high. Our measures

presumably reflect all these regularities. Interestingly, the standard deviations in column
2, are 26-28, those in column 5 are only 9-12 (note that the definition of the former

30

includes time t explicitly, while the definition of the latter does not). Similarly, the IQRs
in column 3 are 45-50, those implied by columns 7 and 9 are 9-15; and the corresponding
total ranges are 85-90 and 30-59 (cf. columns 4 and 6-10). These numbers seem consistent

with the results obtained in some previous studies indicating that fluctuations over time
contribute more than differences across forecasters to the overall variation in forecast errors
(see Zarnowitz 1974, pp. 578-79).

For each of the forecast targets identified in lines 1-15 of table 11, the ranks
according to R1 form a relatively tight cluster between the values of Q1 and 03 that
average 47 and 59, respectively (columns 7-9). A quarter of the group performed poorly
relatively to the others, with R values ranging from well above 60 to 100 (columns 9-10).

However, our attention centers on the top-ranking quarter, with R values averaging in
the 30s and 40s (columns 6-7). The latter can be said to have exceled with respect to the
given categoiy of forecast targets.

All these subsets, of course, consist of individuals who are coded and identifiable.

It is important to ask next what the correlations of the ranks are between the different
variables and spans. For example, do those who predicted best the growth of real GNP
also tend to excel in predicting inflation? Do those who rank high in forecasting over the
shortest horizons also rank high in forecasting over the longer horizons?

Table 12 indicates that the answers to these questions are on the whole positive.
The correlations among our normalized ranks, both across the variables for each span (lines

31
1-3)

and across the spans for each variable (lines 4-13), are all positive and sufficiently high

not to be due to chance. Forecasters who predict relatively well (poorly) any one of these
targets are also likely to predict well (poorly) any of the other targets. Not surprisingly, the

correlations are higher the more closely related are the forecast targets. Thus, they are
higher for ON!' and RGNP than for RGNP and IPD, and higher for successive spans, e.g.,
0-1 and 0-2, than for more distant spans, e.g., 0-1 and 0-5. Similar results have been found

for other variables and periods, and for marginal as well as average change forecasts (cf.
Zarnowitz 1984, pp. 17-19).

4.6 Comparisons with BayesianVector Autoregressive

(BVAR) Forecasts

We use a BVAR model with five variables: RON!', IPD, M2 (broad money supply),

LI (the composite index of leading indicators), and TBR (the three-month Treasury bill
rate). TBR is a level series, the others are series of growth rates. The model is estimated
on quarterly series, each taken with six lags. The data are the presently available ones, i.e.,

they incorporate all revisions, and in this sense the forecasts based on them are cx post.
But the forecasts are generated sequentially, using only the information preceding the date

of the forecast.
Unlike the forecasters who can take advantage of the early information provided by

the monthly and weekly time series released during the survey quarter, the BVAR model
does not draw on any such data. On the other hand, unlike the BVAR model, which is

32

based on the present, revised series, the forecasters work under the disadvantage of having

access only to the latest preliminary data, that is, data that contain measurement errors
which are yet to be eliminated by revisions.

Because the quarterly data for the survey quarter (1) are not known to the
forecasters, our first approach was to impute the same lack of knowledge to our BVAR
model. Here, then, the shortest prediction is for 0-1, the longest prediction is for 0-5. But,

as pointed out by Christopher Sims during the conference, this approach (now called
"variant A") ignores any effects on the survey forecasts of the most recent economic news.

Since the knowledge of the news on balance presumably helps the forecasters, variant A

in this respect handicaps our BVAR, as it would more generally any model based strictly
on quarterly time series only.

For this reason, we also present the results of alternative calculations ("variant B"),

which assume full knowledge of the actual values in quarter 1, or effectively perfect

foresight. Here for 0-1 the error of the BVAR model is identically zero, and no
comparisons with the survey forecasts are available; the shortest prediction is for 1-2. Thus,

the two variants represent contrasting extremes: in A there is no knowledge, in B there is
full knowledge of period I values. Variant B handicaps the real-life forecaster who has only

partial and indirect knowledge of the target variables in the current (survey) quarter.
It follows that the truth about the relative accuracy of the individual forecasts from
the surveys and the BVAR forecasts falls somewhere between variants A and B. Table 13

33

provides the evidence, showing in columns 1-3 that the measures of error of BVAR-A for
spans 0-1, 0-2, ... etc. are approximately equal to the corresponding measures of error of

BVAR-B for spans 0-2 0-3, ..., etc., respectively (compare lines I and 7, 2 and 8, and so

on). As would be expected, the RMSE ratios in columns 4-8 are throughout lower for
variant A than variant B, when comparing entries for the corresponding spans (lines 2 and

7, 3 and 8, and so on). That is, variant B calculations show the BVAR model forecasts in
a relatively more favorable light then variant A calculations do.
We present the results for both variants of the retroactively used time-series models

for comparisons relating to GNP, RGNP, and IPD (this covers both our own and outside,

multivariate and univariate models). For the other variables, only variant A is used. The

"true" outcomes are probably more often than not closer to the variant A than to the
variant B comparisons because (1) the forecasters' information about the recent and current

developments is in fact quite limited and deficient, and (2) the forecasters use preliminaiy
data and the time-series models use revised data. When all is considered, it can be argued

that variant B handicaps the forecasters more than variant A handicaps the models.

The RMSE ratios in table 13, columns 4-8, indicate that at least 75% of the
individual forecasts of GNP, 50% of those of IPD, and 25% of RGNP were more accurate

than the variant A BVAR forecasts. Thus, the 03 ratios are less than 1.0 for nominal
growth and close to 1.0 for inflation. For real growth, the MD ratios approach unity at

spans of 2-3 quarters and exceed it at longer spans. The ratios based on the BVAR

34

forecasts variant B still show most of the survey forecasts to be superior for GNP, but not

for IPD or RON?. Here the ratios rise above 1.00 for all horizons at 03 for ONP, at MD

for IPD, and even at 01 for RGNP.
The BVAR mean errors are all positive, unlike the MEs for the NBER-ASA survey
forecasts which are mostly negative for ON? and IPD, and mostly positive but somewhat

mixed for RGNP. (For this and the rest of the paragraph, see table 13, columns 1-3, and

table 9, columns 1-6.) Comparisons of the MAEs and RMSEs of BVAR with the
corresponding measures for the average individual survey forecast produce a mixed picture,
depending on the series and criteria used. However, the comparisons with the group means

are generally adverse for BVAR of either variant.
Such variables as the leading index and the short-term interest rate act as strong
codeterminants of growth in total output, as suggested by regression estimates and out-ofsample predictions with VAR models (Zarnowitz and Braun 1990; Zarnowitz 1991, chapter

11). Our findings here are consistent with these results. The BVAR forecasts of RGNP
perform relatively well, which holds a potentially useful lesson for the forecasters to take

proper account of these relationships. But the BVAR forecasts of GNP and IPD are
apparently much weaker.

4.7 Comparing Forecasts for the First and Second Halves of 1968-90
The period 1968:4-1979:3 was one of upward drifts and large instability in

35

both inflation and unemployment; of business contractions in 1969-70 and 1973-75; of the
Vietnam war and price control disturbances in the early years, and severe supply (mainly
oil-price) shocks in the middle and late years. The period 1979:4-1990:1 was one of more

successful attempts to slow inflation by restrictive monetary policy; of sharp rises in prices
and interest rates followed by downward trends in the wake of two back-to-back recessions
in 1980 and 1981-82; of a long expansion that followed, interrupted by slowdowns in 1984-

86 and 1989; of new trade and financial problems. It is of interest to ask how the
macroforecasts fared in these two so different periods of approximately equal length.
The errors of the individual forecasts from the NBER-ASA surveys were on average

larger in 1979-90 than in 1968-79 for GNP but smaller for IPD, judging from the
comparisons of the RMSEs in table 14, columns I and 5. For RGNP, the differences

between the two subperiods are small and mixed, depending on the horizon of the
forecasts.

The average individual to group-mean RMSE ratios differ little between 1968-79
(1.04

j/g

1.34) and

1979-90 (1.15 hg

1.31).

They decreased somewhat in the

latter period for short ON? and RON? forecasts, increased more for longer IPD forecasts,
but remained approximately unchanged in most cases (cf. columns 2 and 6).

The individual-to-BVAR RMSE ratios for ON? rose from .6 or less in 1968-79 to

around .8 in 1979-90; those for RON? rose as well, from an approximate range of .6-1.0

to .9-1.2; and those for IPD declined from .9-1.0 to .6-.9 (columns 3 and 7). These i/by

36

ratios, then, show that on average the NBER-ASA survey forecasts outperformed our

BVAR forecasts, except for RGNP in 1979-90. The group mean predictions from the
surveys were throughout more accurate than BVAR, i.e., the ratios g/bv < 1 in all cases
(columns 4 and 8). M might be expected, the changes in i/by and g/bv between the two
subperiods paralleled each other directionally.

There is no evidence here that the forecasts on the whole either improved or
deteriorated in the 1980s as compared with the 1970s. The BVAR benchmark proved a

little more effective in 1979-90 than in 1968-79 for nominal and real GNP growth and
somewhat less effective for inflation.

5. Other Forecasts for 1968-90
5.1 Percent Change Forecasts: Industrial Production and Corporate Profits
Table 15 shows that the average errors of the forecasts of IP and CP tended to be

positive but widely dispersed and strongly increasing with the span (columns 1-3). The
RMSES increased similarly (columns 4-6). Comparisons with the average size and

variability of the actual changes (columns 9-11) indicate a moderate level of accuracy for
the 11' forecasts but poor overall performance for the CP forecasts (where the mean and

median RMSES exceed the actual SD and RMSV values). The large positive values of SK

and KU for the IP predictions up to three quarters ahead suggest skewness to the right and
fat tails; the latter may also characterize the longer CP predictions (columns 7-8).

37

Combining the individual forecasts by simple averaging reduces the errors
substantially for IP (except for the longest span) but not for CP, where the gains from using

the group mean or consensus forecast are small (cf. table 15, columns 4 and 6, with table

16, column 1). Accordingly, the RMSE ratios j/g are smaller for CP than for IP; but it is
still true for both variables that only about the best 25% of the sample are more accurate
than the group mean forecasts (see table 16, columns 2-4).

The BVAR model forecasts (variant A only) outperform the group mean forecasts
for profits. The comparisons for the production index yield closer and mixed results, which

favor the survey group's predictions for the shorter and the BVAR predictions for the
longer horizons. (Cf. the corresponding entries in columns 1-4 and 5-8 of table 16.)
Both IF and CF forecasts had larger RMSEs in 1979-90 than in 1968-79 in almost

all cases (table 17, columns I and 5). Compared with BVAR, variant A, the survey
forecasts look better in the earlier than in the later subperiod, particularly for IP (cf.
columns 3 and 4 with columns 7 and 8, respectively).

5.2 Level Forecasts: Unemployment Rate and Housing Starts
For UR (table 18, lines 1-5), the mean errors are predominantly negative, suggesting

some underprediction, but they also show considerable dispersion. Level errors, unlike
average change errors, do not cumulate, but the RMSES still increase substantially with the

distance to the target quarter. The summary error measures are quite small relative to the

38

statistics for the actual values of UR. For short forecasts, the distributions of the RMSES
are skewed to the right and have fat tails, judging from the large SK and KU values.
For HS (lines 6-10), the mean errors are close to zero and have mixed signs. They
do not depend on the distance to the target (unlike the mean errors for UR, which increase

with the distance). The RMSE and SD values, as usual, increase for the longer forecasts,
but they remain fairly small compared with the measures for the actual values of HS. The

SK and KU figures are small.
Combining the individual forecasts results in substantial gains in accuracy for both
variables but particularly UR (cf. table 19, column 1, and table 18, columns 4 and 6). The

RMSE ratios i/g are generally higher for UR than for HS, but once again the Q1 ratios
are close to one throughout, i.e., about 75% of the individual forecasts are less accurate
than the group means in either case (table 19, columns 2-4). The BVAR forecasts, variant

A, are about as accurate as the group mean forecasts for target quarters 3-5 of both UR
and HS; for closer targets, the comparisons favor the surveys for UR and the BVAR for
HS (ci. the corresponding entries in columns 1-4 and 5-8).

Table 20 shows that the NBER-ASA forecasters on the whole predicted UR
somewhat better, and HS somewhat worse, in 1968-79 than in 1979-90 (cf. columns I and

5). The relative performance of the group mean vs. individual forecasts was very similar
in the two periods (columns 2 and 6); that of the BVAR variant A model improved in most
cases for UR but showed no systematic change for HS (columns 3-7 and 4-8).

6. Comparisons with Selected Econometric and Time-Series Model Forecasts

6.1 The Michigan University Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics

The Michigan RSQE has the longest record of the several well-known service
bureaus working with macroeconometric forecasting models. RSQE kindly provided us with

the record of their forecasts, and we were able to compare them with the NBER-ASA
survey forecasts for ten variables.

It is important to note that the quarterly Michigan

forecasts begin in 1970:4 and were not made in the first quarter in years 1975 and 1976,
and in the second quarter in years 1971-75 and 1977-79." We matched the Michigan and
the NBER-ASA forecasts period by period. Further, the Michigan predictions were made

typically in March, June (occasionally May), August (rarely September), and November (in
1974-75,

December). The NBER-ASA survey questionnaire was usually mailed in the first

half of each quarter but it was only in the last month of the quarter that all responses were
collected. Thus, at least some of the survey forecasts had the advantage of later timing
(which means more potentially useful up-to-date information) vis-a' -vis the Michigan
forecasts.

Comparing the ME, MAE, and RMSE statistics for the Michigan and the NBERASA group mean forecasts shows the latter to have been more accurate for GNP, RGNP,
and IPD (cf. columns 1-3 and 4-6 in table 21). Consistent evidence comes from the RMSE

ratios that have ranges of approximately 0.7-0.9, 0.9-1.1, and 1.0-1.3 for 01, MD, and 03,

respectively (columns 7-9). Thus, generally about half or more of the individual forecasts
from the surveys were at least somewhat more accurate than the Michigan forecasts.

40

The results for the other variables are mixed. As shown in table 22, the Michigan

predictions of real consumption show on the whole larger errors than the NBER-ASA
"consensus," but not by much and not for the longest horizon (lines 1-5). They are better
than 50% of the individual survey forecasts for the two shortest spans, and better than 75%

for the three longest spans. The comparisons for real nonresidential investment favor the

group averages by modest margins, except again for the longest span covered. For real
residential investment, the Michigan forecasts are definitely better than all but the shortest

group mean forecasts. National defense expenditures are predicted better by the surveys

through span 0-3 and better by Michigan for the two longer spans. More than half of the

RMSE ratios j/M for NFL, RFI, and DEF are less than one (lines 6-20).
The pattern that the NBER-ASA group mean forecasts have an edge for the two

shortest spans and the Michigan forecasts for the two longest spans holds for the
unemployment rate and the Treasury bill rate in table 23 (lines 1-5 and 6-10). The middle

span shows about equal RMSEs for the two sets. The corporate bond yield predictions
from Michigan outperform those from the surveys for all but the shortest span (lines 11.15).

6.2 Sims' Probabilistic Forecasts
In addition to outside econometric model forecasts, we wished to compare the results

of the NBER-ASA surveys to outside time-series forecasts. We are indebted to Chris Sims

for data on predictions from both a sophisticated BVAR and univariate ARIMA models.

41

Recall that our own BVAR model used earher in this paper includes RGNP, IPD,

TBR, M2, and LI, plus the variable predicted (if not one of the above). The Sims model
includes the first three variables in our set, plus six others: Ml, UR, NFl, S&P 500 stock

price index, a commodity price index, and the trade-weighted value of the dollar.12 It is a
nine-variable, five-lag model, whereas ours is a five-or-six variable, six-lag model.
Sims model is an extension of the model constructed in 1980 and used in quarterly

forecasting during 1980-86 by Litterman (1986). It is three variables larger than the original

Litterman model and it allows time-variation in coefficients, predictable time variation in
forecast error variance, and non-normality in disturbances (Sims 1989). The modifications

give rise to non-normal, nonlinear models and hence to considerable complications in
estimation and analysis (Sims and Todd 1991). The Sims model (like our own BVAR)
forecasts are simulations of real-time forecasts in that they use only data from time periods

before the periods to be predicted. But for several reasons, including the use of current
versions of the data, they are far from being true ex ante forecasts (again, the same applies

to our BVAR as well).

In evaluating the BVAR forecasts (both Sims' and our own), we used the current
data, which is consistent with their construction and believed to be fair. Use of preliminary
figures would have resulted in finding larger errors.
Again, like for our own BVAR

(see table 13 and text above), the comparisons of

Sims model forecast with the NBER-ASA survey forecasts for GNP,

RGNP, and IPD are

42

presented in two variants A and B (table 24). For reasons already explained, variant A

favors the real-time predictions that incorporate contemporary news evaluations, while
variant B favors the predictions based on the ex post constructed time-series models.

Using variant A, Sims' forecasts (S) are found to have on the whole larger errors

than the group mean forecasts from the NBER-ASA surveys for both ON? and RGNP

(table 24, lines 1-5 and 11-15, cf. columns 1-3 and 4-6). The corresponding ratios
RMSEJRMSES are relatively low, approaching 1.00 only for 03 (columns 7-9), which means
that most individual forecasts from the surveys are more accurate than the S forecasts. In
contrast, the S forecasts are considerably more accurate than the group mean forecasts for

IPD inflation, and here the RMSE ratios i/S mostly exceed 1.00, even for Q (lines 21-25).
Using variant B as a criterion (lines 6-10, 16-20, and 26-30), we still see the group
mean forecasts as retaining on balance an advantage over the S forecasts for ON?, but it
is a much reduced advantage and one essentially limited to the longer spans. For RGNP,

the NBER-ASA consensus predictions are somewhat more accurate than the S model
predictions for the spans 0-4 and 0-5, whereas the opposite is true for the shorter spans.

For IPD, the S forecasts have smaller errors throughout. (Cf. columns 1-3 for variant B
with the corresponding entries in columns 4-6.) Looking at the RMSE ratios, i/S (columns

7-9), we find them to exceed 1.00, that is, to favor the S model, for GNP at 03 only, for

RGNP at MD and Q3 and for IPD at 01, MD, and 03.

43

Interestingly, the original Litterman BVAR performed relatively well for real GNP
and unemployment hut worse for IPD, which motivated both Litterman and Sims to make
changes designed to improve their inflation forecasts. But simulations disclosed "a tendency

for improvements in the retrospective forecast performance of the BVAR model for
inflation to be accompanied by deterioration in its performance for real variables' (Sims
1989, p. 1). A similar tradeoff was observed in the work with our own BVAR.

According to the measures in table 25 (based on the variant A only), most of the
NBER-ASA survey forecasts for the unemployment rate (1968-90), the Treasury bill rate
(1981-90), and the rate of growth in real nonresidential fixed investment (1981-90) exceeded

the corresponding Sims model forecasts considerably in overall accuracy. This can be
concluded from both the comparisons with group mean predictions from the surveys (cf.
columns 1-3 and 4-6) and the low i/S ratios (columns 7-9).
The Sims model and our own BVAR forecasts have errors of generally similar order

of magnitude. The Sims predictions are more accurate for GNP and IPD, less accurate for
RGNP and UR. The results for NFl and TBR are mixed (favoring Sims at the two longest
horizons only).13

6.3 linivariate Time-Series Models

Predictions from ARIMA models make popular benchmarks for evaluating
forecasters' performance. We use ARIMAS as specified in Sims and Todd 1991, where

44

they are reported to have worked well relative to the Simsian BVAR for financial variables
and business fixed investment in 1980-90 (pp. 9-10). However, our measures show that the

BVAR forecasts by Sims had throughout smaller overall errors than the corresponding

ARIMA forecasts, whether the comparisons cover the variants A or the variants B (cf.

Table 24 and 25, columns 1-3, with Tables 26 and 27, columns 2-4).
The results of comparing the NBER-ASA survey forecasts with their counterparts
of the Sims-Todd ARIMA type are less clear-cut. Most of the forecasters did better than

the time-series models according to the variant A calculations, as is evident from the
individual-to-ARIMA (i/A) ratios in columns 5-7 of Tables 26 and 27. But when variant
B is used, the forecasters are no longer clearly ahead for RGNP and fall somewhat behind

for IPD (Table 26, lines 16-20 and 26-30).

Beginning in 1976:2, Charles Nelson has produced ARIMA forecasts of rates of
change in nominal and real GNP and the implicit price deflator synchronously with other

real-time forecasts, updating them each quarter upon the announcement of the first
preliminary numbers for the preceding quarter. Comparisons with five econometric models

for the period 1976:2-1982:4 have shown these ex ante "benchmark" forecasts to be of
competitive accuracy (Nelson 1984). Since 1988, Frederick Joutz has been preparing the

ARIMA forecasts on a current basis (the same way as Nelson had before), and he kindly
let us have the results for the purposes of a comparative analysis.

45

Table 28 shows that the NBER-ASA group mean forecasts (g) were on average
consistently more accurate than the Joutz ARIMA (J) forecasts (cf. columns 2-5 and 3-6).

The RMSE ratios g./J rose with the span from .73 to .88 for GNP and from .76 to .83 for
RGNP; they varied irregularly between .78 and .81 for IPD. The RMSE ratios i/J (columns

7-9) average .8-.9 for 01, 1.0-1.1 for MD, and 1.3-1.5 for 03. Our analysis confirms the

findings that these ARIMA forecasts are indeed competitive, and that their relative
accuracy tends to improve with their horizon for GNP and RGNP (but not for IPD, where
they are weakest).

7. A General Evaluation and Conclusions
In presenting and discussing more than 30 tables on multiperiod quarterly forecasts
for a score of variables by a total of more than 100 individuals, we had to make some hard

choices about which problems to confront and which measures to use. Forecasts for two-

thirds of the time series covered were treated less comprehensively and relegated to an
appendix, to make the paper easier to read. Even so, the inevitable abundance of detail

risks obscuring the overall picture. Therefore, lest we miss the forest for the trees, a
statement of general findings, conclusions, and qualifications is very necessary at this point.

1. The distributions of the error statistics show that there is much dispersion across

the forecasts, which typically increases with the length of the predictive horizon.
Forecasters differ in many respects and so do their products. The idea that a close

46

"consensus" persists, i.e., that current matched forecasts are generally all alike, is a popular

fiction. The differentiation of the forecasts usually involves much more than the existence

of just a few outliers. However, it is also true that forecasters depend on common
information, interact, and influence each other. This naturally induces some common

trends. The more independent information the individuals possess, the more their
predictions can differ. Thus, a clustering of forecasts could be due either to genuine
agreement or common ignorance, while dissent may reflect uncertainty.'4

2. Errors of the average change forecasts cumulate over the spans O-1,...,O-5 with
great regularity for a variety of time series. To a large extent, this occurs because of the

progression to larger changes in the corresponding actual values. But the errors of
marginal change and level forecasts, too, often increase with the distance to the target

quarter, although by much smaller margins and with much less regularity. As might be
expected, the further out in the future the target, the less can be inferred about it from the
past and the worse it is usually forecast. The less random and more predictable the series,

the better this rule holds, in the sense that the forecasts will be more forward-looking and

more appropriately differentiated with the distance to the target period.'5

3. Macroeconomic variables differ greatly in forecastability. The more persistent
(autocorrelated) series are, of course, more accurately predicted than series with high

random variability. Thus, real GNP and consumption are far easier to forecast than
residential investment and, especially, change in business inventories.

Inflation was

47

underestimated and poorly predicted by most forecasters most of the time. Negative

correlations between RGNP and IPD forecast errors have long been observed (see

Zarnowitz 1979, table 4 and text), and offsetting performance for inflation and real
variables appears to be frequently encountered in studies of forecasting methods and
results.

4. A comparison of the summary measures of error for 1968:4-1979:3 and 1979:41990:1 reveals no large and systematic differences that would indicate either deterioration
or improvement in the overall performance of the respondents to the NBER-ASA surveys.
The accuracy of GNP forecasts may have decreased somewhat but that of inflation forecasts

increased. The 1970s and the 1980s differed significantly in a number of economically
important dimensions, but it is difficult to say that either subperiod presented the forecasts
with definitely greater problems than the other. Each experienced two business recessions,

which is noted because previous research has shown that turning-point errors played a
major role in downgrading the forecasting records (for a recent summary, see Zarnowitz
1991).

5. Group mean forecasts are generally much more accurate than the majority of
individual forecasts. These consensus predictions are computed by simple averaging across
the corresponding responses to each successive survey; we made no effort to use other than

equal weighting. This paper, then, provides many examples of the rule that combining
forecasts often results in substantial improvements. The method is very accessible and

48

inexpensive. The gains are enhanced by the diversification of the forecasts that are

combined, e.g., our group mean forecasts should be better, the more different and
complementary the information embodied in their components. For some variables and
periods the combinations work much better than for others. In principle, one would prefer

to combine the information in a single model rather than combine the forecasts. In
practice, the latter will typically be much easier.
6. Consider first comparisons with time-series models constructed on the assumption

that the last-known values of the variables concerned refer to the prior quarter t-1 (variant

A). The assumption is certainly valid for the quarterly variables in the real-time forecasts,
but it results in some bias against the time-series forecasts. Table 29 sums up the evidence

in form of the RMSEs averaged across spans. For the subset consisting of the median

individual and the consensus forecasts from the NBER-ASA surveys, the Michigan
econometric model, our BVAR (A) model, the Sims (A) probabilistic model, and the SimsTodd ARIMA (A) model (lines 1-4, 6, and 8), the consensus (group mean) survey forecasts

rank first for GNP and RGNP, and second for IPD (following the Sims (A) model).
7. The alternative assumption, that the last-known values of the variables refer to
the current quarter t (variant B) is rather strongly biased in favor of the ex post forecasts

with time-series models. The ARMSES are all much lower for the variant B predictions
than for their variant A counterparts (cf. lines 4, 6, and 8 wiht lines 5,7, and 9). When all
nine sets of forecasts listed in table 28 are considered, Sims (B) model ranks 2,2, and 1 for

49

GNP, RGNP, and IPD, respectively. The corresponding ranks of BVAR (B) are also high:

3, 1, and 3. The NBER-ASA consensus forecasts are now almost tied for the first rank
with Sims (B) and rank only 3 for RGNP and 5 for IPD (cf. lines 2, 5, and 7).
8. Table 30 sums up the evidence on the comparative accuracy of the several sets
of forecasts included in this study, using the longest series of predictions available for each

variable. Here again, root mean square errors averaged across the spans serve as the basis
for ranking the forecasts, but only the variant (A) time-series predictions are used. By this

criterion, the group forecasts from the NBER-ASA surveys earned 10 first and 10 second
ranks for the 21 variables covered. The median individual forecasts ranked first or second
6 times, third 11 times, and lower four times. Our BVAR model had equal numbers of the

first, second, and third ranks (5 each), plus six lower ranks. The Michigan (RSQE)
forecasts, available for 10 variables, ranked first and second four times and once, third and
fourth three times and twice, respectively. Sims probabilistic model forecasts, available for
six variables, were mostly less accurate, and the AREMA model forecasts were throughout

least accurate.
9. Finally, Table 31, using sums of the ranks across variables, shows that the group

(consensus) forecasts from the survey performed best overall in each of the periods
covered; the Michigan forecasts were second best; the median individual forecasts, BVAR

model forecasts, and the Sims forecasts share mostly the ranks 3 or 4 (there are ties); and

the ARIMAs rank last. Note that major deviations from this ordering appear for some

50

variables, notably Michigan is best for UR, Sims for IF. Also, these results conceal the

differences between the forecast horizons, which are sometimes important (e.g., the
Michigan forecasts would rate higher for the longer, lower for the short, spans).

10. It is important to emphasize that these comparisons concentrate on only one

aspect of the forecasts and need not imply an overall superiority of any of them. For
example, the econometric and time-series models are clearly much better defined, more
explainable, replicable, and internally consistent than the survey forecasts. But the survey

data collectively embody a great deal of apparently useful knowledge and information
available to professional forecasters. An interesting project, which must be left for future
research, would be to identify the best of the individual forecasts from the surveys, and to

combine them with each other and with very different model forecasts. Regressions of
actual values on predictions from different sources and models would serve as one method

for implementing this objective. Given rich data from active forecasters and interesting
models, studies of this type should yield useful lessons.

Interestingly, the Morgenstern and Grunberg-Modigliani papers are in a sense

precursors of the contemporary rational expectations models in which behavior
follows forecasts that are consistent with the assumptions of the models and free

of any systematic errors.

2. The same applies to the literature on microeconomic prediction, which is
additionally restricted by the fact that much of the material on microforecasts
is confidential.
3.

Forecasts of a Yale service developed by Irving Fisher were not better in 1929

than those of the Harvard service developed by Warren Persons (see
Dominguez et al. 1988).
4.

Later studies of the Livingston forecasts generally used them as amended by

Carlson, but many earlier studies suffer from measurement errors in the
published group averages.
5.

The B&E Section had long been engaged in producing annual surveys of
forecasts by its members.

6. The committee was established with the support of the B&E section of the
ASA and its 1980 and 1981 chairmen, Arnold Zellner and George Tiao. The

members included Rosanne Cole, Ray C. Fair, Edgar R. Fiedler, Albert A.

52

Hirsch, F. Thomas Juster, Geoffrey H. Moore, George L Periy, W. Allen

Spivey, and Victor Zarnowitz. For more detail Ofl these initiatives, see
Zarnowitz 1982, pp. 11-13.
7.

Missing observations (gaps in response) limit our ability to use these data to
study such problems as the dependencies over time in the forecast errors (but
see Zarnowitz 1985, section 3).

8. We are indebted to David L Williams, Secretary-Treasurer of the NABE, for
help in collecting the data used in the text paragraph above.
9.

Most of these differences actually disappear when rounded off to one decimal

point. Providing detail by span of forecast and for some other variables would
not alter the picture significantly (see Zarnowitz 1983, pp. 84-85). However, it

is probably worth noting that the group ranking first the outside econometric
models had the smallest average RMSES for most variables (column 3). This
group included large companies using well-known econometric service bureaus

as well as their own staffs of professional economists.
10.

See Zarnowitz 1984, which uses the data for 1968-79. An early demonstration
that simple averaging can reduce forecast errors is in Zarnowitz 1967, pp. 123-

126. For a survey of the literature, see Clemen 1989.

11. RSQE predicts normally eight times in each year.

53

12. The data are generally expressed in log level form, except for TBR which was
not logged.

13. For the RMSEs of the BVAR forecasts, see Table 13, column 3 (GNP, RGNP,
IPD), and Tables 19, A.6, and A.8, column 5 (UR, NFl, and TBR, respectively).

14. Cf. Zarnowitz and Lambros 1987, a study which compares the point and
probabilistic forecasts from the NBER-ASA surveys. Time and space
restrictions

prevented us from including

in

this

paper the survey

responses to questions on the probabilities of alternative GNP and IPD
outcomes and turning points. See also Braun and Yaniv 1991.
15.

it should be noted that annual forecasts are generally more accurate than all
but the veiy short quarterly forecasts, owing to cancellation of errors for the
quarters within the year (Zarnowitz 1979). In this paper, annual forecasts are
not considered.

16. A few deviations from the rule appear in the longest forecasts, apparently due
to outliers and small-sample problems.

NOTE: The basic unit of measurement is the normalized rank RL — lOO(rJn), .,h.re r — rank
of the i—rh forecaster in time t
of predictions for a given variable and span, and ns —
number of forecasters in the same set. The ranks are, assigned according to the squared errors
(P — A)2, fro. the smallest to largest.
The entries in columns 1—4 represent the means of the
summary measures for the distributions of the individu.e1s ranks over time (e.g.. K in column 1

set

refers to R —

Appendix

Appendix: Forecasts of Diverse Macroeconomic Series. 1968—81 and 1981—90

A.l Selected Nominal Aureates. 1968—81
Current—dollar expenditures on durable consumer goods, business plant and

equipment, and national defense (CD, P8, and DEF. respectively> all contribute
strongly to the cyclicall.ty and volatility of quarterly changes in CNP. DEF is
generally treated as an important exogenous variable.
The statistics for mean errors suggest that underestimates prevailed in the

forecasts of CD and FE, overestimates in those of DEF. but there is much
dispersion across the individual respondents here, which increases strongly with

the forecast horizon (Table A.l, columns 1—3). The R1(SE measures show much the

same kind of progression (columns 6—6). The forecast errors generally are at
least smaller than the actual percent changes in CD. P8, and DEF. but often not
by much, as can be seen by comparing the corresponding entries in columns 4—6 and

9—11. Most of the SK and KU values are small, and only a few fot CD and DEF may
be significant (columns 7 and 8).
The gains from averaging across the individual forecasts are modest for CD
and DEF and, perhaps surprisingly, hardly existent for P8 (Table A.2, columns 1—
4).

The RMSE ratios for FE are closely clustered, indicating lack of

differentiation among the forecasts for this variable. One possible reason may
be the availability and influence of the quarterly anticipation series for plant

and equipment outlays.

The RNSEs of our BVAR forecasts are larger than those of the group mean
forecasts for CD, and much larger for DEF. In contrast, BVAR is found to be much

more accurate than the survey averages for P8. Indeed, the RMSE ratios i/by are

relatively very low for CD and DEF, very high for FE throughout. (Compare the

corresponding measures in columns 1—4 and 5—8).
Finally, the NSER—ASA survey questionnaire used through 1981,2 asked for
forecasts of the levels of inventory investment in current dollars (CBI), another

important but highly volatile and hard—to—predict variable.

Table A.3 shows

that the mean errors and root mean square errors for CBI increased markedly with

the span, while the corresponding standard deviation did not (lines 1—5). The
M and MD Statistics for mean errors are all positive here, the RNSE for target
quarter 5 (i.e. .

t+4)

is about equal to the actual RMSV.

Apparently. CBI is another of those rare cases in which combining the

individual survey forecasts is of little help.

The group mean's RMSE is

relatively large, and even the lower quartile i/g ratios are close to one (see

Table A.4, lines 1—5). However, our BVAR model performs somewhat worse still
here (cf. columns 1—4 and 5—8).

A.2 ComDonents of Real CUP. 1981—90
After mid—1981, the survey collected forecasts of the main GUI' expenditure

categories in constant dollars. We start with real inventory investment (RCSI).
to follow up on the preceding. It turns out that the RCBI forecasts for 1981—90,

like the CBI forecasts for 1981—90, have RflSEs that are large relative to the

average actual levels and their variability, especially for the more distant
target quarters (Table A.3, lines 6—10). The average MEs are negative but very

small, the SDs are large and stable. Again, little is gained by averaging the
individual forecasts, but the group mean forecasts do have a distinct advantage

over the gV.R forecasts (Table A.4, lines 6—10).
Similarly, real net exports (NX) were on the whole poorly predicted in the

l980s, as seen from the large relative size of the summary error measures in

Table A.3, lines 11—15. For NX, too, the group mean forecasts do not help much.

but in this case the BVAR forecasts are found to be much more accurate (Table
A.4. Lines 11—15).

One would expect total consumption (PCE). the largest and smoothest
component of real GNF, to be the easiest to predict and in fact best predicted.
A relatively small but smooth and presumably also well predictable series should

be that of state and local government purchases (SLOP).

Federal government

purchases (FOP) are more autonomous and volatile, hence more difficult to
forecast. Residential fixed investment (RFI) is another hard problem for the
forecasters, though for different reasons: it is highly cyclical and an early
leading series (construction lags behind housing permits and starts are short).

nonresidential fixed investment (NFl) has more persistence, more of an upward
trend, and lags at cyclical turning points, which should make it more predictable

than Rn. Also, NFl is anticipated with long leads by new capital appropriations

and contracts and orders for plant and equipment— but these monthly series on
business investment commitments are themselves very volatile.
The evidence on the forecasts of percent changes in PCE, NFl, RFI. FOP, and

SLOP is generally consistent with these priors. Thus, forecasts of growth in PCE

four quarters ahead have errors averaging about half the actual percent change
(Table A.S, lines 1—5). This is not great but fair, and in sharp contrast to the

apparent failure of forecasts of inventory investment (the least predictable of

the components of aggregate demand). The RHSEs of the NFl forecasts are much
smaller than their counterparts for PSI (but the actual percent changes are also
smaller for NFl; cf. the corresponding entries in lines 6—10 an 11—15). The SLOP
forecasts are definitely much more accurate than the FOP forecasts (cf. lines 16—

20 and 21—25).

The forecasts share some characteristics across all the variables. All the

H and MD statistics for mean errors are negative, suggesting a

underprediction errors (columns I and 3).

prevalence

of

The absolute values of these

statistics increase with the span in each case. Indeed, all the summary error
measures, except SK and KU. show such increases, as do the statistics for actual

values,16 The means of the R1'tSEs are generally larger than the medians, and
SK > 0.

The KU statistics are large in some cases, particularly for NFl (short

forecasts) and SLCP.

Combining the individual forecasts into group means reduces the RHSEs for

each variable and span, as can be seen by comparing column 1 in Table A.6 with
column 6 (and a fortiori with column 4) in Table A.5. AC the lower quartile Q1,
the RMSE ratios i/g are close to one throughout; the range of the median ratios

is about l.1'-L3, that

of

the Q3 ratios is 1.2—1.7. The group mean forecasts

perform best (the ratios are highest) for ECE and SLOP. (See Table A.6, columns
2-4).

Our BVAR forecasts have larger RMSEs than the NEER—ASA group mean forecasts
80 percent of the time, according to the

paired

entries in columns 1 and 5 of

Table A.6. They are very poor for PCE and definitely inferior for FOP, whereas
elsewhere the differences are much smaller (cf. columns 1—6

and

5—8).

A.3 Consumer Price Inflation and Interest Rates. 1981—90

Forecasters underpredicted the CPI inflation just as they did the IPD
inflation (see the negative signs of the mean errors in Table A.7, lines 1—5,
columns 1 and 3). The RHSEs of these forecasts are discouragingly large compared
to the descriptive statistics for the actual values (cf. columns 4 and 6 with 11,

in particular). Note that the NBER—ASA

survey

questionnaire asked directly for

forecasts of the level of Cl'I inflation at annual rate in the current quarter and

the following four quarters (not for forecasts of the CPI itself).

In contrast, the forecasts of the 3—month Treasury bill rate (TBR) had
relatively small errors according to these comparisons (lines 6—10). The

forecasts of the (new high—grade) corporate bond yield (CBY) were even more
accurate (lines 11—15).
Despite the already noted weakness of most of the individual CPI forecasts.

the corresponding group mean forecasts perform relatively well. Their RNSEs are

considerably smaller than those of the &VAR model, and less than half those of
the average individual forecasts (cf. Table A.8, lines 1—5, and Table .7, lines

1—5. columns 4 and 6). The i/g ratios cluster close to one between Q1

which

and Q,

indicates that the forecasts concerned are remarkably alike.

For the interest rates TR and CBY, combining the individual forecasts
greatly reduces errors, but with notable exceptions at the most distant target

quarter (5). Here the RMSEs are much larger for the &VAR than the group mean
forecasts, and correspondingly the

i/by ratios

are much lower than the i/g ratios

(cf. Table A.8, lines 6—15, columns 1—4 and 5—8).
