THE IMPACT OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING LEGISLATION ON DISPUTES
IN THE U.S. PUBLIC SECTOR: NO POLICY MAY BE THE WORST POLICY

ABSTRACT
This paperestimates the impact of collective bargaining legislation on disputes during labor
negotiations in the U.S. public sector. We use a large national sample of U.S. state and local
government contracts to compare the incidence and intensity of disputes by similar workers under
different forms of collective bargaining legislation. The breadth of our data allows us to examine
the impact

of five

different forms

of legislation.

Our principal finding is that strike Costs,

measured by strike duration and the number of working days lost, are highest in jurisdictions that
provide no explicit framework for bargaining or dispute resolution.

I, Introduction
Disputes during labor negotiations can be extremely costly. This

is

especially true in the

public sector where the government may be the sole supplier of an essential service. Yet, despite
concerns about the costs of disputes, legislators have not reached a consensus on the best form

of policy to minimisedisputes.

As a result, public sector negotiations are governed by a diverse

set of lax that vary by state and occupation of the employees. This paper contributes to the
debate over the best form of collective bargaining legislation in the public sector by estimating
the impact of the legal structure on the form, frequency, and intensity of disputes.
We consider two main aspects of the legislation: the laws regarding the employees'
bargaining rights and the provision of procedures to resolve disputes. In the U.S. private sector,
most employees have the right to strike and all employers are required to bargain in 'good faith"
with a legally-constitutedunion. In contrast, in the U.S. public sector, employers are not required
to bargain with a union in manyjurisdictions and in the majority ofjurisdictions, strikes arc Ilegal.
Many of the jurisdictions that prohibit strikes provide no institutional procedures to resolve
disputes. Some jurisdictions that prohibit strikes, however, require that public sector disputes he
resolved by a neutral third-party -- an arbitrator. Some jurisdictions in the public sector grant
workers the right to strike.
Ideally,we would like to examine the impactof collective bargaining legislation on the cost
of disputes. However, in the absence of data on dispute costs we examine the impact on the
incidence of strikes, the length of strikes, and the number of working days lost due to strikes.
We also examine the impact of collective bargaining legislation on the incidence of negotiations
ended by an arbitrator imposing an award.
Previousstudies of the impact of collectivebargaininglegislation on disputes have suffered
from a lack of a large data set of disputes in the U.S. public sector. This limits both the forms

of legal structure that they were ahic te examine and the ability to generalize the reaulta from
these atudiea to etherjuriadieriona. For example, ichniowaki'a (1932) study of police disputes and
Wheeler's (1975) atudy of fircfighteraexamined the impact of legislation on diaputea by workera
in only one occupation. And while Olson (1986) examined the impact of legislation on workers
in foor different occupations, his data only covered strikes in six states. Currie and McConnell
(1991) examined the impactoflegislation on disputes using a large data set of Canadian contracts.
However, because of the major differences in both the industrial relations environment and the
existing forms of collective bargaining legialatien between Canada and the United Stases, the
results of Currie and McConnell (1991) should not be generalized to the U.S. public sector.

in this

study, we use

a large data act of U.S. state and local government contracts

negotiated between 1971 and 1986. This data act baa four advantages over data sets used in
previous atudlea of the impact of collective bargaining legislation on disputes in the U.S. public
sector. First, she data set coverscontracts from a wide variety of different types of workers under
different forms of legislation. These contracts were negotiated by workers in 8 different
occupations and 40 states. The breadth of the data set allows us to eatimatc the impact of five
mutually-exclusivecategories of collective bargaining legislation.
Second, because the data span 16 years we are able to observe changes in legislation over
time. We exploit this variation by controlling in our models for the state in which the
negotiations took place and the occupation of the workem.
Third, unlike all previous studlea of disputes in the U.S. public sector, the unit

of

observation is a contract negotiation. Contract data allow us to calculate the proportion

of

contract negotiations that end in a strike or an arbitration: the probability of a dispute. This
measure of dispute incidence controla for changes in the opportunities for a dispute afforded by
changes in she number of contract negotiations. No diapute rates for a nationally-based sample

Collective Bargaining Legislation

by the occupation

workers.

of this study, however, we lump together

similar forms of legislationinto live categories.For shorthand,we call thesecategories:(1) no

duty to bargain, (2) doty to bargain, (3) volonsary arbitration, (4) compulsory arbitration, and (5)
right to strike. All

of the

contracts in our data set fall into one, and only one,

of these

live

categories.
We identilied the collective bargaininglegislation in effect during the negotiation of each
of the contracts in our data act using the National Bureau

of Economic Research

(NBER)

Collective Bargaining Law Data Set. We updated the data set to 1986 using the annual
descriptions of changes in labor lassa published by the U.S. Department

of Labor, Bureau of

Labor Statistics (BLS) in the Monthly Labor Review. This is the best available source

of

informationon collective bargaininglegislationin the U.S. public sector and ia described in detail

in Valletta and Freeman (1988). Table I showsthe relationshipsbetween our live categories of
legislation and the categories of legislation as defined in the NBER data set.

A clear

relationship exists between the provision of collective bargaining rights and the

provision of dispute-resolution procedures. Forexample, it is rare for a jurisdiction that does not
require employers to bargain with their employees to provide the right to strike or to provide
institutions to facilitate the arbitration of disputes. Hence, we do not study the impact of the
provision of collective bargaining rights and dispute resolution procedures as two unrelated
aspects of the legislation. Instead, each of our live categories of legislation is defined in terms
of both she prevision of collective bargaining rights and the provision of dispute-resolution
procedures.
The first category

of legislation--no duty to bargain--covers legal

structures in which

employers are not required so bargain, employees do not have she right to strike, and no
provision is provided for arbitration. It includes jurisdictions in which there is no law that
discusses collective bargaining ("no provision" in

the NBER data set). jurisdictions in which

collective bargaining is explicitly prohibited, and jurisdictions in which she employer is authorized

to bargain or the union has the right to present proposals or meet and confer" hut the employer
is not required to bargain.

Contracts are still negotiated even in jurisdictions in which employers arc not required to
were negotiated in no-dutybargain. In our sample of 1,005 contracts, 175 contracts (17 percent)
to-bargainjurisdictions (see Table 1). Eight contractswere even negotiated in jurisdictions which
explicitly prohibited collective bargaining.

Employees in the public sector do not hsve the right to strike unless legislation explicitly
gives them the right to do so. In our sample, slightly more than half of the contracts in the noduty-to.hargain category were negotiated in jurisdictions in which strikes were explicitly
prohibited. We do not obsee any jurisdictions in which strikes were permitted hot employers
were not required to bargain with a union.
The second category of legislation .- duty to bargain .- covers legislation that explicitly or
implicitly requires employers

to bargain with employees in

"good faith" but does not provide

employees the right to strike or any binding dispute-resolution procedures. The legislation may,
however, require that the bargaining parties take a dispute to mediation or fact-finding. In
mediation and fact.[inding, a neutral third-party recommends a settlement but the parties are not
bound to act on this recommendation. In our sample, 344 contracts (34 percent) fall into the
duty-to-bargain category.
In some jurisdictions legislation explicitly requires the employer to bargain in ood faith
In others, the legislation jggjjes that employersmust bargain in good faith but does

took the view that this typc of legislation implicitly requircd the employers to bargain in good
faith. Placing these contracts into the no-duty-to-bargaincategory instead of the duty-to-bargain
category did not change any of the conclusionsof this study.
The third category of legislation -- voluntary arbitration -- includes all legislation that
requires (either explicitly or implicitly) the employer to bargain with the union, does not give
employees the right to strike, and provides for binding voluntary arbitration. Under voluntary
arbitration both parties must agree to take their dispute to an arbitrator and the bargaining pair
is

0by

his or her decision. Because under arbitration the parties are bound by the decision

of the third party,

it differs from mediation and fact-finding under which the parties are free to

reject the suggested settlement. The legislationmay specifysome form of mediation in addition

to voluntary arbitration. In our sample, 208 contracts

(21 percent) fall into

the voluntary

arbitration category.
The fourth form oflegislation-- compulsoryarbitration-- includes all legislation that does

not provide employees the right to strike and provides for some form of binding compulsory
arbitration. Under compulsory arbitration, any unresolved dispute must go so arbitration. In
contrast to voluntary arbitration, either party can take the dispute to arbitration even against the
wishes of the other party. As under voluntary arbitration, both parties are bound by the
arbitrator's decision. In our sample, all jurisdictions that provide compulsory arbitration explicitly
prohibit strikes.
Our compulsory-arbitrationcategory includes legislationthat both mandates arbitration by
law and legislation that falls under

the category discretionary in the NBER data set. Under

discretionary arbitration, arbitration may be initiated by an administrative agency cither
unilaterallyor upon request of a party (Valletta and Freeman, 1988, page 403). We classify this
as compulsory arbitration because either party may take the negotiations

to an arbitrator.t

In our sample, all jurisdictions that provide the right to strike also require

employers (either explicitly

or implicitly)to bargain in good faith with their

employees. In our

data, 173 contracts (17 percent) fall into this category.
Seventeen contracts in our sample were negotiated in jurisdictions that provided the right

to strike and also legislated compulsory arbitration (in either the NBER 'discretionary' or
arbitration as an
'required by statute' categories). We interpret the provision of compulsory

by the potential for ad hoe legislative intervention and so we interpret the provision

of this type of intervention.

The importance

of each of our

legislation categories changed over time.

The trend

towards more pro-bargaining legislation noted by Freeman and Valletta (1988) is reflected in our
sample: 23 percent of all contracts were signed in no-duty-to-bargainjurisdictions between 1971
and 1978 compared with 15 percent between 1979 and 1986. In contrast the right-to-strike
category hat become more important over time. While 13 percent of all contracts in our sample
were negotiated under the right to strike between 1971 and 1978, 19 percent of all contracts were
negotiated under the right to strike between 1979 and t986.
III. A Description of the Data
Thu basisof our data set is a list of 1,005 contract negotiations that occurred between 1971
and 1986. We constructed the list ofcontract negotiationsfrom the Current Waco Developments
(CWD), a monthly publication of the BLS that lists major contracts recently negotiated in the
private and public sector that involved 1,000 or more workers.
The CWD includes information on the date the contract was effective, the date the
contract was negotiated, the length of the contract, the names

of the

employer and union

involved in thu negotiariona, the state in which the contract was negotiated, and the number of

workers covered by the contract. The CWD also states whether a strike or arbitration occurred
at the negotiation and whether the settlement was imposed by legislation.

Unfortunately, the

CWD does not include information on the wage level negotiated in the new contract.
Thu DES does nut publish information on all large public sector contracta.4 Hence we
were unable to construct a full panel of contracts for each bargainingpair over the sample period.
The data include ccntrscts negotiated by 584 different employer-unionbargaining paira; we have
more than two contracts for only 9$ of these bargainingpairs. The
8

lists more contracta in

the later years of our sample: 64 percent of the contracts in the sample were negotiated in the
last 5 years

of the 16-year sample period.

A striking feature of collective bargaining legislation is its variation across
an occupation group.

workers

ijhin

From the name of the employer and the name of the union we could

identify eight occupation groups of workers covered by the contracts in the sample: teachers,
police, fire-fighters, hospital workers, city white-collar workers, other city workers, university
faculty, and other state employees.

The distribution of contracts by law category for each

occupation group of workers is shown in Appendix Table

I

No one occupation group negotiates

under a single type of legislation. Teachers, university faculty, and hospital workers are the
groups moSt likely to negotiate in ,jurisdictions with neither arbitration nor the right to strike.
Essential workers -- police and fire-fighters-- rarely have the right to strike and are the groups
most likely to be providedwith some form of arbitration.

The Industrial Relations Facts (IRF), a weekly BLS internal publication, records
information on all strikes that involved 1,000 or more workers.

From this publication, we

constructed a list of all strikes that occurred between 1971 and 1986 in the public sector. The

IRF includes informationon the name of the employer, the name of the union, the state in which
the strike occurred, the beginning and ending date of the strike, and the number of workers
involved in the strike.

For each strike we checked to see whether it occurred at a contract

negotiation in our sample.

If it did, we supplemented information

on the strike from the

with information from the IRF.

It

is important to note that we only include in our sample disputes over contract

negotiations.

Unlike previous studies using more aggregated data, (for example, Ichniowski,

1982), we can distinguish between strikes that occur at the negotiation

of a new contract

strikes that occur at other times over other issues, such as grievance resolution

As the determinants of strikes probably vary by the cause of the strike, it is

Strikes occurred at

negotiations. Compared to the private sector the probability of a

strike in the public sector is low -- between 12 and 15 percent of contract negotiations in the
U.S. private sector end in a strike (McConnell, 1990). Five percent of the contract negotiations
in

our sample were settled by arbitration and 5.5 percent

of the settlements

were imposed by

legislation. The incidence of all disputes--resolvedby either a strike, an arbitration, or a legislated
settlement--fluctuated from year to year. However, there was a general decline throughout the
1980s in the incidence of all three types of dispute. Although no aggregate public sector strike

or arbitration rates arc available, this decline mirrors the decline in the aggregate number

of

strikes in the United States during the j9gQ•6
IV. The Incidence of Strikes and Arbiti-ationa

The goal of most collective bargaining laws

is

to reduce the frequency of disputes. A

dispute can be resolved in three ways: by a strike, by an award made by an arbitrator, or by a
settlement imposed by legislation. Table 2 shows the number of contract negotiations in our
sample that were settled without a dispute, by a strike, by an arbitration, and by a legislated
settlement. It also shows the average strike length and the average number of working days lost
due to strikes under each type of law.
Strikes occurred under each of our five categories of legislation even though strikes are
illegal under all of our legislation categories except the right-to-strike category. Strike incidnce
is highest when the parties have neither

a duty to bargain nor dispute resolution procedures -10

over 13 percent of all contracts negotiated in jurisdictionswith no-duty-to-bargainlegislationend
in a strikeY In our sample, a strike occurred in just under 10 percent of all contract
negotiations in jurisdictions where strikes are legal.
Arbitrations also occurred under everycategory of legislation including legislation that did

not require the state to set up any institution to facilitatearbitration. Even under right-to-strike
legislation, an arbitrator settled about 2 percent of contract negotiations. But, not surprisingly,
most arbitrations took place under compulsoryarbitration legislation -- an arbitrator settled just
under 30 percent

of contracts

negotiated under compulsory arbitration. The frequency of

arbitration did not vary greatly between different typesof compulsoryarbitration -- the incidence
of arbitration is just under 4 percentage points higher under [mat-offer compulsory arbitration
than under conventional compulsory arbitration.
A legislated settlement was imposed most frequentlyin jurisdictions without arbitration or

the right to strike -- our no-duty-to-bargain and duty-to-bargain categories. More than one in
nine contracts negotiated in jurisdictions with no-duty-to-bargainlaw were settled by a legislator
imposing an award. Legislated settlements were rare under compulsory arbitration --

in

our

sample only one legislated settlement occurred under compulsory arbitration.
Disputes -- strikes, arbitrations, and legislated settlements -- were most frequent under
compulsory arbitration legislation. Only 66 percent

of contracts

were negotiated without a

dispute under final-offer compulsoryarbitration. Disputeswere least frequent injurisdictions with
duty-to-bargain legislation but without arbitration or the right to strike. Over 88 percent

of

contracts were negotiated without a dispute under duty-to-bargain legislation compared to art
average of 83 percent for the whole sample.

If factors other than the form of collective bargaining legislation are important
determinants

of dispute

rates, the pattern of 'raw' strike and arbitration rates by collective

bargaining law shown in Table 2 may be misleading. To control for the effects of other
11

determinants of the incidence of strikes and arbitrations, we estimate models of whether the
negotiation was settled by a strike and whether the negotiation was settled by an arbitration. The
strike models are presented in columns

I

through

of Table 3; the arbitration models are

presented in columns 4 through 6.8 We do not estimate models of legislated settlements as the
parties to the negotiations may not have direct control over whether a legislator imposes an
award.

of our

models contains a dummy variable for each

main categories of

We only present the results of models that

include one dummy variable to capture the effect of both conventional and final-offer arbitration

because there was never a significant difference between the impact

of the

two forms of

compulsoryarbitration in any model we estimated.
To control for variation across states in the economy, the industrial relations environment,
and the political climate, we include state dummies in columns 1. 2, 4, and 5

of Table 39

Columns 3 and 6 of Table 3 present estimates of models that do not include state dummies. In

each model, we also include the state unemployment rate, the average hourly earnings in
manufacturing in the state, and the size of the state's labor force,10 We estimate the models
presented in Table 3 using ordinary least squares.1t
To control for variation in strike and arbitration incidence across different types of
workers, we include dummy variables for the occupation of the workers in each model. As the

size of the collective bargaining unit may affect both the benefit from and the cost of a dispute,
we also include the number of workers in the bargaining unit in each model.12 To capture
changes over time that occurred nationwide,we include year dummies in each model. These year
dummies should pick up any general macroeconomic impacts on

the incidence of disputes in

The introduction of collective bargaining legislation is unlikely to he completely random.
In particular, it may be affected by the recent incidence of disputes. For example, a change in
legislation maybe triggered by a particularlylarge strike in the public sector. If the introduction
of collective bargaining law is correlated with the incidence of strikes

a problem with all existing models of the impact of collective

bargaining law on disputes and cannot he solved until an adequate model of the determinants of
the introduction of collective bargaining legislation has been developed (Ehrcnherg and Schwarz,
1986). As yet, such

a model does not

exist (see Farber, 1988, for an example of an attempt at

this type of model). However, most changes in collective bargaining legislation occurred before
1979 (Farber, t988). To reduce

of Table

the likelihood of an endogericity bias, we estimate our models

3 on the sample of contracts that were negotiated in 1979 or

laier13
The results presented in Table 3 suggest that introducing duty-to-bargain legislation,
without granting workers the right to strike or providing for arbitration, would decrease the
incidence ofstrikes by between 7 and

11

percentage points. When the model is estimated on the

whole sample (its columns 1 and 3), the hypothesis that the form of legislation has no impact on
strike incidence is rejected by art F-teat at a 10 percent level ofsignificance. This confirms results
of earlier studies which looked only at specific occupation groups. For example, Sternand Olson
(1982) found strikes highest in jurisdictions with no-duty-to-bargain legislation in a study

of

disputes by police, teachers, and fire-fighters. Also, Ichniowski (1982) in a study of police strikes
found that a switch from no-duty-to-bargain legislation to duty-to-bargain legislation reduced
strikes. However, Currie and McConnell (1991) found no significant difference in the strike
incidence in jurisdictions with and without duty-to-bargain legislation in the Canadian public
sector. But, in Canada nearly all jurisdictions require employers to bargain in good faith with a
union.

Our estimates suggest that, given that employers are required to bargain in good faith,
strikes are more frequent if they are legal. In column I

the right-to-strike dummy are significantly negative. Ao F-test rejects

the hypothesis thst all forms of duty-to-bargainlegislation have the same impart at a 10 percent
level of significance when the model is estimated on the full sample. However, there is no
statistically significant difference between she incidence of strikes under the right to strike and

the incidence of strikes under no-duty-to-bargain legislation.
The incidence of strikes in our sample is lowest under compulsoryarbitration. The results
in Table 3 show that the incidence of strikes is between 5 and 13 percentage points lower under
eompulaory arbitration than under the right to strike. This result ia alao similar to findings
reported previouslyfor specific occupation groups. In the U.S. public sector, Ichniowaki(1982)
found that arbitration reduced strikes by police and Wbeeler (1975) found that arbitration
reduced atrikea by fire-fighters. Currie and McConnell(1991) found that in the Canadian public
sector strikes are about 5 percentage pointa more frequent under the right to strike than under
compulsoryarbitration.
A atriking. although not surprising, result in Table 3 is that arbitrations are used most
frequently under compulsoryarbitration. Conventionalcompulsoryarbitration is often criticized
for discouraging or "chilling" negotiations (Stevens, 1966). For example, some argue that
arbitrators under conventional arbitration "split the difference" between the final-offers of the
negotiating partiet.

If negotiating parties anticipate

thia behavior, they may take extreme

positions that discourage negotiations and increase the probability of a dispute. Our eatimatea
suggestthat the introduction of compulsoryarbitration into a jurisdiction with no-duty-to-bargain
legislation increases the incidence of arbitration by between 22 and 39 percentage points.

Our estimates also suggest that replacingvoluntary arbitration with compoltory arbitration
increases the probability of an arbitration by between 15 and 23 percentage pointa. F-teats
14

ovcrwhclmingly reject the hypothesis that the introduction of the duty to bargain, with or without
dispute resolution procedures. into a jurisdictionwith no-duty-to-bargain legislation has no impact
on the incidence of arbitration.

The estimates in Table 3 suggest that making strikes legal significantly reduces the
probability
the

of an arbitrated

settlement. We predict that switching from voluntary arbitration to

right to strike decreasesthe incidence of arbitration by between 26 and 28 percentage points

(if we include state dummies in the model). As most jurisdictions with the nght to strike also
provide

for voluntary arbitration,the finding

that a switch from voluntary arbitration to the right

to strike increases strike incidence and decreases arbitration incidence suggests that bargaining
pairs prefer

to settlea dispute with a strike rather than an arbitration when they have the choice

between the two,

The results presented in columns 3 and 6

of Table

3 underline the importance

of

controlling for the State 0 which the negotiations take place. When state dummies are excluded
from the strike model (in column 3), the coefficients on all the legislation variables show a
positive bias. This suggests that,

for some reason not

captured by the variables in the model,

states with frequent strikes are more likely to have legislation that requires employers to bargain.
When state dummies are excluded from the arbitration model (in column 6), the coefficienton
the right to strike dummy exhibits

a

large positive bias, while the coefficients on the other

legislation variables show a negative bias. This suggests that Stateswith frequent arbitrations are
more likely to have either no-duty-to-bargain legislation or duty-to-bargain legislation and the

right to strike.
Restricting the sample to include only those contracts negotiated after most

of the law

changes have taken place (1979 through 1986) does not have a significant impact on the estimates

in Table 3. However, estimates of the impact of legislation on strike incidence in the period

1979

to 1986 are slightly lower (in absolute terms) than those made using the whole sample (compare
15

columns I and

2 oF Table 3).

Rcatricting the sample to those contracts negotiated during the

period 1979 to 1986 has little impact on the estimates of the impact of legislation on the
incidence of arbitration (compare columns 4 and 5 of Table 3).
Turning to she impact of the other explanatoryvariablet on the incidence of strikes and
arbitrations, we find that an increase in the state unemployment rate has no impact on the
probability of a strike but increases the probability of an arbitration by between I and

2

percentage points. The negative correlation between strike incidence and unemployment in the
private sector is well documented (Vrornan, 1989). So it is surprising that the inverse relationship
between strike incidence and unemployment does not hold in the public sector.t4

This may

be because the ability of the state government to pay for wage increases falls in a recession. And,
while in the private sector the cost

of a strike to the employees rises in a recession as it becomes

easier for them to be replaced, in the public sector the cost of a strike to the employee probably
does not rise much in a recessionbecause publicsector strikers are unlikely to lose their jobs and
be replaced by other workers. None of the other explanatory variables have a consistent and
significantimpact on the incidence of strikes or arbitrations.
V.

Strike Duration and Working Days Lost Due to Strikes

Perhaps more important than the impact of collective bargaining legislation on the
incidence of strikes is its impact on the cost of disputes. Disputes are not all equally costly. For
example, although strikes are more frequent in jurisdictionswith no-duty-to-bargain legislation,
it may be

that the strikes that do occur are so short that the total cost of strikes in these

jurisdictions is negligible.

It is

beyond the scope

of this

paper to evaluate the impact

of

legislation on the cost of disputes. Instead, we examine the impact of legislation on two variables

that are highly correlated with the

Cost of a strike: the length of the strike and

the number of

working days lost because of the strike. We do not cstimstc the cost of arbitration hearings. But
16

as an arbitration hearing is typically

so muchless costly than a strike, in most jurisdictions the cost

of arbitrations constitutes only a small fraction of the total cost of disputes.15

The average strike length and the average number of working days lost due to strikes
of
are shown in Table 2. The number of working days lost due to a
under each
type

legislation

strike is the product of the strike length and the number of workers involved in the strike.t6
Strikes are, on average, longer and involve more working days lost when they are legal.

li-i

our

sample, the average strike under the right to strike lasted 18 days and involved the loss of 184,000
workingdays compared to an average strike length of 14 days and a loss of 107.000working days
in the sample as a whole. In contrast, under all forms of arbitration, strikes tend to he short and
involve the loss of fewer working days.t7 When employers are

not required to bargain -- our

no-duty-to-bargain
legislation-- strikes are about 4 days longer and involve the loss of about the
same number of working days as the average strike in our sample.
On the basis of sample averages of strike duration and the number of working days lost
doe to strikes, Currie and McConnell (1991) conclude that in the Canadian public sector strikes

are longer and involve the loss of more working days when they are legal. But strikes may be
longer when they are legal because workers who rarely strike for long, such as police and fireIn this study, we
fighters, are more likely to be covered by legislation that prohibits strikes.
estimate models of strike duration and days lost due to strikes and control for other determinants
of the intensity of the strike.
We present the results of the estimation of models of strike duration and the number
days lost due to strikes irs Table 4. Itt each column, the dependent variables

is

of

'unconditional"

on a strike occurring .- if no strike occurred at a contract negotiation the dependent variable is
Set equal

to zero..8 Thus, we interpret the estimates of the coefficients in Table 4

as

measuring the impact of the explanatory variables on the product of the probability of a strike
occurring and the intensity of a strike if one occurs -- the expected strike length or the expected
17

number

of working days lost.

In our sample, the average unconditional strike duration is I

dayt9 and the average unconditional number
models

of strike

of days

lost due to strikes is 7,769 days. The

duration and working days lost presented in Table

4

include the same

explanatory variables as the models of strike and arbitration incidence presented in Table 3.
The results presented in Table 4 suggest that strikes are most costly in jurisdictions in
which employers are not required to bargain in good faith with the union. Both unconditional
strike duration and the unconditional number of days lost due to strikes are higher in jurisdictions
with no-duty-to-bargain law. (Except in column 2 of Table 4, F-tests reject the hypothesis that
the coefficients on the four main legislation variables are equal to zero at the 90 percent level

of confidence.)

The point estimates suggest that switching from no-duty-to-bargain legislation to

duty-to-bargain legislation would reduce the unconditionalstrike duration by about 1.7 days and
reduce the unconditional number of working days lost due to strikes by between 10 and 22 days.

The average strike in our sample is as long when strikes are legal as when there is no-dutyto-bargain legislation (see Table 2). However, once we control for the state in which the strike
took place (see columns

1

and 2 of Table 4), we find that switching from no-duty-to-bargain

legislation to the right to strike decreases the expected length of strikes by nearly 2 days. Our
point estimates also suggest that switching from the right to strike to compulsory arbitration
would decrease the expected length of a strike by about I day and decrease the expected number

of working days lost by between

15 and 20 days, although these differences

are not statistically

significant.
As in our models of strike incidence, we find that omitting state dummies from the model

of strike duration

and working days lost due to strikes biases upwards the coefficients on the

legislation variables. Thus states with many, long, and costlystrikes are more likely to introduce
some form of collective bargaining lcgilation.

18

VI. l)iscusslon

The most striking conclusion from this study

is

that those jurisdictions that have neither

legislation requiring employers to bargain in good faith nor legislation that provides some form
of procedure for dispute resolution experience the most costly strikes measured in terms of the
expected length of the strike and the number of working days lost due to strikes. While most of
these jurisdictions do not explicitly prohibit bargaining,they do not have legislation that provides
employees with the right to engage in collective bargaining. Granting workers both the right to
bargain and the right to strike does not seem to increase the incidence of strikes but may
decrease the expected length of a strike and working days lost because of sirikes. Requiring
employers to bargain and providingsome form of arbitration reduces all three measures of strike
framework for bargaining or dispute
activity. Hence, our results suggest that providing no explicit
resolution is the worst industrial relations policy.
Our results are less conclusiveabout the best form of industrial relations policy. While our
point estimates suggest that the expected duration and number of working days lost due to strikes
is lowest under compulsory arbitration, these differences are

not ststistically significant. The

incidence of strikes is lowest under compulsory arbitration, but the incidence of arbitrations is
highest under compulsory arbitration. However, an srbitration is so much less costly than a
typicalstrike that the incidence of arbitrations is much less important than the incidence of strikes
from a policy perspective
While our results provide useful information for assessing the effectiveness of different
types of collective bargaining legislation, these results alone are not sufficient to make policy
recommendations. Future research should aim to measure more directly the cost of disputes.
This would involve collecting data about the cost of arbitration hearings and estimating the value

of output or services lost during a strike

As emphasized by our study, these data should cover

19

a wide variety of typea of workera and atatea.

We look at only one aapect of

the outcome of

contract negotiations: disputes. Future research should alao examine the impact of legialation
ctn other important ootcomea, aueh aa the wage level, the level
package, the degree

of employment,

of indexation specified in the contract, and she length

Endnotes

I. Five contracts in our sample were negotiated in jurisdictions in which the legislation
authorizes, but does not require, the employer to bargain but also requires any dispute to go to
compulsoi-y arbitration. We interpreted the compulsory arbitration clause as implicitly requiring
the employer to bargain in good faith.
2. When the ditpute is over multiple issues, some jurisdictions require arbitrators to decide on
each negotiating issue separately, while other jurisdictions require arbitrators to choose between
the employer's and union's packages of offers. We do not make a distinction between these
forms of final-offer arbitration.
3. Iowa operates a tn-offer arbitration system. In this system a fact.finder first recommends an
award and the arbitrator must then choose between the two final offers of the negotiating parties
and the fact-finder's recommended award, Only seven contracts in our sample were negotiated
under this tn-offer system so we place them in the category of final-offer arbitration. Two
contracts in the sample -- both covering police in Boston -- were negotiated in jurisdictions that
give the bargaining parties the choice of settling their disputes with either conventional or finaloffer arbitration. These two contracts were classified into the final.offer arbitration category.
4. The contracts included in the CWD arc those viewed as "significant"by the BLS. The BLS
are more likely to include in the listingscontracts that cover many workers. We do not rule out
the possibilityof some sample selection bias.
5. See Ichniowski (1986) for a study of the impactof legislation en recognition strikes.

The BLS publishes a series of the aggregate number of strikes in the United States in the
Monthly Labor Review.

7. Olson (1988) argues that strikes are under-reported in jurisdictions with no collective
bargaining law. If this is the case, 13 percent may be an underestimate of the strike frequency
itt jurisdictions with no-duty-to-bargain legislation.
8. Two contracts involved both a strike and an arbitration and four contracts involved both a
strike and a legislated settlement. In our strike models, we count the disputes at all six contracts
as a strike and in our arbitration models, we count the disputes at the two contracts with both
a strike and an arbitration as an arbitration.
9. We include a dummy variable for all but two states that are represented in our sample. Only
one contract in our sample was negotiated in each of these two states,
10.

We describe the sources of the explanatoryvariables in an Appendix,

11. Nonlinear models corresponding to the models shown in columns I and 4 of Tables 3 and
4 are shown in Appendix Table 2. These models yield conclusions that are qualitatively similar
to those discussed in the text. However,compared to the estimates made from she linear models,
the estimates from the nonlinear models are much less precise and are sensitive to the
specificationof the model. Hence, we regard the point estimates from the linear models as more
reliable.

21

l2.We do not control for other contract-specific variables,such as the lengthof the contract or
the degree of indexation, because of the potential for endogeneity bias. Including such variables
in the models did not alter our conclusions from the study.

In our wholesample, only 43 contracts were negotiated in the same year as a law change that
affected workers in the same occupation and state, and only 15 of these occurred after 1979.
