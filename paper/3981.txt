STATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND PRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE

ABSTRACT
The impact of public infrastructure investment on the productive performance of firms

has been an important focus of the recent literature on productivity growth. The size of this
impact has important implications for policymakers' decisions to invest in public capital, and
productivity analysts' evaluation of productivity growth fluctuations and declines. However,
detailed evaluation of the infrastructure impact is difficult using existing studies which rely on
restricted models of firms' technology and behavior.

In this paper we construct a more complete production theory model of firms'
production and input decisions. We then apply our framework to state-level data on the
output production and input (capital, nonproduction and production labor and energy) use of
manufacturing firms to evaluate the contribution of infrastructure to firms' costs and

productivity growth. We find that infrastructure investment does provide a significant direct
benefit to manufacturing firms and thus augments productivity growth. We also show,
however, that this evidence should be interpreted taking into account the social cost of such

capital (which is not reflected in firms' costs), and the indirect impact resulting from scale
effects.

I. Introduction
Traditional measures of productivity growth typically neglect forces

external to firms. In fact, they tend to ignore both external and internal
scale effects in the long and short run by assuming constant returns to scale

in measured inputs and instantaneous adjustment. However, both external and
internal economies may greatly affect short and long run economic performance,
since they affect the observed relationship between costs and output.

Public infrastructure investment is an important example of a good which

could generate external economies. If expenditures on public capital have a
positive productive impact -. and thus cause cost savings for firms which are
currently experiencing economic difficulties -

- the

implications for policy

decisions concerning infrastructure investment may be great. Internal effects
such as long run scale economies and short run fixities are also important to

recognize for evaluation of productive performance. Recognition of these
impacts may provide insights about the impacts of expansionary policies and
investment incentive programs.

Recently, a number of studies on productivity growth determinants have

focused on the impacts of infrastructure and scale effects. Aschauer
(1989,1990], for example, reported and compared correlations between
productivity growth and public infrastructure across countries, and found a
close correspondence between productivity slowdowns and stagnation in

infrastructure expenditure. The importance of this external effect on
productive performance has been further explored by a number of researchers
including Munnell [1990], Garcia-Mila and McGuire [forthcoming], and Hulten

and Schwab [1984,1991]. In addition, the significant influence of internal
scale effects on productivity growth has been documented by Morrison [19891,
as well as by Hall (1990].

-2-

These studies show that the standard maintained assumptions about
external and internal scale effects are neither intuitive a priori, nor
empirically valid for the construction of productivity growth measures.

However, existing studies have not pursued an integrated analysis of the
interactions among these scale effects and their impact on economic

performance. Existing production models have generally disregarded the
potentially large impact of public infrastructure on firms' costs and

therefore economic performance, even when they incorporate fixity effects. On
the other hand, most studies in the rapidly emerging literature on the
productivity impact of infrastructure do not take advantage of the extensive
framework for the analysis of firm behavior, technology and performance
provided in the applied production theory literature.1

In this paper we attempt to synthesize these approaches to explore the
role of infrastructure capital in productivity growth in greater detail for

U.S. manufacturing by state. To accomplish this, we extend the production
theory framework developed in Morrison [1989] to formalize and measure the

effects of public infrastructure capital. Our analysis is based on cost-side
productivity growth measures, which are designed to capture the reduction in
input use (and thus costs) used to produce a given output level when technical

change occurs. When external and internal scale economies and fixity affect
firm technology and behavior, cost reductions due to changes in these

characteristics also occur. Our cost-oriented productivity growth framework
provides a useful vehicle for disentangling these effects by explicitly
recognizing the dependence of costs, and thus the cost-output relationship, on
infrastructure, scale economies and short run

fixity

of private capital.

'The advantages of using a production theory framework based on a variable cost
function and shadow values have, however, been emphasized by Friedlaender
[1990) and Berndt and Hansson [1991].

-3-

Identifying and measuring these different cost effects requires a full
theoretical and empirical fraxnevork representing firm technology and behavior.

In the following sections such a framework is outlined and used to assess the

impacts of infrastructure on costs and thus on productivity growth. Estimates
of this model by region, obtained using a rich panel data set, are then

presented. The data are for the manufacturing sectors of the 48 contiguous
states in the U.S. for 1970-87, and include information on the quantities and
prices of output, nonproduction and production labor, energy, and private and
public capital inputs.

Estimation of the model generates results that support the use of a

parametric structural model for considering infrastructure effects. Shadow
values for both private and public capital are the appropriate sign and

magnitude, and are significantly different from zero. They show a positive
but declining cost benefit from infrastructure investment in all regions, with

the most dramatic declines being in the "snowbelt" (North-East). When
productivity growth measures are decomposed accordingly, it appears that
infrastructure investment has contributed significantly to regional U.S.

productivity growth. However, that impact has diminished over time due to
both reduced investment rates, and lower values of such investment. This is
particularly true when the social cost of such investment is taken into

account. Also, using the structural model we show that sluggish investment in
public capital relative to output production appears to have actually limited
productivity growth, particularly in the sunbelt (South-West).

II. A Model of Firm Behavior and Productivity Growth with Infrastructure
Effects

ha. The Theoretical Model
The current literature on the representation of firm technology and

behavior heavily depends on variable (restricted) cost functions. Basing
analysis on a cost function is desirable since estimating equations result
from direct differentiation of the function, and the endogeneity of the

resulting dependent variables is consistent with intuition.2 The cost
function reflects technology as the dual to the production function, captures
cost minimizing behavior, and can accommodate fixity and scale effects through

explicit dependence on the levels of output and quasi-fixed inputs. In the
current context, the cost function approach is especially useful since the
cost effects of external factors such as public capital may be represented

explicitly. Here, public capital is included as an argument of the variable
cost function and, thus, as a factor explaining observed scale effects.

More specifically, including private capital (I() as an argument of the
function permits the effects of capital fixity to be directly considered
rather than, for example, building in an ad-hoc partial adjustment framework

as in Munnell [1990]. Explicitly recognizing infrastructure (public or
"government" capital, Kg) as a fixed input also allows the consideration of
the direct and indirect external "scale" impacts arising from the exploitation

of this good. A combination of these impacts and internal scale economies
imbedded in the technology generates scale effects observed as the cost-output

contrasts to the production function approach often used to analyze
infrastructure impacts. Estimation of the production function either takes the
form of direct estimation of the function, in which case the input levels are
the independent variables, or is done in terms of marginal product equations
where input prices become dependent variables. Either method raises serious
questions about endogeneity and exogeneity.

-5-

relationship. These cost impacts can be independently evaluated and their
effects on productive performance measured using the cost function framework.
The variable cost function can be specified in the general form
G(x,p,t,Y), where x is a vector of K quasi-fixed inputs3 xk (here private and

public capital, K and Kg) p is a vector of the prices of variable inputs

(p, the price of production labor, Li,, p, the price of nonproduction
labor, Ln, and

the price of energy inputs, E), Y is output and t is a time

counter representing technology. Specifying Kg as an xk variable in this
framework implies that scale economies are defined including this argument of

the function. This is consistent with intuition, since infrastructure may
affect the shape of the long run average cost curve, as well as with existing
studies such as Munnell [19901.
The cost impacts of infrastructure, fixity and internal scale economies
can be specified in terms of the elasticity of costs with respect to output

derived from the variable cost function. External scale economies which stem
from outside forces with public goods characteristics will cause output and

total cost changes to be nonproportional. In addition, if long run
nonconstant returns to scale are imbedded in the firm's technology, the long
run average cost curve representing this technology will be sloped; marginal

and average costs will differ. Also, in the short run at least some inputs
may not be instantaneously adjustable, resulting in a divergence between the
market price and shadow value of the quasi-fixed input(s), captured in a more

steeply sloped short run average cost curve. A combination of these impacts
will determine the observed cost-output relationship.

3These inputs are subject to homogeneity conditions in the sense that scale
effects are dependent on them. By contrast, McFadden's environmental
variables" or "z-variables" discussed in Morrison [l988a] may have impacts on a
firm's costs but do not affect scale properties.

-6-

More formally, the definition of the long run elasticity of costs with
respect to output,

can be used to decompose the observed short run cost

response ccralnC/8lnY to distinguish these cost impacts. Following Morrison
can be written as

[1985), when nonhomotheticity exists

where CC+kpkxk is total Costs, cCk—ôlnC/ôlnxk is the elasticity of costs
with respect to fixed input xk, and

is the long run elasticity of xk

demand with respect to output.
When Kg is one of the xk variables, some qualifications should be noted.

First, this expression may appear to be inconsistent with the notion that Kg

is an exogenous variable. While including the derivative (3C/8Kg)•(dKg/dY) or
the elasticity eKgy(Y/Kg)•(dKg/dY) seems to suggest the firm will adjust the
amount of Kg in the long run, Kg is not a "choice" variable. However, the
elasticity form in (1) may be considered definitional rather than behavioral.
£KgY can be thought of as the inverse of ölflY/8lflKg from the production

function, and is included as part of the scale "experiment" rather than as a

long run adjustment expression. Second, public capital is not directly paid
for by the firm; PKg is taken to be zero. The justification is that if Kg is
exogenous, any payments made for this are not directly tied to the
availability of infrastructure and thus do not affect behavior.

Rearranging (1) in terms of the

elasticity allows us to motivate the

decomposition of observed cost changes into terms representing fixity,
internal

scale impacts and infrastructure

where the first component, c'cy, represents long run scale effects from (1).

The second and third terms, CCKpEKpy and ECKgEKgY. capture the effects of 5

fixity

and the shadow value of Kg. This can be shown as follows.
A standard property of C(s) that is crucial for applying this framework

to the analysis of infrastructure impacts on costs and productivity is that

the shadow value of input xk may be specified as Zk—-ÔG/öXk. That is, the
marginal value of input xk to the firm is the reduction in variable costs

permitted by a marginal addition to the input stock.4
The shadow value will be positive as long as xk provides benefits in

terms variable input savings due to substitution possibilities. Further, if
is a choice variable for the firm (like 5)

this

implies demand for xk in

long run equilibrium will be such that Zk—pk; if this is not true the fixity

effect is binding. However, since Kg is not a choice variable, and the firm
does not face the direct costs of accumulating this input, this balance will

not obtain for Kg even in the long run. Firms benefit from having additional
Kg as long as ZKg>O. which suggests further expenditure on public capital is
supported in terms of cost savings and thus productive performance.5

More formally, the shadow value property can be used to interpret CKp
and

and thus to attribute cost changes to fixity and infrastructure

effects. As discussed in Morrison [1985), using the definition C—C(s)+kpkxk,

it can easily be derived that ecKp_(aG/85+pKp)1Kp/C_(PKpZKp)5Kp/C. The CKp
measure will therefore be equal to zero under instantaneous adjustment or full

equilibrium, and its deviation from zero represents the degree of fixity
-

- the

extent to which the fixity constraint is binding.

4This is the inverse or MdualN of the notion of the marginal product - - the
dditional output possible by one more unit of the input.
Note that this is based only on private costs; social costs of infrastructure
are certainly positive so the social optimum would differ from this. Some of
this is addressed below. In addition, firms do pay for infrastructure in terms
of taxes; in subsequent work we plan to consider this more directly.

-8-

Similarly, when PKg0' CCKg(öC/g)Kg/Kgg/CSKg. where S*Kg is
the "shadow share" of Kg in total costs. This will not equal zero unless
infrastructure capital has a zero marginal product for the firm. Thus the
observed cost response to changing output (Cay) and the slope of the long run
cost curve (ELC?) will directly be affected by the shadow value (marginal

product) of Kg. If social costs are taken into account so PKg'O however,

EcKg''PKgKgg/C7'SKg. This more appropriately represents the net social
benefit of expenditure on Kg. since such expenditures are not costless even if

the firm does not face these costs. This should be recognized for a full
evaluation of the impacts of infrastructure investment.

Thus, (2) decomposes the scale expression CC? into a long run internal

scale effect, a fixity impact, and an infrastructure benefit adjustment. This
elaboration of

from the model structure provides a useful basis for

considering the effects of these different factors affecting firms' costs.
This has important implications for the construction, decomposition and
interpretation of productivity growth measures to identify infrastructure
impacts, since the cost-output relationship crucially affects such measures.
This linkage is further elaborated in the next subsection.

lib. Productivity Measurement and Adjustment
To motivate the analysis of efficiency changes or productive

performance, we need to formally represent productivity growth in terms of
different factors causing cost changes --

technical

change, infrastructure,

internal scale economies and fixity of K. To pursue this we use an expanded
version of the traditional cost-side specification of productivity growth:

These expressions are designed to represent efficiency change in terms

of the decrease in input use and thus costs when technical change occurs, for

a given output level and input prices. In practice, however, this residual
measure captures cost fluctuations resulting from changes in anything other
than input prices. In particular, it does not disentangle the important scale
factors shown above to affect the costs through the cost elasticity with

respect to output, y• The scale effects captured in this measure are
instead imbedded in the productivity residual or "measure of our ignorance"

ct Recognition of the factors affecting cCy therefore facilitates
appropriate measurement and interpretation of productivity growth measures.

More formally, if eC.'l due to any of the production characteristics

captured in (2), (3) is an invalid measure of technical change. Adaptation of
this measure accordingly allows us to assess the independent contributions of
these characteristics to productive performance.
For example, the construction of (3) is based on the erroneous

assumption of constant returns to scale, which implies that the cost function
can be represented by C—Yc(p,t) so cCyl and din (C/Y)/dt—dln C/dt-dln Y/dt.

choose a cost minimizing demand for xk, so the share

weight on the xk growth term should be expressed in terms of the shadow value

Adaptation of the productivity growth measure to take infrastructure

effects into account is similar to that for fixity. (2) distinguishes the
cost impact of public infrastructure as a "fixity effect" that "explains" part
of the deviation of CCI. from one separately from the more commonly recognized

cases of cy,l and ZKP7'PKP. When ZKg7'O this generates a scale effect on
productivity growth which is identifiable through its impact on eCy.

These effects can also be interpreted as the "contributions" of
infrastructure capital to productive performance, in terms of either output
growth, cost declines or productivity. To see this, we can rewrite (2'), (3')

These equations clearly distinguish the independent impacts of four
components of overall efficiency change --

technical

change, internal scale

economies, fixity of private capital, and external infrastructure effects.
Although the terms representing the impacts of variable and private fixed
inputs and scale differ somewhat according to the focus on prices (dual) or
quantities (primal), they are essentially the same for technical change and
scale as well as for infrastructure.

In addition, from the expanded version of (5') obtained by substituting
from (2), it is evident that fixity and infrastructure affect not only

for

the weights on not only quasi-fixed input growth, but also on output growth.

This suggests that the impact of infrastructure on productivity growth can be
divided into two components: the direct effect reflected by the last term in
the error bias, KgDIR —

KgIND —

S*KgI(dln

Kg/dt) and an indirect effect,

KgYS Kg1(d Y/dt).

Thus, if infrastructure capital is increasing, the direct effect causes
productivity growth to be overstated as a technical change measure; some of
the measured productivity must be attributed to infrastructure investment.
Thus, since S*Kg>O the adjusted productivity growth measure (representing only
technical change) is smaller in absolute value than the traditional measure.
Thus some productivity growth is "explained" by infrastructure effects.

The output growth term has the opposite sign; if dIn Y/dt>O, this term
represents an understatement of traditional productivity growth. Technically,
the term represents the effect of increasing output given a constant level of
Kg. so if the marginal product of Kg is positive the returns to increasing
output are less than would be the case if Kg had no productivity impact.

-13-

More intuitively, this suggests that the relative growth rates of Y and
Kg determine whether infrastructure investment has a positive impact on

productivity growth. This can be formalized by putting the two infrastructure

effect terms together to obtain S*Kg(dlnK/dtKgysdlnY/dt) as the full effect
of infrastructure. Thus, if the rate of infrastructure investment is at least
as great as the growth rate of output (adjusted by the output elasticity with

respect to government capital EKgY) standard productivity growth measures
overstate technical change - -

the

positive impact of infrastructure investment

appears as part of the technical change measure.

This development has at least two important implications. One issue
arising from this theoretical structure is that the direct cost elasticity
with respect to Kg (used to reflect the productivity impact of infrastructure
in a number of studies) will exaggerate the social impact of public capital
investment since the analysis neglects the social costs of such investment.

In addition, the importance of the relative growth rates of infrastructure and

output is ignored. On the other hand, the harm in terms of productive
performance resulting from investment falling short of output growth is also
disregarded.

This framework also shows that evaluating the contribution of public
infrastructure (as well as internal scale effects and fixity) on productivity
growth involves measuring output, cost and productivity changes over time, and
then using the cost elasticity with respect to output and its individual
elasticity components to decompose the overall measure of productive
performance. I.e •,

identifying

the infrastructure impacts requires computing

the shadow value of infrastructure capital, ZKg the shadow share S*Kg, the
imputed long run elasticity of Kg demand with respect to output changes, KgY'
and the resulting direct and indirect contributions to productive performance

SKg•(dlfl Kg/dt) and £KgyS*Kg(dln Y/dt).

-14-

Estimation of the elasticities and shadow values is, however, not

possible using a nonparametric index number methodology; it requires a

parametric framework representing the firm's technology. The production
theory structure outlined in the previous subsection is ideal for such an
analysis of infrastructure contributions to productive performance, since
empirical implementation of this framework allows direct calculation of the
required elasticities.

III. Empirical Implementation
Computing the measures developed in the previous section requires

assuming a specific functional form for the variable cost function C(s), to

use as a basis for representation of the firm's pattern of responses. The
functional form used in this paper is a generalized Leontief (CL) variable
cost function incorporating nonconstant returns to scale and fixed inputs,
developed in Morrison [1988], which can be expressed as:

full range of

substitution possibilities, and thus is a more desirable representation of
technology and behavior than restricted functions like the Cobb-Douglas used
by many researchers studying the impacts of public capital

expenditures.8

Estimation of the parameters of C(s) allows computation of the
elasticity measures required for analysis of infrastructure's contribution to

terms to stabilize the results. In addition, although the CL functional form
does not contain intercepts for the cost and thus the pricing equation, fixedeffect intercepts were initially added to (8) to assess the sensitivity of the
results to the pooling process. Since the parameters on the pricing equation
were uniformly insignificant (and not theoretically justified in terms of the
construction of the CL functional form), they were dropped for the final
specifications.

graciously provided by Alicia Munnell)' The remaining input and price data
were primarily obtained from the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM). Further
information on the construction of the data is provided in Appendix A.
Seemingly unrelated (STiR) systems techniques were used for estimation,

since the estimating system is not simultaneous. Three stage least squares
(THSLS) was also used in preliminary computations, in order to instrument

output levels and input prices for possible endogeneity, but the results were
sensitive to the construction of the instruments, and were more volatile and
less robust to specification changes than those based on STiR methods.

Based on the resulting estimated parameters, the production
characteristics identified in the previous section as determinants of observed
economic performance (such as shadow values and scale measures) were measured

by direct calculation of the required derivatives. Standard and adjusted
productivity growth measures were generated using index number procedures.
These indicators of productive performance and infrastructure effects were
measured for each state, as well as for an Maverage stateN for each region.

The averaging process involved constructing a weighted average for each input
and output price and quantity, and generating a "weighted average coefficient"

for parameters augmented by dummies. These measures are reported and
summarized in the next section.

The Results
Results from estimation of the system of equations given by (7) and (8)

suggest that our approach has great promise for evaluating the infrastructure

augment efficiency, is included.

effects on economic performance. The results generated were quite robust, and
indicators constructed from the estimated parameters were of the correct sign,

and of reasonable magnitudes. This was especially true

for

specifications

including the breakdown of labor and energy inputs used for our analysis, and
when pooled cross-section time-series estimation techniques were used.

In particular, including energy as well as disaggregating the labor

input seem crucial for generating reasonable values. The breakdown of
variable inputs turned out to be a considerable improvement over the basic

value added (KpKgL) specification which we used for preliminary
investigation, and which has generally provided the basis for studies of
infrastructure inipacts.12 R2s for the estimated models for all regions were

much

higher

than for the more restricted input specification; in our final

model the R2s for the estimating equations were all greater than .90, and most

exceeded .98. In addition, curvature conditions were satisfied throughout for
variable and quasi-fixed inputs. Finally, the magnitudes of the estimated
elasticities were all very plausible.13

The results were also quite robust to changes in specification (such as
using different starting values, constraining parameters to be zero, and
trying different pooling procedures), although pooling parameters representing

fixed effects were required (they were almost invariably significant))4

impact by restricting terms on the "t" values to zero (since they tended to be

individually insignificant), were rejected. Imposing a zero cross KgY term,
however, stabilized results for all regions. This might be interpreted as

that some heteroskedasticity problems remain when pooling states with

very different output levels)5
Overall, the intuitive and theoretical plausibility of the

results

support the use of our model and data for assessing the impact of

infrastructure across states. The indicators constructed from these
estimates, based on our theoretical development in Section II, also provide a

rich structure for evaluation of these impacts. As a foundation for analyzing
these indicators, it is useful first to briefly consider variations in the
patterns of infrastructure investment across the different regions.

Table 1 documents the availability of public capital in the four
regions, in terms of ratios of Kg to both private capital and output for
selected years, plus the average over the entire time period and the average

'5The most obvious effect of this constraint was in the western region, where
it resulted in more reasonable estimates (which were also more consistent with
individual state and pooled pacific region estimates) for California. This was
less evident in other regions where the difference in output levels across
states was not as dramatic.

annual growth rates for each region. These ratios suggest that the "sunbelt"
(the South and West as defined by Hulten and Schwab [1984J,[199l]) has more

public capital relative to both private capital and to output than do the
"snowbelt" (North and East) states.

The main change in this pattern over time has been in the South, where
private capital investment has been very substantial relative to both public
capital and output growth,

than

causing the Kg/Kp ratio to drop to a lower level

for any other region by the end of the sample period. The West has a

greater proportion of public capital than the other regions, which might be

expected since these states are less dense in terms of population and

manufacturing establishments compared to their land mass. However, even
though all regions have decreasing public to private capital ratios over time,

the West has experienced the greatest decline. In addition, the North and
East are very similar, especially in their Kg/Y ratios.

Table 2 provides additional information about the growth rates of public
and private capital and output, which

will

have important impacts on the

productivity adjustments. These numbers show much greater volatility in
output than private capital growth, and in private than public capital growth.
However, there has been a downward trend in infrastructure investment
everywhere, which even turns to a decline in the stock for 1983-84 in the East
when investment did not even keep up with depreciation.

The averages highlight that output growth has been largest in the West
and South, although investment in private capital has surpassed output growth

on average and that for public capital has fallen short. This is true even
for the South, which has the largest growth rate compared to other regions.

These growth rates were computed according to the continuous formula din Y/dt
to make them consistent with the methodology used for Divisia index
computations. This tends to exacerbate volatility when large changes occur.

Investigating the motivations for these patterns as well as the impact
of infrastructure investment on productive performance crucially involves the

shadow value or marginal benefit of Kg ZKgôG/ôKg. as discussed in Section
II. Indexes of these measures over time, along with the analogous shadow
value of private capital, are presented by region in Table 3. In all cases
the shadow value of public capital exceeds zero,'6 indicating a positive

marginal benefit or marginal product of infrastructure capital for firms. It
does, however, tend to be lower and have a smaller upward time trend than ZKP
(except in the South), suggesting a decline in the relative value of public to
private capital over time.

16This value was tested for statistical significance at two points for each
state and was uniformly significant in terms of a t-test using the estmated
standard error.

These relative values convey some interesting information since the

patterns vary significantly across regions. For the East, the ZKg value goes
from about 75% of the ZKP value to less than half. In the North, the ratio is

quite flat at about 30%. In the South it "flips" from below to above one
--

it goes from 80% to 250% --

and in the West it rises from about 1/3 to 1/2.

Thus, in the snowbelt, the Zj/Zgp ratio is dropping, and in the sunbelt the
ratio is increasing -

- in

the South to significantly greater than one. This

suggests possible overinvestment by firms in private capital relative to
public capital, especially in the South.
Combining this information with that provided in the first two tables

supports this implication and suggests other interesting conjectures. For
example, The lower Kg investment in the North and East as compared to the West
and South seems to have been appropriate in light of the lover shadow values

in these regions. It appears that infrastructure investment should be
stimulated further in the South, even though the growth rates for Kg in this

region are already relatively large. In reverse, investment in private
capital appears to have been higher than optimal -.
the snowbelt region --

for

at

least with respect to

the West and particularly for the South. It seems,

in fact, that private investment in the South has likely been too extensive in
terms of its true marginal product.

To pursue this further, it is necessary to translate this discussion of

relative stock valuation to one in "reaP terms. This may be accomplished by
comparing the shadow values of these stocks to their market prices. Since the
shadow value measures are essentially measured in nominal dollars, doing this
type of comparison facilitates appropriate interpretation and inference of

motivation and optimality. This is particularly important since both the
relative prices and efficiencies of the two types of capital differ, and also
since the appropriate price at which to evaluate Kg is somewhat unclear.

-23-

More specifically, for private capital a unitless measure of the
is often constructed by specifying the shadow

marginal contribution of

value as a ratio, in the form of a Tobin's q measure; qK_ZK/PK. This
measure equals one in equilibrium if PKp appropriately measures the user cost
of private capital, since ZKp represents the marginal benefit and PKp the

marginal cost of 5. If instantaneous adjustment were possible the firm would
demand capital to its "desiredTM level where these two values were equated.

For purposes of comparison, therefore, a measure of PKp is provided in

Table 4; construction of this measure is elaborated in Appendix A. From this
measure it appears that private capital has been chronically overutilized in
the East and North; more capital would have paid off since marginal benefits

exceed marginal costs. This is also generally true for the West, except in
the early 1980s. However, for the South over-investment (excess capacity)
appears pervasive; a Kp measure would fall increasingly short of one.

This type of comparison is trickier to carry out for Kgi since PKg0 in

terms of private optimization but not for society as a whole. For PKg° the
Kg measure is undefined, but it is invariably true that ZKg>PKB. As long as
the marginal product is positive firms benefit from having more Kg.
For social evaluation, however, ZKg can be interpreted in the context of

a Kg measure. Essentially, the idea underlying construction of the

measure is that if q>l the firm has an incentive to invest in K.

Similar

reasoning implies that if the social cost of investing in one more unit

of

public capital is less than Z1(, the expenditure by the state is justified

in

terms of the net benefits. The issue that arises in this case is how to
measure the one-period social price of public infrastructure capital.17
The two main differences between PKg and PKp involve the differential
cost of funds and the effective tax rates for public and private expenditure.
Specifically, PKp is computed using a deflator for capital plant and equipment
(p1) to reflect inflation in investment prices, and adapting this into a user

cost by taking depreciation (6) the cost of funds (rt), and tax rates (TXt)
into account according to the formula pKP_TXpI(rt+6t). To accomodate
differences in the cost of funds, r may be approximated by the Moody Baa bond
yield for private investment, but the Moody government bond yield for public

investment. In addition, expenditures on public infrastructure are not
subject to corporate taxation, so the tax rate adjustment may be ignored for

public spending. The resulting measure of PKg' which is similar to that used
in Berndt and Hansson (1991], is presented in Table 4.

17Note that this evaluation of "social" benefits only pertains to the benefit
to manufacturing firms of investment in Kg. ignoring the benefits to
individuals and other types of businesses. In addition, part of the social
user cost of the marginal unit of infrastructure is covered by the private cost
associated with funding these projects through taxation. The complications
associated with this "halfway house" are neglected here.

25-

These values suggest that, although the ZKg values are lower than those
for ZKp. much of this difference in terms of optimality results from the

differentiation in user cost. In fact, it appears that infrastructure
investment has almost invariably been too low for social optimization;

ZKg>PKE. This is especially true for the South in the later part of the
sample. For other regions, surprisingly, the ZKg and PKg measures are
converging; although the net returns to infrastructure investment are positive,
observed lower growth rates in Kg over time may have been justifiable.

Further assessment of the cost and ultimately productivity impacts of Kg
can be accomplished by calculating the shadow share of Kg (s*Kg) and the long
run scale elasticity with respect to infrastructure (EKgY). and using these
values to compute the direct and indirect contributions to productivity
growth, S*Kg•(dln Kg/dt) and cKgys*K8(d]fl Y/dt), as discussed in Section II.
The shadow shares presented in Table 5 range from about .15 to .3.

These indexes have at least two useful interpretations. Since this share is
computed as a ratio of the marginal valuation of the public capital stock
(ZKgKg) and the total private cost (C—G(•)+PKPKI,). these numbers suggest that

the public capital stock is worth from 15% to one-third of the firm's cost of

production. This implies quite a large productive (cost-saving) benefit of
additional units of infrastructure capital, which is statistically significant
(since the shadow value is significantly different from zero).
These values are substantially larger in the sunbelt areas of the West

and particularly the South (about 20-30%) than in the snowbelt regions (about
15-20%). Also, the shadow shares dropped during the early l980s in the East
and North and stayed somewhat low in the East, but declined very little if at

all and had a generally upward trend in the South and West. This supports the
earlier assertion that the incentive for infrastructure investment has been
constant or dropping (although is generally positive) in the North-East but is
relatively strong and increasing in the South-West.

Recognizing that the shadow share measure has been derived from the cost

elasticity with respect to public capital (ckgaln C/3m Kg) facilitates
comparison of these values with those found in other studies)-8 Our estimates
of the shadow shares are smaller than the comparable values of the cost and
thus productivity effect of Kg investment estimated by Munnell (1990] and
especially Aschauer (1989] (using simple production function models), similar
to those found by Nadiri and Mamuneas [1991] and Berndt and Hansson [1991]
(with cost function approaches based on individual manufacturing industries
for the entire U.S. and Swedish manufacturing, respectively), and larger than
those computed by researchers such as Hulten and Schwab (1991) (using index
number methods).

Note that our measure does not include "other" public capital. Since
this component of infrastructure tends to depress the cost impact, including

it would likely generate somewhat smaller values of S*Kg. Even so, since our
measures lie in the middle to upper range of the values found in these studies
and are quite robust, this suggests that both the very large and the
negligible values found by studies using simpler methods are questionable.

The more structural model developed in this paper, however, not only
generates reasonable results, but also provides theoretical and empirical

information that facilitates interpretation of the measures. First, the
shadow value shares identify the direct effect on manufacturing firms, but do
not reflect the cost of infrastructure capital, which confuses the inference

about social optimality. In particular, 3m C/3m KgZKgKg/C_S*Kg only if
if the cost of Kg were taken into account in the cost computation this

would instead be öln C/ôln Kg(PKgZKg)/CECkg.

is also closely related to the output elasticity from the production
function measured by researchers such as Hulten [1991) since the marginal
product and shadow value are closely related - - they are essentially dual to
each other.

-28-

Also, the impact of this cost effect on productivity growth depends on

the growth rate of investment, not just the share. The direct productivity
effect K8DIR

S*Kg (din K8/dt) will be zero even with a high S*Kg if K8 is

not changing. Since Kg growth has generally been positive but declining, this
will have a depressing effect on the productive contribution of infrastructure
Investment over time even for the South and West which have high and
increasing shadow shares.

Thirdly, the theoretical development in Section II also showed that if
Kg has a scale effect for firms, an additional indirect effect of Kg growth

emerges from the terni EK8yS*Kgs(dln Y/dt). This highlights that not only the
price of Kg and the growth of Kg affect net costs and observed productivity
from expenditures on public infrastructure, but the relative growth rates of

K8 and output production also make a difference. For example, since output
growth has on average been higher than Kg growth in the South and West and
similar or lower in the North and East, this exacerbates the evidence that K8
growth has been insufficient (even If relatively large) in the sunbelt.

To accomodate the first issue, we can consider the CKg measure in
Table 5, which takes into account the social cost of infrastructure

Investment)9 These numbers are primarily positive, although for the East,
North and even the West the early 1980s are negative. This suggests that even
socially the net benefits of additional public infrastructure investment would

generally have been positive over this time period. However, It also supports
the notion that observed sluggish public capital Investment in the l980s was
at least somewhat justified when net costs are taken into account.

In addition, the scale effect of K8 may be ascertained by the elasticity

KgY' also presented in Table 5. EK8Y reflects the Nretusw to K8 as output

19We measure this as the negative of the elasticity to Indicate net benefits as
a positive number.

-29-

changes; if the desired level of Kg increases more (less) than proportionately

with increases in Y this measure will be greater (less) than one. The
measures in Table 5 show that EKgY exceeds one in the sunbelt and varies, with
a mean of greater than one, in the snowbelt.

Decreasing returns to Kg in the long run therefore seem pervasive; a

higher proportion of Kg is desirable as output increases. Thus, output
expansion in the South-West exerts increasing pressure on the existing

infrastructure and motivates further expansion of public infrastructure. This
is less so in the East and particularly in the North, although such a tendency

is weakly evident. This augments the indirect effect; it suggests that the
comparison of output and Kg growth is even more powerful in terms of the

productivity impact. Growth in public infrastructure must

than keep up

with output growth in order to have a postive productivity impact.
We can further pursue these implications about infrastructure effects by
considering the direct and indirect infrastructure contributions presented in

Table 6, which result from combining these measures. To facilitate
interpretation of these measures, it is useful to refer to equation (5'),
reproduced here in its expanded form and collecting the Kg effects to
highlight the total effect:

Thus, if S*Kg>O the direct productivity impact of infrastructure investment is
positive, but the net effect will only be positive if the augmented output

growth measure cgy(dln Y/dt) is growing less rapidly than Kg. Alternatively,
we can interpret this impact more along the lines of equation (5) where the
roles of

and ETCt are reversed. If the last term of (5'') is positive,

standard productivity growth measures overestimate true technical change since
some of the measured productivity growth may be attributed to infrastructure

investment. Conversely, if this is negative, standard productivity growth
measures as representative of technical change are biased downwards.

Expression (5'') shows clearly that the KDIR and KgIND measures can be
interpreted as the percentage impact on the productivity growth rate. The
positive values for essentially all the K8DIR values reported in Table 6,
therefore, indicate a positive productivity impact of infrastructure
investment which ranges between .192% (for the North) to .622% (for the South)

on average. The decline in these values over time, especially for the North
and East (from .843% to .177% in the East, for example, with negative values
for 1983-84), suggests that the positive infrastructure investment impacts

have been reduced due to lower growth rates of Kg. However, for the East (and
also somewhat for the North), this is due also to lower returns to
infrastructure investment, as reflected in the fall of the S*Kg values.
The net effect is the sum of the KgDIR and KgIND measures;

NETKgDIR+KgIND. As is evident from Table 6, in many cases negative KgIND
measures counterract the positive Kg values so NET<O. This suggests that
sluggish productivity growth has often been due at least partly to a shortfall

of infrastructure investment relative to growth in output production. This is
especially true for the South and the West, where infrastructure investment
has simply not kept up with output expansion.

-32-

The averages emphasize this difference between the sunbelt and snowbelt;
productivity growth has been augmented by .15- .25% in the snowbelt and

depressed by from .8% to almost 1% per year in the sunbelt by low

infrastructure investment. Firms have been unable to take advantage of
potential scale effects arising from public infrastructure investment.

To further clarify how these effects support or counterract each other
in terms of productivity growth, it is useful to examine the patterns of these
effects at times when different Kg and Y growth rate patterns are observed.
For example, if Y is increasing as Kg is declining (see 1983-84 for the East),
both the direct and indirect impacts are negative; productivity growth is
harmed by the stagnation of the existing infrastructure, and this damage is

heightened by the fact that output is growing at the same time. In reverse,
when the stock of infrastructure is increasing but output production is in a
downturn, both these impacts are positive. Thus, in a recessionary period.
both the direct and indirect impacts of positive infrastructure investment
augment productivity growth.

If both are increasing or decreasing, however, the net effect depends on

which is changing most rapidly. If both are increasing, for example, the
direct effect is positive but the indirect is negative; only if Kg is
increasing at a greater rate than the adjusted growth rate of output
EKgY(dlfl Y/dt) will the productivity growth impact be positive. This was the

case in 1974 for the East, whereas the reverse occurred in 1976; productivity
growth was hampered because output growth was not met by a corresponding
increase in Kg.

It is useful also to consider the converse interpretation of these

measures. I.e., when the NET effect is to reduce productivity growth from
what it would have been if Kg investment had kept up with expanding

production, the traditional productivity growth measure (ct)

is

low. Thus,

-33-

the adjusted measure TCt reflecting only technical change is greater. Since
this situation occurs when output expansion is large relative to Kg growth, it
is likely to be observed when productivity already is high, and vice-versa.

Thus, the adjusted productivity measure will likely fluctuate more than
the standard measure; taking infrastructure into account is unlikely to smooth

cycles in technical change measures. This is evident from the Appendix Table
B4, where the traditional and adjusted productivity growth measures allowing

for both private and public capital effects are presented.2° However, the
secular trends show that infrastructure investment declines make it
increasingly likely that Kg growth will be lower than growth in output
production, harming productivity growth; true technical change will be greater
than that measured using standard measurement procedures because some of the
decline can be "explained" by a shortfall in public infrastructure investment.

V. Concluding Remarks
Declines in the cost of producing a particular output level (given
constant input prices), represent an increase in productive performance of

firms. These declines may, however, result from numerous types of efficiency
changes, including not only technical change but also different types of scale

effects. These scale effects, in turn, may arise from short run fixities of
inputs, scale economies iinbedded in the technology, or external impacts such

as public infrastructure. In this paper we have modeled and measured the
impacts of these effects on costs and thus on productivity, focusing on the
impacts of public infrastructure investment in highways, water and sewers.

20Note that the productivity growth numbers fluctuate more decisively than many
multifactor measures, since this is essentially a value added measure (energy
is a small proportion of these costs). Also, Table B5 shows the full
decomposition into the different Kg and K effects from equation (5'').

-34-

Our
firms'

results

costs

indicate the importance of infrastructure investment to

and productivity growth, and highlight the usefulness of a full

structural model for both measuring and interpreting these impacts. In
particular, we are able to measure the cost impact of infrastructure
investment as a shadow value, using a representation of firms' technology and

cost minimization behavior based on a variable cost function. We are able to
pursue this further, however, to consider how private and social net benefits
will differ according to the price of infrastructure investment incurred by

the firms as compared to the government. We also show that indirect impacts
also affect net benefits through the relative rates of growth of output and
public infrastructure.

The direct cost impact of infrastructure investment appears to be quite

extensive, although not as great as found by some researchers. The shadow
share, reflecting the proportional cost savings compared to costs, ranges
primarily from 15% to 20% for the hssnowbeltu (North and East) states and from

20 to 30% in the "sunbelt (South and West), with the values generally
increasing for the latter regions and declining slightly or staying flat in

the North-East. Increasing the stock of infrastructure thus has a
significantly positive impact in terms of increasing the efficiency
(decreasing costs) of production.

Recognizing the public cost of such expenditure implies a lower net
value, represented by the cost elasticity ECKg —

aln

C/3m Kg including a

price of public infrastructure capital (where Kg denotes this capital). This
value is smaller than the shadow share, but remains positive throughout most
of the time period and the regions (except the early 1980s in the East, North
and West), since the shadow value is generally greater than the cost of

capital. Thus, the net social as well as the private benefit of additional
infrastructure investment is positive on average.

-35-

Computing the direct productivity growth impact from this information
requires multiplying the shadow value measure by the growth in public

infrastructure. This adaptation causes the declines in the marginal
infrastructure benefits to be exacerbated in the North and East, and the

benefits to show a somewhat declining trend in the South and West. Slowdowns
in infrastructure investment have therefore reduced the positive productivity
growth impacts of such investment., even in the South where investment has been
quite extensive.

However, adapting this to take into account the importance of the
relative growth rates of output and Kg -

- including

the "indirect" impact - -

shows that shortfalls in infrastructure investment in terms of "keeping up"
with output growth have actually been harmful to productivity growth

(particularly in the South and Vest). Increases in public infrastructure
investment are therefore essential to generate a positive impact on
productivity growth when production is expanding; existing infrastructure
investment has not generally been sufficient to accomplish this.

In sum, there appears to be a significant incentive for investment in
public capital, especially in the south, in terms of the benefit accruing to

manufacturing firms. This is even true when the costs of infrastructure
investment are taken into account; there has been a positive net social
benefit of additional infrastructure investment for most years and regions.
This is particularly the case when output production is expanding, since
shortfalls in infrastructure investment relative to output growth appear not
only to have reduced the positive impact, but even to have proven harmful to
productivity growth due to the scale effects of public capital.

APPENDIX A: The Data
The data used for this empirical implementation are annual data on the

manufacturing sector of the 48 contiguous states for 1970 through 1987. The
18 year panel is long enough to allow the separation of short and long run
effects, and the investigation of changes in productivity and performance over

time. Although a longer time series would be preferable for our analysis, we
are effectively constrained from considering earlier or more recent data since
some critical data series begin in 1970 and post-1986 data is still
incomplete.

Although many state-level studies are based on data for gross state
product (CSP), which includes production in many sectors, we have restricted
our analysis to the manufacturing sector for two important reasons. First,
the production theory model of firm production and decision making is
particularly applicable to the production processes of manufacturing firms
compared to firms in service sectors such as banking, in which output (and
sometimes inputs) are conceptually and computationally difficult to define.
Secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, the Annual Survey of Manufactured
(ASM) provides unusually detailed data on the inputs used by manufacturing
firms, expenditures on these inputs, value added by firms and other economic

variables by state. This greater data availability has allowed us to break
down labor into production and nonproduction workers, and to consider energy
as a separate input, which are important for appropriate representation of
production processes.

This Appendix provides a description of the underlying data and sources
used for construction of the input and output price and quantity variables
used in the analysis.

-A2 -

Private

Capital

The quantity of private capital,

is measured as the end-of-year

private capital in the manufacturing sector, in 1982 dollars, with a one year

lag adjustment to transform the data to beginning-of-year stocks. These data
were generously provided on diskette by Alicia Munnell of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston.

The user cost of capital, p, is constructed according to:

Al) Kp — TXP1(r+S),
where TXt is (l+r), r is the effective rate of corporate taxation (from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics), p1 is a price deflator for capital equipment
investment, r is the rate of return to capital, and S represents the

depreciation rate.1 For this paper, r is approximated as the Moody Baa bond
yield rate. Depreciation, 5, is measured as the ratio of total annual
depreciation of equipment and structures in the national manufacturing sector
to the national stock of equipment and structures, both in constant 1982
dollars (from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) publication Fixed

Reroducib1e Tangible Wealth in the U.S.). The implicit price deflator for
the manufacturing capital stock, p, is calculated as the ratio of BEA current
and constant dollar estimates of the national manufacturing sector net
equipment and structures capital.

Note that although it would be desirable to generate state specific
estimates of the user cost of capital, the necessary data for constructing

such estimates are unavailable. Since construction of the private capital
data provided by Alicia Munnell was based on the national variables provided

1See Harper, Berndt and Wood [1989] for a detailed discussion of the user
cost of capital computation.

-A3-

in this BEA publication, however, the estimates of the stock and user cost of
capital are consistent.

Public Capital

The stock of public capital, Kg. is measured as end-of-year public
capital stock of highways, water and sewers, in 1982 dollars, with a one year

lag to reflect beginning of year stocks. This eliminates the effects of
"other public capital" measured by Munnell, which includes such capital assets
as public buildings which are less likely to affect manufacturing

productivity.2 The public capital data were also provided by Alicia Munnell.
See Munnell [1990] for a more complete description of their computation.

Labor

Two types of workers are distinguished: production and nonproduction
workers in the manufacturing sector. The ASH provides the number of full-time
and part-time employees on the payrolls of operating manufacturing
establishments, L, and the number of workers engaged in production at

operating manufacturing establishments, Lv). The number of nonproduction

workers is found as the difference between these, L-L—L. Since data on
hours worked is not available for nonproduction workers, employment data was
used for both types of workers for conformability and comparability.3
In addition, the ASH reports gross earnings (wage bill) of all employees
2Estimates using both total public capital and total public capital less
OTHPK were constructed. Including OTHPK tended to reduce the shadow value
of public capital, suggesting that additional investment tends to be harmful
rather than helpful to manufacturing establishments. These effects were
small, however, and appeared to be statistically insignificant from carrying
out estimation decomposing the public capital into its two components and
considering them separately.
3Unfortunately, the ASM suspended the collection and reporting of these data
for 1979-81. The 1978 and 1982 data were interpolated to estimate values
for the missing years

-A4 -

(PQL) and of production workers (PQP) on the payroll of operating
manufacturing establishments paid in a calendar year. Gross earnings of
nonproduction workers is found as the difference between these: PQN—PQL-PQP.
Finally, for each category of worker, wage bill per worker is found as
the ratio of gross earnings to the number of employees (pLP—PQP/LP.
pth—PQN/Ln).

Energy

The ASM reports total expenditures on fuels and electricity used for

heat and power in the manufacturing sector (PQE).4 The price of energy used
is the cost per million BTTJs of purchased fuels and electricity in the

industrial sector from State Price and Expenditure Report, published by the

Energy Information Administration (PE' and augmented by data from their
system. The estimated quantity of energy was therefore constructed as the
ratio of total energy expenditure to the price of energy (PQE/pE).

Output

The price of output, Py. was measured as the implicit price deflator for
Gross State Product (GSP). computed for each state as the ratio of BEA current
and constant dollar estimates of GSP. Our measure of output net of non-energy materials -

- gross

output

- was computed by deflating value added reported

by the ASM by Py (PQVA/pyVA) and adding back constant dollar expenditures on
fuels and electricity (Y—VA+E).

4Total expenditures were interpolated from 1966 and 1972 data for 1970 and
1971.
