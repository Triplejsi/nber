FORWARD INTO THE PAST: PRODUCTIVITY RETROGRESSION
IN THE ELECTRIC GENERATING INDUSTRY

ABSTRACT
The electric utility industry is a prime culprit in the U.S. productivity growth slowdown of the
last two decades. This paper develops econometric labor and fuel demand equations for a large panel
data set covering almost ail fossil-fueled electric generating capacity over the period 1948-87. Labor

The research goes beyond econometric estimation by conducting a set of telephone interviews
with plant managers of establishments that registered particulariy high or low productivity. The
interviews reveal many variables and relations that are omitted in conventional econometric studies of
01/92

production. They support the view that the productivity reversal originated in the manufacturing
industry that produces electric generating equipment; after decades of increased scale, temperature, and

pressure, a "technological frontier" was reached in which new large plants developed unanticipated
maintenance problems requiring substantial additions of maintenance employees. Environmental
regulations also contributed to the productivity reversal but were secondary in importance to the
technological barriers. Overall, the study supports the "depletion hypothesis' previously advanced to
explain the productivity slowdown.

I. INTRODUCTION
The worldwide slowdown in productivity growth since the early 1970s has continued

to puzzle economists. The failure to identi' any convincing single cause has led to a shift

in research away from aggregate studies toward more detailed research at the industry
level.1 Along with construction and mining, the electric utility industry is one of three U. S.

industries that have suffered the sharpest deceleration of productivity growth and thus is a
natural candidate for detailed study.
Three special advantages commend the electric utility industry for analysis. First, its

output. Second, as a regulated industry, the production process of electric utility generation

is documented in an unusually detailed body of micro data at the establishment level.

single-cause theories of the aggregate productivity slowdown, including those that emphasize

the role of energy prices, capital accumulation, environmental regulation, and the "depletion"
of technology.

This paper provides new estimates of factor demand equations for labor and fuel use

at the establishment level for fossil-fueled steam-electric generating plants, using a data set
that has been newly developed for this study. It attempts to link the results to three strands

of literature that have developed largely in isolation, (1) the macro-oriented literature on
the economywide productivity slowdown, (2) the industrial organization literature on public

1. Among the single-cause explanations for the aggregate economy are higher energy prices (Rasche-Tatom,
1981), high raw materials prices (Bruno-Sachs, 1985), slower capital accumulation (Norsworthy, Harper, Kunze,

1979), a decline in capital services relative to the measured capital stock (Baily, 1981), and depletion of
resources and ideas (Nordhaus, 1980, 1982). Others, including Edward Denizen (1985), tend to attribute the
slowdown to a multitude of causes.

II. ELECTRICITY GENERATION IN THE CONTEXT
OF THE ECONOMYWIDE PRODUCTIVITY SLOWDOWN
The electric utility industxy is a prime culprit in the economywide post-1973
productivity growth slowdown. As shown in Table 1, growth in labor productivity (output

per hour) in the electric utility industry proceeded at a rate triple that of the aggregate
economy from 1899 to 1948, and at a rate 2.5 times as fast from 1948 to 1973. After 1973,
however, the previously rapid rate of advance for electric utilities caine screeching to a halt,

as productivity growth slowed to the same low rate as experienced by the aggregate
economy.

Table 1 also displays the growth rate of the real price of electricity over the same
time intervals. Here the rate of improvement decelerated sharply immediately after World

War II, and the historical decline in the real price was replaced by an increase after 1973.

between 1953 and 1973, almost ceased between 1973 and 1983, and then revived after 1983.

The slowdown in labor productivity growth in the sector began earlier than that of output,
and productivity growth was actually negative on average between 1973 and 1983, followed

by a revival during 1983-88. Productivity growth for electric utilities in column (4) displays
roughly the same pattern as for the utility sector in column (3). The final column shows that
the period of rapid productivity growth coincided with that of a decline in the relative price
of electricity, and the poor productivity decade of 1973-83 coincided with the period of most

rapid increase in the relative price of electricity.

Scope of the Study
This paper limits its attention to the production of electricity in steam plants using
fossil fuels. Electricity makes up about 70 percent of the "electricity, gas, and sanitary
services" industry aggregate in the NIPA, fossil-fuel steam accounts for almost three-quarters

of electricity generation (the rest is mainly hydro and nuclear), and employees involved in

generation make up about one-third of all employees on the payrolls of electric utilities.
Despite the relatively small fraction of total utility employment covered, the industry

segment analyzed in this paper has experienced a slowdown in productivity growth very
similar to that of the utility industry aggregate, as shown in Table 3. Here growth rates are

computed over intervals between three-year averages of levels to smooth year-to-year
variation in our sample of plants. Productivity growth in our sample of generating plants

decelerates somewhat faster than the BLS index for the electric utility industry through
1978-80 but was almost identical to the BLS index in the last interval through 1985-87.

Limitations

B. Predicted

regressions cover an extremely small fraction of U. S. employment and bear on only a smnll

fraction of the total U. S. productivity growth puzzle. A second qualification is that the
electric utility industry has entered a relatively "mature" phase of the industry growth cycle,

and thus it may not be surprising that its productivity growth would decline over time.

Characteristics of the Technology
Although electric utilities are monopolists in the local markets they serve, the
aggregate number of these individual monopolies is substantial, in contrast to the very small

number of major producers of generating equipment. Thus utilities can accurately be
described as price takers in the market for new equipment, and they also are 'quality takers

in the sense that their choice set is constrained by whatever price-quality combinations are

offered by equipment manufactures on the market at any given time. Research and
development expenditures have taken place largely in the manufacturing sector, not in the

(1)

Thus the higher the heat rate, the more fuel is being consumed in the production of a given
amount of electricity, and the less efficient is the generation process. The heat rate moves
inversely to a companion ratio called "thermal efficiency."

2. This verdict is qualified by Hirsch (1989, p.71), who argues that 'to explain progress in electric power
technològy simply as a result of research and development performed by manufacturers would be one-sided and
misleadin&" The other side of technical advance is achieved by utility management, 67 percent of which in 1964
consisted of trained engineers. Managers in particular companiesperceived themselves ascompeting for the role
of technological leadership and constantly pressed equipment manufacturers to achieve technical advances, taking
the risk that unproved technology would be successfuL However, this role of management is not counted as
research and development (R&D) by normal accounting methods, and Hirsch himself reports that utility-funded
R&D in 1970 amounted to only 0.23 percent of gross revenues.

interdependent with improved thermal efficiency, since many of the efficiency improvements

required greater capital expenditures, the expense of which could be partially offset by
increased scale.3 Cowing (1970) has dubbed this interaction between increasing scale and

3. Engineers use a 'six-tenth? rule for approximating the additional cost of a capacity increase, je., a one
percent increase in capacity increases capital cost by 0.6 percent, reflecting the geometrical fact that a one
percent increase in the volume of a sphere increases its surface area by about 0.6 percent (Moore, 1959).

technical improvements 'scale augmenting technical change.'4
The end of the era of increasing size helps to explain the productivity slowdown, and

primarily been technological advance or the increasing size of the market. The technological hypothesis emphasizes the incremental advance of technology toward a technical ceiling

reached in the late 1960s, at the beginning of the slowdown period. In contrast the market
hypothesis stresses the role of higher energy prices in the 1970s in reducing the growth in
demand for electricity, and predicts that further advances in scale should resume in response

to the post-1983 decline in the real price of electricity.
One way to distinguish the two hypotheses is to ask why generator units were so small

in the early part of the postwar period. Either manufacturers did not have the technical
competence to produce larger units at reasonable cost, or markets were too small to support

the purchase of larger units. One indirect piece of evidence that supports the technological
explanation is that the average number of units installed per newly constructed plant during

increase beyond 250 megawatts. Indeed, after increasing from 3 percent in 1880 to 22 percent in 1947, thermal
efficiency leveled off at about 33 percent in the late 1950s and showed no change after than (Hirsch, 1989, Figure

required increased downtime for maintenance, and this in turn coùtributed to lower

The last component of the new technological era involved not just hitting a
technological wail but rather amounted to a full-fledged retreat. Design-by-extrapolation

led to the development in the late 1950s and early 1960s of the supercritical" boiler
(achieving a pressure above 3200 p.s.i.). However, after reaching a 63 percent share in new
installations during 1970-74, the share fell to 6 percent in 198 1-82 (Joskow-Rose, 1985, Table

1, p. 4). The backing off from supercritical technology resulted mainly from unanticipated

maintenance problems, documented in the interviews at the end of this paper.8

The arrival of a technological frontier interacted with the pitfalls of the design-by-

extrapolation approach, which downgraded the importance of waiting for experience to

could have been alleviated with a more cautious approach, e.g., stability problems with

Joskow-Rose (1985, p. 23) report that average equipment availability over the 1969-80 period ranged from
82.8 percent for units of 100 MW to only 62.6 percent for units of 900 MW.

The interviewa contained in an early draft of this paper are cited as an explanation of the abandonment
of supercritical units by HIrsch (1989, pp. 97-9) and Joskow-Rosc (1985, p.23). Note that the Joskow-Roac
evidence suggests that the availability penalty of supercritical units of given size is less than the penalty of
increasing the size of subcritical units from 500 to 900 MW.

A timing argument exempts environmental regulation from any appreciable blame

in this technological history. Unanticipated problems developed in a major way with
equipment manufactured in the early 1960s, yet the response of utilities to environmental
regulation is usually dated from the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 (Goilop-Roberts,

1983, p. 654). Yet as the 1970s evolved, environmental regulation played a growing role in
the slowdown in labor productivity growth and decline in thermal efficiency experienced by

utilities, as regulations induced a shift away from soft coal, required major capital
expenditures for scrubbers and other devices, and substantially raised the requirement for

maintenance employees. Thus productivity growth was impeded after the early 1970s by

both the technological plateau and by environmental regulation, introducing a serious
identification problem for any study attempting to explain the productivity growth slowdown.

percent for equipment shipped in 1965.69 to 2 percent in 1975-80 to 0.5 percent in 1980-84.

This section of the paper specifies a regression equation in which plant employment

decrease rapidly relative to the corresponding NIPA indexes through the late 1960s and rise much faster

The earlier studies are surveyed by Cowing and Smith (1978).

Among these studies are Atkinson and Halvorsen (1984), Gollop and Roberts (1981, 1983), Cowing.
Small and Stevenson (1981), and Christensen and Greene (1976). The advantages of plant over &m data are

discussed by Cowing and Smith (1978), pp. 175.7, with reference to the papers by Nerlove (1963) and
Christensen-Greene (1976). A dissenting opinion is offered by Gollop-Roberts (1981, p. 120), who argue that
"producers make input decisions on the basis of technical and market conditions facing the complete system, not

isolated plants.' However, when plant data are available, there is no reason to make this choie ex ante, as
aggregation issues can be studied explicitly by estimating firm and establishment effects, as in Table 12 below.

which stands for a set of eight overlapping

dummy variables for year of observation, in contrast to the linear time trend (7') imposed
in (2).14 The Bushe equation omits vintage effects and instead uses design data to divide

up the total sample into seven technically homogeneous cells, and the coefficients in
equation (4) are separately for each cell. The log-linear functional form of our specification

(2) is shared with (4). In contrast, in (3) Wills begins with a linear form but allows for
interaction effects and normalizes by capacity. Bushe also implicitly normalizes by capacity,

since the average capacity within his seven separate cells differs by several orders of
magnitude.
A basic difference between the three specifications is the allowance for both time and

vintage effects in (2), only vintage effects in (3) and only "cell' effects in (4). The vintage
variable is included in (2) but not in (3), because the latter includes observations only for
newly installed plants, whereas the former includes observations for each year of operation.

The negative coefficient on capacity implies that the well-documented economies of

scale in equipment cost and labor use extend to fuel use as well. The negative coefficient
on utilization could indicate both that plants which experience a lot of downtime are also
inefficient users of fuel, and that fuel is wasted when plants are shut down for maintenance

and then started up again. The relative price term has the expected negative sign and is
much larger for coal than noncoal plants. As would be expected, plants which generate a

The elasticity óf employment to capacity changes is 034, confirming the substantial
economies to scale found in previous studies.n The elasticity of employment to utilization

is 0.12, indicating that labor requirements fluctuate only modestly in response to demand
changes, and thus that labor productivity is highly sensitive to changes in utili,ntion. Taken
by itself this coefficient suggests that labor productivity should have declined in the 1970s

in response to decreasing average utilization (shown in Table 4).

The coefficient on the heat rate residual is positive, suggesting that plants having

relatively high energy requirements also have relatively high labor requirements. This
coefficient can be interpreted as a proxy for unmeasured design differences among plants

of new units before 1948. There are several interesting changes in the coefficients in Table

insignificant, as does the heat rate residual coefficient for coal plants. The "V" of the
vintage trends becomes steeper for both fuel types, while the "V" of the time trends becomes

flatter for both fuel types.

the vintage and time trends to be identical over the entire 1948-87 sample period. Table

"residual" in aggregate studies.
In microeconomic research on data sets that identify individual observations, e.g.,

plants or firms, a study of a mysterious phenomenon like the productivity slowdown can
benefit from direct personal or telephone contact with plant or firm representatives. Such
contact can reveal errors in data or interpretation at previous stages of a particular research

study, and can add detail to flesh Out an abstract academic conjecture, e.g., the "depletion
hypothesis."

Data sets that identify establishments and firms separately allow for a detailed
analysis of "within" establishment and "between" establishment and firm effects. This is an
unambiguous advantage of establishment data over the firm data used in many studies, and

identifies four main sources of the growth slowdown, each of which appears to have
operated with more severity than in the whole economy.
1. A sharp drop in plant utilization occurred after the late 1960s, resulting both from

the two oil shocks that raised the relative price of electricity, and from the slowdown in
output and productivity growth in the rest of the economy. Both of these factors caused the

of new units before 1948. There are several interesting changes in the coefficients in Table

7 as compared with Table 6. The utilization coefficient for noncoal plants becomes
insignificant, as does the heat rate residual coefficient for coal plants. The "V" of the
vintage trends becomes steeper for both fuel types, while the "V" of the time trends becomes

flatter for both fuel types.

the vintage and time trends to be identical over the entire 1948-87 sample period. Table

In microeconomic research on data sets that identify individual observations, e.g.,

plants or firms, a study of a mysterious phenomenon like the productivity slowdown can
benefit from direct personal or telephone contact with plant or firm representatives. Such
contact can reveal errors in data or interpretation at previous stages of a particular research

study, and can add detail to flesh Out an abstract academic conjecture, e.g., the "depletion
hypothesis."

Data sets that identify establishments and firms separately allow for a detailed
analysis of "within" establishment and "between" establishment and firm effects. This is an
unambiguous advantage of establishment data over the firm data used in many studies, and

insignificant for noncoal in both halves. The heat rate residual coefficient is significant only

in the first half for both fuel types, indicating perhaps more heterogeneity in design in the

Substantwe Results
The steam-electric utility industry experienced a much sharper slowdown in the

growth of labor productivity after 1968 than the U. S. economy as a whole. The study

identifies four main sources of the growth slowdown, each of which appears to have
operated with more severity than in the whole economy.
1. A sharp drop in plant utilization occurred after the late 1960s, resulting both from

the two oil shocks that raised the relative price of electricity, and from the slowdown in
output and productivity growth in the rest of the economy. Both of these factors caused the

growth rate of electricity demand to slacken sharply in the mid-1970s immediately after

units previously considered as separate plants. The complete data set contains 7701

which stands for a set of eight overlapping

dummy variables for year of observation, in contrast to the linear time trend (7') imposed
in (2).14 The Bushe equation omits vintage effects and instead uses design data to divide

up the total sample into seven technically homogeneous cells, and the coefficients in
equation (4) are separately for each cell. The log-linear functional form of our specification

(2) is shared with (4). In contrast, in (3) Wills begins with a linear form but allows for
interaction effects and normalizes by capacity. Bushe also implicitly normalizes by capacity,

since the average capacity within his seven separate cells differs by several orders of
magnitude.
A basic difference between the three specifications is the allowance for both time and

vintage effects in (2), only vintage effects in (3) and only "cell' effects in (4). The vintage
variable is included in (2) but not in (3), because the latter includes observations only for
newly installed plants, whereas the former includes observations for each year of operation.

discussed by Cowing and Smith (1978), pp. 175.7, with reference to the papers by Nerlove (1963) and
Christensen-Greene (1976). A dissenting opinion is offered by Gollop-Roberts (1981, p. 120), who argue that
"producers make input decisions on the basis of technical and market conditions facing the complete system, not

isolated plants.' However, when plant data are available, there is no reason to make this choie ex ante, as

A timing argument exempts environmental regulation from any appreciable blame

in this technological history. Unanticipated problems developed in a major way with

1983, p. 654). Yet as the 1970s evolved, environmental regulation played a growing role in
the slowdown in labor productivity growth and decline in thermal efficiency experienced by

utilities, as regulations induced a shift away from soft coal, required major capital
expenditures for scrubbers and other devices, and substantially raised the requirement for

maintenance employees. Thus productivity growth was impeded after the early 1970s by

both the technological plateau and by environmental regulation, introducing a serious
identification problem for any study attempting to explain the productivity growth slowdown.

The last component of the new technological era involved not just hitting a
technological wail but rather amounted to a full-fledged retreat. Design-by-extrapolation

led to the development in the late 1950s and early 1960s of the supercritical" boiler
(achieving a pressure above 3200 p.s.i.). However, after reaching a 63 percent share in new
installations during 1970-74, the share fell to 6 percent in 198 1-82 (Joskow-Rose, 1985, Table

1, p. 4). The backing off from supercritical technology resulted mainly from unanticipated

maintenance problems, documented in the interviews at the end of this paper.8

The arrival of a technological frontier interacted with the pitfalls of the design-by-

extrapolation approach, which downgraded the importance of waiting for experience to

could have been alleviated with a more cautious approach, e.g., stability problems with

Joskow-Rose (1985, p. 23) report that average equipment availability over the 1969-80 period ranged from
82.8 percent for units of 100 MW to only 62.6 percent for units of 900 MW.

The interviewa contained in an early draft of this paper are cited as an explanation of the abandonment
of supercritical units by HIrsch (1989, pp. 97-9) and Joskow-Rosc (1985, p.23). Note that the Joskow-Roac
evidence suggests that the availability penalty of supercritical units of given size is less than the penalty of
increasing the size of subcritical units from 500 to 900 MW.

technological plateau was followed by a period of debugging before the next advance
occurred. In the postwar period, spurred by the rapidly growing demand for electricity,

equipment manufacturers shifted to a more aggressive philosophy called "design-byextrapolation" in which the next advance was planned before operating experience had

technical improvements 'scale augmenting technical change.'4
The end of the era of increasing size helps to explain the productivity slowdown, and

primarily been technological advance or the increasing size of the market. The technological hypothesis emphasizes the incremental advance of technology toward a technical ceiling

reached in the late 1960s, at the beginning of the slowdown period. In contrast the market
hypothesis stresses the role of higher energy prices in the 1970s in reducing the growth in
demand for electricity, and predicts that further advances in scale should resume in response

to the post-1983 decline in the real price of electricity.
One way to distinguish the two hypotheses is to ask why generator units were so small

in the early part of the postwar period. Either manufacturers did not have the technical
competence to produce larger units at reasonable cost, or markets were too small to support

the purchase of larger units. One indirect piece of evidence that supports the technological
explanation is that the average number of units installed per newly constructed plant during

increase beyond 250 megawatts. Indeed, after increasing from 3 percent in 1880 to 22 percent in 1947, thermal
efficiency leveled off at about 33 percent in the late 1950s and showed no change after than (Hirsch, 1989, Figure

interdependent with improved thermal efficiency, since many of the efficiency improvements

required greater capital expenditures, the expense of which could be partially offset by
increased scale.3 Cowing (1970) has dubbed this interaction between increasing scale and

Thus the higher the heat rate, the more fuel is being consumed in the production of a given
amount of electricity, and the less efficient is the generation process. The heat rate moves
inversely to a companion ratio called "thermal efficiency."

2. This verdict is qualified by Hirsch (1989, p.71), who argues that 'to explain progress in electric power
technològy simply as a result of research and development performed by manufacturers would be one-sided and
misleadin&" The other side of technical advance is achieved by utility management, 67 percent of which in 1964
consisted of trained engineers. Managers in particular companiesperceived themselves ascompeting for the role
of technological leadership and constantly pressed equipment manufacturers to achieve technical advances, taking
the risk that unproved technology would be successfuL However, this role of management is not counted as
research and development (R&D) by normal accounting methods, and Hirsch himself reports that utility-funded
R&D in 1970 amounted to only 0.23 percent of gross revenues.

Characteristics of the Technology
Although electric utilities are monopolists in the local markets they serve, the
aggregate number of these individual monopolies is substantial, in contrast to the very small

number of major producers of generating equipment. Thus utilities can accurately be
described as price takers in the market for new equipment, and they also are 'quality takers

in the sense that their choice set is constrained by whatever price-quality combinations are

offered by equipment manufactures on the market at any given time. Research and
development expenditures have taken place largely in the manufacturing sector, not in the

rapid increase in the relative price of electricity.

Scope of the Study
This paper limits its attention to the production of electricity in steam plants using
fossil fuels. Electricity makes up about 70 percent of the "electricity, gas, and sanitary
services" industry aggregate in the NIPA, fossil-fuel steam accounts for almost three-quarters

of electricity generation (the rest is mainly hydro and nuclear), and employees involved in

generation make up about one-third of all employees on the payrolls of electric utilities.
Despite the relatively small fraction of total utility employment covered, the industry

segment analyzed in this paper has experienced a slowdown in productivity growth very
similar to that of the utility industry aggregate, as shown in Table 3. Here growth rates are

computed over intervals between three-year averages of levels to smooth year-to-year
variation in our sample of plants. Productivity growth in our sample of generating plants

decelerates somewhat faster than the BLS index for the electric utility industry through
1978-80 but was almost identical to the BLS index in the last interval through 1985-87.

Limitations

regressions cover an extremely small fraction of U. S. employment and bear on only a smnll

fraction of the total U. S. productivity growth puzzle. A second qualification is that the
electric utility industry has entered a relatively "mature" phase of the industry growth cycle,

and thus it may not be surprising that its productivity growth would decline over time.

The slowdown in labor productivity growth in the sector began earlier than that of output,
and productivity growth was actually negative on average between 1973 and 1983, followed

by a revival during 1983-88. Productivity growth for electric utilities in column (4) displays
roughly the same pattern as for the utility sector in column (3). The final column shows that

II. ELECTRICITY GENERATION IN THE CONTEXT
OF THE ECONOMYWIDE PRODUCTIVITY SLOWDOWN
The electric utility industxy is a prime culprit in the economywide post-1973
productivity growth slowdown. As shown in Table 1, growth in labor productivity (output

per hour) in the electric utility industry proceeded at a rate triple that of the aggregate
economy from 1899 to 1948, and at a rate 2.5 times as fast from 1948 to 1973. After 1973,
however, the previously rapid rate of advance for electric utilities caine screeching to a halt,

as productivity growth slowed to the same low rate as experienced by the aggregate
economy.
