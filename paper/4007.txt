GD?, adjusted for terms of trade shocks, and per-capita CDP growth trend
during 1960-1980. The adjusted annual growth rate of per capita CD? is from
Heston and Summers, 1988. The trend variables for per capita growth 1960-80 in
each country was computed by regressing per capita growth of CDP on a time
variable.

signed during the period 1977-87. t—-i refers to i years before, and t—j
refers to j years after.
