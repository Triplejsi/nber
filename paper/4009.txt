MICRO EVIDENCE

AUDITING THE PRODUCER PRICE INDEX:
FROM PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEVTICAL

PREPARATIONS

ABSTRACT

In this paper we focus on a mystery we uncovered while undertaking a detailed audit of the
US Bunau of Labor Sttistics

producer price index (PPI).

We summarize our puzzle as follows.

From January 1984 through December 1989. the BLS price index for SIC 28341 (pnscriplion
pharmaceutical preparations) grew at an annual rate of 9.09%. For purposes of comparison, we have
ob0incd monthly price and quanlity sales data on all prcscriptlon pha~acculical

preparation products

sold by four major US phannaccutlcal manufacturers, accounting for about 24% of lotal lnduslry
domestic sales in 1989. Using Laspcyrcs price Index construction procedures on these data that mimic
BLS methods, we fud that over the same lime period, the four-company price Index increasedLI only
6.68% per year. Finally, when we employ a Divislr price index proccdun with smoothedweights ti
incorporatesnew goodsimmediately,the aggregateprice index for thesefour firms grows a~a CPIC
of
only 6.03% per year.
Why is it that the official BLS price index grows approximately 50% more rapidly (9.09% vs.
6.03%) than the Divisia price index? That mystery Is lhc focal point of our paper.
