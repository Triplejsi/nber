ENERGY TAX CREDITS AND RESIDENTIAL CONSERVATION INVESTMENT

ABSTRACT

We model the decision to invest in residential energy conservation capital as an

irreversible investment in the face of price uncertainty. The irreversible nature of this
investment means that there is a value to waiting to invest (an option value) which helps
explain the low rate of conservation investment as a result of the residential energy tax credit.
Simulations suggest that a tax credit of the type implemented from 1978 through 1985 will
not increase conservation investment significantly.

We investigate the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of credits using data from a
panel data set of roughly 38,000 individual tax returns followed over a three year period from

1979-1981. Unlike previous work, we find that the energy tax credit is statistically significant
in explaining the probability of investing. Our estimates suggest that increasing the federal
credit by 10 percentage points would increase the percentage of households claiming the
credit from 5.7% to 7.1%.

L. Introduction
There is an extensive literature which documents that a
significant number of energy conservation investments, which by
any reasonable measure have a very high rate of return, are net

undertaken (see, for example, Williams and Ross (1980) and
Carlsmith et al (1990)). This literature in the past has argued
that a variety of market barriers, e.g. fuel price distortions,
lack of information, etc., discourage these investments1.

While many of these market barriers may exist, we believe
that an important explanation for this low rate of investment is

the uncertainty over the path of future energy prices.

Key to

this explanation is the recognition of the irreversible nature of
many home energy improvements which frequently involve structural

alteration of one's residence.

This paper develops a model of

home energy investment which formally incorporates this feature.2

We then apply this model to evaluate the effectiveness of an
energy tax credit for conservation investment along the lines of

the Residential Energy Tax Credit which was in effect from 1978
through 1985.

We first develop a set of energy price and

investment simulations based on the model to investigate how

1 Sutherland (1991) summarizes and raises objections to many of

the common market failures that are proposed to explain the
"energy paradox".

In a recent paper, Jaf fee and Stavins (1991) attempt to
incorporate many of the market barrier features described above
into an economic model.
They focus on the relative merits of
price based controls versus regulation to increase conservation

investment and do not consider irreversibility and price
uncertainty in their model.

uncertainty over future prices affects the decision to invest in
conservation capital.

We also consider how different tax

policies might affect the rate of investment. We calibrate these

simulations to aggregate data under a variety of assumptions

about the nature of stochastic prices facing investors. The
simulation results based upon the moments of the relevant price

processes replicate

the

pattern of

residential

energy

conservation investment observed in the United States during the
late 1970s and early l980s and suggest that it is unnecessary to

appeal to myriad ad hoc market failures in order to explain the

"energy paradox". Irreversibility and uncertainty alone can
explain the observed adoption rates quite well, and we view both
to be reasonable features of a model of residential conservation

investment. In order to evaluate our approach more thoroughly,

we then analyze a large data set on individual federal tax
returns in the United States over the three year period 19791981.

This data set has extensive information on energy

conservation investment made by individuals which, combined with
state level energy and weather data, allows us to investigate the

impact of conservation incentive programs on individuals'
investment decisions. Unlike previous authors, we find, as the

theory would suggest, statistically significant tax credit
effects on residential conservation investment; the size of these
effects is consistent with the predictions of the model.

In the next section we present our model of conservation
investment in the presence of price uncertainty. We then provide
2

simulation results which explore both the speed of technology
diffusion and the size of tax credit effects in our model. Some
background on conservation investment incentives at the federal
and state level precedes our empirical work.

We close with a

brief conclusion.

.L A Model

Irreversible

Energy Improvement

In this section, we sketch out a simple model of the
decision to invest in conservation measures to reduce energy
consumption.3

Key to our analysis is the assumption that the

investment in energy conservation capital is irreversible.

Typical conservation investments include ceiling and wall
insulation, storn doors and windows and caulking; the salvage

value of any of these investments is likely to be very low.

Because of this, as is well known in the literature on
irreversible decisions, there is an option value associated with

n investing which contributes to a slowdown in the rate of
investment.

Assume that the price of energy (P) varies across
individuals and time according to a geometric Brownian motion
process:

our model, in order to explore more fully the impact of

setting.

There has been a substantial literature analyzing the
diffusion of technology dating back to Griliches (1957).

A

stylized fact emerging from this literature is that the adoption

of new technologies occurs subject to an S—shaped curve4. What
is striking about the energy conservation experience in the 1970s

is the very slow rate of diffusion of new technologies. This has

led to considerable speculation that information about new
technologies has not spread sufficiently rapidly or that capital
market failures might deter investment.

on diffusion as well as a theory based on learning by doing.

Put

differently, the housing stock is

heterogeneous and there exists considerable variation in the
gains from particular energy improvements. Hence as P/K rises,

people who will reap large savings from a particular energy
conservation investment will invest first while people with lower

expected gains wait for P/K to rise further5. To illustrate the

diffusion pattern which emerges from our model, we

Assuming that

P/K follows geometric Brownian motion, we obtain estimates of a

equal to .046 and and o equal to .093.

In order to help gauge

the effect of the irreversibility assumption we also provide
simulations assuming there is no uncertainty, which drives the

option value to zero. Figure 1 presents the price process and
Figure 2 the rate of cumulative investment over a 20 year horizon

when o = 0.

The hurdle rule is the traditional Marshallian one.

figure 2 shows that investment rises dramatically with 40% of
households making conservation improvements within 5 years and
99% by 20 years.

Contrast this result with the cumulative investment in the

case where o = .093.

Figure 3 shows the price process and

figure 4 the rate of investment. The price process is started at

the same value (Pa) as in the certainty case (figure 1). With a
real discount rate of .05, b equals 1.31 and b/(b—l) equals 4.23.

With these assumptions, the rate of investment is remarkably

slow, with many intervening years of no investment at all.
Cumulative investment after 20 years is less than 5%. Note that
the price both increases and decreases over the 20 year period.
Thus there are periods of rapid investment followed by periods of
no investment which can last as long as six years.

Figure 5 shows the results of a set of 500 replications of
8

the price process and cumulative investment under uncertainty.

The trend and variance of the price process is the same in the
replications, matching the moments used for figure 3. The figure

shows that the dispersion in investment increases with time as
would be expected given that the price process follows geometric

Brownian motion.

At the end of the 10th year, the mean

cumulative investment is 7.5% with a standard deviation of 4.7%.

Minimum investment is 2.5% and the maximum is 31%. As figure 5
shows, cases with cuu1ative investment after 10 years as large
as 15% are quite rare.

Hence we do not attribute our results

showing low investment under price uncertainty to the particular
price process that we generated in figure 3.

Figures 6 and 7 show the effect of instituting a 15% tax
credit on the purchase of the conservation capital at time t—l.

For the certainty case (figure6), the stimulation to investment
is dramatic.

Investment increases from about 27% to 43% as a

direct result of the credit.

Investment after 5 years is now

about 60% versus 40% without the credit.

However, with the

geometric Brownian motion assumption, the credit is much less
effective (figure 7).

Investment increases by .2 % as a direct

result of the credit and by less than 3% after 20 years6.

Of course, with the investment trigger increased by a factor

of 4, these results are perhaps not surprising. But note that if

factor would be even larger. Using data from 1960 through 1981
gives estimates of b/(b—l) of 7.65.

The simulation results show in a striking way that
uncertainty can sharply reduce investment in conservation
capital. Moreover, a tax credit can have a significant effect on
increasing investment —

to

the order of doubling the probability

of investing in conservation capital. However, in the presence
of price uncertainty, the probability of investing is so low that

doubling the investment probability has negligible effects on
total conservation investment. In the next section, we turn to a

closer examination of the state and federal tax incentives that

existed in the late 70s and early 80s which will provide the
basis for an empirical examination of the actual response of
residential conservation investment to tax incentive programs.

IV. Tax Policy Toward Conservation Investment

Tax incentives to stimulate conservation investment existed

during the l970s-l980s at both the federal and state level.

As

most state programs "piggy backed" on the federal system, we
discuss the latter program in greater detail. We also discuss
how previous researchers have tried to measure the effectiveness
of the tax incentives at stimulating investment.

The Energy Tax Act of 1978 (ETA78) provided homeowners with
tax credits to encourage conservation investment activities such

as insulating walls and ceilings, replacing furnace burners and
10

ignition systems, storm or thermal windows and doors, installing

clock thermostats, and weatherstripping.

These investments

received a credit of 15%, with a credit ceiling set at $300 and

could only be taken on houses that were constructed prior to

1977.
In addition to the federal credit, nine states offered a
conservation incentive (either a deduction or a credit) over the
period 1979 through 1985 when the federal credit expired.8 These
state programs will be important in the econometric work below as

they provide variation in the tax price of conservation
investment which allows us to identify the importance of the
programs in stimulating investment.

Given the broad coverage and low cost of some highly
productive improvements, one might think that the credits would
be universally claimed.

Surprisingly, this is not the case.

applied beginning April 20, 1977. Credits for investments made

in 1977 could be taken in 1978; hence the data for 1978 cover
roughly 20 months.

The fraction of returns filing the credit

drops from 6.5% in 1978 to roughly 3% by 1985, the last year in
which the credit could be taken.

One might think that conservation credits might be
fraudulently claimed, or that, unaware of the possibility of
taking them, taxpayers may fail to claim a credit they ought to.

Fortunately, the TCMP audit data allow us to analyze the extent

to which mistakes or frauds occur. The 1986 TCMP data indicate
that of the 560 million dollars of tax credits claimed in 1985,

531 million were legitimate, and an additional 28 million

allowable claims which were not originally reported were
discovered.

These numbers are typical of those for most items

covered by the audit, and indicate that fraud or mistakes will
not be an important source of measurement error in the empirical

work we present below .

In

Table 2, we report the distribution of returns for 1979

by income and the fraction of credit takers in each group along

with the fraction homeowners.

The probability of taking the

credit rises with income and reaches a peak of 15.67% for returns

in the $50,000 to $100,000 group.

For the group with AGI less

12

than $10,000, the fraction of takers is 1.21%, roughly a third of
the fraction of takers in the next income group.

Table 3 reports the fraction of credit takers and mean
conservation expenditures by state for 1979 along with the
average credit for those who took the credit in each state. The

geographic distribution of the propensity to take the federal
credit for the most part is not surprising.

However, certain

states stand out, California most prominently.

With the

exception of Hawaii, California had the lowest fraction of credit

takers of all the states.

California's state conservation

incentive program is unique in offering a very generous credit
for conservation activity (40% of costs). However, the credit is

net of the federal credit.

For most households, it is simply

easier to claim the entire 40% on the state return than claim 15%

on the federal return and the remaining 25% on the state return.

Thus the low participation rate in the federal program for
California reflects a measurement problem, a problem we address
in the estimation strategy below.

Results of previous research on the effectiveness of energy

tax incentive programs have been relatively inconclusive. This
literature consists of a small series of survey studies, (Pitts

and Wittenbach (1981), Carpenter and Chester (1984), Peterson
(1985)) and three econometric analyses (Cameron (1985), Walsh
(1987),(l989) and Dubin and Henson (1988)). The survey studies

indicate that the tax credits are important motivators for
purchases of renewable energy improvements,
13

but not for

conservation.

Cameron does not directly estimate the additional investment

resulting from federal and state incentive programs but rather

estimates the price elasticity of investment for energy
conservation and renewable investment. Using cross section data
from the National Interim Energy Consumption Survey of 1977—78,

she constructs and estimates a nested logit model over many
improvement alternatives and finds significant price sensitivity,
suggesting that credits might provide an important stimulus.

One problem with the approach used by Cameron is that it is

assumed that changes in price due to the implementation of tax
credits will have the same effect as direct changes in investment
costs.

This will be true in a world in which the transaction

costs of taking the credit are minimal and in which information

about the tax incentives are widely dispersed.

Moreover, one

must have a positive tax liability to benefit from the credit.

In the absence of these conditions, the tax credit changes in
price may induce less investment than an equivalent direct change
in price.

Walsh (1987,1989), using Department of Energy data and state

level variation

in tax credits, attempts to test directly

whether the tax incentives at the federal or state level induce
additional conservation investment.

He found that the states

which had high energy tax credits experienced very low
conservation investment activity. In a cross section regression,

he finds a significant negative effect of tax credits on
14

investment.

Dubin and Henson, used a cross section of IRS audits for

1979 and related energy conservation activity to state level
temperature data and individual characteristics.10

They found

that investment increases with income and that it responds to
measures, such as "heating degree days", which help predict its
return.

While the coefficient on a dummy variable for the

existence of a state credit for conservation is positive in a

regression with federal tax credit claimed as the dependent
variable, it is statistically insignificant with a t statistic of
roughly .3.

Thus, the only evidence relating the tax incentives to
investment activity suggests that they have been ineffective,
although investment does respond to other variables that enhance

its profitability. We believe that there are two major reasons
why these studies have been unable to find a statistically and
economically significant relationship between the tax incentive
programs and investment.

First there are individual and state

specific effects which are likely to be correlated with the
explanatory variables.

State specific effects include the

measurement error noted for California as a result of the nature

of the state incentive program.

Individual specific effects

include individual propensities to

equipment. These might include conservation "taste" factors as
well as attributes of the housing stock that individuals choose.

Second, many of the state tax incentive programs are deduction
programs. A dollar of deduction reduces taxable income by 1 and
tax liability by m where m is the marginal tax rate. Therefore,

the tax price of one dollar's worth of investment is 1—rn.
Measuring the tax price accurately for residents of states with
deduction incentives is important. We use the NBER TAXSIM state
tax calculator to measure the tax price at the individual level.
In the next section, we describe our data set and present results

from a set of regressions where we measure the responsiveness of

residential conservation investment to changes in state tax
incentives.

-

V. Empirical
As the last two simulations in section III suggest, an
important question is whether tax policy can substantially affect

the decision to invest in conservation capital.

We test the

effectiveness of tax incentives directly by estimating the effect

of state tax incentive programs on the decision to invest in a

discrete choice framework.

To do this, we exploit the

information filed on federal returns by tax payers claiming the

federal residential energy conservation tax credit along with
variations in state level tax incentives.

The regression estimates are from a reduced farm model in

which the dependent variable (' is a binary variable
indicating whether the tax payer has an expenditure for
16

conservation investment.

We relate this to a vector of

explanatory variables which theory suggests should help determine

the payoffs to investing. As discussed previously, it is also

important to account for individual heterogeneity or fixed
effects11. Assuming the probability of making the investment has
the extreme value distribution, then

eai+1t
P(I1=l) = ____________

(9)

Following

the suggestion of Chamberlain (1980), we condition the

likelihood function on making an expenditure at least once. This

latter probability will equal the sum of the probabilities that
Z

equals 1, 2, and so on. To see how this solves the problem

of heterogeneity, consider the probability that I =

1

in a

two period model where P(l,0) is defined as the joint probability

of taking the credit in the first year and not taking it in the
second year. P(0,l) is similarly defined.

(10)

P(I1=1) = P(1,0)+P(01)

Consider the probability that we observe P(0,1) conditional on
the sum being equal to 1:

11 The likely direction of the fixed effects bias may well explain
previous estimates which found the wrong sign on the tax credit
variable. If a state is populated by citizens who have a higher
than average probability of investing because of unobservables,
it may be that that state has a low probability of introducing a
credit program. This type of interaction is consistent with the
evidence provided below.

its

I>l then we have to consider all the

possible ways each of the sums could be obtained, but the fixed
effect will still disappear. The number of possibilities will be

with K successes in T trials, for each k.

Unlike a fixed effects regression model with a continuous
dependent variable, we cannot "back out" estimates of the fixed
effects and forecast the dependent variable. Thus we are unable

to answer the question "How does increasing x change the
probability of making a conservation investment?".

However,

Chamberlain (1989) shows that

which is of interest, and doesn't depend on a because the odds
format makes the a's cancel. Thus we can answer the question,
"By what proportion will the probability of an agent taking the
action increase?".

We utilize data from tax returns for households followed
over the 3 year period from 1979 through 1981. The tax data are

drawn from the Ernst and Young! University of Michigan Tax
Research Database which consists of a simple random sample of
returns drawn by Social Security Number for the tax years 1979
through 198612. The number of returns each year varies from 9235
to 46,67013. From these returns we are able to construct a three

on each individual's state of residence, income,

number of

dependents, and home mortgage and property taxes (from which we

can infer home ownership status). There is also

information on

whether they filed an energy tax credit form, how large a credit
they received and their expenditures on the conservation portion.

In addition, there is detailed information on expenditures by
sub—categories (e.g. storm windows, insulation) .

Finally,

as

noted above, we can compute a measure of the tax price for
conservation investment using TAXSIM.

We merged tax data with data on energy prices from the
Department of Energy State Energy Price and Expenditure Data
System (SEPEDS).

This data set has detailed price and

expenditure information by state and year on the residential
sector for various energy sources.

In the regression results

reported below, we use the price for petroleum14. We divide this

price by a price index for insulation to obtain our measure of

Sefore turning to the reduced form logit results, there are

several modifications of the estimating equation that we make.

First we note that the theory suggests that the probability of

credit. The alternative approach and the one that we prefer is
to include U separately in the regression. We do this to account

for the possibility that the existence of the state level tax
incentive itself may have some positive effect on investment.
Alternatively, the incentive may not be fully understood or may
require complicated record keeping. In the former case, ws would

expect a strong effect of U on the probability of investing,
whereas in the latter case we'd expect a weak effect. We use the

probability of investing in conservation capital.16 We include a
homeownershiP variable since complete capitalization assures that

homeowners will appropriEIte the entire future stream of energy

savings whether they stay in the house or not.

Even if

capitalization is incomplete, they will receive more of the
savings than renters who receive none of the savings once they
inove.7 Thus we argue that homeowners should be more likely to
invest than renters.

A third factor which we account for in the regression is the

observation that previous studies find an inverse relationship

between income and the estimated discount rate (e.g. Hausmari
(1979)) .

could occur because of incomplete capital markets

We include adjusted gross income (AGI) in the

regression with the expectation that it will have a positive
effect on the probability of investment.

We also include a dummy variable for California in the
regression. As noted above, California offers a generous credit

for conservation activity (40% of costs net of the federal
credit) .

This

fact indicates that California residents should be

less likely to claim the federal credit. In addition, we include

year dummies to control for business cycle effects -

Moreover, if demand for rental housing is sufficiently

inelastic, then renters may receive little gain while renting as

the landlord may simply raise rents on the now more energy
efficient rental unit.
22

Finally, we exclude observations on individuals with AGI
less than $10,000 in the regressions. Many individuals in this

group are not "life cycle" low income people but rather
"transitory" low income

due to large business losses.

It is

difficult to measure their tax price accurately; moreover, this

group may be most likely to take advantage of carry forward

provisions in the federal tax code which confounds our
measurement of the appropriate tax price driving their
investment.

Our first regression result is for the pooled sample, and is

reported in Table 5.

The dependent variable is the dummy

variable indicating the presence of a credit for conservation
expenditures. We first discuss the non—price variables as their
effect is relatively stable across regressions. The probability
of investing goes up with income. Homeowners are more likely to

take a credit as are residents of states with colder climates

Each of these variables is

statistically significant with p-values less than .01.

The

coefficient on the dummy variable for California is consistently

negative though not always statistically significant.

These

results are consistent with results in earlier studies (e.g.
Dubin and Henson (1988) and Walsh (1989)).

Turning to the price and the tax price variables, we note

that both

have the wrong sign in the levels regression.

One

reason that the price variables may not be explaining investment
very well is the presence of correlated individual effects in the
23

error term.

The conditional logit fixed effects regression

allows us to estimate the price effects consistently in the
presence of correlated fixed effects.

We now turn to these

estinates. The price variable continues to have the wrong sign
but is now not significantly different from zero at the 5% level.

However, the tax price variable now has the correct sign and is
significant at the 5% level with a coefficient estimate of —2.39.

A decline in the tax price leads to an increase in the
probability of investment.

Below we discuss how one should

interpret the economic importance of this coefficient estimate.

The last two regressions test for the robustness of the tax

price coefficient estimate.

We begin by dropping the year

dutiies to ensure that important tax price information is not
being "soaked" up in the time effects. We note the statistical

importance of the time dummies as well as their economic
importance; business cycle effects are controlled for by these
variables.

There is no appreciable change in the tax price

coefficient estimates and it appears that the year effects are
now being captured by the price variable which now becomes highly
significant (p value less than .01).

The last column tests for the possibility that the tax price

effect is a spurious result.

One explanation for the negative

relationship between the tax price and the probability of
investment is that people anticipate the beginning of a new
program and delay investment until the program goes into effect.

While the net change in investment would be zero with the
24

implementation of a program, the estimated coefficient on the tax

price variable would be negative. To test for this possibility,

we constructed a dummy variable equaling one if a state had a
program in effect the following year and zero otherwise.

If

investment shifting were occurring, we should anticipate a
negative coefficient on this variable.
includes this variable.

The last regression

The estimated coefficient on the lead

tax variable is positive with a t statistic about 1 indicating
that tax timing is not driving our result.

How do we interpret the coefficient estimate on the tax
price variable? Based on the coefficient estimate of -2.39 and a

probability of investing equal to the mean of the data set
(.057), a 10% point decrease in the tax price leads to a 25%
increase in the probability of investing (.071).

However, the

point made in the simulation section still stands: Tax credits in

the face of uncertain price may contribute to a large change in
the log odds of the probability of investing. However this does

not lead to a substantial increase in the probability itself,
given the small amount of investment to begin with.

We conclude from these regression results that state tax
incentives have an effect on the probability of investment which
is statistically significant. However the economic importance of
the programs is slight - a result consistent with the simulations

based on the model of irreversible investment with price
uncertainty.

Both the simulation results and the empirical estimates cast
25

doubt on the effectiveness of energy tax credits in stimulating

energy conservation investment in the presence of substantial
energy price uncertainty. In addition, the coefficient estimates

on the income and home ownership variables suggest that the
benefits of the credit accrue most to higher income individuals.
VI. Conclusion

In this paper, we've argued that residential energy

conservation investment should be treated as a form of
irreversible investment in the face of stochastic prices. Doing
so leads to a natural explanation of the low energy conservation

investment that occurred in the 1970s and l980s in response to

the residential energy conservation tax credit.

Simulation

results show that price uncertainty of the magnitude observed
during the 70s and 80$ can drive conservation investment down to

levels approaching zero. A tax credit of the size given by the
federal residential energy tax credit will increase investment by
very small amounts over a ten to twenty year horizon.

We then consider a data set on roughly 38,000 individuals
followed over a three year period and find that the conservation

incentive programs offered by state governments in addition to
the federal program have a statistically significant effect on
investment once we control for individual (fixed) effects. Based

on our preferred estimate of the tax price coefficient, a 10
percentage point change in the tax price for energy investment

would lead to a 24% increase in the probability of energy
conservation investment.

Bowever, given the low level of
26

investment due to price uncertainty, the actual change in
investment is quite low - on the order of a 1.5% increase in the

probability of investment.

These results suggest that a tax

credit is not an effective tool for promoting conservation
investment.

Put differently, the expiration of Residential

Energy Tax Credit in 1985 had very little effect on the overall
energy improvement adoption rate.

If the rate of conservation

investment is suboptimal from the societal perspective, then the

challenge to policy makers now is to construct a more effective
policy instrument to encourage conservation in the face of energy
price uncertainty.

We solve the problem of choosing the optimal investment time

to maximize energy savings when the price of energy and capital
investment follow geometric Brownian motions.

First, we note

that we can apply Ito's Lemma to determine the stochastic motion

and variance (o) equal to (o+a

Once the investment is made, the value of the investment

(conditional on energy price P), V, will equal P/(7—1) — K.
The investment is only made if P/K exceeds a trigger level h*.

Alternatively, an arbitrage argument requires
