GOVERNMENT SOLVENCY, PONZI FINANCE AND THE REDUNDANCY
AND USEFULNESS OF PUBLIC DEBT

ABSTRACT
We investigate how the ability of the government to depart from budget balance and issue
debt expands the set of equilibria that can be supported using lump-sum tax-transfer instnirnents. We

show how this depends on the restrictions that exist on the capacity to tax and make transfer
payments, and what these restrictions imply for the government's ability to issue debt.

Central to our analysis is the defmition of solvency for an infinite-lived government in an
infinite-lived economy with overlapping generations of finite-lived households. Our specification is
derived from the demand for public debt by private agents and the non-negativity constraints on the

capital stock and on private consumption by all generations. Under fairly tight restrictions on the
government's tax-transfer menu, our solvency constraint implies the conventional solvency constraint.

With unrestricted taxes and transfers Ponzi finance is always possible but 'inessential": it
does not expand the set of equilibria that can be supported. Ponzi finance can be "essential" when
taxes and transfers are restricted. The paper establishes a number of results that demonstrate how the

government's ability to issue debt allows restricted tax-transfer schemes to support all equilibria
attainable using unresiricted taxes and transfers.

(I) INTRODUCTION.

Does the ability of the government to depart from budget balance and issue or

retire debt expand or alter the set of equilibria that can be supported? We address
this question for the case in which fiscal policy, involving, in addition to borrowing,
the use of lump—sum taxes and transfers only, can be used for redistribution and
insurance among heterogeneous households 1• Heterogeneity is introduced using an

OLG model without private intergenerational gifts2.

The answer turns out to depend crucially on the richness of the set of
lump—sum tax—transfer instruments available and on the restrictions that this implies

for the government's ability to issue debt. Central to the argument is our solvency
constraint for an infinite—lived government3 in an infinite—lived economy with

overlapping generations of finite—lived households. The government is solvent if its

budgetary and financing policies are feasible currently and in all future periods. In
our model, government solvency is expressed as a set of three inequality constraints
on admissible sequences of taxes, transfers, public debt and exhaustive public

spending. They are derived from the requirement that the capital stock and private
consumption by each generation be non—negative in each period. In other words,
solvency for the infinite—lived government is derived from the (well—understood)
requirement of solvency (or non—bankruptcy) for each finite—lived household.

Consider economies in which the long—run real interest rate is above the

long—run growth rate of efficiency labor. Under fairly tight restrictions on the ability

of the government to use taxes and transfers freely, our solvency constraint implies
the conventional solvency constraint, that the sequence of real public debt discounted

at the real interest rate converges to zero. The first sufficient condition is that net
transfer payments by the government to a generation during a period cannot change
sign (from positive when young to negative when old) over that generation's life

2

cycle. The second sufficient condition is that the long—run growth rate of transfers

to the young and taxes on the old is less than the long—run interest rate. If, for
instance, taxes and transfers cannot grow faster in the long run than efficiency labor,

or equivalently, if the ratio of taxes paid (transfers received) during a period by a
generation to the value of the physical resources owned by it, is bounded, the second
sufficient condition would be met.

Under less restrictive conditions on taxes and transfers, Ponzi finance may be
possible, regardless of the relationship between the long—run real interest rate and the
long—run real growth rate, and

regar&ess

of whether the economy is dynamically

efficient or Pareto—efficient. We distinguish between

is Ponzi schemes that expand

formation that can

the

Pouzi finance, that

supported, and

inessential

capital

Ponzi finance that does not

have any real effects. The same essential—inessential distinction is made for
public debt as such- Whether or not public debt (Ponzi finance) is essential
depends on the restrictions imposed on the government's ability to use taxes
and transfers.

We establish three equivalence results'. The first states that with
unrestricted time— and age—specific taxes and transfers, the ability to depart

from budget balance does not permit additional equilibria to be supported.

Specifically,

any intergenerational redistribution and insurance that

can be

provided with government borrowing or lending can also be provided with a
balanced government budget.

The second states that, if there are restrictions on the government's

ability to levy
given

age—specific taxes and

make age—specific transfers during any

period, then the option of unbalancing the budget enhances the set of

equilibria

that can be supported. Specifically, if the government is

constrained to have only age—independent taxes and transfers, the ability to

3

unbalance

can

be

the budget permits the government to support all the equilibria that

supported with unrestricted age—specific taxes and transfers.

This second

proposition will not in general hold if the conventional

government solvency constraint is imposed, and requires our less restrictive

solvency constraint in order to be valid. Essential Ponzi finance
characterizes the age—independent tax—transfer policies.
Our third equivalence proposition is that even rather severe restrictions
on the variation of taxes and transfers over the lifetime of a generation do

not restrict the equilibria that can be supported, provided unbalanced budgets

are permitted. This result holds under the conventional solvency constraint
and does not require Ponzi finance.
The substitution of government borrowing for current lump—sum

such

taxes

(and

further future changes in lump—sum taxes, transfers and borrowing as may

be required to preserve government

solvency) will affect the equilibrium of an

economy if it redistributes resources among private agents with different

marginal propensities to spend. In the Samuelson [l9S8 overlapping
generations (OLC) model used in our paper, there is heterogeneity between

generations. Typically, postponing taxation through borrowing or
redistributing directly from the young to the old will reduce aggregate

saving. Such "financial crowding out" has been a central theme of
macroeconomics.

Alternative government financing policies not only effect redistribution
among generations, in a stochastic environment they will also permit trades

across states of nature or intergenerational insurance. There is by now quite
a rich literature on this subject. Such intergenerational redistribution schemes
as

social security taxes and retirement benefits can provide insurance that either

cannot be provided by the market or is provided ineffidently5. OLC models have

4

incomplete

market participation. Because individual households cannot enter

into insurance contracts before they are born, there may be incomplete

(Blanchard and Veil [1992]). Even in a dynamically.efficient

risk—sharing

economy, the public provision of this insurance can have implications for

Pareto-efficiency (see Zilcha [1990] and Blanchard and Veil [1992fl.6

Rather than investigating the many interesting positive and welfare aspects

of intergenerational redistribution and of the provision of intergenerational
insurance through the government budget (see e.g. Fischer (1983), Enders and
Lapan [1982], Stiglitz (1983], Merton (19841, Gordon and Varian (1988), Pagano

[1988] and Gale [1990]), we shall focus on the equivalence results, on the

implications of our definition of government solvency, on the conditions under
which

Ponzi finance is possible and on the role of Pouzi finance.

The outline of the rest of this paper is as follows. Section II develops
the model. Section III introduces our government solvency constraint, relates
it to the conventional solvency constraint and discusses what it implies for

the scope for Ponzi finance. Section IV contains our three equivalence
results and analyzes how they depend on the ability of the government to
engage in Ponzi finance. Section V concludes.

Consider

the closed economy one—good version of Diamond's [1965]

generations have the same utility functions and maximize expected utility.

People live for two periods, work in the first period of life and retire in
the second.

There is no intergenerational gift or bequest motive. Labor

The solvency condition (111.3) has the prima facie attractive property of
implying the same kind of present value or intertemporal budget constraint

(111.4) for the infinite horizon case as for the finite horizon case. If
t—1+T is the finite terminal period, then the standard (and uncontroversial)
government

anything

solvency constraint is p 1+Tbt+T 0 (the government doesn't owe

at the end of the last period). A rational household sector ensures

that Pt_1+Tbt+T

0. From (111.1) these two weak inequalities imply, that the

value of the current stock of debt is equal to the (expectation of) the
present

discounted value of future primary

(non—interest) surpluses. This is

the same as (111.4), with jim dropped. The imposition of (111.3) has been

quasi—automatic in moden macroeconomic analysis. For a very small sample see
Barro [1979] ,

Buiter

[1985] ,

Pagano [1988] and

Blanchard et. al. [1990]. It

has been the subject of extensive empirical testing (see e.g. Hamilton and

Flavin [1986J, Wilcox [1989], Corsetti [1990], Grilli [1990) and Buiter and Patel
[1991]).
We

believe that the analogy with the finite—horizon case is potentially

misleading. It is by no means obvious what are, in an economy without a
terminal date, the feasible debt strategies of an infinite—lived government

9

facing an infinite sequence of finite—lived overlapping generations (see e.g.

Shell [1971] and Vilson [1981]). As we shall see, without a—priori
restrictions

on taxes and transfers, our model has a surprising range of

feasible debt strategies, many of which allow for Ponzi finance. Formally,
Ponzi

finance can be

defined

as follows for our model:

Ye proceed by investigating what kind of constraints the model of Section

be made

arbitrarily large (positive or negative) by making matching large (positive or

given

4 and L2,

r+1. Kt+j,

as long as period ti-I taxes on the old, rLt

are assigned a matching large (positive or negative value).

Since 4 and

by (111.6) is ptBt+l +

There also is a lower bound on the

amount of public debt that can be issued (or an upper bound on the stock of

public credit to the private sector). It follows from non—negativity of
consumption by the old in period t. From the resource constraint

These upper and lower bounds on the public debt in each period, together
with the requirement that exhaustive public spending cannot be negative and
cannot exceed the total physical resources available in any period, constitute

our definition of feasible fiscal policy. A solvent government is a
government whose fiscal policy is feasible in a world with rational private
agents'7.

Note that this definition of solvency can be generalized easily to all
OLG models with finite household horizons. It relies only on the reasonable
postulate that in the last period of its life, each household disposes of all
real and financial assets (including public debt) and pays off any debts it
has carried into that period and does not purchase any new assets or incur any
new debt.

Since the government solvency constraint is derived from the requirement

that 4,

c1

and X ? 0 for all t

0, another way of interpreting it is that

the government refrains from policies that will bankrupt the private sector:

it does not select sequences for taxes, transfer payments, debt and exhaustive
spending that will cause the non—negativity constraints on consumption by both
generations and on the capital stock to become binding'8.

saving by the young depends on the actual distribution of disposable

14

the distribution of lifetime disposable resources is skewed towards youth. If
the government has the ability to tax the members of any given generation

and models

in which interest income too is

taxable. He, however, does not make the distinction between taxes on the
young, taxes on the old and aggregate taxes. As we shall see below, aggregate
taxes can be zero, and therefore less than the endowment (wage income) and

less that the sum of the endowment and interest income, while the debt grows

at a rate at least equal to the rate of interest forever.

how such restrictions affect the government's ability to run Ponzi

schemes and the implications for resource allocation of feasible Ponzi

Corollary.
With unrestricted taxes and transfers, the competitive equihbriurrt model

with the finite—lived OLG household sector does not require any bounds on the

level or rate of rowth of public debt. Ponzi finance is therefore always possible,
regardless of the relationship between the interest rate and the growth rate,
regardless of whether the economy is dynamically efficient and regardless of
whether the economy is Pareto—efficient.

Case 2: Restrictions on differences in taxes and transfers in any period for
overlapping
Three

generations.

interesting restrictions fitting this category come to mind.
(a) Equal taxes or transfers per generation for all generations alive

daring

any given period.

In this case r(1÷n) =

this restriction does not bite. The long—run growth rate of the debt (over
2—period intervals) equals the interest rate, even when the

are "essential": without them the restrictions on taxes and transfers would

for all t 0. In Section (IV) we show that this

restriction too does not bite. The long—run growth rate

of the debt (over 2

intervals) equals the sum of the interest rate and the growth rate of
the labor force. Essential Ponzi finance subsequences therefore play a role

21

(c) Equal taxes per unit of efficiency labor for all generations alive

In this case

(1+wt)r_i

for all t

0. In Section (IV) we also show

this restriction to be toothless. The long—run growth rate of the debt (over
2—period intervals) is the sum of the interest rate and the growth rate of

efficiency labor. Such Ponzi finance subsequences are essential.
What drives these results is that even though the two generations (the
young and
during

any given

old) alive in

period are treated in the same way

that period, we can still vary taxes and transfers freely over the

life—cycle
and

the

of each generation, making transfer payments to them while young

taxing them when old.

Case 3: Restrictions on variations in taxes and transfers over its lifeti.e
for any given generation.
The most interesting restriction is that net taxes in each of the two
periods of a household's life must have the same sign, that is
=

t4

A

0 for all t ? 0.

We need just one of the weak inequalities of the solvency constraint in
order to show that, under this restriction, Ponzi finance is possible only if

the interest rate is below the growth rate of efficiency labor. Consider
equations (III.8a) and (III.Ba'), rewritten for this case as

(III.23a) PtRt+l

From (III.23a), the only way for the debt to grow faster than the growth
rate of efficiency labor forever, is for 4

to

be negative and for —4

to

grow

at a rate higher than the growth rate of labor productivity. If the debt
grows faster than the growth rate of efficiency labor forever, (III.23b) can

22

only

be satisfied if AtrLt is positive and has a growth rate higher than the

growth rate of efficiency labor. That is impossible since At .

0.

Ve

conclude that —r can grow no faster than the growth rate of labor
productivity and that the growth rate of the debt can therefore be no higher

than the growth rate of efficiency labor. The debt can therefore grow faster
than the interest rate forever only if the interest rate is below the growth
rate of efficiency labor.

Note that Case 3 includes quite a variety of fiscal rules, including per
capita taxes (or transfers) constant across generations at a point in time,

and growing

over time at a constant proportional rate u, that

= r0(l+v)'
permanently

for

all t ? 0. Note that our argument

is 4 =

implies that v

cannot be

higher that the growth rate of labor productivity.

Blanchard and Veil [1992J considered the special case of this model where
the labor force is constant (n =
for all t

0),

there is no productivity growth (°

0), there is no exhaustive public spending (Ct =

and there are no taxes or transfers (r0 =

0).

0 for all t

0)

In their model, debt obviously

cannot grow faster than wage income in the long rim. In the deterministic
version of their model, this means that only in a dynamically inefficient
equilibriwn can there be viable Ponzi schemes, with the public debt growing
forever at least as fast as the interest rate but no faster than the growth
rate of labor income.
In general (that is, even if net taxes can change sign over the life
cycle), if the long—run rate of interest exceeds the long—rim growth rate of
the disposable income of the young (wages net of taxes on the young), that is,

if lint {At{Ot(f(kt)_ktf(kt))_4](1+n)t} = 0

conventional solvency constraint emerges.

If

the taxes paid (transfers received) by each generation are

distortionary, it is unlikely that the long—run growth rate of per capita

taxes (transfers) can exceed the long—nm growth rate of productivity. There
will be some finite upper bound on the ratio of taxes and transfers per

generation to the real (physical) resources owned by that generation. Tax
administration and collection costs that are strictly convex functions of the
amount of taxes raised, will also put a finite upper bound on the ratio of
taxes paid to real resources owned (see Barro [1976], Iccallun [1984]

[1989)

,

Kremers

and Bohn [1991}).

We summarize the foregoing discussion in the following Proposition:

tax

paid

by any generation at a given age cannot change sign

over the lifetime of that generation,

or, the long—run growth rate of taxes paid or transfers received at a given

age by a generation is less than the long—run rate of interest.
In

order for the public debt to grow at least as fast as the rate of

interest forever, when the rate of interest is above the growth rate of

efficiency labor, it must be possible to make transfer payments to a
generation when it is young and

to tax it when it is old; in addition, the

growth rate of these taxes and transfers must be at least as high as the

interest rate24. Note that it is only the taxes on or transfers to each
generation that must have a growth rate at least as high as the interest rate.

THREE EQUIVALENCE RESULTS.
We

can

now can state our first equivalence result:

Proposition 3.
Given initial values

and b0 and a feasible sequence g, t 0 , any

equilibrium for Pj' k1, c and c with arbitrary paths of debts b and of
lump—sum taxes and transfers r and r for all i I can be replicated without
debt and deficits, that is by using balanced—budget lump—sum taxes and transfers
only.

26

What this means is that, in a deterministic model, any intergenerational

redistribution that can be supported by debt and taxes can also be supported just

with taxes and without debt. In the stochastic case it is true in addition that any
intergenerational insurance supported with public debt, unbalanced budgets and age—

and generation—dependent lump—sum taxes can also be provided with a balanced

budget and without public debt.

Proof: An equilibrium is characterized for all t

transfers.
It can
constraint

be

checked easily that, if

the

conventional government solvency

(111.3) is satisfied under the single overbar policy, it is also

satisfied under the double overbar policy. The validity of Proposition 3,
unlike that of Proposition 4 and its Corollaries belov, is therefore not

dependent on the acceptability of our generalized solvency constraint. The
reason is that under the double overbar policy in the proof of Proposition 2,
taxes and transfers are not in any way restricted.

Proposition 3 is a generalization of the well—known proposition that an
equilibrium with positive public debt financed by taxes on the young is
equivalent to a balanced budget, pay—as—you—go (or unfunded) social security
retirement

scheme in which lump—sum taxes on the young are paid out as

lump—sum transfers

to the old. Calvo and

any equilibrium for v

time—dependent lump—sum taxes and transfers but without public debt and with
balanced public sector budgets, can also be supported with age—independent (equal

per capita for both generations alive in any given period) lump—sum taxes and
transfers, provided unbalanced public sector budgets are allowed.

This means that any intergenerational redistribution and intergenerational
insurance supported with balanced—budget age—dependent lump—sum taxes and

can also be supported with age—independent lump—sum taxes and

transfers,

but

is

tranfers

with unbalanced public sector budgets. Note that, from Proposition 3,

there

no loss of generality in taking the benchmark equilibrium of Proposition 4

to have a balanced budget and zero public debt.

We shall give a detailed proof only for the case where the unbalanced
budget,

age—independent tn—transfer policy involves equal per capita taxes on

both generations alive in any given period (Case 2b) of our taxonomy in
Section III. The proofs for equal taxes per generation (Case 2a) and equal
taxes per efficiency unit of labor (Case 2c) are virtually identical.

Proof: Variables with single overbars represent the benchmark balanced—budget

policy with age—dependent taxes and transfers. Variables with double overbars
represent the age—independent tn/transfer case with an unbalanced budget.

satisfied under the double overbar regime ((IV.11) and (IV.12) hold). a

While this completes the proof of Proposition 4, it is instructive to
investigate the behavior of taxes and of the public debt under the double

overbar regime. It tuns out that Ponzi finance of a special kind (the
sequence of government debt will have infinite subsequences that grow faster
than the rate of interest forever if the population growth rate is positive),

31

will in general be necessary for the age—independent tax—transfer regime to

support the same equilibria as the unrestricted tax—transfer regime. Ponzi
finance

is therefore essential under the restricted tax—transfer scheme.

the government from replicating any equilibrium supported by a balanced budget

Since, by assumption, taxes paid to the government cannot change sign

Proposition 3 states that public debt and deficits (and by implication
Ponzi finance) are redundant policy instruments as long as the fiscal

authority

has unrestricted age—specific lump—sum taxes and transfers.

Proposition 4 and its

two Corollaries and

Proposition 5 emphasize that a

fiscal authority with a restricted tax—transfer instrumentarium may be able to
use public debt and deficits as perfect substitutes for the missing
age—specific

taxes and transfers, provided the government solvency constraint

is specified as in (III.Sa,b and c). Essential (subsequence) Ponzi finance
may be a feature of these government borrowing and lending strategies (vide
Proposition 4 and its Corollaries).
Our approach to government solvency has

[l986J, Wilcox [1989], Corsetti [1990] , Grilli 11990) and Buiter and Patel [1991]).

All these papers used variants of the convergence—in—expectation version of the

generations alive during any given period can be treated differently by the
tax—transfer system (see the proof of Proposition 5).

(V) CONCLUSION.

Merely

looking at the stock of public debt, without attempting to

evaluate the total impact of the fiscal—financial policy nles on what
Auerbach, Cokhale and Kotlikoff [1991] have called the "generational accounts"
can be very misleading as an indicator of thefl degree of financial crowding out

pressure in the economy. We shoved that, given a sufficiently rich
tax—transfer menu, the government could achieve any desired intergenerational
redistribution and insurance with public debt, without it or indeed with

public credit. It is when tax—transfer options are constrained that the
option of public borrowing or lending becomes valuable, both for
intergenerational redistribution and for intergeneratIonal insurance.

The tax—smoothing proposition demonstrates how public debt can be useful
for conventional (not uncertainty—related) efficiency reasons in the absence

of non—distortionary taxes and transfers. Our paper complements this by
shoving how public debt can be useful in the pursuit of distributional
objectives and efficient intergenerational insurance schemes, if there is a

restricted

menu of lump—sum taxes and transfers.

An important part in the proof of the proposition that government debt

can be used to take over the intergenerational redistribution and insurance
roles of missing age—specific taxes and transfers, was our specification of
the government solvency constraint. A government is solvent if

policies that force the private sector into bankruptcy when there

exists an alternative policy that would not do so. The private sector is
bankrupt when the non—negativity constraints on consumption by the young,

38

consumption

by the old or the capital stock become binding. The stock of

public debt is limited by the condition that the total amount

is likewise limited by the condition that the total amount

to the government or through taxes, cannot exceed the capital income of the
old.

Ponzi finance is possible, regardless of the relationship between

the interest rate and the growth rate, and regardless of whether or not the

economy is dynamically inefficient or Pareto efficient. If either of these
assumptions is violated, our solvency constraint implies (when the long—run
interest rate exceeds the long—run growth rate of efficiency labor) that the
conventional solvency constraint applies: the sequence of public debt
discounted at the rate of interest converges to zero.

of uncertain lifetimes (a feature that is absent from our model), a compulsory social
security retirement scheme can provide an annuity that is actuarially fairer than
those provided by the voluntary private annuities market which is adversely affected
by adverse selection (see Abel

Varian 11980], Feldstein [1988], Kimball and Naákiw [1989] and Kaplow J1991J

labor income. The positive and welfare consequences of such social insurance will of
course depend on the availability and nature of private insurance arrangements and
the reasons for the absence of a set of complete insurance markets. Typically,
adverse selection problems can be mitigated by compulsory social insurance through
the tn-transfer mechanism while moral hazard problems affect efficient public
provision of insurance as much as private provision.

161f we extended the government financial liability menu, say by allowing
longer maturity debt, the definition would have to be adapted to the specific
set of government debt instruments allowed. The statement that the government
never runs a primary surplus, always defines Ponzi finance.

liThis is in the spirit of O'Connell and Zeldes [1988) , who point out that
in order for the government to run a "rational" Ponzi scheme, a rational
private sector must be willing to be at the receiving end of such a scheme.

°Note that in our model both the wage rate and the marginal product of
capital are positive, because of we restrict the level of labor—augmenting
productivity to be postive. Without a government sector, private bankruptcy
would therefore not occur. If the technology were to permit private
bankruptcy even without a government, our solvency constraint would be
modified as follows. The government does not select sequences for taxes,
transfer payments, debt and exhaustive spending that will cause the
non—negativity constraints on consumption by both generations and on the
capital stock to become binding if there exist alteniative sequences of the

government instruments that would avoid this.

If you tax the young more in
