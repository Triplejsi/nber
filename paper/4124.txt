FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN THE U.S.:
CHANGES OVER THREE DECADES

ABSTRACT

U.S. direct investment inflows in the 1980s were almost half the
world's total. Even this large inflow leaves foreign firms employing less than
5 per cent of the U.S. labor force, but twice that share in manufacturing. That

increase is related to the internationalization of production by foreign firms
more than to competitive weakness of U.S. firms.
Foreign affiliates import more relative to their exports than U.S. firms

but are moving closer to the behavior of U.S. firms. The trade balances of
both are sensitive to exchange rates.

The financing of foreign direct investment from retained earnings
dropped almost to zero in the 1980s. One reason is the rapid growth of this
investment and another is its low profitability.

Foreign Direct Investment in the U.S.:
Changes

*
Over Three Decades

Robert E. Lipsey

I. Historical Background

It has been a characteristic of the foreign investment history of the
United States as far back as there is any statistical record, and probably earlier

also, that while inward investment was largely in portfolio form, outward
investment was mainly direct investment. That is, the outward investment
mostly involved control of foreign operations by U.S. firms, while the inward
investment took the form of lending by foreigners to government agencies or

enterprises that were controlled by Americans. The contrast between the two
sides of the investment balance sheet can be summarized in the Table 1, to the

extent that the historical record permits the distinction to be made.
The individual figures here often rely on weak statistical foundations

and the fluctuations in the ratios should not be taken very seriously. For
example, the sharp rise in the share of direct investment in the U.S. outward
total between 1929 and 1935 to a large extent reflects the fact that, in the data

-3source, bond holdings were adjusted to market value in 1935 while direct
investments were not, although they too must have fallen substantially in
market value. The contrast between inward and outward investment is clear,

however. Direct investment was almost always more than half the outward
investment total but never more than a quarter of the inward investment.
The large decline in the share of direct investment on the outward side

between 1919 and 1929 has had its counterpart in more recent years, as we

discuss later. That decline reflected a tremendous expansion in portfolio
lending, concentrated in Latin America to a much larger extent than ever
before. Much of that portfolio investment disappeared in defaults and price
depreciation during the 1930s.

Since direct investment is a transfer more of technological or
management skills than of capital, it may seem surprising that there was so

little inflow into the United States during the 19th century, when several
European countries must have possessed superior technology and skills. One

explanation may be that the transfer of skills took a different form when
transportation and communication were so slow and primitive compared to that

in recent years. Because of the difficulty of controlling foreign enterprises
from a home base, much of the transfer of knowledge took the form of human

migration, either to establish enterprises in the United States or to manage
them after they were first established. Also, as Mira Wilkins (1989) points
out in her recent study of foreign investment in the United States before 1914,

-4the distinction between direct and portfolio investment was not always a sharp

one. Even portfolio investors sometimes intervened in the management of

American firms when things went badly. And many of the earlier direct
investments in the United States were what she refers to as "free-standing"
enterprises, differing from most U.S. direct investment in recent years in that

they were owned by foreigners but not by foreign firms. They were not
subsidiaries of multinational firms, as is typical now, although they were
sometimes parts of loose networks trading with each other and sometimes
sharing expertise in technical fields. Such enterprises were probably much
more likely over time to turn into domestic U.S. firms with the migration of
their owners or adaptation to local conditions in the United States than are the

current subsidiaries of multinational enterprises.

II. The Magnitude of Foreign Direct Investment in the U.S.

II.A. The U.S. Share in the World's Stocks and Flows

The dominant role of the United States as a supplier of direct
investment to other countries before the 1970s is reflected in the fact that U.S.

outward investment accounted for over half of the developed world's stock of

direct investment in 1967 and 1971, with the next most important direct
investor, the U.K., owning only about 15-17 per cent, and no other single
country accounting for more than 6 per cent (UN, 1978, Table 111-32). On the

other side of the account, foreign direct investment in the United States was

-5only 9 per cent of the world's total stock in 1967 and 11 per cent in 1975 (UN
1978, Table 111-33).

The U.S. share of direct investment outflows since the late 1960s is
described in Table 2. It was well over half the developed country total in the
1960s, and stayed at or close to half through the 1970s. In the second half of
the 1970s the U.S. was still responsible for almost half the developed country

outflow and more than 40 per cent of that of the whole world. Then, in the
first half of the 1980s, direct investment from the U.S. fell to less than 20 per

cent of the world outflow, and by the latest period had gone below 15 per
cent.

The opposite change took place on the inflow side. The direct
investment inflow to the United States was less than 10 per cent of the total
inflow to developed countries in 1960 and 1965-66, 17 per cent in 1967-69,

and jumped to about a quarter in 1973-75 and over a third in 1975-80. The

U.S. share of world inflows, only about 15 per cent in the early 1970s,
reached over a quarter in the late 1970s, almost 40 per cent in 198 1-85 and 46

per cent in 1985-89.

The consequence of these declining U.S. shares of outflows and
increasing shares of inflows can be seen in the shares of direct investment

stocks. By 1988 the U.S. held 35 per cent of the world stock of outward
investment and 31 per cent of the stock of inward investment. The U.S. share

of outward investment would probably be considerably higher if either of the

-7alternative valuations discussed below were used, since the U.S. investments

are older than those of most other countries. And the U.S. share of inward
investment would be considerably smaller if the reporting of inward investment

by other countries were more complete.
These figures by themselves seem to imply that the United States has

in recent years sharply cut back its former role as the major supplier of direct

investment capital to the rest of the world. It has, instead, apparently come
to absorb a very high proportion of the world's supply of direct investment
capital.

While there is some truth to this summary, there are also some
questionable aspects to it. Since the U.S. was the leading foreign direct

investor in the early post-WWII decades, many of its holdings are wellestablished foreign firms, and the further flow of U.S. direct investment
capital to foreign countries comes largely from the retained earnings of these

companies. While the U.S. reports these retained earnings as flows of direct
investment, many other countries do not, and the share of the U.S. in outflows

is therefore probably exaggerated. Since many other countries fail to report
the reinvested earnings in their inward investment accounts, the U.S. share on

the inward side is probably also overstated.

II.B. U.S. Inward and Outward Direct Investment Stocks and Flows

Since the U.S. was much more of an exporter than an importer of
direct investment for many years, as described above, the stock of foreign

-8direct investment in the U.S. was small compared to U.S. holdings abroad.
In 1950, for example, the inward stock was less than 30 per cent as large as

the outward stock, measured by book values, and in 1966, after the rapid
growth in U.S. outward direct investment, it was less than 20 per cent (Table

3). As foreign direct investment in the U.S. began to grow rapidly in the
years after 1977, the book value ratio rose, to the point where in 1990 the

foreign direct investment in the U.S. appeared about as large as the U.S.
direct investment abroad, a startling change in a little over a decade.

As this near-reversal of the direct investment balance took place,
along with the widely publicized story that the U.S. had gone in a few years

from a major creditor position to being "the world's greatest debtor," a
number of observers expressed skepticism about the significance of the book

value data. These are basically historical cost valuations, but those for U.S.
direct investment abroad are affected by exchange rate changes, since many

book values are translated into U.S. dollars from foreign currencies using
current exchange rates. Since U.S. direct investment abroad was much older

on average than foreign investment in the U.S., it seemed likely that it had
been made at much lower than current prices and, for that and other reasons,
was greatly undervalued (Eisner and Pieper, 1990, Ulan and Dewald, 1989).

That impression was reinforced by the fact that foreign income from direct

investment in the U.S. was much smaller than U.S. income on direct
investment abroad, well under half in 1990, for example (Di Lullo, 1991,

5). In response to these doubts, the BEA undertook the calculation of

some alternative measures. One, referred to as the "current-cost" method is
based on a revaluation of tangible assets. The main feature is a revaluation of

plant and equipment using a perpetual inventory calculation from past
expenditures. Land and inventories are also revalued to a rough measure of
current prices. The "market-value" method is a revaluation of the equity part
of direct investment on the basis of movements in stock prices (Landefeld and

Lawson, 1991).'
Two aspects of the story seem fairly clear. One is that foreign direct
investment in the U.S. is still considerably smaller than U.S. direct investment

abroad. The other is that the foreign investment in the U.S. grew much more

Both of these adjustments are extremely crude. Even if they were
not, there is no reason to expect them to give similar results. In the case of

U. S. corporations, for which the data are far better, the "adjusted book
value," akin to the current value used here, ranged from more than 20 per

cent below to almost 90 per cent above the market value of the equity
derived from stock prices between 1929 and 1958 (Goldsmith and Lipsey,
1963, Vol. I, Table 25), and from 30 per cent below to more than twice as
high between 1954 and 1977 (Cagan and Lipsey, 1978, Table 2-3).

rapidly than U.S. investment abroad after 1977, not only in percentage terms

but, by some measures, in dollar terms as well. Thus, as compared with the
1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the U.S. was an exceptionally attractive location for

foreign companies in the 1980s relative to the attractiveness of foreign
locations for U.S. companies. This was the case despite the very high price

of U.S. assets during part of this period as the exchange value of the U.S.
dollar reached its peak in 1984, and early 1985. However, the period after

1977 also includes two periods of low exchange values of the dollar, one
around 1980 and one after 1985.

While the expected effects of exchange rate changes on trade by
affiliates are clear, and are described below, the effects on investment flows
are ambiguous. For example, a high exchange value of the U.S. dollar makes
foreign production facilities more economical relative to those in the U.S., but

the incentive for a U.S. firm to invest in such facilities would be stronger if

the product were very tradable than if it were a service or a relatively
nontradable good. In addition the high value of the dollar would reduce the

price of a foreign facility in dollar terms, so that an increase in physical
investment might be offset by the decline in the dollar price of the foreign
assets and result in a decline in investment outflows denominated in dollars
unless there were a high elasticity of demand for productive assets, or a high
elasticity of substitution between U.S. and foreign assets.

- 12 -

II.C. Foreign-owned Firms' Shares of the U.S. Economy
The rapid growth of foreign direct investment in the U.S. should be

compared with some measures of the size of the U.S. economy. By some
indicators, this comparison places the foreign operations in perspective as even

now a small part of the economy. One such measure is the ratio of the stock
of foreign direct investment to the assets of U.S. corporations (Table 4). The

stock of foreign direct investment looks small by this standard, but the rapid
growth after 1977 does stand out.

If we confine our attention to the nonfinancial sector, foreign direct
investment appears more important. That is partly because foreign ownership

is less important in finance and partly because the finance sector's assets
include a large amount of holdings of the equity and debt of other sectors and

of the finance sector itself. There is much less duplication, in this sense, in

the nonfinancial sector's assets. The foreign share here more than doubled
between 1950 and 1980 or 1960 and 1980, and then much more than doubled
during the 1980s. Thus the growth of the foreign investment share accelerated

during the 1980s.
In a sense, this comparison between foreign investment and assets is

a misleading one because the numerator and denominator are different
concepts. More appropriate comparisons might be for shares of output or
shares of inputs into production, such as labor or capital, but these are more
limited in their time spans.

A calculation of the share of U.S. manufacturing industry assets under

foreign control in 1980 and 1988 was made by Orr (1991). As part of the
calculation he estimated what the foreign share of motor vehicle industry assets

would be if Japanese-owned auto production operations, listed under the

wholesale trade industry in the Department of Commerce data, were
transferred to the manufacturing category. An affiliate would be listed in
wholesale trade in the official data if its wholesale trade activities were larger
than the manufacturing activity. Since value of sales, rather than value added,

is the criterion, the method tends to put into wholesale trade affiliates that
would be in manufacturing by a value added or employment criterion because

ratios of sales to value added or employment added are much larger in
wholesale trade than in manufacturing. On's estimates for the foreign share
in manufacturing assets were (per cent):
1980

8.5

1988 14.3
Even with the estimated motor vehicle industry assets added, the shares in the

transportation equipment industry, 4.4 per cent in 1980 and 5.9 per cent in
1988, were well below the average for manufacturing.
A comparison of gross product, excluding banks, suggests something

less than a doubling of the foreign share in U.S. output between 1977 and
1987,

somewhat slower than that indicated by the direct investment data. Another
comparison, this time on the input side, for employment (Table 5), shows that

the levels are fairly small, but the growth has been rapid: the ratio tripled
between 1974 and 1989.
The employment shares of foreign firms vary greatly among sectors:

they are much higher in goods production, particularly mining and
manufacturing than in service sectors (Table 6). The sector ratios are subject
to the problem that establishments are classified differently in the two sources.

The aggregate U.S. data are classified by industry of establishment while the

data for foreign affiliates are consolidated into a total for all affiliates of a
single firm and classified by the predominant industry. The most likely effect

is to move trade and service operations into manufacturing, although some

manufacturing operations, such as Japanese auto plants, may be classified
under wholesale trade because the distribution activities related to importing

may be so large. The mining share is almost certainly exaggerated by the
inclusion of petroleum distribution operations with the refining activities of
foreign-owned petroleum companies.

- 18 The development that has been drawn the most public comment is the

growth of the foreign share in manufacturing, from minor levels in 1974 to

over 10 per cent of employment in 1989. What is equally notable is the
pervasiveness of the growth in foreign shares, which more than doubled in
every broad industry group shown here. While this growth is often viewed
from the U.S. perspective as a sign of American weakness, it was also a part
of a general move toward internationalization of production by firms all around

the world, in which foreign firms began to imitate the internationalization that
large American firms pioneered in the 1950s and 1960s (Lipsey, 1989). Even

at the end of the period, the foreign share in U.S. manufacturing employment
was not high compared to that in most developed countries except Japan and
the Nordic countries.
The growth in the foreign share of U.S. manufacturing employment

has affected all the main groups within the manufacturing sector, but it has
gone much further in some groups than in others (Table 7). Over the whole
period, the foreign share of employment in chemicals has been much higher
than that in any other industry group, a surprising fact in view of the strong
position of American chemical companies in world trade. In fact, the foreign

shares among these industry groups do not seem to bear any relation to the
competitive strength of American companies; they are no higher in the groups

in which American firms are relatively weak, such as foods, metals, and

miscellaneous manufactures, than in industries where U.S. firms hold strong

positions, such as chemicals and machinery. It may be that the foreign shares

are high in chemicals and machinery because the nature of these industries
leads firms from all countries to be multinational, and that it would be higher

if U.S. firms were not strong in these fields.
Two points should be made about particular industries. The fact that

the foreign share is so low in transport equipment and has not risen since
1980, although it clearly did increase before that, reflects two factors. One

is the lack of foreign ownership in the aircraft industry. That may partly
reflect the connection with national defense, but the international dominance

of U.S. firms must also be a factor. A second reason for the low share,
especially in view of the failure of the share to rise after 1980, may be a
classification scheme that places some manufacturing employment by foreign

car producers under wholesale trade because that is the predominant activity

of the U.S. subsidiaries.

The high foreign share in chemicals probably reflects the
characterization of DuPont as foreign-owned although it is not owned by a

foreign chemical company and is not part of a foreign-based chemicals
network. It is different in this respect from other foreign-owned chemical

operations, such as the Swiss-owned pharmaceutical firms and HoechstCelanese. The inclusion of DuPont, if it is included, has a major effect: it

would probably account for something in the neighborhood of 100,000

- 21

-

employees out of the reported 443,000. If all of DuPont, including petroleum

operations, is combined into this chemicals group, the degree of exaggeration

is increased by the fact that employees in the petroleum operations are in the
numerator, but not in the denominator of the fraction. However even without

DuPont, chemicals would still be the industry group with the largest foreign

share, by a large margin.

The large role of foreign firms in the chemical industry has long
historical roots, based on foreign, particularly German, companies' early lead

in chemical technologies. Mira Wilkins (1989) reported that "Foreign direct

investment had more impact on the pre-Worid War I American chemical

industry than on any other U.S. industry.. .in no other industry were
Europeans so far in advance of Americans; in no other single industry was the

foreign technological contribution so dramatic." (p. 383) and that "... by 1914

few branches of the U.S. chemical industry were untouched by foreign direct

investment. No other American industry was as influenced by European
business enterprises" (p. 411). "In the pre-war chemical and dye industries,

German interests were supreme" according to Lewis (1938, p. 102).

That large foreign, particularly German, role persisted despite the
confiscation and sale to Americans of German patents and property by the

Alien Property Custodian during World War I and a second round of
confiscations during and after World War II. Among the German holdings

before World War I, according to Wilkins (1989, Chapter 11), were Rohm

- 22
and

-

Hans, Heyden Chemical, Merck & Co., Hoechst, and Bayer. During

World War II, the Alien Property Custodian vested $51.4 million in enemyowned property, mostly German, that included American Potash and Chemical

Corp. and General Aniline and Film Corp. (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1948,

pp. 93 and 99),

and

in the years after World War II, vested another $58

million, part of which consisted of "...two large rayon manufacturing

companies..." (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1950, pp. 130-13 1 and 160).
In 1989, almost a quarter of foreign firms' employment in chemicals

(even with DuPont's employment included, if it is; almost 30 per cent if we
assume it is included and remove it) was in German-controlled firms. These

firms must possess some strong and persistent technological advantages to
retain their position in the U.S. and to keep regaining it after it has been cut
off.
Another view of the changing importance of foreign-owned affiliates

in U.S. manufacturing is provided by shares in plant and equipment
expenditures. While the employment measure in a sense overweights labor
intensive activities, the plant and equipment measure gives a high weight to

capital intensive activities and, possibly, to relatively new operations. The
foreign affiliate shares may be exaggerated by the inclusion of intra-company

transfers of plant and equipment that would not enter the denominator.
Since 1974, the foreign share in manufacturing plant and equipment

expenditure appears to have multiplied greatly (Table 8).

In several respects, the capital expenditure data confirm the story in

the employment data. The trend in the foreign share was very strongly
upward, although not quite as steep. The rise in the importance of the foreign
firms was evident in all the industry groups. The role of foreign-owned firms

was highest in chemicals throughout the period. In general, the foreign role
is greater in capital expenditures than in employment, but foods and electrical

machinery were exceptions in this regard. In the case of the chemicals
industry, the possible inclusion of DuPont in the 1987 and 1989 data could be

a major part of the high ratios. In 1989, for example, DuPont reported over
$3 billion in plant and equipment expenditures in the United States (Annual

Report, p. 49), a third of the more than $9 billion for all chemical affiliates
of foreign companies in Appendix Table 12. DuPont reported $600 million

of capital expenditures in oil and gas operations in the U. S. that year, but

some may have been expensed, and therefore not included in the capital
expenditure figures.

III. Foreign-Owned Affiliates in the U.S. and U.S. Trade
III. A. The Role of Foreign-owned Affiliates in U.S. Exports and Imports
By the end of the 1980s, foreign-owned affiliates had come to play

a large role in U.S. merchandise trade. They exported $84 billion in goods
from the United States and imported $170 billion, 23 per cent of U.S. exports

and over a third of imports. These amounts seem very large relative to the

- 25 shares

of foreign firms in U.S. production or employment, but they are so

large because much of these finns' export and import activity is as
intermediaries, trading in goods produced by other firms, not necessarily
foreign. More than half of the foreign firms' exports, for example, are by
foreign trading firms, classified as wholesale trade affiliates. They deal in

metals and minerals, and in farm products and other raw materials. The
former group is mainly Japanese and the latter is split between Japanese and

French affiliates. In neither group is it likely that much of the exports come

from the foreign firms' own production. One might guess that while the
foreign firms' intermediation provides some gains in efficiency, the exports
would not change greatly if these trading operations were closed. On the other

hand, the exports by wholesale affiliates in motor vehicles and machinery,
mainly Japanese, could have been the output of manufacturing operations by

the same firms in the U.S.
Imports by foreign-owned wholesalers are mostly of manufactured

products that would probably be imported anyway. The importation via
affiliates is presumably more efficient for the foreign manufacturers and
probably adds to their profits or their market shares.
If we assume that the exports and imports of manufacturing affiliates

are more related to their own production activities than are those of trade

affiliates, the trade of the manufacturing affiliates may be more likely to
reflect the effects of the direct investment. The amounts are still large, $31

-26billion of exports and $39 billion of imports by manufacturing affiliates in
1989 (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1991c, Tables G-5 and G-6). The exports

were 10 1/2 per cent of our rough estimate of exports produced by the
manufacturing sector, and 12 1/2 per cent of all exports in SITC groups 4
through 9. Not all of the trade by manufacturing affiliates is of manufactured
products, but the 1987 data (U.S. Dept. of Commerce 1990, Tables G-10 and
G-16) suggest that only about 5 per cent of exports and between 5 and 10 per

cent of imports are crude materials and fuels.

One contentious topic with respect to foreign firms' operations has

been their impact, if any, on U.S. trade. A suspicion is often expressed,
echoing earlier complaints against U.S. operations in Canada, for example,

that foreign-owned firms are disinclined to export, but have much higher

propensities to import than U.S. firms do.

It is not clear that such

propensities, if they existed, would have any implications for U.S. trade in
general, but we can ask whether the foreign operations are very distinctive in
their trade behavior.

It is true that foreign-owned manufacturing operations export more

than they import. At the earliest date for which we have data, 1974, their
exports were about two-thirds of their imports; by 1989, exports were 80 per
cent of imports.

The trade behavior of the foreign affiliates should be viewed against

the changes that took place in these years in U.S. trade as a whole. In 1974,
U.S. exports and imports, other than those of foreign-owned affiliates, were

equal. There was a strong downward trend in

the export/import ratio,

however, until by 1989 it was a little lower than the ratio for foreign
manufacturing affiliates. Thus, to the extent that the data for non-affiliates
reflects the general macroeconomic circumstances of the United States, exports
from the United States by foreign affiliates were facing unfavorable conditions.

III.B. Changing exchange rates and the trade of foreign-owned U.S. firms

One possible explanation for the change in foreign affiliate
export/import ratios is that the foreign affiliates have in some sense "grown
up" and have become less dependent on their parent companies for supplies
and components. That may be the case, but there are reasons to be skeptical.
One is that foreign direct investment in the U.S. has been growing so fast that

the average age of the foreign-owned enterprises is probably not rising.

- 28 -

Another is that the time pattern suggests the influence of another factor: the

U.S. exchange rate. The export/import ratio was highest in 1982, after the
low point in the exchange value of the dollar, and the ratio

was

at a low point

in 1986, after the peak in the value of the U.S. dollar. That influence of the

exchange rate is at least mildly confirmed by equation 1, which relates the

export/import ratio to the effective exchange rate of the dollar, lagged one
year, and a time trend.

The time trend is not significant, but it is positive, as we would expect from

any maturing of the investments. The coefficient of the effective exchange
rate variable is negative, as we expect, and statistically significant, as it would

be if a high price of the dollar discouraged exports by these affiliates and
encouraged imports by them.

If we suspect some J-curve effects on the import side, we might
include both current and lagged exchange rate changes, as in equation 2.

B? = .448

- 29 The use of both current and lagged effective exchange rates greatly improves

the explanation of the changes in affiliate export/import ratios and suggests that

both current and lagged responses to exchange rates are important. This

evidence fits with the finding in Lipsey (1991) that foreign affiliates
exports/sales ratios to a large degree and imports/sales ratios to a small
degree, respond to effective exchange rate changes.

The movements of the effective exchange rate over this period,
together with a time trend term, explain the export/import ratio of the U.S.,
other than foreign affiliates, to a far greater degree than they do the affiliate
trade ratios, as can be seen in equation 3.

where USEX = U.S. exports of merchandise minus exports by
foreign affiliates in the U.S.

USIM = U.S. imports of merchandise minus imports by
foreign affiliates.
The effective exchange rate coefficient is about the same for foreign affiliates'

trade (in equation 1) and for other U.S. trade (in equation 3), but the trends
are very different; the U.S. trade ratio has a strong downward trend over this

period. If we add the current exchange rate to the lagged exchange rate of
equation 3 we fmd that the current rate has the expected negative coefficient,

but it is not statistically significant. It does, however, improve the fit of the
equation slightly.

The ratio for non-affiliate U.S. trade, incorporating the effect of

lagged exchange rate changes in combination with a trend term, goes a
considerable way towards explaining the trade ratio for affiliates (equation 5).

In this case the time trend is again positive, implying that given the factors

affecting non-affiliate trade, or U.S. trade in general, the trade ratio for
affiliates was rising; the trend for affiliates was toward typical U.S. behavior.

A stronger explanation of the affiliate trade ratio is achieved by
adding the contemporary exchange rate to equation 5 (equation 6).

(6) EXAFF = -78.4 + 1.83 TJSEX + .039 YR + 4.28 EERt

The positive contemporary exchange rate coefficient here suggests a

J-curve effect, only for foreign-owned affiliates or larger for them than for
other U.S. firms.

IV. The Country and Industry Composition of Foreign Direct
Investment in the U.S.

IV.A. The Industry Composition of Investment
The longest continuous series on the industry composition of foreign
direct investment in the U.S. are for the direct investment position. While that

measure is related to the composition of sales, assets, employment, or other
measures of activity, the relationship is not always close. A given amount of

assets or employment can be financed mainly by parent funds or mainly by

borrowing in the U.S. itself, and the extent of financing through borrowed
funds could vary from industry to industry. In addition, the historical data on
the U.S. position classify the origin of the investment by the country of direct,

or immediate, foreign ownership rather than by the country of the ultimate
owner, as in some of the recent data.
One shift in the industry composition of direct investment in the U.S.

was the growth in importance of goods industries and decline in service
industries from 1950 through the early 1970s (Table 9). That change was
subsequently reversed, so that the shares in 1990 were quite similar to those

of 1960. Within these categories, petroleum first rose greatly in importance

and then declined even more, ending up at less than 10% of the total. The
decade and a half after 1960 also saw a rapid growth of wholesaling and a
decline in finance investment, both of which were subsequently reversed,
leaving both groups at the end slightly below their importance in 1974. One

consistent trend since 1974 has been a steady growth in investment in service

industries, although they were still below 10 per cent of the total in 1990.
If we compare the trends in the distribution of FDI in the U.S. with

those of US FDI, we can see several contrasts. One strong contrast is
between goods and services, with a large shift toward services in U.S. direct

investment and a corresponding decline in the role of goods industries,
particularly petroleum. Transportation and public utilities almost vanished
from FDI in both directions, although recent relaxations in host-country rules

against foreign ownership and the desire for capital investment and
modernization may restore some of the past role of these industries in outward

U.S. FDI. The major shift in U.S. outward direct investment was the growth

in the finance sector, from about 4 per cent in the 1950s to over 30 per cent
in 1990, from far below the share in foreign direct investment in the U.S. to
well above the foreign share. The data suggest that U.S. financial firms must

have gained in some respect on their foreign rivals over these 30 years.
A different view of the distribution of foreign-owned firms' activity
in the U.S., perhaps without some of the possible distortions of the investment

position data, is given by the distribution of assets. Assets do have their own

defects as an activity measure, giving greater weight to industries with high
ratios of capital, including financial capital, to labor than measures of output

or comprehensive input measures. They will, therefore, give a high weight

to affiliates in finance, even when banking is omitted. In addition, the

- 34 fmancial assets are much more likely to be outside the U.S. than fixed assets

or labor. An advantage of the asset data is that they are available as far back
as 1959 and thus give a view of the whole 30 years since then.
The most striking change in the distribution of foreign affiliate assets

is the enormous shift from goods industries to service industries, broadly
defined to include trade and finance, as well as other services (Table 10).
Goods industries accounted for over three quarters of foreign affiliates' assets

in 1959, and only a third in 1987. The sharpest fall was in the share of the
petroleum industry, followed by that in manufacturing. The corresponding

increase was not spread over service industries, but was concentrated in
finance, although some other service sectors did grow.
This shift in industry composition partly confirms that shown by the data
on investment position (Table 9) but the changes in the asset distribution were

far larger and show a much larger finance sector, even though the
investment position data include banking.

Orr's (1991) estimate of Japanese automobile production assets that

were involved in manufacturing, but listed under wholesale trade in the
Department of Commerce data, discussed earlier, would roughly double the
share of that industry in the total. The share would still be one of the lowest

in our list.

A measure of labor input is provided by employment in foreignowned affiliates. Unfortunately, the employment data cover only the second

half of the period spanned by the data on assets and the direct investment
position.
The employment data confirm the shift out of goods production and

into service production after the mid-1970s, as well as the particularly large
decline in employment in petroleum (Table 11). The rising fields for foreign
firms, according to the employment data, were retail trade and other services.
However, the employment data do not show the rise in importance of nonbank

finance indicated by the investment and assets data.
A comparison of the industry distribution of employment in foreignowned affiliates with that of U.S. firms as a group shows a much slower shift

from manufacturing on the part of the foreign firms, but much more of a

decline in petroleum, which includes some refining operations.

The

comparison also points up the much heavier concentration of foreign firms'
employment in manufacturing and in goods production in general, more than

twice the U.S. proportion by the end of the period. One can read this
comparison as a sign of declining comparative advantage of U.S. companies

in manufacturing, although not necessarily of the U.S. as a production
location, since the foreign firms were choosing the U.S. as a manufacturing
location. However, as we have shown elsewhere (Lipsey and Kravis, 1987;
Blomström and Lipsey, 1989; and Kravis and Lipsey, 1992), there is no sign
of any such decline in competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing firms in world
export markets. The rising share of foreign firms in U.S. manufacturing may

- 38 reflect mainly the increasing internationalization of the foreign firms.

The other side of this story is the much greater concentration of U.S.

employment in services, with the foreign share growing, but still far behind.
A somewhat different picture of the comparative advantages of firms

appears if we compare foreign affiliates in the U.S. with U.S. parent
companies. In this comparison we are holding constant not only the location

of production, but also the multinationality of the firms. Both sets of firms
produce in the U.S. and in foreign countries and are probably of similar size,

while the total of U.S. firms in Table 11 includes many smaller ones that are
less likely to be making a choice of production location.
The distribution of employment by U.S. parents is given in Table 12.

U.S. parents are more concentrated in goods industries than are foreign

affiliates, although parent employment, too, has shifted toward service
industries. Manufacturing accounts for more of parent employment than of
affiliate employment, but the margin has been decreasing, another suggestion
that the comparative advantage of U.S. firms relative to foreign firms has been

Among manufacturing industries,

chemicals are the industry in which foreign affiliates are much more
concentrated than are U.S. parents. Transport equipment is the industry in
which U.S. parents are more concentrated than the foreign firms. In neither

is there any clear sign of a trend over these 15 years.

Outside of

manufacturing, U.S. parents and foreign affiliates show the same rising shares

of their employment in the narrowly defmed service sector.

While labor input by foreign-owned affiliates receives the most

attention, we may also wish to observe the distribution of these firms'
additions to the physical capital stock of the U.S. Some of the trends observed
for labor recur in the capital expenditure data, particularly the steep decline in

the shares of the petroleum and mining industries and the rise in the share of
the finance sector, all always a much larger part of capital expenditure than of

employment. There were also increases in the shares of retail trade in plant
and equipment expenditure. This is an industry more important in employment

than in capital expenditure (Table 13). In manufacturing there was something

of a contrast between the employment and capital expenditure measures: a

small decline in the industry's employment share but a rise in its share in
capital spending. Those differences suggest more of a move to higher capital
intensity among manufacturing affiliates than among those in other industries.

Within the fmance sector, the major growth was the jump in the share of the
real estate industry during the 1970s. This is always, of course, an extremely

capital intensive industry, with a measured capital/labor ratio often inflated

by the fact that the labor input involved is employed by other service
industries, even when it contributes to the sales of the real estate sector.
The closest approach we have to an output measure for foreign-owned

affiliates over thirty years is total sales, but we cannot deduct purchased
inputs. In the earlier years we cannot even deduct imports, although that
would be possible for more recent years.

In 1959, the sales of foreign-owned affiliates in the U.S. were
overwhelmingly concentrated in goods industries, particularly petroleum and

manufacturing (Table 14). Those two accounted for over 90 per cent of all
foreign affiliate sales.
By 1974, almost half the sales were by wholesale trade affiliates, and

all goods industries combined accounted for only 40 per cent of total affiliate

sales. It is not clear whether there was a great change in the type of goods
sold. There may have been only a change in organization, to separate sales
from manufacturing activities, or possibly a change in the way the data were

collected. Within the goods sector, the changes were smaller, but there was
a shift from manufacturing to petroleum and, among manufacturing industry

groups, out of foods and into metals.
After 1974 the changes were smaller, mainly the decline in petroleum

IV.B. The Sources of Foreign Direct Investment in the U.S.
The historical data on the country of origin of direct investment in the

U.S. are based on the location of the immediate owner. Only for 1977 and
later years are there data on the location of the "ultimate beneficial owner,"

which can be different for various reasons including the tax treatment of
earnings by host countries.

In 1960, foreign direct investment in the United States meant
European and Canadian investment, with English-speaking countries alone
accounting for

- 45 over 60 per cent. The majority of investments were in large enterprises long

present in the United States, such as the branch lines of Canadian railroads,
Royal Dutch-Shell petroleum interests, and Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical

firms. The Commerce Department report for 1960 commented that "A
sustained increase in the role of flow of foreign industrial capital to the United

States has not yet developed and "The Department of Commerce, and various

States, are now developing programs to bring opportunities here to the
attention of foreign industrialists and other investors" (U.S. Department of
Commerce, 1962, p. 4). There is no indication here of any hostility toward
inward investment or any fear of its consequences, but more of an interest in
promoting its growth.
The country distribution of investment in 1990 presents some contrasts

with the earlier one, but some continuity also, and the later data are available

by the country of the ultimate owner rather than only the immediate foreign
parent.

The
from

U.K. share declined,

but less than might have been expected

the overall decline in the position of the UK in the world economy. The

importance of Canada decreased greatly and Germany and France became
fairly important sources of investment. The major new source is, of course,
Japan, passing the Netherlands in importance and second only to the UK. A
country that warranted only a line in the 1960 survey is now the second largest

investor of all.
The availability of data by the country of ultimate ownership reveals
some interesting contrasts with those by the country of the immediate parent.

The latter data are shown to exaggerate the decline in the importance of

- 47
Canada

-

and understate that for the Netherlands, because a change in Canadian

tax laws caused some Canadian owners to shift nominal ownership to the
Netherlands. Germany and France are shown to be more important as sources

of investment than the parent country data indicate. A large part of the direct
investment in the U.S. originating in the Middle East, and in Brazil (and other

South American countries), is apparently owned through intermediate
subsidiaries based in Panama, the Bahamas, and the Netherlands Antilles.
"Advantages to UBO's of holding their U.S. investments indirectly through
these countries may include minimization of taxes, avoidance of regulatory
constraint, and protection of privacy" (Belli, 1981, p. 63). Some examples of

Middle Eastern property holdings in the United States with intermediate
parents established in the Netherlands Antilles are described in a recent article

that also indicates that these intermediaries were shifted to the United States
for tax reasons after the passage of the 1986 Tax Reform Act ("Abu Dhabi's

Links With a Powerful Law Firm Present Problem for Democrats on BCCI
issue," Wall Street Journal, May 20, 1992).
The country distribution of sales in 1959 matched that of the direct
investment stock in 1960 fairly well. Companies from Canada accounted for
a little over 30 per cent of sales and almost all the rest were from affiliates of

companies based in Europe (Table 15). By 1974, only two thirds of sales

were from affiliates of Canadian and European firms and that share was
approximately the same in 1987. The very large share of the Netherlands in

- 49 1959,

most of which was in the petroleum industry, was greatly reduced by

1974, while affiliates from Japan, largely in wholesale trade, became the
largest in terms of sales. After 1974 the pace of change became much slower,

the main shifts being a reduction in the Netherlands share and a rise in that of

German firms.
The country of origin distribution for manufacturing affiliates showed

a little less change than that for all affiliates. The main difference was that

Japanese manufacturing affiliates played a much smaller role, remaining

behind those from the U.K. and Germany. Also, in manufacturing, the
European share remained, in 1987, higher than it had been in 1959. The main

shifts in country sources, however, matched those in the total: a large decline

for Canada, mainly before 1974, a large and steady decline for Netherlands
affiliates, and major increases for those from France, Germany, and Japan.
The distributions of sales by industry and investing country suggest

what the directions of comparative advantage were for companies from
different countries. For example, over 70 per cent of U.S. affiliate sales by
Netherlands-owned affiliates were in the petroleum industry in 1959, and the

share declined, but was still close to half in 1987, far above the average for

other countries (Appendix Table 15). Affiliates from Germany and the

Netherlands had exceptionally large shares of their sales in chemicals.
Japanese affiliate sales were extremely concentrated in wholesale trade
affiliates, because they were, to a large extent, involved in the distribution of

- 50 products exported from Japan. Within manufacturing, however, the Japanese

affiliates' sales were particularly large in transport equipment, reflecting the

strength of Japanese motor vehicle producers. For the United Kingdom, the
specialization in foods was above the average for all foreign firms.
Outside of manufacturing, Canadian firms had disproportionate shares

of their sales in insurance, in real estate, and especially in mining. Aside
from wholesale trade, fmance also accounted for a relatively large share of
sales for Japanese firms.
The sales distributions are an indication of the worldwide comparative

advantages of firms based in different countries but they may not reflect their

advantages in producing in the U.S., since large parts of the affiliate sales,
varying widely among firms and countries, originate from production outside

the U.S. The employment distributions may reflect more clearly the
advantages firms from different countries have in producing in the U.S.
The concentration on chemicals among German firms in 1974 stands

out clearly in the fact that 36 per cent of their affiliates' employment in the
United States was in that industry, as against an average for all countries of

under 11 per cent. The only observable deviations of even close to this
magnitude (many entries are missing) from the average distribution for the
world are of Japanese firms in wholesale trade and the U.K. firms in retailing.
By 1987, German affiliates in the U.S., while still more concentrated

on chemicals than those of any other country, had diversified, and were then

- 51

-

of far more importance than average in non-electrical machinery also.
Canadian and French affiliates were much more heavily represented in
machinery than were the world's enterprises, on average, and Japanese firms
had become exceptionally concentrated in fmance (except banking), as well as

in wholesale trade.

V. Financial Aspects of Foreign Direct Investment in the United States

For many years, most of the additions to U.S. direct investment
abroad have come from the reinvested earnings of U.S. companies already
established in foreign countries. Even as early as 1966-76, almost 60 per cent

of the growth in the U.S. outward stock was from reinvestment. The trend
has been very different for foreign direct investment in the United States.

- 52 Almost half of the growth in the foreign position in the U.S. in the 1950s, and

over 60 per cent in the 1960s, was financed by reinvested earnings. In the
1970s, however, although reinvested earnings grew rapidly, to over four times

the level in the 1960s, they financed only a third of the growth in the stock,
as equity and intercompany account inflows grew to eight times their level of

the 1960s.
The 1980s were again a contrast to all the earlier periods. Equity and
intercompany flows, particularly the former, grew explosively to over twelve

times the 1970s level.

At the same time, reinvested earnings almost

disappeared, falling from $14 billion in the 1970s to about $3 billion in the
1980s. In half the years of the 1980s the reinvested earnings were negative,
a cumulative total of $5 billion if 1990 is added in. Thus, while U.S. direct
investment abroad seems to have entered an era of mature self-financing, with
few new firms entering the list of overseas investors, foreign direct investment

in the u.s. in the 1980s went through a period of wild growth, financed by
inflows of new money.

The rapid growth of foreign direct investment in recent years has

consisted mainly of acquisitions of existing U.S. firms, rather than the
establishment of new firms. Comprehensive data from the U.S. Department
of Commerce exist only for recent years, but they do show a continued move

in this direction. In 1984-87, over 80 per cent of inflows of foreign direct
investment were for acquisitions. High as that was, the proportions for 1988-

- 53

-

90 surpassed them, averaging close to 90 per cent. The acquisition share was

even higher in manufacturing, usually over 95 per cent during these years.
The only industry in which the establishment of new enterprises predominated

was real estate, where 90 per cent of investment flow in 1984-86 and 71 per
cent in 1987-90 consisted of the establishment of new enterprises. Even in this

case there was a trend toward acquisitions.
Another indication that the investment rush of the last decade has been

very different from earlier foreign direct investment in the United States is
provided by the collapse in the apparent profitability of such investment.

While there are often good reasons to doubt published data on the
profits of segments of enterprises, which is what these affiliates all are, the

- 54 decline looks too large and too sudden to represent only a sudden rise in tax

avoidance. The very newness of the recent investments may explain some of
the decline. However, the predominance of acquisitions among recent foreign
investments means that these are generally going concerns rather than startups,

and on that ground alone one might expect a more rapid attainment of normal

profit rates.

The data for major industry groups show that the decline in
profitability was quite general, but it was much more severe in some groups
than in others.

profitability of U.K. investment and levels of profits in the last period for
Europe that were far above those of Canada and Japan. European investment
was more concentrated in manufacturing than those of Canada and Japan, the

latter heavily invested in real estate and banking. But this broad industry
breakdown does not tell the whole story; while most areas' manufacturing
affiliates remained profitable in the late 1980s, Japan's made losses in both of
the last two periods. Japan was also the country whose investment in the U.S.
had accelerated most rapidly in the late 1980s, a hint of a possible connection

between the rate of growth of investment and its profitability. Reports in the
press suggest that the declining profitability of Japanese direct investment in

the U.S. reported in the official data is not a mirage (for example, "How

- 56 Japan

Got Burned in the U.S.A.," Fortune, June 15, 1992). A summary of

a survey of Japanese-owned U.S. affiliates by a Japanese newspaper stated that

"...

80% of the 264 units weren't returning profits to parent companies and

63% cited earnings as their biggest concern" "Japanese Wary on U.S.
Operations," Wall Street Journal, June 9, 1992.

An examination of the low profitability of foreign affiliates in the

U.S. relative to other U.S. firms, based on tax data for the late 1980s
(Grubert, Goodspeed, and Swenson, 1991), attributed half of the differential

to characteristics of the affiliates and of the period.

The affiliate

characteristics were the revaluation of target firm assets following acquisitions

and the immaturity of the affiliates. Both were, related to the headlong
acquisition rate of that period. The main relevant characteristic of the period

was the decline in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar.

Some part of the rest of the differential was attributed to income
shifting by foreign firms to minimize taxes. That shifting was presumably
responsible for the fact that the proportion of affiliates with zero profits was

higher than the proportion among domestic firms. The part of the profit
differential attributable to income shifting is, in a sense, illusory. In fact, it

may represent an incentive for investment in the U.S. However, the sharp

- 57 decline in the direct investment inflow, particularly of equity capital, in 1991,

to less than half the 1990 level, reinforces the picture of low and declining
profits (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1992, Table M).

VI. Summary
The major development in foreign direct investment in the United

States over the past thirty years has been its enormous growth. That is the
case whether one considers the absolute values or the shares of the world's
direct investment flows and whether one considers book or market valuations.

The United States, which had accounted for a greatly disproportionate share

of the world's direct investment outflows in the 1960s, far above the U.S.
share in the world's income or output even at its peak in 1950, by the 1980s
was accounting for almost half of the world's direct investment inflows. That
share was even more disproportionate than the earlier outward share, given the

reduced importance of the United States in the world economy.

One consequence of this huge inward flow is that the United States
has become almost as much of a host to foreign companies as other countries

are to U.S. firms. Foreign direct investment in the U.S., formerly a quarter
or even less of U.S. direct investment abroad, is now, even by current cost or

- 58 market valuations, three quarters as large.

The rapid growth of foreign direct investment in the U.S. has left
foreign firms still controlling only a small part of total assets of U.S. firms
and employing less than 5 per cent of the U.S. labor force. However, the
shares have become much more significant in manufacturing, quadrupling in

the last 15 years and reaching over 10 per cent of employment. The most
notable share of employment has been in chemicals, over 40 per cent in 1989.

But the industrial composition of foreign direct investment in manufacturing

has been relatively stable; chemicals was the U.S. industry most heavily
penetrated by foreign firms in 1974, and as far back as 1900, as well as at

present. If we rank industries by degree of foreign control in 1974, no
industry moved more than one rank by 1989 except electrical machinery, now

the second highest at over 15 per cent. The foreign, particularly German, role

in chemicals, has a very long history. The level of German activity was high
even before World War I and has remained high even though it was reduced

twice by confiscations of alien property during the two world wars.
Another measure of the foreign role, the share in plant and equipment

expenditure, shows an even higher share - over half - in chemicals, but a

much lower one in electrical machinery. The foreign operations may be

- 59 entering relatively capital-intensive sectors of the chemical industry and

relatively labor-intensive sectors of the electrical machinery industry.
The trends in the distribution of foreign firms' activity among broad

sectors of the economy look different by different measures. The direct
investment position data show a large rise in the share of goods industries and

then, after 1974, a shift back to services, leaving the goods share a little
higher in 1990 than in 1950 and the service share a little lower. In the three

decades between 1960 and 1990, however, there was some shift towards
services. Data on total assets of foreign-owned firms show a much steadier
and stronger shift from goods industries to service industries mainly fmancial

services. The time series on sales suggest a very large shift toward services

between 1959 and 1974, but little change since then, while the shorter time
series on employment indicate a substantial shift out of goods and into services

between 1974 and 1989, despite the relatively small role they give to financial

services. Another short series, on plant and equipment investment, also points
to a shift in the direction of service activities by foreign firms, with real estate

the major factor here.
Foreign-owned affiliates have continued to import more relative to

their exports than U.S. companies in general, but the trend appears to be

- 60 toward foreign affiliates becoming more like other U.S. firms in this respect.

The foreign affiliates are quite sensitive to exchange rate changes in adjusting

the balance of exports and imports, but not more so than U.S. firms as a
group.

Perhaps the most publicized change in inward direct investment in

recent years has been its source. Japan, hardly mentioned in the 1960
discussion, now accounts for 20 per cent of the stock of foreign direct
investment in the U.S., second only to the British share. Canadian investment

has shrunk in importance. But aside from these two, there are many elements

of continuity. The U.K. remains the largest investor, as it was in 1960, and

for many years before that. The Netherlands is next (after Japan), and the
following three are Germany, France, and Switzerland, as in 1960, although
the order among them has changed and Germany is now the leader among the

three.

Data on shares of affiliate sales give a much larger role to Japan,
because of the importance of Japanese wholesale trade affiliates, and they give

a comparatively small position to affiliates from the Netherlands. Within
manufacturing, however, U.K. affiliates remain the largest single group, and
affiliates from the two English speaking countries account for over a third of

- 61 total sales.

One of the largest changes in foreign direct investment in recent years

has been in its fmancing. Whereas half or more of increases in investment in

the 1950s and 1960s were financed from retained earnings, the proportion
dropped almost to zero in the 1980s. The pace of new investment was too
great to be financed by reinvested earnings in any case, consisting to a large
and increasing extent of new entries to the U.S. market through takeovers of
existing U.S. firms, but in addition, earnings fell and reinvested earnings were

negative in many years during the 1980s. To some extent the poor earnings
reflected the deep recession of the early 1980s, and that of 1990 also, but one

may suspect that poor choices of investment targets, high prices paid for
existing companies, and the willingness of foreign firms to pay heavily for
access to U.S. markets may all have played a role. The steep decline in rates
of return during the 1980s also points in the same direction, although affiliates

from the Netherlands and Canada, two traditional sources of foreign
investment, also suffered sharp reductions in profitability.

Affiliates owned indirectly are classified by their country and
industry of operation rather than by the country and industry of the
primary affiliates that are their intermediate owners. The largest
effects are to increase the importance of petroleum wholesale trade
and of manufacturing and to decrease the importance of holding
companies.
