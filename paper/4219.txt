November 1992
A DYNAMIC SPATIAL MODEL

ABSTRACT

Any interesting model of economic geography must involve a tension

between "centripetal" forces that tend to produce agglomerations and
"centrifugal" forces that tend to pull them apart. This paper explores one such

model, and shows that the model links together a number of themes in the
geography literature. These include: the role of market access, as measured by

a measure of "market potential", in determining manufacturing location; the

role of forward and backward linkages in producing agglomerations; the
potential for "catastrophes", i.e.

,

discontinuous

changes in location in response

to small changes in exogenous variables: and the idea that the economy is a
"self-organizing system" that evolves a self-sustaining locational structure.

After a generation of neglect, the last

few years have seen a broad revival of
interest in regional economics. Economists
interested in international trade, in growth,

and in macroeconomics have all turned to
regional models and regional data. This
revival of interest in matters regional has
several sources.

First, regional economic issues, though
they faded from mainstream economics for more
than

twenty years,

are of considerable

importance in their own right. The importance
of the regional dimension has been driven
home by such events as the boom—bust cycle in
New England and the difficulties of German
reunification. So—called "spatial aspects" ——
a euphemism for the continuing poverty of

much of Europe's periphery —— are a major
issue in the discussions of economic and
monetary union in Europe (see Commission of
the European Communities, 1990)

Second, regional experience provides a
valuable laboratory for empirical work. Thus

In

particular, it is one place in which economic
theory can make contact with trends in other

fields of research. A number of economists,

notably Brian Arthur (J.990a, 1990b) have
argued that increasing returns and external

economies mean that real

useful these ideas will turn out to be in

scientists to attempt to make use of trendy

new concepts in nonlinear dynamics (e.g.
Wilson (1981))

the evolution of a multi—region economy.
Finally, Part 7 draws some conclusions.

1. The basic aroach

Any interesting model of economic
geography must exhibit a tension between two

kinds of forces: "centripetal" forces that

tend to

agglomerations, and "centrifugal" forces that

tend to break such agglomerations up or limit
their size.

There is a well—developed literature in

urban economics, largely deriving from the
work of Henderson (1974), in which a system
of cities evolves from such a tension. In
Henderson—type models, the centripetal force
arises
from assumed localized external

economies in production; the centrifugal
force is urban land rent. Together with
assumptions

There is a variant of this approach,
represented for example by Fujita (1988), in
which external economies are not assumed but
instead derived from increasing returns in a

basic approach unchanged, and still leaves
the spatial relationship of cities to each

different approach. No special assumptions

economies or nontradeability. Indeed, cities

Instead,

the only force working against

is the incentive to set up new

facilities to serve a dispersed agricultural
hinterland.

Many of the elements of this story have
been familiar to geographers for some time.
(Useful surveys of the geography literature
may be found in Dicken and Lloyd (1990) and
Chisholm

oversimplifying a rich tradition, we may
identify three main strands of literature
that bear on the approach taken here.

Closest in spirit to my model is the
literature on "market potential", begun by
Harris (1954) . This literature argues that
the desirability of a region as a production
site depends on its access to markets, . and

that the quality of that access may be
described by an index of "market potential"

which is a weighted sum of the purchasing

potential of region j would be determined by
an index of the form

7

where g(.) is some declining function.
Harris

showed that the traditional

manufacturing belt in the United States was,
for a variety of g(.) functions, the area of

highest market potential: while he did not
have an explicit model, he noted informally
that the persistence of that belt could be
attributed to the circular relationship in
which industrial concentration tended both to
access:
follow
and to create market

"[Mjanufacturing has developed partly in
areas or regions of largest markets and in
turn the size of these markets has been
augmented and other favorable conditions have

been developed by the very growth of this
industry." (Harris 1954, p. 315, quoted by
Chisholm 1990)

Market potential analyses have been a
staple of geographical discussion, especially
in Europe (see, for example, Keeble et. al.

1982). The main theoretical weakness of the

approach is a

lack of

microeconomic

foundations: while it is plausible that some

index of market potential

should help
determine production location, there is no
explicit representation of how the market

a

actually works.

A second, closely related literature
emphasizes the role of cumulative processes
in regional growth. Pred (1966), drawing on
the ideas of Myrdal (1957), suggested that

agglomerations, by providing a large local
market, are able to attract new industries,
which further enlarges their local market,
and so on. Other authors, such as Dixon and
Thirlwall (1975), have proposed alternative
similar
motives
for

dynamics. Such cumulative causation suggests
that initial advantages due to historical
accident may play a major role in explaining

the pattern of location. Like the market
potential literature, however, the cumulative
process literature lacks microfoundations.

Finally, we must mention central place
theory. Developed by Christaller (1933) and

Lösch (1940), this theory emphasizes the
tradeoff between economies of scale and
transportation costs. Central place theory
suggests that the attempts of firms to make
the best of this tradeoff should lead to the
emergence of a lattice of production sites
roughly evenly spaced across the landscape,
perhaps in a hierarchical structure in which

activities with larger scale economies or
lower transport costs are concentrated in a

9

smaller number of higher—level sites. Central

place theory has been a powerful organizing
principle for research, even though it has
well—known weaknesses. Most notably, not only

do next is introduce a formal model, with
complete microfoundations, that captures and

clarifies the insights of the geography
tradition.

2. Assumptions of the model
In any model in which increasing returns

play a crucial role, one must somehow handle
the problem of market structure. Traditional

urban models do so by assuming

taken here, however, involves avoiding, any
direct assumption of external economies:
externalities emerge as a consequence of
market interactions involving economies of
scale at the level of the individual firm.
Thus we must somehow model an imperfectly
competitive market structure. The workhorse
model of this kind is, of course, the Dixit—
Stiglitz

(1977)

model of

monopolistic

competition.
Dixit—Stiglitz
monopolistic
competition is grossly unrealistic, but it is

tractable and flexible; as we will see, it
leads to a very special but very suggestive
set of results.

We assume, then, an economy in which
there are two sectors, manufacturing and
agriculture. Everyone shares the same Cobb—
Douglas tastes for the two types of goods:

u =

where

CMCA

(2)

is the share of manufactured goods in

expenditure.

We assume that there is a single,
homogeneous agricultural good. Manufactures,

however, is a composite of a large number of
symmetric product varieties, with a constant
elasticity of substitution a between any two
varieties:

CM

(3)

In setting up the production side of
this economy, we want to make allowance for
both mobile
immobile
and
factors
of

production, which at any given time are
distributed across a number of locations j =
1, . .. ,J. One might suppose that the natural

thing would be to assume that labor and
possibly capital are the mobile factors,
while land is the immobile factor; and that
both mobile and immobile factors are used in
both sectors. To do this, however, we would
account
of

to

substitution in both sectors,

a major

complication of the model. We would also have

to worry about where landowners live. It
turns out to be much simpler, if even less
realistic, to assume that the two factors of
production are both "labor": mobile "workers"
who produce manufactured goods and immobile
"farmers" who produce the agricultural good.

12

Farming is an activity that takes place

under constant returns to scale; thus the

farm labor used in producing any given
quantity of the agricultural good at location

j can, by choice of units, be set equal to
production:
LAj =

location:

(5)

Let LA and L, represent the economy—wide

supplies of the two factors "farmers" and
"workers" respectively. We will assume that
these supplies are fixed. They are, however,
allocated across locations. A share
of the

farm labor force is in location j; we take
these shares as exogenous. At any point in
time, a share A1 of the manufacturing labor
force is also in location j; these shares
will evolve over time in a fashion specified
below.

At any point in time, then, there will

(7)

Next we introduce transportation costs.

For simplicity, we make some completely
unrealistic assumptions about these costs.

First, we assume that they apply only to
manufactured goods. Second, we assume that
they take the "iceberg" form introduced by
Paul

amount that arrives; then we assume

where r is the transportation cost and Dik is

the distance between the two locations.

Finally, we turn to factor mobility.
Farmers are assumed completely immobile.

14

Workers are assumed to move toward locations

that offer them higher real wages.
(No
attempt is made here to model the moving
decision explicitly) .

As we will see in the

next section, it is possible to solve the
model at any point in time for the real wages

paid to workers at each location. Let us
define the average real wage as

We have now specified a complete dynamic
model of geographic dynamics. The inputs into

this model are the parameters. , T, and a
(which turn out to be the only parameters

that cannot be eliminated by choice of
units); a given allocation of farm labor
across locations; a matrix of distances
between locations; and an initial allocation

15

of

workers across, locations. These inputs

determine equilibrium at a point in time, and
in particular the vector of real wages, which

dictates the changes in the allocation of
workers, leading to an evolution of that
equilibrium over time.

This sounds pretty abstract. Our next
step is to describe some of the features of
short—run equilibrium.

16

3. Short-run equilibrium
As a preliminary step to the description

of short—run equilibrium, it is useful to
recall two basic points about Dixit—Stiglitz—
type models.

First, in these models, the producer of
any one manufactured variety faces a constant
elasticity of demand a. Her profit—maximizing
strategy is therefore to set price as a fixed
markup over marginal cost:
(11)

Pu

where

is the wage rate of workers at

location j.

By choice of units we can simply say
that the f.o.b. price of manufactured goods
at j is equal to the wage rate:
=

Wi

(12)

Second, if firms are free to enter until

profits are zero, there is a unique zero—
prof it output of any manufactured variety,
which can be shown to be

17

=

(13)

Since all varieties are produced at the

sane scale, the number of varieties produced
at any given location is simply proportional
to that location's manufacturing labor force.

In particular, let n be the number of
manufactured varieties produced in the
economy as a whole, and let n be the number
produced at location j. Then we have
nj/n =

(14)

Equation (14) plays a crucial role in
the whole analysis in this paper. The logic
of the model depends crucially on increasing
returns, yet as we write out the equations of

returns will not be very visible. Where did

they go? The answer is that they are hidden
in (14). What increasing returns do is to
make it profitable to produce each variety in

only one location,

so that different

locations do not produce the same set of
goods but differentiated bundles of products.

When a location gains labor it does not
produce more of the same mix of products, but

the micro assumption does indeed have major

measure all prices and wages in terms of the
agricultural good. Then we have
Yj =

(15)

Next, we find the true or ideal price
index of the manufactures

consumers at each location. To do this, we
note

that in order to have one unit of a
manufactured variety make it from k to j,
exp(rDJ) units must be shipped, so the c.i.f.

price on arrival is Wk exp(TDJ). Given the

19

CES function (3), the true price index of
manufactures at j is therefore

T

=

[kxwkek)1]

(16)

Given these true price indices, we can
solve for equilibrium wage rates. It is shown
in the appendix that
=

[k Yk(Tke']

(17)

It is worth stopping briefly at this
point, to note that the right hand side of
(17) bears a family resemblance to the market

potential index (1) . Like that index, it
depends on a weighted sum of purchasing power
at all locations, with the weights inversely
related to distance. The difference is that
the true price indices also enter into the
index: essentially this reflects the effect

of competition from producers in other
which is missing from the usual
market potential approach. But there is a
definite affinity between the workings of
locations,

this model and the market potential tradition
in geography.

Equation (17), however, only determines

These equations are easily solved on the
computer —— in the numerical examples below,

I simply started with an initial guess at w

and then cycled (with some damping) over
(15)-(17) until convergence. In general,
they cannot be solved with pencil
however,
and paper. Yet we would like to get some
intuition about the forces in our model
before going over to numerical methods.

In order to do this, we examine a
limited question for a special case, before
moving on to more general problems.

In this section of the paper I ask a
question originally posed in Krugman (1991),
but which we can now restate in terms of our
more general framework.

get some useful

insights

into how the

parameters of the model affect the relative

strength of centripetal and centrifugal
tendencies.

What we do is solve (15)-(18) on the
assumption that A1=i, A2=O (the case where A1
= 0 is symmetric) . We ask whether, in that

case, the real wage that workers would earn
at location 2 is less than that at location
1. Concentration of manufacturing at 1 is an

equilibrium if and only if

To save notation, let's normalize the
distance between the two locations to 1. Then
we immediately find from (15)—(18) that

from any concentration of manufacturing in
order to get away from competitors.
This desire to get away from competition

represents the centrifugal force in this
model,

the

force

that works

against
agglomeration. By examining (21), however, we
see that when the manufacturing sector is a
significant part of tbe economy there are two

centripetal forces working to hold an
agglomeration together. First, the first term
in (21) becomes less than one. By referring

back to (18), we see that this term is there
because of the role of manufacturing firms as
suppliers of goods to manufacturing workers;

in effect, this is a kind of Hirschmann
(1958)-type forward linkacte. Second, the
expression inside the brackets involves a
higher weight on the component that is less
than one and a lower weight on the component
that is greater than one. This reflects the
point that the region in which manufacturing
is concentrated has a higher income than the
other location. Thus there is also a backwar

linkage in which manufacturing wants to be
close to the market that manufacturing itself
creates.

The parameter whose effect may seem
counter—intuitive to some readers is the
transportation cost r. Concentration is more

likely when transport costs are low. To see
why, we note the following:

eventually must exceed 1. In that case the
relationship between transport costs and the
real wage must have the shape illustrated by
the curves in Figure 1 (which are calculated

forT=.2,7=4, and.L=.2and.3).At
high transport costs a concentration of
production is not sustainable; there is a
range of low transport costs for which such a

concentration is not sustainable.
If (25) is not satisfied, the curve lies

below 1 for all values of r. To understand
this case, we note that a/(a—1) is the ratio
of price and hence average cost to marginal

cost, a measure of equilibrium economies of

If scale economies and the manufacturing
share are sufficiently large, workers will

prefer to

with

prohibitive transport costs.

Returning to the case where

(25) is
satisfied, we note that what we have defined

is a critical value of r, r, below which
concentration is an equilibrium. We may offer
some rough intuition here by stepping a bit

outside the formal model. Basically, when
transport costs are sufficiently low it is
worthwhile for manufacturers to concentrate

26

their production geographically so as to
realize economies of scale. Once they have
decided to concentrate production, however,

the optimal location is one that other
producers have also chosen. So low transport
costs foster agglomeration.

One might expect that concentration
would also be more likely the higher is j.

On reflection, it must be the case that
when transport costs are near the critical
level r* identified in Part 4, there is a non—

monotonic relationship between A and the wage

differential. Suppose that transport costs
were just at the critical level. Then the
curve in Figure 2 would have to reach zero at

either end. It could thus only be monotonic
if it were linear and indeed flat, which is

impossible given the non—linearity of the
model. This suggests why there is such an
affinity between models in which increasing
returns give rise to multiple equilibria and
the methods of nonlinear dynamics; I will not

try to pursue this any further, but simply
note that this model seems to illustrate a
more general principle.

Now that we have a way to look at the
dynamics of the model, let us consider how
the model behaves when exogenous variables
are shifted. To do this, we must choose some
variables to shift. There are actually only
four parameters in this two—region model: the

elasticity of substitution (which determines
the degree of scale economies), the share of

30

manufacturing, the level of transport costs,
and the.agricultural share of region 1. Given
the structure of this model both the degree

of economies of scale and the share of
manufacturing are parameters of tastes rather

than technology or resources, which makes it

somewhat problematic to think about what it

means when they change, so we focus on
agriculture and transport costs.

Figure 3

shows a calculation that

illustrates how the set of equilibria change

when we start with an equal allocation of
agriculture between the regions (i=°•5) and
gradually increase that share to 0.5?. As in

Figure 2, we

set p.2, a =

4;

the

transportation cost is set sufficiently high
(r = .335) so that the unique equilibrium is

initially with equal manufacturing shares,

but not high enough to make the curve
monotonic.

What we see is that as

rises, we first

see the equilibrium share of location 1 in
manufacturing rise. At a certain point two
more equilibria emerge: a stable equilibrium
with all manufacturing in location 1, and an
unstable interior equilibrium. This latter

We can illustrate the equilibria as we

In parts of the range there exist both a

others only one equilibrium exists.
Clearly,

changes in

there is a potential for
situations in which small
the exogenous location of

agricultural production make an equilibrium
untenable and lead to large changes in the
location of manufacturing. Such a catastrophe

is illustrated in Figure 4. Suppose that the

economy is initially in equilibrium at point

1, with all manufacturing concentrated in
region 1. Then suppose the center of gravity

of agricultural production gradually shifts
to region 2. At first, this will leave the
basic locational structure unchanged, as the

economy moves from 1 to 2. Any further
reallocation of agriculture, however, will
lead to a collapse of region l's dominance of

manufacturing, and the economy will move to
point 3.

We can give this catastrophe a name:
call it the "California catastrophe". It has

been argued by a number of historians that
the rapid growth that began in California
after about 1900 was a critical mass

and so on. That is almost exactly

what we see happening as we move from 2 to 3.

Next consider what happens as we change

transportation costs. Figure 5 shows what
happens as we gradually reduce T starting
from an initial position in which r= 335 and
= .504, i.e. in which region 1 has the

larger agricultural base. At the starting
value of r, there are two stable equilibria,

disappears. Figure 6 shows schematically how

the set of equilibria depends on r; again,

solid lines represent stable equilibria,
broken lines unstable equilibria.

Once again we have the possibility of a
catastrophe. Suppose that we start at pointi
in Figure 6,

and that r falls gradually.

33

Initially

this will reduce but not eliminate

manufacturing in region 2. Once the critical

point 2 is passed, however, a cumulative
process of decline sets in, even if there is

no further fall in T,

until

region 2's

manufacturing is eliminated.

We can call this the "Mezzogiorno
catastrophe". Some economic historians have
argued that the coming of the railroads, by

exposing the nascent industrial base of
Southern

Italy to competition from the North,

led to that region's industrial collapse.

Whether or not the story is true, this model
shows that it makes sense.

between location 2 and location 11 is 3.
How can we explore this economy? I have

35

adopted what we might call a Monte Carlo
approach: start the economy with a random
allocation of manufacturing workers across
locations, and then let it evolve until it
converges. We get insight into the model by

performing this experiment repeatedly with
various parameter values.
Consider first a base case (chosen after
=
some experimenting) in which
.2, r = .2,

= 4.

Figure 7 shows what happens on a
typical run of this case. The first set of
bars show the initial, random allocation of
and a

workers across locations. The second set
shows the allocation to which the economy
converges.

All workers end up in two

at locations 1 and
concentrations,
opposite one another on the circle.

7 ——

There are several interesting points to
notice here. First, it is evident that there

is a process of reinforcement of initial
advantage. Thus location 7, which starts with
the largest share of workers, is able thereby

to attract still more workers and eventually

take half of the total. This is exactly the
kind of cumulative process described by Pred
(1966)

The process is not, however, simply One
in which locations with larger initial work

forces grow.

A second city emerges at

36

location 1. Now while 1 had a large initial

labor force, it was actually smaller than
that of other locations, for example location

location 8. But location 8 was too close to
the winning location 7, and fell under its
"agglomeration shadow", whereas 1 was able to

match 7's eventual status thanks to its
relative lack ofrivals for its agricultural

hinterland. This is why the two emergent
cities are opposite one another —— and
therefore why the eventual pattern is one of
two central places symmetrically placed.
Does this case always produce the same
result? Not exactly. In many cases the cities

were not exactly opposite one another, ending

up 5 rather than 6 apart. Also, in a few
experiments the economy ended up with three

What do we learn? We have already seen,

earlier in the paper, how both the market

and cumulative process approaches

are more or lessvalidated in this model. Now
we see not only that the same approach can

produce multiple agglomerations, but that
something resembling central place theory
also emerges, because the dynamic forces do
tend to produce agglomerations that are
roughly evenly spaced across the landscape.

We may also, on a more mystical note,

observe that these examples illustrate,
albeit in a very simplistic way, how the
economy may be regarded as a self—organizing
system of the kind emphasized by Prigogine.
We start each run with no structure, only a

The study of economic geography is
important in its own right, and regional
economic data shed useful light on important

issues in other parts of economics. Beyond

39

this,

however,

study of

the

economic

geography can be a useful proving ground for
some ideas that may be useful in the rest of
economics. These include the importance of

multiple equilibria and nonlinear dynamics,

and the usefulness of the computer as a
theoretical as well as an empirical tool.

In this paper I have offered some
exercises using a simple theoretical model of

location. The model is patently unrealistic,
yet the results are strongly suggestive. We

see how economies of scale at the individual

level may aggregate to external economies,

how these external economies may lead to
multiple equilibria, and how the character of

equilibria depend in a

On a grander note, we see fashionable
"nonlinear" ideas like catastrophic dynamics
and self—organizing systems emerge as natural
consequences of the interaction of rational

equilibrium model with all the trimmings.

Thus it may be hoped that the study of
economic geography will help bring these
ideas into wider use.

APPENDIX: THE "MARKET POTENTIAL" FUNCTION

In this appendix we show how equation
(17), which determines wage rates in each
location, may be derived.

Let us refer to the c.i.f. price of a
good i at location k as

If the good was

produced at location, this c.i.f price is
(given our choice of units) equal to the wage

rate at j, multiplied by a transportation
cost factor that depends on the distance:

their income on manufactured

goods, implying

two manufactured goods depends only on

consumption of one good relative to another -

— say, good i relative to good 1 ——

is

Now consider the total sales of goods

manufactured at a particular location, say
location 1, at location k. (Because of the
"iceberg" assumption on transportation costs,

these sales will include the full value of

the expenditure of k residents on these
goods). There are

such goods, competing
with n goods from each region j, all selling
at the c.i.f. prices described by (A.1). It

is thus clear from (A.4) that the total
