CONTRARIAN INVESTMENT,
EXTRAPOLATION, AND RISK

ABSTRACT

For many years, stock market analysts have argued that value
strategies outperform the market. These value strategies call for buying stocks

that have low prices relative to earnings, dividends, book assets, or other
measures of fundamental value. While there is some agreement that value
strategies produce higher returns, the interpretation of why they do so is more

controversial. This paper provides evidence that value strategies yield higher
returns because these strategies exploit the mistakes of the typical investor and

not because these strategies are fundamentally riskier.

INTRODUCTION

For many yeazs, stock market analysts have argued that value strategies
outperform the market (Graham and Dodd, 1934). These value strategies call for
buying stocks that have low prices relative to earnings, dividends, historical prices,

book assets or other measures of value. In recent years,, value strategies have
attracted academic attention as well. Basu (1977); Jaffe, Ke√ºn, and Westerfleld
(1989); Chan, Hamao, and Lakonishok (1991); and Fan]a and French (1992*) have
shown that stocks with high earnings price ratios earn higher returns. De Bondt and
Thaler (1985, 1987) have argued that extreme losers outperform the market over the

subsequent several years. Despite considerable criticism (Chan, 1988; and Ball and

Kothari, 1989), their analysis has generally stood up to the tests (Chopra,
Lakonishok, and Ritter, 1992). Rosenberg, Reid, and Lanstein (1984) show that
stocks with high book relative to market values of assets outperform the market.
Further work (Chan, Hamso, and Lakomshok, 1991; Fama and French, 1992*), has

both extended and refined these results. Finally, Chan, Hamao, and Lakonishok

(1991) show that a high ratio of cash flow to price also predicts higher returns.
Interestingly, many of these results have been obtained for both the U.S. and Japan.

Certain types of value strategies, then, appear to beat the market.
While there is some agreement that value strategies work, the interpretation

of why they work is more controversial. Value strategies might work because they

are contrarian to naive2 strategies followed by other investors. These naive
strategies might range from extrapolating past earnings growth too far into the
future, to assuming a trend in stock prices, to overreacting to good or bad news, or
to simply equating a good investment with a well-run company irrespective of price.

Regardless of the reason, some investors tend to get overly excited about stocks that

have done very well in the past, buy them up, and these glainour stocks become

2What we call naive strategies is also sometimes referred to as upopular
models (Shiller, 1984) and anoise (Black, 1986).

4

overpriced. Similarly, they overreact to stocks that have done very badly, oversell

them, and these out-of-favor value stocks become underpriced.

Contrazian

investors bet against such naive investors. Because contrarian strategies invest
disproportionately in stocks that are underpriced, and undennvest in stocks that are

overpriced, they outperform the market (sec De Bondt and Thaler, 1985).

An alternative explanation of why value strategies work, argued most
forcefully by Fama and French (1992), is that they are fundamentally riskier. That
is, investors in value stocks, such as high book to market stocks, tend to bear higher

fundamental risk of some sort, and their higher average returns arc simply
compensation for this risk. This argument was also used by critics of Dc Bondt and
Thater (Chan, 1988; and BaIL and Kothaii, 1989) to dismiss the overreaction story.

Whether value strategies work because they are contrarian to naive strategies or
because they are fundamentally riskier remains an open question.

In this paper, we try to shed further light on the two potential explanations

for why value strategies work. We do so along two directions. First, we examine

more closely the predictions of the contrarian model. In particular, one natural
version of the contrarian model argues that the overpriced Liamour stocks are those

which, first, have performed well in the past, and, second, arc expected by the
market to perform weli in the future. Similarly, the underpriced out-of-favor or
value stocks arc those that have performed poorly in the past and arc expected to
continue to perform poorly. Value strategies that bet against those investors who
extrapolate past performance produce superior returns. In principle, this version of
the contrarian model is testable because past performance and expectation of future
performance are two separate and separately measurable characteristics of glamour
and value.

In this paper, past performance is measured using information on past

growth in sales, earnings, operating income, and cash flow, and expected
performance is measured by multiples of price to current earnings, operating income,

and cash flow. We then examine the predictions of the contrarian model, namely
that out-of-favor or value stocks indeed outperform glamour stocks. We start with

5

simple one-way classifications of glamour and value that rely on i easures of either

past growth or expected future growth. We then move on to the more theoretically

justified classifications in which glamour and value are defined using both past

growth 4 current multiples. In addition, we compare past, expected, and future
growth of glamour (and value) stocks to see if their expected growth rates are similar

to past growth rates and higher (lower) than actual future growth rates, as our

version of the contrarian model predicts. We show that a wide range of value

strategies produce higher returns, and that the pattern of returns, and of past,
expected, and actual growth rates are consistent with the contrarian model.

The second question we ask is whether value stocks are indeed
fundamentally riskier than glamour stocks. To be fundamentally riskier, value stocks

must underperform glamour stocks with some regularity, and particularly in the
states of the world when the margmal utility of consumption is high. This view of

risk motivates our tests. We look at the frequency of superior (and inferior)
performance of value strategies, as well as at their performance in bad states of the
world, such as extreme down markets and economic recessions. We also look at the

betas and standard deviations of value and glamour strategies. We find little if any
support for the view that value strategies are fundamentally riskier.
Our results raise the obvious question of how the higher expected returns

on value strategies could have continued if such strategies are not fundamentally
riskier?
We present some possible explanations that rely both on behavioral strategies favored

by individual investors and on agency problems plaguing institutional investors.

The next section of the paper briefly discusses our methodology. Section

Ill examines a variety of one variable measures of glamour and value, including

book to market ratio, cash flow to price ratio, earnings to price ratio, and past
growth in sales. It shows that virtually all contrai-ian strategies produce excess
returns, and motivates our subsequent use of measures of past and expected growth
in combination. Section IV then examines the performance and other characteristics
of theoretically superior contrarian strategies that are defined using both past growth

6
and current multiples. It shows that theoretically motivated contrazian strategies
produce higher returns than more ad hoc classifications, such as book to market.

These value strategies outperform glamour strategies by 8 percent per year.
Moreover, the superior performance of value stocks relative to glamour stocks does
not diminish if we restrict our attention to the 50 percent or 20 percent largest stocks
by market capitalization. Section V provides evidence that contrarian strategies work

because they exploit the extrapolation mistakes reflected in stock prices.
Specifically, the expected growth of glamour stocks relative to value stocks implicit

in their relative multiples significantly overestimates actual future growth. Section
VI examines risk characteristics of these value strategies and provides evidence that

over longer horizons value strategies outperform glamour strategies almost always,

and do particularly well in bad states of the world. This evidence provides no
support for the hypothesis that value strategies are riskier. Finally, section VII
attempts to interpret our findings.

METflODOLOGY
The sample period covered in this study is from the end of April, 1963, to

the end of April, 1990. Some of our formation strategies require S years of past
accounting data. Consequently, we look at portfolios formed every year starting at

the end of April, 1968. We ex.mine subsequent performance and other
characteristics of these portfolios for up tosyeazs after formation using returns data
from CRSP and accounting data from COMPUSTAT (including the research file).

The universe of stocks is NYSE and AMEX. Since we require 5 years of past data
before including a company in the sample, the survival bias inherent in the way that
COMPUSTAT adds companies to its data base is to a large extent avoided(Banz and

Breen, 1986).
Within each of our groups such as deciles based on book-to-market ratios,

we equally weight all the stocks. For each of our portfolios, we compute returns

using a buy-and-hold strategy for years +1, +2,..., +5 relative to the time of
formation. If a stock disappears from CRSP during a year, its return is replaced

7

until the end of the year with the return on a corresponding size decile portfolio. At

the end of the year, the portfolio is rebalanced and each surviving stock gets the
same weight. (A stock that disappeared in the previous year is no longer part of the

portfolio.) We also computed the results for 50% and 20% of the largest finns in
our universe. Such resuJts are more indicative of realistic investment opportunities,

especially for institutional investors. Moreover, focusing on larger firms avoids
potential selection biases in the COMPUSTAT data base.

For most of our results, we present size-adjusted returns. To adjust for
size, we first identify, for every stock in the portfolio, its size decile at the formation

time. We then construct a size reference portfolio so that for every stock in the
original portfolio we have a benchmark which is its size reference portfolio. At the
end of each year, we recompute the market capitalization for each stock and update
its size affiliation to obtain a more current size benchmark. In computing the return
on the benchmark portfolio we assume an annual buy-and-hold strategy. The annual

size-adjusted return on the original portfolio is then computed as the return on that
portfolio minus the return on the size reference portfolio.

In addition to returns for the various portfolios, we compute growth rates

and multiples for accounting measures such as sales, earnings, cash flow and
operating income.

All accounting variables are taken from COMPUSTAT.

Earnings are measured before extraordinaiy items, cash flow is defined as earnings
plus depreciation, and operating income is defined as earnings before interest, taxes,
and depreciation.

Let us illustrate our procedure for computing growth rates using the case of

sales. To compute the growth of sales in year -3 relative to formation, we consider

a portfolio that invests $1 in each stock, and look at the sales generated by this
portfolio in years -4 and -3, and use the percentage change as our growth measure.

In this fashion, we compute the growth in sales for every year prior and post
formation. The S-year growth rates we present are annual geometric average growth

rates. This procedure is appealing because it computes growth rates in accounting
measures in the same way as stock returns are computed. i.e., it gives each company

8

the same weight at the start of each year. Moreover, this portfolio approach to
calculating growth rates avoids the problems with outliers and with negative base

year values present in the more traditional approach where growth rates are
computed for each stock and then averaged.

Finally, we compute several accounting ratios, such as cash flow to price

and earnings to price. These ratios are also used to classify individual stocks into
different portfolios. For these classifications, we consider only stocks with positive

ratios of cash flow to price or earnings to price because negative ratios cannot be
interpreted as reflecting expected growth rates. For purposes other than classifying

individual stocks into portfolios, these ratios are computed for the entire equallyweighted portfolios, without eliminating negative values. For example, we compute

the total cash flow to price ratio for each stock and then take the average for the
relevant sample. This strategy gives us the cash flow per $1 invested in a portfolio
where each stock receives the same weight. Negative ratios for individual stocks do
not present any special problems.

ifi.

SIMPLE GLAMOUR AND VALUE STRATEGIES
Table 1 presents the returns on a strategy that has received a lot of attention

recently (Fama and French 1992a), namely the book to market strategy. We divided

the universe of stocks annually into book to market deciles, where book value ii
taken from COMPUSTAT for the end of the previous fiscal year, and market value

is taken from CRSP as the market value of equity at portfolio formation time. In
general in this paper, we focus on long horizon returns (of up to 5 years) on various

strategies. The reason for looking at such long horizons is that we arc interested in
performance of alternative investment strategies over horizons suitable for long term

investors. Moreover, we assume annual buy and hold periods in contrast to monthly

buy and hold periods assumed in most previous studies. Because of various market
microstructure issues as well as execution costs, our procedure produces returns that

are closer to those that investors can actually capture.

In Panel A of Table 1, we present the size-adjusted returns for years 1

9

through 5 after the formation (AB1 through AB5), the average size-adjusted annual

return (AAB), the size-adjusted 5 year return (CAB5), and the compounded 5 year
raw return (C5). The numbers presented are the averages across all formation

periods in the sample. The results confirm and extend the results established by
Rosenberg Ct al (1984), Chan Ct a! (1991), and

Fama and French (1992a). On

average over the post-formation years, the low BM (glamour) stocks have an

abnormal return of -4.3 percent and the high BM (value) stocks have the abnormal
return

of 3.5 percent, a difference of 7.8 percent per year. The extra return on

value stocks relative to glamour stocks is 4.5 percent in the first year, 8.3 percent
in the second year, 6.7 percent in the third year, 9.9 percent in the fourth year, and

9.8 percent in the fifth year. If portfolios are held with the limited rebalancing
described above, then cumulatively value stocks outperform glamour stocks by 38.7

percent over years 1 through 5. Without adjusting for size, glamour stocks earned

a five year return of 56.5 percent versus 112.1 percent for value stocks. There is

little doubt that, during this time period, the BM value strategy substantially
outperformed the glamour strategy.

The real question is what does the BM ratio really capture? Unfortunately,

many different factors are reflected in this ratio. A low BM may describe a
company with a lot of intangible assets, such as R&D capital, that are not reflected

in the accounting book value because R&D is expensed. A low BM can also
describe a company with attractive growth opportunities that do not enter the
computation of book value, but do enter the market price. Also, a natural resource
company, such as an oil producer without good growth opportunities but with high

temporary profits, might have a low BM after an increase in oil prices. A stock
whose risk is low and future cash flows are discounted at a low rate would have a

low BM as well. Finally, a low BM may describe an overvalued glamour stock.

The point here is simple: book to market is not a clean variable uniquely
identifiable with economically interpretable characteristics of the firms.

The more important of such economically interpretable characteristics are
the market's expectations of future growth and the past growth of these firms. To

10

proxy for expected growth, we use multiples of various measures of profitability to

price, so that firms with lower multiples have higher expected growth. The idea
behind this is Gordon's formula that C/P = r - g, where C is cash flow, P is price,
r is discount rate and g is the expected growth rate of cash flow. A similar formula

applies to dividends, earnings, and operating income, except that their own
respective expected discount and growth rates should be used. According to this

formula, holding discount rates constant,3 a high C/P firm has a low expected
growth rate of cash flow, while a low C/P firm has a high expected growth rate of

cash flow, and similarly for the ratio of dividends to price (DP), or cash flow to
price (CP), and of operating income to price (OP).4 In addition to expected growth

rates, we look at actual past growth rates of sales (SG), earnings (EU), operating

income (OG) and cash flow (CU). Because the book to market ratio does not
disentangle the past and the future growth, we look at variables that estimate the past

and the future growth separately.

Panel B of Table I presents the current multiples and past growth rates of
BM portfolios. The various multiples are in general much higher for value stocks
than for glamour stocks. For example, the extreme glamour stocks have a cash flow

to price ratio of .059, which is about one-third as large Is this ratio for extreme
value stocks (.172). This indicates that the expected growth in cash flow is much

higher for glamour stocks than for value stocks, or, put differently, that glamour
stocks are 3 times more expensive per dollar of cash flow than value stocks. But in

some cases, the most extreme value stocks have lower multiples than the less
extreme value stocks. For example, the EP ratio of the extreme BM value portfolio

is the lowest. This might be explained by the fact that the BM value portfolio

31n section VI, we compare risk characteristics, and hence appropriate
discount rates, of the various portfolios.
4Because of leverage, operating income is not a precise measure of cash
flow that accrues to shareholders. Consequently, we use OP multiples across firms
as only a rough indicator of differences in expected growth of operating income.

11

contains many stocks whose earnings are temporarily depressed, but are expected to

recover at least partially. The high expected growth rate of earnings of high BM
stocks suggests that BM is not an ideal way to define a contrarian strategy. Looking

at five year past growth of BM deciles shows that low BM (glamour) stocks have
higher past growth rates than high BM (value) stocks. For example, the past growth

rate of cash flow is 26.9 percent per year higher for glamour stocks. The same
pattern works for operating income (see also Fama and French, 1992b). The results
on past growth suggest that the BM strategy is similar to a contrarian strategy in that

it picks stocks with low past growth and avoids stocks with high past growth.

In light of the ambiguity of the interpretation of BM, we move on to
measures of expected future growth rates and past growth rates as perhaps more
direct ways to identify glamour and value stocks. Table 2 presents the results of
sorting on the ratio of cash flow to price (CP). High CP stocks are identified with

value stocks because their growth rate of cash flow is expected to be low, or,
alternatively, their prices are low per dollar of cash flow. Conversely, low CP
stocks are glamour stocks. On average, over the 5 post-formation years, first decile

C? stocks have an abnormal return of -4.9 percent per annum, whereas the tenth
docile CP stocks have an abnormal return of 3.9 percent per annum, for a difference

of 8.8 percent. Over the five year horizon, the difference in cumulative abnormal

returns between lowest CP and highest CP portfolios is 42.9 percent, and that in
cumulative raw returns is 95.1 percent. Sorting on C? is thus a more effective value

strategy by itself than sorting on book to market. If nothing else, this result shows

that there is nothing unique about BM as the basis for either a contrarian value
strategy or for a high expected return strategy.

The characteristics of C? deciles are similar to those of BM deciles.
Multiples basically line up with BM and increase with C? deciles. The results on
past growth are also in general consistent with glamour stocks having a superior past

performance relative to value stocks, although CP docile 1 stocks do not have the
highest past growth. This suggests that the low C? docile contains many stocks that

have had low growth in the past but are expected to recover, which are not the

12

stocks which a contrarian strategy would pick out. Sorting on CP atone thus does
not give us a strategy that is always contrarian to extrapolation either.

An alternative popular multiple is the earnings price ratio, EP. Table 3
presents the results for EP. On average, over the S post-formation years, first decile

EP stocks have an abnormal return of -3.5 percent, and tenth decile EP stocks have

an abnormal return of 1.9 percent, for an average difference of 5.4 percent. Over
the five year horizon, this difference in abnormal returns cumulates to 26.3 percent,

whereas the cumulative difference in raw returns is 67.1 percent. Low EP stocks
underperform high EP stocks by a fairly wide margin, although the difference is not

as large as that between extreme BM or CP deciles. One possible reason for that
is that earnings are very noisy and often negative, which makes EP a poor proxy for
identifying glamour and value stocks.

An alternative way to get at glamour and value is to classify stocks based

on past growth. The extrapolation story, as well as the evidence discussed above,
suggests that stocks with high past growth are typically glamour stocks, and stocks

with low past growth are out-of-favor or value stocks. We measure past growth by
growth in sales, GS, which is less volatile and less often negative than either growth

in cash flow or growth in earnings, particularly for stocks in the extreme portfolios
that we are most interested in. Still, sorting stocks into dediles by past growth rates

of sales is somewhat complicated. To reduce the noise from year-to-year sales
growth volatility, our classification of stocks into GS dediles is based on average

rank of their sales growth, rather than the raw growth number. Specifically, for
each company for each of years -1,

-2, ...,

-5 prior to formation we calculated the growth of sales in that year. Then,

for each year, we rank all companies by growth in sales for that year. For each
company, we then compute its weighted average rank, giving the weight of 5 to its

growth rank in year -I, the weight of 4 to its growth rank in year -2, etc. Finally,
we form deciles based on each stock's weighted average growth of sales rank. This
procedure is a crude way to both pick out stocks with consistently high past growth

13

in sales, and to give greater weight to more recent sales growth in ranking stocks.3

Table 4 presents the results for the GS strategy. On average, over the S
post-formation years, the low oS strategy earns an abnormal return of 2.2 percent,
and the high GS strategy earns the abnormal return of -2.4 percent. The cumulative

difference in size-adjusted returns over five years is 22.7 percent, and that in raw

returns is 61.6 percent. The value strategy outperforms the glamour strategy, on

average, in each of the 5 post-formation years. These magnitudes are not as
dramatic as those for the BM and CP strategies, but show clearly that a GS-based
strategy can predict returns. Note that when we confine ourselves to the largest 50%

of all firms in Table 8, the GS strategy works as well as the BM strategy.
An examination of the characteristics of GS decile portfolios reveals several

interesting results. First, low GS stocks have an annualized sales growth of -3.5
percent over 5 years prior to formation, compared to 12.5 percent for high GS firms.
The multiples generally rise as GS rises, except for decile ten where the multiples
typically fall. Some of the fastest past growth stocks are expected to slow down and

hence have relatively low multiples, which suggests that sorting on GS alone is,
again, not an ideal contrarian strategy. The pattern of other past growth measures

across GS deciles largely follows the pattern of GS. In sum, sorting on GS alone
gives us a strategy that works as a value strategy, but does not necessarily coincide

with an ideal contrarian strategy. This is exactly what we would expect.

The results in this section suggest several conclusions. First, a variety of
value strategies, based on both multiples and past growth rates, produce superior

returns. There is nothing special about the book to market strategy or any other
individual measure of value. Second, the one way classification strategies do not

appear to be the best way to identify glamour and value stocks, since they often

bunch true glamour and value stocks with temporary winners and losers. For

5We have also tried a procedure in which we did not give the growth rate

in more recent years a higher weight in the ranking, and obtained very similar
results.

14

example, low EP stocks, which are supposedly glamour stocks, include many stocks

with temporarily depressed earnings.

These results point to the need for a

theoretically better definition of glamour and value, which takes account of both past

growth and expectations of future growth.

IV.

ANATOMY OF A CONTRARIAN STRATEGY
Performance of Contrarian $trate2jes
For market participants to extrapolate the perfonnance of a given stock, they

must expect its future performance to be similar to past performance. This means

that a glamour stock would be a stock with high growth in the past

expected

continued high growth in the future. In this section, we continue to associate high
multiples of prices to earnings (dividends, operating income, or cash flow) with high

expected growth rate. Thus a glamour stock must have both high past growth and
a high multiple, not just one of these. A glamour stock must be distinguished from
a temporary loser, which had low growth in the past but is expected to recover and

hence has a high multiple. A glamour stock must also be distinguished from a
temporary winner, which had high growth in the past but is expected to slow down

and hence has a low multiple. A value stock must have had low growth in the past
and be expected by the market to continue to grow slowly, giving it a low multiple.
The principle behind the contrai an strategy is that glamour stocks are overpriced and

value stocks are underpriced given their risk characteristics, and hence an investor

should buy value stocks and sell glamour stocks. The question is: do such
theoretically motivated contrarian strategies work better?
Table 5 presents the results for the strategy that sorts on both GS and CP.

Since we are sorting on two variables, sorting stocks into dediles on each variable
is impractical. Accordingly, we independently sort stocks into three groups (bottom

30%, middle 40% and top 30%) by GS and by CP, and then take intersections
resulting from the two classifications.

Because the classifications are done

independently, extreme glamour and value portfolios (high GS, low CP and low GS,

high C?) contain greater than average numbers of stocks since GS and CP are

15

negatively correlated. The extreme glamour portfolio has the highest GS and the
lowest CP rank, and the extreme value portfolio has the lowest GS and the highest

CP rank. These portfolios are listed in the first and last columns of Table 5.

In an average post-formation year in this sample, the glamour portfolio had

an abnormal size-adjusted return of -3.3 percent, and the value portfolio had the
abnormal return of 5.4 percent. for a difference of 8.7 percent per year. In

post-

formation year is the average difference in returns between the extreme portfolios
below 8 percent! Over the five post-formation years, the cumulative difference in
abnormal returns is 46 percent, and the cumulative difference in raw returns is 99.9

percent. This difference in returns between the value and the glamour strategies
seems to us to be very large. It is larger, in particular, than the difference predicted

by the BM strategy or by the CP strategy alone. Interestingly, both CP and GS
contribute a great deal of explanatory power in these bivariate classifications. For

example, low CP stocks with low past sales growth, which we don't define as
glamour stocks, yield a positive abnormal return of .005, but low CP stocks with a

high past sales growth, which we do define as glamour stocks, have a future
abnormal return of -.029.
Table 6 presents the results for a classification using both past growth rate

in sales and the earnings to price ratio. The average difference in returns over the
5 year period between the two extreme portfolios is now 7.7 percent 1 year, which

cumulatively amounts to 38.6 percent over 5 years in size-adjusted returns and 104.2

percent in raw returns. The EP X GS strategy works much better than either the EP
alone or the GS alone strategy, although not quite as well as the CP X GS strategy.
By comparing these returns to the low EP low GS group, and the high EP high GS
group, it is clear that both EP and GS contribute to a better selection of glamour and

value stocks. Moreover, even though the results from sorting on EP alone were not

very strong, the combination of EP and GS works almost as well as CP and GS,
which suggests that in combination with a variable that distinguishes past losers and

past winners, such as GS, the EP variable in fact separates glamour stocks from
value stocks successfully.

16

Table 7 presents returns and other characteristics for portfolios classified by

BM and growth in sales. The results show that growth in sales has significant
explanatory power for returns even after sorting by BM. For example, within the

set of firms whose SM ratios are the highest, the average difference in returns
between the low sales growth and high sales growth subgroups is over 3% per year

(4.1% vs. .9%). A similar result holds for the other two groups sorted by BM.
Note that these results do not appear to be driven by the role of the superimposed
GS classification in creating a more precise partition of the firms by BM. The BM
ratios across GS subgroups arc not very different.

In summary, the results of this section have established two propositions.

First, the amounts by which theoretically justified value strategies outperform
glamour strategies arc extremely large.. In many cases, they arc on the order of 7
to 8 percent per year, and persist for several years. Given the failure of standard
fundamental risk measures to explain even small differences in returns, it is hard to

believe that 7 to 8 percent a year can be explained by risk. Second, the results
suggest that strategies explicitly constructed to be contrarian to extrapolation of past

growth produce higher abnormal returns than more ad hoc value strategies, such as
that based on book-to-market. This result suggests that value strategies might indeed

work because they are contrarian, rather than for some other reason.

Do these results apply as well to lar2e stocks?
One objection to this analysis is that, even though we corrected the returns

for size, the superior returns of value stocks over glamour stocks might come from
the smaller stocks. Larger firms, however, are of greater interest for implementable
trading strategies, especially for institutional investors. These firms are more closely

monitored, and hence might be more efficiently priced. Moreover, various market

microstructure biases in CRSP tapes and selection biases in COMPUSTAT tapes
should not be an issue with larger stocks.

Table 8 presents the summary of the previous analysis for the largest 50

percent of our firms. Our previous results still hold for every method of sorting

17

stocks into glamour and value, and Table 8 illustrates that for GS, CP,

cp x Gs,

BM, EP, and EP X GS. For the BM classification, the average difference in ret.irns
between glamour and value during the post-formation penod is 6.7 percent per year.
This difference for the CP X GS classification is 8.7 percent per year, which is the
same

as

that obtained for all stocks. For the EP X GS classification, the difference

in average returns is 8.3 percent per year.

We have also done the analysis for the largest 20 percent of the stocks,

which effectively mimics the S&P 500, and got a very similar spreai of returns
between glamour and value stocks. The conclusion is clear: our results apply to the

largest stocks as well.

ReEression Analysis

Previous analysis has identified a variety of variables that can define
glamour and value portfolios. In this section, we ask which of these variables are

significant in a multiple regression. Table 9 presents the results of regressions of
raw returns on the characteristics of stocks that we have identified. Recall that, in
our analysis, we have 22 portfolio formation periods. We run regressions separately

for each post-formation year, starting with + 1 and ending with +5. Thus, for post-

formation year + 1, we run 22 separate cross-sectional regressions in vich the
dependent variable is the annual return on stock i and the independent variables are

characteristics of stock i. Then using the Farna-MacBeth (1973) procedure, the
coefficients for these 22 cross-sectional regressions are averaged and the t-statistics

are computed. We similarly run 22 regressions for year +2, +3, +4 and +5 after
the formation. The results presented in Table 9 are for the year +1.

We use the ratios of cash flow to price and of earnings to price in the
regression analysis. However, for many stocks these ratios are negative, and hence
cannot be plausibly interpreted as expected growth rates. We deal with this problem

in the same way as Fama and French (1992a). Specifically, we define variables
CP + and EP + which are equal to zero when CP and EP are negative, and are equal

to CP and EP when they are positive. We also include in the regressions dummies,

18

called DCP and DEP, which take the value of 1 when CP and EP are negative,
respectively. This approach presents a crude way to treat observations with negative

EP and CP differently than observations with positive EP and CP.
The first result emerging from Table 9 is that, taken separately, each of GS,

SM EP and C?, although not SIZE, have a statistically significant predictive power

on returns. These results are in line with Fama and French (1992a), although on a
stand alone basis C? and not BM is the most significant variable. When we use the
dependent variables in combination, the weakness of BM relative to CP, EP and GS

begins to emerge, and its coefficient drops significantly. For example, when GS,
CP and BM are included in the same regression, the first two are significant, but BM

is not. Similarly, when GS, EP and BM are included in the same regression, EP

and GS are significant, but BM is not. The variables that stand out in multiple
regressions are GS and CP, the value measures stressed in this paper.

A TEST OF THE EXTRAPOLATION MODEL
So far we have shown that strategies contrarian to extrapolation earn high

abnormal returns relative to the market and to extrapolation strategies. We have not,
however, provided any direct evidence that extrapolation is indeed what characterizes

glamour and value stocks. In this subsection, we provide such evidence. The
essence of extrapolation is that investors are excessively optimistic about glamour

stocks because they tie their expectations of future growth to past growth, and
excessively pessimistic about value stocks for the same reason. But if investors
make mistakes, these mistakes can presumably be detected in the data. A direct test
of extrapolation, then, is to look directly at actual future growth rates and to compare

them to the pj growth rates and to the expected growth rates as implied by the
multiples.

The information on past growth rates of sales, earnings, operating income
and cash flow has been provided already. Future growth rates of the same variables

can be computed in a similar fashion for years +1, +2, ..., +5, and for average
growth. We can also compute the difference in past or future growth rates between

19

glamour and value stocks. To estimate expected growth rates, we come back to
Gordons formula, which, for cash flow, takes the form, C/P = r - g, where C/P

is the ratio of cash flow to price, r is the discount rate of cash flow, and g is the
expected growth rate of cash flow. Using this formula, the difference between

expected growth rates of cash flow of a glamour and a value stock is just the
difference in cash flow to price ratios of these two stocks, assuming that their
discount rates are the same, which we do for the moment. Similarly, we proxy for

the differences in expected growth rates of earnings and operating income by the
differences in earnings to price and operating income to price ratios.6 The ratio of
sales to price does not have the interpretation of an expected growth rate. Thus, for

cash flow, earnings, and operating income, we have a proxy for the difference in
cwected growth rates between value and glamour based on differences in respective
multiples.
Table 10 presents the results for two classifications of stocks, one based on

BM and one based on GS X CP. Starting with BM, the following patterns emerge

from The Table. First, as we know already, the past growth of glamour stocks by
any measure is much faster than that of value stocks. Second, the expected growth

rate of glamour stocks is usually higher than that of value stocks, although the
difference in expected growth rates is not as high as that of past growth rates. For
example, cash flow of glamour stocks has grown 26.9 percent faster than cash flow
of value stocks, but is expected to grow only 11.3 percent faster in the future. Also,

operating income of glamour stocks is expected to outgrow that of value stocks by

almost as much as it did in the past. In contrast, while earnings of glamour stocks
have grown much faster than earnings of value stocks in the past, the market expects

them to grow 2.5 percent slower in the future. Market participants thus expect
some, but far from complete, convergence of growth rates between glamour and

6R1l that operating income does not measure the cash flow accruing to
shareholders, and hence OP is not as theoretically adequate a variable in this analysis

asCP.

20
value stocks.

The most striking result comes from the comparison of

these expected

growth rates to actual growth rates. The latter reveal clearly, that, contrary to the
market's expectations, during the post-formation years, glamour stocks did not grow

faster than value stocks. For example, while cash flow of glamour stocks was
expected to grow 11.3 percent faster, it actually grew 3 percent slower. While
operating income was expected to grow 22.6 percent faster for glamour stocks, it
actually grew .4 percent slower. Most remarkably, while earnings of glamour stocks

were expected to grow 2.5 percent slower than those of value stocks, in actuality

they grew 38.6 percent slower per year. The expected growth rates show that
market participants expect glamour stocks to outgrow value stocks in the future,

though not by as much as they have in the past, and price them accordingly.
Contrary to investors' expectations, however, there is little persistence in the growth

rates. Given their expectations, investors are disappointed in the performance of
glamour stocks relative to out-of-favor stocks.

The results using the CP X GS

classification present a very similar picture. Again, glamour stocks have outgrown
value stocks in the past judging by any measure, including sales, earnings, operating

income and cash flow. The expectations of relative future growth rates are, if
anything, even more optimistic than the difference between past growth rates would

suggest. For example, cash flow of glamour stocks grew 15.8 percent faster than
that of value stocks, but, judging by the multiples, is expected to grow 19.9 percent

faster per year, and similarly for earnings and operating income. In practice,
glamour stocks indeed grow faster than value stocks, but not nearly as much faster

as expected. For example, the cash flow of glamour stocks grows only 2.7 percent
faster per year than that of value stocks, compared to the market's expectation of a

difference of 19.9 percent. Similarly, the difference in growth rates of earnuigs is
negligible, even though the market expects the earnings of glamour stocks to grow

6 percent faster. This result is very similar to that for the BM classification. The
market expects a much higher future growth rate from glamour than from value
stocks, and hence prices glamour stocks much higher than value stocks relative to

21

their earnings, cash flow, etc. In fact, glamour stocks do not grow nearly as fast
relative to value stocks as the market expects, disappointing market participants.
One other interesting observation emerges from this comparison of expected

and actual future growth rates using the (JS X CP classification. That is. the
difference in the growth rates between glamour and value stocks in the first year
after the portfolio formation is large, particularly looking at earnings and operating

income. This difference however shrinks rapidly over time, and in many cases the

growth rate eventually becomes higher for value stocks. Similarly, if we compare

the future growth in sales to

growth, we see the slow deterioration of the

relative performance of glamour stocks in all classifications. At the same time, if
we look at earnings, glamour stocks sometimes take a bath relative to value stocks

nght away. This evidence suggests that according to some measures the market's
belief about the continued superior growth of glamour stocks is valid in the short
run, even though for all measures the market is too optimistic about glamour stocks

in the long run.

In summary, the evidence in Table 10 is supportive of the extrapolation

model. The glamour stocks have historically grown fast in sales, earnings, cash

flow, and operating income relative to the value stocks. Market participants in
general expect these differential growth rates to continue, and in some cases to
widen, and price glamour stocks accordingly. In the short run, their expectations of
continued superior growth of glamour stocks is borne out according to some growth

measures, though for other growth measures the forecasts are too optimistic evenin

the short run. However, in the long run, the evidence shows quite clearly that
growth rates of glamour stocks either converge to the growth rates of value stocks,
or even overshoot them and become lower. This table suggests, then, that forecasts

tend to be tied to past growth rates, and at the same time tend to be far too
optimistic for glamour stocks relative to value stocks. This, of course, is precisely
what the extrapolation model would predict. In this respect, the evidence in Table
10 goes significantly beyond the customary evidence on returns in that it shows a
relationship between the past, the forecasted, and the actual future growth rates that

22
is largely consistent with the predictions of the extrapolation model.

VI.

ARE CONTRARIAN STRATEGIES RISKIER?
Two alternative theories have been proposed to explain why value strategies

produce higher returns. The first theory says that they do so because they are
contrarian to extrapolation. Section IV has produced evidence suggesting that indeed
value strategies constructed as contranan strategies produce higher returns than ad

hoc value strategies.

Section V further showed that investors appear to be

extrapolating the past, even though the future does not warrant such extrapolation.
The second explanation of the superior returns to value strategies is that they expose

investors to greater systematic risk. In this section, we test this theory directly.
Value stocks would be fundamentally riskier than glamour stocks if, first,
they underperform glamour stocks in some states of the world, and second, those are

on average 'bad states, in which the marginal utility of consumption is high,
making value stocks unattractive to risk-averse investors. This simple theory
motivates our empirical approach.

To begin, we look at the consistency of performance of the value and
glamour strategies over time and ask how often value underperforms glamour. We

then check whether the times when value underperforms are recessions, times of
severe market declines or otbeiwise bad states of the world in which the marginal
utility of consumption is high. These tests do not provide much support for the view

that value strategies are fundamentally riskier. Finally, we look at some additional

standard measures of risk, such as beta and the standard deviation of returns, to
compare value and glamour strategies.

Table 11 presents the results on the consistency of the performance of the
value strategy relative to the glamour strategy. We consider differences in returns

between deciles (1,2) and (9,10) for GS, (9,10) and (1,2) for CP and BM, and
between groups (3,1) and (1,3) for GS x CP over 1, 3, and 5 year holding horizons
starting each year in the sample (1968, 1969, etC). The results in Table 11 are based

on raw returns. The results show that value strategies outperform glamour strategies

23

quite consistently. Using a 1 year horizon, value outperformed glamour in 13 out
of 22 years using GS to classify deciles, in 17 out of 22 years using CP, in 19 out

of 22 using CP X GS, and in 17 out of 22 using SM. As we use longer horizons,
the consistency of performance of the value strategy relative to the glamour strategy

increases. Over a 5 year horizon, the value strategy does worse than glamour in
only 2 periods using the GS classification, and in NO periods using the CP, GS X

CP, or SM classifications. In this sample, over the 5 year horizon, the value
strategy was completely safe relative to the glamour strategy.

One could perhaps object to the raw return analysis since there are
differences in market capitalization between value and glamour stocks, and so the

size effect could be driving the results. Table 12 replicates the results in Table 11
using size-adjusted returns. Again, we see inferior performance of the value strategy

in only * few cases using the one year horizon, and in no instances using the 5 year
horizon unless GS is used as the sole classifier. The GS X CP strategy, which is our

preferred contrarian strategy, picks out a portfolio of value stocks that always
outperforms the portfolio of glamour stocks over a 5 year horizon. Incidentally, this

consistency result holds up also for both the iop 50 percent and the top 20 percent
of stocks by market capitalization.

Given that value stocks underperform infrequently, do they at least
underperform in recessions, when the marginal utility of consumption is high?
According to the NBER, there were four notable recessions during our sample
period: a mild one Dec 1969- Nov 1970, a very deep one Nov 1973- March 1975,

and also significant ones Jan 1980- Jul 1980 and Jul 1981- Nov 1982. An
examination of Table 11 shows that the value strategy did about the same or
somewhat better than glamour just before and during the 1970 recession, did much

better around the severe recession of 1973-1975, did somewhat though not a lot
worse in 1979-1980, and did significantly better in 198 1-1982. It is implausible to
conclude from this that value strategies do particularly badly in recessions, when the

marginal utility of consumption is especially high.

A second way to look at precisely the same question is to compare the

24

perf√≥nnance of value and glamour portfolios in the worst months for

the stock

market as a whole. Table 13 presents the performance of our decile portfolios in

each of 4 states of the world; the 2S worst stock return months in the sample based
on the equally-weighted index, the remaining 88 negative months other than the 25
worst, the 122 positive months other than the 25 best, and the 25 best months in the

sample. The results in this table are clear. Using every single classification, the
value portfolio outperformed the glamour portfolio in the market's worst 25 months.

For example, using the OS XC? classification, the value portfolio lost an average
of 8.6 percent of its value in the worst 25 months, whereas the glamour portfolio lost

10.3 percent of its value. Similarly, using every single classification scheme, the
value portfolio outperformed the glamour portfolio

the index in the months in

which the index declined. Using the OS X CP classification, the value portfolio lost

1.5 percent in the months when the index declines, compared to 2.9 percent for the
glamour portfolio, and 2.3 percent for the index itself. So the value strategy clearly

does better when the market falls. The value strategy performs most closely to the
glamour strategy in the 122 positive months otherthan the best2S. In the very best

months, the value strategy significantly outperforms the glamour strategy and the

index, but not by as much as it does when the market falls sharply. Overall, the
value strategy appears to do somewhat better than the glamour strategy in all states

and significantly better in some states. If anything, the superior performance of the
value strategy is skewed toward negative return months rather than positive returns

months. The evidence in Table 13 thus shows that the value strategy does not
expose investors to greater downside risk.

We have already shown that value rarely underperforms glamour for
horizons of 1 year or more and that the few instances when it does underperform do

not typically coincide with recessions. We have also shown that the relative
performance of the value strategy is not worse in "bad" states as defined by large

stock market declines. On the other hand, perhaps there is still a positive relation
between the relative return on the value strategy and the degree of prosperity in the

economy. Investigating this relation is akin to the approach taken by various APT

25

researchers seeking to give their factors a basis in economic theory.
Tables 14 and 15 provide numbers analogous to those in Table 13 except
now the states of the world are realizations of real GNP growth and changes in the

unemployment rate. The data are quarterly, so that we have 88 quarters in the

sample. These quarters are classified into 4 states of the world;

the

worst 10

quarters, the next worst 34 quarters, the best 10 quarters, and the next best 34
quarters. The quarterly returns on the various glamour and value portfolios are then

matched up with the changes in macro variables for one quarter ahead, since
evidence indicates that the stock market leads these variables by approximately one

quarter. Average quarterly returns for each portfolio are then computed for each
state.
The results in Tables 14 and 15 mirror the basic conclusions from Table 13;

namely, that the value strategy is not fundamentally riskier than the glamour
strategy. For every classification scheme, the value strategy performs at least as
well as the glamour strategy in each of the 4 states and substantially better in most
states. Unlike the results in Table 13, there is some tendency for the relative returns

on value to be higher in good states than in bad states, especially for extreme good
states. Roughly speaking, value stocks could be described as having higher up betas

and lower down betas than glamour stocks with respect to economic conditions.
Importantly, while the value strategy does disproportionately well in extreme good

times, its performance in extreme bad times is also quite impressive. Performance

in extreme bad states is often the last refuge of those claiming that a high return
strategy must be riskier, even when conventional measures of risk such as beta and
standard deviation do not show it. Overall, the evidence indicates some positive

relation between relative performance of the value strategy and measures of
prosperity, but there are no significant traces of a conventional asset pricing
equilibrium in which the higher returns on the value strategy are compensation for
higher fundamental risk.

Finally, Table 16 presents some summary risk characteristics of the decile

portfolios using our four classifications. These risk measures are calculated during

26

the post-formation penod using annual measurement intervals. For the extreme
value and glamour portfolios especially, the pie-formation periods exhibit unusual

behavior and hence might result in biased risk measures (Ball and Kothaii, 1989).
For each of our portfolios, we have 22 annual observations on its return in the year
following the formation, and hence can compute the standard deviation of returns.
We also have corresponding returns on the value-weighted CRSP index and the risk

free asset, and hence can calculate a beta for each portfolio.
First, the betas of value portfolios with respect to the value weighted index
tend to be about .1 higher than the betas of the glamour portfolios. As we have seen

earlier, the high betas probably come from value stocks having higher up betas,

and that if anything the superior performance of the value strategy occurs
disproportionally during bad realizations of the stock market. Even if one takes
an unreasonably strong pro-beta position, the difference in betas of .1 can explain

the difference of returns of perhaps up to 1 percent per year, and surely not 8

percent that we find. The evidence on beta thus completes our findings that
systematic risk, no matter how measured, cannot explain the findings of this paper.

Table 16 also presents average annual standard deviations of the decile

portfolio returns. The results show that value portfolios have somewhat higher

standard deviations of returns than glamour portfolios. Using the CP X

GS

classification, the value portfolio has an average standard deviation of returns of 24.1

percent relative to 21.6 for the glamour portfolio. Closer eximination reveals that
these differences in standard deviations may just be related to the differences in betas

we found or else to the differences in market capitalization of the firms in the
different portfolios. Judging from the average standard deviation of size-adjusted
returns, the value strategy looks no riskier than the glamour strategy, although both

are riskier than the more middle-of-the-road strategies. Fama and French (1992b)

obtain similar results for the BM strategy. Overall, it is hard to believe that the
small differences in standard deviations that we are finding can explain the 8 percent

per year difference in average returns.

27

VII.

SUMMARY AND TILE INTERPRETATION OF TILE FINDINGS

The results in this paper establish (in varying degrees of detail) three
propositions. First, many different investment strategies that involve buying out-of-

favor (value) stocks outperform glamour strategies and the market. Second, the

likely reason that these value strategies work so well relative to the glamour
strategies is the fact that the actual growth rates of earnings, sales etc of glamour
stocks relative to value stocks are much lower than they were in the past, or as the

multiples on those stocks indicate the market expects them to be. That is, market
participants appear to consistently overestimate future growth rates of glamour stocks

relative to value stocks. Third, using conventional approaches to fundamenta] risk,
value strategies appear to be less risky than glamour strategies. Reward for bearing

fundamental risk does not seem to explain higher average returns on value stocks
than on glamour stocks.

While one can never reject the metaphysical version of the risk story, in
which securities that earn higher returns must by definition be fundamentally riskier,

the weight of evidence suggests a more straightforward model. In this model, out

of favor (or value) stocks are underpriced relative to their risk and return
characteristics, and investing in them indeed earns abnormal returns.
This conclusion raises the obvious question: how can the 7-8% per year in

extra returns on value stocks have persisted for so long? One possible explanation

is that investors simply did not know about them. This explanation has some
plausibility in that quantitative portfolio selection and evaluation are relatively recent

activities. Most investors might not have been able, until recently, to perform the
analysis done in this paper. Of course, advocacy of value strategies is decades old,

going back at least to Graham and Dodd. But such advocacy is usually not
accompanied by detailed statistical work, and hence might not be entirely persuasive,

especially since many other strategies are advocated as well. Stilt, the ignoraIce
story is not completely convincing given the general popularity of value investing.
Another possible explanation is that we have engaged in data snooping, and

have just identified an ex post pattern in the data. Several of our results and other

28

pieces of evidence are inconsistent with this hypothesis. First, we have shown that
the theoretically motivated value strategies work better than ad hoc value strategies.

There is no reason for this to be true if we just found an cx post pattern. Second,
we presented evidence indicating that investors in glamour stocks overestimate future

growth rates relative to those of value stocks. There is no reason why this prediction

would be true if we just found an ex post pattern. Third, and most important, the
contrarian model has been tested, and confirmed, using data from other countries,
such as Japan (Chan, Hamao, and Lakonishok, 1991). The same coincidence is less
likely to materialize in multiple countries.

We conjecture that the results in this paper can best be explained by the
preference of both individual and institutional investors for glamour strategies and

by their avoidance of value strategies. Below we suggest some reasons for this
preference, which might potentially explain the obsePved returns anomaly.

Individual investors might focus on glamour strategies for a variety of
reasons. First, they may make judgment errors and extrapolate past growth rates of
glamour stocks, such as WALMART or Home Depot, even when such growth rates

are highly unlikely to persist in the future. Putting excessive weight on recent past
history, as opposed to a rational prior, is a common judgment error in psychological

experiments, and not just in the stock market. Alternatively, individuals might just
equate well-run firms with good investments regardless of price. After all, how can

you lose money on Microsoft or Walmart? Indeed, brokers always recommend
"good" companies, with "steady" earnings and dividend growth.
Presumably, the institutional investors should be somewhat more free from

judgment biases and excitement about "good companies" than individuals, and so
should flock to value strategies. But for several reasons, institutional investors might

themselves prefer glamour stocks even if they were less afflicted by extrapolation
biases than individuals, which is far from certain. The reason is the agency context

of institutional money management (see Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1992).

For example, institutions might preler glamour stocks because they appear to be
"prudent" investments, and hence are easy to justify to sponsors, who erroneously

29

equate good companies with good investments. Glamour stocks have done well in

the past, and are unlikely to become financially distressed in the near future, as
opposed to value stocks, which have previously done poorly and are more likely to

run into financial problems. Many institutions actually screen out stocks of
financially distressed firms, many of which are value stocks, from the universe of

stocks they pick. Indeed, sponsors (because they themselves extrapolate) might
consider glamour stocks to be safer than value stocks, even though, as we have seen,

a portfolio of value stocks is actually less risky. The strategy of investing in
glamour stocks, while appearing prudent, is not prudent at all in that it earns a
lower expected return and is not fundamentally less risky. Nonetheless, the agency
problems between money managers and their sponsors would cause money managers

to tilt towards glamour stocks (Lakonishok et ii, 1992).
Another important factor is that most investors have shorter time horizons
than are required for value strategies to consistently pay off. Many individuals look
for stocks that will earn them high abnormal returns within a few months, rather than

4 percent per year over the next five years. Institutional money managers often have

even shorter time horizons. They often cannot afford to underperform the index or

their peers for any non-trivial period of time, for if they do, their sponsors will
withdraw the funds. A value strategy that takes 3 to 5 years topsy off but may
underperform the market in the meantime (have a large tracking error) might simply

be too risky for money managers from the viewpoint of career concerns. If a money
manager fears getting fired before a value strategy pays off, he will avoid using such

a strategy. When both individuals and institutional money managers prefer glamour

and avoid value strategies, value stocks will be cheap and earn a higher average
return.

Are the anomalous excess returns on value stocks likely to persist? It is
possible chat over time more investors will become convinced of the value of being

a contrarian with a long horizon and the returns to our strategies will fall. Perhaps
the recent move into disciplined quantitative investment strategies, evaluated based
only on performance and not on individual stock picks, will increase the demand for

30

value stocks and reduce the agency problems that result in picking glamour stocks.

Finally, the rapidly growing mutual funds are likely to be important investors
pursuing value strategies, since they face less pressure to pick glamour stocks for

clients than are many investment advisors of pension funds. All of these factors
might reduce the future returns to value strategies as such strategies become less
con ti-a ri an

Perhaps the most interesting implication of the conjecture that many of the

glamour stock investors are money managers is that this may explain their inferior
performance. In an earlier paper, we have focused on the striking underperformance
of pension fund money managers relative to the market index (Lakonishok, Shleifer,

and Vishny, 1992). The large difference in returns on glamour and value can at
least in principle explain how money managers can underperform the market by over

100 basis points per year before accounting for management fees. By looking at the
actual portfolios of institutional money managers, one can find out whether they are

ovennvested in glamour stocks and underinvested in value stocks. We plan to do
that in a follow-up paper.

Pan.f 2: At the end of each April between 1968 and 1989. 10 decile portfolios are formed based on

the ratio of prey us-yeer's-cash.flow.to.end.oI-April.maket.yaau..of.qu (C?). For each docile
portfolio (changing ivry April), panel 2 presents its averag, return in the quarter prior to the toworst. 34-next, 34-n.xt. and 10-best quarters ranked by unemployment growth.
Panel 3: At th. end of each April between 1968 and 1989. 9 groups of stocks are formed as follows.
All stocks are Independently sorted into 3 groups (bo6om 30%, middle 40%. sod top 30%) by th.
ratio of previous-year's.cash.floto-end.ol.April.ma ke value-of.equity (CP) and by the preformation5-year-weighlerl-averagI-rank.of-sales.growtJ (GS). The 9 portfolios are Intersections resulting from
these 2 indepindent classifications. For each portfolio (changing evify April), panel 3 presents its
average return in the quarter prior to the 10-worst, 34-next. 34-next, md ID-best quarters ranked by
unemployment growth.
Panel 4: At the end of each April between 1966 and 1989. 10 docile portfolios are 104-med based on

TABIE 16: Risk Characteristics of Portfolios

For each portfolio described below, we compule using 22.y.ar-afle.th.- formation returns as observations of its
beta with respect to the valu.-wighted index, We also compute using the 22-foqmat ion periods the standard
deviation of returns and th. standard deviation of abnormal returns in the year after formalion.
Panel I: At the end of each April between 1966 and 1969. 10 docile portfolios are formed based on the pre
formation.5.year.we,ghted.average-raflk-Of-S.aleS-grOWlh (CS). For each decile portfolio, panel t presents Is
beta. standard deviation of returns, and standard deviation of abnormal returns defined above.
Panel 2: Al the end of each April between 1968and 1989. 10 decile portfolios are formed based on the ratio of
provious-year's-cash-flow-lo-end.ol-APrd-market'ValUOo-eqUity (CP). For each docile pottOlio, panel 2 presents
its beta, standard deviation of returns, and standard deviation of abnormal returns defined above.
Panel 3: At the end of each April between 1968 and 1989. 9 groups of stocks are formed as follows. All stocks
are independently sorted into 3 group, (bottom 30%. middle 40%, and top 30%) by th, ratio of previous-year'scash.flow-to-end-of-April-market-value-of-equity (CP) and by the pre-formation-5-year.weighted-average-rank-ofsales-growth (GS). The 9 portfolios are intersections resulting from these 2 independent classifications. For
each group of stocks, panel 3 presents its beta, standard deviation of returns, and standard deviation of
abnormal returns defined above.

Panel 4: At the end of each April between 1968 and 1989, 10 dec11, portfolios are formed based on the ratio of
end.ol.pr.vus-ye.r's-book-value-ol..quity'to-end.of.April.market-value-of-equity (SM). For .ach dec11. portfolio.
panel 4 presents its beta, standard deviation of eturns. and standard deviation of abnormal returns defined
above.
