DID TIIE IDATCHER REFORMS
CHANGE BRITISH LABOUR
PERFORMANCE?

ABSTRACT

In this paper we evaluate the success of policies that were implemented in the 1980s that were
designed to improve the workings of the UK labour market. Our primary conclusion is that the
Thatcherite reforms succeeded in their goals of weakening union power; may have marginally
increased employment and wage responsiveness to market conditions and may have increased
self-employment. They were accompanied by a substantial improvement in the labour market
position of women. But the reforms failed to improve the responsiveness of real wages to
unemployment; they were associated with a slower transition from nonemployment to
employment for men; a devastating loss in full-time jobs for male workers and produced
substantial seemingly noncompetitive increases in earnings inequality.
