LANGUAGE, EMPLOYMENT, AND
EARNINGS IN THE UNITED STATES:
SPANISH-ENGLISH DIFFERENTIALS
FROM 1970 TO 1990

ABSTRACT
This paper analyzes employment and earnings differentials between Spanish speakers and

English speakers in the United States, using data from the 1970, 1980. and 1990 U.S. censuses.
The results show that Spanish speakers, both men and women, do not perform as well in the

labor market as English speakers. The results also reveal that Spanish-English earnings and
unemployment differentials increased slightly in the 1970s, most likely because of rapid growth

in the number of Spanish speakers. By contrast, these differentials increased sharply in the

1980s, also a period of rapidly increasing supply. However, there is no evidence that the
widening of differentials in the I 980s reflects an increase in the labor market rewards to English

language proficiency. Rather, they appear to be the result of Spanish speakers having relatively
little of those labor market characteristics, most notably education1 whose market value increased

dramatically during the 1980s.

Earning, in the United States:
spanish-English Differential, from 1970 to 1990

Language, Employment, and

People of Hispanic origin constitute the largest ethnic minority in the
United States. One important characteristic of most members of this
minority is that their native tongue, Spanish. is not the major language of
the United States labor market. Although Hispanics will have an advantage
in those jobs that require Spanish, problems with spoken English may delay

their

integration into the mainstream economy and affect their economic

well-being.
Many investigators

have studied the economic status of Hispanic

Americans. Recent studies have generally found that language skill, or more

precisely, a deficiency in being able to cotranunicate in English, is an
important factor in explaining the relatively low earnings of Hispanic
Americans. Most of this research is based on the Survey of Income and
Education (SIE), a large sample survey conducted by the U.S.
Census

in 1976 that contains

important source of data for studying Hispanic Americans is U.S.

population censuses, which contain direct information on language starting
in 1980, though not in as much detail as in the SIB. However, an important
advantage of census data over the SIE is that they permit researchers to
make comparisons over time.
The purpose of this paper is to measure and analyze employment and
earnings gaps between English speakers and Hispanics/Spanish speakers using

data from successive U.S. censuses. In so doing, we extend our earlier work
(Bloom and Grenier 1992a) and the existing literature by including data from

the 1990 census and by analyzing earnings gaps among women. Since
relatively few datasets that include measures of individuals' labor market

characteristics and outcomes contain direct information on individuals'
mother tongue, spoken language, language proficiency, and so on, studies of
the labor market effects of language skills often assume a close connection
between language and ethnicity and use the latter, which is reported in most

surveys, as an indicator of the former. Empirical support for the use of
Hispanic ethnicity as a proxy for Spanish mother tongue is provided in Bloom
and Grenier (l992a)

The paper begins with a brief survey of the economic literature on

earnings

gaps

between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites in the United States

(i.e., Spanish-English earnings gaps)

It

then describes the conceptual

framework we use to guide our empirical analyses. It continues with a
description of the data and a presentation and discussion of the empirical
results.

Rsvi.w of th. Literaturs
Economists generally treat language as a kind of "human capital," which
can be developed in the same way that individuals develop other productive

For example, individuals can acquire or

skills (Bloom and Grenier 1992b) .

improve their language abilities by attending school, conversing with

others, engaging in self-study, and so forth. Although most people
corununicate predominantly in their mother tongue throughout their lives,

learning another language is not uncommon. Members of linguistic minorities
are particularly likely to acquire the dominant language of thesociety in
which they live. What is significant for economists is that the development
of language skills is not without costs. Learning a language typically
requires resources to pay for instruction and materials and, perhaps more
important, the conunitment of time, which also has value. As a basic
proposition of economic analysis is that individuals respond to incentives,

2

economists generally believe that individuals seek to acquire those language

skills whose expected financial benefits exceed their expected costs. The
anticipation of various nonpecuniary benefits, for example, widening
intellectual horizons or gaining social acceptance, though difficult to

measure, will also play a role in these decisions.
In 1969, the average annual earnings of prime-age Hispanic men in the

U.S. were 32 percent lower than for non-Hispanic white men. By 1989 the
shortfall had risen to 39 percent. The size of this differential has
stimulated a great deal of economic research over the years (and also of
sociological research, although that literature is not reviewed here) .

In

examining this research, it is useful to divide the economic studies on the
earnings

of Hispanic Americans into three generations. The first

generation, which consists of studies done mainly during
l970s, analyzed gross earnings gaps between

the

1960s and early

Hispanics (typically just

Mexicans) and non-Hispanics. These studies usually considered only one
major cause of the earnings gap: differences in educational attainment.
The second generation of studies, carried out from the mid-l9lOs to the
early l980s, used multiple regression analysis to examine the role of a
longer list of labor market characteristics, such as age, marital status.

and region of residence, in addition to educational attainment, to explain
earnings

gaps between non-Hispanics and the different Hispanic subgroups.

Although

none of the first or second generation studies had language

ability, per Se, as a central focus of analysis, mainly because of data
limitations, we review them here because they provide the intellectual roots
for

more recent labor market research that

focuses directly on language

ability. Finally, the third generation of studies, those conducted from the
early l960s on, emphasized the role of English language skills as an

3

independent and potentially important determinant of earnings and other
labor market outcomes.

First-Generation Studies
Fogel's (1966) study is perhaps the earliest attempt to provide an
analytical explanation for the relatively low earnings of Hispanic

Americans. Using a sample of men from the 1960 U.S. census,

average incomes. One of his key findings was that differences in
educational attainment accounted for a sizeable portion of the differences
in

median

income, especially for Mexicans.

Adopting a similar approach, Poston, Alvirez, and Tienda (1976)
decomposed earnings differences between non-Hispanics and Mexicans into a
portion due to differences in schooling and a portion due to differences in
the labor market reward for schooling (i.e., the schooling coefficient in
multiple regression analysis)

Comparing data from the 1960 and 1970 U.S.

censuses, they found that the portion of the earnings difference due to

differential labor market rewards assigned to schooling for Hispanics and
non-Hispanics increased during the 19605.

Carliner (1976) used data from the 1970 Current Population Survey to
estimate rates of return to years of schooling for Whites, Blacks, and

different Hispanic groups. He found that the rate of return to education
was about two percentage points lower for Mexicans than for Whites. Rates
of return to schooling were also lower for Blacks relative to whites, but
they were higher for Cubans

and

for Central and South Americans. For Puerto

Ricans and other Spanish-speaking groups, they were about the same as those

4

for Whites. These results must be interpreted with caution, however,

because

some of Carliner's

samples were

quite

small.

Studies

The second generation of studies combined the economic theory of human

capital

with multivariate statistical techniques to assess the contribution

to earnings differences of multiple characteristics of workers in addition

to their education. For example, using a sample of male workers from the
1970 U.S. census, Long (1977) decomposed White-Hispanic earnings
differentials into portions due to differences in workers' characteristics

and differences in the labor market rewards assigned to those
characteristics. The characteristics he considered include education, age,

region of residence, marital status, and hours worked. His results also
revealed higher returns to education for Cubans

than for

Mexicans or Puerto

Ricans, but not as high as for Whites. Long's major findings were that

about

half of the earnings differentials between Whites and Hispanics could

be attributed to differences in their labor market characteristics, a
finding later confirmed by Gwartney and Long (1978) in their analysis of the
1960 and 1970 U.S. censuses.
Carliner (1980) used data for men from the 1970 U.S. census to
correlate earnings and labor market characteristics for eight ethnic groups,

including Puerto Ricans, Chicanos, and Cubans. Carliner was particularly
interested in the evolution of earnings across first, second, and third

generation Americans. One

of

his key findings was that increases in human

are particularly important in explaining cross-generation increases
in the earnings of Puerto Ricans and Cubans. Among the labor market

capital

characteristics whose connection to earnings he studied, Carliner included a
dummy variable for English mother tongue as a proxy for language skills.

5

(Mother tongue was reported in a version of the public use sample of the
1970 U.S. census that unfortunately did not include another key labor market

variable: year of immigration.) However, he found that the coefficient of
this variable was insignificantly different from zero.
Reimers (1983, 1984) used the Survey of Income and Education to analyze
earnings data for men belonging to five Hispanic groups, as well as for non-

Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks. She found strong evidence of
differential labor market rewards for particular characteristics among
Puerto Ricans, Central and South Americans, and other Hispanics relative to

Whites, but not for Mexicans or Cubans. Although language ability was only
of peripheral interest in her studies, Reimers included a variable for
English-speaking ability in her regression specifications, and found that it

had a negative effect on earnings that was insignificantly different from
zero for all groups except Puerto Ricans.

widened steadily since the l960s. He also showed that the earnings of low-

skill Hispanics fell in the l98Qs relative to those of high-skill Hispanics.

(discussed further below)
Third-Generation

Studies

The third and current generation of studies takes as its central focus
the role of language skills in earnings determination. These studies are
also done in the context of human capital theory, with language itself
6

treated as part of an individual's human capital. In other words, the
studies view the ability to cocmnunicate in the language of the labor market

as an independent contributor to someone's productivity, and therefore to

their earnings. Investigators had recognized the potential importance of
language earlier (for example, Chiswick 1978; Carliner 1980 Reimers 1983,
1984) ,

but

the lack of data limited careful testing of detailed hypotheses

related to language.

The SIE, which was conducted in early 1976, provided the long-awaited
data breakthrough needed for more detailed study of the effects of language

skills on earnings. The SIE included questions about different aspects of
language, some of which referred to an individual's past situation (e.g.,
mother tongue and language used at school), while others referred to
conditions at the time of the survey (e.g., language used at home, language
usually spoken by a person in different situations, and the ability to
understand and speak English).
One of the difficulties researchers who worked with the StE faced was

how to best exploit the large amount of information on language. McManus,
Gould, and Welch (1983) considered all the language variables and defined
seven levels of language proficiency based on the effect of groups of

language variables on earnings. They then used their index in an earnings
equation and found that language proficiency explains a great deal of

earnings variability. However, Chiswick (1991) pointed out a serious
technical

the

problem related to the use of earnings data in the construction of

language proficiency index. This problem likely leads to upwardly

biased estimates of the strength of the language-earnings relationship.

other researchers have used the StE's language questions to define and

test novel new hypotheses. McManus (1985) included a simple indicator based
on proficiency of understanding and speaking English in his earnings model,

7

and found a significant impact on earnings. Grenier (1994) estimated
several specifications of wage equations for Hispanic men that included
various language indicators (e.g., speaking deficiency, language usually

spoken, and childhood language) .

significant effects in his earnings equations, thereby providing evidence
that language proficiency plays a role determining earnings.

Tamer (1988) estimated earnings regressions for foreign-born men. She
used a simple measure of English deficiency and an index that incorporated
English-speaking ability, language used at home, and the language an

individual used most often. She found a significant positive effect of
English language ability on earnings for Hispanics.
Icossoudji (1988) simultaneously modeled earnings and occupational

choices for Hispanic and Asian immigrants, distinguishing between

individuals on the basis of their fluency in English. She found that
immigrants who did not speak English well tended to occupy lower positions
on the occupational ladder.

Some more recent studies have used data sets other than the SIE to

evaluate the effects of language skills on earnings. McManus (1990) used
the 1980 U.S. census to examine the effects of English proficiency within

and outside Hispanic enclaves. He found evidence that Hispanic men with
limited English skills experience less of an earnings shortfall when they
locate themselves in areas with a higher proportion of Hispanics.
Rivera-Batiz (1990) analyzed the 1985 National Assessment of
Educational Progress, which includes a measure of English language
proficiency based on scores from a reading test, in contrast to the self-

assessed measure included in the SIE and most other large databases. He
used a sample of first and second generation immigrants, mostly Spanish-

8

speaking, and found that English reading deficiency was a major factor
limiting immigrants' earnings levels.

In addition, Rivera-Batiz (1991) found that, together with English
reading deficiency, inadequate quantitative skills explain a substantial
portion of the earnings gap between Hispanic and non-Hispanic White young

adults in the United States. He also found that women were more

subsequent work also based on the National Assessment of Educational

Progress, Rivera-Batiz (1992) found that when self-assessed measures of

English proficiency were used to predict wages, the link between the two
variables was weaker than when test-based measures were used. He suggests
that measurement error in self-assessed English proficiency may result in an
understatement of the importance of language skills as a determinant of

market outcomes.

labor

Chiswick (1991) analyzed data from a survey of

male illegal aliens

apprehended in the Los Angeles area in 1986. most of them Hispanics.

Analyzing measures of English speaking and reading ability at the time of
the survey, as well as a measure of speaking ability before coming to the
United States, he found that reading ability affects earnings more than
speaking ability.
Bloom and Grenier (1992a) compared the earnings of Hispanic and non-

Hispanic White men using data from the 1970 and 1980 U.S. censuses. They

found

evidence of a large earnings gap between Spanish- and English-speaking

men in the United States in the l970s. They also found evidence that the
increasing

supply of Spanish speakers in the United States, caused mainly by

rapid immigration, was responsible for a slight deterioration in the
relative wages of Hispanic workers during the 1970s.

Smith (1992) analyzed 1980 U.S. census data for Hispanic men and found

9

that English language ability has a sizeable and significant effect on their

wages. He concluded that English ability explains roughly half of the

differential between Hispanic irmnigrants and native-born Americans.

earnings

In

sum, empirical

economic analyses have established two key results:

(1) that the earnings gap between Hispanics and non-Hispanics is caused
partly by Hispanics having less human capital than non-Hispanics, and partly
by Hispanics having a lower rate of return on their human capital than nonHispanics; and (2) that English language proficiency is an important

component of Hispanics' overall stock of human capital. These results are,
however, generally based on earnings data for men only, with few studies

based on data collected after 1980. The recent release of the public use
samples of the 1990 U.S. census allows us to help fill both gaps in the
literature.

Theoretical Framework

differences may vary

over time in

to differential shifts in labor supply or labor demand. For

example, an increase in the size of a particular language group caused by,
for example, immigration, will tend to increase the group's supply of labor,
and possibly also the demand for its labor, which implies increased
employment levels at an average wage that may be higher or lower depending

on the relative strength of the supply increase (wage-depressing) and the

demand increase (wage-enhancing). This framework does not rule out the
possibility that some workers will e employed in jobs in which their
language proficiency limits their productivity (i.e., jobs in which their
native tongue is not the primary language of communication) .

It also allows

for the possibility that some workers will become bilingual in an attempt to
expand their job opportunities and earning capacity.

Assuming that individuals derive social and cultural

living

benefits from

in communities in which their mother tongue predominates, one might

11

also expect the average wage of a linguistic minority to be relatively lower
in areas in which that community represents a larger share of the overall
population (because lower wages are required to induct individuals to locate
and work in such areas) .

Self-selection

might reinforce this effect insofar

as out-migrants from regions with a high proportion of minority-language
speakers

might place less value on these community characteristics or be

more ambitious and aggressive, and therefore more successful in the labor
market. Our empirical analysis examines these hypotheses through repeated
comparisons of regions with high and low proportions of Hispanics. Although

the nature of our data does not allow us to disentangle the effects of the
multiple

forces possibly influencing earnings differentials between the two

groups, we can measure the net effect and isolate some of its components.

Data and Sample
We analyze the 1/1,000 public use samples of the 1970 and 1980 U.S.
censuses and a 2/1,000 sample from the 1990 U.S. census (drawn from a 1/100

sample tape). Ideally, we would have liked to define linguistic groups on
the basis of mother tongue, but we could not as this information is reported

only

in the 1970 census. As an alternative, we used Hispanic ethnic

origin

as a proxy in all the censuses. In Bloom and Grenier (l992a) we ran some
basic regressions using the 1976 SIE, which contains information on both
ethnic origin and mother tongue, and showed that the results are very
similar no matter which variable is used.

Our analysis

Hispanic
of

focuses on two groups: individuals who reported a

origin (without regard to their origin subgroup, as the definition

these subgroups changed somewhat across censuses), and a control group of

non-Hispanic Whites. A key variable in the analysis is proficiency in
12

English. for which census information is limited, While there is no
information on that characteristic in our 1970 census sample, the 1980 and
1990 censuses include an identical question on English speaking proficiency..

For the purpose of this study, individuals who reported that they can speak

English well or very well are defined as bilingual, while those who reported
that they do not speak English well or that they do not speak it at all are
defined as monolingual.

Our sample includes individuals aged twenty-five to sixty-four. Men
and women are considered separately. For men we also perform a separate
analysis for those aged twenty-five to thirty-four, because we expect their
labor market outcomes to be more sensitive to, and therefore more reflective

of, changing supply and demand influences. By contrast, the employment and
earnings of older workers may reflect decisions and understandings that were
established long ago, for which it is difficult to account.
For the analysis of earnings we include individuals who reported
positive wages and salaries (and no self-employment income) .

These earnings

figures refer to the calendar year preceding the year in which the census

was taken. Thus, the earnings data reported in the 1970. 1980, and 1990
censuses actually correspond to the years 1969, 1979, and 1989. We divide
the United States into regions with high proportions of Hispanics and

regions with low proportions. The distinction is made based on the relative
size of the population of Hispanic origin in states and metropolitan areas

in 1970. Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and the
metropolitan areas of New York State and Florida are areas with a high

proportion of people of Hispanic origin. All other regions of the United
States have a low proportion of people of Hispanic origin. The regions are
divided in the same way in all three censuses.

Some of the earnings comparisons are done with multiple regression

13

analysis, using a standard set of control variables to account for
differences in human capital and other productivity-related characteristics.
.1l three censuses defined these in the same way, although some mild

assumptions occasionally have to be made to permit comparisons. For
instance, information on education is reported in a slightly different way
in the 1990 census than it is in the 1970 and 1980 censuses.
The control variables include education measured in years, education

to allow for nonlinearities, age, age squared, four dummy variables

squared

for weeks worked during the previous year, six dummy variables for hours
worked during the week preceding the census, dummy variables for region of

residence (northeast, north central, south, and west), and dummy variables

for

years since migration for those born outside the United States (one to

five years, five to ten years. and more than ten years).

R.sults
Table 1 reports descriptive statistics on the composition of the

used to make

comparisons. The most striking fact is the

extraordinary increase in the proportion of Hispanics between

1970 and 1990.

For instance, in the heavily Hispanic regions. Hispanic men accounted for 12

percent of male workers in 1970, but 22 percent in 1990. This substantial
change reflects annual growth rates in the number of working age Hispanic

men

that

exceeded $ percent during each intercensal period, more than three

times the rate of increase among the non-Hispanic men. Hispanics also
increased

their relative presence in the labor market in regions with low

proportions of Hispanics, but to a much smaller extent.

14

Table 2 reports earnings comparisons between Hispanic workers and

non-

Hispanic White workers (which is interpreted, based on previous analyses

described earlier, as a comparison between individuals with Spanish as their

mother tongue and those with English as their mother tongue). For the sake
of strict comparability with the multiple regression results reported below,

which

are based on logarithmic earnings equations, earnings differentials

are measured in log points. These are calculated by taking the difference
between groups in the mean of the natural logarithm of their earnings.
These differences are roughly comparable to standard percentage differences

in earnings between the groups, and are not affected by changes in the value
of the U.S. dollar over time.

The results presented in table 2 reveal four noteworthy patterns.
First, Spanish-English earnings differentials are sizeable and are larger
for

men than for women, a finding similar to that reported

by Shapiro and

Stelcner (1987) and Grenier (1988) in their studies of French-English

earnings differentials in Quebec. Among the men, earnings differentials are
slightly smaller for the group aged twenty-five to thirty-four than for the
group aged twenty-five to sixty-four.
Second, Spanish-English earnings differentials are substantially larger
in the heavily Hispanic regions than in the regions with a low proportion of

Hispanics. This result is consistent with the view that labor markets with
larger proportions of minority language speakers value language skills
differently than markets with smaller proportions.

differentials tended to
The increase is particularly

sizeable in the heavily Hispanic regions, especially

during the l980s. The

earnings gap also increased for women in those regions during the 1980s,

after decreasing during the 1970s. For women in the regions with a low
proportion of Hispanics. the earnings gap was stable in the 19705 and
declined in the 19805.

Fourth, earnings differentials are greater for monolingual Spanish

speakers than for bilingual Hispanics. They also appear to have increased
more during the l980s for monolingual Spanish speakers than for bilingual
Hispanics. especially in the heavily Hispanic regions.

To test whether these basic patterns and changes in raw earnings
differentials can be accounted for by the underlying labor market
characteristics of the broadly defined groups under study, we use multiple
regression analysis to re-estimate these differentials

for workers who are

statistically comparable in terms of their marital status, region

of

residence, period of itmaigration. age, and education. We also standardize
the results for differences in weeks worked per year and hours worked per
week, so that the regression results may be interpreted as hourly earnings
differentials.

The results of this analysis are reported in table 3, which shows

that

the pattern of regression-corrected differentials is not at all similar to

that of the raw differentials. First, all the corrected differentials are
smaller than the raw differentials. This change indicates that differences
in education, age, marital status, and other control variables between the

Spanish

and English comparison groups account for much (generally more than

halt) of the differences in their earnings. Indeed.

the estimated

differentials for women are no longer significantly different from

The most important result

in

table 3 is the absence of any widening of

Spanish-English earnings gaps in the 1980s. Given the substantial widening
of the raw earnings differentials apparent in table 2, the

results

in table

3 provide a clear indication that the l900s deterioration of Hispanics'
relative earnings is associated with a deterioration in either the non-

language components of their human capital or in the value assigned to that
human capital in the labor market.

explore this issue further, table 4 reports estimates of the rate of
return to schooling for twenty-five to sixty-four year old men in the 1970,
To

1980, and 1990 U.S. censuses. The estimates declined slightly in both the
high and low proportion Hispanic regions in the l970s, and increased

sharply

both regions in the 1980s. This pattern of results is consistent with
other recent research on changes in the structure of wages in the United
in

States

during the past two

decades (see, for example, Blackburn, Bloom, and

Freeman 1990, 1991, 1993; Katz and Murphy 1992; and Bound and Johnson 1992)
By and large, the estimated differences in the rates of return

insignificant, and show little trend over time. As the Spanish speakers
have less average education than the English speakers, increased wage
premiums associated with educational attainment clearly represented a labor

speakers. thus, an important factor that contributed to the deteriorating

economic position in the aggregate. It also suggests that a large supply of

also account for lower earnings differentials in those regions,

a hypothesis that is supported by the observation that Spanish-English
education gaps are narrower
the

in the low-proportion Hispanic regions than in

heavily Hispanic regions. This hypothesis also derives support from the

fact that the difference in the spanish-English earnings gap between the low
and high proportion Hispanic regions is smaller for women than for men,
presumably because the self-selection phenomenon operates primarily among
18

men. In addition, the stability of the regression-corrected earnings
differentials during the l970s and 1980s, despite the sharp

increases

in the

relative supply of Spanish speakers in the heavily Hispanic regions,

suggests a more important role of demand shifts than

is

indicated by the

simple comparison of ,earnings differentials across regions.

Turning
side,

now from the wage side of the

table S

reports

labor market to the employment

employment-to-population ratios (EPR) • labor force

participation rates CLFP) ,

and

unemployment rates CUR) for selected

demographic groups and regions. These indicators of labor market activity
and success are related, for each subgroup and time period, by the following

identity: Efl =

LFP Il-UR) .

this formula allows us to decompose changes in

employment-to-population ratios into changes in labor forces participation
rates and unemployment rates.

For men, the employment-to-population ratio fell from 1970 to 1990,

though by a larger amount for individuals of Spanish mother tongue than of

English mother tongue. This difference is caused primarily by relatively
larger increases in the unemployment rates of the Spanish speakers than by

differential

changes in their labor force participation rates. Indeed, by

1990 the unemployment rates of Spanish-speaking men were more than twice

those of English-speaking men in

the heavily Hispanic regions.

Spanish-speaking women also have lower employment-to-population ratios

than

English-speaking

women, though these rates increased for both groups

from 1970 to 1990. Unemployment rates for Spanish-speaking women were

19

higher than for

English-speaking women, and increased steadily throughout

the period under study.

Table
adjusted

6 reports gross differentials in unemployment

differentials

rates as well as

that use multiple regression analysis to remove the

influence on unemployment of the following set of characteristics; marital
status, age, region, period of immigration, and education. In other words,
the differentials reported in the second panel of table 6 refer to
individuals

who are statistically comparable in terms of this set of

characteristics.

Table 6 shows that unemployment rate differences between the Spanish
and English speakers are statistically explained by differentials in their
labor market characteristics, especially in 1970 and 1980. Nevertheless,
the portion of excess unemployment among Hispanic men (and women) that could
not be explained by their labor market characteristics was statistically

significant in (1980 and) 1990. The estimates also indicate that labor
market characteristics can account for increases in the relative
unemployment rates

of Spanish speakers in the 1900s (upper panel of table 6)

without reference to mother tongue or

ethnicity.

Suary
This study has analyzed differential labor market outcomes between
Spanish speakers and English speakers residing in the United States.

Consistent with most previous studies' conclusions, the results presented
here show that the earnings of Spanish speakers fall short of those of

20

English speakers, even controlling for cross-group differences in non-

language dimensions of human capital. Language-earnings differentials are
wider among men than among women, and are also quite wide in the more

heavily Hispanic regions of the United States, an indication either that the
return to language skills varies according to the linguistic composition of
local labor and product markets, or that there is considerable self-

selection in the location decisions of Spanish speakers. Earnings
differences between monolingual Spanish and
those between bilingual Spanish and

English

English

speakers are larger than

speakers.

This study also extends previous studies of language-earnings
differentials by analyzing 1990 census data, by focusing on labor market

outcomes

among women as well as among men, and by examining labor market

outcomes on the quantity side of the market (i.e., employment, labor force

participation, and tmemployment) in addition to earnings differentials.
The results reveal rapid growth in the number of Spanish speakers and
slight increases in Spanish-English earnings and unemployment differentials

in the 1910s. By contrast, these differentials increased sharply in the
l980s,

also a period of rapidly increasing supply. However, there is no

evidence that these widening differentials reflect an increase in the labor

market rewards to English language proficiency. Rather, they appear to be
the result of Spanish speakers having relatively little of those labor
market characteristics, most notably education, whose market value increased
dramatically during the 19808.
