JUMPS AND STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY:
EXCHANGE RATE PROCESSES IMPLICIT
IN PHLX DEUTSCHEMARK OPTIONS

ABSTRACT
An efficient method is developed for pricing American options on combination stochastic

volatility/jump-diffusion processes when jump risk and volatility, risk are systematic and
nondiversifiable, thereby nesting two major option pricing models. The parameters implicit in
PHLX-tradcd Deutschemark options of the stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion model and various
submodelsare estimated over 1984-91, and are tested for consistency with the $/DM futures

process and the implicit volatility sample path. The parameters implicit in options are found to
be inconsistent with the time series properties of implicit volatilities, but qualitatively consistent

with log-differenced futures prices. No economically significant implicit expectations of
exchange rate jumps were found in full-sample estimation, which is consistent with the reduced
leptokurtosis of $/DM weekly exchange rate changes over 1984-91 relative to earlier periods.

A considerable amount of evidence has been amassed regarding the conditional and
unconditional moments of exchange rate processes, from time series studies and from option prices.

It is undisputed that volatility is time-varying, as evinced in plots of implicit volatiities over time
and in the extensive literature on ARCH and GARCH models. Time series studies also indicate
that the unconditional distribution of log-differenced exchange rates is leptokurtic, and that there
is an inverse relationship between excess kurtosis and the length of the holding period! Conditional

leptokurtosis has also been found, in time series studies (fat-tailed residuals from ARCH/OARCH
models) and implicit in option prices.' The evidence regarding unconditional and conditional
skewness is more ambiguous, with time series estimates sensitive to the currency and period used.

Studies of option prices have found evidence of substantial positive implicit skewness in options on

foreign currencies during 1983-85, but less evidence during more recent periods.'

'For instance, I-lsieh (1988) estimated unconditional kurtosis of 12.8 for daily changes in the $/DM
exchange rates, while Meese (1986) estimated kurtosis of 4.2 for monthly returns.
'The U-shaped pattern in implicit volatijities across different strike prices documented in Shastri and
Wethyavivorn (1987) and Ben Khelifa (1991) is evidence of a conditionally leptokurtic distribution implicit
in foreign currency options. Model-specific daily estimates of the implicit distribution in Bates (1988a)
found excess kurtosis in options on 1DM futures over 1984-87.
'Bodurtha and Courtadon (1987) document the tendency of an American option version of the BlackScholes model to overprice in- and at-the-money calls and underprice out-of-the-money calls on foreign
currencies during 1983-85, indicating an implicit distribution more positively skewed than the lognormal.
Bates (1988a), using a jump-diffusion model, found substantial positive implicit skewness in options on
Deutschemark futures during 1984-85 but not during 1986 and 1987.

Different time series models have been employed to capture these salient features. Assorted
stationary fat-tailed distributions such as the stable Paretian (Westerfield 1977), Student-t (Rogalski
and Vinso 1978) and jump-diffusions (Akgiray and Booth 1988) have improved on the unconditional

distribution relative to a Gaussian benchmark. Stochastic volatility/ARCH models have been used

to capture the time-varying variances and some -- though not all -- of the leptokurtosis.' More
recent approaches in the time series literature have tended to combine fat-tailed distributions and
time-varying variances; for instance the Student.tJGARCH model of Baillie and Botlerslev (1989)

and the jump-diffusion/ARCH model of Jorion (1989).

Option theory has developed in parallel with the various time series models of exchange
rates. Stochastic volatility models have been used by Melino and Turnbull (1990) and Chesney and

Scott (1989) to price foreign currency options, while Bates (198Sa) and Jorion (1989) have used
Merton's (1976) jump-diffusion model to capture the conditional leptokurtosis. Given substantial

computing costs in pricing options, a standard approach when testing option pricing models has
been to take time series estimates and to examine their implications for the resulting option prices.'

The objective of this study is to proceed in the opposite direction, and to examine the
evidence from option prices regarding the conditional distribution of log-differenced exchange rates.

Given that foreign currency options involve direct bets on the distribution of exchange rate changes.

option prices offer valuable insights into the perceived conditional distribution that are not
necessarily available from time series studies. For instance, implied volatiities from option prices

'Bollerslev, Chou, and Kroner (1992) provide an excellent survey of the ARCH/GARCI-1 literature,
including the applications to foreign exchange rates.

'Examples include Chesney and Scott (1989), Jorion (1989), Melino and Turnbull (1990), and Cao
(1992).

could theoretically summarize all relevant information regarding expected futurevolatilities, whereas

univariate ARCH and GARCH approaches can exploit only the subset of that information

embodied in the past history of asset prices. Equally, option prices should reflect any perceptions
of tow-frequency large-amplitude jump risk, whereas time series studies lack the power in the small
samples typically availabLe to reliably pick up any low-frequency jump component.

Extending the Fourier inversion option pricing methodology of Stein and Stein (1991) and
Heston (1993), a tractable and efficient model for pricingAmerican options on combined stochastic
volatility/jump-diffusion processes in the presence of systematic volatility and jump risk is developed

in Section

1.

The model

and

various submodels are then fitted to transactions datafor

Deutschemark currency options traded on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. in Section II.

The paper also develops Fourier inversion techniques for evaluating the likelihood of
observed sample paths given specific implicit parameter estimates. Using these, the consistency of
the distributions implicit in option prices with the time series properties of implicit volatilities and

the $/DM futures price is tested in Section II. Given an internally consistent stochastic
volatility/jump-diffusion model, it is possible to examine rigorously some of the option pricing

anomalies discovered by others using an ad hoc Black-Scholes model. For instance: whether the

term structure of implicit volatiities is consistent with the time series properties of implicit
volatilities (Stein 1991), and whether implicit volatilities are unbiased predictors of future volatility.

Joint estimation and likelihood ratio tests are used, in contrast to the two-stage estimation approach

of previous studies.

Furthermore, a careful distinction is drawn between the 'risk-neutral"

distributions implicit in option prices and the actual distributions relevant for time series analysis.
Section IJI concludes.

I. A proposed stochastic volatllity/jump-dilfusion model

The following assumptions will be maintained throughout this paper:

Al) Markets are frictionless: there are no transactions costs or differential taxes, trading can
take place continuously, there are no restrictions on borrowing or selling short.

A2) The instantaneous risk-free interest rate r and domestic/foreign interest differential
1, = r - rs are known and constant.

AS) The exchange rate S ($/DM) follows a geometric jump-diffusion with the instantaneous
conditional variance V, following a mean-reverting square root process:

i is the instantaneous rate of appreciation of the foreign currency;
X is the annual frequency of jumps;

k is the random percentage jump conditional on a jump occurring; and
dq is a Poisson counter with intensity X.

The above process for volatility has been used for pricing options under two polar
assumptions about interest rate processes. Bailey and Stuiz (1989) and Bossaerts and Hillion (1993)

price stock index and stock options using the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1984) general equilibrium

production economy, which implies instantaneous conditional variances and interest rates are
proportional and follow the square root process above. On the other hand, Hull and White (1988)
and Heston (1993) price options off the above stochastic volatility process under the more tractable
assumption of constant interest rates. Since Scott (1993) shows that interest rate volatility has little

impact on short-term option prices such as those examined in this study, the latter assumption of
constant domestic and foreign interest rates will be maintained in this study.

used by Hull and White (1987) and Scott (1987), and which is the continuous-time limit of Nelson's

(1990) EGARCH model. There are two major differences, however. First, the instantaneous
variance conditional on no jumps under the former specification can hit a reflecting barrier of zero
if 2a c a, whereas under (2) it can never reach zero (although it can get arbitrarily close). Second,

the volatility of variance increases at a lower power of variance under (1) than under (2). Whether

these differences are empirically important is an open issue.

The major advantages to the former specification for the variance process are twofold. First,
the model can allow [or systematic volatility risk, whereas Hull and White (1987) had to impose the

assumption of nonsystematic volatility risk to generate a tractable option pricing model. The issue

is that if the true process is given by (1), then in a representative agent production econom? the
'risk-neutral" processes used in pricing options that incorporate the appropriate compensation for
jump risk and volatility risk are given by

stage, and implies that the volatility risk premium 'I', = f(V) depends only on V, ln(l+k) is
normally distributed with the same variance 62 as the actual jumps, and X and k

are constant.9

A no-arbitrage constraint on the functional form of the volatility risk premium 'L,(V) is that

marginal utility offoreign-currency denominated wealth J, when computing 1, X and k. An Ito's lemmabased transformation of variables of the process (3) using z — S4 is not correct.

volattlity/jumpdiffusion process with constant parameters is also required here.

White's (1987) assumption of nonsystematic volatility risk (4, — 0) for analytic tractability. In the
case of the square root volatility process, however, the volatility risk premium can plausibly be
modelled as proportional to the conditional variance V1

Note, however, that the steady-state level (a/$) towards which variance tends to revert implicit in

volatility risk premium.

The second major advantage to the square root process for variance is that the process

generates an analytically tractable method of pricing options without sacrificing accuracy or

'°See Ingersoll (1987, Chapter 18) for a discussion of a similar issue with regard to the term structure
of interest rates.

"Strict linearity of the volatility risk premium can be supported under log utility when exchange rate
volatility and market risk have a common component of a particular form. The linear specification will not
typically emerge under more general preferences (e.g., time-separable power utility) and should be viewed
for such preferences as an approximation to the true functional form. Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1984) use
a similar approximation when modelling the risk premium on interest rates.

requiring undesirable restrictions (such asp =0) on parameter values." European options that can
be exercised only at maturity are priced as the expected value of their terminal payoffs under the
"risk-neutral" probability measure:

P = J; (S/E"(Sa] p"(S) dS is also a probability (since the integrand is
nonnegative, and the integral over [0,oo) is one).

For instance, the Garman-Kohlhagen version of the Black-Scholes formula for foreign currency
options under the assumption of constant-volatility geometric Brownian motion for the exchange

root stochastic volatility process that is quite accurate for small (and plausible) values of a,. A jumpdiffusion extension of this approximation was developed and used as an independent check on the option
pricing formulas given below.
'lie foreign-currency options traded on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange trade up through the
Friday preceding the third Wednesday of the contract month -- that Wednesday being the delivery
date for the underlying currency. Given the delay between the last trading day and the delivery day,
the correct Black-Scholes formula for PJ-ILX European calls is
8

The European option evaluation problem is to evaluate P, and P, under the distributional
assumptions embedded in the risk-neutral probability measure. The difficulty is that the cumulative

distribution function for most distributions is messy and, in many cases, we do not have any idea
of what it looks like. Even the Black-Scholes model has a distribution related to the error function,

which is nontrivial to evaluate. When it comes to stochastic volatility models, the distribution
function is unknown. The difficulty in evaluating P1 and P2 is responsible for a bias towards series

solutions for pricing options."

Heston (1993) pointed out that it is much easier to solve for the moment generating
functions associated with P1 and P2. Essentially, one can view the moment generating function as

a contingent claim to be solved using the standard contingent claims' partial differential equation

under relatively easy boundary conditions; details are in Appendix I. (The P's also solve the
equation -- subject, however, to discontinuous boundary conditions that preclude easy solutions.)
Once one has the moment generating function, there exist fast numerical procedures for evaluating
F, and P2. The resulting moment generating functions of ln(Sr/So) for the two probabilities P1 and
P2 when exchange rates follow a combination stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion process are given

a truncated domain was found to be accurate to iO times the spot exchange rate (4 orders of
magnitude less than the minimum price change), except for extreme and implausible jump
parameters.'6 Since pricing call and put options of a common maturity require the same values
of F(it) regardless of the strike price/spot price ratio, enormous efficiency gains can be realized
by evaluating such all options simultaneously."

since the PHLX options on foreign currency are

A similar approximation exists for the put early-exercise premium.

Strictly speaking, the approximation for the early-exercise premium was derived for constant-

volatility jump-diffusions. A comparison with option prices computed via finite-difference methods

revealed a maximal approximation error of around 0.01 e/DM for 6-month in-the-money put
options. The approximation error is substantially smaller for shorter-maturity put options and for
puts with different strike prices, and is negligible for call options of all maturities considered (given

U.S. interest rates substantially higher than German rates over most of the data sample). Given

that the data set considered below consists predominantly of short-maturity out-of-the-money
options and contains relatively few in-the-money puts, the approximation error in the early-exercise

premium was not felt to be of major concerm

II. EstImation
A. Data

Transactions data for Deutschemark foreign currency options were obtained for January

1984 to June 1991 from the Philadelphia Stock Exchange." Prior to September 26, 1987, only
options maturing in March, June, September or December were traded, with contract specifications
geared to the corresponding 1MM foreign currency futures contracts in size (62,500 Deutschemarks,

half the size of the 1MM futures contracts) and maturity (third Wednesday of the contract month).

Trading in contracts maturing the nearest other two months began on September 27, 1987. The

options are American, and could be exercised at any time up to and including the Saturday
preceding the third Wednesday of the contract month.

Roughly 1% of the records mildly violated early-exercise constraints, presumably due to
measurement error in matching up the underlying futures price. Since discarding these data would
bias upward average in-the-money option prices, influencing the implicit parameter estimation, these

data were retained. There was also no attempt to weed out thinly traded option contracts, apart
from the fact that those contracts by their nature received a low weighting in the regressions. A
few obviously erroneous data (01% of the total data) were discarded.

Only a subset of the full data set was used in this study. First, only trades on Wednesdays
were considered, yielding a weekly frequency panel data set. Daily sampling would place extreme

demands on computer memory and time, and would involve issues of modelling day-of-the-week
volatility effects that I do not wish to explore at this time. Second, only morning trades (9-12 EST)

"Data were also available for options on British pounds, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen and
Swiss francs, and will be examined at a later stage. Options on French francs, though also available,
are too thinly traded to merit scrutiny.

were considered --

a

tradeoff between shortening the interval for greater synchronicity, and

lengthening it to get more observations19 Third, only options with March/June/September/
December maturities and with 6 months or less to maturity were used -- for a maximum of two
option maturities per day. The resulting data set consists of 19,689 transactions (11,952 calls; 7,737

puts) on 372 Wednesday mornings over January 4, 1984 - June 19, 1991; an average of 53 trades

per morning. Not

all Wednesdays are included, owing

to

data

collection problems at the

Philadelphia Stock Exchange during February 1985, November 1985, and September 1988.

Other data needed in pricing foreign currency options include the underlying asset price, a

risk-free discount rate, and the domestic/foreign interest rate differential. Transactions prices for
1MM foreign currency futures were obtained from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the

nearest preceding futures price of comparable or shorter maturity was used as the underlying asset

price -- provided the lapsed time was less than 5 minutes. Otherwise, the option record was
discarded. The futures data were of higher quality than the Telerate time-stamped spot exchange

rate quotes provided by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, which were occasionally egregiously

wrong. Daily 3-month Treasury bill yields were used for the risk-free discount rate. The daily
domestic/foreign interest rate differential was inferred from synchronously recorded spot rates and
1- and 3-month forward rates, using covered interest parity and adjusting for weekend and end-of-

month effects on the maturity of the forward contract.

'°50% of the daily trades over 1984-1991 took place between 9 and 12. The greatest activity was
between 9 and 10:30, when U.S. and European markets were open simultaneously.

'Another oddity of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange data base is that prior to September 28,
1984, every record appears twice. The duplicate data were discarded.

B. Unconstrained Implicit Parameter Estimation
Implicit parameters were initially estimated via nonlinear equal-weighted least squares on the

panel data set of call and put prices for all observed strike prices and (quarterly cycle) maturities

an implicit spot from a synchronous futures transaction;

Note that the average Wednesday morning realizations of the instantaneous variance { } must also

be estimated. Intradaily movements in instantaneous variance were ignored in the estimation
procedure.

Two points should be made regarding the above regression. First, the usual time series
objection to estimating the set of instantaneous variance realizations (VJ and thereby having an
additional free parameter for each new day does not arise when options are used. In essence, the

daily realization of V is observable from option prices, whereas it is not under time series
estimation.

Second, the restriction that the process {} actually be drawn from its postulated
distribution -- in particular, that volatility follow a diffusion -- has not been imposed at this stage.
Non-zero parameter estimates are being generated cross-sectionally off the observed moneyness and

maturity biases of the option prices relative to the benchmark Black-Scholes model, and not off the

time series properties of {VJ. The regression is in essence a "method of moments" estimator in
which transformations of the moments -- the option prices -- are observed with almost no noise.

17

The separate case in which V, estimates are constrained by the postulated diffusion will be examined
below.

Parameters were estimated using 000PT quadratic hill-climbing software, methods
GRADX and DFP, with multiple starting values. First and second derivatives of the loss function

were computed numerically, coded to eliminate irrelevant computations.21 Estimates of implicit
parameters on the full data set took between 8 hours and 3 days on a dedicated Hewlett-Packard
Apollo 720 workstation, depending upon which model was used.

For full sample estimation over 1984-91, allowing for stochastic volatility and for jumps
reduced standard errors only by about 0.006% of the spot rate relative to the adhoc Black-Scholes

procedure of estimating a different implicit volatility for every day in the sample (see Table 1).

With an average exchange rate around 50 /DM over the sample, this represents a reduction in
standard errors of about 0.003 e/DM -- less than

price tick. Over half of this improvement was

attributable to relaxing the daily constraint of a flat term structure of volatilities, and instead
allowing for a monotonically decreasing or increasing term structure (depending on whether V1

cx/$) under the deterministic volatility model. Reduction of remaining moneyness and maturity
biases using the stochastic volatility and stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion models reduced standard

errors by a further 1/10 of a price tick. Allowing for jumps created a statistically but not
economically siiificant increase in the model's ability to match option prices relative to the
stochastic volatility model.

Estimates of implicit parameters for two-year subsamples revealed substantial and
statistically significant subsample instability. Root mean squared error for the stochastic volatility
and stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion models fell 0.06% of the spot price (¾ price tick) relative

to the full-sample parameters, ending up 0.012% (½ price tick) below the ad hoc "Black-Scholes"
estimates. Three-quarters of the improvement relative to Black-Scholes was again attributable to

a better modelling of the term structure of implicit volatilities. The stochastic volatility model's
ability to explain residual moneyness and maturity biases was of secondary importance, reducing
standard errors only by a further ¼ price tick. The combined stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion
model had a substantially identical performance in subsamples to the stochastic volatility model.
Allowing for jumps increased explanatory power during the strong-dollar early years of the sample
-- particularly 1984-85.

Full-sample estimation of the general model yields a high-frequency low-amplitude jump

component that is observationally equivalent to geometric Brownian motion?2 In effect, a
geometric Brownian motion/stochastic volatility process is being estimated. The instantaneous
variance process consists of a constant plus a mean-reverting component:

Var(dS/S) =

where V_ =

Xt {

(ln(l+P) -

+

V1

52), the variance attributable to jumps, was estimated at

(6.6%)2 per year. The mean-reverting component V1 under the SVJD model had generally plausible

parameters: a steady-state level of (13.4%)2 per year, a hall-life to volatility shocks of 7.5 months.

The estimated mean reversion reflected the tendency of the term structure of implicit volatilities
to be upward sloping for low short-term volatilities, and to be inverted for high values. Parameters

9nspection of the moment generating function (9) for small values of 6 reveals the equivalence
of low-amplitude jumps and geometric Brownian motion, except at intradaily frequencies.
19

for the stochastic volatility model were comparable. The estimated instantaneous conditional

variances were indistinguishable for both models (Figure 1). However, the sample path for
Var(dS/S) estimated under the SVJD model involved a reflection off the minimum value of
whereas the path estimated under the SV model never approached the reflecting barrier at V1 = 0.

Full-sample parameter estimates from the SVJD model indicate a distribution slightly more

positively skewed than the lognormal distribution underlying the Black-Scholes and deterministic

volatility option pricing models (Figure 2), at all but extremely short horizons. Implicit skewness
did not appear to be stable over time, however, with positive implicit skewness in the first half of
the sample relative to the lognormal distribution, and predominantly negative implicit skewness in

the second half. A substantial volatility of variance implied moderate leptokurtosis at longer

horizons relative to the lognornal distribution. The excess kurtosis is present in all biannual
subsamples. No evidence of substantial excess kurtosis for daily or weekly holding horizons was

found, contrary to the evidence from time series studies cited in Bollerslev, Chou, and Kroner
(1992). Instead, the profile of kurtosis across maturities was almost entirely driven by the stochastic

volatility process, with a direct rather than inverse relationship evident.

Decomposition of the residuals of the stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion model estimated

over 1984-1991 in Table Ill reveals that the model tended to overprice out-of-the-money call and

put options of all maturities and underprice in-the-money put options of all maturities. At first
glance, it appears surprising that the pricing errors for calls and puts of comparable strike prices

should diverge in sign, given that put-call parity (for the European portion of the option prices)
implies that the pricing errors should be comparable in sign and magnitude. Further scrutiny of the

residuals reveals that the divergent moneyness biases for calls versus puts was attributable to the
parameter instability noted above, combined with the fact that calls were relatively heavily traded
20

in the first half of the 1984-9 1 period while puts were more heavily traded in the second half.

C. Consistency with the time series properties of implicit volatilities

As noted by Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1984), the transition density of y =

conditional

(1- e)/fl and fi is the actual

on 1', is noncentral chi-suared x2(4a/a, 2cV,e"), where c —

rate of mean reversion of the volatility process (as distinct from the risk-adjusted parameter

implicit in option prices):

4cr/at, A 2cIe', and I'() is the gamma function. However, the non-central clii-

squared density function has infinite value at 2cV,44, = 0 when the reflecting barrier is attainable

(Vip c 1). yielding nonsensical results when the sample path {VJ is among the parameters to be
estimated.

Consequently, the applications below use the transition density of the monotonic

transformation ln(V,,,), which has finite density everywhere:

p( lnV"" I V ) —

(23)

where & =

Maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters {a, fi, a,} estimated from the time series

of implicit instantaneous conditional volatilities {V,} diverge substantially from the parameters {a,

fl, a} estimated cross-sectionally from option prices, as is shown in Table IV. In particular, the
volatility of variance a implicit in option prices is substantially higher than the supposedly identical

parameter estimated off the time series properties of {VL}. The parameters a and fi affecting the
21

drift are estimated with less precision; nevertheless, there is a significant deviation in estimated a's.

Given measurement error in option prices, however, the above two-step estimation
procedure does not constitute a formal test of the hypothesis of identical {a, } parameters for
option prices and time series. Under the assumptions that the cross-sectional measurement error

in option prices is homoskedastic Gaussian white nois&' and is independent of volatility
realizations, the appropriate loss function for testing hypotheses is

errors in option prices from equation (21),

= E, lnp(ln(2cV,) a, fi, c;V,) is the log-likelihood of an estimated {V,} sample path
given p() from equation (23).

The joint hypothesis of identical {a, a,} parameters for options and time series was tested
using a likelihood ratio test:

Unconstrained parameter estimates: c (V,}, X, t, .5, a, fl, a,,
Constrained parameter estimates:

<

(a,

fi. a,},, .._

>

X,P, 6, a, a. a, ,, p}o,,&n.&umn.nt. >

t'The assumption that measurement error is homoskedastic regardless of strike price, maturity,
and whether the option is a call or a put is clearly a strong and implausible assumption. However,
the parameter estimates are consistent under the null hypothesis of correct model specification.
Increasing efficiency by adjusting for heteroskedastic measurement error would just increase the
already substantial weight given to options prices relative to time series observations, and is unlikely
to change the conclusions below. Serial correlation in measurement errors is a more relevant
concern — and more difficult to resolve given the varying maturity structure of the options data.
22

Table V reports the results of unconstrained versus constrained estimation for the stochastic

volatility (SV) and stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion (SVJD) models. Constraining the volatility

process brought the volatility of variance parameter a more in line with the time series behavior
of {V,}, and smoothed somewhat the estimated sample path of {V,}.

In fact, constrained estimation

actually increas&! the joint log-likelihood of the SVJD model, given that the estimated unconstrained
V,}

sample path was highly implausible. Nevertheless, both the SV and SVJD models are internally

inconsistent.

The constraint of identical {u, a} parameters in the options and resulting {1} time

series data for the SV model is strongly rejected, based on two criteria:
1) the worsening of the joint log-likelihood (110,308 versus 110,369 -- P-value

C

2) the inconsistency of the constrained {V,}
implicit parameters {a, o} and the constrained

sample path { V,} (log-likelihood 97 versus 158 -- P-value <
The

11116).

latter criterion also yields rejection of the SVJD model, at a P-value less than l0. A

comparison of the constrained SV and SVJD models indicates that the hypothesis of no jumps
cannot be rejected.

The rejections are predominantly attributable to inconsistencies in the volatility of variance

parameter r The implausibiLity of the high c implicit in option prices is particularly evident when
one compares the unconditional gamma distribution of {V,} implicit in the SV parameter estimates

with the sample distribution of {1} (Figure 4). A high volatility of variance implies frequent
reflections off zero and substantial clustering of implicit instantaneous variances near 0, contrary

to what is observed. The SVJD model erroneously predicts an even greater degree of clustering
near zero.

Previous studies have argued that the term structure of implicit volatilities is inconsistent
with the time series properties of implicit volatilities .- in particular, that the term structure is too
23

flat given observed mean reversion of implicit volatiities?4 In this model, the term structure of

implicit expected average variances for 0-3 month versus 3-6 month options depends upon the

parameters a and :
V(T)

- w(flV0 + [1 -w(fl)J-5—, w(T) • 1_•P

E [0,1)
(24)

Since

the expected average variance is roughly the implicit variance from the Black-Scholes

mode1,' the issue is equivalent to the issue of whether the <a, fl> parameters implicit in option

prices are consistent with the <a, fi> parameters derived from the AR(l) time series properties
of implicit variances.

The two sets of parameters do in fact diverge in unconstrained parameter estimation.

However, the parameters can in principle diverge because of a volatility risk premium.
Furthermore, the standard errors suggest that the divergence is predominantly attributable to
diverging a's rather than to diverging a's. In fact one cannot reject the no volatility risk premium
hypothesis H0: fl =

at standard significance levels for either the SV or the SVJD model when

the a's (and a,'s) are constrained to be identical. Consequehtly, it is the mean variance level a/fl
implicit in option prices (ecuivalently, the level of long-maturity implicit variances) that is primarily

incompatible with the time series properties of impticit variances, rather than the rate oi mean
reversion towards that average level.

"Stein (1989) makes this argument with regard to implicit volatiities from S&P 100 options,
while Campa and Chang (1993) make a similar point with regard to interbank foreign currency
options.

'51n principle, there are Jensen's inequality biases relevant to the choice of implicit volatilities
versus implicit variances and to the choice of the moneyness of the options used in computing
implicit volatilities. These biases do not appear empirically important.
24

E. Consistency with the time series properties of futures prices
A further test of the stochastic volatility and stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion models is
their consistency or inconsistency with observed realizations of exchange rates and foreign currency

futures prices. To examine this, the actual (as opposed to "risk-neutral) futures price process was
parameterized as follows:

dPIF -

-

[c0 + c1(r,—r') +

Cov(dZ. dZ,,)
Frob(dq — 1)

- pdi
Adt, ln(1+k) — N(In(l+k)—½62,

—

62).

The inclusion of interest differentials in the instantaneous conditional mean nests two alternative

hypotheses: that the futures price follows a martingale (c0 =

= = 0) and that the underlying

spot exchange rate follows a martingate (c0 = ç = 0, c1 = -1). The inclusion of the instantaneous

variance allows for instantaneous "GARCH-in-mearf-type interactions between volatility and the
futures price, although higher moments are also affected in discrete time. The resulting probability

density of the log-differenced futures price conditional upon instantaneous variance % is

The stochastic volatility parameters {a, c, p}

and

the set of instantaneous variance

realizations {V,} should theoretically be common to both the option prices and the futures price

process. To test for bias in implicit variance forecasts, however, the conditional instantaneous
variance was modelled as a linear transform of the instantaneous variance realization implicit in
option prices:

V, -

cit0

+

cv,V,°"', cv0O

(31)

where the coeFficients cv0 and cv, were estimated. The actual (as opposed to risk-neutral) jump

parameters were also estimated, as were the influences of interest differentials and instantaneous

volatility. Since option prices provide no direct information about the true rate of variance mean
reversion, fi was initially treated as a free parameter to be estimated.

The futures data were short-maturity (0 to 3 months) noon quotes on Wednesdays for which

there were options data available. The typical time interval was therefore one week, although there
were rwe occasions in which missing options data resulted in a longer time interval. Weeks in which

the maturity of the short-maturity futures contract jumped were excluded.
26

Maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters are presented in Table VIA. As has been
found elsewhere, estimates of the conditional mean suggest that it is the spot exchange rate rather

than the futures price that follows a martingale, although neither hypothesis can be rejected in this

single-currency regression?6 No statistically or economically significant jump component was
found. The hypothesis that impLicit volatilities provide no useful information in forecasting future

volatilities was strongly rejected for {V7""} sample paths estimated from both the stochastic

volatility (SV) and stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion (SVJD) models. The hypothesis that the
implicit volatility is a linearly unbiased forecast of future volatility (typically over a one-week holding

period) was rejected at the 10% level but not the 5% level for the SV model, and not at all for the
SVJD model.

The inability to reject unbiasedness in the variance forecasts was in part attributable to the

existence of a free parameter 5

Consequently, the future price process was re-estimated

conditional on the constrained C (Vj, a, fi, a,. p> stochastic volatility parameter estimates from
Table V -- i.e., taking into account the Lane series properties of implicit volatilities. The result

(Table VIB) is borderline rejections of unbiasedness for the SV and SVJD models. With an
average implicit instantaneous variance of (.13)2 from the SV model, the average optimal linear
transform of (.12)2 indicates that implicit instantaneous variances were typically biased upwards

relative to subsequent weekly futures price volatility, but not substantially. The bias in variance

forecasts is most pronounced in the early part of the 1984-91 sample, and appears to decline
somewhat over time.

2LSee Hodrick (1987) and Froot and Thaler (1990) for surveys of the extensive literature on
rejections of uncovered interest parity, which is equivalent to rejection of the hypothesis that the
futures price follows a martingale. The strongest rejections of uncovered interest parity have been
within a multi-currency framework; e.g., Hsieh (1984).
27

Section F. Consistency with the joint futures and volatility processes
The above evidence regarding the futures price process was of course based upon two-stage

estimation, taking the implicit variance and stochastic volatility parameters as given. It is, however,
possible to compute the joins transition density pQn

In

techniques; details are in Appendix TI. Using the associated log-likelihood function

In L1,,1( I F',), A, k, 6, a, j3. a, 8, c0, C1, c,) — , lnp(lnF,, In V, I F,_1,

V) (32)

the hypothesis that the distributions implicit in option prices are consistent with the joint futures
and variance series can be examined using the methodolo' of section TIC. In particular, whether
the implicit correlation p between futures price innovations and variance innovations is consistent
with the time series properties of the two series can be tested.

The parameter estimates in Table VII indicate that futures and implicit volatility innovations
typically have a small negative correlation that is not statistically significant, in contrast to the small

positive correlation implicit in option prices. The hypothesis of consistent processes is again
strongly rejected for the stochastic volatility, given the criteria of unconstrained versus constrained

joint options/time series estimation (log-likelihood of 111,225 versus 111298; P-value C l016) and

the comparison of the constrained (F, V} implicit time series parameters (a, as., p} with the
constrained {F, V} sample path (1010 versus 1077: P-value c 10.16). The latter but not the former

criterion also leads to rejection of the stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion model.

Parameter estimates indicate that the conditional futures and implicit variance processes are

approximately independent:

28

p(ln F,467, In k,6, F,,
I

?) —

p(1iiF461 I F,,

V) p(lnV,8, IF,, V)

(33)

The parameter estimates essentially reflect the variance-constrained estimates of Table IV,
combined with the futures process estimated in Table VIB conditional on those variance-constrained
estimates. Consequently, the inconsistency of the {F, V} parameters implicit in option prices with

the time series properties of the futures and implicit variance processes can again be attributed
primarily to the implicit variance parameters. There is no evidence in support of the existence of
a fat-tailed jump component.

Table VIB also presents stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion parameters estimated under the

additional constraints X =

=

. While in principle the parameters can deviate because of

a jump risk premium, calibrations such as in Bates (1991) suggest that it is implausible that the
parameters should deviate substantially even when jump risk is fully systematic. Again, no evidence

of jumps is found in estimation under these additional constraints.

The absence of a statistically significant jump component in the $/DM futures price and
implicit in the DM option prices over 1984-91 is inconsistent with previous time series studies of

the $/DM exchange rate. Akgiray and Booth (1988) and Jorion (1989) both found statistically
significant jump components, while Bollarslev, Chou and Kroner (1992) cite other studies that have

found fat-tailed residuals in the $/DM exchange rate even after adjusting for ARCH/GARCH
effects. However, Table VIII indicates that the distribution of the $/DM exchange rate has changed.

with less excess kurtosis for weekly returns over 1984-9 1 than was the case over 1974-85.
Consequently, the distributions implicit in DM/$ option prices are in fact qualitatively consistent
with the time series with respect to the lack of abnormalities.

29

III. Conclusions
Overall, the Deutschemark options traded on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange appear
substantially consistent with the time series properties of the underlying exchange rates. Based on

estimation over the full 1984-1991 period, there is no evidence of a leptokurtic jump component

implicit in option prices -- which accords with the absence of such components in weekly futures
price changes over that period. Implicit variances are definitely useful in predicting future volatility

and are not strongly biased on average, although the hypothesis of unbiased forecasts is rejected.

The major discrepancy between 1DM options and time series data is that the implicit

parameters of the variance process are sharply inconsistent with the time series of implicit
variances. The major divergence is in the volatility of variance. This originates in a residual
implicit leptokurtosis directly rather than inversely related to option maturity, and therefore cannot

be explained away by jumps. The mean variance level implicit in option prices has also been too
high relative to the mean of the time series of implicit variances. This latter divergence is primarily

relevant for long-term rather than short-term exchange rate volatility forecasting.

A further concern is that the parameters of the time series process are not stable over time.
In particular, the steady-state variance level implicit in option prices trended downward over 1984-

1991, while implicit skewness changed sign from positive to negative. Of course, the assumption

of stability is driven by econometric necessity rather than a priori reasoning. Nevertheless, the
evidence of parameter instability suggests that option pricing models based solely on more and more

complicated descriptions of the underlying asset price process may ultimately face the same
limitations as their corresponding discrete-time ARCH/GARCFI counterparts. The research
agenda of the future may be to identify those omitted "fundamentals' that are showing up as
parameter shifts in current option pricing models.

Graph shows

1) the instantaneous implicit volatilities fV from the stochastic volatility (SV) model

2) the instantaneous implicit volatilities [V,_, + 'ç]' from the stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion
(SVJD)
model
The two impLicit instantaneous volatiities are indistinguishable.
The steady-state level:

for the SV model,

[V_ + (a/$')] for the SVJD model.
The expected average volatility, which corresponds closely to the Black-Scholes implicit volatility, is
intermediate between the instantaneous and steady-state levels.
