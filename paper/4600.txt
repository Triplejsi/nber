NBER Working Paper #4600
December 1993
THE WEALTH OF COHORTS: RETIREMENT
SAVING AND THE CHANGING ASSETS
OF OLDER AMERICANS

ABSTRACT
Personal retirement accounts are becoming an increasingly important form of retirement

saving. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the paper considers

the effect of this change on the assets of recent retirees and persons who are approaching
retirement. Much of the analysis is based on comparison of younger and older cohorts with
different lengths of exposure to personal retirement saving programs. The findings suggest that
personal retirement saving has already added substantially to the personal fmancial assets of older

families. Projections imply that the personal financial assets of the cohort that will attain age 76

in 28 years will be almost twice as large as the personal financial assets of the cohort that
attained age 76 in 1991. The results indicate also that to date there has been little replacement
of employer-provided pension saving with personal retirement saving. Together with evidence

that personal financial saving is unrelated to changes in home equity, the results suggest that
personal retirement saving will lead to an important increase in the overall wealth of the elderly.

Americans are changing the way they save for retirement.
Contributions to personal saving accounts are becoming an increasingly

large proportion of retirement saving while contributions to traditional
employer-provided pension plans are declining. The proportion of total

contributions accounted for by IRAs, 401(k), and Keogh plans
increased from about 7 to over 50 percent during the 1980s. We
consider the effect that this change has had on the assets of recent

retirees and on persons on the eve of retirement. We find that
contributions to personal plans have already added appreciably to the
personal retirement assets of older Americans and, by implication, that

the effect is likely to be much larger in the future.
The paper emphasizes the changing assets of older Americans.

The change has been fueled by the rising popularity of personal
retirement saving and thus to evaluate its implications for the financial

status of the elderly it is necessary to understand the saving effect of
these programs. In a series of earlier papers we considered the saving
effects of IRAs.' Venti and Wise [1992] introduced analysis based on

comparison of "like families,"

a version of the cohort analysis

structure used in this paper. Poterba, Venti, and Wise [1992, 1993a]
considered the saving effect of 401(k) and IRA contributions based in

part on the comparison of like families and in part on the "quasi
experiment" presented by eligibility for 401(k) plans. This paper
contributes to that line of analysis, but with a different focus, a

1Results using different data sets and different methodologies are presented

in Venti and Wise [1986, 1987, 1990b, 1992]. The findings of other
investigators of this issue—Gale and Scholz [1990], Feenberg and Skinner
[1989], and Joines and Manegold [1991]—are summarized in the last paper.

different methodology, and a broader scope. We direct attention to
families just before and just after retirement. We frame the analysis

explicitly in terms of cohorts. The analysis rests primaxily on
comparison of older and younger cohorts of respondents to the Survey

of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) between 1984 and 1991.
The cohorts had different lengths ofexposure to the personal retirement

saving plans introduced in the 1980s. Persons who were already
retired in the early 1980s had less opportunity to contribute than
persons who were still working when these plans were introduced.

We consider not only whether personal retirement saving
contributions substitute for other personal fmancial assets, as in our
previous papers, but also whether they substitute for employer-provided

pension assets. To understand the effect of pensions on saving, we
need to understand not only how personal retirement saving is related
to other personal financial assets, but also how each of these is related
to employer-provided pension assets.

Traditional economic assumptions imply that if employers
increase saving for employees through employer-provided pension
entitlements then employees will save less. Or, if individuals choose

to save more through personal retirement saving plans then they will

save less in other personal financial assets. Or, if individual housing
equity is increased through unanticipated gains in housing prices, then
the individual will reduce saving in other forms. The net saving effect
of personal retirement saving depends on whether individuals make
economic financial decisions in accordance with these assumptions. We

-2-

find that for the most part these assumptions are inconsistent with
observed individual behavior.

I.

BACKGROUND.

A.

Data.

The analysis is based primarily on 1984, 1987, and 1991 data

from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The

data are drawn from the 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1990 panels of the
survey, with data for the same year sometimes available from more
than one panel. The 1984 interview was conducted between September
and December 1984 and the 1987 interview between January and April

1987, with approximately 28 months between the two interview
periods. Thus in the cohort analysis described below we treat this

interval as a two-year period. The 1987 and 1991 surveys were
conducted almost exactly four years apart. The 1984 to 1991 period
is assumed to span six years.

Each panel contains eight interview waves administered every
four months over a 32 month period. We use all the waves containing
supplemental topical modules requesting detailed information on assets

and liabilities and pension plan coverage. These waves are wave 4 of
the 1984 panel (administered between September and December 1984),

wave 7 of the 1985 panel and wave 4 of the 1986 panel (January to
April 1987), and wave 4 of the 1990 panel (February to May 1991).

The SIPP household is defined by a physical address. These were

reformatted into individual family units headed by either a
husband-wife pair or a single individual. Thus a single SIPP household

may yield several "families" for the present analysis.

-3-

We consider the following asset categories:

• Personal Financial Assets

• Total

• Personal (Targeted) Retirement Assets
• Other Personal Financial Assets
• Employer-Provided Pension Assets
• Social Security Assets

• Home Equity
• Other Non-Liquid Equity

The analysis deals primarily with personal financial assets and
employer-provided pension assets. The components of each of the
categories are listed in Appendix Table 1. The table pertains to
families aged 65 to 69 in 1991. It reports the proportion of families
owning each of the components, as well as the asset mean and median

values. The category "personal retirement assets" includes holdings in

IRAs, 401(k)s, Keoghs, and life insurance annuities.2 But the mean
(and median) family balance would have been quite small at that time.
These saving plans are grouped together because each narrowly targets

saving for retirement, as opposed to saving for other, presumably more

short-term, goals. The category "other personal financial assets"
encompasses conventional (non-tax advantaged) saving vehicles,
including saving accounts, money market depositaccounts, CDs, NOW

accounts, money market funds, U.S. government securities, municipal

and corporate bonds, stocks, mutual funds, U.S. Savings Bonds, and

other interest earning assets. The category "total personal financial
assets" is the sum of personal retirement assets and other personal

Respondents were not asked for a 401(k) balance for 1984.

financial assets. Home equity is the current market value of the home
less the unpaid mortgage.

As explained below, the data are used to create means and
medians by cohort—all persons who are the same age in a particular
calendar year. Thus the same cohort can be followed over successive

ages in 1984, 1987, and 1991.

However, Social Security and

employer-provided pension assets must be calculated from observed

benefit payments. Thus wealth in these forms is available only for

persons who are retired and we typically consider them only for
persons over 65. The present values are obtained by capitalizing the
stream of monthly income from each source using sex-specific survival

probabilities calculated from mortality tables.3

B.

Family Wealth at Retirement.

Social Security benefits provide the vast majority of the income

of a large fraction of retired Americans, and the present value of
expected future benefits is the major component of the wealth of most
elderly families. In 1991, the median Social Security wealth of families

with heads 65 to 69 was about $100,000. (See Figure la.) Median

3A discount rate of 6 percent is used.

Social Security, Railroad
Retirement, federal employee, and military pensions are indexed by law.
About 75 percent of state and local public employees receive some post
retirement benefit increase; about half receive automatic COLAs (Phillips
(1992). Post-retirement benefit increases in the private, sector are less
common. Gustman and Steinmeier (1993) found that during the 17 year
period ending in 1987, that included a period of high inflation, about 45
percent of private sector defined benefit plans provided some post-retirement

cost of living increase, usually ad hoc. We have indexed Social Security,
Military pension, Railroad retirement, and all government employee pension
annuities at an annual rate of 4 percent. Other annuities are not indexed.

-5-

employer-provided pension wealth (including government and military
pensions) was only $16,017. Pension wealth is distributed much more

unevenly than Social Security wealth—44 percent of families 65 to 69

have no pension income at all. The median level ofhousing equity was

$50,000, but housing equity is typically not used to support
consumption of the elderly, at least not until quite advanced ages.4 The

median level of other non-liquid assets, such as cars and business

equity was only $5,992.

Personal saving through conventional

channels represents a very small proportion of the assets of most older

families; the median level of (other) personal financial assets was only

$7,428. Thus most families, if they spend the income provided by
Social Security and employer pension annuities, have almost no liquid
accessible assets to meet unexpected expenditures. More than half of
families had neither IRA nor 401(k) accounts so that the median wealth

in personal retirement assets was zero.
Although the median is the best single measure of the assets of
the typical family, the components of wealth other than Social Security
are highly skewed so that the means are much larger than the medians.
The mean level of other personal financial assets in 1991 was $42,018,

more than five times the median. But even mean other personal

4See Venti and Wise [1989,

1990a,

1991], Feinstein and McFadden

[1989], and Sheiner and Weil [1992].
5The value for 1991 may be an anomaly. Medians in earlier years were
about $9,000 and mean values increased from about $34,365 in 1984 to
$42,018 in 1991.

financial assets are a small fraction of combined Social Security and
employer-provided pension assets, as indicated in Figure lb.
The means, however, reveal the increasing importance of IRA

and 401(k) assets as a fraction of total personal financial assets. For
families aged 65 to 69, personal retirement assets were only 6.6 percent

of total personal financial assets in 1984, they represented 20.6 percent

by 1991. Personal retirement assets increased over four fold between

1984 and 1991, much more than any other component of wealth, as
shown in Figure ic.

C.

Aggregate IRA and 401(k) Saving.

Total contributions to IRA and 401(k) accounts over the l980s
are shown in Figure 2. IRA contributions jumped enormously in 1982
as soon as they became available to all wage earners and then increased

to a peak of over $38 billion in 1985.

Contributions dropped

dramatically after the Tax Reform Act of 1986, that limited the taxdeductibility of the contributions of families with incomes over $40,000

per year and single persons with incomes over $25,000. Even though

only 27 percent of contributors were affected by the legislation,6
contributions fell by over 60 percent, with a dramatic decline even in

the contributions of persons who were unaffected by the legislation.

The implications of this decline are discussed in detail in Poterba,
Venti, and Wise [1992, 1993a]. By 1990, less than $10 billion was
contributed to IRA accounts.

Contributions to 401(k) plans increased consistently from their

introduction in 1982 to $46.1 billion in 1989, the most recent date for

which data are available. Straight line extrapolation of past trends
would suggest that contributions are now about 70 billion. Figure 2
reveals no relationship between IRA and 401(k) contributions, with the
annual increase in 401(k) contributions about the same after as before
the 1987 decline in IRA contributions.
The relationship between these contributions and contributions

to other retirement saving plans (excluding Social Security) is shown

in Figure 3a. Contributions to defined benefit pension plans declined
almost 40 percent, from $48.4 billion in 1980 to $24.9 billion in 1989.

This decline was apparently due primarily to the large unexpected
returns to pension fund assets over the 1980s, as described in Bernheim

and Shoven [1988]. The decline may have been induced also in part
by the funding limits imposed by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1987, as explained in Schieber and Shoven [1993]. Participants

in defined benefit plans declined only 9.3 percent and the number of

plans by 10.5 percent between 1980 and 1989.

Contributions to

defined contribution plans remained about the same over the entire
period.7

Personal targeted retirement saving represented only 7.6
percent of the total in 1980 but had increased to over 50 percent of the

total by 1989. It seems apparent that if IRA contributions had not been

curtailed by the 1986 legislation, balances in these accounts would have

represented a much larger fraction of contributions to all retirement
plans and total contributions would have been substantially larger. The

trend in total contributions displayed in Figure 3a closely follows the
trend in IRA contributions.

Total personal saving as measured by the Federal Reserve
Board's Flow of Funds (FOF) accounts, is shown in Figure 3b. These
data include contributions to targeted retirement saving plans, as well

as other components of saving. The FOF data are based on direct

measurement of the net acquisition of assets and are thus more
comparable to the targeted retirement saving components than the
National Income and Product Account (NIPA) data, the most often
cited measure of aggregate personal saving. The NIPA data estimate

saving as the residual between disposable income and personal
consumption expenditures. The FOF data include several assets not
incorporated in the NIPA defmition of saving.8 Thus, in addition to

the more inclusive FOF series, the Federal Reserve Board also
publishes a series that attempts to match the components of saving that

are in principle included in the NIPA measure—indicated by "FOF
NIPA Basis" in Figure 3b. But even after the adjustment, the NIPA
and FOF measures often differ by tens of billions of dollars. They are
discussed in some detail in Poterba, Venti, and Wise [1993b].

8There are three principle conceptual differences between the FOF and the
NIPA definitions of savings. These involve treatment of non-housing durable

goods, state and local government pension reserves, and net saving of
corporate farms. For details see Wilson et al [1989].

-9-

Targeted retirement contributions represent a large fraction of

FOP national saving.

In 1986, for example, retirement plan

contributions accounted for 72.3 percent of FOF NIPA Basis data and

30.9 percent of the unadjusted FOP series. Both measures tend to
follow the pattern of targeted retirement saving in Figure 3a, which in

turn follows the pattern of IRA contributions. In particular, both
measures show a substantial increase in saving between 1980 and 1986,
both show a noticeable fall in saving after the 1986 legislation, and then

a recovery by 1989.

The goal of the subsequent analysis is to assess the impact of

personal retirement saving on the financial status of older Americans

as they approach and enter retirement. Two issues are considered.
First, using cohort data, the relationship between personal retirement
saving and other personal financial assets is considered in this section

2. Second, the relationship between total personal financial assets and
employer-provided pension assets is considered in section 3. We direct

attention only briefly to the relationship between housing wealth and

personal financial assets, but that relationship has been analyzed
recently by Hoynes and McFadden [1993]. who find little relationship
between changes in housing equity and personal fmancial assets. We
rely on their results in making summary judgements about the net effect

of personal targeted retirement saving on the financial assets of older

Americans. In his review article on the relationship between housing
equity and wealth, Skinner [1991] also concludes that there is littleor
no relationship between housing equity and other financial asset saving.

II.

PERSONAL RETIREMENT SAVING AND OThER
ASSETS: COHORT ANALYSIS.
A.

Cohorts and Cohort Data.

We begin with a discussion of the principle elements of cohort

analysis. A cohort is typically a group of persons that are born in the

same year. Thus persons who are a given age in 1984 are also a
cohort. Cohort analysis usually means that the same cohort is followed

over time. That is, persons who are age 50 in 1984 can be observed
in 1985, 1986, and so forth. Panel data is designed to follow specific
individuals over time. For example, the mean wealth of persons who

are 50 in 1984 can be traced over time, considering the mean wealth

of these same persons in 1985, in 1986, and so forth. From panel
data, the cohort means are obtained directly by following the same

persons over time. But cohort means can also be obtained from
random samples of the population in successive years (a series of cross-

sections). We use the SIPP data in this way, although these data also

include a short panel component, following the same people for 32

months. Using these data, the mean assets of a random sample of
persons who are 50 in 1984 are compared to the mean assets of another

random sample of persons who are 51 in 1985, 52 in 1986, and so on.

We have made calculations for 15 cohorts defined by age in

1984: C42, C44, ... , C70. For ease of exposition we usually show
data graphically for only a subset of the cohorts. In fact, each cohort

is defined by all persons within a 5-year age interval in 1984. For
example, C42 refers to the midpoint of the interval that includes people

between 40 and 44 in 1984, 41 and 45 in 1985, etc.

—11—

For illustration, mean personal retirement saving assets are
graphed for five cohorts in Figure 4a. For each cohort, assets are
reported for 1984, 1987, and 1991. For example, the mean of personaJ

retirement assets of cohort C46 was about $1,800 in 1984, $4,500 in
1986, and $11,700 by 1991. Increases for the C52 and C58 cohorts

are also large. But the increases for the older cohorts are much
smaller. The C70 cohort, that was past typical retirement age in the
early 1980s when the programs were introduced, accumulated very
little in personal retirement assets. That is, the relationship between
age and the accumulation of personal retirement assets depends strongly

on the cohort.
Notice that the relationship between age and asset accumulation

judged by the cross-section profile is grossly misleading in this case.
For example, the difference between the assets of 46 and 52 year olds

in 1984 is much less than the assets actually accumulated by cohort
C46 between age 46 (in 1984) and age 52 (in 1991). In Figure 4athe
cross-section relationship between age and assets can be obtained by

linking the values reported for a given year. For example, 1991 values

are reported for ages 52, 58, 64, 70, and 76, highlighted by the small
circles. Similarly, the 1984 values—for ages 46, 52, 58, 64, and

70—are highlighted by the triangles. In both cases the cross-section

relationship gives a distorted view of the actual accumulation of
personal retirement assets with age. This is because the large "cohort
effects" are unrecognized in the cross-section relationship.
The cohort effects can be judged directly by the difference in
assets of cohorts that attained a given age in different calendar years.

-12-

At a given age, different cohorts had different lengths of exposure to

personal retirement saving programs, that were widely available
beginning in 1982. For example, cohort C46 that attained age 52 in
1991 accumulated much greater personal retirement assets by age 52
than cohort C52 that attained age 52 in 1984 and thus, by that age, had

had many fewer years to accumulate these assets. The same is true for

cohorts C52 and C58 at age 58, C58 and C64 at age 64, and C64 and

C70 at age 70.
To facilitate exposition, we often fit the three data points for
each cohort and graph the fitted values, as shown in Figure 4b. In this
way it is possible to visualize many more cohorts on the same graph.

Mean personal retirement assets for all 15 cohorts are shown
in Appendix Table 2. The data for each cohort is in a separate column
and the relationship between age and assets within a cohort is shown by

the asset values moving down the column. Cross-section relationships

for 1984 are shown in the "top" diagonal, for 1987 by the middle
diagonal, and for 1991 by the lower diagonal. As indicated in Figure
4, the differences are extremely large.

In the subsequent analysis we will consider whether cohort
effects like those shown for personal retirement assets in Figure 4 are

offset by countervailing cohort effects with respect to other personal

financial assets. If they are, there will be no cohort effects in total
personal financial assets; it they are not, the personal retirement asset

cohort effects will be mirrored by similar cohort effects in total
personal financial assets. Equivalently, if there are no cohort effects

with respect to other personal financial assets, this implies that the

-13-

personal retirement asset cohort effects are not cancelled by offsetting

cohort effects in other personal financial assets. To highlight the
cohort effects, most of the evidence is presented graphically. We also

use more formal estimates of cohort effects to project the future
retirement assets of younger cohorts.

B.

Personal Retirement Assets and Other Personal
Financial Assets

We begin by considering the assets of all respondents to the
SIPP. The basic assumption is that younger cohorts—that reached a

given age in later calendar years—had a longer period in which to
contribute to personal retirement accounts. But that in other respects
the cohorts are similar (after correcting for earnings). Thus differences
in asset accumulation can be attributed to the differential availability of

these programs. The implicit assumption is that the differences are not

due to a systematic trend in the "taste" for saving. Contributors to
personal targeted retirement saving programs and non-contributors are

then considered separately. In this case, the cohort differences among
contributors are assumed to result from the differences in exposure to

the special retirement saving programs. In addition, however, the
cohort effects of contributors can be compared to the cohort effects
among non-contributors. The non-contributor cohort effects might be
considered an indication of cohort effects that would have obtained in
the absence of the special retirement saving programs. The results will

show that for the most part there are no cohort effects among noncontributors. For contributors, cohort effects are observed with respect

-14-

to personal retirement assets but not with respect to other personal
financial assets.
To simplify the graphical exposition, we sometimes show the

actual data for "non-overlapping cohorts," as in Figure 4a. Or, we

present fitted values like those in Figure 4b. We would like to
emphasize the assets of the typical family and thus would prefer to use

median values. In addition, the medians are less subject to random
fluctuation due to extreme outliers. As explained above, however, in
some instances the medians are not informative (when fewer than 50
percent of families own an asset) and we present only means.

An issue that arises in the cohort analysis is the appropriate

comparison of the assets of persons who attained a given age in
different calendar years. If our goal were to compare the purchasing
power of different cohorts, a price index would be the most appropriate

measure by which to put different calendar year data on a common
basis. Here, however, the issue is not purchasing power but rather the

saving that would have occurred in the absence of the personal
retirement saving programs. There are at least two possibilities: One
is to assume that the increase (or decrease) in other personal financial

asset saving that would have occurred in the absence of the personal
retirement saving programs is the percent increase in this asset category

among non-contributors. Averaged over ages 48 to 68 the increase was

3.8 percent between 1984 and 1991. Another conceptual approach is
to base the correction on the nominal earnings of successive cohorts,
assuming that other personal financial asset saving is based on earnings,

and, that there would have been no real cohort effects in personal

-15-

financial asset saving in the absence of the personal retirement saving
programs.

The closest empirical

approximation to this
conceptualization may be an earnings index. For illustration, we
present some results in nominal dollars, but most of the results are
based on values converted to 1984 dollars using the wage and salary
component of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index.

All Respondents: Means.

a.

Nominal Values.

The mean personal targeted retirement assets of cohorts C46,
C52, C58, C64, and C70 are shown in Figure 5a. As described with
respect to the, illustrative figure above, younger cohorts, that attained

any specific age in a later calendar year and thus at that age had had
longer exposure to the special retirement saving plans introduced in the

early l980s—accumulated much larger personal retirement assets. For

example, cohort C58 accumulated the highest level of personal
retirement assets. Members of this cohort were age 56 when the IRA
and 401(k) programs were expanded in 1982 and were age 64 when last

surveyed in 1991. The C70 cohort accumulated the lowest level of
personal retirement assets. Members of this cohort were already age
68 and past retirement in 1982 and thus were in large part unable to
take advantage of the IRA and 401(k) programs.
The corresponding means of other personal financial assets of

the same cohorts are shown in Figure Sb. The accumulation of
personal retirement assets—described above—differed greatly by cohort,

the corresponding accumulation of other personal financial assets also

shows a cohort effect, but not one that offsets the retirement asset

-16-

cohort effect; younger cohorts also have higher levels of other financial
assets.

Because the rapid accumulation of retirement assets was not

offset by a reduction in the accumulation of other financial assets, the
accumulation of total personal financial assets also shows strong cohort

effect, with younger cohorts—who attained any age in a later
year—typically accumulating more personal financial assets, as shown

in Figure 5c. Both total and retirement assets for three cohort are

shown in Figure Sd. At age 58, for example, the difference in
retirement assets of cohorts 52 and 58 can be compared directly to the

difference in the total personal assets of these cohorts. The same
comparison can be made for cohorts 58 and 64 at age 64.

b.

Indexed Values—Fitted.

Fitted values of total and retirement assets for eight cohorts are

shown in Figure 5e. The vertical lines are to aid in comparing the
cohort differences in total and retirement assets at given ages. If there
were no reduction in the other financial assets of successive cohorts as

they increased their personal retirement assets, the difference in the
total would be equal to the difference in retirement assets. The average

of the ratios of the total to the retirement asset difference is 1.16.

There is of course some randomness in these ratios. But the data
suggest that the accumulation of personal retirement assets resulted for

the most part in a corresponding increase in total personal financial
assets. Fitted values for other personal financial assets are graphed in
Figure Sf. They reveal essentially no systematic cohort effect.

-17-

c.

Indexed Values—Actual And Projected.

The results above show that each of the successively younger
cohorts has greater personal financial assets than the preceding older
cohort. What will be the personal financial asset levels of the younger

cohorts when they reach the age of the oldest cohort? Although it is
improbable that future asset levels can be precisely predicted, we
believe that the data allow plausible projections of the future assets of

the younger cohorts. We fit the actual cohort means with a
specification of the form
Ak=c +P+y1(Agej)+y2(Age,)2+y3(Age,)3+eft

(1)

where A represents an asset category—personal retirement assets, other

personal financial assets, total personal financial assets—c indexes

cohort and i the ith cohort mean. The fl are cohort effects with
= 0. Thus the individual estimates represent deviations from the
mean effect, which is set to zero. The specification is intended to fit
the age-asset accumulation pattern, allowing the differences in the
levels of the assets between successive cohorts to be maintained as the

cohorts age, and to cumulate. It is assumed, for example, that the
estimated difference between the assets of the two youngest cohorts,

C42 and C46, will be maintained as the cohorts age. Thus the
projected difference at age 76 in the asset levels of cohorts C42 and
C70, for example, is given by the difference between C42 and C44,
plus the difference between C44 and C46, plus the difference between

C46 and C48, and so forth. Indeed, it is convenient to think of the
estimated cohort effects as representing the projected cohort differences

-18-

at age 76. It is likely that this assumption implies a conservative
estimate of the projected cohort differences.

differences as the cohorts age, for example, imply much larger age 76
cohort differences.

The estimates are shown in Table la. The projected personal
retirement assets (column 1) of the youngest cohort are $14,076 above

the mean while the projected assets of the oldest cohort are $13,105

below the mean, a difference of $27,181.

If there were no

counterbalancing cohort effects with respect to other personal financial

assets, the total personal financial asset cohort effects should
approximately parallel the retirement asset cohort effects.

The

estimates show that the projected total (column 2) for the youngest
cohort is $16,003 above the mean and $14,083 below the mean for the

oldest cohort, a difference of $30,086. The other personal financial
asset cohort effects are typically not statistically different from zero.
An F-test does not reject the hypothesis that there are no cohort effects,

that is, that all the individual effects are zero.

The projections of total personal financial assets based on
equation (1) are graphed in Figure 5g. The age 76 personal financial
assets of the oldest cohort are $37,299; the projected age 76 assets of
the youngest cohort are $67,385, an increase of over 80 percent.

Contributors and Non-Contributors Separately:
Indexed Means.

a.

Indexed Values—Fitted.

Because only a minority of respondents contribute to a personal

retirement saving account—only about 40 percent of cohorts who were

younger than 65 in 1984 and a much smaller percent of older
-19-

cohorts—the total saving effect of the participants is diluted by the

larger number of respondents that did not participate and were
apparently unaffected by these saving programs. Thus we also present

data for contributors and non-contributors separately. The findings
based on means are shown in Figures 6a through 6c. Again, cohorts

who reached a given age in a later calendar year, had accumulated
much more in personal retirement accounts than cohorts who reached

that age in an earlier year. These differences are reflected, for the
most part, in corresponding differences in total personal financial
assets, as shown in Figure 6a. And, as with both contributors and noncontributors together, the cohort data for other personal financial assets

of contributors show essentially no systematic cohort effects. (See
Figure 6b.)
For comparison, the accumulation of personal financial assets

of non-contributors is shown in Figure 6c. There appear to be no
cohort effects among non-contributors at younger ages. At older ages,

older cohorts appear to have slightly higher personal financial asset
levels. This may be because a smaller proportion of older cohorts ever
contributed to a personal retirement plan, and thus the non-contributors
among the older cohorts disproportionately include "savers" that if they
were younger would have contributed to a personal retirement account.

This composition effect is discussed below with reference to Table 2.

b.

Indexed Values—Actual and Projected.

Projected means (indexed to 1984) of contributors are shown

in Figure 6d together with actual values for selected cohorts. The
projected age 76 total personal financial assets of cohort C70 (in 1991)

-20-

is $93,151; the projected value of the C42 cohort at age 76—18 years
hence—is $160,175. As with both contributors and non-contributors,

the estimated cohort effects for total personal financial assets tend to
mirror the estimated effects for personal retirement assets, as shown in

Table lb. The estimated cohort effects for other personal financial
assets are not typically statistically different from zero. (The estimates,

however, reveal an apparent composition effect among older cohorts

and this is discussed below.) Thus for participating families the
cumulative effect of personal retirement account contributions is very

large. Assuming no cohort effect with respect to other personal
financial assets, personal retirement assets would increase over the next

18 years from 22 to 50 percent of the total personal financial assets of
age 76 families.

3.

Contributors and Non-Contributors Separately:
Indexed Medians.

a.

Indexed Values—Fitted.

As mentioned above, the distribution of financial assets is
highly skewed so that means are much larger than medians. Thus the

median is a much better indicator of the assets of the typical family.
Medians for all respondents are not informative, however, because the

median for personal targeted retirement assets is typically zero.
Median total and retirement assets for contributors are shown in Figure

7a. Like the means, the medians also show that younger cohorts
accumulated much larger levels of personal retirement assets than older

cohorts. The larger accumulation of retirement assets was not offset by

a corresponding reduction in the accumulation of other personal
financial assets (Figure 7b), that show no substantial off-setting cohort

-21-

effects. Thus younger contributor cohorts are accumulating much

larger levels of total financial assets (Figure 7a) than their older
counterparts.

The medians for non—contributors are shown in Figure 7c.
These data show extremely low levels of financial assets and essentially

no cohort effects at younger ages. As mentioned above, the "apparent"

cohort effect for the oldest cohort apparently reflects a composition
effect; most of the oldest respondents were non-contributors, and thus
had greater assets than younger cohort non-contributors.

b.

Indexed Values—Actual and Projected.

Like the means, the projected median values of total personal

financial assets show very large cohort effects that tend to mirror the

cohort effects for personal retirement assets, as shown in Table ic.
Recall that unlike means the sum of the medians if not the median of
the sum, and thus the estimated cohort effects cannot be "added" across

equations. Most of the estimated cohort effects for other personal
financial assets are not statistically different from zero, although an
apparent composition effect is reflected in the estimated cohort effects

among older cohorts. Nonetheless, it is clear that younger cohorts of
participating families are accumulating much more in total personal

financial assets than older cohorts. The projected median of current

age 76 families (cohort C70 in 1991) is $62,388; the projected
accumulation of the youngest cohort by age 76 is $107,138.
4.

Summary of Age-Specific Cohort Effects: Medians.

The graphs of the cohort data show the accumulation of assets

with age for successively older cohorts. The different levels of asset

-22-

accumulation by different cohorts at specific ages provide the core data

to evaluate the net saving effect of personal retirement saving
contributions. The median data are summarized in Table 2. These
data are based on the same cohort data graphed in Figures 7a through
7c. But not all of the cohort data in the table are shown in the figures.

Consider the age 60-64 data, for example. Median targeted
retirement saving increased from $6,477 for the oldest cohort (those

who were in this age interval in 1984) to $22,131 for the youngest

cohort (who were in this age interval in 1991). There was little
corresponding change in other personal financial assets by cohort,

however, from $17,617 for the oldest cohort to $20,100 for the
youngest cohort. Total personal fmancial assets increased by almost 90

percent, from $27,101 to $52,498. The table shows the assets of non-

contributors as well. They show no trend and are extremely small,
$600 in 1991. Similar trends are revealed for the other age groups.
In addition, the table shows the proportion of each age group

that has a personal retirement saving account. The proportion with
retirement accounts does not vary much by age or cohort for persons

younger than 64. Nor does the proportion vary much for the oldest
age group, of which very few in any cohort had accounts. But older
cohorts, in the 65 to 69 and 70 to 74 age intervals in particular, were
much less likely than the younger cohorts to have personal retirement
accounts. Thus the data show a decrease in the total personal financial
assets of non-contributors in the 65 to 69 age interval as the proportion

in the non-contributor status declined (from .81 to .65).

This

composition effect is also reflected in the older cohort data graphed in

-23-

Figures 6c and 7c and the data must be interpreted accordingly. But
the data for "pre-retirement" ages and for the oldest ages seem not to
be importantly affected by this changing composition.
ifi. PERSONAL RETIREMENT SAVING AND EMPLOYERPROVII)ED PENSION ASSETS.

Tradeoffs between personal retirement saving and other
personal financial asset saving may provide the most readily available

opportunity for substitution from one form of saving to the other. But
personal retirement saving could also substitute for employer provided

pension assets.

Persons who foresee larger employer-provided

retirement benefits may be less likely to contribute to a 401(k) plan, or

to an IRA account, or to accumulate other personal financial assets.
Thus we consider whether families with more pension wealth have less
wealth in total personal financial assets.

There are two circumstances that condition the analysis: first,

the SIPP data do not allow calculation of employer-provided pension

wealth until a person is retired and receiving pension benefits. The
benefit, together with life tables, can be used to determine the present
value of expected future pension benefits—pension wealth. Thus cohort

analysis as presented above is not suitable in this case. Second, both
pension wealth and personal fmancial asset saving will increase with

income, thus without controlling for income persons with greater
personal financial wealth would almost certainly have greater pension

wealth as well. Thus we consider the relationship between personal
financial assets and pension wealth for persons 65 to 69, who have

-24-

retired and for whom we can determine pension wealth.9 And we use
Social Security wealth percentiles to control for lifetime income. The
relationship between Social Security wealth and lifetime income is very

non-linear, with less than proportionate increases in Social Security
wealth as lifetime income increases. But we believe that the percentile
level provides the best available means of grouping people by lifetime
income.

Using an analysis of variance framework, we estimate the
relationship between pension wealth and three personal financial asset

categories: personal retirement assets, other personal financial assets,

and total personal fmancial assets. The specification is of the form
(2)
A1 = a1 + b1(PensionWealth) + c1(Education) + e,
where i indicates the ith Social Security wealth decile and A denote a
personal financial asset category.

The parameter estimates on pension wealth are reported in
Table 3 for each of the personal asset categories and for each of the

years 1984, 1987, and 1991. The estimates are typically small but
suggest that a dollar more in pension wealth is associated with from 4

cents less to 19 cents more in total personal financial assets in 1991,

although most estimates are not statistically different from zero.
Essentially the same results are obtained if education is excluded from

the specification. And, the same results are obtained if home equity is

added to the specification, to control for other wealth that could in

9Only persons th reported Social Security benefits are included in the
analysis.

-25-

principle be used to meet financial needs after retirement. Thus we

conclude that there is unlikely to be much if any substitution of
personal financial saving for employer-provided pension entitlement.

We obtain essentially the same results when equation (1) is
estimated separately for persons with and without a college degree. If

anything, the results are stronger for persons with college degrees.
That is, the estimated coefficients are somewhat larger for the college

educated group. This result is apparently at variance with the recent
results of Bernheim and Scholz [1993], who find no substitution for
persons without a college degree but a positive substitution effect for
persons with a college degree. Their estimates are based on the Survey

of Consumer Finances and pertain to persons who are not yet retired.

They use an indicator variable for pension coverage, whereas we use
pension wealth just after retirement. Their measure of personal assets

includes business equity and property other than primary home,
whereas we include only personal financial assets. Our ANOVA
specification also aims to capture lifetime earnings differences and
allows for complete interaction by Social Security wealth percentile.

Several other previous studies have considered the impact of

employer-provided pensions on personal saving. The early work of
Cagan [1965] and Katona [1965] found that persons covered by an
employer pension save more in other forms. Cagan attributed this to
a "recognition effect," whereby pension coverage induces awareness of

the need to save for the future. More recently, several studies have
sought to update and add to this line of analysis by relating personal
saving to expected pension wealth, instead of pension coverage. These

-26-

studies have focused on older persons who are not yet retired and for

whom the pension-saving tradeoff may be greatest. The results have
been mixed, perhaps because it is difficult to calculate pension wealth

accurately for persons who are not yet retired. Munnell [1976] finds

a substantial offset, as high as 62 cents for each dollar of estimated
pension wealth. Blinder, Gordon, and Wise [1981], Hubbard [1985],
and Avery, Alliehausen, and Gustafson [1986], however, find little or
no evidence of a tradeoff; Diamond and Hausman [1984] find a modest

tradeoff. Thus these findings would suggest that the tradeoff is far
from dollar fOr dollar and the consensus view appears to be little or no

effect.
Possibly the principle reservation about the previous studies is

the difficulty of constructing an accurate measure of expected pension

wealth for persons prior to receipt of pension benefits.

Such

calculations require assumptions about job mobility, future earnings,
time to retirement, and, most important, pension plan provisions. The
detail necessary to calculate pension wealth is are not reported in any

of the data used by previous investigators, with the exception of the

Survey of Consumer Finances used by Avery, Eli iehausen, and
Gustafson [1986]. Thus we have directed attention to recently retired
persons and have used Social Security wealth percentiles to control for
lifetime income.

IV.

HOUSING EQUITY.
Rapid increases in housing prices led to large increases in home

equity in many parts of the country over the 1980s. The cohort
data—not indexed—are shown in Figure 8. The substantial cohort

-27-

effect is apparent. Younger cohorts that attained a given age in a later
year typically had accumulated more housing equity. Thus not only did

younger cohorts accumulate more wealth in personal retirement saving

plans, they also accumulated more wealth in the form of housing. For

many, the increase in housing equity was probably an unanticipated

windfall gain. Thus it might be expected that there would be even

more inducement to reduce other personal financial asset saving,
contrary to the findings reported above.
Notice that the figure shows increasing housing equity for every

cohort through age 76. Cross-section data, however, would show a
misleading decline in housing equity with age. The 1991 cross-section

data, represented by the 1991 values at 52, 58, 64, 70, and 76, show

home equity declining after age 64. Older cohorts have less housing

equity than younger cohorts, but not because they reduce housing
equity as they age.

We have not attempted in this paper to consider formally the
relationship between personal financial asset saving and housing equity.

Hoynes and McFadden [1993] have recently completed an analysis of

this issue. They find essentially no relationship between increases in

home equity and total personal financial asset saving, based on data
from the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID). They are able to
follow the same persons over an extended time period. The SIPP data
follow the same persons for only 30 months and the cohort method we

use in section two does not provide a sufficient number of cohorts to

perform a meaningful comparison of changes in home equity versus
changes in personal financial assets by cohort. Skinner [1991], based

-28-

on a survey of analysis of this issue, also finds little relationship
between housing equity and personal financial assets.
V.
CONCLUSIONS.

Personal targeted retirement accounts are an increasingly
important form of saving for retirement. By 1989, contributions to
IRA, 401(k), and Keogh accounts exceeded contributions to traditional

employer-provided defmed benefit and defined contribution pension

plans. We have emphasized the effect of this form of saving on the

financial status of recent retirees and on persons approaching
retirement. Based on comparison of younger and older cohorts, we

conclude that, for the most part, the increasing contributions to
personal retirement plans have not displaced other fmancial asset
saving. And thus that the real personal financial assets of younger
cohorts are substantially larger than the assets of their predecessors.
Although any projections must be imprecise, the conservative estimates

that we have made suggest that age 76 families 18 years in the future

will have almost $25,000 more in a personal financial assets than

current 76 year old families—about $67,000 versus $43,000. The
personal financial assets of participating families will be $67,000 higher

at age 76—$93,000 versus $160,000.
Using Social Security wealth percentiles to control for lifetime

income, we find that thus far there has been little replacement of
employer-provided pension entitlements with personal retirement
saving. Nor do we find any reduction in other personal financial asset
saving with increases in employer-provided pension wealth. Thus we

conclude that, for the most part, personal retirement saving has not

-29-

displaced saving by employers on the part of individuals, nor have
employer pensions displaced other personal financial assets. This
should not be interpreted to mean that employer pensions have no effect

on individual behavior.

It seems apparent that employer pensions
together with Social Security have led to dramatic declines in typical
retirement ages and the labor force participation of older Americans.
Thus even if pensions have not reduced the amount that employees save

in other forms, they surely have reduced the amount that older persons

earn. This issue is discussed in some detail in Lumsdaine and Wise
[1990].

Because we can find no apparent offset to the increase in
personal retirement saving, we believe that this form of saving will not

only be an increasingly important component of the wealth of the
elderly, but indeed holds the prospect of adding substantially to the
financial status of older Americans. In particular, personal retirement

saving is likely to increase substantially the non-annuitized liquid
financial saving of older families.

If these trends continue, the baby boom generation will
accumulate substantially larger levels of personal financial assets than
there older counterparts and thus after retirement will have much larger

pools of accessible assets upon which to draw to meet unexpected
contingencies.
