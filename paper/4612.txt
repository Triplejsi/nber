CITIES AND GROWI'H: THEORY AND
EVIDENCE FROM FRANCE AND JAPAN

ABSTRACT
The relative distribution of the populations of the top 40 urban areas of France and Japan

remained very constant during these countries' periods of industrialization and urbanization.
Moreover, projection of their future distributions based on past growth indicates that their size-

distributions in steady state will not differ essentially from what they have been historically.
Urbanization consequently appears to have taken the form of the parallel growth of cities, rather

than of convergence to an optimal city size or of the divergent growth of the largest cities. We

develop a model of urbanization and growth based on the accumulation of human capital
consistent with these observations. Our model predicts that larger Cities will have higher levels

of human capital, higher rents, and higher wages per worker, even though workers are
homogeneous and free to migrate between cities. Cities grow at a common growth rate, with
relative city size depending upon the environment that they provide for learning.

I. INTRODUCTION

A basic aspect of economic development is the movement of population from
the countryside to cities.1 In this paper we consider the particular cases of
France between 1876 and 1990 and Japan between 1925 and 1985, both of which
experienced substantially increased urbanization during these periods of
industrialization. 2
We

consider the further issue of whether urbanization took the form of:

(1) an increase in the population of larger cities relative to other cities
("divergent growth"), (2) the growth of smaller cities relative to larger
cities ("convergent growth"), or (3) similar growth rates across cities of

different sizes ("parallel growth"). We find that the evidence rejects the
first hypotheses: Urbanization took the form of similar growth rates across
cities of different sizes (with only slightly faster growth of large cities in

tKuznets' (1966) historical data document the increased share of population
living in urban areas during the economic development of a number of rich
nations. Chenery and Syrquin's (1980)-cross—sectional evidence shows that the
share of a nation's population that lives in cities rises with its per capita
GNP.

2Between 1876 and 1990 the population of France grew from 36.9 million to 55.8
million, while the agglomeration of Paris grew from 2.6 million to 9.3
million. Between 1925 and 1985 Japan grew from 59.7 to 122.6 million people,
while metropolitan Tokyo grew from 6.5 million to 26.5 million. Hence we are
considering each country for a period in which the total population roughly
doubled, while the population of the largest urban areas (as well as the other
urban areas in our sample) approximately quadrupled.

Japan).
We

then develop a model of growth and urbanization consistent with this

finding. We adopt a model of urban development in which urban growth is
driven by the acquisition of human capital.3 We choose this approach because
of the emphasis that a number of observers of urban development have placed on

the role of human capital in the functioning of cities.4 Lucas (1988), in
particular, specifically relates what his model identifies as the driving
process of economic growth, the acquisition of knowledge and the externalities
associated with it, to the forces that lead to the development of cities:

It seems to me that the 'force' we need to postulate to account
for the central role of cities in economic life is of exactly the
sane character as the 'external human capital' I have postulated
as a force to account for certain features of aggregate development.
(1988, pp. 38—39)

Nevertheless, this literature has so far not provided any formal link between
the processes of economic growth and of urbanization.

Going back at least to Adam Smith, analysts have thought about economic

growth in terms of nations. This focus may partly reflect the availability of
data at that level. But nation states typically correspond to single legal
jurisdictions and, as posited by Ricardo, may best correspond to the domain of

3Work on the determinants of economic growth has attempted to explain the
secular growth of per capita GNP in terms of (i) physical capital investment
(Solow, 1956, Romer, 1986), (ii) the accumulation of human capital (Uzawa,
1965, Lucas, 1988), (iii) product and process innovation (Inada, 1969,
Grossman and Helpman, 1991), and (iv) learning by doing (Arrow, 1962, Young,
1991).

4See, for example, the discussions in Jacobs (1969, 1984), Henderson (1988),
Rauch (1991), and Glaiser, et al. (1992). Much of the urban literature has
focused on the development of cities that specialize in the production of
particular commodities (as in Henderson, 1988). Our approach, in contrast,
focuses on cities that need not be specialized, whose productivity derives
from the interaction of individuals with complementary forms of knowledge.

—3—

factor markets. For these reasons this choice of unit may be totally
reasonable. Nevertheless, it remains an open question whether the driving
forces of economic growth are primarily national in character, with the growth
of cities following as a derivative, or whether the process of economic
development can better be understood by focusing on some smaller unit, such as

the city. The model we develop in this paper allows us to distinguish between
local and national sources of growth.

Our purpose here is to review some issues raised by the role of
urbanization in economic growth, to examine some evidence, and to provide a
simple analytic framework to relate the process of urbanization to economic

growth. We do so by integrating two branches of literature, that on the
endogenous determinants of economic growth, in particular the Lucas (1988)
model of human capital accumulation, and that on circular cities, developed by
Hills (1967), Arnott (1979), Helpman and

Pines

(1980), and Henderson (1987,

1988), among others.
In Section II which follows we consider the basic empirical question of
the extent to which the process of urbanization associated with development is
primarily extensive, taking the form of the creation of new cities, or

intensive, involving the growth of existing cities. Existing work on
urbanization and growth (e.g., Niyao, 1987, Henderson, 1987), predicts that
urbanization takes the form of the creation of new cities, whose size

converges to an optimum city size.5 Hére we develop an alternative approach
in which urbanization involves the parallel expansion of a given number of
cities.

5Henderson's (1987) analysis relates new cities to new industries. The
steady—state implication is that "the economy grows by churning out new cities
at the rate of population growth." (p. 950). Glaiser et al. (1992), on the
other hand, find that diversified cities tend to grow faster.

-4-

The question is analogous to the issue of "convergence" in economic

growth. The hypothesis that urbanization is primarily extensive implies that
city sizes should "converge," i.e., initially smaller cities should grow

faster than larger cities. Our alternative model implies "parallel growth,"
that is, population growth rates that are independent of initial size, with
growth raie3 converging to a common value.
We examine this issue with data from 39 French urban areas
(agglomerations) from 1876 to 1990 and for 40 Japanese urban areas for the

period 1925 to 1985. The French data provide striking evidence in favor of
parallel growth: The size distribution of cities remains virtually unchanged
throughout the period. Moreover, we find little evidence either of "new" or
of "dying" cities. Results for Japan also suggest evidence of parallel growth
with some slight, statistically insignificant, additional concentration in

large cities. In neither country do we find any support for the convergence

or divergence hypothesis.
We then develop, in Sections III, IV and V, a model of urbanization and
growth consistent with the parallel steady—state growth of cities, but with
possibly different short—term growth rates and changes in the ranking of
individual cities.

Section III presents a static model of a city. Land is a factor of
production, and total productivity within a city declines with the distance of

6The notion that relative city size does not change even as urban populations
grow relative to the population as a whole has an old tradition in the
regional science literature. In particular, the "rank—order rule" asserts
that the product of a city's population and its rank in population is constant
across cities and time. Beckmann (1958), Rodwin (1970), and Henderson (1988)
discuss the rule and its history. With the exception of the analysis in
Henderson (1988), which concerns the growth of specialized cities, the rule
does not appear to have played a role in current theories of urban growth.
The rule does not appear to be mentioned, for example, in the Iandbook of
legionat and Urban Economics (1987).

—5—

production from the city center. This last assumption is meant to capture in
a simple way the contribution of urban agglomeration and

proximity

to

productivity.

In Section IV we make the model dynamic. We relate total factor

productivity in a city to its average level of human capital, as in Lucas

(1988). A basic characteristic of a city is the environment that it provides
for acquiring human capital (which can either be city—specific or general in

terms of its applicability). Cities are linked together in terms of how their
human capital stocks contribute to learning, much as the human capital stocks
of different countries jointly contribute to national pools of knowledge in

Lucas (1993). The interaction of the human capital stocks of different cities
implies that, in the long run, city populations will grow at common rates.

Migration provides the link between the growth and distribution of human

capital among cities and their relative populations. In Section V we analyze
migration between cities of different relative levels of human capital. The
model implies that cities where time spent acquiring human capital is more
productive will have larger populations, higher wages, higher land rents, arid

higher levels of human capital per worker, correlations consistent with the
data.7 In Section VI we provide some concluding remarks.

II. EVIDENCE ON DE1ELOP1ENT AND TILE

SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF CITIES

We have already mentioned that economic growth and urbanization are very

parallel processes. We now consider the question of how cities of different

TVe find a correlation between city population and wages and population and
price level in our French data. Rauch (1991) finds a significant positive
correlation between levels of human capital and city size in U.S. cities.
Henderson (1988) discusses other evidence on the correlation of education
levels and city size.

-6-

sizes grow during the process of development. One possibility is that
urbanization occurs as new cities develop, and as smaller cities catch up with
larger ones, in which case the size distribution of cities would become more

even over time. At the other extreme, urbanization could take the form of the
expansion of the largest cities, so that the size distribution would become
more unequal.

To examine this issue we look at historical data on urban agglomerations

from France and Japan. Ve choose France for several reasons. First, since it
is a high—income country we can observe the evolution of its urban structure

during the process of industrialization. Second, it has constituted an intact
nation—state more or less within its current borders throughout the industrial

revolution. Third, its total land area was settled at the origin of the
industrial revolution. Fourth, it is geographically large enough to contain a
number of distinct, large metropolitan areas.8 Japan shares the first three
characteristics but not the fourth. However, we have constructed data on
agglomerations for Japan that seem to be consistent for the period under
consideration.

We have collected data on the population of 39 urban agglomerations in
France for the years 1876, 1911, 1936, 1954, 1962, 1982 and 1990 (see Table

A1).9 Our criterion for selection is a 1911 population of at least 50,000

inhabitants. Only two agglomerations (Grasse—Cannes—Antibes and Bethune) nt
in our sample rank among the top 35 ciUes in 1990 (rank 17 and 19) in 1990.
The smallest agglomeration in our sample (Hagondage) ranks 50 in 1990. Hence,

8Vhile Great Britain shares the first three characteristics, because of its
much greater population density, metropolitan areas tended to blend into each
other during the process of urbanization. We could not find historical data
based on definitions of urban areas that remained consistent during the period
of interest.

9The

data are from INSEE, Annuaire StaU3tique de La France, various issues.

—7—

there are almost no new urban agglomerations since 1911 and no urban

agglomeration has fallen drastically in its relative size, i.e., no city that

was big (relatively) in 1911 has "died."°
For Japan we have organized data for the largest 40 agglomerations from

1925 to 1985 for every 5 years (see Table A2). The definition of each
agglomeration is not trivial. An appendix explains how agglomerations were
defined and how the data were constructed.11 We included all agglomerations

that had a population of at least 250 thousands in 1965. As in France, only a
few (3) agglomerations not in the sample became marginally larger than those

in the sample by the end of the period. But there is no "new" city in that
every city in the top 30 cities in Japan in 1990 was in our sample.

Similarly, none of the cities in the sample "died" in that none of the cities
in the sample ranks below 50 in 1985.

As we discussed in the introduction, the urban economics literature
addresses the issue of new cities and the optimal size of a city (e.g.,

Henderson, 1988), both in static and dynamic contexts. The evidence from
France and Japan is that there are

new cities. Even the tourist cities in

France, which may be viewed as new, existed and had a moderate size by the
beginning of the 19th century.

'°Moreover, the two towns that did grow substantially faster than the other
cities and became agglomerations that rank among the top 20 in France are
tourist centers with a significant loc3tional advantage. If the demand for
leisure and tourism is highly income elastic then the substantial increase of
French income per capita over the last 130 years can easily explain the high
growth of these two cities. Since our focus is on aggrepte growth and the
size distribution of cities that produce a common good, it seems reasonable to
ignore those cities whose location led to higher growth due to a higher income
elasticity of demand for their specialized product.
l1The data are based on historical city population census data provided in
rankeisu Showa-kokusei-Soran, vol. 1, in turn based on data from the
Statistics Bureau of the Management and Coordination Agency of the Japanese
Government. Akiko Tamura aggregated the city population data into data for
urban agglomerations. An appendix discusses agglomeration definitions and
aggregation procedures.

-8-

Lorenz Curve3

Using our French and Japanese samples of agglomerations we computed the
Lorenz curves for population for each year in our sample for France and every

second year for Japan. These are displayed in Figures 1 and 2 and in Tables
A3 and A4. The French data demonstrate starkly how the size distribution of
cities has not changed noticeably during the most spectacular period of growth
of population, movement of population from rural to urban areas, and growth of

income per capita. While the population of Paris nearly quadrupled during
this period (while that of France as a whole did not quite double) its share
of the total population of our sample of cities remained stable at 40—43

percent from 1876 to 1990. The change of ranking among the cities (up and
down within the sample) is more frequent for small cities. That is, the
relative size of a city in the sample is more stable among the largest cities.

The Japanese Lorenz curves show a slight movement towards less equal

distribution of size. The share of the larger cities went up and, in
particular, Tokyo's share increases for the whole population as well as among

the top cities. It is interesting to note that the Lorenz curve for France is
the same as the Japanese Lorenz curves for the early years. ilence, the two
countries, which are significantly different in their geographical structure,
have a very similar size distribution of cities.L2

The stability of the Lorenz curve could be the consequence of any number
of dynamic processes driving the population growth of individual cities. The
most obvious possibility is that all cities on average grow at the same rate

starting at different levels ("parallel growth"). Two possibilities are ruled

'2The "rank—order rule" also implies stable Lorenz curves. However, this rule
makes the largest city to be about 207. of the sample of 40 cities, while the
largest city is in fact much bigger (30 7. for Japan and 40 Z for France).

—9—

out, however. If there were an upper bound on city size that was attained by
any city in our sample then we would expect the initial level of population of
the city to be negatively correlated with average growth rate ("convergence of

size distribution"). The size distribution of cities would then be getting
more equal over time. On the other band, if the growth rate of a city is
positively correlated with its initial size ("divergence of size
distribution") then we would expect the Lorenz curves to exhibit increased
inequality over time.

Figure 3 displays the French average annual growth rates of the cities
from 1876 to 1990 and the initial level of each city in 1876. The regression
line implies that there is no correlation between the initial size of the

agglomeration and the growth rate during that period. (The slope coefficient

is —1x10 with a S.E. of 1.56x1O.) Figure 4 presents the equivalent
picture for the Japanese cities. Here, as well, there is no obvious
correlation between the initial level of population and its subsequent growth.

The slope is positive but not significant(1.3x109 with a S.E.of .8x109).
This result is consistent with stability of the Lorenz curves as well as with
parallel growth. 13

Size and oiher Features

For France we also have data on the average salary per full—time employee

in each agglomeration in 1982 and 1989 (Table A5). A regression of wage
income on population of the agglomeration yields a positive and significant

coefficient for each year separately (see Table la). Furthermore, the

l3The results in Figures 2 and 3 are similar to Barro's (1991) on the
relationship between per—capita income growth and the initial level of income
per capita in the Summers and ileston (1991) country data.

—10—

coefficients of the two years estimated separately turned out to be close.
Hence, wages are higher in larger cities following a stable relationship.

Table lb reports the regression of the price of housing on city size, which
indicates that larger cities have a higher cost of housing.'4

Evolving Size Distri but ion.

Quah (1993) provides a statistical method to make further observations on
the cross—section dynamics of relative levels and growth rates of income per
capita in ternis of evolving distributions. Following Quah's procedure, we
group the two samples of cities into 6 cells defined according to a division
of population sizes relative to the average population for the respective

period. To examine the sensitivity of the results to the particular cell
division, we use different assignments, but we report only one division which
is

the same for both France and

Japan and is reported as the row headings in

Tables 2 and 3. (Alternative cell divisions provided very similar results.)
Our division classifies cities according to whether their population fell

in the range: (1) less than .30 of the mean, (2) between .30 and .50 of the
mean, (3) between .50 and .75 of the mean, etc. These tables show the
frequency distribution and numbers corresponding to each cell. The stability
of these distributions across time and the similarity between France and Japan
is

of course another manifestation of the observations we made about the

Lorenz

curves that we described above.

Ve define Ft as a 6x1—vector indicating the frequency of cities in each

cell at time t. Ve assume that F evolves according to:

'4The data for this regression are from 1982, and are available for only 20
agglomerations.

Ft

where I is a 6x6 matrix mapping the assignment from period t into an

assignment the subsequent period. An element of this matrix denotes the
probability with which a city initially in the cell corresponding to that

column transits into the cell corresponding to that row. The s—period—ahead
predictor for the distribution is thus:

F

t+s

Taking

s

to

1SFt

we can characterize the long run

(ergodic)

distribution of Ft,

defined as F (if it exists and is unique).
Defining K i+1 as the actual transition matrix from period i to period
i+l, we have estimated the matrix I by computing the average I i+1 for all

the periods in the sample. The estimated I matrices for France and Japan are
given in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. The large values of the diagonal terms
and the many low values and zeros of the off—diagonal terms of both matrices

indicate high persistence. For France, diagonal terms tend to increase with
relative size, indicating more persistence for larger cities. For Japan, the
diagonal terms are higher for small and large cities than for medium—sized

cities. Overall, the values on the diagonal are higher for Japan than for
France

and

there are no off—diagonal trms for the highest cell in the

Japanese matrix. These results suggest that there is more persistence in the
Japanese data, no movement in and out of the cell containing the largest 3
cities, and less movement among the smaller cities than is the case for
France.

The ergodic probability distribution is estimated by taking the average

—12—

of the implied ergodic distribution from each date in the sample using the

estimated average period—to—period transition matrix. That is, using the
estimated M we calculated F by first calculating, for each year in the data:

=

1

and then estimated F as the simple average of F. These values are reported
in Tables 6 and 7 for France and Japan, respectively. Concentration of the
frequencies around one would imply convergence to the mean. The results show
no such convergence for either country. For France, about 907. of the cities

will be below the average. Only few cities will be above the average size.
About 597. of the cities will be less than one half of the average size. The
results for Japan are similar: 887. of the cities are below average and 757,

are below one half of the average. Hence, the dispersion of population in
Japan is expected to be less equal than that for France (as was also suggested
by the movement of the Lorenz curves).

The predicted relative size of Paris will be smaller and there will be

fewer cities that are large. That is, compared with the historic relative
frequency for France, the ergodic frequency has more weight on the smaller
cells. In 1990 the larger than average cities in France are about 157. of the
total and their share will drop to about 107.. For Japan, as we explained

above, there is almost no change at th top but a small increase in the share
of the smaller cities relative to 1985 distribution.

Hence, the evidence rejects a divergence hypothesis and is consistent
with parallel growth with a somewhat less disperse distribution for France.
In particular, Paris and the other larger cities would be somewhat closer to

the average size. Similarly Japan displays no evidence of convergence. In

—13—

summary, the data support the view that a wide range of city sizes will
persist.

III. A IODEL OF A CITY

We now develop a model of a system of cities with features that reflect
our empirical findings on the size distribution of French and Japanese cities,

and correlations between city size and other city characteristics. Our theory
has the implication that cities' populations converge to a common growth rate,

with different relative populations. A city's relative size depends upon its
productivity as a place to acquire human capital. In steady state, wages per
worker are higher in larger cities because the level of human capital per

worker is higher. City populations adjust to remove any incentive to migrate.
We describe each of K individual cities in terms of a representative

resident who lives, works, and learns in that city. We pursue our analysis in
three steps. Step 1, presented below, describes the preferences and the
static production technology for a typical city. Here we characterize the
equilibrium relationships between wage, population, and city area implied by
the maximization problem of the representative resident.'5 Step 2, undertaken
is Section IV, considers human capital accumulation and growth in a typical
city, again in terms of the maximization problem of the representative

resident of that city, ignoring the possibility of migration. Here we provide
conditions for steady—state growth in the system of cities. Step 3, discussed
in Section V, treats the incentive for a representative resident to migrate,
and its consequences for relative city size.

'5Our static model of production takes much from the literature on circular
cities. See, for example, lills (1967), Helpman and Pines (1980), and
Henderson (1987).

—14—

Endowrneni3 and Tasles

The representative resident of each city supplies a unit of labor each

period regardless of the wage. Residents are infinitely—lived (or behave
dynastically), and maximizes an objective function:

V0 J e_Ptln(ct)dt

,

p

0,

where c is period t consumption. Residents do not worry about the amenities
that different cities offer except as they affect income.

Techno logy

To focus on the issues at hand, we assume that labor and land are the
only factors of production.'6 These factors produce a single kind of output,

which has a price one each period. Production is Cobb—Douglas in labor and
land, with land having a share fi.

Total

factor productivity in each city i is

affected by a city—specific multiplicative factor A1. At this point in the
analysis, this term could reflect the level of technology used in the city,
the average level of human capital of its work force, or city infrastructure,

among other things. We pursue the second of these possible interpretations,
allowing total factor productivity to evolve over time, in Section IV below.
Ve introduce the notion of urban land scarcity in a very simple way.
Total factor productivity diminishes with distance from the city center.

Specifically, output a distance d from the center, d' is:

t6As long as capital is perfectly mobile across cities, its incorporation into
the analysis is straightforward and inconsequential.

fi,

C E (0,1)

(2)

where Ld is the labor input a distance d from the center of the city and, of

course, 21d is the land input. (Since our focus here is on a single city, we
omit the city—subscript i.) Total factor productivity a distance d from the

city center is Ad', where parameter

is the elasticity of total factor

productivity with respect to distance from the city center. We restrict the
land share fi

to

exceed E/2.

Otherwise one city would absorb the entire

population, as indicated by equation (6) below.

Factors earn their (private) marginal products, so that payments to land

and labor exhaust output. Worker mobility within the city establishes a
common city wage V. For the private marginal product of labor to be equal
across the city the amount of labor working a distance d from the center must
be:

Ld 2T{Ad[(1—fi)/W]}.

(3)

The corresponding land rent is:

Rd =

${Ad[(1_fi)/V]1}1,

which falls as distance from the center increases.

Land has an alternative nonurban use that yields Ra The distance from
the center at which Rd has fallen to Ra establishes the city limits D. This
condition relates the radius of the city D to the wage V and to the average

level of productivity A. Solving for V:

—16—

V =

(1fl)[AD(fl/R)fJh/().

(4)

Hence a city's wage increases with its total factor productivity A, but falls
with its area D (or equivalently, as we show next, with its labor force L).
Substituting (4) into (3) and integrating across all urban locations from
the city center to the city limits gives an expression for the urban labor
force L in terms of city radius D and total factor productivity A:

L

where I'

.[RDf/(sA)]l/(l_fi)

(5)

2(1—5)÷. This expression implies that greater total factor

productivity reduces the labor force, given city area. The reason is that a
smaller labor input is needed to offset the effect of greater total factor
productivity on rent.

Finally, (4) and (5) together provide an expression for the wage in terms
of productivity and the effective labor force, with the area determined
endogenously:

W =

(1_fl){[2Tfl/(2fl_E)](fi/Ra)2flA2L}1/'•

(6)

As one would expect, given its labor force, the wage in a city is higher the

higher total factor productivity and, iven total factor productivity, the
smaller the labor force.

Expression (6) relates the wage per unit of effective labor in a city to

the city's effective labor force and its total factor productivity. To
construct the equilibrium configuration of cities we need a theory of

intercity migration. Simply postulating that labor is perfectly mobile across

—17—

cities, and that workers seek out the highest wage, would imply that cities
with higher total factor productivity will have larger effective labor forces.

In the next section we develop a theory of total factor productivity growth

based on the accumulation of human capital. The level of total factor
productivity is consequently endogenous. The implications for migration and
city size are not as straightforward. Nevertheless, the association between
higher total factor productivity and greater population remains. We defer the
determination of relative city size and migration to Section V.

A DYNAJIC MODEL OF LEARNING AND URBAN GROWTh

IV.

We now develop a theory of total factor productivity growth generated by
investment in human capital. The accumulation of human capital in

each

city

derives from the dynamic optimization problem facing the representative

resident of that city. We characterize the solution to that problem and
provide conditions under which the decisions of the representative
of

residents

different cities lead to steady—state growth in a system of K cities

interconnected by

knowledge

flows.

To simplify things we assume that the nonurban

cities

rent

is

common to all

and remains constant over time. Denoting the physical labor force in

city i as N, the average level of human capital in that city as Ii, and the
average time worked per worker as e1, the effective labor supply in city i is

L1 =

We follow Lucas (1988) in assuming that the average level of

human capital in the community influences total factor productivity there,

although we treat the community as the city rather than the country.'7 Hence

'7Again, allowing productivity to depend on the national average level of human
capital as well as on the average city level would not affect our basic
results. What is key is that the city average matter.

capital to its total factor productivity.

luman Capiial Accumulation and Growth

Incorporating the expression for effective labor into expressions (5) and

(6),

and differentiating with respect to time gives an expression (with e held

constant) for the growth in the wage per unit of effective labor:

—

(27—e)g

—

cg

so that growth in the wage per physical worker, which in steady state is the
growth rate in per capita output and consumption, is:

2(1—fi+7)g11 —

cg
(8)

While more rapid accumulation of human capital can lover growth in the
wage per unit of effective labor, it always means higher consumption growth.

Whether per capita consumption grows or falls over time depends upon whether
the effect of human capital accumulation overcomes the congestion effects of
population growth.
We now consider what determines the rate of human capital accumulation.

Learning

As in Lucas (1988), workers must take time off from work to acquire human

—19—

capital. Workers have a time endowment of 1 out of which to choose time at

work e. The rest of the time they learn.

Also

as in Lucas, productivity of time spent learning increases with what

has been learned already, but Lucas assumes that the individual's own level of

capital

human

is what matters. Instead, we posit that learning productivity

depends upon a linear combination of the average levels of human capital in
each city.18 Moreover, we assume that cities differ intrinsically in the

environment that they provide for acquiring human capital. Our specific
assumption is that the increase in a worker k's level of human capital hkjt in
city i is:

hkit =

where

(9)

Hl(l_-ek)

11it is the knowledge base that an individual in city i draws upon in

acquiring human capital. Here ek1 is worker k's own time spent working (so

that l—ek is worker k's time learning).
We make the specific assumption that:

111t =

where

reflects the contribution oLcity j's average level of human capital

to learning in city i.

If city i has larger values of

than some other

city then it is a more productive place to learn, while if city j

values of

has larger

than some other city then its human capital contributes more to

learning. To the extent that the matrix of 6's is heavily diagonal dominant

'8Allowing productivity of learning time to depend on the worker's own level of
human capital as well would not materially affect our analysis.

—20—

then growth is largely generated by factors specific to the city in question.
Less diagonal dominance implies more pooling of knowledge across cities.

Single—City Dynamics

We assume that cities are connected by a common capital market, so that
individuals in any city can borrow and lend at a given interest rate r, which

we treat as constant. Since we ignore leisure and risk, optimal learning
decisions maximize the discounted present value of wage income. Hence we need
only concern ourselves with workers' decisions about allocating time between
learning and working, which are independent of their decisions about consuning
and saving.

At each period t, then, individual k in city i with human capital hkjt

chooses ekl to maximize:

I

subject to the equation of motion (9).

Solving the problem for individual k in city i implies that, at an
interior solution (in which an individual both learns and works):

r +

where

gj

— g

=

Hjt/hkit.

(10)

is the growth of the wage in city i, and gj is the growth rate of
i

i

city i's knowledge base.

Condition (10) is independent of ek itself. The reason is that the

—21—

returns to working and learning are each linear in time spent in that

activity. Hence, at an interior solution, an individual is indifferent
between the two undertakings. If the individual is both learning and working,
then the two activities must yield that person the same marginal, and hence
average, return.

oreover, if the right—hand side of expression (10) exceeds the left then
the (average and marginal) returns to learning exceed the returns to working
so that the individual only learns, while if the left—hand side exceeds the
right the individual only works.

For the representative resident of a city (for whom hkjt

H1t) to be

willing both to work and to learn, then, requires that:

r +

gj1

= H/H

(10')

A particular implication of expressions (10) and (10'), which is
important to the migration decision that we analyze below and in the appendix,
is that an immigrant arriving in a city in which the representative resident

is both working and learning will eventually become assimilated. An immigrant
arriving with a level of human capital below the city average will find the
reward to learning strictly greater than the reward to working, so will only

learn. The immigrant's human capital will consequently grow faster than the
city average until it catches up. Conversely, an immigrant arriving with a
level of human capital above the city average will find the reward to working

strictly greater than the reward to learning, so will only work. Since the

—22—

immigrant's human capital level stops growing, the city average will

eventually catch up with that of the immigrant. Either way, the immigrant
eventually becomes just like the representative resident of the city of
destination.

Steady-St ate growth

In

steady state: (i) each city's average level of human capital and

population (and hence, by equations (4) and (5), each city's area and wage)

grow at the same rate; (ii) each individual's human capital corresponds to
the city—wide average; (iii) individuals have no reason to migrate between
cities. Criteria (i) and (ii) determine the steady—state growth rate of human
capital, while criteria (iii) establishes relative steady—state populations.

We first establish conditions under which a unique steady—state growth rate
exists, and then turn to the determination of relative city size in Section V.

We have already noted that, within a city, the average level of human

capital will move toward the average for that city. Criterion (i) implies
that expression (10') hold for each city, with the same left—hand side

applying to each city. Hence the right—hand side must be equal across cities
as well.

Individuals' savings and consumption decisions determine the nationwide

interest rate r. With Bernoulli preferences the steady—state interest rate
equals the pure rate of time preference plus the growth in per capita
equal to the growth in human capital plus the growth in the

consumption,

wage per unit

of

effective labor. Hence:

r=P+g=p+g11+g

(11)

—23—

Substituting (11) into (10') implies that, in steady state, for each city

Since the left—hand side of expression (12) is independent of i, we can

Steady—state growth requires that this system have an eigenvalue that

exceeds p whose corresponding eigenvector is nonnegative. Since A is
nonnegative, Frobenius' theorem ensures that if A is also indecomposable then
it has a real eigenvalue A1 (the Frobenius root) where:

(v) F is increasing in each element of A.19

These properties ensure that if A is indecomposable and its elements are
sufficiently large then there exists a unique steady state growth rate of

The corresponding eigenvector

relative steady—state levels of human capital. lore knowledge spillovers
imply higher growth. If, however, the elements of 5 are so small that

The matrix A is indecomposable if there is no ordering of its elements
that allows it to be partitioned as:

If A is decomposable then the cities corresponding to the elements of
A22, what we call the isolated set of cities, do not receive spillovers from

any city corresponding to the elements of A. Even if A is decomposable,
however, it still has a Frobenius root

positive element (so that the set of cities corresponding to the elements of

A11 are nonisolated) and Au and A22 have Frobenius roots 4 and 4 such that

The levels of human capital in the entire set

cities drive the growth of the others. If, however, 4 < 4 and 4 > p then
the isolated cities eventually grow more slowly than the nonisolated set, and

Other things equal, the city in which the contribution of existing knowledge
to learning is greater has a relatively higher level of human capital.

So far we have established conditions for the parallel growth of human

capital across cities. Ye do not, however, have observations on the human
capital levels of the cities but on their populations. Our theory implies
that if the population of each city is also growing at a common rate, then so
are wages and consumption, with parameters of technology linking the growth of
human capital and population, on one hand, to the growth of wages and
consumption, on the other.

Individual migration decisions link the distribution and growth of human

capital to the size distribution of cities. Ye now turn to the migration
decision of the representative resident of each city, and consider conditions
under which the parallel growth of human capital levels across cities implies

—26—

growth of populations.

IIGLLTION AND CITY SIZE

We now turn to the third criterion for a steady state, that the
representative resident of each city have no incentive to migrate elsewhere.
This criterion determines relative city populations in steady state.

The cit'-specificiiy of human capita1

An issue is the degree to which the human capital acquired by someone in

one city contributes to that individual's productivity elsewhere. At one
extreme, human capital might be perfectly general, and augment labor

productivity by the same amount anywhere. At the other extreme, human capital
might be totally city—specific, not enhancing

productivity

anywhere except

where it was acquired.
We introduce the parameter

to deflate human capital acquired elsewhere

than in the city where it is used. A migrant from city i to j with an amount
of human capital h acquired in the city of origin will arrive in city j with

an amount of human capital h. Hence a value of
capital is fully general, while

=

1

implies that human

= 0 implies that it is completely

city—specific.

In analyzing a decision to migrate we need to distinguish between a move
to a city where the migrant's human capital, upon arrival, will be lower than
the average of the city of destination and a move to a city where the migrant

will find his own level of human capital above average. We undertake this

—2 7—

analysis for an individual contemplating a move in an economy that is in
steady state.

loving up

Consider first an individual's decision about whether or not to migrate

from city i—i to city i, where Hi > H_1. The immigrant would arrive in city
i with a lover level of human

capital

than the destination average. We showed

in part IV that, upon arrival, the immigrant would devote all available time
to learning until becoming assimilated with the representative resident in the

destination city. Wage income during this training period would be zero, but

it was over the immigrant would resume working the steady—state amount.

once

We denote the steady—state present income of an individual

with human

capital h remaining thereafter in a city with an average level of human

capital H as V(h,H). We derive this function for the cases h=H, h<H, and h>H
in the appendix.

Hence the value to the potential migrant of remaining at hone is given by
as given in equation (Al) in the appendix, while the value of

moving to city i and remaining there is V(Hi,H1), with V taking the form
given in expression (A2).
Hence there is an incentive to migrate from city i—i to city i if

V(Hi,H) > V(H11,H_1).

For the wage differential to remove this

incentive, the radius of city i must exceed that of i—i by at least the ratio:

(14)

where

=

HIH11

is the ratio of human capital city at rank i to that of

—28—

city at rank i—i, and g11 =

()Y—p)/2, the

steady—state growth rate of human

capital.

The city with the higher steady—state level of human capital must have a

larger area in order to deter migration from the lower human capital city. It
must also have more effective labor, and a larger population, as can be seen
by combining this expression with (5), to obtain:

=

(15)

and, since L1 H1N, where N1 is the physical population of city i:

=

(16)

These expressions are lower bounds on how much the size of a city with
higher human capital must exceed that of a city with lower human capital to

remove migration incentives. If this bound is violated, workers in the lower
human capital city have an incentive to migrate to the higher human capital
city.

Note that this lower bound on the relative population of city i to that
of city i—i depends on all the parameters of the model, which we assume are
the same for all cities, and on the ratio of human capital of the two cities.

loving Down

Eliminating the corresponding incentive to move from a high to a low
human capital city places an upper bound on how much the size of the high

—29—

human capital city can exceed that of the low human

capital

city. To

establish these bounds consider now an individual in city i contemplating a

move to city i—i, where

>

H11.

Since the immigrant arrives with a level of human capital that exceeds
the average in the destination city, the immigrant's incentive is to work full

time, not learning at all, until the human capital level in the city has

caught up to the immigrant's level. The potential migrant now compares the
value of staying home, V(111,H) as given by (Al), with that moving to city

i—i. The value of making this move permanently is V(H,E_1), where the
relevant expression for V is given by (A3).
To remove the incentive to migrate from city i to city i—i, the maximum
amount by which city i's radius can exceed that of city i—i is:

where:

0=(p+g11)e*

and e = (F+P)/2AFis the steady—state work effort.
If city i—i were any smaller relative to city i, it would attract

immigration from the larger city. The maximum difference in human capital is:

=

(f27)/([(10)(,Pig11

while the maximum population difference is:

+

(16')

A steady state requires that the lower bound not exceed the upper bound.
The interval of permissible city sizes falls as

rises. In our simulations

the interval became negative with strictly positive discounting (p>O) and
values of

very close to one. The implication is that, with discounting, a

steady—state outcome with multiple cities requires some element of city
specificity of human capital (Or some other form of moving cost).20 With
discounting but no impediment to migration, residents have an incentive to
switch cities occasionally, moving to lower human capital cities when their
human capital is high and working there full time, but later moving to higher
human capital city to replenish their human capital.

The rest of our discussion here posits that values of ' and p guarantee a

steady state with no equilibrium migration. We discuss two particular cases
in which a steady state is guaranteed:

fully city—3pecific human capital

Say that

=

0, so that knowledge acquired in one city has no value

elsewhere. In this case there is no possibility of "moving down," since one
arrives anywhere new with no human capital that is appropriate for the city of

destination. Moreover, there is no reason to migrate temporarily to a high
human capital city for the purpose of learning since any

knowledge acquired

200ur calculations compare the value of staying in the city of origin with that
of a permanent move to another city. Hence the bounds that we derive are
necessary but not sufficient for a steady state: A steady state could be
upset by the temptation to undertake even a temporary move to another city. A
sufficiently close to zero (or some other sufficiently high transport cost)
can render even temporary moves unattractive, however, as we discuss below.

—31—

there would be useless anywhere else. Expressions (14), (15), and (16),
evaluated at =O, thus provide lower bounds on the extent to which the area,
effective labor force, and population of city i can exceed those of city i—i.

The upper bounds are given by the condition that V(O,1111) < V(H1,H), i.e.,
that it is not worthwhile moving to the lower human capital city to start over

there. This upper bound necessarily exceeds the lower bound established by

the condition that V(H11,H11) > V(O,H1).

zero discointing

In the special case in which there is no pure time discounting (p=O) only
steady state human capital levels matter in determining comparisons across

cities. The lower and upper bounds on city radius, effective labor, and
population differences converge to:

respectively.

In this special case, then, relative steady state city size leaves the
residents of each city indifferent between staying put or moving to any other,

—32—

larger or smaller, city. The city—specificity of human capital makes no
difference since the destination city's level of human capital is always

acquired in finite time. The larger size (or, equivalently, higher land
rents) of cities where learning is more productive make them equally
attractive as cities where learning is less productive.

Equation (16") thus provides a simple relation between average levels of

human capital and the relative population of the cities. This relationship
depends on all the parameters of the model (which we treat as common to all
cities) and relative total factor productivities (which in our analysis are

determined by relative average levels of human capital) among cities. More
generally, with potential migration, relative population levels provide a
fairly tight, but possibly not exact, measure of the relative levels of total
factor productivity in different locations.

The model thus provides an explanation for the observed stability of the

relative populations of cities. The spillover of knowledge between and within
cities determines the common rate of growth of total factor productivity of

all cities, and their ranking. The migration decision then implies a
restriction on the distribution of population among cities. Without
discounting, the relative human capital level of a city uniquely determines

its relative size. With discounting the growth rate of human capital, which
is equal across cities, has an effect on the bounds of the city size as well.
Simulation results indicate that, with plausible parameter values, very small
differences in steady—state human capital levels (around 5

per cent) can imply

large differences in city populations and areas.

Raising

among

cities, but from (16") we can see that the distribution of city sizes become

—33—

flatter, so that the ratio

is smaller. Hence the shape of the Lorenz

curves is affected by both the process of human capital accumulation and the

parameters of the production function and preferences. However, if these
parameters are stable, the dynamic structure of human capital accumulation
alone can explain the stability of the Lorenz curve, and our observation that
there are no "new" cities and that no City "dies."

VI. CONCLUSION

The French and Japanese experiences provide striking evidence that, while
the process of development is associated with a significant increase in urban
population, it has had little effect on the distribution of population among

different urban areas. This finding suggests that the forces driving the
process of industrialization are present in individual cities in proportion to
their initial populations.

In economies with labor mobility, per capita output or wages are a poor
indicator of total factor productivity across regions.2' We have developed an
equilibrium model in which relative populations reflect total factor

productivity differentials across cities. Hence, the observed parallel growth
of urban populations in France and in Japan can be interpreted as evidence for

parallel growth in total factor productivity across cities. The model also
suggests how cities can serve as a fundamental force in the process of
industrialization.

The structural link between the dynamic process of human capital growth

21Land rents would provide a much better measure. Unfortunately data on land
rents are rarely available comprehensively. An exception is Japanese data on
land values by prefecture. Dekie and Eaton (1993) explore their implications
for measuring agglomeration effects in manufacturing and in financial
services.

—34--

and the growth and distribution of population among cities is the central

aspect of the theory. This link implies that we can use the data on the
populations of cities to measure the pattern of growth of total factor

productivity. In this paper we use this implication to interpret the
stability of the Lorenz curves.

Our theory, taken literally, would also imply that the matrix describing
the transition of cities across relative sizes (I, in equation (1)) is

diagonal. we found in section II, however, that the matrix M includes off
diagonal terms. We interpret these off diagonal terms using a stochastic
version of the model in a sequel to this paper.

Our theory is compatible with many possible relationships among cities in

a growing country. One possibility is that the matrix & of knowledge
spillovers is nearly diagonal, which would suggest that cities are largely
"self relia.nt" in terms of their growth. In this case the process of economic

development is best thought of in terms of the city. Another possibility is
that off—diagonal elements are large, in which case the growth of individual

cities is highly interconnected. In this case the nation or some broader unit
might provide the more appropriate unit of analysis. In our sequel paper we
use the stochastic formulation of our analysis to estimate knowledge
spillovers themselves.
Our analysis also has implications for the relationship between migration

and development. It suggests, for example, how changes in the way knowledge
flows across locations, as well as changes in land shares and urban
transportation technology and infrastructure, would affect migration patterns

and relative city size. Extensions of the analysis could also have
implications for the relationship between migration and human capital

accumulation. The analysis above suggests that migrants moving toward more

—35—

populated cities would tend to be less educated than average upon arrival, but
would acquire hunian capital more quickly once they arrive. Migrants to less
populated regions would have the opposite characteristics.

APPENDIX A: Migration and City Size

Here we derive the total discounted wage income, at some time 0, of an

individual with human capital h0 remaining thereafter in city i. City i has
an average level of human capital 11i0' which we assume is growing at the
steady—state rate g11. We denote the discounted wage earnings of this

individual as V(ho,Ho). In deriving this amount we need to distinguish
three cases:

1. The representative resident:

The discounted present wage income of the representative resident, for
whom h0 =

H10,

is simply:

V(HO,HIO) =

where e* =

(,F+p)/2A,

=

e*''°

(Al)

the steady—state amount of time spent working.

2. The below—average resident:

Consider now a resident whose human capital is initially below the city

average, so that h0 < 11i0• Expression (10) implies that this resident will
choose e =

0 as long as ht < H1t.

How long does it take to acquire the city's average level of human

capital? Define the ratio of the city—average level of human capital to that

of the below—average resident at time t as x =

H,t/ht.

The above—average resident

Finally, expression (10) implies that a resident with human capital
initially above the city average (for whom h0 >

11i,O)

will spend no tine

learning as long as ht remains above HtO. Hence this individual's human
capital does not grow at all while the city average grows at rate

until

the city average catches up.

Let Td denote how long it will take the average level of human capital in

—40—

the city to reach that of the initially above—average resident. To calculate
Td, denote the ratio of the resident's human capital level to the city—average
as

The first term is discounted wage income during

the period when the resident's human capital exceeds the city average, when no

effort is devoted to human capital formation. The second term reflects
earnings once the city's average human capital level meets that of the
above—average individual's, at which point the individual reduces his work
effort to e*.

Data Appendix
Japanese Agglomerations
Akiko Tamura

The data are based on the population census taken every 5
years from 1925 to 1985 (except 1947 instead of 1945), calculated
by the city's legal border in 1980, by the Statistics Bureau of
the Management and Coordination Agency. In 1980 there were 650
cities in Japan.
We created about 60 agglomerations according to the
following procedures:
First, we took the largest 100 cities in 1955, and then
aggregated the surrounding small cities' populations with that of
each large city. The basic criteria for selection are
1) Tokyo --- within a radius of 45 kilometers from Shinjuku.
Tokyo includes 84 cities other than 23 special districts. Most
of the cities in Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saitama prefectures are
included in Tokyo.

2) Osaka, Nagoya ---

within

a radius of 30 kilometers.

3) The 6 "Designated Cities": Sapporo, Sendai, Kyoto, Hiroshima,
Kitakyushu, Fukuoka --- within a radius of 25 kilometers.
(In 1993, 12 cities were "Designated Cities." These cities are
given 17 categories of administrative responsibilities otherwise
assigned to the prefectural government, such as welfare, health,
and city planning. Of these 12 we separate Osaka and Nagoya
because of their size. We have assigned Yokohama, Kawasaki, and
Chiba to the Tokyo agglomeration and Kobe to Osaka.
4) Other cities —--

within

a radius of 20 kilometers

The number in the parenthesis following the city name shows
how many small cities are included in its metropolitan area other
than the city itself. In some cases, two similarly—sized cities
are within 40Km circle. We then call the agglomeration by the
name of both cities, for example, Maebashi/Takasaki, Numazu/Fuji,
and Okayama/Kurashiki
Some exceptions occur where indicated by geographical and
traffic conditions. For example, for Tokyo(with a 90Km
diameter), we exclude Kisarazu since it is separated from Tokyo
by Tokyo Bay, but we include Yokosuka, which is 47 Km from
Shinjuku but connected by a fast express line to Tokyo.
If circles overlap, then the small cities in the overlapping
area are aggregated with the nearer city unless: i) the sizes of
two central cites' are significantly different, in which case the
city is aggregated with the larger of the two central cities (For
example, in the case of Osaka and Kyoto, the small cities in the

overlapping area are in Osaka; ii) the prefectural border
crosses the overlapping area, in which case the small cities are
aggregated with the central city in same prefecture.
