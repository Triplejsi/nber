FLUCTUATIONS, INSTABILITY.
AND AGGLOMERATION

ABSTRACT

Recent models in economic geography suggest that there may be very large numbers of
equilibrium spatial structures. Simulations suggest, however. that the sUuctures that emerge are

surprisingly orderly, and often seem approximately to follow simple rules about the spacing of
urban sites. This paper offers an explanation in terms of the process by which a spatial economy

diverges away from an even distribution of activity across the landscape. It shows that a small
divergence of activity away from spatial uniformity. even if it is highly irregular, can be regarded

as the sum of a number of simple periodic fluctuations at different spatial "wavelengths"; these

fluctuations grow at different rates. There is a particular "prefened wavelength" that grows
fastes provided thaL the initial distribution of activity across space is flat enough, this prefened

wavelength eventually dominates the spatial pattern and becomes the typical distance between
cities. The approach sug g e sts that surprisingly simple principles of self-organization may lie
beneath the surface of models that appear at first to yield hopelessly complex possibilities.

Over the

last few years there has been a substantial revival

of interest in regional and urban economics. Much of this revival
is due to the rediscovered usefulness of regions and metropolitan
areas as empirical laboratories, whose evolution Can shed light on

such questions as the nature of the macroeconomic adjustment
process or the character of external economies. There has also,

been a resurgence

however,

of theoretical work on spatial

economics, thanks in large part to the application of modeling
previously

techniques

developed

in industrial

organization,

international trade, and growth theory.

In several recent papers (Krugman 1991, 1992, 1993a, 1993b) I

have explored one particular approach to spatial modeling that,

while admittedly capturing only some of the reasons why spatial

structure emerges in real economies, has the virtue of being
particularly easy to work with. In this approach, an economy with

two or more locations is assumed to consist of two sectors: a
constant—returns, geographically immobile sector ("agriculture"),
and

an

increasing—returns,

competitive,
When

one adds

transportation costs in the manufacturing sector, and also adds

some simple dynamics, models of this type exhibit spontaneous
spatial

self—organization: even if all locations are identical in

resources and technology, manufacturing firms have an incentive to
concentrate production close to the markets and supplies that other
manufacturing

firms

provide,

thus producing a °centripetal"

tendency toward agglomeration. Working against this ceritripetal
tendency,

however,

is the "centrifugal" pull of the immobile

2

agricultural sector.

In a two—location model, the tension between centripetal and

centrifugal forces can be treated analytically; one can derive a
criterion,

depending in an economically meaningful way on the
which determines

parameters,

whether or not manufacturing

concentrates in one location. Beyond this case, however, it becomes

very difficult to derive analytical results. Simulations show that
there

may be equilibria with multiple manufacturing concentrations:

they also indicate that as the number of locations grows, there
typically start to be a very large number of equilibria.

manufacturing on a linear, landscape, for example, one typically
finds that a roughly regular spacing of manufacturing
concentrations

emerges. Furthermore, the distance between these

concentrations is relatively insensitive to the starting position,
and appears to depend in a sensible way on the model's parameters.

It is easy to offer some

would like a more specific explanation. Mid one would like a model

of the model —— something that helps us to understand what our
computer is telling us.

In this paper I offer a somewhat novel approach that helps
explain the behavior of these particular models, and that may turn

3

out to have application in a variety of spatial models. Instead of

focussing on the long—run equilibrium that the economy eventually
attains, this approach focusses on the process of divergence away

from the unstable equilibrium in which manufacturing is evenly
distributed across space.

In what sense is an even distribution of manufacturing
unstable?

Suppose that the actual distribution is slightly

perturbed away from perfect flatness. Such a perturbation, even if

it is highly irregular, can be thought of as a Fourier series (in

space, of course, rather than time) —— the sum of a number of
periodic

fluctuations, with different wavelengths. And some of

these periodic fluctuations will tend to be self—reinforcing,
growing over time. In particular, we can show that there is one

wavelength that is the most unstable in the sense that a
fluctuation at that wavelength tends to grow more rapidly than

fluctuations at any other wavelength. Given enough time, this

spatial wavelength Will dominate the

divergence from even

distribution —— and the peaks and valleys of the divergence will

dictate the locations of the eventual agglomerations. Thus the
spacing of manufacturing concentrations will be approximately equal

to the preferred wavelenath of the dynamic process of divergence,
a preferred wavelength that is determined by the parameters of the
model.

In particular, the preferred wavelength is

inversely

proportionalto transportation costs and positively related both to
the degree of scale economies and to the share of manufacturing in
the economy.

4

The paper begins with a review of the general approach to
spatial dynamics used here, and describes the suggestive results of

some simulation exercises. It then turns to a specific model of a
linear economy, and shows how the evolution of this model near an

even distribution of manufacturing can be viewed in terms of the
growth rates of fluctuations of different frequencies. Finally, the

paper shows why the economy has a preferred wavelength, and how
this wavelength depends on the parameters.

1. A basic siatial modI

Consider an economy in which there are a number of locations,
indexed by j

1...J. Let DJk be the distance between any pair of

locations j and k.

In this economy there are two factors of production: immobile

"farmers" and mobile "workers". It will be convenient to choose
units so that there are a total of ],— farmers and u workers. Also,

in this paper I will restrict attention to economies in which

structure is completely endogenous, so the farmers will be
assumed to be equally divided among the locations.
Everyone in this economy shares the same tastes, which may be
spatial

represented by a two—level structure. At the upper level, there are

Each factor is specific to the production of one sector.
Farmers produce agricultural output with constant returns to scale.

Workers produce manufactured goods. There are economies of scale in

this production, specific both to the firm and to the particular
variety produced; these are represented as a linear cost function,

We also

introduce

transport

costs.

(3)

For the sake of

tractability, there are assumed to be zero transport costs for
agricultural goods. Transport costs on manufactured goods are of

transportation cost per unit distance.

It is a familiar proposition that if we take the spatial

distribution of workers as given, a model of the form just
described yields a monopolistically competitive equilibrium in
which all profits are competed away. This equilibrium includes an
equilibrium level of the real wage at each location: differences in

these real wage rates are what drive the economy's dynamics.

Workers are assumed to move gradually toward locations that

offer them above—average real wages. Let

be the fraction of

workers currently in location . Then the average real wage rate
can be defined as a weighted average of real wage rates at each

any point in time can usefully be described as the simultaneous

solution of four sets of equations. First, the income of any

These equations are fairly simple, and are very easy to solve
numerically —— one simply starts with guesses at the wage and true

and iterates over (6)

(I), and (8) until

convergence. Analytical results, however, in anything larger than
a two-region model, are another matter. Thus to date explorations

of multi—location settings have relied on numerical examples. In

the next section I briefly describe one set of examples, as a
motivation for the subsequent discussion.

2. Evidence from numerical exarn1es.

In an effort to understand the formation of systems of cities,

I carried out a series of simulations on a particular version of
the model described in part 1; these results are reported both in
Krugman (1992) and Krugman 1993a.

In these simulations the economy

was assumed to consist of 12 locations symmetrically placed around
a circle, like a clock face. (The number 12 was chosen because it
is a relatively small number with a large number of divisors). Each

run

with a random allocation of manufacturing across

For the most interesting range of parameters, the result of
these experiments was that 'the model economy organized itself into

a spatial structure with all manufacturing in 2 or 3 locations,

more or less symmetrically located around the circle. Figure 1
illustrates the results of a typical run, with the first set of
bars representing the initial shares of manufacturing, the second

set the final shares. In this case all manufacturing ended up in
locations 6 and 11, almost but not quite opposite each other on the

circle. For the parameters used for this run, about 60 percent of

the runs led to two cities 5

apart, almost all other runs to two

and a few runs to three symmetrically placed

cities.
At one level these examples demonstrate the complexity of the
possible outcomes, even in such a relatively small model. After

9

all, there are 12 ways to locate concentrations 5 apart on a 12—

location circle, 6 ways to locate them 6 apart, and 4 ways to
locate 3 concentrations 4 apart. Thus even this example seems to
have 12+6+4=22 stable locational equilibria.

And yet in some sense the model's results are not as
arbitrary as one might suppose. For these parameters, one always
gets 2 or on rare occasions 3 concentrations, never more or less.

And the concentrations are always at least roughly evenly spaced.

This suggests that there is a sort of natural distance between
manufacturing concentrations that the model is "trying" to produce,

within the limits of what the initial conditions allow.

It would certainly be desirable to understand vhy the model

has a tendency to produce some particular spacing between
concentrations. Not only would it help us understand this model,

but it would raise hopes that economic geography will yield more

definite results than we might otherwise fear.

Models with

agglomeration economies typically have many equilibria, and one
therefore worries whether all that theory will tell us is that lots

of things could happen —— a result that would make the theory
untestable as well as useless. But the numerical examples suggest

that there may be a tendency to some kind of approximate
regularity, which will be a testable and useful prediction even if

we do not know precisely which equilibrium will emerge.
But isn't this a lot to be resting on a small Set Of numerical
examples? Indeed it is, and we might want to try a much broader set

of examples before being sure of our generalizations, or,

3. Fluctuations and aaalomeration: some intuition

Before proceeding to the formal analysis, it will be useful to

try to get some intuition about the story we are about to tell.
Imagine,

then,

narrow"

long that we may treat its length as infinite (that is, ignore edge

effects) and sufficiently narrow that we may treat it as one-

dimensional.

We

first ask the following question: how does an increase in

the amount of manufacturing at one location, say z, affect the real

wage of workers at another location x?
This is not an easy question to answer rigorously, because of
the

general

equilibrium

effects: a geographical redistribution of

manufacturing will in general change wage rates

at all

locations.

But we can think loosely in terms of partial effects. At given wage

rates, an increase in the concentration of manufacturing at z will

have three effects on workers at x. First, it will enlarge their

II

market, since they Can sell to z

second, it will improve the

supply of goods, since workers at X will buy goods from z; but
finally, it will increase the competition that workers at x face in
other markets.
Do the positive effects (which we can think of as backward and

forward linkages, respectively) prevail over the negative? The
answer depends on how far Z is from x. Roughly, we can think of the

typical market in which Z competes with x as being halfway between
the two locations. If z and x are very close, then the market that

z provides is essentially as close to, and therefore as important

to x as the market in which z competes with x. In this case the

linkages outweigh the competitive effect. But if Z is very far
away, it is also much further away than the typical market in which

x and z compete. Both the linkages and the competitive effect will

be weak, but the linkages will be weaker (since the relevant
distance is twice as large) .

As

a result, a thickening of the

distribution at a distant Z is likely to reduce real wages at X.
We can think, then, of some critical distance that defines the

range of positive

agglomeration

economies. An

increase

in

manufacturing at any point raises the real wages of workers within
that range, while depressing the real wages of workers beyond it.
Now let us take the crucial step. Let us suppose for a moment

that the divergence of manufacturing from a completely flat
distribution is not erratic, but instead takes the form of a
periodic function —— indeed,

let it be a sine curve. And let us ask

what is likely to happen to this divergence over time.

12

Suppose that we look at a peak of this divergence. Will this

peak be marked by real wages that are above average, roughly
average, or below average? The answer depends on the distribution

of manufacturing
manufacturing

around this

near the peak,

peak.

High concentrations

of

within the range of positive

agglomeration economies, raise the peak's real wage: below—average

concentrations within that range lower it. Outside the range of

positive agglomeration, things are reversed: low manufacturing
concentrations raise the peak's real wage, high concentrations
reduce it.

What this implies is that the real wage at the peak will
depend on the freauencv (or wavelength) of the distribution.
Suppose that the wavelength is very small relative to the range of

positive agglomeration, as in Figure 2. Then within that range
there will be about as many troughs as peaks, roughly cancelling

each other out: the real wage at the central peak will be just
about average.

On the other hand,

suppose that the wavelength of the

distribution of manufacturing is very long compared with the range

of positive agglomeration, as in Figure 3. Then much of the "high

ground" surrounding our peak will lie on the wrong side of the
range of agglomeration, exerting a negative effect on the real wage

there. The real wage at the peak may well actually be below
average.

The real wage at the peak is most likely to be high when the
wavelength of the manufacturing distribution is approximately equal

13

to the range of agglomeration, as in Figure 4. In this case all of

the nearby deviations from flat manufacturing distribution work to

reinforce the high real wage at the peak: the high ground lies
inside the range of positive agglomeration, the low ground outside
(where it also therefore makes a positive contribution).

Now let us consider what will happen to the the jp1jtude of
these fluctuations over time. In the case illustrated in Figure 2,
where the wavelength of the fluctuation is very short compared with

the range of agglomeration, peaks and troughs in the manufacturing

distribution will offer real wages that are little different from

the average. Thus there will be no particular tendency for the
fluctuations to change over time.
In the case illustrated in Figure 3, where the wavelength of

the distribution
agglomeration,

is very long compared with the range of

peaks will tend to have below—average real wages,

troughs above—average. In this case, then, peaks and troughs will
tend to shrink over time: the fluctuations will die out.
In the central case, however, peaks will offer clearly above-

average real wages, troughs below—average;

thus workers will

migrate away from troughs and toward peaks,

amplifying the

fluctuation over time.

All of this reasoning depends, of course, on the assumption
that manufacturing is distributed across space in a regular sine

wave. What relevance can it have to a situation in which the
distribution of manufacturing is not so regular? The answer is that

irreaul r adistribution of n aufacturina Can he decoppsed into

14

a Sum Of sine waves of different recniencies and amplitudes. And of

these regular fluctuations, those with very long wavelengths will
die out over time, those with very short wavelengths will grow only

slowly, while those with more or less the right wavelength will
grow

rapidly. In

particular,

there

some

wavelength

(corresponding to the range of positive agglomeration) that will

cannot, of course, go on forever. For one thing,

we will see in the next section that the reasoning here is only
strictly valid as long as we are able to represent the economy by
a linear approxiniation around a flat distribution of manufacturing.

As the fluctuations grow, this linear approxiniation will break
down. Above all, at some point there will be no manufacturing left

in some locations; at that point the smooth curves of the
fluctuations will start gathering themselves into the spikes of

and these peak concentrations will then gather

themselves into cities.

A final point: notice that in this model, instability is the

source of self—organization. The economy organizes itself into a

spatial structure of cities and rural areas precisely because a

15

flat, unorganized spatial structure is unstable; the intervals at

which cities

are located are determined by the particular

wavelength of fluctuation for which the flat structure is most
unstable.

This is about as far as we can go in an intuitive discussion.

Let us now turn to a formal treatment.

4. Dynamics near a flat spatial structure

For the formal analysis, we will consider a version of the
basic model presented in part 1 in which farmers are distributed
evenly along a line of infinite extent. Workers will also, at any
point in time, be distributed along that line; we let A(x) be the

density of workers at position X, normalized SO that with a flat
distribution k=i everywhere.

For this economy, equations (6)—(9) may be rewritten in the

following form (the constant terms are added so that when the
distribution is flat, Y(x) = w(x)

These are a fairly nasty—looking set of nonlinear equations.

Suppose, however, that we restrict our attention to situations in

approximations to the equations. Let a prima on a variable

(17)

These equations do not, at first sight, appear any more
tnctable than the nonlinear version. But now let us, following the
suggestion of part 3, assume for a moment that the distribution of

manufacturing follows a simple periodic distribution, say

17

= âcos(4x)

Now

(18)

let us simply guess that if the divergence of A(x) from

1 follows this simple periodic form, the divergences of all of the

other variables from 1 will be.constant multiples of A(x). (This
conclusion is actually obvious from the spatial symmetry and the
linearity). That is, we guess that there is a solution of the form

If this is a valid solution, then we have managed to reduce a

general equilibrium problem that

is,

strictly speaking,

the

solution of an infinite number of nonlinear equations to the
solution of four linear equations.
Let us, then, substitute (L8) into (19)—(22). When we do so,

we will see repeatedly a term of the form

H represents a sort of

discount factor —— the

ratio of the

impact of a fluctuation to what would happen if there was a uniform

increase in the same variable that raised the level at x by the
same amount. Thus in the equation for the true price index we know

that an equal increase in all wage rates would raise the price
index at x by an amount equal
x;

to

the increase in the wage rate at

fluctuation.

It is immediately obvious that for for very high

frequencies,

H approaches zero, while for low frequencies it

approaches 1.

We can now write our equations as

These equations can be solved to yield the crucial result that

Why is this the crucial result? Because the linearized version
of the dynamic equation

(5)

is

=

gA'(x)

(31)

where g is the rate of growth of a fluctuation at that frequency.
Now we note that a perturbation of the

spatial distribution of

manufacturing around A=1 can be represented as the sum of a number
of

sine waves

of different wavelengths:

And the growth of the perturbation may be written

so that we can think of each periodic fluctuation as growing at its

20

own characteristic rate. The fluctuation that will grow fastest is
the one with the largest (positive) response of the real wage rate

to manufacturing concentration: and given sufficient time that
fluctuation will dominate the spatial pattern.
So all we have to do to determine the preferred wavelength is

It says, in effect, that economies of scale are not

so large that workers would prefer all to be concentrated in the
same place no matter how high transportation costs are. Given this
condition, we find that very low frequency fluctuations, those with

very long wavelengths, tend to die out.
Finally, at H=O we find

(36

Taken together, these observations imply that the relationship

between the growth rate of a fluctuation and H has the shape
indicated in Figure 5. Growth is slow at very short wavelengths,
negative at high wavelengths, and most rapid at some intermediate
wavelength.

The preferred wavelength, the wavelength of most rapid
divergence, is a function of the three parameters ,

transport cost r enters the solution in only one place,

The

definition of H in (25). It is thus obvious that the preferred

frequency is strictly proportional to

r, and thus that the

preferred wavelength is inversely proportional. This is obvious
with hindsight, since the wavelength and the transportation cost
can both be changed in the same proportion by redefining the unit
of distance, with no real change in the model.

It is more painful to derive the impact of changes in the
elasticity of substitution and the share of manufacturing. It is,
however,

straightforward

to calculate the preferred frequency

numerically for given JA and a. This is shown in Table 1; we see

that higher elasticities

of substitution,

which imply lower

equilibrium economies of scale, tend to reduce the preferred
wavelength, while a higher manufacturing share tends to increase
the preferred wavelength.

Interesting models of the emergence of structure in a spatial

economy generally involve a tug of war between centripetal forces

that tend to produce agglomerations and centrifugal forces that

tend to pull them apart.

I have suggested that the origins of order may
