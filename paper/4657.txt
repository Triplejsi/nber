A TEST OF ThE INTERNATIONAL
CAPM USING BUSINESS CYCLES
INDICATORS AS INSTRUMENTAL
VARIABLES

ABSTRACT
Previous work by Dumas and Solnik (1993) has shown that a CAPM which incorporates

foreign-exchange risk premia (a so-called "international CAPM") is better capable empirically

of explaining the structure of worldwide rates of return than does the classic CAPM. In the
specification of that test, moments of rates of return were allowed to vary over time in relation
to a number of lagged "instrumental variables". Dumas and Solnik used instrumental variables
which were endogenous or Internal" to the financial market (lagged world market portfolio rate

of return, dividend yield, bond yield, short-term rate of interest). In the present paper, I use as

insmiments economic variables which are "external" to the financial market, such as leading
indicators of the business cycles. This is an attempt to explain the behavior of the international
stock market on the basis of economically meaningful variables which capture "the state of the
economy'1. I find that the leading indicators put together by Stock and Watson (NBER working

paper no. 4014, 1992) as predictors of the U.S. business cycle also predict stock returns in the
U.S.. Germany. Japan and the United Kingdom. These instruments lead again to a rejection of
the classic CAPM and no rejection of the international CAPM.

It may, however, also be true that external" variables can serve to
explain asset returns. Faaa and French (1989) show that much of the movement
in "internal" variables is related to business conditions; for instance, the
term structure spread peaks during recessions. Kandel and Stambaugh (1989)
show that expected returns peak at the end of a recession and Harvey (l991b)

shows that the ratio of conditional mean return to variance is
countercyclical. We show below that a particular set of leading indicators

(which does not include asset prices) predicts the stock markets of four
economically developed countries with an in-sample

which is comparable (and

in some cases superior) to that of "internal" variables.
From a theoretical stan'!;c!nt, it should be clear that any intertemporal

General-equilibrium model, such as the models of domestic or international
business cycles that have appeared recently,3 would generate asset prices
that would be functions of the stats variables of the economy. In these

models, the conditional expected values of rates of return would be functions
of state variables as well. Assuming that the mapping from state variables to
asset prices is invertible1 conditional expected returns must be functions of
asset prices. This explains why the stock market predicts itself; a large
enough number of asset prices can serve as proxy variables for the state
variables,

In the course of this substitution, however, the model has lost some of its

rate on 6-month U.S. Treasury bills, (iii) the spread between the yield on a
constant-maturity portfolie of 10-year U.S. T-bonds and the yield on 1-year

empirical, content since the link to the underlying physical. economy has been

severed. Even if one found that stock returns are related to stock prices in
the theoretical way, that would still leave open the question of the
contemporaneous relationship of this perfectly working stock market to the
economy. Does the stock market wove of its own accord or does it remain in
line with the conditions of physical production? More is achieved when

underlying state variables are identified and expected returns are related to
them, than when expected returns are related to asset prices. This paper is a

preliminary investigation into the nature of "the state of the economy", as
revealed by the behavior of asset returns.

Capital Asset Pricing models can serve as a tool, or sift, in the
identification of state variables. First, one finds variables that can serve
to condition returns (i.e., that have some power to predict rates of return).
Second, one verifies whether the conditional distribution satisfies some asset

pricing restrictions. For instance, can the first moments of returns be made
to match time-varying risk prersia built on second moments, as the conditional

form of the classic CAPH would suggest they should? If not, either the model

is incorrect or the variables have been improperly chosen. The search for the
relevant state variables, which will account for the time variability of asset
returns, is also a search for the relevant model specification.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 is a short reminder of the
"pricing kernel" or marginal-rate-of-substitution approach to CAPM tests.

Section 2 explores the behavior of worldwide asset returns on the basis of
U.S. instrumental variables. Section 3 does the same thing on the basis of
country-specific

instrumental variables. Section 4 concludes.

was initiated by Gallant and Tauchen (1989) and Hansen and .Jagannathan (1991).

Solnik (1993) to test CAPMs.

By contrast, the classic CAIN ignores investor diversity and assumes1 in

the residents of the reference currency country. Hence, no exchange-risk
hedging premium appears. In the above notations, the restriction of the

In this subsection, we state two auxiliary assumptions that are needed for
econometric

purposes. They are identical to the auxiliary assumptions used in

is a row vector of A predetermined instrumental variables which reflect
everything that is known to the investor. One goal of this paper is to
identify the list of Z variables. Assumption 1 is a strong assumption which
does not simply limit the information set of the econometrician; it limits the
information set of the investors and, therefore, their strategy space.

Next, we specify the way in which the market prices, A, move over time. We
assume that the variables, Z, can serve as proxies for the state variables

and that there exists an exact linear relationship between the As and the U:

with u satisfying (3). Equation (8) serves to define u from now on.

1.3. Data
We consider the monthly excess return on equity and currency holdings
measured in a common currency, the U.S. dollar. The excess return on an equity
market is the return on that market (cum dividend) translated into dollars,

minus the dollar one-month nominally risk-free rate. The return on a currency
holding is the one-month interest rate4 of that currency compounded by the
exchange rate variation relative to the U.S. dollar, minus the dollar one-

month risk-free rate.
In this study, we take four countries into account: Germany. the United

Kingdom, Japan and the United States. More precisely, we consider eight assets
in addition to the U.S. dollar deposit: the equity index of each country,5 a
Deutschemark deposit, a Pound Sterling deposit, a Yen deposit and the world
index of equities. In the CAflI, we include only three exchange risk premia - -

as many as we have exchange rates in the data set.
Available index level data cover the period January 1970 to December 1991

which is a 264 data point series. However, we work with rates of return and in
earlier work we needed to lag the rate of return on the world index by one

month in the instrumental-variable set; that left 262 observations spanning
March 1970 to December 1991. For the sake of comparability, we use here the
same

time

series of returns.

As we consider below various instrument sets, preliminary statistics will
be provided concerning rates of return and their predictability.

instrumental

variables

We first investigate a set of instruments common to all securities. We choose
United States business cycle variables as a common set. In the next section,
we explore country-specific variables. The choice of U.S. variables as a
common set is Justified by Figure 1 which plots coincident indicators of the

It wakes it plain that in most upturns and downturns the U.S. economy has
lead the two European economies of our sample. Japan has had at the most two
downturns s.nce the war; the United States has undergone downturns at about
the same time. That the U.S. lead other economies is confirmed by Figure 2
which shows the crosscorrelogram of coincident indicators between the U.S. and
other countries.7 Figure 2 reveals that U.S. lead Japan and Germany by at
least twelve months and more strongly lead the U.K. with a lead time of four

months approximately. That fact also explains Harvey's (l99la) finding that

U.S. stock market intenial variables are at least as good predictors of
worldwide rates of return as are country-specific, internal variables.
Below, we consider two sets of U.S. economic indicators: the Main Economic
Indicators of the OECD and the component indicators specifically selected by

Stock and Watson (1992) to lead the U.S. cycles and predict recessions. Each
time we consider a set of instrumental variables, predictability of returns is

assessed

by OLS and conformity with the international and classic CAPMs is

assessed by means

commercial bank loans (WAN), (vi) the U.S. money supply 143 (noted 143). All of

these were selected as being presumably "forward looking variables". Series
(iv) is stationary naturally. Other series were included in their first

difference form. Even though it is properly classified as an "internaP
variable, the lagged rate of return on the world market portfolio was added as
an instrument in an attempt to capture potential lagged impacts of instruments
on returns.

table I contains some descriptive statistics on rates of return,
instrumental variables and their ability to predict rates of return. I

summarize in Table 2 the R2s that have been achieved by Main Economic
Indicators (column 2) and, for purposes of comparison the R2s that had been
achieved by Dumas and Solnik (1593) by means of "internal" variables (column
1). It is observed that the predictive power of the Main Economic Indicators
is generally lower than was that of the "internal" financial

variables. One

variable has a consistent ability in predicting rates of return worldwide: the
increase in U.S. inventories in manufacturing industries1 with a positive
increase of that variable being followed by lower returns.

8Business cycle experts know that unemployment lags the cycle. The use of
this variable was not a good idea but I refrained from making any changes to
my original list for fear of accusations of data mining.
9The coefficient of this predictor will be found to be insignificant.
11

Using these variables as instruments, I proceed to estimate the
international and the classic CAPMs. The results appear in Tables 3 and 4
respectively.

The international CAPM yields a p-value of 0.0144 and is

rejected. The classic

is also rejected.
It is not clear whether it is legitimate to test a hypothesis when the
CAPM

produces a p-value of 0.0064

and

unrestricted model (in this case the international CAPK) is itself rejected. A
Newey-West test does not reject the hypothesis that exchange rate risk

receives a zero price (j —

0. i —

(see Table 5, pvalue — 0.086).

variables (without lags) also predict U.S. and other stock returns about as

markets whereas some economic variables are released several weeks after the

end of the month. In the statistical analysis we have simply used the data

pertaining to month t-l to predict rates of return over the month
(t-L, t). That procedure is not congruent with actual release dates. However,

the variable that is most effective in bringing about predictive performance
is vendor performance IVPAC. IVPAC

is released by the National Association of

Purchasing Managers a mere two days after the end of the month.

Even if economic data are released with some delay by statistical agencies

Furthermore, financial market prices and flows of goods and services act
as aggregators of information faster than do statistical agencies. My goal in

their predictive ability to internal, financial variables. I use them because

identifying the relevant economic variables.

The reader may nonetheless wish to know how the results would have been
affected by a different assumption on the timing of releases. In order to
provide that information to hi., I have shown in Table 2 the levels of R2s

attained when the Stock and Watson variables are delayed further by one and
also two months. Not surprisingly, the predictive performance for stock
returns deteriorates gradually.15 The predictive performance for currencies,
which was poor in the first place, is not markedly affected.

The fact that a leading index shows poor forecasting performance for stock
returns does not preclude the component series of the index from faring many
times better. For instance, the Stock and Watson XL12 index predicts returns
very poorly but we reported in Subsection 2.2 that its components provide the

best forecasting basis that we have found so far. This remark applies even

their large number, these instruments cannot be used to test CAPMs by GM.

Instruments ought to be selected in each country for the purpose of
predicting increments in business cycle coincident indicators. This would be a
17

replication of the Stock and

Watson procedure with worldwide data. Then, the

selected instruments could be investigated for the ability to forecast
securities returns. This will be left for future research.

4. Conclusion
This preliminary investigation was meant to highlight the links that exist
between predicted activity levels and conditionally expected stock returns.
The following conclusions emerge from it:
i. The nonfinancial leading indicators selected by Stock and Watson (1992)
for the purpose of predicting United States business cycles seem to offer also
50DB potential for the prediction of worldwide stook returns. Outstanding

contributions to predictive power were made by the variables IVPAC (Vendor
Performance) and HSEP (Housing authorizations). Furthermore, the signs of
these variables' coefficients made intuitive sense. IVPAC is an especially
valuable predictor since its value is released a mere 48 hours after the end
of the month.

ii. Using the Stock and Watson instrument set, the international, conditional
CAPM was marginally not rejected while the classic, conditional CAlM was
rejected.

iii. Other sets of instrumental variables that I have tried so far (U.S. Main

Economic Indicators. dECK country leading indexes) have not proven as
successful both in regard to their power of prediètion and in regard to their
ability to discriminate between asset pricing models.

Other, more subtle clues could be gathered from the data and could point
the way toward future research. The first issue that I would like to raise
concerns the link between predictability of returns and the power of asset

18

pricing tests. The OECD Main Economic Indicators (MEI5), as used here, have
lower predictive power than did the Stock Watson leading series, while these
series in turn had a lower predictive ability than did the "internal?

variables used by Dumas and Solnik and others (see Table 2). In tests of asset
prices, the MEts rejected both th, classic and the international models, while
the Stock-Watson variables rejected one model and marginally did not reject
the other. In Dumas and Solnik (1993). the discrimination between the two
asset pricing models was much sharper (the classic caPM was rejected while the
international one had a p-value of 221). As we improve the degree of
predictability, should we expect better discrimination between models? Since
our goal is not to predict but to identify state variables of the economy and
to determine which asset pricing model is correct, how much importance should
we give to the predictive power (the R2) of the instruments?
The second issue concerns the choice of instrumental variables. In this
respect, it is important to avoid the pitfalls of data mining. That is the
reason why I never modified my list of MEl indicators and why I chose to work
with the Stock and Watson variables which have been preselected to predict
activity and not to predict stock returns. This defense against accusations of
data inning is all the stronger as the correlations between stock returns and
activities levels are small (see footnote 14). As we attempt to predict
worldwide stock returns, should we be content to use U.S. variables, such as
those of Stock and Watson, on the grounds that the U.S. business cycle seems
to lead other cycles? Or can we hope to attain greater predictibility by
using country-specific indicator variables? If so, should these variables be
selected on the basis of their ability to predict local levels of activity?
A third issue that will deserve more scrutiny is the influence of time

19

lags. Time lags are both of economic and statistical significance.
Economically speaking, only innovation in a data series is capable of
constituting news. News are the primary moving force behind realized returns.
it is not clear, however, to what extent the past information and the lag
structure that were identified as giving the best prediction of activity
levels

should also be relevant as determinants of conditionally expected

returns.

We

did observe here (footnote 13) that

the

use of the Stock and

Watson lags did not improve the predictability of returns.

Finally, from the point of view of the statistical specification, Thierry
lJizman will point out in his discussion that the levels, the first differences
of

indicator variables and their first differences at different lags do not

convey

the same

information concerning the

stage of the business cycle the

economy is in and do not have the same power to predict returns. How does one
determine which specification is preferable for our purposes?
