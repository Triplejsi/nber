SOURCES OF REAL EXCHANGE RATE
FLUCTUATIONS: HOW IMPORTANT
ARE NOMINAL SHOCKS?

ABSTRACT
This paper investigates empirically and attempts to identify the sources of real exchange

rate fluctuations since the collapse of Bretton Woods. The paper's first two sections survey and

extend earlier, non-structural empirical work on this subject by Campbell and Clarida (1987),
Meese and Rogoff (1988), and Cumby and Huizinga (1990). The paper's main contribution is
to build and estimate a three equation open macro model in the spirit of Dornbusch (1976) and

Obstfeld (1985) and to identify the model's structural shocks - to demand, supply, and money using the approach pioneered by Blanchard and Quah (1989). For two of the four countries we

study, Germany and Japan, our structural estimates imply that monetary shocks, to money supply

as well as to the demand for real money balances, explain a substantial amount of the variance
of real exchange rates relative to the dollar. We find that demand shocks, to national saving and
investment, explain the majority of the variance in real exchange rate fluctuations, while supply

shocks explain very little. The model's estimated short run dynamics are strikingly consistent
with the predictions of the simple textbook Mundell-Fleming model.

SOURCES OF REAL EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS:
HOW IMPORTANT ARE NOMINAL SHOCKS?

Introduction
This paper investigates and attempts to identify the sources of real

exchange rate fluctuations since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system

of fixed exchange rates in the early 1970s.

In an influential paper,

Mussa (1986) argued that sluggish price adjustment must play a central
role in explaining the short run movements in real and nominal exchange

rates. He based this conclusion on the indisputable fact that the
volatility of real exchange rates since the collapse of Bretton Woods has

closely tracked the volatility of nominal exchange rates, and that the
variance of real exchange rates since the collapse of fixed exchange rates

has been 8 to 80 times higher than during Bretton Woods.

Stockinan (1987) pointed out that, according to the equilibrium
approach to exchange rates developed in his and other papers, the behavior

of real exchange rates since the collapse of Bretton Woods could reflect

not the importance of sluggish price level adjustment, but rather the
influence of real shocks with large permanent components. The empirical
findings that, since the collapse of Bretton Woods, real exchange rates
appear to possess a unit root and that most of the variance of changes in

real exchange rates is attributed to permanent shocks (Huizinga (1987)),

and that little of the variance of real exchange rate changes can be
accounted for by real interest rate differentials (Campbell and Clarida

(1987); Meese and Rogoff (1988)) have, taken together, tended to cast

1

doubt on the relevance of the basic "sticky price" open macro model
(Dornbusch (1976)) for explaining real exchange rates. Meese and Rogoff
(1988) conclude:

Our evidence provides no support whatsoever for the view that
a model [that emphasizes the interaction of sticky prices and

monetary disturbances] can explain the major swings in the
real exchange rate. The strongest prediction of those models
-

that

real interest differentials will be highly correlated

with real exchange rate movements -

simply does

not appear in

the data. (Meese and Rogoff (1988), p. 940)

Any model of the real exchange rate that incorporates monetary
neutrality in the long run implies that the level of the real exchange
rate, at least in the long run, is invariant to shocks in money supply and
the demand for real money balances.

It follows that, if money is to have

an influence on real exchange rates, the influence must be felt in the

short run.

Empirically, this means that an upper bound on the

contribution of monetary shocks to the variance of real exchange rate
changes is given by the variance of the change in the transitory component

in real exchange rates. This is an upper bound because real shocks to
national absorption, fiscal shocks, and supply, productivity shocks can
also have transitory effects on the real exchange rate.
In the next section of this paper, we revisit the real interest rate
-

real

exchange rate connection. We show how the approach introduced by

Campbell and C].arjda (1987) and Meese and Rogoff (1988) and studied
recently by Baxter (1992) can be generalized to allow for a much wider
class of stochastic processes for the real interest differential than is

2

required by these previous papers. Notwithstanding this generalization,

we find, as did Campbell and Clarida (1987) and Meese and Rogoff (1988)
that the transitory component in dollar real exchange rates implied by the

time series on real interest differentials accounts for only a trivial
fraction of the variance in the log change in real exchange rates.
In the paper's third section we estimate the transitory component in

real exchange rates using a multivariate version of the Beveridge-Nelson

(1981) decomposition. In addition to lagged real exchange rate changes,
the VAR information set used to forecast future real exchange rate changes

includes lagged inflation differentials and lagged changes in US output
relative to foreign output.

We include lagged inflation differentials in

the VAR because, as demonstrated by Cuxnby and Huizinga (1990), lagged
inflation helps to forecast subsequent changes in bilateral real exchange

rates. Lagged inflation differentials are also likely to be correlated
with nominal shocks in the US relative to the foreign country under study.
We include lagged log changes in the ratio of US to foreign output because

the evidence of a unit root in real exchange rates suggests that real
shocks -

to

supply as well as to demand for national outputs such as

fiscal shocks (Meltzer (1993)) - must play a role in understanding the

behavior of real exchange rates since 1973. While the Beveridge-Nelson
decompositions based upon these trivariate VARs are not structural, we
investigate and estimate later in the paper a structural open macro model

that employs these very VARs.
We find, as did Cuniby and Huizinga (1990) who computed Beveridge -

Nelson decompositions using a smaller system that included only the lagged
inflation differentials, that there is a substantial transitory component

3

in the dollar-DM and dollar-yen real exchange rates. In particular, we
show that the variance of the change in the BN transitory component is 70
percent of the variance of the change in the dollar-DM real exchange rate,

and 59 percent of the variance of the change in the dollar-yen real
exchange rate. We also show that lagged inflation differentials Granger
cause real exchange rate changes in these two countries. We contrast the

transitory component in real exchange rates recovered fro uiivariate BN
decomposition with the component recovered from our multivariate system.
In section four of the paper, we present a three equation open macro

model that can be used to interpret the trivariate VARs estimated in
section three of the paper. This model, which is a stochastic version of

the two country, rational expectations open macro model developed by
Obstfeld (1985), exhibits the standard Nundell-Fleming-Dornbusch results

in the "short run" when prices adjust sluggishly to money, supply, and

demand shocks, but it also embodies the "longer run" properties that
characterize macroeconomic equilibrium in the open economy once prices

adjust fully to all shocks.

Throughout this paper, we shall refer

interchangeably to "nominal" shocks and "monetary" shocks.

Our

theoretical model, and our empirical strategy, allows for shocks to
relative national money supplies and relative national demands for real
money balances. The combined impact of these disturbances is identified
as a monetary, or nominal, shock by our approach.

We employ the long run

that are shared with many other open

macro models including the cash-in-advance Arrow-Debreu models developed
by Lucas (1982) and others -

to

obtain restrictions that can be used to

identify three structural shocks that drive the system: shocks to "money",

4

shocks to "demand", and shocks to "supply". Identification is achieved
using the approach pioneered by Blanchard and Quah (1989), employed by
Shapiro and Watson (1988), Gali (1992), Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1992),
and critiqued by Evans and Reichlin (1993).

An important advantage of

the Blanchard-Quah approach to identification is that we do not have to

take a stand on the dynamics or the contemporaneous exclusion of any
structural shock from any particular equation. Rather, we use only the
longer run restrictions implied by our model - and many other open macro
models -

to

identify the structural dynamics from the data.

Section five presents the paper's key empirical results. For two of

the four countries we investigate, Japan and Germany, our structural VAR

estimates imply that nominal shocks explain a substantial amount of the
variance in dollar-DM and dollar-yen real exchange rates. In particular,

we find that more than 41 percent of the unconditional variance of the
change in the dollar-DM real exchange rate, and more than 35 percent of

the variance of the change in the dollar-yen real exchange rate are
attributed to nominal shocks. For the other two co.intries in our study,

Britain and Canada, there is much less evidence that nominal shocks are
important for real exchange rate fluctuations. We also devote extensive
efforts to determine whether or not the money, demand, and supply shocks
our empirical models recover "look like" such shocks are supposed to look.

We do this by decomposing the "real time" history of each real exchange

rate into the history of the implied monetary, demand, and supply
influences that, according to our estimates, generated the realized path
of the real exchange rate. We also generate impulse response functions to
the three structural shocks and compare those responses with those implied

5

by our versicr of the Mundell-Fleming-Obstfeld model presented in Section

four. One contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that in all four
countries, the short run dynamic responses of relative national outputs,

prices, and the real exchange rate to money and demand shocks are
consistent with the predictions of a stochastic, rational expectations
version of the textbook Mundell-Fleming model.
Section six of the paper compares our findings with those reported
recently in the literature and provides some concluding remarks.

Real Interest Rates and the Transitory Component in Real Exchange Rates

Over the past decade, a number of papers have exploited the
relationship between real interest differentials and real exchange rates

implied by interest parity to make inferences about the transitory
component embedded in real exchange rates (Frankel (1979;l985), Loopesko

and Shafer (1983), Sachs (1985), Campbell and Clarida (1987), Meese and

Rogoff (1988), Baxter (1992), and Edison and Pauls (1993)). Letting rr
denote the short term ex ante real interest differential in favor of the
home country:

(1)

rrt

(jh - Etlrht+i) -

Eirt+1);

uncovered interest parity implies:

(2)

rr —

Eq+1;

where q — St + p - ph is the log of the real exchange rate and E is the
linear projection operator. Equation (2) can be solved forward to obtain:

qrrt—-trrt+i,
j—O

where

is the difference between the current level of q, the real
—

exchange rate, and

the expected long run level of the real

exchange rate;

(4)

qrr —

Thus when q is negative and the dollar is transitorily overvalued
relative to the level of long run real exchange rate, the magnitude of

this overvaluation is given by the sum of ex ante real interest
7

differcrtia1s in favor of the dollar. The expected sum of ex ante real
interest differentials is unobservable. However, letting

we can use the law of iterated expectations to express qr

Projecting both sides of (5) on an informationion set x we obtain:

E(q) -=

The right hand side of (6) can be obtained by summing the forecasts
derived from an estimated VAR model for x that includes the ex post real
interest rate differential. According to (6), the estimate each period of

the sum of real interest differentials derived in this fashion is, in
population, equal to the projection of the transitory component of the

real exchange rate q on the information set x that would be obtained
under interest parity if q were in fact observable.

We estimate E(qJx), the transitory divergence between the real
exchange rate and the expected long run real exchange rate implied by
interest parity, using a bivariate VAR in
the sum

of

r] to forecast each period

real interest differentials. We use non-overlapping data on 3

month ex post real interest differentials and the 3 month log difference
in the real exchange rate for Germany, Japan, Canada, and Britain over the

floating exchange rate period 1973:3-1992:1. Since the interest rate data
for Japan begin in 1975:3, our estimates of q for Japan cover the period

8

1975:3 - 1992:1.

Both real interest differentials and the change in the

real exchange rate are constructed using CPI indexes of national price
levels. Each VAR contain sa constant and 4 lags of q and r.
Charts 1 through 4 present the results of this exercise. The center

panel of each chart depicts the time path of qrr implied by the interest
parity relationship (6) and the estimated bivariate VAR. The top panel in
each chart presents, using a solid line, the actual time path of the level

of the real exchange rate q and presents, using a broken line, the time
path of the estimated long run real exchange rate that

is

defined by (4)

and that can be recovered using the estimates of E(qrr{x).
Chart I presents the results for Germany. As can be seen from the
top panel of Chart 1, the floating rate years have been marked by three
period of substantial, sustained swings in the real value of the dollar

relative to the DM. In the first period, 1977 through 1979, the dollar
depreciated by 20 percent in real terms against the DM in tandem with an

acceleration in US inflation and a loss in confidence in US monetary
policy.

In the second period, 1980 through 1984, the real value of the

dollar appreciated by more than 50 percent against the DM.

This

appreciation occurred in conjunction with shift to a disinflationary US

monetary policy and change in the US fiscal stance that resulted in a
pronounced widening in the US budget deficit and a decline in national
saving. In the third period, 1985 through 1987, the dollar depreciated by

40 percent in real terms against the DM.

The center panel of Chart 1 presents the estimates of qrr, the
transitory over or under valuation of the dollar relative to its long run

level implied by the time series properties of ex post real interest

9

differentials and interest rate parity. The estimates of -qt implied by
real interest differentials suggests a modest degree of overshooting in

the dollar-DM real exchange rate in each of these three episodes.

particular, throughout the 1977 -

1979

In

period in which the dollar

depreciated by 20 percent against the DM in real terms, expected future
real interest differentials implied a 2 to 3 percent under valuation of
the real dollar-DM exchange rate - and thus the expectation of a 2 to 3
percent appreciation of the dollar. Of course, that expectation was more

than realized between 1980 and 1984 as the real value of the dollar

appreciated by 50 percent or more against the DM.

We note that

consistently throughout 1982, 1983, and 1984, the time series of expected
future real interest differentials implied that the dollar was overvalued

by 3 to 5 percent relative to the DM in real terms during this
appreciation and thus, that the dollar was expected ultimately to
depreciate and "give back" 3 to 5 percent of the huge real appreciation of

the early 1980s. Again, this expectation was more than realized between
1985 and 1987 when the real value of the dollar against the DM did in fact

real

depreciation, expected future real interest differentials implied a 3 to
4 percent under valuation of the real dollar-DM exchange rate throughout
1986 and 1987, suggesting some modest amount of overshooting in the real
dollar-DM exchange rate in the years following the Plaza Accord.
Chart 2 presents the results for Japan. As with Germany, we observe

in retrospect three period of substantial, sustained swings in the real
value of the dollar relative to the yen: a two year period, 1977 through

1978, of sustained dollar depreciation, followed by a six year period,

10

1919 through 1984, in which the real dollar-yen exchange rate appreciated
by 50 percent, followed by a three year interval in the which the exchange

rate depreciated by 50 percent against the yen in real terms.

The

estimates of qrr presented in the center panel of Chart 2 provide some
modest indication of overshooting in the 1977-1978 and 1985-1987 periods
of dollar-yen real depreciation, with the dollar estimated to be some 1 to

2 percent undervalued in 1977-1978 and 1985-1987. There is somewhat more

evidence of overshooting during the years 1981-1984 in which the dollar
was estimated to be 2 to 3 percent overvalued.
Chart 3 presents the UK results.

Again, three

intervals of substantial, sustained swings in the real value of the dollar

relative to sterling are evident in the data. However, the estimates of
qrr presented in the center panel of Chart 3 provide little indication

of overshooting in the 1977-1979 period of dollar-sterling real

depreciation or in the 1980-1984 period of dollar-sterling real
appreciation.

However, the estimates do suggest that the dollar did

overshoot by some 3 to 4 percent in 1986 and 1987.

Chart 4 presents the results for Canada.

In

contrast with the other three countries the dollar actually appreciated
against the Canadian dollar in real terms during 1977-1979, and continued

this appreciation throughout most of period 1980-1985. Consistently, the
time series of forecasted real interest differentials indicates that the

dollar was overvalued during this appreciation and was expected to
depreciate in real terms by some 2 to 3 percent. Beginning in 1986, the
dollar did in fact begin a sustained real depreciation, overshooting the
long run real exchange rate by some 3 percent.

11

The top panel of Table 1 reports the ratio of the sample variance of

qrr to the sample variance of

for each of the four real exchange

rates relative to the dollar. These results confirm impression conveyed
by Charts 1 to 4: little of the variance of real exchange rate changes can

be accounted for by changes in the expected sum of future real interest
differentials. These findings generalize, but support, the conclusions of

Campbell and Clarida (1987) and Meese and Rogoff (1988) who assumed that
the expected sum of future real interest differentials is proportional to

the current ex ante real interest differential q —

As can be seen in the table, ex post real interest differentials are
forecastable.

For all four countries, lagged ex post real interest

differentials help to forecast future real differentials and in two
countries, lagged changes in real exchange rates Grariger cause real
interest differentials. By contrast, Table 1 shows that changes in real

exchange rates are substantially less forecastable conditional on this
information set containing lagged real exchange rate changes and lagged
real interest differentials.

Moreover, in no country do lagged real

interest differentials Granger cause subsequent real exchange rate
changes.

see that:

Thus, the interest parity hypothesis that is used to estimate qt implies
a set of cross-equations on the VAR, namely, that coefficients in each VAR

projection equation be identical. The results obtained from testing these
restrictions for each country are presented in the lower panel of Table 1.

As can be seen from the table, in three of the four cases, these
restrictions on the VAR forecasting equation can be soundly rejected at
the 2 percent significance level. These restrictions cannot be rejected
for the dollar-yen system, but this appears to be due to the fact that the

real dollar-yen exchange rate is unforecastable in this bivariate system

so that imposing the interest parity restrictions does not lead to a
substantial deterioration of the log likelihood.

Of course, there are

scores of papers employing alternative, perhaps more powerful tests that

have investigated and rejected the uncovered interest parity hypothesis

The point we wish to make here is

(see Hodrick (1988) for a survey).

simply that, the interest parity restrictions that are relevant for

estimating the transitory component in real exchange rates from
observations on real interest differentials are apparently also violated
in the data.

To get a sense of the magnitude of the divergence between E(qJx)
and

x3, we plot in the bottom panel of Charts I - 4 the

latter series based upon the estimated bivariate VAR for each country. To

interpret these plots, we note that if interest parity held -

imposed the interest parity cross-equation restrictions when forecasting
real exchange rate changes and real interest differentials from the VARs -

the line that plots -E(qx) in the center panel and the line that plots

13

As is evident, this is far from the case. We conclude that, from the
perspective of recovering estimates of the transitory component in real
exchange rates, the departures from interest parity are substantial enough

to warrant the consideration of alternative approaches.

14

Multivariate Beveridge-Nelson Decompositions
While the results obtained by using forecasts of real interest rates

to make inferences about the behavior of the transitory component in the

real exchange rate are suggestive of some modest, persistent degree of
divergence between current and long run real exchange rates, the dominant

impression one derives from the Charts 1 - 4 is the extent to which the
time path of the long run real exchange rate mimics the time path of the

actual real exchange rate. Over the past 20 years of floating exchange
rates relative to the dollar, a number of authors (Roll (1979); Frenkel

(1981); Adler and Lehman (1983); Cuinby and Obstfeld (1985); GrilliKaminski(1991); Edison and Pauls (1993)) have presented empirical evidence

that indicates that real exchange rates relative to the dollar possess a
unit root. That is, real exchange rates are integrated of order 1, 1(1),
and are driven by permanent shocks.
A popular and intuitive way to decompose an 1(1) time series into a

permanent and a tuitory component is due to Beveridge and Nelson
(1981). A Beveridge - Nelson decomposition of the real exchange rate q
implies that the transitory departure of the real exchange rate from its
expected long run equilibrium is given by:

—

.)

The BN decomposition defines the permanent, or expected long run, real
exchange rate

(9)

BN

as:

q + EELiq+.
15

Combining (8) and (9) we see that q + BN q. Beveridge and Nelson
(1981) prove that

is a random walk, while q is stationary since q,

is 1(1).

Kuizinga (1987) employed the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition to
investigate the importance of the permanent component in real exchange
rates relative to the dollar since the 1973 advent of floating. Using the
history of changes in the real exchange rate itself as his information set

to estimate the Beveridge-Nelson transitory component defined by equation

(8), Huizinga found evidence that, while fluctuations in the permanent
component of the real exchange rate account for most of the volatility of

observed changes in real exchange rates, actual real exchange rates
relative to the dollar did appear to overshoot persistently and revert
rather gradually to the to the long run equilibrium real exchange rate
defined by the Beveridge-Nelson permanent component.

Huizinga's (1987) univariate decomposition of the real
exchange rate followed the lead of Beveridge and Nelson in their original
work.

Recently, several authors have uncovered some interesting

implications of multivariate generalizations of the Beveridge-Nelson
decomposition (Evans (1989), Cochrane (1990), and King, Plosser, Stock,
and Watson (1991), and Evans and Reichlin (1993)).

One finding, due to

Evans and Reichlin (1993), is that, if the inultivariate information set

includes variables that Granger cause subsequent changes in the real
exchange rate, the variance of the transitory component relative to the

Beveridge-Nelson permanent component derived from such a multivariate
system must strictly exceed the ratio of the transitory component to the
permanent component derived from a univariate information set.

16

In this section, we present the results of trivariate BeveridgeNelson decompositions of the log real exchange rate of the dollar relative
to the yen, DM, sterling, and the Canadian dollar based upon VAR forecasts

of the change in the real exchange rate. The information set includes not

only lagged changes in the log real exchange rate, but also lagged
inflation differentials between the US and the foreign country, ,r., and
lagged changes in the log ratio of US to foreign real GDP,

The data

are quarterly and span the floating exchange rate period 1973:3 -

1992:4.'

We include lagged inflation differentials in the information set because,

as demonstrated by Cumby and Huizinga (1990), lagged inflation helps to
forecast subsequent changes in bilateral real exchange rates. Cuinby and
Huizinga (1990) studied a bivariate Beveridge-Nelson decomposition of the

log real exchange in a system that included lagged inflation
differentials. The results of this section of our paper obviously build

on their work. We go beyond Cuinby and Huizinga (1990) by including a

"real" as well as a "nominal" variable in the information set, by
explicitly comparing the multivariate with the corresponding univariate
decompositions, and by demonstrating the importance of Granger causality

in accounting for the differences between the decompositions.

Lagged

inflation differentials are also likely to be correlated with nominal
shocks in the US relative to the foreign country under study. We include
lagged log changes in US to foreign output because the evidence of a unit
root in real exchange rates, in conjunction with the theoretical model we

derive below, suggests that real shocks -

to

the supply as well as to

demand for national outputs - must play a role in understanding the
behavior of real exchange rates since 1973 (Campbell and Clarida (1987);

17

Stockman (1987)). While the everidge-Nelson decompositions based upon
these trivariate VARs are not structural, we investigate and estimate
later in the paper a structural open macro model that employs these very
VARs.

Charts 5 through 8 present the results of these decompositions. The
bottom panel in each chart depicts, using a solid line, the time path of -

qBN which may be interpreted as magnitude of the over or under valuation

of the real dollar exchange rate relative to

the

Beveridge-Nelson

permanent component. The bottom panel in each chart also depicts, using
a dashed line, the time path of

the over or under valuation of the

dollar real exchange rate obtained from a univariate Beveridge-Nelson
decomposition. The top panel in each chart presents, using a solid line,

the actual time path of the level of the real exchange rate q and
presents, using a dashed line, the time path of the estimated long run
real exchange BN derived from the trivariate system.
As can be seen in the bottom panel of Chart 5, the estimates of qBN
based upon the trivariate Beveridge-Nelson decomposition reveal sustained

periods of substantial overshooting in the dollar-DM real exchange rate.

In particular, throughout the 1978 -

1979

period of real dollar

depreciation against the DM, the dollar was undervalued by some 20 to 30

percent relative to the long run real exchange rate defined by .

By

contrast, throughout the years 1983, 1984, and 1985 of "benign neglect"

during which the dollar surged, the real value of the dollar was
consistently overvalued by 10 to 14 percent, implying the expectation that
10 to 14 percent of the dollar's real appreciation during the early 1980s

would be given back through eventual real depreciation. (CHART 5 HERE)

18

The contrast between the time series q and q4hJ for the dollar-DM
real exchange rate is striking for two reasons.

First, the transitory

component in the real exchange rate implied by the multivariate
decomposition is substantially larger and more volatile than is transitory

component implied by the univariate decomposition, a fact evident from

Chart 5 that we shall quantify shortly. Second, q is persistently of
the opposite sign to

This means that, regardless of the differences

in magnitude, in periods such 1977 - 1979 when the dollar was depreciating

and in which the trivariate Beveridge-Nelson decomposition implies that
the dollar was undervalued and expected to appreciate in real terms, the

univariate decomposition implies that the dollar was overvalued and
expected to depreciate further. Moreover, in periods such 1982 - 1985
when the dollar was appreciating and in which the trivariate BeveridgeNelson decomposition implies that the dollar was overvalued and expected

to depreciate in real terms, q' implies that the dollar was undervalued
and expected to appreciate further. Evans and Reichlin (1993) document a

similar difference between univariate and multivariate Beveridge-Nelson
decompositions of US real GD?.

They demonstrate that cov(&j,q) — -

Thus the sign of the covariance between the change in
the real exchange rate and the level of the Beveridge-Nelson transitory

component depends upon the autocovariance of

Evans and Reichlin

(1993) conclude that the contrast between the univariate and multivariate

estimates of the transitory component depends upon differences in

estimating the autocovariance using a univariate as opposed to a
multivariate information set.

19

Chart 6 presents the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition results for the

dollar-yen real exchange rate. Again, the estimates of q based upon the

trivariate Beveridge-Nelson decomposition reveal sustained periods of
substantial overshooting in the dollar-yen real exchange rate, both in
absolute terms and in comparison with the estimates for

We note

that in 1976 and 1977, qBN indicated that the dollar was substantially
overvalued relative to the yen and was expected ultimately to depreciate
by some 30 percent in real terms against the yen. A real depreciation of
this magnitude did in fact occur in 1978 and 1979. Indeed, the Beveridge-

Nelson decomposition indicated that the real value of the dollar
depreciated beyond its expected long run level sometime in early 1979, and

was thereafter undervalued throughout the rest of 1979, 1980 and 1981,
years in which the dollar actually did appreciate in real terms against
the yen.

Overshooting is also evident during the later years, 1982 -

1985, of the dollar's Reagan-Voicker appreciation.
Charts 7 and 8 present the real exchange rate decomposition results

for the US-UK and the US-Canada.

These

decompositions differ both qualitatively and quantitatively from those
just presented for the US and Germany and the US and Japan. As is evident

from Charts 7 and 8, and as will be confirmed shortly, relative to the
dollar, ieal sterling and Canadian dollar exchange rates appear to possess

rather small, and not particularly persistent, transitory components. In
other words, conditional on the trivariate information set studied in this

section, very little of the change in either the dollar-sterling or the
dollar-Canadian dollar real exchange rate is forecastable. Moreover, for
these two real exchange rates relative to the dollar, the behavior of the

20

transitory components derived from the trivariate systems does not differ

substantially from the transitory component implied by the univariate
decompositions.

the variance of the change in the Beveridge-Nelson transitory component in

the real exchange rate to the variance of the actual change in the real
exchange rate.
conveyed by Charts 5 -

These results confirm the impressions

8. Based upon the Beveridge-Nelson decompositions

derived from the trivariate systems, the variance of the change in the
transitory component of the dollar-DM and dollar-yen real exchange rates

is estimated to account for a quite substantial fraction of the actual
change in these real exchange rates. Whether or not one views this as a

"substantial" transitory component depends of course on one's priors.
Until the mid 1980s, there was something of a consensus among researchers

that most movements in real exchange rates represented transitory
fluctuations around a slowly changing, if not constant, equilibrium real
exchange rate. Since the papers by Campbell and Clarida (1987), Huizinga
(1987), Stockman (1987), Meese and Rogoff (1988), and Crilli and Kaminski

(1991), the weight of the evidence suggests that most movements in real

exchange rates represent permanent shifts in real exchange rates.
However, Grillj and Kaminski (1991) point out that real exchange rate

"facts" can be quite regime specific, and that post-1973 empirical
regularities, including the importance of permanent shocks, may not
generalize to other floating exchange rate periods.

By contrast,

transitory predictable changes in the real dollar-sterling and Canadian
dollar exchange rates appear, based upon the sample variances, to be much

21

less important in accounting for changes in these real exchange rates.
The top panel of Table 2 also reinforces the point, evident in the Charts,

that the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition of the real exchange rate into
permanent and transitory components depends upon the information set. For

the dollar-DM and the dollar-yen real exchange rates, the ratio of the
variance of the transitory component to the change in the real exchange
rate based upon the trivariate VAR is four times larger than is the ratio

based upon a univariate autoregressive model for real exchange rate
changes. For the dollar-sterling and especially the US-Canadian dollar
real exchange rates, there is much less differences between the variance
ratios calculated from the univariate and multivariate information sets.
The bottom panel of Table 2 presents some summary statistics for the

estimated trivariate VARs. For the dollar-DM and dollar-yen real exchange
rates, we see that lagged inflation differentials Granger cause subsequent
real exchange rate changes. Cumby and Huizinga (1990) document that lagged

inflation differentials help to forecast real exchange rate changes, but

they do not report on Granger causality. Evans and Lothian (1993) do

document Granger causality from lagged inflation, but not inflation
differentials, to real exchange rate changes. For the dollar-sterling and

Canadian dollar real exchange rates, there is no evidence that lagged

inflation differentials, or for that matter lagged output growth
differentials, have incremental predictive content for subsequent real
exchange rate changes. These findings are relevant for interpreting Chart
5 - 8 and the variance ratios reported in the top panel of Table 2. As

mentioned earlier, if the multivariate information set includes variables

that Granger cause subsequent changes in the real exchange rate, the

22

variance of the Beveridge-Nelson transitory component relative to the
Beveridge-Nelson permanent component derived from such a multivariate
system must strictly exceed the ratio of the Beveridge-Nelson transitory
component to the permanent component derived from a univariate information

set. Thus, the finding of Granger causality for the dollar-DM and dollar-

yen systems, and the absence of Granger causality in the dollar-sterling
and Canadian dollar systems, can account for the differences in variance
ratios reported in Table 2.

A Stochastic Rational Expectations Open Macro Model

We now present a stochastic version of the two country, rational

expectations open macro model developed by Obstfeld (1985). The model
also draws on papers by Dornbusch (1976), Branson (1979), Flood (1981),
Mussa (1982), Buiter and Miller (1983), McCallum (1988), and Canzoneri and

The model not only exhibits the standard Mundell-

Henderson (1991).

Fleming-Dornbusch results in the "short-run" when prices adjust sluggishly
to demand, money, and supply shocks, but it also embodies the "longer-run"
properties that characterize macroeconomic equilibrium in the open economy

once prices adjust fully to all shocks.2 All variables except interest

rates are in logs and represent home relative to foreign levels. For
example,

Equation (10) is an open economy IS equation in which the demand for

home output relative to foreign output is increasing in the real exchange
rate and a relative demand shock d and is decreasing in the real interest

differential in favor of the home country.

We think of d as capturing

shocks to home absorption relative to foreign absorption such as fiscal

shocks. Equation (11) is a version of the price setting equations that
24

have been studied in open macro setting by Flood (1981), Mussa (1982), and

others. According to (11), the price level in period t is an average of

the market clearing price expected in t-l to prevail in t,1pe, and the
price that would actually clear the output market in period t, P°.

When

1, prices are fully flexible and output is supply determined. When 9

0, prices are fixed and predetermined 1 period in advance. Equation
(12) is a standard LM equation, while Equation (13) is a statement of
interest parity. In the sequel we shall let the variable m capture the
influence of shocks to relative national money supplies as well as shocks

to relative national demands for real money balances.
Before we solve the model, we need first to specify the stochastic

processes that govern the relative supply of output y, the relative
demand shock d, and relative money m. In general, we would expect output
supply, output demand, and money to be driven by both transitory as well

as permanent shocks.

For ease in obtaining an explicit, uncluttered

solution to the stochastic sticky price equilibrium, we shall suppose that

both y and m are simple random walks and thus that shocks to supply and
money are solely permanent. However, it will be useful to allow for both
a transitory as well as a permanent component in the relative demand shock

d. In particular, we suppose that a fraction y of any shock to relative

demand in period t is expected to be reversed in t+1.

Solving the Model
To solve the model, we begin by deriving an expression for the real

exchange rate qe that would prevail in a "flexible price" rational

expectations equilibrium in which output is

supply determined.

Substituting the laws of motion for yS and d into (10) and solving for
qe, we obtain:

The

"flexible price" real exchange rate depreciates in response to a

supply disturbance and appreciates in response to a demand disturbance.
We note that when -y >

0,

the expectation that the demand disturbance will

be partially reversed in the future sets up the expectation of real
depreciation and dampens the magnitude of the appreciation in the present.

We next derive an expression for the price level P°t that would
prevail in the "flexible price" rational expectations equilibrium. From
(12) and the definition of the real exchange rate, the pe must satisfy
(1

we obtain:

All three shocks influence the time path of the "flexible price" price
level. The "flexible price" relative price level rises in proportion to
the monetary shock, declines in proportion to the supply shock, and rises

in response to the temporary component in the demand shock.

A solely

permanent relative demand shock pushes up the common world level of real

and nominal interest rates in the flexible price equilibrium.

Thus,

given output supply and money, a permanent demand shock must drive up home

and foreign prices in proportion, leaving pe unchanged.

26

Collecting these expressions, we see that the evolution over time of

the flexible price equilibrium can be represented by the following three
equations:

In this flexible price equilibrium, the levels of relative output, y"., the

real exchange rate, q°, and relative national price levels, pe are driven
by three shocks -

to

supply, Zt, demand 8, and money, v. As can be seen

by inspection of (17), the system is triangular in the flexible price
equilibrium. Only supply shocks influence the level of relative national

outputs in the flexible price equilibrium, while both supply and demand
shocks influence the level of the real exchange rate. Finally, all three
shocks -

to

money, supply, and demand -

influence

the ratio of home to

foreign price levels in the flexible price equilibrium.

With this characterization of the system's flexible price
equilibrium, we now solve for the actual open macro equilibrium in a world

of sluggish price adjustment. Substituting (16) into the price setting

rule (11), we see that p, the ratio of home to foreign price levels,
evolves according to:

(18)

where a

shock, the price level rises but by less than does the flexible price P't.
In response to a positive supply shock the price level Pt falls but by less

27

than does the flexible price Pet. The degree of "sluggishness" is indexed
by (1 -

9).

When 9 — 1, prices are fully flexible, and the actual price

Pt coincides with P°t.

The expression for the real exchange rate q under sluggish price
adjustment can be obtained by substituting (10) and (13) into (12) and
using (18) to represent the difference between actual and market clearing

price levels. We obtain:

q, —

We see that when price adjustment is

sluggish, shocks to money influence the real exchange rate, even though

monetary shocks have no influence on the flexible price real exchange
rate. This follows from the renowned Dornbusch (1976) overshooting result

which is a property of our model when price adjustment is sluggish. The

Interestingly, this condition. implies the nominal

exchange rate will undershoot relative to the flexible price equilibrium

in response to real supply and demand shocks.

We note that sluggish

price adjustment implies that the real exchange rate undershoots relative

to the flexible price real exchange rate in response to real supply or
demand shocks.
Finally, we can use (19) and the IS equation to solve for the demand

determined level of output in the "short run" when price adjustment is
sluggish. We obtain:
(20)

Yt — Y3t + (, + a)v(1 -

O)(v - z,
28

+ a7&t).

Sluggish price adjustment implies that not only supply, but also money and

demand shocks, influence y in the short run. A monetary shock boosts

output in the short run with sluggish price adjustment, while home
relative to foreign output rises in response to the temporary component in
the demand shock.

In the stochastic open macro equilibrium represented by equations
(18), (19), and (20), all three shocks -

to

money, supply, and demand -

influence contemporaneously the levels of all three of the system's
variables -

output,

the real exchange rate, and prices. However, because

output, the real exchange rate, and prices are expected to converge to
their flexible price equilibrium levels, the system is triangular in the

long run.

Indeed, with the simple price setting rule we employ, the

system is expected to converge to the flexible price equilibrium in a
single period. Only supply shocks are expected to influence the long run

level of relative output.

Supply and demand shocks are expected to

influence the long run level of the real exchange rate. And finally, both

real supply shocks and nominal monetary shocks are expected to influence
the long run level of prices at home and abroad.3 While these restriction

are intuitive and are easily and explicitly derived in our model, they
should also hold in many other specifications of a stochastic open macro

equilibrium, including those that arise in the cash-in-advance ArrowDebreu open macro models pioneered by Lucas (1982).

Drawing upon the

approach pioneered by Blanchard and Quah (1989), we will exploit these

quite plausible long run restrictions in an effort to identify the
influence of money, demand, and supply shocks on the behavior of real
exchange rates over the past twenty years.4

29

The Empirical Strategy
Our theoretical model implies that Yt' q, and Pt are nonstationary
in levels but stationary in first differences.5

Letting Xt [Y

irJ' denote the 3 by 1 vector of the system's 3 variables and

[z,

t. vt]' denote the 3 by 1 vector of the system's 3 structural
disturbances, we think of the data on Yt' qj, and irt as being generated
by the following structural moving average model:
(21)

Ax — C0e + Cef_1 ÷

+

where C0 is the 3 by 3 matrix that defines the contemporaneous structural
relationship among the system's 3 variables. As discussed earlier, if our
simple expository model actually generated the data, the structural moving
average model - and the estimated reduced form - would be a vector MA(l).

In general, we would expect and do find much richer dynamics in the data.
An important advantage of the Blanchard-Quah approach to identification is

that we do not have to take a stand on the dynamics. Rather, we use only

the longer run restrictions implied by our model - and many other open
macro models -

to

identify the structural Cj matrices from the data.

When we estimate a VAR, we do not directly recover estimates of the

structural moving average model. Rather, we estimate:
(22)

xt —

u

+ Riu1 + R2u2 + .

where u is a vector reduced form disturbances. We assume that there
exists a nonsingular matrix S such that u, —

S.

Comparing (21) with (22)

we see that: C0 — S, C1 — R1S, C2 — R2S, i.e. C(L) — R(L)S.
(23)

Thus:

u —

In addition to recovering estimates of the parameters that define the

reduced form moving average representation (22), we also recover an

30

estimate of the symmetric variance-covariance matrix of the of the reduced
form disturbances:

Euu't.

(24)

As is well known, the model (22) is underidentified: it is not possible to
obtain estimates of C0 and thus

without addition restrictions. To see

this suppose, as is common in the literature, that the structural shocks

are mutually orthogonal and that each has unit variance (the latter
requirement is without loss of generality). Then, from (23) and (24), we
see that:

C0C0' —

(25)

This representts a system of 9 equations in only 6 unknowns, the 3
variances and 3 covariances that define E.

Thus, 3 additional

restrictions are needed to identify C0 and to recover the times series of

structural shocks

as well as the structural system dynamics defined by

Identification

According to Blanchard-Ouah

It will be recalled that our open macro model is triangular in the

long run.

That is, only supply shocks Zt are expected to influence

relative output levels in the long run, while both supply and demand
shocks d are expected to influence the real exchange rate in the long run.

Shocks to money Vt are expected to have no long run impact on either
relative output levels or the real exchange rate. Using the notation of

our structural moving average model these restrictions are easily

the

restriction that

neither money v nor demand d shocks influence relative output levels in

C12(l) —

Similarly, the the restriction that money shocks v do not influence the
real exchange rate in the long run requires that:
(27)

C23(l) —

0.

We will now show that these 3

additional "long run" restrictions,

restrictions that are implied by our model as well as many other
open
macro models including simple real business cycle models, are sufficient

to identify the structural matrix C0, to recover the structural system
dynamics defined by C1, C2,

Empirical Results

In this section we present the empirical results that are at the
heart of this paper. Using the structural VAR to recover the results and

using our stochastic version of the Obstfeld (1985) open macro model to

interpret the results, we seek to answer two questions: what are the
sources of real exchange rate fluctuations since the collapse of Bretton

Woods and, in particular, how important are nominal shocks?

To answer

these questions, we look at three complementary ways to summarize the
results of a structural VAR: we calculate variance decompositions of the

real exchange rate, we compute "real time" historical decompositions of

the level of the real exchange rate, and we plot impulse responses of
output, the real exchange rate, and inflation to the structural supply,

demand, and nominal shocks to assess whether or not the shocks that our

procedure identifies as supply, demand, and nominal "look like" supply
demand and nominal shocks are supposed to look.

That is, by investigating

the impulse responses, we are checking whether or not our application of

the Planchard-Quah approach identifies structural shocks that "pass the
duck test".6

We begin by reporting the results of two variance decomposition
exercises for the log real exchange rate.

In the

first, reported in Table 3, the conditional variance of the level of the

log real exchange rate q at various horizons k is split into the

variance due to unforecastable

structural monetary shocks

unforecastable structural demand
structural supply shocks Zt+j, j

shocks,

— l,...,k.

and

vt÷3,

unforecastable

As can be seen from the

results reported in Table 3, nominal shocks account for a substantial
34

fraction of the conditional variance of the level of the real

exchange

rate at short horizons in Germany and Japan. For example in Germany, more

than 50 percent of the variance in forecasting the level of the real
exchange rate at a horizon of 4 quarters is due to monetary shocks. More
precisely, more than 50 percent of the 4 quarter variance in forecasting
the log level of the real exchange rate is attributed to the shock in the

system that has no long run effect on relative national output levels or

the level of the real exchange rate.

In Japan, more than one third,

nearly 35 percent, of the variance in forecasting the level of the dollar-

yen real exchange rate at a horizon of 4 quarters is due to monetary
shocks. According to our structural VAR, nominal shocks do not explain
much of the variance in forecasting the level of the real exchange rate in

Britain and Canada.

For example in Britain, only 1.3 percent of the

variance in forecasting the level of the real exchange rate at a horizon

of 4 quarters is attributed to monetary shocks; in Canada, less than 1
percent of the 4 quarter forecast variance is due to nominal shocks. We
shall discuss how to interpret these rather striking differences between
the importance attributed to nominal shocks in Germany and Japan and the

meager role attributed to nominal shocks in Britain and Canada after
investigating other results yielded by our structural VARs.
For all four countries, of the remaining variance in forecasting the

log level of the real exchange rate that is not attributed to nominal
shocks, virtually all is attributed to demand shocks, and virtually none

is attributed to supply shocks.

For example in Germany, of the 49.6

percent of the variance in forecasting the level of the real exchange rate

at a horizon of 4 quarters that is not due to monetary shocks, 42.7

35

percent is attributed to demand shocks and only 6.9 percent is attributed

to supply shocks. It will be recalled that we identify the demand shock

as that shock in the system that has no long run effect on relative
national output levels but that can have an effect on the real exchange
rate in the long run.
In forecasting the level of an 1(1) variable such as q, the variance

of the forecast error goes to infinity with the forecast horizon so that

the share of this variance attributed to monetary shocks - which
by
assumption can have no long run effects on the level of
zero with the forecast horizon.

q - must go to

Table 4 decomposes

the conditional variance of the change in the log real exchange rate
at various horizons k into fraction of the variance due to unforecastable

structural monetary shocks vt÷j, demand shocks, &+j, and unforecastabie
supply shocks Zt÷j, j —

l,...,k.

As the forecast horizon increases, these

conditional variance shares converge to the shares of the unconditional
variance of the change in each real exchange rate due to supply, demand,
and nominal shocks. As is evident from Table 4, this convergence is quite

rapid -

within

12 to 16 quarters.

We see that 41.1 percent of the

unconditional variance of the change in the dollar-DM real exchange rate
IS attributed to monetary shocks, 48.5 percent is attributed to demand
shocks, and 10.4 percent is attributed to supply shocks. According to our

decomposition, 35.2 percent of the unconditional variance of the change
in the dollar-yen real exchange rate is attributed to monetary shocks,
61.2 percent is attributed to demand shocks, and 3.6 percent is attributed

to supply shocks.

36

As was the case for the decompositions of the level of the dollar-

sterling and Canadian dollar real exchange rates reported in Table

3,

monetary shocks do not explain much of the unconditional variance of the

change in either of the real exchange rates.

For example, only 2.8

percent of the unconditional variance of the change in the dollar-sterling
real exchange rate is attributed to monetary shocks, with the bulk of

variance, 91.1 percent, being attributed to demand shocks.

Only 2.5

percent of the unconditional variance of the change in the US -Canadian
dollar real exchange rate is attributed to monetary shocks.

We next present in Charts

historical "real time"

decompositions of the level of each real exchange rate. The purpose of
this exercise is to assess whether or not the supply, demand, and nominal

shocks that our identification scheme recovers can plausibly be held
responsible for the time path followed by dollar real exchange rates since

the collapse of Bretton Woods.

In particular, we are interested in

assessing the extent to which our historical decompositions match up with

the Mundell-Fleming conventional wisdom about the dollar and policy mix
(Sachs (1985); Feldstein (1992)) during the 1970s and 1980s. For example,

it is one thing for our econometric strategy to identify monetary shocks
that account for 41 percent of the variance in the change in the dollar-DM

real exchange rate.

However, these variance decompositions only make

least to us -

episodes of "tight money" or "expansionary

dollar depreciation.

following way. In

the difference between the

actual log level of the real exchange rate and the level that would have

been forecasted based upon the history of the system up through 1974:3.

Thus, newslogq in 1982:3 reflects the cumulative impact of the three
structural shocks between 1974:4 and 1982:3.

Each panel of Chart 9

compares the actual path of the real exchange rate with the path that
would have prevailed if only

one

source of structural shocks had hit the

system. The top panel of Chart 9 compares the actual path of the dollar-

DM real exchange rate with the path that would have been followed
historically if only nominal shocks had hit the system, the center panel
of the chart compares the actual path of the dollar-DM real exchange rate

with the path that would have been followed

historically if only demand

shocks had hit the system, and the lower panel of Chart 9 compares the
actual path of the dollar-DM real exchange rate with the path that would
have been followed historically if only supply shocks had hit the system.

We find these result most interesting. As can be seen in the top

panel of the chart, virtually all of the dollar's real depreciation
against the DM in the late l970s is attributed to nominal shocks, while
most of the dollar's real appreciation

against the DM in the first half of

the l980s is attributed to demand shocks.

Note, however, that a not

insubstantial real dollar appreciation against the DH during the early
l980s, one that would unwind the real depreciation of the late 1970s, is

attributed to nominal shocks,

Of the dollar's post-Plaza real

depreciation against the DM, roughly half is attributed to nominal shocks,

38

and half is attributed to demand shocks. Supply shocks are not attributed

a significant role in explaining the dollar-DM real exchange rate since
the collapse of Bretton Woods.
Chart 10 presents the results for the dollar-yen real exchange rate.

As is the case for the historical decomposition of the dollar-DM real
exchange rate, the dollar's real depreciation against the yen in the late

1970s is attributed to nominal shocks, while most of the dollar's real
appreciation against the Dli in the first half of the l980s is attributed

to demand shocks. Note however that between 1979 and 1982, a real dollar
appreciation against the yen that would be sufficient to unwind the real

depreciation of the late 1970s, is attributed to nominal shocks. Supply
shocks in favor of Japan are also attributed about 10 percentage points of

the dollar's appreciation during the early l980s. Of the dollar's post-

Plaza real depreciation against the yen, virtually all is attributed to
demand shocks.

Charts 11 and 12 present the results for the dollar-sterling and
dollar-Canadian dollar real exchange rates. (PLACE CHARTS 10 AND 11 HERE)

Perhaps not surprisingly, in light of the variance decomposition results
presented in Tables 3 and 4, monetary shocks are attributed only a trivial

role in accounting for the history of the dollar -

sterling

and dollar-

Canadian dollar real exchange rates. For these currencies, the time path

of the real exchange rate is essentially the time path attributed to
demand shocks. To summarize, dollar-DM and dollar-yen real exchange rates
are driven primarily by both money and demand shocks that produce a quite

plausible history real exchanges, while dollar-sterling and Canadian
dollar real exchange rates are driven almost exclusively by a shock that

39

is identified to be a demand shock. For no real exchange rate, with the
possible exception of the dollar-yen rate, are supply shocks identified to

explain any substantial movement in real exchange rates.

We now investigate the impulse dynamics of the four estimated open
macro models in response to the three structural shocks. Our objective to

assess the extent to which shocks that our identification strategy
identifies as due to demand, supply, and money generate dynamic and long
run responses that are consistent with the Mundell-Fleming-Dornbusch model

presented in section four. For example, according to that model, a demand

shock in favor of US output should result in a real appreciation of the
dollar, a rise in US prices, and a rise in US output if prices are sticky.

To the extent that the demand shock is permanent, the model predicts that
the real appreciation of the dollar will be permanent as well. A nominal

shock which increases the US money supply or reduces US money demand
relative to the foreign country should result in a nominal depreciation

of the dollar, a rise in US prices, and a rise in US output and a real
depreciation of the dollar if prices are sticky. To the extent that the
shock to money supply or money demand is permanent, the model predicts

that the nominal depreciation of the dollar will be permanent as well.
Finally, a supply shock that boosts US output relative foreign output is

predicted to result in a real depreciation of the dollar, a fall in US
prices, and a rise in US output. To the extent that the demand shock is

permanent, the model predicts that the real depreciation of the dollar
will be permanent as well.

40

Table 5 presents the impulse response results for the
structural VAR.

US-Germany

In response to a one standard deviation nominal shock,

the structural dynamics fit remarkably closely the predictions of the
Mundell-Fleming-Dornbusch model. There is an initial 3.8 percent real

depreciation of the dollar, a nearly 0.5 percent rise in US output
relative to German output, and a 0.3 percent rise in US inflation relative

to German inflation. Chart 13A depicts this dynamic response, and reveals
that the output and real exchange rate effects of a nominal shock die out

after 16 to 20 quarters.

Chart l3b compares the

impulse response of the nominal dollar-DM exchange rate with the real
dollar-DM exchange rate.

We see that the nominal

dollar-DM exchange rate overshoots substantially: in the long run the

dollar depreciates by 1.7 percent against the DM, while initially the
nominal dollar-DM exchange rate depreciates by more than 4 percent. We
also note that the nominal dollar-DM exchange rate does not appreciate
monotonically but that, instead, the exchange rate depreciates for several

quarters following the nominal shock. Indeed the maximum depreciation is

not achieved until 4 quarters after the initial nominal shock.

This

phenomenon has been recently uncovered using a completely different
empirical strategy by Eichenbaum and Evans (1993). We shall compare our
findings and approach with the Eichenbaum and Evans paper in section six.

Table 5 also presents the impulse response dynamics to a demand shock.
Again, the structural dynamics fit remarkably closely the predictions of

the Mundell-Fleming-Dornbusch model. There is an initial 4 percent real
appreciation of the dollar, a 0.36 percent rise in US output relative to
German output, and a 0.44 percent rise in US inflation relative to German

41

inflation.

In the long run, the demand shock causes the dollar to

appreciate by more than percent against the DM in real terms. The table

also presents the impulse responses to a one standard deviation supply
shock. Although US prices fall initially in response to the supply shock,

the dollar appreciates in real terms, in contradiction to the open macro
model presented above. In the long run, the real dollar-DM exchange rate

is essentially unchanged, even though the supply shock is forecasted to
have a permanent effect on US relative to German output.
Table 6 present the results for the US-Japan structural VAR.

As can be seen from the table, the impulse responses to a

nominal shock match the predictions of the theoretical model presented
earlier. There is an initial 3.4 percent real depreciation of the dollar,

a 0.56 percent rise in US output relative to Japanese output, and a 0.33
percent rise in US inflation relative to Japanese inflation.

Chart 14A depicts this dynamic response, and reveals that the
output and real exchange rate effects of a nominal shock die out after 12
to 16 quarters.

As shown in Chart 14B, the dollar-

yen nominal exchange rate overshoots: in the long run

nominal dollar-yen

exchnage rate depreciates by 1.2 percent, while initially the dollar
depreciates by more than 3.5 percent against the yen. As is the case for

the dollar-DM, the nominal dollar-yen exchange rate does not appreciate
monotonicali.y but, instead, depreciates for two quarters following the
nominal shock.

Table 6 also presents the impulse responses to a one

standard deviation demand shock.

There is an initial 4.4 percent real

appreciation of the dollar-yen exchange rate, a 0.36 percent rise in US
output relative to German output, and a nearly 0.43 percent rise in US

42

inflation relative to German inflation. In the long run, the demand shock

causes the dollar to appreciate by 5.5 percent against the yen in real
terms. Finally, and in contrast to the US-German results, the
real dollar-yen exchange rate depreciates in response to a supply shock
that boosts US output relative Japanese output, just as predicted by the
theoretical presented above.
Tables 6 and 7 present the impulse response results for Britain and
Canada.

For the most part, the results for

these two countries are similar to those we have just discussed in detail

for Germany and Japan.

Nominal shocks lead to short run real

depreciation, a rise in US output, and a jump in US inflation. Demand
shocks lead to short and long run real appreciation, a temporary rise in
US output, and a temporary jump in US inflation. In Canada, supply shocks

boost relative US output, lower temporarily US inflation, and lead to a

short and long run real depreciation of the dollar.

In Britain, the

results are qualitatively close to those reported for Germany: a supply
shock that boosts US output relative to British is forecasted to result in
a real appreciation of the dollar-sterling exchange rate, in contradiction

to the theoretical model.

43

Concluding Remarks

For two of the four countries we have investigated, Japan and
Germany, our structural VAR

estimates

imply that nominal shocks explain a

substantial amount of the variance in dollar-DM and dollar-yen real
exchange rates. In particular, we find that more than 41 percent of the
unconditional variance of the change in the dollar-DM real exchange rate,

and more than 35 percent of the variance of the change in the dollar-yen

real exchange rate are attributed to nominal shocks. Expressed in terms
of conditional forecasts, we find that 45 percent of the 4 -quarter ahead

forecast error variance of the log level of the dollar-DM real exchange

rate is attributed to nominal shocks, and that 34 percent of the 4 -

quarter

forecast variance of the log dollar-yen real exchange rate is

attributed to nominal shocks.

For the other two countries we study,

Canada and Britain, our

structural VAR estimates imply that nominal shocks explain very little of

the variance in real exchange rates. At one level, the reason for these

contrasting results is easy to understand.

Given the information set

implied by our structural model, very little of the change in either the

dollar-sterling or the dollar-Canadian dollar real exchange rate is
forecastable, a fact documented with our non-structural Beveridge-Nelson

decompositions. It follows that our, or any, structural model that uses
this information set will be unable to attribute much to nominal shocks
which can only have a transitory effect on the real exchange rate. Perhaps

a different, or larger, information set would imply much greater
forecastablility in the dollar-sterling and the dollar-Canadian dollar

real exchange rates.

However, it should be noted that achieving
44

identification with a larger information set might very prove to be a
daunting task. We have not attempted this, and leave this as a topic for
future research.

Our findings for the dollar-DM and dollar-yen real exchange rates
are quite consistent with those reported recently in an insightful paper
by Eichenbauin and Evans (1992). Eichenbaum and Evans attempt to isolate
the innovations in monetary policy using VARs that include either federal

funds rate or the ratio of non-borrowed to total reserves. Their VARs
also include either a nominal or real exchange rate as well as US and
foreign output and prices.

These authors find that from between 13

percent to 42 percent of the 12 -

quarter

ahead forecast error variance of

the log level of the dollar-DM real exchange rate is attributed to US
monetary policy innovations depending upon how they specify the system,

and they report that from between 13 to 23 percent of the 12 -

quarter

ahead forecast error variance of the log dollar-yen real exchange rate is

attributed to US monetary policy innovations.7 As can be seen from our
Table 3, our structural VAR approach attributes 28 percent of the 12 -

quarter

ahead forecast error variance of the log level of the dollar-DM

real exchange rate to nominal shocks, and it attributes 15 percent of the

12 -

quarter

ahead forecast error variance of the log dollar-yen real

exchange rate to nominal shocks. Thus, our estimates of the contribution
of nominal shocks to explaining the short run variance in forecasting the

log levels of the dollar-DM and dollar-yen real exchange rates are near

the respective midpoints of the estimates presented in Eichenbauni and
Evans (1992).8

45

A recent paper by Lastrapes (1992) also uses the Blanchard-Quah
identification strategy to estimate the importance of nominal shocks in

explaining the behavior of real exchange rates.

Unlike our paper,

Lastrapes does not claim to, and his approach cannot, identify an open
economy macro model with his structural VAR. He investigates bivariate
VARs containing changes in the log real exchange rate and changes in the
log nominal exchange rate. Thus, his system can only identify two shocks,

a "real" and a "nominal" shock.

In particular, his system cannot

distinguish between supply and demand shocks.

Lastrapes (1992)

acknowledges that if the world is subject to more than a single real
shock, his identification strategy is potentially compromised. Perhaps
for this reason, our estimates of the importance of nominal shocks for the

dollar-DM and dollar-yen real exchange rates substantially exceed those

reported in Lastrapes (1992).
percent (34 percent) of the 4 -

For example, whereas we find that 45

quarter

ahead forecast error variance of

the log level of the dollar-DM (dollar-yen) real exchange rate is
attributed to nominal shocks, Lastrapes only attributes 27 percent (6
percent).

One contribution of this paper has been to demonstrate that the
short run dynamic responses of relative national outputs, prices, and the
real exchange rate to nominal, demand, and, at least for Japan and Canada,

supply shocks are consistent with the predictions of a stochastic,
rational expectations version of the textbook Mundell-Fleming model.
These findings, along with the variance and historical decompositions
reported above, and the complementary findings reported in Eichenbaum and

Evans (1992), suggest to us that sluggish price adjustment must be

46

incorporated into any effort to explain short run fluctuations in real

exchange rates (Mussa (1986)).

This being said we also note that,

according to our estimates, real shocks to supply and demand account for
more than 50 percent of the variance in forecasting real exchange rates -

except at short horizons for the dollar-DM real exchange rate. Campbell
and Clarida (1987) and Stockman (1987) have emphasized "real" explanations

for real exchange rate volatility. Our findings do not suggest that these
efforts are misplaced. Obviously, real shocks must be present if we are to

believe the many papers that find evidence of a unit root in the real
exchange rate since the collapse of Bretton Woods.

1. The exception is Japan, for which we investigate the slightly shorter

sample period 1975:3 - 1992:4.

We do this for comparability with the

results presented above for the Japan [q,r] system for which our
Euromarket data only become available in 1975:3. Following Hansen and
Hodrick ((1983) pp. 120-121), we also investigated samples for Germany,

Canada, and Britain that "excluded the transitional early years of the
floating exchange rate era". As Hansen and Hodrick point out, it was not
until November 1975 that the G6 countries "produced an agreement which led

directly to the amendments to the Articles of Agreement of the IMF which

formally ratified the flexible exchange rate system." While none of the

results for Germany, Britain, or Canada reported in this paper are
sensitive to the choice of a starting date of 73:3 vs 75:3, some of the
results for Japan are. Data sources are as follows: CPI data are from the

IFS tape; the spot exchange rates and the Euromarket interest rates are
point sampled from a data base maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York; the real GDP data is from the OECD Main Economic Indicators.

2. For expository convenience, and to parallel the bulk of the literature
on "sticky price" open macro models cited above, we follow Obstfeld (1985)

and do not explicitly incorporate the accumulation of foreign assets
(debts) via current account surpluses (deficits) that may result from the

shocks we study. We also ignore a time varying risk premium. Later we

shall discuss the empirical implications of a risk premium for the
empirical strategy we pursue.

3. The two country Obstfeld (1985) model we study has the property that
the home relative to the foreign market clearing price level is invariant

to a permanent relative demand shock. This is not a general property of
an open-macro equilibrium so we do not use it for identification.

4.

The stochastic version of Obstfeld's (1985) model that we use to

motivate our identification strategy ignores, as does the bulk of the
literature, a time varying risk premium. If the equilibrium risk premium

is a stationary stochastic process that is a function of the three
structural shocks -

to

supply, demand, and money - on which we focus,

identification goes through as in the case, discussed in the text, in
which the risk premium is assumed to be constant. However, the closedform solution to the model is a great deal more cumbersome.

also implies that there exists no cointegrating relationships among Yt' q.,
and Pt.

Tests for cointegration among [Yt, qt, Pt) were performed using

Johansen's (1991) maximum likelihood procedure. For Germany and Japan, we

could not reject the null of no cointegration among these variables at
even the 20 percent significance level; for Britain, we could not reject

the null of no cointegration at the 10 percent level. For Canada, there
does appear to be evidence of a single cointegrating vector among these
three variables.

that innovations to US monetary policy account for from between 11 percent

to 26 percent of the variance In forecasting the log level of the dollar-

sterling exchange rate at a horizon of 36 months. From Table 3, we see

that we estimate that less than 1 percent of this variance is due to
nominal shocks.
