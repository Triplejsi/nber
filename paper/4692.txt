MONETARY POLICY RULES AND
FINANCIAL STABIUTY

ABSTRACT
This paper investigates empirically the possibility that a central bank could adhere to a

macro-oriented monetary policy rule while also providing lender-of-last-resort services to the
financial system. The method considered involves smoothing week-to-week movements of an
interest rate instrument so as to achieve quarterly-avenge intermediate targets for the monetary

base, with these specified so as to keep aggregate nominal spending growing steadily at a

noninflationary rate. Simulations utilizing weekly U.S. data are conducted with a system
consisting of a policy rule for the federal funds rate—one designed to hit monetary base targets
obtained from a quarterly macroeconomic rule--and an empirically-based model of the response

of base growth to funds rate movements. Results for the periods 1974-1979 (Sept.) and 19881991 suggest that such a procedure could succeed in reconciling macroeconomic goals with the
provision of lender-of-last-resort services.

Introduction

The subject

matter of this session

is

the relationship

between the two

ultimate goals recognized by most central banks, namely, macroeconomic
stability and financial—system stability.1 This is an extremely broad topic

and one that could be approached by various distinct methods of
analysis——evolutionary/historical, welfare theoretic, institutional, etc.
But given my own experience relative to others on the program, it seems most

appropriate for me to narrow the scope of the assignment by focusing
primarily

on one limited but extremely important set

of issues.

These issues, which are closely interrelated, concern macro—oriented
rules for monetary policy and the central bank's role as a lender of last
resort. Are macro—oriented rules——such as those advocated by KcCallum (1988,
1993), Meltzer (1987), or Taylor (1988, 1993)——inappropriate because of their

neglect of financial market conditions? If so, might these rules be modified

so as to overcome that neglect?
lender—of—last—resort

Does

acceptance

of

these

responsibilities require the operation of a discount window? Or could they
be satisfied, as suggested by Goodfriend and King (19881, by means of open
market operations that involve smoothing of interest rates?

As here formulated, the answers to these questions depend to a large
extent upon the accuracy with which it is possible for the central bank to

interest rate instrument while practicing smoothing——i.e.. while avoiding

large week—to—week changes in the interest rate. Consequently, a substantial

portion of the paper is

devoted to an

attempt to measure this accuracy

empirically. As the econometric methods utilized are rather rudimentary, our

results must be regarded as exploratory, rather than definitive, in nature.

But estimation of a fully structural model is inhibited by data limitations
1

and identification problems, so our first—pass analysis may be difficult to
improve upon substantially,

in any event, it will provide a starting point

for further consideration of the issue.

Organizationally, the analysis begins in Section II with an overview
discussion of the broad topic of this session, a discussion which serves to
Justify our attention on the narrower set of issues described above. Section

III is then devoted to a backgrotmd review of some results relating to
monetary policy rules, formulated at the quarterly frequency, in which the

monetary base is treated as a policy instrument.

Section IV develops a

framework for the study of a system in which quarterly-average base values
are viewed as targets to be achieved by manipulation at the weekly frequency

of an interest rate instrument. Basic simulation results pertaining to this

system are given in Section V while Section VI takes up some alternative
formulations. Finally. Section VII contains a brief recapitulation.

jJ Monetary Policy Rules for the Lender of Last Resort?
Before focusing our attention as described above it will be useful to

justify that strategy by reference to the broader topic assigned for this
session: the relationship between the goals of macroeconomic and financial
stability.

The tension between these goals has recently been expressed by

Folkerts-Landau and Garber (1992), writing about the design of the European
Central Barth, in terms of the aphorism1 "A bank or a monetary policy rule?"
More generally, many economists have expressed doubts as to the compatibility

of a strict monetary policy rule——or in any case one featuring a monetary
base instrument-—with central bank acceptance of lender—of—last—resort

(LLR)

responsibilities,2 The achievement of a base path as dictated by the rule
would conflict, according to this position, with the need to supply liquidity
at times of crisis in accordance with the central bank's role as a LLR.

Recent discussions of alternative viewpoints pertaining

role——see e.g., Bordo (1990), Humphrey (1992), and Summers (1991)——have
identified tour main positions. These are (I) the classical Thornton—Bagehot

doctrine, (ii) a "modern—pragmatic" position that calls (or more lenient

management of the discount window, (iii) the so—called "free banklng
contention that no public LLR is needed, and (iv) a "monetarist" scheme,
developed primarily by Goodtriend and King (1988), that calls (or LLR actions
via open—market operations rather than the discount window.3

As most readers will know, the classical doctrine developed by Thornton

(1802) and Bagehot (1873) calls for the US to lend aggressively at times of

crisis,4 to any solvent institution providing good collateral, but at a
penalty rate (a concept discussed below). This policy should, moreover, be

publicly known to prevail. A major objective is to support illiquid but
solvent institutions, thereby providing protection for the banking system
rather than for individual banks.5 Actual practice of the Federal Reserve in
recent years has deviated from the Thornton—Bagehot prescription in a number

of ways (Garcia and Plauti, 1988).

Thus the Fed lends only to depository

institutions, rather than to any sound institution, and at rates that
represent subsidies to the borrowers.

It has not spelled out its policies

banks.

"free banking" type have, despite the efforts of White

(1984),

Selgin (1987), Glasner (1989). and Dowd (1989), received little

support

among monetary economists in general.

Different writers on the

subject have expressed different criticisms of the proposals. Laidler (1992,

depositor to denominate deposit liabilities also in fixed nominal terms"
(Goodhart. 1937,

pp. 36—87),

But "the combination ... of the nominal

of bank assets, leads to the possibility of runs on individual banks and

commodity (e.g.. gold or silver coin).8 But the situation is, of course,

of objections to the Gocdfriend—King

by a "penalty rate."

It must presumably not be a rate in excess of the

current market rate because the latter is the rate at which borrowers can
obtain funds.

What )leltzer has in mind, I believe, is a rate that is

somewhat above recent market rates.

An example for the United States might

be the previous week's average for the Federal Funds

Under this interpretation it becomes clear

that the Meltzer and

Goodfriend-King position are, though different, highly compatible.

For

interest rate smoothing, as prescribed by the latter, would presumably never

permit the Funds rate to rise to a level as much as 2 percentage points (for
example) above the previous week's average.

At some lower value—-its exact

involved rapid money growth" (1991, p. 149).

But this point is irrelevant,

since the Goodfriend—King prescription does not call for the Fed to keep
money growth steady.

A more relevant claim of Summers' goes as follows:

"The crucial point here is that driving down the federal funds rate is not
likely to be sufficient to stop prophesies that predict the failure of banks
or securities firms from proving to be self—fulfilling. A more ambitious set
of lender—of—last resort policies would seem to be necessary" (1991, p. 150).
But Summers's "demonstration" in this case is based neither on experience nor

theoretical reasoning, but on a totally imaginary "scenario" that he created

out of thin air and used in several places in this paper.

There is very

little reason, consequently, to give any weight to this second claim.

There is, however, an important gap in the argument of Goodfriend and

in particular, their analysis relies upon

the existence of interest rate smoothing but does not provide any evidence
that such smoothing can be practiced without

In previous studies

of monetary policy.

(See McCallum 1988, 1990a, 1990b, 1993. )

The objective

is to generate a time path for nominal aggregate spending that
grows smoothly at a non—inflationary rate, with nominal CNP being the

An objection that has been raised by some critics of the rule is that it

relies upon the monetary base as an instrument variable.

Actual central

banks strongly prefer, of course, to focus their day—to—day operations on

short—term interest rates, such as the Federal Funds rate in the United
States or the overnight call rate in Japan. This preference arises from a
belief that day—to—day and week—to—week interest rate volatility would be
greatly increased if attempts were made to keep the monetary base (or any
other reserve aggregate) in strict conformity with the values specified by
the policy rule in question.

But since the rule pertains to quarterly—average values of the base,
there exists the conceptual possibility of achieving these values to a fairly

high degree of accuracy while using an interest rate variable as the control

instrument on a daily or weekly basis.

And obviously this possibility is

closely related to the Goodfriend—King method for providing US

That

rule will be designed to hit weekly targets for the monetary base that will
yield quarter—average values for the base that are dictated by the quarterly
macroeconomic rule used in McCallua (1993).

The remainder of this section

will be devoted to an explanation of that rule, some results concerning its

performance in simulations of the U.S. economy, and the generation of
intermediate target values for the monetary base that will be used to
generate weekly targets for the exercise in Sections tV—VT. 13

In

my earlier studies for the United States the x values were taken to increase
each quarter by 0.00739, i.e., to reflect constant growth of nominal GW' at a

rate of 3 percent per year.

This value was chosen to give a time path of

realized x values that would grow at approximately the rate of long—term
annual growth of L!ii ClIP, since that would yield, an average inflation rate

of approximately zero.

We are now finally in a position to proceed with the main business of
this section from the perspective of the present paper. That business is to

generate quarterly time paths for the monetary base that conform to the
macroeconomic policy rule (1), in order to determine whether a funds rate
instrument can be used at the weekly frequency to achieve these base values
at the quarterly frequency. For that purpose, let us adopt the time path of

examination. Values of b for this simulation, which are reported in Table
4, imply corresponding 6b growth rates that will be used in the next section
as the basis of intermediate targets specified at the weekly level, with the
federal funds rate treated as the instrument variable.

IV. Hitting Base Targets with An Interest Rate Instrument
The purpose of this section and the next two is to determine whether it

would be possible to exert sufficiently accurate base control, as suggested
above1

with an operating procedure that uses

an interest rate instrument and

involves rate smoothing as a means of providing Liii protection to the
financial system. Our approach will be to conduct simulations with a system
that pertains to weekly data for the United States. The system will consist
of a policy rule that sets weekly values of the federal funds rate, together

with a weekly model of monetary base determination that is intended to
reflect the effects of federal funds rate behavior on realized magnitudes of

the base.

The model will be extremely simple, but should give some

indication of the accuracy with which quarterly base targets can be achieved

while

holding down funds—rates movements, i.e.,

engaging in funds—rate

smoothing.

The form of policy rule involved will be as follows, with time periods
referring to weeks:
(2)

R. —

= — eEb_1 —

Here a, denotes the funds rate (in annual percentage points) and b denotes
the log of the monetary base, both averaged over the week. The value b: is

the target value of b for week r.

The idea is that values of b would be

derived in practice from quarterly magnitudes specified by a higher—level
policy rule such as those generated by equation (1) of Section III.

For the

purposes of the present exercise, b values will be treated as exogenous and
one objective will be to determine how closely realized b, values track those

and smoothing; small

(say,

The second ingredient of our system, then, is a model at the weekly

In principle, one

would like to utilize a carefully specified and estimated structural model
pertaining to banks' demand for reserves and the public's demand for
currency.

Data non—availability and time constraints have, however, made that

infeasible. What I have done instead is to estimate a weekly univariate ARMA

model for

tb, which should serve to depict with fair accuracy the

autocorrelation structure and variability of movements in the base. A term

reflecting

current—week responses to changes in the funds rate R., is then

added to this relation, with the response coefficient being based partly on

values taken from Federal Reserve literature and partly on empirical
estimates. These estimates are generated from weekly movements in the funds

Jan. 1983—Dec. 1991, and Jan. 1989—Dec. i991. The estimates are presented in

long used." That rule of thumb is described as $400 million per percentage

point, but I would expect the ratio of borrowed to total reserves to be
related to the interest spread with greater stability. A $400 million change
in borrowed reserves would then amount to approximately a fraction of 0.02 of
total reserves with the latter being about $20 billion at the date (May 1981)

referred to by Cook. But a change in borrowed reserves brought about by an
open

market action would have an effect on the, base of about the same

magnitude in terms of dollars, so the percentage change in the base would be

In a complete model the average growth rate of the base

include any component that would accomplish such an endogenization. That is,

the system includes no mechanism that would generate a positive relationship

between R, and tab, values at low frequencies——i.e., on average over long
spans of time. Only the short—term negative relationship is included. But
the average value of tab, generated In the simulation needs to match that of

Basic Simulation Results
Let us now consider the outcome of the experiment described in the

previous section.

Some statistical results for four different values of 0,

the policy parameter in rule (2). are given in Table 6.

Before examining

them, however, it may be useful to consult Figure 4, which plots the target

path b (denoted LBTAR) and the simulated path b., (denoted IS) in the case

Visual inspection will show that the rule is rather successful

in this simulation in keeping b, close to b, especially when the unusually

Indeed, with B = 100 they are quite favorable. This finding suggests

that other specifications of the policy rule could be substantially superior
to our equation (2), but a systematic investigation of that possibility will

have to be reserved for future study. The object of the present paper is to
explore the feasibility of a Goodfriend—King type of rule, not to attempt an
optimization analysis.

The two sample periods utilized in our study were chosen for
reasons——concerning possible regime changes and conformity with previous
studies——that have considerable merit.

Several commentators on the paper

have suggested, however, that the study's value would be greater if the stock

market crash of September 1987 were included in the second sample and
simulation period.

Accordingly, additional results have been obtained with

that period extended so as to include July 1987 — Dec. i99i, rather than Jan.
1988 — Dec. 1991.

With that extension, the estimated weekly AB}4A model corresponding to
those in Table 5 differs only slightly from the results in the final column.
In particular, the SE value rises only to 0.0038 (from 0.0037) and the Q(36)

statistic actually falls somewhat, to 38.4. With the MA(26) coefficient and

the Jan. 2, 1991 dummy variable again suppressed, and the constant term
obtained as before, the implied base growth model is as follows:

Results using the basic policy rule (2) wIth e values of 100 and 150, and
also the three variants introduced in this section, are reported in Table 9.

There it will be seen that inclusion of the October 1987 stock market crash
in the sample and simulation periods does not significantly alter the outcome

of our exercise.

In fact, the results are slightly better than those

reported for 1988—1991 in Tables 7 and 8.

VII. Conclusion

It may be useful to conclude with a summary of the foregoing analysis
and

results.

The argument begins by noting that a central

bank's dual

objectives of macroeconomic and financial stability imply a tension that may

be expressed in terms of the following question: is the adherence to a
macro—oriented rule for monetary policy compatible with satisfaction of a
central barüCs lender—of—last—resort (Lilt) responsibilities? In Section II,
a brief review of alternative views on the Lilt role indicates that a proposal

by Goodfriend and King (1988) might provide a way of reconciling the two
objectives. For the proposal is to have LLR assistance supplied entirely by

open—market operations,

with no discount window lending

but

high—frequency smoothing of movements of a money market interest rate.

with

The

point is that smoothing of day—to-day or week—to-week movements in this
interest rate would automatically trigger open—market purchases whenever a
sharp increase in the demand for high—powered money happened

to occur.

But

such week-to-week smoothing could perhaps be compatible with use of this
interest rate as an instrument for hitting slightly lower—frequency (e.g..
quarterly average) intermediate targets conforming to a monetary policy rule
designed to yield desirable macroeconomic performance.

The bulk of the present paper constitutes an attempt to expiore this
possibility

quantitatively.

Previous

This last figure naturally reflects somewhat more interest rate variability

than has been experienced in the United States, but the increase is not
dramatic——actual RI€

values for our two sample periods were about 0.2

percentage points with a maximum of almost 1.6.
It would admittedly be desirable in principle to conduct this type of

exercise with a more elaborate and more nearly structural model of base
determination.

But data limitations and identification problems make the

feasibility of such a study questionable.

In any event, the results

developed here should be useful as an initial quantitative indication of the
workings of a macroeconomic policy rule for the lender of last resort.

Footnotes

1flere I have described the first goal as "macroeconomic stability" rather
than "price level stability" since most central banks are evidently concerned

with the mitigation of cyclical fluctuations in economic activity as well as

the avoidance of inflation.

Issues involving the relative weight to be

attached to these two aspects of macroeconomic stability will not be
explicitly considered in this paper.
2See, for example, Summers (1991) and Soloi,s (1982).

3Friedaan (1960) argued much earlier for elimination of the discount window.

His proposal is significantly different from that of Goodfriend and King,
however, since it calls for a system with 100 percent reserves and does not
promote interest rate smoothing.

Other recent arguments for closing the

discount window have been put forth by Kaufman (1991) and Schwartz (1992).

4Since Bagehot's proposal involves a penalty rate, it would appear that one
could replace "at times of crisis" with "at all times." This implication was
not mentioned by Bagehot, however, and has also been ignored by most writers
on the subject.

5For a more complete discussion of Bagehot's position, see Humphrey (1989.
1992).

Store typical, I believe, is the view taken by Nakajima and Taguchi (1993).

7Although their main purpose is to present their own analysis and proposal,
Merton and Bodie (1993) provide a large number of references. A synopsis of
bank failures is provided by Goodtiart and Shoenmaker (1993).

As I have not provided evidence on this point, my statement is actually a
conjecture.

To develop such evidence adequately, would itself consitute a

major study.

18These results were developed in my 1988 paper. In McCallum (1990a) it was
found that substitution of an

explicit price level target, rather than

nominal Clip, is somewhat less satisfactory since it leads to an increased

likelihood of instrument

instability.

Also, a few

experiments with an

interest rate instrument were attempted. In KcCallua (1990b) the purpose was

to determine whether adherence to rule (1) would have prevented the Great

Depression of the 1930s.

The simulation results suggest that

nominal ClIP would have been kept reasonably close to a steady 3 percent
growth path over 1923-1941 if the rule had been in effect, in which case it

seems extremely unlikely that real output and employment would have
collapsed, as they did in fact.

19Such a target would result in a nominal GNP path that has a unit—root
component——indeed, that is close to a random walk with drift.

But if the

drift magnitude were 0.00739, or whatever is the average rate of output
growth, then expected inflation over any horizon would be zero. Furthermore,

price level variability over practical planning horizons would not be
excessive if the variability of x —

follows. Let 8 = (1/Th)dBRidrs be the parameter that is estimated as 0.02 on
the basis of the quoted rule of thumb, with BR, 111, NBR, and rs denoting

borrowed reserves, total reserves, nonborrowed reserves, and the

funds

rate—discount rate spread. But we presume that the relevant experiment is an

open—market purchase (sale) that increases (decreases) nonborrowed reserves
leaving borrowed reserves unaffected.

as (—1/Th)dNBRjdrs

The estimate of 8 is then interpreted

(—11TR)dTR/drs and therefore as —dlogTR/drs.

But with

currency assumed not to respond within the week, we have dB/dTR —

I (where B

denote the base) so dlogB/dlogTR = (TRiB)dBidTR = ThIS.

Thus we finally

dlogB/drs = (dlogB/dlogTR)dlogwjdrs = -e(TRJB) = —0.02/8

obtain

But policy behavior during the 1988—1990 period should

be more like that of 1974—1979, since both of these featured

tighter control

During i984—i987 the operating procedure was one of the

"borrowed reserves targeting" type.

23This suggestion is related to a major theme of a recent
paper by ciristiano
and £ichenbaujrj (1992).

24A weakness of our procedure that pertaims to this sample period is as
follows.

Since our simulation exercise presumes that total reserves (not

currency) is the

market

component of the base that

responds during the week to open

actions, we are implicitly assuming that the regime is not one with

lagged reserve requirements (which makes the demand for reserves almost

entirely predetermined), That is of course counterfactual for 1974—1979.

But that is of virtually no consequence,

unattractive feature of the results

is that M values are predominantly

over one long portion of the simulation period, and thus lead to

large negative values for the level of R.. But that is arguably an artifact
of the functional form used in (4): if a log—log function had been used
instead,

it would not have been possible to drive R negative.

I have kept

of

"non-borrowed reserves targeting." Oct. 1979 — 1982, would be appropriate for
the study.

My belief is just the opposite; the combination of a reserves

instrument plus a regime with lagged reserve requirements is extremely poorly

suited to monetary control and so would suggest much greater volatility than
would be experienced under a more sensible regime.
29For this period, weekly-average statistics on nonborrowed reserves include

observations only for every other week.
