RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN
ThE MARRIAGE TAX

ABSTRACT
The new tax law increases tax rates for high income individuals, and expands the earned

income tax credit for low income individuals. We use a sample of actual tax returns to compute
estimates of the "marriage tax" - the change in couples joint tax upon marriage - under this new

law. We predict that in 1994 52 percent of American couples will pay a marriage tax, with an

average of about $1,244; 38 percent will receive a subsidy averaging about $1,399. These
aggregate figures mask a considerable amount of dispersion in the population. Under the new
law, the marriage tax for certain low-income families can exceed $3,000 annually; for certain
very high income families it can exceed $10,000 annually.

changes in the personal income tax,

embodied in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (05RA93),

will

affect the tax liabilities of many Americans. The changes at

the two extremes of the income distribution are particularly
important. At the high end, marginal tax rates have been increased
substantially. At the low end, there has been a major expansion of

the earned income tax credit. The impacts of these changes on
economic behavior and tax revenues have already been the subject of

considerable attention. (See, for example, Feldstein and Feenberg

(1993) and Browning (1993].)

One issue that has received

relatively little analysis is the impact of the new law on the tax

consequences of marriage.

There has been some press attention

given to the fact that the new law may lead to increased income tax

liabilities for couples when they marry. The Wall Street Journal,
for example, discussed the case of a California couple who "put off

taking their wedding vows" because "marriage would cost us $7,000

or $8,000 a year."2 However, there has not been any systematic
discussion of how the law is actually likely to change the so-

called marriage taxes (and subsidies) for various groups in the
population. In this paper we explain and document the changes in
the marriage tax associated with the new tax law.

Section 2 explains more carefully what the marriage tax is,
and how OBRA93 affects it for various kinds of couples. In Section

3, we use data from a sample of actual tax returns to compute
estimates of the marriage tax by income class for the year 1994.
We predict that 52 percent of American couples will pay an annual
average marriage tax of about $1,244, and 38 percent will receive
an average subsidy of about $1,399. Relative to the old law, there

is not much of a change in the aggregate marriage tax. But the
aggregate figures mask important differences for certain income
groups.

Specifically, some low—income families will face much

higher marriage taxes than before. In this way, they are similar
to their counterparts at the opposite end of the income scale, for
some of whom the tax on being married will increase by thousands of

dollars. Section 4 concludes with a summary and a discussion of
some implications of the findings.

2. Backaround
The history of the marriage tax has been discussed carefully

in a number of articles; see, for example, Brozovsky and Cataldo
(1994] and Rosen (1987]. The basic source of the marriage tax is
the fact that key elements of the tax law depend on an individual's

family situation, including the rate schedule, the standard
deduction, and the earned income tax credit. Hence, the act of
getting married per se affects individuals' tax liabilities, even

if their work and saving decisions stay the same.

As we show

3

below, tax liabilities do not always increase; under some
circumstances, the tax system subsidizes marriage.
We now discuss the provisions of OBRA93 that are most relevant

to the calculation of marriage taxes and subsidies, and then
provide some illustrations of their significance.

2.1 Rate Schedules
Like the previous law, OBRA93 has different rate schedules

depending on the taxpayer's marital status. The top of Table 1
shows for 1994 the correspondence between marginal tax rates and

taxable income for married couples filing joint returns (the
husband and wife file together), married couples filing separate

returns, single individuals, and heads of households (unmarried
individuals who maintain a household that includes as a member a

son, daughter, or any other person eligible to be claimed as a
dependent.) Note that the breakpoints for the first two brackets
on the separate return are exactly half those of their counterparts

on the joint return. This means that in these brackets, a couple

could at best come out even by filing separate returns. For all
the filing statuses, the high end brackets are much higher than
they were before 1993. Specifically, the higher bracket rate used

to be 31 percent; now the maximum statutory marginal tax rate is
39.6 percent.3

The schedules in Table 1 suggest that, just as under previous

law, .it is possible for marriage to lower a couple's joint tax
liability.

If X has a taxable income of $30,000 and I has no

income, then if they marry, all of X's

taxable

income is subject to

4

a 15 percent rate, while before marriage, some would also be taxed

at a 28 percent rate.

But the possibility of tax liabilities

increasing with marriage is also present. If A and B each have
taxable incomes of $20,000 and file as singles, then their taxable

income is taxed at a rate of 15 percent. But if they marry, then
part of their income is taxed at a 28 percent rate. Hence, their
joint tax liability increases with marriage.
These comparisons are somewhat misleading because they fail to

take into account that couples and singles with the same Adjusted

Gross Income (AGI) have different taxable incomes due to
differences in the standard deductions they are allowed to take.

(These differences are documented in the bottom panel of the
table.) The calculations done below incorporate this information,

and the qualitative result that emerges is similar—-spouses with

roughly equal incomes tend to pay a marriage tax, while spouses
with unequal incomes tend to receive a marriage subsidy.

2.2 Earned Income Tax Credit

The provisions of the earned income tax credit (EITC) are
noted in the middle of the Table 1. The credit is a percentage of

household earnings that depends on the number of children in the

family. It ranges from 7.65 percent if there are no children to
30.0 percent if there are two or more. The credit is applied to
each dollar of earnings in a phase—in range, reaching a maximum at

the end of this range. Then it is implicitly taxed away over a
phase—out range. According to the table, for example, a family

with two or more children receives a credit of $2,528 if its

5

earnings are between $8,525 and $11,000.

The $2,528 is then

phased—out over the range from $11,000 to $25,299, so that for each

dollar of earnings over $11,000, the credit is reduced by 17.68
cents. Importantly, if the individual's tax liability is less than
the EITC, the difference is refunded.4

The key point in the marriage tax context is that on a joint

return, eligibility for the EITC is based on the couple's joint
earnings. Hence, an unmarried individual with a child may lose part

or all of the credit upon marriage. As we shall see, this can
impose a relatively high burden when both spouses have low earnings
but the sum of their earnings exceeds the threshold of the relevant

phase—out range.

2.3 Standard Deduction

The standard deduction allowed on each type of return is

recorded in the bottom of Table 1.

Note that the standard

deduction associated with two single returns Is $7,600 ( 2 x
$3,800); this exceeds the standard deduction on a joint return by

$1,250. This difference tends to create a penalty for marrying,
ceteris Daribus. The penalty is even more severe when two heads of

households marry; in this case, the loss of deductions amounts to
$4,850 ( — 2 x $5,600 —

$6,350).

2.4 Some Illustrations

This section illustrates how the provisions in Table 1
determine the tax consequences of marriage. These illustrations
assume that all income is from earnings and every return uses the
standard deduction. The only other subtraction from AGI to obtain

6

taxable income is the personal exemption of $2450 times the number

of people on the return. (The exemption is constant regardless of

filing status, although it is phased out for high income
individuals; see Young (1993).) The calculations also assume that
if 2-children couples split, each child is claimed as an exemption

on one tax return.

For the sake of comparison, we also compute

what the marriage tax would have been under the old law.5

The results are reported in Table 2, which shows marriage
taxes and subsidies for couples with various incomes under the old

and new laws. Results for childless couples and couples with two
children are reported separately. Negative numbers indicate that

tax liabilities go down with marriage.

Thus, for example, if

spouse I has an income of $10,000 and spouse II has zero income,

then if the couple is childless, under the new law the couple
receives an annual marriage subsidy of $562. However, when both
spouses earn $10,000, the couple's joint tax liability increases by

$188 with marriage, again assuming that there are no children.

Taken together, the figures

suggest the following

observations:

a. Exceot at the high-end of the income distribution. most
childless couoles face little chanae in the marriage tax. Although
the new law does introduce for the first time an EITC for childless

individuals, it is phased—out at such a low income level that most

of our hypothetical couples are not affected.

b. For many low—income couoles with children, the marriaae

tax is higher under the new law.

Indeed, for families at the

7

bottom end of the income distribution, the marriage taxes for twoearner families are so high that it is worthwhile to do one of the

calculations in detail.
children.

Consider a two—earner family with two

If each spouse makes $10,000 and they file a joint

return, their AGI is $20,000. Subtracting the standard deduction

of $6,350 and their exemptions of $9,800 (— 4 x $2,450) gives a
taxable income of $3,850 and a pre—EITC tax liability of $577.50 (

.15 x $3,850). The EITC for this family is $937, leading to a net
tax liability of —$359 ——

the

family gets a refund of $359.

Now asáuine that the spouses divorce, that spouse I takes one
child and files as a head of household, and that spouse II does the

same. Spouse I's tax calculation is as follows: AGI of $10,000
minus personal exemptions of $4,900 (— 2 x $2,450) and a standard

deduction of $5,600 gives a taxable income of zero, and a pre—
credit tax liability of zero, Subtracting an EITC of $2,038 leads

to a tax refund of $2,038. For spouse II, the situation is the
same. The sum of their tax liabilities is —4,076 ( —$2038 x 2).
Comparing this to the -$359 figure if they file jointly, we get a
difference of $3717, the figure in the table.6

The large marriage tax occurs partly because the standard
deduction on a joint return is $4,850 less than the sum of the
deductions on two head of household returns.

In addition, the

inclusion of both spouse's incomes on the joint return reduces the

total EITC. As the table makes clear, the previous law was also
quite

"anti—family"

for low—income workers with children. But by

increasing the importance of the EITC, the Clinton law makes it

8

more so.
c.

The tax law i,rovides a substantial "dowry" for an

individual with no income who marries someone with income.
Suppose, for example, that W, who has an AGI of $50,000, is living

with V, who has no income. They have no children. According to
the table, if they marry, W's tax liability decreases by about
$3,382. One spouse having zero income is not a necessary condition

for a dowry, however.

The figures indicate that marriage is

subsidized as long as the spouses' incomes are sufficiently far
apart.
d.

Conversely. the tax law oenalizes marriaae for couDles

whose incomes are relatively close.

Suppose C and H both have

$25,000 incomes. According to the table, if they are childless and

marry, their joint tax burden increases by $286.

This effect

becomes quite extraordinary for high income couples. If one spouse
has $300,000 and the other has $150,000, their joint tax liability

increases by over $12,000 if they marry. The comparable figure

under previous law was only $2,554; the huge increase is a
consequence of the fact that high—end marginal tax rates have been
increased so much by the new law.7

Taken together, the results in Table 2 suggest that OBRA 93,

like its predecessor, is far from marriage neutral. Some couples

will experience substantial tax increases upon marriage, others
substantial tax reductions. The discussion surrounding the table

also indicates that the marriage tax faced by a couple depends
crucially on the incomes of each of its members and on their number

9

of dependents, inter p11g. Hence, in order to say anything about
the actual magnitude of the marriage tax, we require estimates of

the joint distribution of these variables in the population. A
data set with such estimates is analyzed in the next section.

3. Simulation Results
In this section we use information from a sample of actual
rj.s. tax returns to calculate marriage taxes under OBRA93, and
compare their magnitudes to those under the old law. The figures
are generated by the Tax Simulation Model (TAXSIM) maintained by

the National Bureau of Economic Research.5

TAXSIM contains a

stratified random sample of 96,589 tax returns filed in 1989. To
obtain estimates for years subsequent to 1989, the data are "aged"—

—raised in proportion to the growth of population and income as

measured in the national income and product accounts.

The

adjustments used to make projections from 1989 to 1994 assume 18
percent nominal per capita income growth, a rate that is consistent

with Congressional Budget Office predictions of income tax
revenues. Unlike the simple examples of the previous section, the
tax computation allows for different tax rates on different sources

of income, itemized deductions, etc. Sample weights are applied to

the results on each return to obtain totals for the population as
a whole.

The sample used in this study consists of all joint returns.

Tax liabilities on these joint returns are calculated under both

the previous law (as it would have looked in 1994) and OBRA93.
Then, the joint tax liability of each couple is computed under the

10

assumption that a divorce occurs.

Tax returns do not contain

information on the division of family earnings between husbands and

wives. This was imputed using data from the March 1990 Current
Population Survey (CPS). For each tax return, we identified cPs
records that were similar with respect to family income and number

of dependents. We then allocated income on the tax return in
proportion to CPS earnings.

After divorce, any itemized deductions on the return are
allocated to the spouse with higher income. Members of childless
couples are assumed to file as singles. For couples with children,

we allocate all but one exemption to the higher—income spouse. If
there is only one child, he or she is claimed by the higher-income

spouse. Spouses who end up not claiming a child file as singles;

otherwise they file as heads of households.

This algorithm

approximates a strategy of joint tax minimization.

(It is

computationally difficult to minimize joint tax liability exactly

because deductions on certain items can be taken only when they

exceed some threshold percentage of AGI.)

Of course, one can

imagine other reasonable algorithms for allocating exemptions and

deductions between the spouses.

We experimented with several

others, such as allocating itemized deductions in proportion to
income, and found that the qualitative results were not materially
affected.

Column (1) in Table 3 shows the average marriage tax under

OBRA93 by AGI class.9 The figures in square brackets show the
comparable figures for the old law, The average tax is greatest

11

for the highest income group ($7,451), but there is no general
tendency for the tax to increase with income. The average marriage

tax for the population as a whole is $124. Under the old law, in

contrast, on average there was a subsidy to marriage of $143.

Hence, on average, the law has gone from being slightly pro—
marriage to slightly anti-marriage. The most striking differences

between the old and new laws arise for the higher income group,
where the average tax is $7,451, while under the old law it was a

subsidy of $3,667. This difference can be attributed to the 10

percent income tax surcharge on taxable incomes in excess of
$250,000 without distinction of marital status.

Of course, the averages in column (1) are over both positive

and negative values of the marriage tax. As stressed in the last
section, couples with about the same AGI can have marriage taxes of

different magnitudes and even oppásite signs; the outcome depends
upon the relative incomes of the spouses, inter qua. Hence, a low
marriage tax on average does not necessarily imply that the system

is even approximately marriage neutral. It can just as well mean
that some families have very high marriage taxes while others have

very high marriage subsidies.

To investigate this possibility, we divided the sample into

couples who pay a positive marriage tax and those who receive a
marriage subsidy, and calculated the average tax/subsidy for each

group. Column (2) of Table 3 shows the proportion of couples in
each AGI group who pay a positive marriage tax, and 'column (3)
shows the average tax paid by members of that group. Similarly,

12

column (4) shows the proportion who receive a marriage subsidy in

each AGI group, and column (5) the average subsidy received. (In
any given AGI group, the percentages in columns (2) and (4) may not

add to 100 percent because the tax liabilities of some couples are
approximately unchanged by marriage.)

The results in column (2) suggest that relatively few people

in the very lowest income bracket are penalized by marriage. The
proportion increases almost monotonically with AGI, becoming quite

substantial at the high end. In the $100,000—$200,000 range, for
example, 70 percent of the couples incur a tax for being married.
Moreover, the column (3) results suggest that the size of this tax

can be quite substantial.

The average value in the $100,000-

$200,000 range is $2,634, and above that it is $9,980. The figures
near the bottom of columns (2) and (3) indicate that 52 percent of
all couples will pay a positive marriage tax under 08RA93, and its

average will be about $1,244.

Relative to the old law, the

percentage of the population paying a marriage tax is just about
the same, but the magnitude of the tax is about $350 higher under
the new law.
The figures in columns (4) and (5) indicate that under OBRA93,

about 38 percent of the couples will receive a marriage subsidy,
and the average value of this subsidy will be about $1,399. Under

the old law, the conditional subsidy was about $1,577.

A thought suggested by our discussion so far is that under
both the old and new laws the dispersion of the marriage tax is

substantial. To get a handle on this issue, we computed the

13

standard deviation of the marriage tax for all returns within each

AGI bracket. The results are reported in column (6) of Table 3.
The first thing to note about these numbers is that they are large
relative to the size of the average marriage tax. For example, for

the sample as a whole, the standard deviation of $1,579 is more

than 10 times the average value of $124.

Second, OBRA93 has

decreased the dispersion of the marriage tax somewhat —— the
standard deviation under the previous law was $1978.
One possible problem with these results arises from the nature

of the sample, which consists of only joint returns. Such a sample

allows us to learn about the tax consequences of a divorce for
already married couples, but the tax consequences of marriage for

unmarried persons are missing from the picture.

Attempts to

simulate the tax consequences of marriage for the unmarried come up
against the difficulty of choosing a potential mate for each single

person. As far as we know, no representative.dataset includes
information on this subject. However, we found one database that

may allow us to glean at least some insights, the National.
Longitudinal Survey Mother-Child database. For each individual in

the sample, the survey reports whether she has a spouse or a
"partner". The universe is mothers aged 25 to 33 in 1990, but the

income information is for 1989. The income information is much

less rich than in TAXSIM ——

all

that is available is wages

(including military pay) and self-employment income. There are no
data on dividends and interest, but we would not expect capital to

be an important component of income for this sample.

14

Our goal is to compare the consequences of marriage on the

joint tax liabilities of cohabiting couples with the tax
consequences of divorce for married couples. To make the results
as comparable as possible to those in Table 3, we "aged" the data

to 1994 levels, and applied the 1994 tax law.'0 The results are
reported in Table 4. The first three lines of the table provide
some summary

information

about the married and cohabiting samples.

There are many more married than cohabiting couples in the data,
and the married couples have substantially higher joint incomes ——

$49,840 versus $31,422. The mean marriage tax for the married
couples is $556; the mean tax that the cohabiting couples would

face if they married is $229. However, the differences are not
statistically significant.

The percentage of the cohabiting couples who would face a

marriage tax (38 percent) is low relative to that of married
couples (62 percent). The difference is not attributable to the
fact that the cohabiting couples are more likely to face marriage

subsidies; 34 percent of the married face a subsidy versus 37
percent for the cohabitors. Rather, the difference arises because
so many of the cohabitors face no marriage tax at all. This is due

to the fact that many are on welfare, and have zero AGIs.
Interestingly, conditional on facing a marriage tax or subsidy, the

magnitudes are roughly similar for the two groups —— the
conditional mean marriage taxes differ by only $133, and the
conditional mean subsidies by $284. Taking this fact together with

the observation that the incidence of cohabiting couples is

15

relatively quite small in the population, we tentatively conclude

that ignoring cohabiting couples does not substantially bias our
results.

But clearly this is an issue that warrants further

research.

4. Conclusion
The changes in the rate schedules and earned income tax credit

embodied in the new tax law have implications for the tax
consequences of marriage. On average, the income tax now imposes
a mild tax on marriage of $124, while under the previous law there

was a small subsidy of $143. However, the small average figure
conceals the fact that some families will be paying substantial
taxes or receiving substantial subsidies for being married.

In

1994, about 52 percent of U.S. families will pay an average
marriage tax of $1,244. This corresponds to a total of about $33
billion. At the same time, about 38 percent of the families will

receive a marriage subsidy averaging $1,399 per family; the
aggregate amount will be about $27 billion.
Our results lead naturally to the question of whether the new

marriage tax will affect people's behavior."

As we showed

earlier, at least for some low income couples, the size of the

marriage tax is now quite extraordinary, amounting to over 18
percent of total income. An interesting topic for future research
will be to see if the incidence of joint filing diminishes in this

group. In this context, it is important to note that a reduction
in joint filing is not the same thing as a reduction in marriage.

It is costly and difficult for the Internal Revenue Service to

16

learn about taxpayers' family situations. One possible response to
huge marriage taxes may be that taxpayers will simply not reveal to

the I.R.S. that they are married.

Actual marginal tax rates may be higher due to the personal

For further analysis of the EITC, see Scholz (1993) and

Browning [1993). OBRA93 substantially increased the EITC. Under
previous law, for example, the maximum credit for a family with two
children would have been only $2,015, as opposed to the $2,528 in
the table.

5. By the "old law" we mean the 1992 law as it would have looked
in 1994 after the bracket widths, standard deductions and personal
exemptions were indexed for inflation in the intervening years.

More extreme cases can be illustrated, but they probably
correspond to unlikely family situations. For example, consider
two individuals each of whom has two children and each of whom
earns $13,616. The marriage tax in this case is $5,875, about 21
percent of pre—tax income.
6.

For these very high income couples, the marriage tax is
independent of the number of children because all the personal

exemptions are phased out.

TAXSIM.

In the absence of information on itemized deductions, we

assume that all returns used a standard deduction.

distorts behavior, it induces a welfare loss that exceeds revenues
collected.
