A SEMI-CLASSICAL MODEL
OF PRICE LEVEL ADJUSTMENT

ABSTRACF

This paper investigates the theoretical and empirical properties of & model of aggregate

supply behavior that was introduced in the 1970s but has received inadequate attention. The
model postulates that price changes occur so as to gradually eliminate discrepancies between
actual and market-clearing values and to reflect expected changes in market-clearing values. Its

implications are more "classical' than most alternative formulations that reflect gradual price
adjustment Empirical results, which utilize a proxy for market-clearing output that is a function
of fixed capital and the real price of oil, are modemtely encouraging but not entirely supportive.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the theoretical and
empirical properties of one particular model of aggregate supply behavior
that has not, in my opinion, attracted the attention that it deserves. The
model in question features price level stickiness——i.e., gradual adjustment

nevertheless

has

several

"classical"

characteristics. Its specification was first proposed by Grossman (1974) but

was more prominently introduced by Barro and Grossman (1976).

Shortly

thereafter it was independently conceived and more formally justified by
Mussa (1977, 1981a, 1981b, 1982), and was used as the centerpiece of a number

of papers by myself.t This model——which I will call the P—bar model—-has
never been the subject of extensive empirical study, however, and has almost
disappeared from the literature in recent years.

In the following sections it will be suggested that recent neglect of

the P—bar model Is unwarranted.

In particular, I will argue that its

theoretical properties are more satisfactory than those of some leading

operational models of aggregate supply——here attention will be focused
especially on the formulations of Taylor (1979, 1980, 1993) and Fuhrer and

Moore (1993a. 1993b)——and that its empirical performance is reasonably
satisfactory.

There is a problem relating to the implied time series

properties of capacity output, but essentially the same flaw pertains to the
other models under discussion, as well.

Throughout, the perspective of the

analysis will be that of a macroeconomic researcher whose concern is the
development of a compact quarterly econometric model that has reasonable
theoretical properties and is empirically consistent with the postwar U.S.
data,

The outline of the paper is a follows.

models is presented, with Section IV being devoted primarily to the model of
Fuhrer and Moore. Empirical analysis with quarterly U. S. data for 1954—1990
is developed in Section V.

A few- theoretical issues are then discussed in

Section VI and a brief conclusion follows.

II. Basic Description of the P—Bar Model
The

F—bar model of aggregate supply shares the assumption of most

econometric models that prices adjust to shocks incompletely,

within each

period, with output being determined by the quantity demanded at the
resulting price level. This particular model's distinguishing characteristic
is that the determination of each period's price level depends upon movements

of the hypothetical price level that would, given prevailing conditions, make

output equal to its capacity value. Let Pt and y denote logarithms of the

The constant of proportionality relating Ti and ; will depend,

obviously, on the properties of the model's aggregate demand relations.

Which of these two formulations, (1) or (2), should be considered more
nearly structural?

The answer to that question depends upon the analysis

used to justify the implied type of price setting behavior. Mussa (198ib)
bases his argument on profit maximization calculations made in the face of
lump—sum price adjustment costs with averaging across individual firms, an
approach which gives rise to (1).2 My own preferred rationale presumes that

prices must be set at the start of the period in which they will apply and

that production will equal whatever quantity is demanded.3

One basic

assumption is that it is costly, in terms of real resources, for producers to

make between—period changes in output relative to capacity.4 But it is also

costly, of course, for output to differ from its capacity level.

Thus if

these two cost components are quadratic, the producer will set a price that

is expected to yield a magnitude of demand (and output) that is dependent

both on

formulation (2) is the more basic and more nearly structural.5
In terms of its superficial appearance, the adjustment specification (2)

looks much like a typical expectational Phillips relation of the i9lOs.
There are two significant differences, however, that should be noted. First,

the "expected inflation" term pertains to changes in the market—clearing

to changes in Pt itself. Second, the output gap term pertains
to the previous period's discrepancy between Yt and , not the value for the
current period. As a consequence, the mode of behavior represented by (2)

makes Pt an entirely predetermined variable.

That raises some issues that

will be addressed momentarily, but first it should be noted that the
interaction of these two unusual features is itself quite significant.

But that means that the specification with E_,Ap

cannot be used, given the assumption of rational expectations, to yield a
model in which output fluctuates relative to capacity.6

What about the property of Pt being entirely predetermined?

practice, one would presumably want to add a stochastic disturbance term to

would,

But that would not alter the important properties of

however, be possible. Specifically, one could regard the magnitude of

Pt determined by (2) as a planned value, which might be altered within period

t in response to the occurrence of conditions significantly different than
those previously expected.

Indeed, one might interpret the non—dynamic

TMprice stickiness" models of Hankiw (1985) or Ball and Romer (1990) as

pertaining

to this latter form of adjustment. Recognizing such adjustments

would, interestingly, make the model one with a reduced degree of price
stickiness relative to the P—bar formulation (2). Since a major theme of our

4

discussion will be the rather "classical' nature of the P—bar model——i.e.,

its similarity in several respects to models with perfectly flexible
prices——it will strengthen the argument7 to exclude within—period adjustments

of the Hankiw—Ball—Romer type. Accordingly, all of the discussion below will

be based on equation (2) rather than an extended model that includes such
adjustments.

A closely related issue involves the role of inventories, briefly
mentioned in In. 4.

A producer that holds a stock of finished goods has

available a third way of responding to shocks, in addition to output and
price adjustments.

Incorporating inventory holdings into our model would

therefore serve to make it more flexible. But since we are emphasizing the

classical properties of systems including (a), our argument will again be
strengthened by abstracting from these extra features.8

From its definition, it is clear that one can obtain an explicit

only after adoption of a

expression for the market clearing price
specification regarding aggregate demand.

In my previous work, the demand

specification typically used was9

just—mentioned problems are quite important with respect to
concerning the famous or infamous "policy ineffectiveness

proposition"

that played a prominent role in my 1979 and 1980 papers.

It is

so that it is only the surprise component of monetary policy that affects Yt

any policy feedback rule that bases the systematic part of mt

entirely on variables from period t—1 and before.

Thus the policy

ineffectiveness proposition will hold in this case. But it will not hold if

the demand schedule includes Ep.1 or any other variable Zt for which the
behavior of Zt —

E_,z

is affected by the policy rule.13 So this proposition

should not be regarded as a general implication of the P—bar model.
For

illustrative purposes,

however——and possibly as a useful

approximation——let us provisionally adopt (4) as an AD specification.14 Then

we

write

Thus we see that to determine the time series properties of Apt, it will be
necessary to adopt some assumption about the processes generating Am and Yt.

Granger's Lemma shows the right hand side of (20) to be a HA(2) process, so

we have found the Inflation rate to be an AB}tA(2.2) process from the
univariate perspective.

Clearly, therefore, there are many parameter values

for 0 and gi, that will imply a great deal of inflation persistence.

Next it will be appropriate to demonstrate explicitly that——as mentioned

above——the policy ineffectiveness proposition does not apply when Ep
appears in the AD function, For this demonstration let us write the system

said, that output could be kept Dermanently high (relative to its natural

rate or capacity value) by any pattern of behavior of the monetary
authorities. And yet it is the case that almost all empirical models of
aggregate supply——i.e., wage—price specifications in econometric models——fail

to satisfy the natural rate hypothesis. That this is true for specifications

involving the concept of a NAIRU (non—accelerating inflation rate of

Of more interest, perhaps, is the situation with regard to the
wage—price specification, involving overlapping nominal contracts, of John
Taylor ((1979, 1980, i993).

This specification is well—known not only from

Taylor's own work, but also from its use in econometric models developed and
utilized by other researchers (including Gagnon and Tryon (1993) and Hasson,

Symansky, and Meredith (1990) in the MX3 and Multimod models).

In fact, I

think it is fair to say that it is currently the leading model of aggregate
supply among researchers using estimated econometric models.

A two—period version of Taylor's setup can be used to develop the points

10

at issue. Let Pt be the aggregate price (or wage) index——in log terms——which
is an average of the (log) contract prices negotiated in the current and most
recent periods, x, and xt,:

(30)

0.5 (xt +

Pt

Contract prices are set by half of the sellers in period t to keep in step
with prices pertaining to the other half of the sellers, with an adjustment
added to reflect the effects of excess demand (current and expected):

But from the latter we can see that a policy that keeps àx greater than
ax,. will keep Yt —

Yt below zero, on average, if expectations are rational.

Thus the Taylor model does not have the natural rate property. It predicts.

however, that an accelerating inflation will keep output low——not high, as
with the NAIRIJ model.

Quite recently, Fuhrer and Moore (1993a, i993b) have developed an
aggregate supply specification that can be viewed as a revised version of the

Taylor model.

Their work suggests that this specification has both

theoretical and empirical properties that make it preferable to its
predecessor.

The Fuhrer—Hoore analysis of aggregate supply is developed.

however, in the context of a small econometric model whose framework differs
from the one presented above, and which does so in an interesting way. Their
papers also present the empirical properties of their model in an unorthodox
yet interesting fashion.

Accordingly, it will be desirable to devote an

entire section to the discussion of the Fuhrer—Moore analysis.

This

constitutes something of a digression, but is useful in preparing the scene

ii

for our empirical analysis of the P—bar model by emphasizing the importance

of inflation—rate persistence and the use of autocorrelation functions to
summarize a model's empirical performance. Readers who dislike digressions
could, nevertheless, skip directly to Section V.

F&M's IS specification, with a second lagged y, term here

deleted for clarity.

Equation (37) is the model's monetary policy rule, in

which it is presumed that the short—term interest rate is used as the policy
instrument.

And, finally, equations (36) describe the aggregate supply sector that
constitutes a variation on Taylor.22 The authors' apparent rationale is that

Taylor's formula (31) describing contract price determination is replaced
with one in which the nominal price of each sector's output is set so as to

equate its relative price, Xt — Pt'

to the average of the other sector's

expected relative prices over the life of the contract, with an adjustment
(as in Taylor) for current and expected values of .

which shows that contract price inflation is an average of its own past and
expected future values, plus a cyclical adjustment term that will be small
empirically, and is therefore sticky.

In Taylor's setup, by contrast, we

have a similar expression but with contract prices (xt) in place of inflation

rates (Ax). Furthermore, with sticky inflation, the F&H model can be shown
to match some important features of the U.S. data with much greater accuracy,
as we shall see shortly.

Ky first impression was that the F&H specification also had the
advantage

of conforming to the natural rate hypothesis. And it is true that

cannot be kept permanently away from zero by a constant acceleration, as

in the Taylor case

discussed above. This can be seen

by Inspection of (39).

But that relation can be rearranged as follows, with E(•) operators deleted:

From the latter it is clear that an ever—increasing acceleration of
inflation, with Mx growing over time, will keep the average value of
permanently low. So my first impression was incorrect; the F&I4 specification

actually does not satisfy the strict, Lucas (1972) version of the natural

rate hypothesis——and this remains true in the slightly more complicated
version that is actually used in their papers.

Nevertheless, I find the F&il specification quite interesting and worthy

of additional consideration.

The same might be said, moreover, for their

Given that
The monetary

authority's actions in (37) are changes in short—term interest rates.24 These

affect the long—term real rate via (34) and its value feeds into the
determination of real aggregate demand in (35).

Then demand—induced

movements in output affect price determination in the block (36a) —

(36c).

That description is overly simplified, because it exaggerates the model's
recursiveness, but is not seriously misleading. A crucial point is that the
system hangs together and permits monetary policy actions to affect

property of the model, it is rather disturbing that the estimated value of 6
in P8.11 (1993b) Is only 0.007 with a standard error of 0.004.

Be that as it may, let us consider the fact that no money demand
equation is included. Of course one——similar to our (4), for example——could
be added to the model, in which case it would determine the quantity of money

that the monetary authority has to (elastically) supply to conduct its
interest—rate—centered policy.

But the properties of that money demand

It would be entirely reasonable to wonder about the neglect of fiscal
policy variables in the aggregate demand relation (4).

Indeed, the rate of

government purchases would be expected to enter in the IS relation (5) and
therefore in (4) even if the economy were one in which Ricardian equivalence
prevailed.

Accordingly, estimates were obtained for versions of the

relations appearing in columns one and three of Table 2 but with Ag and
tg_1 also included, g being the log of state, local, and federal government
purchases.

In column one, the estimated parameter values (standard errors)

are 0.094 (.054) and —0,097(.055) and for column three the corresponding
figures are almost exactly the same.

In both cases, the hypothesis that the

tg terms jointly provide no explanatory power cannot be rejected at the 0.05

significance level. Consequently, it seems unlikely tht our omission of the

government spending variables, which was adopted in Section II to keep the
model clean and simple, is a significant flaw.

version of the P—bar model is a policy rule for the generation of £m. For

Simply for the sake of comparison, consider also a version of (53)
estimated with yt-i defined relative to a deterministic trend.

In this case,

the coefficient on that variable rises to 0.066 (.012) and the one attached
to E..1Ain falls to 0.456 (.074).

In addition, when an equation explaining

hp with four lagged values of itself and our preferred measure of y..1 is
estimated, the coefficient on the latter remains significantly positive and
residual autocorrelation is eliminated.M

In principle, it would be interesting to use the estimated model to
explore the system's autocorrelation structure in the manner of Fuhrer and
Moore.

A direct comparison with the F&H results would not be appropriate,

however, because of three differences between their estimated system and
ours.

These are: (1) Different monetary policy instruments are used. (ii)

VI. Theoretical Issues
Before concluding, we need to briefly consider a few theoretical issues
concerning the specification of the P—bar model. The first of these pertains

to an apparent distinction between the Barro—Grossman (1976) and Mussa
(i981a, 1981b) versions of the P—bar variable——a distinction that is the
principal topic of a paper by Obstfeld and Rogoff (1984). Using

to denote

the Barro-'Grossman concept, Obstfeld and Rogoff state that "The difference
between p and

deserves emphasis. p is the output price that would prevail

in a hypothetical Walrasian general equilibrium with fully flexible prices

Iwhereasl p is the output price that would clear the goods market given
current levels of the sticky—price system's endogenous variables" (1984. p.
164).

By contrast, McCallum (1979, p.

1; 1980, p. 733) evidently sees no

important difference in the two specifications.

His reasoning is,

presumably, as follows.

In a typical application, the only feature of the model that keeps it

from being one of the Wairasian type, with fully flexible prices, is the

sticky—price adjustment mechanism under consideration.

The system's

endogenous variables will differ from their Walrasian equilibrium values.
then, only to the extent that the prevailing price level Pt differs from Pt'

In a linear system, furthermore, the difference Zt —

between the

prevailing arid Walrasian values of any variable z will be proportionate to Pt
—

Pt'

But Pt — Pt will therefore be some linear combination of variables

each of which is proportional to Pt — Pt'
proportional

to Pt — Pt'

5° Pt —

t

will itself be

In this sense, then, there is no significant

operational distinction between Pt and

if the model being utilized is

linear.

The foregoing line of reasoning is consistent, it should be noted, with

the main result derived by Obstfeld and Rogoff (i984), who utilize a linear
system.

Specifically, the Obstfeld—Rogoff theorem involving their equation

(13) asserts that the Barro—Grossman and Hussa schemes "yield structurally
equivalent.. .

models" when the slope in the Barro—Grossman adjustment rule is

not too large (1984, p. i65).

But, furthermore, when the Barro—Grossman

price adjustment mechanism is interpreted properly," that slope condition
always holds and the "apparent convergence problem disappears" (1984. p.
166).

The second theoretical issue to be considered pertains to the
specification of Pt Hussa (1981a, 198ib) and Obstfeld—Rogoff (1984) both
work In continuous—time settings, and the latter authors use35 a definition of
Pt that would, in our (a)(4) setup of Section II, imply that

Here the expectation of• Pt+i — Pt

appears on the

right—hand side (rhs), instead of the expectation of Pt+i, and the rhs
denominator is correspondingly affected.

The idea, evidently, is that the

inflation rate is a variable that is independent of the current price level.

But while the price level and the inflation rate are certainly conceptually

distinct, it is not clear that they should be treated as statistically

VI. Conclusions
In the foregoing sections we have explored the P—bar model of

32

price

level adjustment, which postulates that price changes occur so as to (I)
gradually eliminate discrepancies between actual and market—clearing values

and to (ii) reflect expected changes in market—clearing values themselves.
This model has implications that are more "classical" than most alternative

formulations that reflect gradual price adjustment; in particular,

it

satisfies the natural rate hypothesis. With some informational structures it

will also satisfy the policy ineffectiveness proposition, but such a result
does not hold in general and can not be presumed.

Empirical implementation is hampered by the absence of any reliable
measure of the economy's market clearing or natural—rate value of output.
Also, accurate implementation requires accurate specification and estimation

of the economy's aggregate demand behavior. A set of results is developed,

nevertheless, utilizing a proxy for market—clearing output that is a
log—linear function of a measure of fixed capital and the real price of oil.

The results are moderately encouraging but not entirely supportive.

Two

highly positive aspects of the results are that they Ci) indicate a plausible

rate of price level adjustment in response to recent output levels and Cii)
imply an effect of expected money growth that is consistent with the model.
The

P—bar model's properties are compared with those of a specification

recently proposed by Fuhrer and Moore (i993a, i993b).

The latter does not

satisfy the natural rate hypothesis but appears to perform very well
empirically.

That last conclusion rests, however, on analysis that

questionably treats the market—clearing output rate as a deterministic trend.

than output alone, to reflect the presumption that such costs would not be

But they would not have

major effects on the properties of the model.

Thus we are implicitly omitting any "real—balance" term from the IS function
for simplicity. It will, however, be argued below in Section IV that such an
omission is theoretically inappropriate.

That is the

empirical relationship between the short—term nominal rate of interest and
the long—term

rate of interest that is the central topic in Fubrer and

Moore (1993b).

What they find is that these two variables have moved

together quite closely over the 1965—1990 time period, a correlation that

they note is in theory dependent upon the manner in which policy is
conducted.

31For observations since 1966, the nominal price is obtained as the ratio of

nominal to real imports of petroleum products as reported in the National
Income and Product Accounts. For 1954—1966, the Producer Price Index (i.e..

WPI) series for crude petroleum was spliced on. Then quarterly averages of

monthly observations were calculated.

The complete series was finally

time of the conference, Jeff Fuhrer pointed out that

the estimated

version (54) of the P—bar price adjustment equation does not satisfy the NW!.

That is true, as can be seen by setting Ay..i —

in (54), but

only because the estimated equation (17) omits the term 82 (E_1 Pt+' —

Et_2pt) that Is part of the model.

The reason for this omission is that

identification of the term seems almost hopeless, given the different
Information sets relevant to the two expectations. Thus the omission must be

judged a weakness of the paper's empirical work, but does not reflect any
discredit on the P—bar theory.
