DOWNSIZING AND PRODUCTIVITY
GROWI'H: MYTH OR REALITY?

ABSTRACT
The conventional wisdom is that the rising productivity in the U.S. manufacturing sector
in the 1980s has been driven by the apparently pervasive downsizing over this period. Aggregate
evidence clearly shows falling employment accompanying the rise in productivity. In this paper,

we examine the microcconomjc evidence using the plant level data from the Longitudinal
Reseaith Database (LRD). In contrast to the conventional wisdom, we find that plants that
increased employment as well as productivity contribute almost as much to overall productivity

growth in the 1980s as the plants that increased productivity at the expense of employment.
Further, there are striking differences by sector (defined by industry, size, region, wages, and

ownership type) in the allocation of plants in terms of whether they upsize or downsize and
whether they increase or decrease productivity. Nevertheless, in spite of the striking differences
across sectors defined in a variety of ways, most of the variance of productivity and employment

growth is accounted for by idiosyncratic factors.

I. INTRODUCTION
Productivity growth in the manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy has been rapid over
the past decade, and has been accompanied by a substantial reduction in employment. This
has engendered the conventional belief that rising productivity in manufacturing and decreasing
eml)loylnent. are inextricably linked through some micro-economic mechanisms. Some hold the
view that technological progress leads to layoffs because of mismatches between newly desired

labor quality and the skills of existing workers, or because of rigidities in wages and prices (for
a recent review, see Johnson (1994)). Others hold the alternative view that productivity growth

happens as a result of downsizing, or re-engineering, with its concomitant layoffs. Large scale
employment reductions by major companies are routinely reported in the media as part of this
downsizing trend, and applauded by market analysts for improving productivity and making the
company "lean and mean." The expansion of international trade is often seen as a source of the
competitive pressure that has lead to downsizing.

The conventional wisdom that productivity growth and downsizing are connected has some
basis in fact. Figure la depicts annual output and employment for the period 1958-89 for the totai

manufacturing sector and Figure lb depicts the annual growth rate in labor productivity over this
time. During the 1960s and t970s, output and employment fluctuated cyclically around a growing
trend with modest growth in productivity. In the 1980s, the pattern changed with output recovering
robustly from the recession in the early 1980s and employment never fully recovering. Consequently.

average labor productivity rose sharply over much of this period. We focus on this period of rising
productivity and falling employment using plant level data for the Census of Manufactures in 1977

and 1987. Over this interval, total employment in manufacturing establishments fell by 45 percent
over the period 1977 to 1987 even as productivity (measured by value added per worker) rose by

33 percent.' Thus, it would appear that our sample of plant level data is consistent with the
conventional wisdom.
'Manufacturing employment as we describe it here is based upon the Censuses and Surveys of Manufacturing
Establishments. Household surveys show that manufacturing employment has been pretty much flat over the last
twenty years. barring cyclical downturns. The difference in the conclusions arises because RD and head office
employees based on so-called "auxiliary establishments' are not included in the establishment data.

It turns out, however, that it is quite misleading to draw inferences from these aggregate data

to characterize what has been happening at the micro level to individual plants. Daily, liulten.
and Campbell (1992) and Barteisman and Dhrymes (1992) describe the effects that composition

changes have on the translation of plant level productivity to aggregate productivity behavior.
They find that growth in aggregate Total Factor Productivity is mostly the result of changes in
output. shares between plants, rather than within plant increases in TFP.
Another related example of the pitfalls of relying on aggregate data can be found in Davis and
Haltiwanger (1990). As shown in figure 2, the mean establishment size (as measured by published

total manufacturing employment divided by total number of establishments) fell from 58 workers
in 1977 to less than 50 workers in 1987. This fact, based on aggregate data, seemingly provides
evidence of significant downsizing over this period. However, the size distribution of plants is very

skewed—while the typical plant is small, the typical worker works for a large plant. Davis and
Haltiwanger define a summary statistic denoted the coworker mean, which is the employmentweighted average size of an establishment and thus represents the size of the plant for the typical
worker.2 The coworker mean is more than an order of magnitude larger than the mean plant size;

the typical manufacturing worker in 1987 is employed at a plant with more than 1700 employees.

More telling for our story is that the coworker mean, shown on the right axis of figure 2, fell in
the late 1960s and early 70s, before the full impact of international trade was felt, It actually has
increased slightly from 1977 to 1987.

The finding that the size of the establishment for the typical worker has not declined in recent

years is striking in light of the conventional wisdom on downsizing. This turns out to be just the
first glimpse of the noisy, complex process of employment, output and productivity growth at the
plant level. Recent work using plant level data (e.g., Davis and Haltiwanger (1990, 1992), Dunne,

Roberts and Samuelson (1989), Daily, Campbell and Hulten (1992), Bartelsman and Dhrymes
(1992), Baldwin and Goreckj (1990, 1991)) present a picture of a disperse distribution of output.

nature of the size distribution. In the terminology of Hart. the coworker mean is the ratio of the second moment to

have learned from this work that when the aggregate economy grows, for example, this is accounted

for by some plants growing and others contracting with the gross rates of change very large relative

to the net change. This paper continues in that tradition with a focus on the connection between
employment growth and productivity growth at the plant level and the associated implications for
aggregate employment and productivity growth.

As with prior studies, we find there is substantial heterogeneity among plants and industries.
While layoffs often receive more publicity than do employment increases, there are in fact many
manufacturing establishments where productivity growth accompanies increases in employment.

Overall, plants that added workers contribute about the same to aggregate productivity as plants
that downsized. Similarly, while downsizing is associated with increases in productivity, there are

in fact many establishments where a reduction in employment accompanies productivity losses.
Further, there are striking differences by sector (defined by industry, size, region and ownership

type) in the allocation of plants in terms of whether they upsize or downsize and whether they
increase or decrease productivity. While the detailed industry, region, size, ownership type and

wage characteristics of plants do provide statistically significant information on the probability

that a given plant is a downsizing productivity gainer, we find that most of the cross-sectional
variance of productivity and employment growth rates cannot be explained by observable plant
characteristics. Thus, the allocation of plants in terms of whether they upsize or downsize. increase

or decrease productivity is largely driven by idiosyncratic factors.

II. THE DATA
Our primary dataset consists of all manufacturing plants that were in operation in both 1977
and 1987 as reported to the Censuses of Manufacturers (the "continuers"). There are about 140,000

such plants. We will also present some information about those plants that were in operation in

1977, but that had shut down by 1987 (the "exiters"); and also for the new plants that started
between 1977 and 1987 (the "entrants"). Because of the difficulty of matching plant identification

numbers there is some error in allocating plants to the continuers, exiters and entrants, but we
believe that this error is small.3
3Davis and Haltiwanger and Schuh (1994) describe the methodology for using the coverage code information in

In our investigation, we consider both gross output and value added based measures of labor
prodictivity. Gross output for our plants is measured as shipments adjusted for inventories, deflated

by the 4-digit deflator for the industry in which the plant is classified. Labor input is the total
employment of the plant and labor productivity, using the gross output method, is the ratio of the

two. Value added is constructed for our plants by subtracting the real cost of materials front the
gross output measure. The teal cost of materials is measured as the dollar cost of materials deflated

by a 4-digit material deflator. The value added measure of labor productivity is accordingly the
ratio of plant level value added to plant level employment. In all cases, the results are reported in
terms of 1982 dollars. We specifically chose the midpoint of our sample to minimize the distortions
associated with using a fixed weight price index in this context.4 Most of our results are presented

in terms of the value added measure of labor productivity. We do this for a number of reasons.
First, this is the conceptually preferable measure of labor productivity. Second, in spite of concerns
about measurement errOr in both the plant level materials data as well as in the materials deflators,

we find that the results are very similar with the gross output based measure.5
There are a number of relevant measurement concerns given our data and methodology that
should be noted in interpreting our results. First, even for our value added based measure, we do

not include the effect of purchased services. This is a concern since there is some evidence that
the manufacturing sector has increased its outsourcing, particularly its purchases of services; our

value added measure will capture increased outsourcing if it is the form of intermediate physical

inputs but will not capture changes in the role of purchased services. In addition, our labor
measure—establishment level employment—neglects employees in auxiliary establishments such as

head-office and R&D fadlities. Note that Siegel and Griliches (1991) investigate the role of both of
these measurement issues and conclude that they do not have much of an effect on the measurement

of manufacturing productivity for the period 1977-82 (one half of our sample period). This provides
some reassurance that these measurement concerns are not likely to have a serious impact on our
the plant level data to clean up residual matching problems in the LRD. In this work we match solely on the ba.sis
of Census permanent plant number (ppn).
4ln an earlier version of this paper, we used 1977 as a base year. This yields a higher growth rate of output
and productivity since doing so overstates the contribution to real output of industries with declining relative prices,
especially for computers.

We report some of the key results using both methods to verify this claim.

results.

We recognize as well that our focus on labor productivity rather than total factor productivity
affects the interpretation of our results. The role of capital deepening and biases in technical change

cannot be well understood by the behavior of labor productivity alone; for example, investments in

labor saving equipment which increase labor productivity may not be successful from a TFP point

of view.

Table 1 gives summary statistics of productivity, employment and output for all of manufacturing, for our primary sample of 140,000 continuing plants, and for the exiters and entrants. The

results in Table 1 are based on the value added measure and are restricted to plants with positive value added and materials purchases in the relevant years for the different types of plants

(e.g., continuers must have positive value added in both years). We see that productivity grew
by 38.7 percent for the sector as a whole for the ten year period, while the continuers had productivity growth of 33.9 percent.6 It follows that the plants that entered between 1977 and 1987
had lower average labor productivity than the plants that exited. Plant turnover thus has a small

net negative effect on productivity (there is a small net positive effect when productivity is cal-

culat.ed from gross output). As seen, the labor productivity of exiters was substantially lower
than that of the continuers, while it was not the case that entrants came in at higher than average productivity—consistent with the findings of Bartelsman and Dhrymes (1992). Decomposing

the relative contribution of continuing plants and net entry, the increased productivity of the net
entrants accounts for approximately 30% of the overall increase in productivity from 1977-87.
As shown in table 1, manufacturing employment declined by 0.45 per year.8 Our main sample of

continuers accounted for employment of 12.8 million in 1977 and (somewhat surprisingly perhaps)

had just a small loss of 98,000 employees by 1987. Job destruction among the continuers thus
has been almost fully offset by job creation by this same group (the job loss is only 30,000 if the
'The figures reported in the table are the average growth over 10 years (cumulative growth divided by 10) rather
than the annualized growth rate. We use this average growth measure in all of our tables so that our decompositions
add up properly. The implied annual growth rate for productivity is 2.85 perceclt.
Tlnterestingly, the contribution of net entry falls to 20% if industry 357 (computing equipment) is excluded from
the calculation.

come about primarily from layoffs at plants that were closed which were not fully offset by hires at
new plants.

The rate of output growth has been about the same in the continuers as in the whole sector. As

a group, the continuers are consistent with the conventional wisdom — rapid output growth. mild

employment contraction, and rapid productivity growth.9

III. PRODUCTIVITY AND EMPLOYMENT QUADRANTS
In the remainder of this paper we concentrate on the continuing plants. We have divided these
continuing plants in our sample into four groups or quadrants, as illustrated in Figure 4. Quadrant 1

consists of the "successful upsizers," plants that were able to increase both labor productivity and
employment. Quadrant 2 are the "successful downsizers," the plants that raised productivity but

did so by reducing employment. Quadrant 3 are the "unsuccessful downsizers," the plants that
faced

reductions in both productivity and employment. Finally, the quadrant 4 plants are the

unsuccessful upsizers, the plants that raised employment but at the expense of productivity.
Figure 5 shows the average annual percentage change in labor productivity, employment, and

output for total manufacturing, and for the average plant in each quadrant. This figure illustrates clearly that productivity growth can occur by plants increasing or decreasing employment
(quadrants 1 and 2), and that layoffs do not necessarily lead to successful increases in productivity

(quadrants 2 and 3).
Plants can find themselves in quadrant 1 for a variety of reasons. First, the long run increase
in both labor productivity and employment is consistent with increased demand for its products
combined with increasing returns technology. Alternatively, these plants could have actually moved

their production frontier outward through technological innovation, while facing elastic product
demand.
9Shown in Table A.1 in the appendix

are

the summary staustics for the manufacturing sector excluding industry

357, computer equipment. This industry has shown extraordinary productivity growth captured by the rapidly
falling deflator for computer equipment. With this industry removed from the total, productivity increase drops
to 2.99 percent a year for the whole sector and to 2.89 percent for the continuers. Comparing these results to the
results for total manufacturing shows that 357 by itself has obviously accounted for a non-trivial share of the sectors
productivity increase. Note that the re'ative contribution of industry 357 is affected by the choice of the base year.
The relative contribution increases if 1977 is chosen as the base year and decreases if 1987 is chosen a.s the base ear,

The conventional wisdom about U.S. manufacturing over this period is captured in the quadrant 2 plants. These were the ones that raised productivity, but did so at the expense of jobs. This

pattern is consistent with technological innovation combined with either falling demand or very
inelastic demand (labor augmenting technical change is suggested in either case). If there were a

simple way to characterize the whole manufacturing sector, then we should find that the bulk of
manufacturing output and employment would be in plants in quadrant 2.
The employment and productivity behavior of plants in the third quadrant are consistent with
one of the following (i) falling demand and increasing returns to scale or (ii) negative productivity
shock and elastic demand or (iii) falling demand and incomplete adjustment of employment. Based

on this last interpretation, which we find the most plausible, we label these plants unsuccessful
downsizers.

The final group of plants are those where falling productivity and rising employment place them

in quadrant 4. The pattern here is consistent with a negative productivity shock and inelastic
demand, or rising demand and diminishing returns. Alternatively, these plants could have shifted
to lower quality employees, which could be observed by falling wages. We examine this hypothesis
below.

In Table 2 we show how the plants in our main group of 140.000 continuers break down into the
four quadrants using the value added measure of labor productivity. There are between one-quarter
and one-third of the plants in each of quadrants 1, 2, and 4. There are 14 percent of the plants in
quadrant 3.

Counting the number of plants may not be the most revealing way to see the relative importance

of each quadrant, however, and table 2 also shows the employment and output shares. We see that

the quadrant 1 and 2 plants make up the bulk of the sector in both employment and output. They
account for two thirds or more of the sector both in 1977 and 1987. The large number of somewhat

anomalous quadrant 4 plants are smaller than average.

The middle rows of the table give a decomposition for all the plants and for each quadrant
separately that indicates how much of the productivity growth reflects increases within individual
plants (the row labelled "productivity") and how much comes from mix effects (the rows labelled

"employment shares' and "cross terms"). Equation 1 shows the decomposition underlying these

13

three rows in the table.

The first mix term (labeled "empi. share") arises because of shifts in employment shares between

plants. This term is positive or negative depending upon whether the plants that areabove average

in productivity are increasing or decreasing their shares of employment.'1 The table shows that

for all plants together the term is positive, but very small. Within quadrants, this cross term is
negative for the plants in quadrant 1, but positive for those in qua.drants 2 and 3. It is essentially
zero for the plants in quadrant 4.

The second mix effect (the row labeled "cross term") is positive or negative depending upon
whether plants that have positive productivity growth have increasing or decreasing employment

shares, respectively, or vice-versa. This term is negative overall, indicating that plants that have

positive productivity growth do on average have decreasing employment. It alternates in sign
among the quadrants (as it must given their definitions) - the Quadrant 2 plants are dominating
the cross term.

Although there are non trivial mix effects shown in these data, it seems that a fair general
characterization of the results is that most of the overall increase in productivity and most of the
increase within each quadrant is accounted for by within plant changes. The changes in productivity

over the ten year period are not the result of mix effects. This finding is consistent with that
of Griliches and Regev (1992), who look at the decomposition of labor productivity in Israeli
manufacturing plants. Interestingly, it contrasts with the finding of Barteisman and Dhrymes
(1992) that TFP growth is mostly a restilt of mix shifts in the long run.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO OVERALL GROWTH BY QUADRANT

The bottom four rows of Table 2 treat each quadrant as a group and ask how much each

and 1987 is divided by 10 to

the overall growth. Quadrant 2 accounts for about. three-quarters of the overall growth. Thus.

these two quadrants together account for more than the total increase in productivity as their
contributions are offset by quadrants 3 and 4.

It is important to emphasize that each quadrant contributes not only through its own change
in productivity, but also because its share of employment is changing. Equation 2 shows how this
happens.

Given equation 2, we see that quadrant 1 plants contribute both by the rise in productivity at

each of these plants but also through the increased employment share (the positive cross term).
The contribution of quadrant 2 coming from rising productivity (holding employment shares fixed)

is higher than that of quadrant 1, even though the plants in these quadrants have about these
same productivity growth rates, on average. This is the result of the negalive impact of the falling
employment shares (shown by the negative cross term) in quadrant 2.

Quadrants 3 and 4 both contribute negatively to overall productivity. For quadrant 3, much
of this is due to decreases in productivity holding the employment share fixed. While this is an
important component for quadrant 4 as well, the increase in employment share combined with the

decrease in employment is also an important.contributing factor.'2

QUADRANT DECOMPOSITION USING GROSS OUTPUT MEASURE
The analogous results using the gross output measure are reported in Table 3. The results

are strikingly similar to those obtained using the value added measure. The shares of plants,
employment and output across quadrants are very similar across both measures. Of particular
121n the appendix Table A.2 we show the same calculation, but with the computer equipment industry removed
from the sample. The main impact is on the quadrant I plants. This group now contributes 188 percent rather than
2.18 percent to overall productivity growth.

interest is the fact that the share of plants in quadrant 4 is about the same with both measures of
labor productivity. Thus, it does not appear as if changes in the extent or nature of outsourcing is

an important factor in accounting for the somewhat anomalous plants in quadrant 4.

Broadly, the respective contributions of each of the quadrants to productivity growth and the
associated decompositions of these effects are also very similar with the gross output based measure.

The importance of quadrant 1 in accounting for the increase in productivity is slightly lower (about

61%) using the gross output measure, while the contribution of quadrant 2 is somewhat larger

(about 82%). Thus, corrections for changes in materials usage does lower the contribution of
successful downsizers somewhat which is consistent with a modest role for outsourcing in accounting

for the differences in results between Tables 2 and 33

IV. ALLOCATION OF PLANTS INTO QUADRANTS, BY SECTOR
'3Given the striking similarity in results in Tables 2 and 3, results in subsequent sections are reported only for the
value added measure. As with Tables 2 and 3, the subsequent results are very similar using either measure.

INDUSTRY AND PRODUCTIVITY
Table 4 presents the allocation of employment into quadrants (and the overall contribution to

growth) by industry. In Table 4 we show the division by 2-digit industry and in the appendix
describe results from the 3-digit break down. The first column of the table shows the contribution

of each industry to the overall productivity increase of 3.4 percent a year. By far the largest
contribution to overall productivity comes from industry 35 (non-electrical machinery) and within

this industry, it is 357 (office and computing equipment) that accounts for most of this. After
industry 35, the next largest and roughly equal contributions come from industry 36 (electrical and
electronic equipment) and industry 20 (food). Within this former industry it is 366 (communication
equipment and 367 (electronic components) that provide most of the positive impact. The growth of
the three industries 357, 366 and 367 reflects the electronics revolution. If these three were excluded

from the continuers, they would reduce the overall rate of productivity growth from 3.4 percent
a year to 2.6 percent a year. The contributions from industry 20 (food) are scattered among the
different three digit elements within this industry.

The remaining columns depict the allocation of employment by quadrant for each industry,
deviated from the total manufacturing shares. At the 2-Digit level industries 28 (chemicals). 29
(petroleum refining), 31 (leather goods) and particularly 33 (basic metals) are the ones that have

less than the average share in quadrant 1 and more than the average in quadrant 2 or 3I4 Thus,
the well-known downsizing in the steel industry with the shift towards mini-mills is reflected in

these results. Overall, these industries have many plants in mature products and have reduced
employment to increase productivity. However, generalizations by two-digit industry are difficult

to make since, as shown in the appendix, there is a wide variance of experience within the same
two-digit industry.

shares of their employment in quadrant 1 (successful upsizers), particularly the Pacific region. These

same regions had less than average fractions of employment in quadrant 2. The sunbelt regions thus

obviously were an important part of this upsizing, increasing productivity phenomenon. However,

it is striking that the New England region is disproportionately represented in this group as well.'5

PLANT SIZE AND PRODUCTIVITY
In table 6 we show the break down of the main sample by plant size, where this is measured by
average employment in 1977 and 1987.16 We find that the smallest plants did not contribute much

to overall growth. But after that, the contributions come from plants of a range of sizes with the
highest contribution coining from plants with 500-999 employees.
'The equivalent table excluding industry 357 shows that this surprising result on New England is not driven by the
computer equipment industry. That is, even excluding computer equipment, New England is still disproportionately
in quadrant 1.
"The use of average size to allocate plants into size classes is motivated by the findings in Davis, Haltiwa.nger and
Schub (1994). They show that regression to the mean fallacy problems arise in using a point in time measure of size
to allocate plants into size classes given the large transitory changes in employment that are present in the plant level

data.

Small plants are disproportionately in quadrant 4 (unsuccessful upsizers). The quadrant 2 plants

(successful downsizers) are disproportionately in the 500 to 4,999 size range. These are the plants

that have set the stereotype for what has happened to manufacturing over the period. Strikingly,
the very largest plants (over 5,000) have a larger than average fraction in quadrant 1 (successful

upsizers) and only a small fraction in quadrant 4 (unsuccessful upsizers). Thus, not only do the
upsizing, productivity gainers account for a large fraction of the aggregate productivity growth but
they are disproportionately represented by the largest plants.

These findings are striking in light of the conventional wisdom on the importance of small
businesses in the growth of the economy.'7 These results indicate that small businesses that did

add employment disproportionately were likely to decrease productivity. In contrast, very large
businesses that increased employment disproportionately were likely to increase productivity)8
"Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1993) do.cument the reasons why the claim that small businesses are the dominant
sources of job growth is inaccurate.
"There may be a host of factors underlying this results which deserve further investigation. For example, small

plants may be making unique products whose prices are not well captured by the 4 digit deflator. See also the
discussion of wages below.

WAGES AND PRODUCTIVITY
Table 7 presents the allocation of employment into quadrants (and the overall contribution to
growth) by quintiles of the level of plant real wages per worker in 1977 (in thousands of 1982 dollars

per year). Downsizing plants (quadrants 2 and 3) had the highest initial real wages. Unsuccessful.

upsizing plants (quadrant 4) had slightly lower initial real wages than did the quadrant 2 plants
while the successful, upsizing plants had the lowest average initial real wages.

Table 8 presents the same results by quintiles of the growth in plant real wages from 1977 to
1987,. The plants that increased productivity (successful upsizers and downsizers) had the highest
real wage growth, with the larger increases coming from the ones that increased employment. The
plants that experienced declines in productivity had reductions in real wages, with the larger decline

actually occurring in the plants that raised employment.
These results raise interesting questions about the relation among wages, employment and pro-

ductivity. The first possibility is that some of the wage changes observed may be associated with
changes in labor quality. Under this interpretation, successful upsizers may be adding more skilled
workers, successful downsizers retaining their higher skilled workers, unsuccessful downsizers re-

taining their less skilled workers, and unsuccessful upsizers adding less skilled workers A second

interpretation is that increases in the wages for certain types of workers may have led to capital/labor substitution, and vice versa for the plants with wage declines. A third possibility is rent

sharing. Those plants that increased productivity gave (or were forced to give) a fraction of that
increase to their workers. This would also lead to a positive relationship between the change in

wages and the change in productivity. We are not able in this paper to sort out these alternative
possibilities. We note, however, some suggestive points. First, the magnitudes of the wage changes

are much smaller than the productivity changes. If the average skill levels or the average capita]
labor ratios are changing these are only a part of the reason for the productivity changes. Similarly,

if rents are being shared, then only a small part of the productivity increases are being passed on
to labor (as we know from aggregate manufacturing wage data). A second finding that seems clear,

also, is that average wage increases are apparently not driven by the decision to expand employ.
ment. The largest wage increases came from the plants with the largest rate of employment decline.

One explanation of our findings that is consistent with other trends observed in manufacturing is
that skill-biased technical change has occurred in many (but not all) plants. Where it has occurred,

productivity has increased and at the same time there has been a relative shift in employment to
higher skilled workers (raising average wages). We hope to explore these results in future research

both for understanding the evolution of the distribution of productivity and the distribution of
22

wages.'9

CONTRIBUTION OF SECTORAL CHARACTERISTICS TO OVERALL VARIANCE

OF EMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY
Tables 4—8 show that there are striking differences across plants defined by industry, region,

size, and wage in the allocation of plants into the quadrants of productivity and employment
growth. In Table 9 we show the extent to which the characteristics of industry in 1977, region. size
class, ownership type (plants associated with single-unit vs. multi-unit companies) and initial wage

class can explain the variance of productivity change and employment change in the continuing
plants.2° This exercise should not be interpreted as yielding causal inferences but rather a sense
of the connection between observable plant characteristics and the distribution of employment and
productivity growth. The table shows the R2 statistics for regressions of the column variable on the

dummy variables specified in the rows. For example, the first entry in the first column shows that
only 3.1 percent of the variance of productivity growth is explained by two-digit industry dummy
variables. The fractions of the variance that can be explained by these variables is quite small. Even

when industry, region, size class, ownership type and initial wage class are simultaneously taken

into account, less than 15 percent of the overall variance in output and productivity is explained
by the observable characteristics.

The last four columns of the table show the extent to which these plant-level observables can
predict the allocation of plant employment into quadrants. While the explanatory power is relatively

(1993) and Hellerstein, Neumark and Troske finds a close association among between plant differences in productivity,
wages, and the skill mix of the workers at individual plants.
'°We do not consider the role of plant real wage growth in this context given the obvious endogeneity problems. We
are treating the other observables as capturing exogenous characteristics or at least initial/predetermined conditions.
Concerns about endogerteity are nevertheless relevant for the size class measure given that it represents the average
size in 1977 and 1987. As discussed in lootnote 16, the use of the average size rather than initial size is motivated by
the results of Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1994). For this purpose, a preferable method might be the average size
in 1972 and 1977 since this would mitigate the transitory component problem. However, a large fraction of plants
present in 1977 are not present in 1972 and thus this would reduce our sample in a sstematic way — i.e., small plants
are more likely to tail than large plants.

• Includes 2-dig industry, region, size, type and wage dummies

greater here, it is still small. At most, less than 30 percent of the allocation into productivity and
employment growth quadrants is accounted for by observable plant characteristics.

These results provide an important caution. They tell us that the variance of employment and
productivity at the plant level are dominated by idiosyncratic effects. One interpretation of these
findings is that attempts to explain differences in productivity and employment performance should

concentrate on such plant-specific factors as management or worker skills. A striking message is

that it is possible to raise productivity and employment even within an industry that on average
is lowering productivity and employment.

It may be that there other observable characteristics that can account for the allocation of
plants into employment and productivity quadrants. However, related studies also find a dominant
role for the idiosyncratic component in accounting for plant level behavior. Davis and Haltiw anger

(1992) find that only 39% of the allocation of employment growth into expanding and contracting
plants can be accounted for by simultaneously controlling for two-digit industry, region, size, age
of plant and ownership type. This amounts to controlling for over 14,000 different sectors and even

within such sectors there is substantial heterogeneity in the distribution of employment growth

rates.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In contrast to the conventional wisdom, plants that raised employment as well as productivity
24

contribute almost as much to overall productivity growth in the 1980s as the plants that raised
productivity at the expense of employment. Together these two groups of plants that increased

productivity account for more than the total increase in productivity growth. This is because
there is an offsetting group of plants that decreased productivity over this time. Amongst the
latter group, most of them are unsuccessful upsizers. That is, they increased employment but not

productivity.
There are striking differences in the allocation of plants into these groups by sectoral classifica-

tion. Plants in mature industries (e.g., steel) were more likely to follow the conventional wisdom.

That is, they disproportionately fell into the downsizing, increasing productivity group. Plants
in the sunbelt regions are disproportionately represented in the upsizing. productivity increasing
group. However, plants in New England are also disproportionately represented in this group. The
smallest plants are disproportionately represented in the group of plants that increased employment

and decreased productivity. Strikingly, the largest plants are disproportionately represented in the

group of plants that increased employment and productivity.
In spite of the striking differences across sectors defined in a variety of ways, most of the variance

of productivity and employment growth is accounted for by idiosyncratic factors. It is difficult to
account for the allocation of plants into productivity and employment growth quadrants on the
basis of observable characteristics. Thus, not only is the conventional wisdom that downsizing

is the source of productivity growth incorrect but identifying who did and did not downsize and
whether they were successful cannot be done with any precision on the basis of the characteristics

of the plants that are reported in the Census data.
