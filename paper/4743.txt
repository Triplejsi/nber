INFORMATION, TRADING AND
STOCK RETURNS: LESSONS FROM
DUALLY-LISTED SECURiTIES

ABSTRACT
This paper compares the intra-day patterns on the NYSE and AMEX of volatility, trading

volume and bid-ask spreads for European dually-listed stocks, Japanese dually-listed stocksalso

listed in London. and Japanese dually-listed stocks not listed in London with American stocks
of comparable avenge wading volume and volatility. It is shown that the inira-day patterns for
these stocks axe remarkably similar even though the public information flows differ markedly

across these stocks during the wading day. In the morning. Japanese stocks have the greatest
volatility and volume, followed by European stocks and American stocks. These rankings are
reversed in the afternoon. We argue that these patterns are consistent with markets reacting to

the overnight accumulation of public infonnation which is greatest for Japanese stock and
smallest for American stocks and inconsistent with the view that early morning volatility can be
attributed to monopolistic specialist behavior.

1. IntroductIon.
Considerable effort has been devoted recently to teaming about the determinants of stock
return volatility. This research has identified trading noise, public information, private information

and trading mechanisms as potentially important determinants of the volatility of stock returns.

To identify the relative importance of these determinants, contributions to the literature have
focused mostly on experiments that exploit differences in trading mechanisms, in the arrival of
public information, and in whether markets are open. For instance, French and Roll (1966) use
the suspension or trading on some Wednesdays in 1968 to compare non-trading days to trading

days with similar rates of arrival of public information. Barclay, Utzenberger and Warner (1990)

use Saturdays on the Tokyo stock exchange and U.S. returns of Japanese dually-listed stocks
to investigate the impact of trading on volatility when public Information arrival Is reduced. Stolt

and Whaley (1990) make the case that the opening mechanism of the NYSE increases stock

return volatility, whereas Amihud and Mendelson (1991) use the fact that the Tokyo stock
exchange has two trading periods to argue that higher opening volatility is mostly the result of the

incorporation of overnight Information. Foster and George (1992) use trading and non-trading
period returns of dually-listed stocks and control stocks that trade only In the U.S. to argue that
the greater volatility at the open is due to the accumulation of orders at the open. Papers in this
literature focus on trading and nontrading period returns because there are no differences among.

stocks in the arrival of public information during the trading period for the experiments they
conduct.

In this paper, we Investigate the determinants of stock return volatility in a setting where

the rate of arrival of public information differs predictably acmss stocks during the trading day.
We compare the intraday return behavior during the U.S. trading day or European, Japanese, and

I

American stocks listed on the NYSE or the AMEX.' For European stocks, the arrival of public
information drops off at the end of the morning in the U.S. as the European business day comes
to an end. In contrast, for Japanese stocks, the anival of public information is uniformly low during

the U.S. trading day because the business day in Japan does not overlap with the trading day

ii the U.S. Hence, using these three classes of stocks, we compare stocks with very different
patterns of public.inforrnation arrival. Since the rate of public information arrival changes during
the day across our sample, the sample is also well-suited to study the relation between the arrival

of public information, volatility, trading volume, and bid-ask spreads. In particular, the sample is

useful to address the issue of whether the arrival of public information leads to more trading,
either because the arrivals of public and private information are correlated or because, as in the

models of Varian (1989) and Harris and Raviv (1993). investors trade on public information
because it changes their priors differentially.

If public information is an important determinant of volatility, one would expect European
stocks to experience a drop in volatility relative to American stocks when the European business

day ends. We rind that indeed more of the daily volatility of European stocks accrues during the
morning than for American stocks with similar daily volume and volatility, but the difference is not

statistically significant. The rate of accrual of volatility does not significantly differ between
American stocks and European stocks in any of the four 65-minute trading periods from 10:35
to 14:55; further, the cumulative difference in the rate of accrual of volatility between European
stocks and the American matching stocks never exceeds 2% of daily volatility. When we turn to

'In an interesting recent paper, Kleldon and Werner (1993) examine the intraday patterns of
cross-listed U.K stocks from the open in London to their close in the U.S. to understand better
the implications of 24-hour trading of stocks. In their paper, they do not provide the comparisons
across classes of stocks with different arrival rates of public information which are the focus of
this paper. In this paper, we treat European stocks as a group and Japanese stocks as a group.
Consequently, we do not investigate separately London-listed stocks. The results we report for
the European sample are not inconsistent with those of Kleidon and Werner (1993), though.

2

Japanese stocks, these stocks also display higher volatility in the morning despite the fact that
there is no reason to suspect that they would have more public information in the morning than

their matching American stocks. After the first hour of trading, 40% of the daily volatility of
Japanese stocks has accnied in contrast to 29% of the daily volatility of European stocks.
American matching stocks, however. accrue significantly more volatility than Japanese stocks in
every trading period from 10:35 to 14:55.
Our results raise two puzzles: (1) why do foreign stocks behave so much like comparable

American stocks during the trading day and (2) why is the high volatility in the early morning
trading in New York pervasive across stocks? Since the European and some Japanese stocks

trade in Europe. there are observed foreign prices for most of the foreign stocks in our sample
when New York opens and there is also a competing market for these stocks. The explanations

for the higher volatility In the morning, such as price discovery or the role of the specialist imply
that the abnormal early moming volatility should be smaller for foreign stocks, which we do not

observe. Explanations which rely on private information trading also seem to be inappropriate
here since one would expect private information to be more important in New York for domestic
stocks.

We argue that trading on accumulated overnight public information helps explain the
puzzle that volatility and volume are high on foreign stocks early in the moming. If overnight
public information Is incorporated In pilces at the opening, one would expect less volatility and

less volume on Japanese stocks than on their matching stocks early in the morning since the
arrival rate of public information for these stocks is low relative to American stocks. In contrast,
if there Is uncertainty as to how American Investors will react to the accumulated ovemight public

information, the opposite is possible If the accumulated public Information for Japanese stocks
is more important than the accumulated public information accrued on American stocks and the

3

public information accruing on these stocks early in the morning. Ta understand this, suppose that

stock trading Is segmented in the sense that investors trade a stock in their home country if they
can.' This means that American investors trade foreign stocks In New York if they are listed there.

When New York opens, American investors therefore adjust their portfolios based on how the

information that accrued ovemight affects their priors. Since markets have been open in the

foreign countries after the previous close of New York trading, substantially more public
information has accrued about foreign stocks than about domestic stocks. Hence, one would
expect both more volatility and more trading for foreign stocks in the morning in reaction to the

overnight accumulation of public information. Since public information about American firms
accrues at a higher rate during the day, one would expect more volatility and trading for these

stocks later in the day. However, if American news is Informative about foreign stocks, the
differences in volatility and volume patterns between foreign and domestic stocks during the rest

of the day are likely to be smaller than one would expect if American news conveys no
information about foreign stocks, which helps explain why intraday day patterns are similar for
domestic and foreign stocks.

The paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, we present our data and returns evidence.

In section 3, we show the volatility patterns. In sections 4 and 5, we discuss respectively the
evidence on volume and bid-ask spreads. We condude in section 6.

SectIon 2. Data and evidence on returns.
The dataset we use is constructed as follows. Using the 1986 and 1987 ISSM tapes, we

2 Kleidon and Werner (1993) provide evidence that the London and New York markets are
segmented, in the sense that they have separate, distinct intra-day patterns such that the New
York intra-day pattern is not the continuation of the London intra-day pattern. Their concept of
segmentation does not imply segmented trading, but segmented trading implies distinct intra-day
patterns.

select all listings under the names ADR, New York Shares and Common Stocks from countries

in the European time zone and from Japan. To be kept in the dataset, firms must have at least

6 trades a day on average, have 100 trading days in the year, and the lowest price in the year
must be more than $3. For each foreign firm, we select three matching domestic stocks which
have similar trading activity in terms of the average daily number of trades, have similar standard

deviations of hourly returns, and trade on the same exchange as the dual listed share? We drop

all observations from October 14, 1987 to October 30, 1987. The Appendix lists our sample of
foreign stocks and the matching stocks. We have 14 European stocks in 1986 and 21 in 1987.
Them are 5 Japanese stocks in the sample for 1986 and for 1987; of the Japanese stocks, 2 are
listed in London in 1986 and in 1987.
To Investigate intraday patterns, we treat the opening trade separately from the rest of the

day that is divided In six equally spaced intervals of 65 minutes from 9:30 a.m. to 4.00 p.m. For
the opening return, we use the return from the previous overnight dose to the first trade or to the

mid-point of the first bid-ask quote, whichever is first observed. The return for each interval is
computed from the mid-point of the last bid-ask quote before the end of the previous interval to
the mid-point of the last bid-ask quote of the Interval. If the bid-ask quote does not change during

the interval, the return for the interval is set equal to zero. If the absolute value of the return is
greater than 50% during the interval, it is Ignored.
For the variance estimates, we first compute the average return, r for each interval i and

each firm j by taking the average of the returns r across T days. where T is the number of days
for which the returns are available. We then compute a squared return adjusted for the average

return, (r - r/, which we call V. We average V across firms of the same class in the sample

We also compared intra-day patterns by matching ADRs with domestic stocks of similar
volume only. Our condusions are generally the same in that case.

to obtain VN for that class of firms. In this study, we use six different firm classes: European firms,

Japanese firms, Japanese firms also listed In London, Japanese firms not listed in London,
matching firms of European firms, and matching firms of Japanese firms.
To test for differences In intraday patterns between two classes of firms, we pair them in
the following system of equations:

V11 - bb0 +

V-(1 -1b)bQ+eQ

v -(1 -

i01...5

(1)

+ b1D)b +

where i = 0 corresponds to the open, and the variables and coefficients with an asterisk are for
the second firm class. In this setting, the parameter bD is the total intraday variance excluding the

5, measure the opening and intraday variance

opening variance. The b coefficients, fori = 0,1

as a fraction of the total intraday variance, and the b coefficients measure the variance
differences between the first and the second firm class. This approach is inspired by the work of

Foster and Viswanathan (1993). They estimate intraday patterns separately for each firm and
then derive implications from the distribution of these patterns across firms. The small number

of dually-listed firms prevents us from focusing on the distribution of intraday patterns across
firms. Instead, we estimate the intraday patterns for each class of firms directly.

In estimating equations (1), we use Hansen's (1982) Generalized Method of Moments
(GMM) procedure. We impose the following orthogonality conditions:

6

To estimate b, the vector of 14 unknown b coefficients, we minimize the quadratic form g'Wg,
where W, a symmetric weighting matrix, is a consistent estimator of the inverse of the asymptotic

covariance matrix or T"2g(6), where 6 is the estimate of b, after adjusting for serial correlation
as suggested by Newey and West (1987). Note that in (2). each equation descilbes the variance

in an intraday period. Consequently, if there Is autocorrelation in the residuals, it arises from the
daily autocorrelation of the volatility for that lntraday period. The correlation in volatility between
intraday periods, or cross-correlation, is captured as cross-sectional covariance In the weighting

matrix W. Though the system is just identified and our 0MM estimates coincide with those of
ordinary least squares, our standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation and
cross-correlation between Intra-day periods.

With 6 as the vector of estimates of b, and 8T as the consistent estimator of

8g4)
we have

- b) - N(o,IST'wsTr').
We test for the significance of the estimates using this covariance matrix.
Volume for an intraday interval refers to the normalized number of shares traded during
that interval. We first calculate the number of shares traded over each interval. We then compute

the firm average as the average across all intervals and all days. To obtain the normalized
7

volume during an interval, we divide the number of shares traded over that interval by the firm
average, and take the average across firms. To test for significance, we estimate equations (1)
using the volume instead of the squared returns.

The bid-ask spread is measured as a percent of the bid-ask mid-point. It is observed at

the market open and at the end of eath trading interval. We then estimate equations (I) using
the bid-ask spreads, but the estimated coefficients are scaled so that they can be interpreted as

the bid-ask spread in an Interval as a fraction of the bid-ask spread during the third trading
literval (11:40-12:45).

Although our focus is not the intraday returns, we present evidence on these returns in
table 1 and figure 1 for the sake of completeness. Intra-day retums follow a U-shaped pattern for

all stocks similar to the one documented previously by Harris (1966). This reinforces one of the

two puzzles we document, namely the similarity in intra-day patterns between domestic and
foreign stocks trading in New York: all stock groups have a significant last interval return. The
overnight return is positive for all stock groups, but significant for foreign stocks only. The other
E'ttra-day retums are insignificant except for the return for European stocks in the first interval.

Looking at the difference in returns between firm types, we find that European stocks have
significantly lower returns in the first trading interval and significantly higher returns overnight and
Ei the fifth trading interval. Japanese stocks have a significantly higher return than their matthing

stocks ovemight and in the last interval and do not have asignificantly different return from their
matching stocks in any other interval. The Japanese stocks listed in London have a significantly
higher return in the third trading period than those which are not and have insignificantly different
returns in all the other periods.

Section 3. Intra-day volatility patterns.
Intra-day volatility patterns have been studied (or U.S. stocks with the database we use.
First, Wood, Mcinish and Ord (1985) using minute by minute transactions data show a U-shaped

pattern for intra-day volatility. Harris (1986) also documents a strong U-shaped pattern for intraday volatility using 15-minutes returns. Finally. Foster and Viswanathan (1993) present results that

are comparable to our study. They investigate the Intra-day volatility for three groups of stocks.
They divide the sample of NYSE stocks on the ISSM database that meet some selection criteria

into deciles of trading activity and select 20 stocks in the first, fifth and tenth deciles of trading
ac*ity. They show that, for all their deciles, there is significant intraday variation in volatility, with

volatility being the highest during the first half-hour of trading. To make the first half-hour
comparable to the other periods, they double its return. They compare all trading intervals to the

first half-hour and find that all intervals have a significantly lower variance than the first Interval.

For the first and tenth deciles, the coefficient estimates of regressions similar to (1) show a
distinct U-shaped pattern, but no suth pattem is present for the fifth decile.
Table 2 presents our coefficient estimates of equations (1). Since the fractions of intraday

intervals sum to one, the coefficient for the last trading interval is just one minus the sum of the

5 previous intraday intervals and no individual t-test is possible for that interval. The results for
European stocks are given in panel A. The estimates give the normalized variance for an interval,

defined as a fraction of the total Intraday variance ignoring the close-to-open variance. It Is
immediately apparent that the variance fractions follow a U-shaped pattern during the day and

this is confirmed In figure 2A. The dose-to-open variance has the highest traction and the
fractions decline thereafter until the Interval from 12:45 to 13:50. After this period, the fractions
increase again. The same pattern holds for the domestic comparison stocks.

Table 2 makes it possible to compare per period the volatility patterns of the European

9

i overnight normalized variances is of the same magnitude as the differences in overnight
normalized variances for European stocks and their matching American stocks, which is
significant. Hence, one can interpret this evidence as indicating that investors are more willing to

trade at the open when a competing exchange is open. Two possible reasons forthis are: (a)
opening prices are less noisy or (b) trading is cheaper because or competition. Given that the rate

of volatility accn.ial for Japanese stocks not fisted in London is not higher following the open. it
is hard to argue that the data is supportive of (a). To investigate (b), we have to look at bid-ask
spreads which we do next.

Section 5. BId-ask spread Intra-day patterns.
We now tum to a comparison of the bid-ask intra-day patterns. Existing evidence for

American stocks from Mclnish and Wood (1992), Hasbrouck (1991a,b) and Foster and
Viswanathan (1993) indicates that there is a U-shaped pattern in bid-ask spreads. Foster and
Viswanathan show that there are significant differences in adverse selection costs during the day,
but that these differences are hard to reconcile with models of concentrated trading which suggest

that the bid-ask spread should be tower when trading is highest. Their evidence is stronger for
the most actively traded firms, however.
In table 7, we provide our evidence on intra-day patterns in bid-ask spreads. In panel A,
we report the results for European stocks. The midday spread is lower for European stocks than

it is for their matching American stocks. However, at the open, the normalized spread for
European stocks, i.e., the spread divided by its midday value, is significantly higher than for
American stocks: 17.2% versus 11.7%. Hence, the existence of a competing market for the
European stocks does not imply a smatler spike in spread in the morning, which makes it hard
18

intraday volatility during the first trading Interval even though, In contrast to the European and

American stocks, their home business and trading days are over. As a result of this greater

accrual of volatility In the first trading interval, Japanese stocks have significantly higher
normalized volatility than their comparison group during that interval. In contrast, the comparison
group has significantly higher normalized volatility over each of the subsequent four intervals and
identical normalized volatility during the last interval. Hence, there is more evidence of differences

in volatility patterns between Japanese and U.S. stocks than between European and U.S. stocks,

in the sense of more intervals with significant differences. This is evidenced by the fact that the
ratio of moming to afternoon normalized volatility of Japanese stocks is significantly higher than
the ratio of morning to afternoon normalized volatility of matching stocks. Finally, for the Japanese

stocks, the differences In normalized volatility are more economically significant: the fraction of

intraday volatility that accrues to Japanese stocks In the first period of trading is almost 50%
higher than the fraction that accrues to the comparison group of American stocks.

Table 3 provides a measure of how volatility accrues during the day which confirms the
results of table 2. The volatility accrual rate for European stocks is faster than for their matching

American stocks throughout the day until the last trading period, so that before the start of that

period significantly more volatility has accrued for European stocks than for their matching
American stocks. The volatility accrual rate for Japanese stocks is faster also, but it is also faster
relative to European stocks. In contrast to European stocks, Japanese stocks accrue significantly

more volatility than their matching American stocks early in the morning. At the end of the first
three trading periods, the Japanese stocks have accrued significantly more volatility than their
matching stocks. However, the difference in volatility accrual falls steadily during the day so that
by the end of the fourth trading period the fraction of daily volatility accrued for Japanese stocks
is indistinguishable from the fraction of daily volatility accrued for American stocks.

11

There are several possible explanations for the evidence we uncover in tables 2 and 3.

First, following Amihud and Mendelson (1991), one could argue that opening prices are noisy
estimates of public information, so that the first hour Of trading incorporates public information into

prices that was already available at the opening. Since the Japanese business day doses after
the end of the Japanese trading day, Japanese public information accrues after the dose of the

trading day in Japan. For stocks not listed in Europe, this information can only be incorporated
into prices when the NYSE opens. In contrast, for stocks listed in Europe, there is trading when

the NYSE opens, so stock prices provide more predse estimates of the existing public
information. The price discovery hypothesis suggests that morning volatility accrual should be
less for the stocks listed In London. Panel C in table 2 explores this hypothesis by dividing the
Japanese stocks into stocks listed in London and stocks not listed in London. In the first trading

period, there is no difference between the two groups, whereas in the second period, Londonlisted stocks have higher normalized volatility than non-London listed stocks. This evidence does
not support the price discovery hypothesis. The second trading period corresponds to the London

dose; hence, the Japanese stocks listed in London have an increase in volatility around the
London dose, so that their intra-day volatility in the U.S. inherits both the U-shaped pattern of
London stocks and the U-shaped pattern of U.S. stocks. In contrast, but similarly to Kieidon and

Werner (1993), the European stocks do not exhibit an increase in volatility at the dose of the
European markets.

Since the New York specialist does not have a monopoly position at the opening for
European stocks and for Japanese stocks listed in London, the higher first period normalized
volatility can be attributed to specialist behavior only if one believes that American investors would

not switth to the foreign market to avoid specialist rent-seeking. Whereas such a view is plausible

given the higher transaction costs abroad, one would still expect to observe greater volatility for

12

domestic stocks for the simple reason that there are fewer alternatives for investors wishing to
trade domestic stocks than for investors wishing to trade foreign stocks. Hence, it is hard to view

our evidence as supportive of the argument advanced by Stoll and Whaley (1990).

It could well be that the massive overnight arrival of public Information for foreign stocks

is accompanied by an equally massive anival of short-lived private information. If this were the
case, one would expect investors to trade on this private information early in the day. With this
view, though, one would expect the volatility Increase to be smaller for Japanese stocks traded

in London than for Japanese stocks not traded in London simply because some of the private
infôtination will be traded upon In London. As explained above, this is not the case.
The final explanation we consider is inspired by the trading models of Varian (1989) and

Harris and Raviv (1993). In these models, investors trade on public information because new

information leads them to change their pilots. Hence, American investors in Japanese or
European stocks trade on the overnight public information as the New York market opens if there

is segmented trading. Since we don't assume that these investors have valuable private
information which would be lost If they did not trade before New York opens, one would not
expect them to use the London market. Since London trading does not reflect how American
investors react to overnight public Information, the lack of a volatility difference in the first period

of trading between Japanese stocks listed in London and those that are not can be understood
with our explanation. If our explanation is correct, though, one would expect more trading early
in the moming for foreign stocks. We tum to a comparison of intra-day patterns in volume next.
All the above analysis Is done by computing retums using the mid-point between the bid
and ask quotes. We interpret this mid-point as the efficient market price, so that changes in that
mid-point correspond to the Incorporation of new information into prices. It could be, though, that

the mid-point moves around because of microstructural considerations. such as inventory

13

concerns. This raises the question or whether these concerns could make our inferences from
the data Invalid. One approach would be to follow the time-series analysisof Hasbrouck (1 991a,b)

and allow explicitly for a transitory component in the mid-point of the bid-ask quote. Instead, we
show that our results about the similarity of the volatility patterns do not seemto depend on the

use of the mid-point of the bid-ask quote. Panel A of table 4 shows results obtained using
transaction prices. The intraday variance of transaction prices is higher because of bid-ask
bounce. However, there seems to be no systematic mlcitstructural effect which explains our
results. The intraday patterns using transaction prices are mostly the same. In terms of the

comparison between foreign and American stocks, the most pronounced effect of using
transaction returns is for the first trading period for European stocks where the volatility difference

is now significant and for the second trading period for Japanese stocks where it is no longer
significant. As a result of these changes, the European stocks accnie significantly more volatility

in the morning than matching American stocks. The differences between transaction return
volatilities and bid-ask midpoint vplatilities are illustrated in panel B of table 4 and figure 3. There

is a significant difference for the overnight period, but no significant differences for the intraday
periods for the dually-listed stocks, except for the fourth trading period for the Japanese stocks
isted on the LSE. Considering transaction returns has the effect of strengthening somewhat the
result that European stocks have higher volatility than matching American stocks in the morning.

Section 4. Intra-day patterns In volume.
Jam and Joh (1988) report the hourly trading volume of the NYSE and demonstrate a U-

shaped pattern in trading volume during the day. Foster and Viswanathan (1993) examine the
intra-day volume pattern for top, bottom and middle deciles sorted by trading activity. They find
litra-day differences in volume for all categories, but the differences are most pronounced for the

14

most actively traded stocks. For all categories, though, the intra-day pattern has a U-shape with

volume highest in the first half hour, falling until the fourth hour and then increasing again. The

highest volume coincides with the highest variance, wtiich Is supportive of the model of
concentrated trading of Adrnati and Pfleiderer (1988). Foster and Viswanathan (1993) investigate

formally the relation between the regression coefficients of the volume regressions and of the
volatility regressions. For deciles one and ten they find a significant positive relationbetween the
coefficients of the two regressions.

In table 5 and figure 4, we present our results for the intra-day variation in volume. In
panel A, we show the results for the European stocks. It is immediately dear that these stocks

exhibit a U-shaped intra-day pattern and this is shown in figure 4A. One way to evaluate this
pattern is by comparing a periods fraction of daily volume with the fraction of dailyvolume of the
period from 11:40 to 12:45. When we perform this comparison, we find significant differences for

all periods. European stocks have significantly more of their daily volume in the morning,
American stocks have significantly more in the afternoon, except in the last period. Relative to
the period from 11:40 to 12:45, European stocks have significantly sharper peaks than matching

American stocks. For instance, the first interval volume is 1.644 times the volume of the mid-day

period for European stocks and 1.215 for matching stocks. The difference has a t-statistic of
8.116. For the last period, the ratios are respectively 1.297 and 1.379, with a t-statistic for the
difference of 1.642. To Investigate further the concentration of trading, we compute Herfindahl
indices as the sum of the squared volume accrual rates. This ratio would take a value of one if
all trading is concentrated in one period and a value of 1F6 If trading takes place equally in each

period. The Herfindahl index is 0.180 for Eutopean stocks and 0.172 for American matching
stocks. Hence, both European and American stocks seem to have equally concentrated trading

when measured this way. We saw in table 2 that the normalized variance of European stocks

15

exceeds the normalized variance of American comparison stocks by 1.9% of total intraday
variance during the first trading interval; In contrast, the difference in volume is 4.6%. Whereas

European stocks have significantly higher volume in the morning, they have significantly lower
volume In the afternoon except during the last trading period where there is no difference between

European and American stocks.

One might be tempted to attribute the differences in significance between tables 2 and 5
to differences in the power of the tests. It is true that differences between European and American

firms of similar magnitudes are significant for normalized volume but not for normalized volatility.

A closer look at the cumulative accnial of volume shows, however, that the volume and volatility
pattems are quite different. The estimate of the cumulative difference in normalized volatility from

10:35 to 14:55 Is zero whereas the estimate of the cumulative difference in normalized volume

is 4.0% over that period. For the last trading period, table 2 documents a significant difference
in normalized volatility, whereas it documents no significant differences in normalized volatility in
the four previous periods. In contrast, the normalized volume difference is not significant (or the
last period and is significantly different for all the other periods.

Panel B of table 5 provides results for the Japanese stocks. For these stocks, we again
observe a U-shaped pattem which is also apparent in figure 4B. This pattern is more pronounced

than for American stocks: a higher fraction of Japanese stock trading accrues in the first and last
trading intervals than for American stocks. For both the Japanese and matching American stocks.

the fraction of daily volume which accrues during the last interval is roughly comparable to the
fraction of daily volume which accrues during the first interval. The higher end-of-day volume of
the Japanese stocks is not accompanied by higher volatility. Except for the last interval, though.

Japanese stocks have greater volatility when they have greater volume. In contrast to the
comparison between European stocks and American stocks, the differences in volume are smaller

16

than the differences in volatility: the fraction of volume that accrues to Japanese stocks in excess

of the fraction of volume that accrues to American stocks during the first interval is only 3.7% ol

the daily total in contrast to 9.9% for the variance. The small differences explain why the
Herfindahl ratio for trade concentration of Japanese stocks, 0.186, is so close to the one (or
matchiAg American stocks, 0.174. As for the comparison with European stocks, the Japanese

stocks have lower normalized volume each period from 10:35 to 14:55 and higher normalized
volume in the first and last interval.

Table 6 provides results on cumulative intraday volume. It shows that the normalized
volume of American stocks catches up with the normalized volume of Japanese stocks more
quickly during the day than it catches up with the normalized volume of European stocks. By
13:50, as much of the daily volume has accrued for American comparison stocks as for Japanese

stocks; for European stocks, this occurs by 14:55. This evidence is consistent with the view that
investors receive more information to trade upon late in the morning for European stocks than for

Japanese stocks.
The private information story would suggest more accumulation of volume early in the day

for Japanese stocks which do not trade on the London Stock Exchange. Panel C of tables 5 and

6 compares Japanese stocks listed in London with those that are not. There is some evidence
that (1) stocks listed in London trade more at the open and (2) volume accumulates faster after

the opening for stocks not listed in London. Interestingly, the greater normalized volume at the
open for London-listed stocks is approximately offset by the lesser normalized volume of these

stocks during the first two trading intervals. Hence, availability of the London market does lead
to a shift in trading towards the open. This shift is not accompanied by a similar significant shift

in variances: in table 2, the overnight normalized variance for stocks traded in London is
insignificantly higher and the first interval variance is insignificantly lower. Further, the difference

17

i overnight normalized variances is of the same magnitude as the differences in overnight
normalized variances for European stocks and their matching American stocks, which is
significant. Hence, one can interpret this evidence as indicating that investors are more willing to

trade at the open when a competing exchange is open. Two possible reasons forthis are: (a)
opening prices are less noisy or (b) trading is cheaper because or competition. Given that the rate

of volatility accn.ial for Japanese stocks not fisted in London is not higher following the open. it
is hard to argue that the data is supportive of (a). To investigate (b), we have to look at bid-ask
spreads which we do next.

Section 5. BId-ask spread Intra-day patterns.
We now tum to a comparison of the bid-ask intra-day patterns. Existing evidence for

American stocks from Mclnish and Wood (1992), Hasbrouck (1991a,b) and Foster and
Viswanathan (1993) indicates that there is a U-shaped pattern in bid-ask spreads. Foster and
Viswanathan show that there are significant differences in adverse selection costs during the day,
but that these differences are hard to reconcile with models of concentrated trading which suggest

that the bid-ask spread should be tower when trading is highest. Their evidence is stronger for
the most actively traded firms, however.
In table 7, we provide our evidence on intra-day patterns in bid-ask spreads. In panel A,
we report the results for European stocks. The midday spread is lower for European stocks than

it is for their matching American stocks. However, at the open, the normalized spread for
European stocks, i.e., the spread divided by its midday value, is significantly higher than for
American stocks: 17.2% versus 11.7%. Hence, the existence of a competing market for the
European stocks does not imply a smatler spike in spread in the morning, which makes it hard
18

to explain this spike by the monopolist behavior of NYSE specialists. Thenormalized spread for

European stocks falls continuously throughout the day, except for being higher in the interval
from 13:50 to 14:55 than In the surrounding intervals. All afternoon spreads are lower than at mid-

day for European stocks and two are significantly lower. The last trading period spread is the
lowest of the day and is significantly lower than the spread of the American matching stocks. As

shown on figure 5, European stocks do not exhibit a U-shaped pattern of bid-ask spreads even

though their volume and volatility do. The normalized bid-ask spread of European stocks is
significantly higher than that of the matching stocks at the beginning of the day and significantly
lower at the end of the day. Nevertheless, the matching stocks do not exhibit much of a (i-shaped

pattern either the bid-ask spread of matching stocks at the end of the day is not significantly
higher than the bid-ask spread at midday.

Panel B of table 7 and figure 5 provIde evidence for Japanese stocks. Again, for these
stocks the bid-ask spread at midday is lower than for the matching American stocks. The results

early in the morning are similar to those shown in panel A, with a higher normalized spread for
the Japanese stocks than for their matching American stocks. Contraiy to the European stocks,

though, the bid-ask spread for Japanese stocks at the end of the day is not significantly lower
than at midday. There is no evidence that competition by foreign markets eliminates the higher

bid-ask spread in the morning. The absence of a higher bid-ask spread at the end of the day
cannot be attributed to competition since foreIgn markets are dosed at that time. Further, in our

sample, the behavior of the Japanese stocks at the end of the day is not different from their
matching stocks.

It is difficult to believe that the greater normalized spread of foreign stocks early in the
morning reflects greater adverse selection resulting from a higher probability that the specialist
would end up trading with investors who have private information. This Is because, presumably,

19

private information trading is more kely to take place on the deeper home market of a security

and during the foreign business day. It may well be, though, that In the morning, as American
livestors react to overnight public information, there is a substantial risk for the specialist of large

changes in his Inventory resulting from changes in the American investors' demand for foreign
securities. The specialist would protect himself from such changes by posting a greater bid-ask
spread.

Section 6. ConcludIng remarks.
In this paper, we investigate the intraday volatility, volume, and bid-ask spread patterns
for stocks that differ markedly in the arrival rate of public information during the trading day. We

lInd that, in spite of the differences in the anival rate of public information, all groups of stocks
have U-shaped patterns of volume and volatility. The U-shaped patterns in volatility cannot be
explained by the conternporaneous arrival of public information for the different stocks. Models
with trading on private information do not seem to be consistent with our results. This is because,

for Japanese stocks, one would expect volatility to be less for the stocks listed in London than
for the other stocks if private information is a major determinant of volatility because investors with

private information presumably take advantage of the opportunity to trade in London. We find no
support for this.

A plausible story for our results is that investors in the U.S. trade on the basis of the
accumulated stock of public information since the last dosing of the U.S. markets. This stock of

liformation is the largest for Japanese stocks since a whole business day takes place between
the dose and open of U.S. markets, the second largest for European stocks since more than half

a business day takes place between the dose and open of U.S. markets, and smallest for
American stocks. With this view, investors trade on public information because it changes their

20

priors. The process of demand revelation causes pices toexhibit greater volatility. Consequently,

the opening price is not a noisy estimate of the fundamentals known at the open; rather, the
demand by American investors Is revealed only over time as they react to the accumulated public
information. The volatility of matching American stocks is lower in the moming because not much

has happened to change Investors' priors. Bid-ask spreads are larger in the morning for foreign
stocks because there is more uncertainty about demand. The foreign Mocks also have a trading

concentration at the end of the day, but it is more likely due to random forces than to investors
reacting to public information, since little public information has accrued on these stocks during
the day. Hence, this concentration of trading does not lead to higher bid-ask spreads. VVhereas

one can understand the greater concentration of trading of foreign stocks early in the day, the
concentration of trading towards the end of the day is a puzzle left for future research.

The great similarity of the intra-day patterns across Europen, Japanese and American
stocks suggests that, once one compares stocks with similar volume and volatility, differences in

the rate of arrival of public information during the day, as opposed to ovemight, are not as
important as expected. This result can be interpreted as evidence that news during the U.S.

business day are sufficienily important for foreign stocks that they lead to intra-day patterns
similar to those of U.S. stocks of similar volume and volatility.
