Indeed, despite its seeming simplicity, family income is a relatively complex

economic variable that depends only in part upon individual wages. Family
income can include the earnings of more than one family member, and can also
include income that is not earned, for example, transfer payments and asset

income. In addition, individuals' total earnings are determined not just by
their earnings per hour, but also by the number of hours they work. Thus, in

proceeding from the study of individual wage inequality — which has a strong
theoretical and empirical foundation in labor economics —

to

the study of

family income inequality, one is necessarily led to consider theories of

family formation and family labor supply. Although we have not attempted to
develop and estimate a structural model of total family income that is
compatible with all these bodies of economic theory, they will guide and
enrich the structure of several of the empirical analyses we report below.
The first objective of this paper is to deepen our understanding of the
increase in family income inequality that occurred in the United States during

the l980s. We do this by exploring the structure of family income inequality,
with an emphasis on identifying how that structure nay have changed during the
1.980s. In particular, we analyze family income on a source-by-source basis,
focusing on the variability and relative magnitude of different income

sources, and the correlations between the magnitudes of those sources. Our
attention is restricted to families headed by married couples with a
prime-aged husband, a population that the research literature has accorded
much less attention than it has female-headed families with children or

families headed by elderly individuals. Our analysis permits us to consider
whether the increase in income inequality among married couples that occurred
in the l9SOs in the United States reflects, among other things, changes in the
distribution of outcomes in the labor market, changes in the labor supply

2

behavior of husbands and wives, or an increase in the similarity of husbands'
and wives' labor market outcomes.
One of the key empirical results that emerges from our analysis is that
increased income inequality in the United States in the l980s is associated
with a sizable increase in the correlation between husbands' and wives'

earnings. We take this finding as the jumping-off point for a further
analysis in which we seek to identify the roots of this change. For this
analysis we focus on the correlation of the natural logarithm of earnings

across spouses. Given that this correlation can increase because of an
increase in the correlation of husbands' and wives characteristics that
determine wages earned and hours worked, or because of changes in the
regression weights associated with those characteristics, we also fit and
analyze some simple wage and hours equations for husbands and wives.
The final objective of this paper is to measure income inequality among

married couples in several other industrial countries at different points in
the 1980s and to explore the nature and stability of the economic structure

generating inequality in those countries. By means of this analysis, we hope
to determine whether increased income inequality among married couples is

primarily a United States phenomenon. We also hope to make and interpret
cross-country comparisons of changes that have occurred in the structure

of

family income inequality.

We also performed detailed analyses of the married-couple income

distributions for Canada and Australia. We were able to obtain appropriate
microdata for both these countries that would allow us to study how the
structural components of income inequality changed in these countries in the

early 1980s. We also present results for four European countries — France
the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom —

3

using

data from the

Luxembourg Income Study (LIS). Unfortunately, the lack of information on
labor supply in these data keeps us from performing the same type of analysis

of earnings inequality as we are able to perform for Australia, Canada, and
the United States.

Although we offer limited evidence on the extent to which the Australia,
Canada1 and the United States are representative of a broader set of
industrial countries with respect to the substantive matters under study, we
do think these countries provide the basis for some interesting comparisons.

For example, all three countries experienced net employment shifts during the

1980s from goods production to service industries. In addition, male labor
force participation declined slightly in all three countries, while female

labor force participation increased. Marriage and fertility rates also
declined in all these countries during the l980s. However, the national
unemployment rate decreased in the United States, but increased in the other
two

countries.

Also, union density was considerably lower and declined at a

much faster pace in the United States than in Canada and Australia throughout

the 1980s. Finally, changes in real government expenditures on welfare and
social security varied widely among the countries on a per capita basis.
Thus, there seems to be enough (but not too much) diversity among the
three countries to suggest that cross-national comparisons might shed some
light on the importance of different economic circumstances and institutions

in the determination of income inequality. Unfortunately, the data sets we
analyze are generally not sufficiently comparable to justify making

cross-national inequality comparisons at a point in time. However, we do feel
comfortable comparing countries in terms of changes in inequality, because the
data sets for each country are comparable over time.

I. The Income Source Composition of Family Income Inequality
Several recent studies of income dispersion in the United States have

focused on the distribution of income across families. This literature
generally

defines the family to be a unit that consists of two or more persons

related by blood or marriage who live together. Some studies also include

unrelated individuals —

individuals

living alone or with other individuals to

whom they are not related — as separate family units (see, for example,
Blackburn and Bloom 1981; Karoly 1993). In this paper we analyze only
families headed by married couples. Hence, our results pertain to only a
segment of either definition of the total population of families. This
restriction facilitates our decomposition of income inequality into
contributions from various sources of income, which helps us in investigating
the influence of the growth in two-earner couples on overall income

inequality. The pattern of change in inequality over the period we are
considering is reasonably similar for all families and for married-couple
families in the three countries we examine.1
Table I presents three measures of total income inequality among married
couple families in the United States and Canada in 1979 and 1987, and in

Australia in 1981/82 and 1985/86. The samples used for this and later tables

Australia show increases in dispersion in the early 1980s using all the three

measures. For Canada, the mean logarithmic deviation falls slightly, Theil's
entropy measure increases slightly (but less than this index

increased in the

United States), and the squared coefficient of variation increases modestly,

but less than the increase observed in the United States.3
Table I contains two estimates of the squared coefficient of variation

for Australia. The first estimate (and the }D and ENT) was calculated using
a measure of total family income that does not include interest and dividend

income. We excluded this income source because the process by which it was
collected changed dramatically from 1981/82 to 1985/86. Using a decomposition
property of the squared coefficient of variation (discussed below), we also
calculated an inequality measure that included interest and dividend income

(reported in parentheses in the table). In this calculation, we used the
parameters characterizing the distribution of interest and dividend income in
1985/86 for both 1981/82 and 1985/86, thereby allowing the relative importance
of this source to change as it did in the national income accounts of

Australia4. The increase in inequality measured this way is similar to the

for the United States and Canadian surveys, meaningful inequality comparisons
between these two countries at a point in time may be possible. The data used
for these calculations are discussed later in this section, with further
details reported in appendix A.
3The fact that the mean logarithmic deviation did not increase in Canada, but
the entropy and squared coefficient of variation did, reflects the property
that the mean logarithmic deviation is relatively more sensitive to changes at
the lower end of the distribution (and the lowest quintile in Canada
experienced an increase in its total share of income over this period), while
the squared coefficient of variation is more sensitive to changes at the upper
end (where changes were occurring so as to increase inequality in Canada).
4The major effect of the change in collection procedures was to increase (from
0.04 to 0.07) the percentage of family income that was due to interest and
dividend income, and perhaps to increase the measured inequality of interest
and dividend income, in the national income accounts, the share of income
from interest and dividends increased only slightly during this period. As

increase observed when excluding interest and dividend income. In the
analysis of the squared coefficient of variation that follows, we will
continue to use this procedure for the Australian data.
Given that family income is composed of income from several different
sources, a natural question is whether the increases in family income
inequality reported in table 1 can be linked to increases in the inequality of
one or more income sources or to some other underlying change in the

distribution of family income. In particular, we wish to explore whether
observed increases in earnings inequality among husbands (and possibly wives)
can account for all the increases in family income inequality in table 1, or

whether some oher factor might also be partly responsible for the increases.
Following earlier analyses of the distribution of family income (Gronau
1982; Lehrer and Nerlove 1984; Schirm 1988; smith 1979), we focus on the

squared coefficient of variation as our measure of dispersion. Dividing a
family's income into J different sources, the squared coefficient of variation
-

which is simply the ratio of the variance of income to the square of its

arithmetic mean - can be written as:

of income, equation (1) still holds as long as the CVs are calculated using
the zeros.5
Equation (1) provides few general predictions about how overall income
inequality (CV2) can be expected to change given changes in the shares, the

C1s or the correlation coefficients (see Schirm 1988). The only
prediction that does not depend on values of the other parameters is the

following: if the correlation coefficient between two

provided that all correlation coefficients involving the jth source of income

are positive (this condition is sufficient, but not necessary). The effects

of changes in the shares of the income sources are generally unclear. For
example, if the share of the jth income source increases and the share of the
lcth source falls by the same amount, then the direction of the change in C'?

will depend on the relative sizes of CV and CV, as well as of all other
shares, coefficients of variation, and correlation coefficients.

While predicting how changes in the income source coefficients of
variation or shares will affect overall inequality is difficult, a direct
estimate of the effect on GV2 of changes in the components of the
decomposition in equation (I) for actual or assumed values of the other

components is possible. For example, suppose we wish to estimate how changes
in the dispersion of husbands' earnings from 1979 to 1987 affected income

5Other decompositions of c'? are also possible, for example, CV2 can be
expressed as an exact function of the means, variances, and covariances of the
J income sources. However, the & decomposition we use has the attractive
property that each of the components of the decomposition are invariant to the
scale in which income is measured (as is CV' itself), while the alternative
decomposition does not possess this property.

CV2 would

have been if the inequality of husbands' earnings changed from its observed
1979 level to its observed 1987 level, but all other parameters in the
decomposition equation remained at their 1979 values.6 We can then compare
this simulated value to the actual 1979 value, interpreting the difference as

inequality.

Such analyses can be performed for changes in an income source

CV2 or changes in a correlation coefficient between income sources; however,
since the income source shares must sum to one, a change in any one share
must be accompanied by a change in at least one other share.
In the following subsections we analyze the components of changes in
married couple income inequality using the CV2 decomposition outlined above
for a breakdown based on five income sources for the United States, Canada,

and Australia. The income sources are husbands' earnings, wives' earnings,
other earnings, interest and dividend income, and other income (which
primarily includes government transfer payments and pension income).

fl United

States

Table 2 shows the structure of family income inequality in the United
States in 1979 and 1987. It does this by reporting income shares and squared
coefficients of variation for the five income sources, and correlation
coefficients between these sources, for the United States in 1979 and 1987.

6This effect can also be estimated using 1987 values of the decomposition
equation parameters. As the two estimates will not necessarily be equal, we
calculate and report both sets below.
7Changes in the distribution of one income source may also affect the
distribution of other income sources. For example, changes in the inequality
of husbands' earnings could affect the distribution of wives' earnings or of
other earnings. By itself, the CV1 decomposition provides a simple mechanism
to account for changes in income inequality, It does not identify behavioral
linkages between different income sources.

These statistics were calculated using the 1980 and 1988 March Current
Population Surveys, and correspond to reports of annual income in the calendar
yeats preceding each survey.

Several notable changes in the components of family income inequality in

the United States occurred during this period. The &

up by husbands' earnings fell by 5 percentage points, with the share made up

by wives' earnings increasing by the same amount. The major change from 1979
to 1987 in the relationships between income sources was the increase in the
correlation coefficient between husbands' and wives' earnings from 0.01 to

0.11.8
The statistics in table 2 are computed using zero incomes for a
particular income source whena family receives no income from that source.
This fact impliSs that our results for changes in the dispersion of husbands'
and wives' earnings may differ from those derived from a sample that is
limited to individuals with positive earnings (as in Blackburn and Bloom 1987;

Burtless 1990; Karoly 1993). A major difference between the inequality
statistics reported in table 2 and corresponding statistics reported in
earlier research is our finding that the coefficient of variation of wives'
earnings (zeros included) decreased during the 1980s, while earlier research
(using positive incomes only) found that earnings inequality among women

increased. The decline in earnings inequality among our sample of wives can
be entirely attributed to an increase in the percentage of wives with positive

8Cancien, Danziger, and Gottschallc (1993) also discovered an increase in
the correlation coefficient between husbands' and wives' earnings in the
United States during the 1980s, although their findings suggest that the
increase occurred only among white couples.

earnings.9 This increase in wives' employment would also be expected to
increase the correlation coefficient between the earnings of all husbands' and
wives' •

but

this change does not account for much of the increase in the

correlation coefficient (for example, the interspousal earnings correlation
coefficient among families in which both the husband and wife have positive
earnings increased from 0.10 to 0.18).

Table 3 presents summary statistics that relate to our analysis of
changes in the level and structure of family income inequality from 1979 to

1987. As described earlier, these statistics are calculated by changing
selected components in equation (1) from their estimated 1979 value to their
estimated 1987 valuà, while holding all other components fixed at their

observed 1979 values. For example, if all components of the decomposition

same numbers for the subset of the population with positive incomes. Using
the additive decomposability property of the squared coefficient of variation
(see Bourguignon 1979), we can write CV2 as:

Using the fact that y —

Assuming that changes in p1 leave CI4 unchanged (that is, that the
distribution of earnings among wives entering the labor force is the same as
that for wives already in the labor force), it follows that increases in p1

lower cv2. With CV—. 66 in 1979 in the United States, the increase in p1 from
0.61 to 0.69 accounts for all of the fall in the ci?
(CV—. 66 in the United States in 1987 also).

11

for

wives' earnings

stayed constant at their 1979 values except for the squared coefficient of
variation for husbands' earnings (which increased from 0.42 to 0.48), the
overall CV2 would have increased by 0.028, a magnitude equal to 62 percent of

the actual increase in the overall &.

Similarly,

with other parameters held

constant, the increase from .01 to .11 in the correlation coefficient between
husbands' and wives' earnings would have increased the overall

CV2 by 44

percent. The fall in CV1 for wives' earnings accounts for a small decrease in
income inequality (although the magnitude

is

roughly twice as large if 1987

base parameters are used, partly because the share of income from wives'
earnings was larger in 1987 than in 1979).

The effect of changes in income shares on inequality is positive but

small, especially if 1987 base components are used in the decomposition. Most
of the impact appears to be caused by the increased share of income coming
from interest and dividend income (and the fall in the share from other
earnings), as the size of the effect from shifts in income shares is smaller
if only the changes in the shares of husbands' and wives' earnings are

consideredj° Unfortunately, the magnitude of the income share effects is
quite dependent on the values of the other components of the decomposition, so
any statements about the effects of shifts in shares are tenuous.

accounting for the measured increase in CV2. For the most part, the
structure income inequality, and the changes in that structure from 1979 to
198?, are similar in Canada and the United States.

In Canada, the two major

forces leading to increases in faintly income inequality are an increased

dispersion of husbands' earnings and an increased interspousal correlation of

earnings. The fall in the CV2 of wives' earnings — caused completely by
increased employment probabilities1 as in the United States —

offset

these

two forces to some extent. In addition, the change in income shares also
suggests a decline in income inequality in Canada, largely because of the

increased share coming from government transfers. This was not the case in
the United States (See Blackburn and Bloom 1993)

Housing Survey and the 1985/86 Income Distribution Survey.

changed very little after 1987, with overall inequality stable between those

years. Although, the correlation between husbands' and wives' earnings did
not change, both the inequality of husbands' earnings and the share of income
made up by wives' earnings increased from 1979 to 1987.

12

We also perform the cv2 decomposition for several additional countries

using data sets available as part of (LIS).13 The US income data differ
conceptually from the income data we have been using, as LIS researchers have

made several adjustments to take noncash benefits into account.14 Results for
four countries'withLIS data from the late 1970s to the early 1980s are
presented in table 6. Overall income inequality among married couples
increased in the early l980s in France and the United Kingdom, but not in

Sweden. The Netherlands also did not experience an increase in inequality
from 1983 to 1987, although unlike our other comparisons, the Dutch comparison

is of a recession year (1983> with a nonrecession year (1987). Changes in
husbands' earnings inequality differed considerably across countries, with an
especially large increase for the United Kingdom (even compared to the United

States, Canada, and Australia), and again a decline in the Netherlands. All

12The increase in the inequality of husbands' earnings (perhaps caused by the
recession) appears to have been offset by a continued decline in the
inequality of wives' earnings.
'3For more information about the LIS, see Smeeding, O'Higgins, and Rainwater
(1990).

14The LIS data for the United States, Canada, and Australia are actually drawn
from the same household surveys we use. However, the US data contain only a
randomly sampled fraction of the survey for the United States and Canada. We
also performed our decomposition using the LIS data for the United States for
1979 and 1986. While the actual magnitudes of the decompositions are
different when compared to table 2, the general pattern of the changes over
time are quite similar in the two analyses.

14

the countries experienced an increase in the share of income from wives'
earnings, although this increase was much larger in Canada and the United
States than in the other countries.
Less evidence supports the universality of increases in the correlation

between husbands' and wives' earnings. This correlation increased in Sweden
and the United Kingdom, both for all couples and for two-earner couples, but
in France (as in Australia), the increase was not observed among two-earner
couples, and in the Netherlands the correlation coefficient actually declined

for all couples. At least a loose correlation appears to exist betweenchanges
in the interspousal correlation of earnings and increases in husbands'
earnings inequ.lity, as some evidence of an increase in both is apparent for
every country except the Netherlands, where both fell.

II. The Relationship between Rusbands' and Wives' Earnings
The results of the previous section point to an increase in the
correlation between husbands' and wives' earnings during the 1980s as an
important factor associated with increases in family income inequality in

several countries. The purpose of this section is to examine this result more
closely for the United States and Canada, for which we have data on labor

supply of individual family members. In particular, we wish to discover
whether the increased correlation of earnings reflects an increase in the
correlation of husbands' and wives' hourly wages or in the number of hours

worked. Is it a consequence of changes in the process by which men and women
sort themselves into married couple units, so that men with characteristics
that tend to be well rewarded in the labor market are more likely to be

married to women who also possess such characteristics? Or have changes in
the structure of the relationships between individual characteristics and

15

labor market outcomes led to increases in the correlation of husbands' and
wives' earnings?

in this section we focus on the logarithm rather than on the level of
earnings to facilitate our analyses. Let EH_wRHE represent annual earnings

for husbands. and E_wH annual earnings for wives.

The covariance of log

earnings between husbands and wives can be written:

+ COV(ln

While we take note of the changes in the last two terms of equation

(2),

we

focus our attention primarily on changes in the first two terms on the
right-hand side of equation (2), the interspousal covariance of log wages

and of log hours. We analyze changes in these two covariances both
unconditionally md conditionally on a set of regressors that are fairly
standard in the estimation of wage and labor supply equations.

residuals.17 Similar expressions exist for the hours and employment equations.
One hypothesis of interest to us is that changes in the similarity of

husbands' and wives' labor market characteristics might be the cause of
increases in the correlation of husbands' and wives' earnings. This could be
the result, for instance, of technological changes in household production
that have reduced the incentive for specialization by husbands and wives.
While the periods on which we focus may appear somewhat short, rates of
marital formation and dissolution, as well as simple aging, are sufficient to
suggest the possibility of considerable turnover in the husband-wife pairs

couples eligible for inclusion in our 1979 samples (for the United States and

For the U.S. data we define our hours variable as annual hours worked
and our wage rate variable as annual earnings divided by annual hours worked.2°
The top panel of table 7 reports the variances of the logarithms of wages and
hours and the covariance between the log of wages and the log of hours
separately for husbands and wives in 1979 and 1987.21 For husbands both the
dispersion of wages and the dispersion of hours increased in the l9BOs, .zhile
for wives the dispersion of wages increased, but the dispersion of hours fell.

The correlation between hours and wages increased slightly for both husbands
and wives during this period.

The bottom panel of table 7 reports interspousal correlation coefficients
for earnings-related characteristics and for earnings and their components in

1979 and 1987. As with the correlation between the levels of husbands' and
wives' earnings, the correlation between the logarithms of husbands' and

a minimum-level wage restriction (see appendix A, item 10), there are somewhat
fewer observations for wages than for hours.

wives' earnings increased during the period. This increase was largely the
result of an increase in the interspousal correlation of log wages, as the

correlation of log hours did not change.22 There was also an increase in the
employment correlation from 1979 to 1987. However, focusing on the
interspousal correlations of earnings-related characteristics, we see no
change in the correlation coefficient for education, and a slight decline in
the correlation coefficient for age.

Least-squares estimates of reduced-form equations for employment, annual
hours worked, and wages are reported for husbands and wives in table Cl of
appendix C.23 The most notable change front 1979 to 1987 in the coefficient
estimates for the husbands' equations is the increase in the importance of

schooling to wages for both husbands and wives. The age coefficient estimates
also changed between years in most equations, revealing an increased tendency
for older husbands to work less compared to younger husbands, and for younger
husbands and wives to earn relatively lower wages.
Table 8 reports interspousal correlation coefficients of predicted

22There was also an increase in r(ln w,ln H) from -.08 in 1979 to -.06 in
1981, and in r(ln w,ln H) from 0 to .04.
23

The independent variables in these equations include the individual's
education, age, region of residence and number of dependents (that is,
nonearners) in the family. In the wage equation, education is assumed to
enter as a spline function (as in Card and Krueger 1992) with a shift in the
slope allowed at eight years of education, while age is entered as a
quadratic. As wages enter the employment and hours equations, these
specifications for age and education (for both spouses) are preserved in the
employment and hours equations for each spouse. Table Cl reports
the coefficient estimates for the husbands' age and education variables in the
husbands' labor-market equations, and the coefficients for the wives' age and
education variables in the wives' equations.
We also estimated wage and hours equations for wives in which we made
standard selectivity corrections for being employed (see Heccnan 1979). Our
coefficient estimates were virtually unchanged by this modification, and the
estimates of the error covariance between the wage (or hours) equation and the
probit equation were small and insignificant.

increase in the correlation between the wage

This result arises because

the residual correlations receive much greater weight in determining the
overall change in the wage correlation, a consequence

of the fact that the

residual variajices tend to be much larger than the variances of the predicted

values (see equation ti) This result also explains why the large increase
in the interspousal correlation of predicted

hours is not associated with an

increase in the observed interspousal hours correlation.

The stability of the interspousal age and education correlations suggests
that the increase in the interspousal predicted

coefficients and by an increase in the residual correlation, and not by the
formation of marital unions that are more homogeneous in terms of wage-related

characteristics. By contrast, the increase in the interspousal

correlation of

hours is caused both by changes in coefficients and changes in the independent
variable relationships, which suggests that part of the increase in the
correlation of hours may be a result of changes in the homogeneity of marital
unions with respect to hours-related characteristics.

Canada and Australia
Our definitions of employment, hours, and wages are slightly different
for Canada and Australia than for the United States because of the nature of

the available data. For Canada and Australia we use average weekly earnings
for workers who usually work full-tine as our wage variable, and weeks worked

during the year by full-time workers as our labor supply variable. For
purposes of constructing an interspousal education correlation, we imputed a
value for years of education using educational codes available in the data.
The components of the variance of log earnings and the interspousal
correlations of labor market characteristics and outcomes are reported in

table 9. The variance of log wages for husbands and wives increased in
Canada, but changed very little in Australia, where the increased dispersion
of husbands' earnings (and the decreased dispersion of wives' earnings) is

attributable to changes in the variance of labor supply. The interspousal
correlation of education increased in Australia, but not in Canada, which is a
curious result given that the increase in the correlation of earnings and
wages was larger in both Canada and the United States.
We repeated our analysis of changes in the hours and wage correlation
between spouses for Canada only, because there was little evidence of an

22

increase in the hours and wage correlations in Australia.24 Table C2
in appendix C reports the coefficient estimates for the 1979 and 1987

employment, weeks, and wage equations. The coefficient estimates for the
husbands' equations demonstrate that differences in husbands' labor supply
were more closely tied to education in 1979 than in 1987; however, unlike in
the United States, wage-schooling relationships remained fairly stable from

1979 to 1987. In contrast to their husbands, wage differences associated with
education widened sharply from 1979 to 1987 for Canadian wives.
The interspousal correlations of predicted values and residuals for the

three labor market equations are reported in table 10. The entire increase
in the overall'correlation between spouses in employment, and much of the
increase in the correlation in weeks, is a result of increased correlation in

the predicted values. However, the interspousal correlation of predicted
wages actually fell slightly from 1979 to 1987. In this case, the increase in
the interspousal wage correlation is entirely caused by the increase in the

interspousal correlation of the wage equation residuals. Increases in the
predicted value correlations for employment and weeks are mainly because of
changes from 1979 to 1987 in the coefficients for those equations, and not
because of changes in the similarity of spouses' labor market characteristics.

III. Discussion
Income inequality increased during the 1980s among families headed by a

married couple in several industrial nations. Our results also reveal that
the increase in income inequality among married couple families is closely

correlation decomposition is more reliable for Canada than for Australia.

associated with increased earnings inequality among husbands in families
headed by a married couple.
In the United States, the rise in husbands' earnings inequality is linked
to the widening of their education-earnings differentials and somewhat less

closely to the steepening of their age-earnings profiles. However, these
changes only explain a portion of the increase in husbands' earnings
inequality in the United States.25 Changes in education-related earnings
differentials were much smaller in Canada and Australia during the 1980s, and
so can explain almost none of those countries' increases in husbands' earnings
inequality.

Although the inequality of husbands' earnings increased in Australia,
Canada, and the United States, our analyses reveal some striking cross-country

differences in the processes generating those increases. For example, among
United States and Canadian husbands, increased earnings inequality is
associated with increases in both the variance of wages and the variance of
labor supply, but among Australian husbands, increased earnings inequality is
associated with an increase in the variance of labor supply, but not in the
variance of wages (which actually declined slightly between the two survey
years).

This pattern of findings lends itself quite readily to interpretation.
During the 1980s, the United States, Canada, and Australia all experienced a
shift in employment from their high-wage industrial sectors to their low-wage

service sectors. Industry's share of employment decreased by 4 percentage
points in the United States, Canada, and Australia from 1979 to 1987.26 Some

255ee Blackburn (1990) and Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993).
26The United Kingdom, which appears to exhibit even larger increases in male
earnings inequality and education-earnings differentials than the three

24

investigators have argued that these declines relate at least partly to the
increased flow of world trade and to corresponding adjustments in the world

division of labor.27 Some have also argued that changes are taking place in
the nature of economic activity within these countries, with industrial

production becoming more capital- and technology-intensive, and therefore

more skill-intensive (for example, see Leontief 1982). The decline of
industrial employment, the acceleration of technological change, and the
escalation of average skill requirements in the industrial sector would be
expected to strengthen the relative demand for skilled workers in an economy,
thereby possibly contributing to an increase in earnings inequality.28
However, even If one accepted the view that common forces were acting to
increase the inequality of male earnings and family income in the United
States, Canada, and Australia in the 1980s, why would the effects of these

countries under study here (see Katz, Loveman, and Blanchflower 1993). also
experienced the largest decline in industry's share of employment from 1979 to
1987 (9 percentage points). Japan, by contrast, exhibited a negligible change
in manufacturing's share of employment and a very small increase in
education-earnings differentials (see Katz and Revenga, 1989).
27Murphy and Welch (1998) discuss these issues further and provide evidence
related to the United States economy. Alternatively, Baumol, Blackman, and
Wolff (1985) argue that a decline in manufacturing's share of employment in an
growth in the
economy is a consequence of inherently faster productivity
manufacturing sector relative to the service sector.
Findlay (1993) constructs a general equilibrium model in which increased
openness of trade can lead to a decrease in the relative demand for
less-skilled workers. Ehagwati and Dehejia (1993) argue that recent patterns
in U.S. international trade are not consistent with such a decrease, and so do
not contribute to the increase in earnings inequality. Their empirical
argument is partly based on evidence from changes in the relative prices of
imported and exported goods.

the case of the United States, Blackburn (1990) and Juhn, Murphy, and
Pierce (1993) provide evidence that sectoral shifts account for a portion of
increased male earnings inequality between the late 1960s and the mid-1980s.
Kruger (1993) and Mincer (1993) provides evidence that the acceleration of
technological change in the l980s contributed to the increase of
education-earnings differentials in the United States.

25

forces manifest themselves so differently across these countries with respect

to the components of husbands' earnings inequality? One possible explanation
relates to differences in the nature of the labor markets in the three

countries under study. In particular, wage determination in Australia is
fundamentally a centralized and authoritative process, with minimum wage rates

for each occupation determined by state and federal wage tribunals. In
addition. Australian workers are highly unionized: the unionization rate was
58 percent in 1980 and 56 percent in 1987. By comparison, wage determination
is relatively decentralized and unregulated in the United States and Canadian

labor markets. In addition, relative to Australia, the unionization rate was
low in Canada in the 1980s (36 percent in both 1979 and 1987) and even lower

in the United States (25 percent in 1979 and 17 percent in 1987). Minimum
wages also fell sharply in real terms in the United States during the l980s,
diminishing any relevance they may have had to the determination of labor
market outcomes for prime-age men.
In line with these differences in the nature of each countries' labor
market institutions, our results suggest that market forces play a weaker role

in wage determination in Australia than in the United States or Canada. The
variance of husbands' earnings increased in Australia not because of an
increase in the variance of husbands' tiages, which actually declined slightly,

but because of an increase in the variance of husbands' weeks worked. In
addition, the rising covariance of Australian husbands' wages and weeks worked
suggests that employment declined relatively more for low-wage workers, a
finding that is consistent with the various factors identified above as
potentially leading to increased earnings inequality.29

290ne might

speculate

that these effects for Australia, which are based on

26

In the United States and Canada, however, the increased inequality of
husbands' earnings is associated with increases in both the variance of

husbands' wages and the variance of their hours, as one would expect to be the

case in relatively decentralized and unregulated labor markets. The fact that
the dispersion of wages appears to have increased more in the United States
than in Canada is consistent with a stronger union presence in Canada, but
also with the fact that education-earnings differentials for men increased in

the United States, but not in Canada.3° This latter difference appears to
reflect a sharp rise in the supply of more educated men in Canada during the
1980s relative to the United States (see Freeman and Needels 1993).
After the 'increase in husbands' earnings inequality, the increasing

correlation of husbands' and wivest earnings is the next most important
correlate of increased income inequality among married couple families in the

United States and Canada. We also find evidence that this correlation
increased in Sweden and the United Kingdom, but not in Australia, France, and

the Netherlands. Our analyses show that the increased interspousal
correlation of earnings in Canada and the United States is associated with
increased interspousal correlations of wages, hours, and employment

probabilities. Civen the increases that occurred in women's labor market
activity in the United States and Canada during the l980s, one might
reasonably expect these increased interspousal correlations to reflect some

samples of husbands who report that they usually work full-time, would be
even more pronounced among samples of all male workers.
30Comparing the magnitude of the wage inequality increase in the United States
and Canada may be misleading, because different measures of the wage are used
in analyzing the two countries. Blackburn and Bloom (1993). however, show
that the earnings inequality increase is larger in the United States than
in Canada when weekly earnings for full-time workers, are analyzed in both
countries.

Indeed, the data indicate that the interspousal correlation or predicted

For example, increased education-wage

be associated with an increase in the

In part because standard sets of regressors explain relatively small
fractions of the total variation in wages and hours,

the dominant factor

associated with increases in the interspousal correlations of wages and hours
are increases in the correlations between spouses of their wage residuals and

of their hours residuals. This result closely parallels the findings of
Blackburn (1990) and Juhn, Murphy. and Pierce (1993),

who note the importance

of changes in unobservable influences on wages to the rise in wage inequality

among United States men. Our results confirm the importance of changes in
unobservable influences in wage and hours equations to the increasing variance
of husbands' and wives' wages and hours in the United States and Canada. They
also suggest that these unobservable influences have become more highly

correlated between spouses over time. If our findings about the stability of
interspousal correlations of observed labor market characteristics extend to
unobserved characteristics, our results suggest that changes have occurred in
the weights that translate unobserved characteristics
outcomes, for example, that skill prices

into labor market

associated with certain labor market

characteristics not controlled for in our analyses tended to increase in the

19805.31 However, this conclusion is highly speculative and deserves further
analysis using data that will permit a richer specification of spouses' labor

market characteristics. Additional analysis of income and earnings data for
other countries and time periods is also needed before more definitive
conclusions may be reached about the ways in which

labor market institutions

help condition an economy's wage and employment responses to important
macroeconomic shifts.

3tJuhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993) use similar logic to interpret increases in
the residual variance of wage equations for U.S. men in the l980s. These
authors conclude that the widening of education-wage differentials is largely
a result of increased prices for unobservable skills.

calculating this statistic, the share of income from husbands'
was reduced by the amount of the increase in the share of income from earnings
wives'
earnings, while the other income source shares were left unchanged. This
convention preserves the constraint that all income shares sum to unity.

Appendix B
Effect of Changes in Wage Equation Parameters on the Correlation
Between Wages across Individuals
In this appendix, we consider how changes in the parameters of two

wage (or hours) functions can affect the correlation of the two function
outcomes,

To begin with, we assume that only one variable (for example, years of
schooling) enters the two wage functions, that is,

w1 —
—

where the erroi tens are omitted so as to focus on the correlation in
predicted values from the usual wage equations. Then the correlation
between w1 and w2 is:

C(x1,x2)

p —

olx

—

flu
2x

1

2

axx
a
1

2

where C(x1•x2) is the covariance between x1 and x2, °y is short-hand for
the standard deviation of a variable y, and p is the correlation

coefficient between w1 and w2, As p simplifies to the correlation
coefficient between x1 and x2, changes in ft1 and ft will not affect p, but

changes in the correlation between x1 and x2 will.
This result changes, however, when more than one variable determines

wages. For instance, let the variables
that is:

—
—

]!l
fi2x2

+

+

ll
•12z2

and

enter the wage equations,

Now, the correlation between w1 and w2 is:

P:lldltzl)

can either increase or decrease p, depending on the

signs and sizes of the relevant parameters. In fact, the above formula
leads to the following conclusion: if fl>O, then Op/Oft1 will be positive
(negative) if the percentage of the covariance between w1 and w2 that is

attributable to terms involving x1 is greater than (less than) the
percentage of the variance of w1 that is attributable to terms involving
(If

then the opposite conclusion holds.) An immediate

implication is that, holding other variances and covariances constant, an
increase in the covariance between

and x2) will increase the likelihood that increases in ft1

between
ft2)

will

and x2 (and so the correlation

(or

increase p.

32The portion of the variance of w1 attributable to

is defined so that

one-half of the covariance terms involving x1 are said to be attributed to
and the other half attributed to the other variable involved in the
covariance.
