INTERSTATE CIGAREITE
BOOTLEGGING: EXTENT, REVENUE
LOSSES, AND EFFECTS OF
FEDERAL INTERVENTION
ABSTRACT
In this paper, we develop and estimate a model of commercial smuggling in which some,

but not all, finns smuggle a portion of the cigarettes they seu. The model is used to examine
the effects on interstate cigarette smuggling of the Contraband Cigarette Act and a change in the

federal excise tax. We fmd thai both policies have unintentional effects. While the Contraband
Cigarette Act was imposed to reduce interstate smuggling, we find it had the opposite effect. In

contrast, an increase in the federal tax is not intended to affect smuggling, but we fmd it
increases the portion of cigarette sales that is commercially smuggled.

I. Introduction
Within the last year. substantial increases in cigarette taxes have been either proposed or
legislated at both the federal and state levels. The Clinton administration called for a 75 cenL per pack

increase in the federal tax, and a Congressional subcommittee recently proposed an increase of $1.01 per

pack. Ã§vera1 states have already legislated increased cigarette taxes. Whether these increases are
intended to reduce smoking or raise revenue, their success will depend on the extent to which firms and

consumers respond by increasing their tax evasion efforts. It is not surprising, then, to find concerns in
the popular press over increased cigarette smuggling.'
Not since the late 1970s has there been such concern over cigarette smuggling. In the early to
mid seventies, interstate cigarette smuggling was serious enough that several states appealed to the
federal government for assistance and the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR,
1977) recommended federal legislation prohibiting the interstate transportation of contraband cigarettes.
In response. Congress passed the Contraband Cigarette Act (CCA) of 1978 which prohibited single

shipments. sale, or purchase of more than 60.000 cigarettes not bearing the tax indicia of the state in
which they are found. It is commonly believed that smuggling declined significantly after this and that
the decline was due to the federal intervention:
The Commission concludes that the incidence of cigarette smuggling has declined significantly
since 1977. due in large part. to the passage of the Federal Cigarette Contraband Act in 1978.
(ACIR 1985, p. 4).
Thus. until the recent movement to increase taxes. cigarette smuggling had ceased to be a major policy
issue.

With existing models, however, it is difficult to assess the impact on interstate smuggling of

either the CCA or the proposed federal tax increase. In this paper. we develop and estimate a model of
commercial smuggling which allows us to examine both policy issues. Estimation of commercial
smuggling is important for the analysis of both policies, and it is a major difference between our study
tFor example, see The Wall Street low-nat, March 30 ("Tax cut spins Canada cigarette sales") and April 5, 1994
('Canada's Taxing Pols Outwitted by Underground Economy") and The Chicago Tribune. March 31. 1994 "Fewer
smokers or more bootleggers?". Groups expressing concern range from health advocates and government officials
to the Tobacco Institute, which has an incentive to discourage legislators from increasing taxes.

and others.

The bulk of the literature on smuggling focuses on casual smuggling by consumers who

cross state borders to take advantage of lower taxes in border states.2 It is unlikely that the CCA could
have affected this type of smuggling because it pertained to single loads in excess of 300 packs. This

most likely omits even the most avid smoker among consumers who smuggle. It is also unlikely that a
changejn the federal tax would affect consumer smuggling across state lines. An increase in the federal
tax might. affect consumer smuggling across national borders, but that is not our primary interest. Our
interest is interstate smuggling by firms. and any impact of the federal tax in our analysis occurs through
its effect on firm costs (and, therefore, equilibrium industry behavior)
In Section [1 we deveLop a theoretical model in which firms smuggle itt order to evade excise

taxes in a high (ax state. Firms choose the quantity of cigarettes to sell in a given state and the portion of
sales on which to pay the state tax, takIng as given the behavior of rival firms, the manufacwrer's price.
and enforcement parameters. The equilibrium we examine is one in which some firms pay lax on all

sales while others smuggle a portion of their sales in order to evade the state tax. The portion of taxpaid sales in the state is a function of the state tax, the cost associated with acquiring and camouflaging
smuggled cigarettes, expected penalties in the event of failure, as well as market parameters.
hi Section III we derive an empirically estimable version of this function. In addition to the factors mentioned above, the estimation procedure involves estimating consumer demand. This allows us to
account for the types of smuggling done by consumers, namely casual smuggling across stale borders arid
smuggling from military bases and Indian reservations. The model is estimated using annual data from
1972-1990. This period contains both the enactment of the CCA in 1978 and an increase in the federal
excise tax in 1983, enabling us to examine effects of both policies. Sections IV-VI report those results.
as well as revenue losses associated with commercial smuggling.

Contrary to the ACIR conclusion, we find Federal entry into contraband cigarette enforcement
had the opposite of the intended effect. According to our estimates, commercial smuggling increased
slightly in 1979 and fell in the early eighties, but it would have decreased in all years and the decrease
2See, for example. Balcagi and Levin (1986), Baltagi and (Joel (1987), Hamilton (1982),.Warner (1982), and
Manchester (1973) The ACIR (1985) study discusses commercial smuggling, but it does not distinguish between
commercial and casual smuggling in its estimation.

would have been even greater if the act had not been passed. While this may seem surprising, we argue

in Section IV that it can be explained in terms of a combination of factors related to the reaction of
enforcement agencies to passage of the law.3 Section V shows the results are robust to alternative nonconstant elasticity variants of the model. Section VI reports the other somewhat surprising result, that art
increase in the federal excise tax increases the portion of cigarettes smuggled. To understand the result,

recall that our model includes finns who smuggle a fraction of their sales and firms whose sales are
entirely legal. An increase in the federal tax increases costs for both types of firms, leading to a reduction

in their equilibrium sales. As shown in Section VI, an increase in the federal tax will be associated with
an

increase in the portion of cigarettes smuggled for a sufficient reduction in sales by nonsmuggling

firms. Section VII concludcs.
As noted earlier, the literature on cigarette smuggling tends to focus on casual smuggling by
consumers. In contrast, the literature on smuggling in international trade is primarily devoted to models of

smuggling by firms. The model closest to ours is Thursby. Jensen, and Thursby's (TJT. 1991) model of

camouflaging, in which sonic. but not all, firms in a market pay tariffs on a portion of their imports in
order to camouflage smuggled imports. Although the focus of their theoretical work is imports, they

present empirical evidence on the relevance of the model to interstate cigarette smuggling in the United

States. We differ from TJT in two respects. In the theoretical analysis, we make assumptions on the tax
structure and eriforcenient that are more appropriate to the cigarette case. In addition, we derive an

empirically estimable smuggling function that allows for estimation of the extent of smuggling.

IL A Theoretical Model of Commercial Smuggling
In this section. we present a model of cigarette distribution in which some. but not all, firms

smuggle in order to evade state excise taxes. We adopt 'firs assumptions on market structure and the
form of smuggling. but we differ in the treatment of taxes and penalties for tax evasion. Finns who
smuggle are able to evade taxes on only a portion of their sales because tax-paid sales are necessary to
3Warner (1982) noies that any decline in smuggling in the early eighties could have been due to the reduction in
real tax differences that occurred with increasing rates of inflation. However, as with the ACIR (1985) study,
Warner does not estimate the extent of commercial smuggling.

camouflage &nuggled cigarettes. The market is quasi-competitive in that a finite number of firms compete
as Coumot rivals, but as the number of firms increases, output and price approach the competitive

outcome. Each firm makes its decisions taking as given its rivals' behavior, the manufacturer's price. tax
structure, and government enforcement. K is in modeling the last two parameters that we deviate from

TJT. Their theoretical analysis focuses on smuggling when firms face ad valorem taxes and the only
penalty for smuggling is confiscation. These assumptions are inappropriate for our case since cigarette
taxes are per unit and penalties include fines andlor imprisonment in addition to confiscation.4

Consider the decision problem of the ith cigarette distributor who purchases cigarettes either
front the manufacturer or from an out-of-state wholesaler for sale in state s. The state government levies

an excise tax ofT5 per unit sold. If the firm pays the tax on all units sold, its profits are

(1)

[P(Q) âw âci âTÃ§âT5]q

where P(Q) is inverse demand facing firm i. Q is the quantity of cigarettes sold by all finns in s, w is the

manufacturer's price, I is the federal tax, c is cost associated with transportation and/or retailing, and q
is the quantity sold by firm i.
Alternatively, the firm may try to avoid paying the tax on (1 â))q of its sales and report sales of

liqi, where y c 1 is the portion of sales on which it pays the state tax. In reality, this can occur in a
variety of ways, but a common one is for a firm to purchase (I âyj)q cigarettes from a wholesaler in a

low tax state,j, paying T per unit plus a premium to the wholesaler not to affix tax indicia to the cigarettes (ACIR, l985), The smuggling firm then affixes counterfeit indicia for tax payment in S.

4Dara front the ACIR (1985) suggest that state penalties are relatively low. Fines appear more prevalent than
prison sentences, and stare fines appear lower than those for a federal conviction. Our results for 1979-1984 show
that the value of confiscations was less than one-tenth of one percent of estimated values for the amount
smuggled..

5Athough some cigarettes are hijacked. we do not model hijacking. Tax administrators we interviewed indicated
that they receive manufacturers' accounts of cigarettes sold to distributors, making it difficult to smuggle
cigarettes purchased from the manufacturer. The mechanism we model is harder to detect, and enforcement
evidence suggests it is a common method.

5

Enforcement efforts make this a risky activity. We incorporate this aspect of smuggling by introducing a
parameter, e. to denote the level of enforcemenL and we express p. the probability firm i success fi.illy

smuggles a unit, as a function of e. Iris also natural to assume this probability is a function of the
portion of its sales the firm attempts to smuggle. We assume pQ, e) is increasing and concave in â¢yj and

decreasing, and concave in e. in addition, p(, e) E (0. 1] for all yj. p(O, e) = 0 for all e. and

p(l. e) = p(t 0) = I. As noted earlier. finns caught smuggling are subject to fines, imprisonment, and
confiscation of cigarettes. We assume expectations are rational, so that (I â p(.)) is the true fraction of
finn i's sales that are detected and confiscated. Thus, expected profit for a firm who tries to evade taxes in

s are given by

The parameter a is included to differentiate firms by their ability and cost of smuggling. One could think of ai representing

the wholcsaler,6 it may pay a lower premium than others. Managers may also differ in their ability and

implies that firms sell a homogeneous product. Even though cigarettes are differentiated, this specifica-

Aggregate data also preclude our distinguishing between wholesale and retail sates, hence our model will

IlL An Empirical Model of Commercial Smuggling
In this Section we develop an empirically estimable ftmction for tax paid sales in a state as a frac-

lion of total sales (legal and illegal) in the state. Although this function is similar 1071*. it takes into account issues of estimation and data availability not considered in our theoretical analysis. In Section A
we derive an estimating equation that allows us to account for the fact that market data reflect smuggling

by consumers as well as the commercial smuggling of interest to us. We also explain the variables used
to reflect taxes and enforcement parameters. Section B is devoted to a discussion of data and the estimation procedure.

9

A. Estimating Equation

We address three types of cigarette smuggling.9 First, "casual" smuggling is done by consumers
in high tax states who cross state lines to purchase cigarettes in low tax states. The second type is the
sale of tax free cigarettes on American Indian reservations and military installations to non-Indians and

non-military personnel. This smuggling, like the first, is thought to be primarily smuggling by consu.rners.

Organized or commercial smuggling by firms is the third type, and the one targeted by the CCA.
This type of smuggling often involves firms purchasing tax-paid cigarettes in low tax states and is the
type modeled in Section II. Note that with this type of smuggling, cigarettes are legal in the state where
they are purchased because the low tax state's excise tax is paid. However, the wholesaler in the low tax
state is paid not to affix the local tax indica. The primary sources for such cigarettes are the tobacco
producing (and lowest tax) states North Carolina and, to a lesser extent. Kentucky and Virginia. Table 1
presents the per capita tax paid cigarette sales is these three out-smuggling states as well as the U.S. average for selected years. Smuggling is not thought to have been a problem in 1965 when the largest difference in taxes (excluding local taxes) with other states was $.46 (in 1990 prices) and few states had differ-

ences larger than S.30. Per capita sales in KY and VAtO for 1965 are similar to the U.S. average. By
1970 many states had tax differences close to $.40 and per capita tax paid cigarette sales in the three out-

smuggling states had risen well above the U.S. average. The primary reason for this rise is thought to be
the increasing tax differentials.
We start with a standard cigarette demand function which treats cigarettes in neighboring states
as a substitute for "local" cigarettes, arid which accounts for the presence of non-tax paid sales on military

bases and Indian reservations. Our initial demand equation is

Mail-order sales of cigarettes are an additional source. Such smuggling is thought to be of minor importance
(ACW 1977; Maltz. Edelhurtz. and Chamberlain (1976) report mail-order smuggling to be on the decline) since
mail fraud statutes apply 10 the activity and because of the difficulty in smuggling large quantities of cigarettes
while, at the same time, avoiding detection by postal authorities.

Data on NC are unavailable as only data on tax paid sales are gathered and NC did not tax cigarettes in 1965.

The parameters 5 allow for a different constant term for each state. A fixed effects model is estimated in

order to adjust for any demographic differences across states that might lead to different cigarette de
mand; we assume that demographic changes over our sample period were unimportant with respect to
cigarette demand. We allow for heteroscedasticity by assuming a different disturbance variance for each
state. Below we relax the constant elasticity assumption with respect to price and income.
A time trend is included to account for (apparent) declines in cigarette smoking due to advertised
adverse health effects; the sign of its coefficient. Il3 is expected to be negative. AVRP5t and CAN5t are
measures of the incentive for consumer to cross borders to purchase cigarettes. States with cigarette
prices generally lower than that of their neighbors will observe higher demand (ceterisparibus) for cigarelies due to out-smuggling of cigarettes by consumers from neighboring states; the opposite occurs irt

II

states with prices generally higher than their neighbors.1' We do not have available information. on average retail prices in Canada hence we use tax rates. AVRP (CAN) are introduced In ratio with RP (local

state tax rate) simply for ease of presentation: by doing so we can interpret Pi as the price elasticity of
demand net of any cross -bordering smuggling by consumers.12 Canada and neighboring states enter
separately because of the added difficulty in crossing the US/Canadian border. Data on Mexico arc unavailable, and, in addition, we can find no mention of smuggling across the USfMexican border as a
problem.
MILITARY5tXInTAX5t arid INDIAN5tXIflTAX5t are included since sales of cigarettes on Indian

reservaLions and military bases are free of state taxes. and military bases and indian reservations have

often been mentioned as a source for smuggled cigarettes. Tight control of sales on military bases (e.g..
sates only to military personnel or dependents and Limits on the number of canons sold to a consumer)

would suggest that any smuggling off military bases would be casual. It is not clear whether smuggling
off Indian reservations is done solely or primarily by consumers. We assume that casual smuggling is

the primary form of this smuggling)3 Large indian and/or military populations should lead to decreased
demand for cigarettes sold through tax paid outlets, but total demand will be higher since cigarette prices
are tower ott bases and reservations and this may spill over into tax paid cigarette sales (our observed

quantity). In addition, it is well known that cigarette smoking is more prevalent among the military than
among civilians. For these reasons we are unable to hypothesize signs on 136 and 13j.

11 We also considered the ratio of taxes in neighboring states as well as retail prices in neighbonng states
because smuggling by consumers is confined primarily to what might be loosely temied weconomicN regions
where factor costs are similar. In the area where a casual smuggler operates one could argue Iliac price
differentials are due primarily to tax differences. That is. a price difference that leads to casual snuggling is a
difference due primarily to lax differences rather than to price differences stemming from, say, differing labor
costs. Results using the two measures are very similar so we only repon the results based on prices (which is the
measure typically used by other researchers).
12
Only the standard error of the estimate of {3 is affected by using ratios.
This assumption should have little, if any, effect on our estimates of the extent ot' organized smuggling since
our measure of the incentive for organized smuggling is the difference in a states excise tax with the excise tax in
North Carolina which remained at two cents throughout our sample period. if we were to introduce separately the
incentive for firms to smuggle off Indian reservations we would use the local state tax rate which is almost
perfectly collinear with the tax difference with North Carolina.

12

Data available on cigarette sales are art "tax-paid" or "legal" sates: we only observe the portion

of the ith states cigarette demand for which the ith state's taxes are paid In the absence of commercial
smuggling we would observe Q (which. of course. reflects the demand or supply of cigarettes from
neighboring states). In the presence of commercial smuggling we observe the portion of sales that are

legal. Define y, 0 <y 1, to be the fraction of demand in the sth state in year t which is not supplied
or "bootlegged" into the state by commercial smugglers. In equilibrium Yst equals tax-paid sales as a

fraction of total sales in the stateJ4 That is, we observe 4t =

iQt rather than Q51 (or Yst)' where L is

the per capita quantity of legal sales in state a in year t. Substituting the accounting identity Q a t-st +

S5 into the above, where S5 is the level of commercial smuggling in state s at time t, we solve for the
level of organized smuggling activity as

(11)

S5 L5t(l Yst)'Yst'

Yst is unobserved, but it is estimable, its theoretical analog is a function of the level of enforcement as
well as the tax differential with the low-tax states. The functional form chosen is

ENFORCE = the level of enforcement (representing E1 in the theoretical model),

and w5 is a random error assumed to be distributed N(0, a,).
Enforcement level is unobserved, but it is a function of a set of observable variables. We consider this below, though we note for now the reasonable assumption that ENFORCE is equal to zero if

TAXDIF = 0. A quadratic in TAXDIF is used to account for possible nonlinearity in the effects of tax
differences,

We choose an exponential form for Yst as well as interact the random error and RP with TAXDTF

because this implies, as it should,

=

1 (that is. no commercial smuggling) if the lax difference with the

low tax state. and hence the incentive to smuggle (and to enforce against smuggling), is zero. Recall that
in the theoretical model Ti * is a function of the equilibrium aggregate sales in the state

Note, how-

ever. in equation (4) the effect is shown to be through the inverse demand equation. Hence we use RP5

in place of Q5. Our analysis does not imply a sign on the coefficient of RP. Also recall that the direct
effect of an increase in TAXDIF on 71 * is negative, but that an increase in TAXDIF also changes total

sales of smugglers and non-smugglers, These latter effects can outweigh the direct effect so that the net

effect is positive. It is nonetheless our expectation that increases in TAXDIF reduce Tst (t <0).
Our measure of the tax differential, TAXDIF5t, is the difference between the tax rate in the sth

state at time t and the tax in North Carolina at time t. As noted above, many of the cigarettes smuggled
by firms are "legal" at the point of origin: that is, smuggling firms pay the state excise tax in North
Carolina, Kentucky, or Virginia. The nominal taxes in these three states were unchanged during (he pe-

dod of our observations at 2, 3, and 2.5 cents. respectively. Since North Carolina is considered to be the
primary source of smuggled cigarettes we measure the incentive for firms to smuggle using the difference
in the local state excise (axes and the excise tax in North Carolina. Results change very little if we use
the slate excise tax rate rather than the tax differential given a constant nominal North Carolina tax rate.
In the theoretical model the effect of enforcement is unambiguous. so that we expect Ã¶3 > 0. As
the level of enforcement rises the proportion of legal sales to quantity demanded. 1st. should increase.
However, enforcement is itself a function of the Lax differential: an increase in the tax differential increases the incentive for states to engage in enforcement activities since the returns to enforcement activity are potentially greater. There is little direct evidence available on the level of anti-smuggling enforce-

ment Other than the tax differential, our evidence includes the date of passage of the Contraband
Cigarette Act, the fact that some states were members of joint enforcement operations, some qualitative
information on the severity of penalties for smuggling, and the rebate offered to wholesalers for each le-

14

gal sale.15 The joint enforcement groups were the Interstate Revenue Research Center (IRRC). with
member states MI, MN. IN. IL, OH. FL. and MS. and the Eastern Seaboard Interstate Cigarette Tax Enforcement Group (ESICTEG). with member states CN. DE. MD, MA. NJ. NY. and PA. The information

on the severity of smuggling penalties is from ACIR (1977) where states are categorized as having light,

moderate, or severe criminal penalties for smuggling. The states in the latter two categories are CA. CIt
MI. NE. NY. Old, and Th. Benjamin (1992) aregues that the payment of a discount or rebate to

wholesalers for each legal sale is a form of enforcement Ostensibly. the discount is to cover the cost of
affixing the tax indica. but it is widely agreed that the rate is substantially in excess of the cost of stamping the cigarettes and is therefore a disincentive for smuggling.
We account for the level of enforcement using the function

is a year after 1978 (i.e.. a year in which the Contraband Cigarette Act was in

effect), 0 otherwise, or

15

Pan of the reason it is hard to measure accurately enforcement activities by state is that enforcement is
undertaken by both state law enforcement and tax agencies. The relative importance of these agencies in
enforcement activities varies from state to state (ACIR. 1977). See also the discussion in MaUi., Edeihurta, and
Chamberlain (1976, especially pages 23-24).

The first specification of the period in which the Contraband Cigarette Act was in effect imposes a quad-

ratic structure on the time effects of the Act, while the second specification allows the effect to "freely"
vary over the twelve year period. We shall refer to the first (second) model as the CCA-1 (CCA-2)
model. If correct, the first specification is more efficient than the second; however, evidence presented in

ACW (1985) and given in private discussion to the authors suggests that enforcement activity varied
substantially during the SO's. We shall return to this below.
In (12) interaction with TAXDIF is used so that the level of enforcement is zero if there is no in.

increase the level of enforcement (a3> 0) and that more severe penalties for smuggling will also have a

positive effect on enforcement (c4 > 0). The effect of the passage of the Contraband Cigarette Act is

generally considered to be an increase in thelevel of enforcement.

used in (13) and (11), provides estimates of the extent of commercial smuggling in each state.
Before proceeding to estimation, severaL points need to be made. FUst, the coefficients of(12).

forcement in the equation fory. which is presumed positive. Second. the coefficient of TAXDWSL the
sum of a (presumed) positive, unidentified coefficient (si)' and the product of two positive, unidentified
coefficients (53 and at), hence TAXDIF5t's coefficient cannot be signed a priori. Likewise. the coeffi-

cient of TAXDIF5 is a combination of unidentified coefficients and cannot be signed. Finally, the vailances a,,, and 0v are not identified.

B. Data and Method of Estimation
We estimate (14) using annual data from 1972 - 1990 for 39 states plus the District of Columbia.

Our data exclude observations on states with local government excise taxes (AL, IL MO, Ni. NY, and

TN) since the information needed to calculate art effective In nit is unavailable (see also lIT). HI and
AK are excluded since smuggling of cigarettes for these states may be of a distinctly different characteristic given the necessity of ocean travel or travel through Canada when hauling cbntraband cigarettes.
Observations on NC. KY, arid VA are exduded since they reportedly sources of commercially smuggled
cigarettes. The data are a total of 760 observations (T=19 and N=4CD. In Table 2 are the mean values of

per capita in paid cigarette sales, price, and state tax levels (both in 1990 prices) for the 40 states in our
sample for each of the 19 years.

It is well known that the usual fixed effects (within) estimator (that is, ordinary least squares. In-

strumental variables, generalized least squares. etc., estimators ot(14) after diffeztncing the data from its
"time" means to remove individual effects 5) is inconsistent for fixed T (number of time periods) when
the regressors are not all strictly exogenous. Strict exogenelty fails here because of the presence of the

lagged dependent variable on the right hand side of (14). Hence the preferred approach Is to estimate

17

(14) after quasi-differencing the data to remove individual effects (see Holtz-Eakln. Newey, and Rosen

(L983) and Wooldridge(1991)). This view presumes large N and small (and fixed)T. In the present

context. N is fixed (and fairly small) while I is not (at least conceptually) fixed though It Is small. Hence
any appeal to consistericyfor eli/icr estimator must reside on the notion that I can potentially increase

without limit; thus neither the usual estimator orestimation afterquasidiffeziencing would appear to
dominate. We stick with the usual fixed effects estimator.

and Q! (and hence L51) are simultaneously decennined so we use Instrumental variables. In
addition, we allow the possibility that 1st and ENFORCE51 are stochastic by including the disturbances

w5 and 'st- lf 1st and/or ENFORCE5t are indeed stochastic this implies that the disturbances In (14) are
the sum of a heteroscedastic disturbance, Eg. and a heteroscedastic MA(l) process, u51XTAXDIF5t

All other elements of the covariance matrix are zero. Since the errors are correlated through time Lj
and RP5i are not independent of the disturbance. To obtain consistent estimates of the parameters of

(14) requires, in addition to an instrument for RP5t, instruments for L.5tj and 11stj. However, if

=0

the problem with the endogeneity of L1 and RP51.j disappears.
We begin estimation by testing for the presence of heteroscedasticity in (1) the UsEdue to hetero-

scedasticity in the fraction of legal sales equation (13), and in (ii) the demand equation (10). We use a
likelihood ratio test comparing the alternative model

We test for heteroscedasticity using both definitions of CCA1 (models CCA- 1 and CCA-2). and

we estimate (14) both imposing and not imposing the non-linear restrictions among the coefficients. This
gives a total of four tests. As instruments for both retail price and lagged legal sales we use their pre-

dictS value from regressions on the other right hand side variables in (14) as well as lagged income and
two period lags of income and TAXDW: the current, one-period lagged. and two-period lagged state
cigarette tax rate: the current, one-period lagged. and two-period lagged manufacturer's price to wholesal-

ers plus the federal excise tax rate: a dummy variable equal to one for the years when the federal excise
tax was 5.16 and 0 for those years when it was 5.08: and an index of the wage rates of grocery store
workers as well as the one and two-period lags of the index. The results of the four tests is a rejection of
the null model (18) at any reasonable significance level: the largest p-value is 0.0001.

We then tested model (17) venus a model without fixed effects (that Is, model (17) venus the

tested (17) venus the null model vu =

(LM) tests which are simply the tests for significance of the coefficient of W in (17). 18 The results are
mixed. The p-values for Model CCA- t are both larger than 0.32 while the p-values for CCA-2 are 0.062
and 0.161. Since results are mixed, we estimate the model without the restriction

t7This lest Is similar to the Lagrange multiplier tests suggested by Breusch and Pagan (1979) and While (1980).
See also the discussion in Godfrey (1988, pp. 188-190) and references therein regarding application of

'

heteroscedasticity tests in models with endogenous regressors.
Note that the null value (a2 0) lies on the boundary of the parameter space: however, in this case. the LM
statistic is still valid in large samples (Breusch arid Pagan 1979).
19 We
also obtained estimates after imposing the restriction that the variance of ust is zero. Not surprisingly, it
makes almost no difference in the results for Model CCA-l.

19

The estimation method is generalized non-linear 2SLS (see. e.g.. Ainenilya, 1985, pp. 240-24!).

IV. The Level of Smuggling and Enforcement Results
A. Parwnerer Estimates
Estimates of model (14), after imposing the non-linear restrictions among the coefficients, are

found in Table 3. The naming of wad ables is done in an obvious shorthand. Only CAN is Insignificant
in both models. Of the remaining coefficients, only INDIAN has a sign that is counter to our intuition.
Price and income elasticity magnitudes are appealing given the addictive nature of smoking. They tend
to be tower than estimates reported elsewhere. Lcwiu and Coate (1982) and Wasserman. ci. a!. (1990)
review a number of prior studies and report that estimated price elasticities are in the range -.23 to -1.30.
Turning to the variables associated with lst' we first consider the null hypothesis that all coeffi-

cients of the variables in

are jointly zero; that Is. we test whether = I Vs and I. The p-values for

each of the tests are very close to zero, hence we reject the hypothesis that all are Jointly equal to zero.
The coefficients of TAXDIF and TAXSQ are jointly significantly different from zero at standard signifi-

cance levels for CCA- I and are jointly significantly different from zero at the 11% level 1t CCA-2. Recall, however, that their coefficients are combinations of unidentifiable parameters and thelrslgns are In-

determinant, hence, significance or a lack of significance is a moot point. MEMB,FELONY, DISC and
RI' are significant only in Model CCA-2. In that model, the coefficient on membership in anti-smuggling organizations has. as expected. a positive effect on the proportion of legal sales, but the coefficients
of FELONY and DISC have signs counter to our expectations.
Recall the quote given earlier attributing reductions in smuggling In the early 80's to passage of

the Contraband Cigareue Act. Our estimates imply the contrary. Holding other factors constant, passage
of the act Is assoc ated with a fall in the proportion of legal sales. Smuggling activity did appear to fall
during the early SO's (see below), but not in response to passage of the Act. In Model CCA- 1. the coefficient of the linear term (CCAxTAX) associated with the years 1979-92 Is different from zero at standard

significance levels, and the coefficient associated with the quadratic term Is close to being significant at
the 10% level (they are also jointly different from zero with a p-value very close to zero). The linear co-

20

efficient Is negative and the quadratic coefficient is positive. The overall effect on the proportion of legal
sales is negative: evaluated at mean regressor values for the period 1979-1990 (the non-zero values for
the CCA term) the quadratic form is negative. Using a different dummy variable (interacted with

TAXDIF) for each year the Act is in effect (CCA-2) shows a negative effect on y for all years except for
1985 (for which the effect is positive but insignificant). For all other years except 1986-87. the estimated
coefficients are significant at the 10% leveL A joint test of whether all the coefficients of these variables
are zero has a p-value close to zero.

What could account for this apparent, and counter-Intuitive, effect of the passage of the Contraband Cigarette Act? if we accept the reasonable position that an increase in enforcement Increases the
proportion of legal sales, then we are left with the result that passage of the Act lowered enforcement.

Several hypotheses are possible. but consider the following points. First, broadly speaking, enforcement
activities arc undertaken by two groups: law enforcement agencies and tax administrators. Testimony
before the ACIR clearly indicated the Importance of both groups for effective enforcement. The federal
agency responsible for implementation of the Act, the Bureau of Alcohol. Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF).
cannot supply the second type of enforcement since it is a law enforcement agency. Its personnel are not
tax auditors, and they are allowed to examine records of suspected smugglers only by court order.
Second. the ACIR (1985) expressed concerns ".. that some states are using federal actions to justify
reducing their rote in enforcing cigarette tax laws." The ACIR concluded that state enforcement efforts
were reduced after the CCA because both the presence of the federal government in enforcement and the

perception that smuggling was lower reduced the returns to state enforcement efforts. Think beginning
in 1980, the federal government began attempts to reduce or etiminate funds appropriated for enforce-

ment of the Contraband Cigarette Act (see ACIR, 1985). We vere told by state tax administrators that
the ATF currently does not allocate any efforts to*ard enforcement. The smuggling problem is believed
to have disappeared and the states have been told that the AW will reinstate enforcement efforts if the

states feel smuggling has agate become a problem. Finally, these administrators claim that. by and large,
cigarette smuggling Is not delectable unless an agency Is actively looking for smuggling -

21

Based on the above we hypothesize the following as an explanation of the adverse effect of
passage of the Contraband Cigarette Act. Many states reduced enforcement activity because of the presence of federal enforcement activities. The ATF, being only a law enforcement agency, and not an
agency of tax auditors, is less effective per dollar spent on enforcement than are the states which have
both law enforcement and tax auditing capabilities. Beginning before passage of the Act, smuggling

activity had been declining and continued to dedine after a jump in 1979 (we turn to this below) leaving
the impression that the ATF was indeed quite effective. With the Impression that smuggling was
disappearing, the states did not search for smugglers, and hence were not in a position to determine the
adverse effects of the AcL

B. Level of Smuggling and Revenue Effects
Estimates of the parameters of the

function permit estimation of the level of commercial

smuggling. Estimates are presented in Table 4 under two scenarios. In the first we estimate commercial
smuggling implied by Models CCA-l and CCA-2 (the "With CCA" columns of Table 4). We then itestimate smuggling assuming that the Contraband Cigazene Act was never passed. In the latter experi'

ment we set to zero all variables associated with the Act for aD years rather than just the years prior to

1979 (the "Without CCA" columns of Table 4); that is, CCA1 = 0 V t, The columns titled "%Smug" In
Table 4 give the average values of the percent of total sales (IOOx(l -1st)) commercIally smuggled Into

the 40 states in our sample for each of the 19 years. Presented also are the estimated standard errors for
these averages (columns "SE"). The standard errors are based upon the standard errors for the estimated

parameters. Asymptotic statistical theoiy suggests normality of the estimated ys. Also presented art
the average per capita packs of cigarettes smuggled in the 40 stases (columns Smug). For sonic states

and time periods the value of i' is greater than one implying no smuggling. The columns "%Smug" are
based on the estimated value of y regardless of whether or not it is above or below one: this allows for a
correct estimated variance. However, the columns "Smug" are calculated by setting to one any value oty
in excess of one. This change is relevant for Model CCA-2 for which about 20% of the estimated ys are

greaterthan one.

22

Smuggling activity was generally declining from 1972until 1979 when it takes a jump before
continuing its downward trend before turning up in the late 80's. In the absence of the Contraband Ciga-

rent Act there would not have been a jump in 1979. Model CCA-l (Model CCA-2) implies that smuggling was higher in 1979 by about two (one) packs of cigarettes per capita due to changes following pas-

sage of the Act. Note in Model CCA-2 that estimates of the percent smuggled are not significantly different from zero in years 1985 and 1986.
In Table 5 are presented revenues as well as revenue losses for the 19 years in our sample. Here

again we set to one any value of yin excess of one. "Revenue Received" is the total revenue received by'
the states in our sample. "Revenue Lost" is the amount that would have been received in the absence of
organized smuggling. "Ratio" is the ratio of Revenue Lost to the sum of Revenue Lost and Revenue Received. We also compute the values in the absence of the Contraband Cigarette AcL The Implied
aggregate revenue losses for the period 1979 - 1990 due to reduced enforcement after passage of the Act

is 5828 million and $1,103 million for Models CCA-l and CCA-2.
Are the smuggling numbers reported in Tables 4 and 5 reasonable? In the 1985 ACIR report it is
claimed that cigarette tax evasion had declined 45% between 1975 and 1985. Our estimates of the decline in smuggling based on Models CCA-1 and CCA-2 (using columns Smug) are 28% and 49.%, re-

spectively. The number reported by the ACifi includes all foams of smuggling for all stales while ours is
an estimate of the decline in organized smuggling for the 40 states in our sample. On the revenue side,
the 1977 ACIR report claims a loss in 1976 of 5900 million (using in 1990 dollars) in tax revenues from
all forms of cigarette smuggling. Their figure includes gains to those states that attract consumers from
neighboring states. Our estimate of the loss from organized smuggling is 5635 million and $278 million
for Models CCA- I and CCA-2. respectively. If all contiguous states except KY, NC, and VA are included, our estimates of the losses are $865 million and 5313 million for Models CCA-l and CCA-2. respectively. These last figures, of course, do not include losses on local cigarette taxes.

23

V. Nonconstant Elasticity Models

Wasserman, a. at, report evidence suggesting non-constant price and income elasticities of demand for cigarettes. Their regressions use not only income and the log of puce, but also those variables
interacted with a time trend.2Â° We alter our empirical models by introducing the interaction of the time

trend with the logs of price and income. We refer to these new models as CCA-lt and CCA-2t. The
regression results are in Table 6. Wasserman, ci. at. found that the estimated income elasticity of demand went from positive and significantly different from zero in 1970 to negative and Insignificant in

1988. They further report that consumers became more sensitive to prtce as time passed. Both Models

CCA-lt and CCA-2t imply a falling income elasticity of demand. However, the evidence in the two
models concerning the price elasticity of demand is contradictory. Table 7 gives the elasticity by year
and model along with the standard error (or the elasticity (columns "SE"). In every case the puce and income elasticities of demand are significantly different for zero at commonly used significance levels.
Note that the coefficients of TREND in both CCA-lt and CCA-2t are positive (though only mar-

ginally significant in CCA- it). This implies that, holding constant other factors that influence cigarette
consumption and allowing for nonconstant price and income elasticities, cigarette consumption has been

increasing over time. This effect is counter to commonly held beliefs about changing cigarette habits.
Tables 8 and 9 report the smuggling and revenue effects of smuggling for the models with

trending elasticities. The evidence on smuggling and us revenue effects are very similar to that observed
with the earlier models. In particular. there is a jump in smuggling associated with the passage of the

Contraband Cigarette Act.

VI. Federal Excise Taxes and Smuggling
It has been proposed by the Clinton administration (and others) that the federal excise tax on
cigarettes be raised from the current 24 cents per pack to anywhere from 50cents to $2. The purpose is
not only to raise federal revenues but also to discourage cigarette smoking.

20Note, however, that Laughunn and Lyon (1971) report no such interaction effects.

24

What effect might these proposed increases have on commercial smuggling? In the development
of the theoretical model we showed that the federal tax affects sm.uggling only indirectly through its

effects on equilibrium sales. With the exception of linear demand, an increase in the federal tax has an
ambiguous effect on the level of organized smuggling. In our empirical model this tax is embedded
(enters) in the retail price term which appears both in the demand equation (10) and the legal sales

equation (12). An increase in the excise tax. all else equal. will increase price, hence an analysis of
changes in smuggling pre and post 1983. the only year in our sample in which the federal excise tax was

changed. might shed light on the effects of federal taxes on organized smuggling. Unfortunately, we are
unable. with the model as expressed above, to separate changes in retail price due to, say, shifts in labor

costs, from changes due to excise tax changes. To remedy this we rn-estimate (14) after introducing the
federal excise tax directly into they function (12). This allows us to measure the effect on the level of
legal sales of a change in excise tax. holding constant retail price. The fact that we now introduce the

excise tax as well as retail price does not imply misspecification in the models estimated earlier. This
follows from the fact that the excise taxes were included in our earlier models, albeit indirectly. Note
that we cannot simply enter the excise tax as one regressor and the difference between the retail price and
the excise tax since, in general. only a portion of the tax will appear in the price term.
Models CCA- 1. CCA-2. CCA- It. and CCA-2t were reestimated after introducing the level of the

federal excise tax into the y function. In every case the coefficient of the federal excise tax was negative
and significant implying decreases in the proportion of legal sales with increases in the federal excise tax.

While federal tax collections might well rise, state collections will fall. The implied elasticities ofywith
respect to the federal excise tax ranged from -.031 to -.076. We continue to find that passage of the
Contraband Cigarette Act is associated with an increase in smuggling.

Although our estimate of 1t differs somewhat from its theoretical analog, the theory is useful for

understanding why y might decrease with an increase in the federal tax. Recall that y5 =(71 *Nlql* +

N2qzuJ4Nlql* + N2q2*J. Since the sign of aqj*/aTf is ambiguous. any empirical result is consistent
with the theory. However, if demand is linear or not too convex, &q MTfc 0 for i = 1.2. This is the
intuitively expected result since an increase in the federal tax increases per unit cost of both smuggled

25

and legal units sold. In this case. 1st will decrease for N fixed, if the response of a legal trader is greater
than that of a smuggler. Although it is not included in our theoretical model, an increase in the federal
tax may induce firms to exit, in which case lst is more likely to decrease if N2 decreases more than N1.

VU. Concluding Remarks
In this paper we develop a theoretical and empirical model that permits estimation of the level of
organized smuggling of cigarettes out of the low-tax and cigarette producing states NC, KY. and VA.
The level of smuggling, as well as the generally decreasing trend in that level, accords well with evidence

presented in the 1977 and 1985 ACIR reports. We find two important policy results. First, passage of
the federal Contraband Cigarette Act did not deter smuggling, as has been claimed. Those who have
claimed success for the Act interpreted the general decline in cigarette smuggling from levels in the 70's
to much lower levels in the 80's as evidence of its success. We find, however, that the decline was not
due to passage of the Act, Rather, it followed from generally decreasing real levels of state tax differentials. In every model we estimate we find an increase in smuggling following passage of the Act; this
increase is then followed by a continuation of the downward trend in cigaretLe smuggling.

Second, we find that increases in the federal excise tax are associated with a greater proportion of
smuggled cigarettes. Proposed increases in the excise tax may well operate, as hoped. to raise federaL tax
revenues and lower the level of cigarette smoking, but it will also serve to increase the proportion of

smuggled cigarettes and thereby reduce state revenues. This result has not been anticipated by
government officials or previous studies of smuggling. Officials are clearly aware that changes in the
federal tax could affect consumers smuggling across the Canadian and Mexican borders, but our results

come from examining commerica] smuggling. Since previous studies have tended to focus on smuggling
by consumers, the effects we find have been unnoticed.
