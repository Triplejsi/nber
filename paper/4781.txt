AGGLOMERATION AND THE
PRICE OF LAND: EVIDENCE
FROM THE PREFECTURES

AB STRACF

We use Japanese prefectural wage and land price data to estimate the magnitude of

agglomeration effects in manufacturing and finance. We also examine the range of
agglomeration effects by estimating the extent to which they diminish with distance, using a
specification that encompasses the polar cases of purely local agglomeration economies, on the

one hand, and national increasing returns to scale, on the other. We fmd that agglomeration

effects are slightly stronger in financial services than in manufacturing, and that they diminish
substantially with distance in either sector. Our estimates indicate that agglomeration effects can
explain about 5.6 per cent of the growth in Japanese output per worker in manufacturing and

about 8.9 per cent of the growth in output per worker in fmancial services during 1976-1988.

Our estimates imply that, while the average elasticity of productivity with respect to
agglomeration is between 10 and 15 per cent, agglomeration economies in the largest prefectures
are nearly exhausted.

1. Introduction

A number of explanations of edonomic growth focus on increasing returns
to scale external to the firm as a source of increased productivity.1
External effects also play a central role in the

literature

on urban location,

where they provide an explanation for the existence of cities.2 Indeed, Lucas
(1988) notes the similarity of his explanation of economic growth and
explanations for cities:

1t seems to we that the 'force' we need to postulate for the central
role of cities in economic life is of exactly the same character as the

'external human capital I have postulated as a force to account for
certain features of aggregative development. If so, then land rents
should provide an indirect measure of this force,...(p. 39).

The two

literatures

differ in two

basic

respects, however. For one

thing, the growth literature has assumed externalities at the aggregate level.

while the urban literature treats externalities as local. Second, most models
of growth have not incorporated a productive role for land; all factors of
production except labor are reproducible. Hence there is no natural limit to
the supply of complementary factors available to an individual worker.

However, not surprisingly, land plays a central role in the urban literature.The competition among factors for scarce land in an

2Exsmples of models that focus on externalities at the urban level are Mills
(1967), Arnott (1979), Helpman and Pines (1980), and Henderson (1988).
Henderson (1987) surveys this literature.

urban location provides a centrifugal force to offset centripetal

agglomeration effects. Congestion effects explain the existence of multiple
cities and economic activity in nonurban locations. If agglomeration effects
are never offset by competition for scarce land then activity should converge
to a single point that would become a 'black hole' of economic activity.
Presumably the limitations on economic activity implied by finite natural
resources act as a constraint on economic growth as well.
Data on urban activity over time and across countries indicate a

strong

correlation between economic growth and urbanization. This relationship
suggests that the benefits of proximity increasingly outweigh the costs of
congestion as economies develop.'

The relationship between urbanization and growth has been attributed to

various interrelated factors.' One
and external to the firm,

is

local scale economies, both internal

industrial activity (as modeled, for instance, by

Henderson (1988)). Another explanation is that the increased specialization

of labor and differentiation of coodities associated with development make
trade at a central location more desirable (as suggested, for example, by

Diamond's (1982) models of search). The first argument

explains

urbanization

and city size by the development of particular industries. Sassen (1991), for
example, relates the most recent growth of New York, London, and Tokyo

to the

of international finance.' The second suggests that urbanization is

'Kuznets (1966, pp. 272.273) found that the per cent of the population living
in urban locations grew substantially between the beginning and the middle of
the twentieth century in all of a sample of twelve now industrialized
countries. Chenery and Syrquin (1975), applying pooled time-series
cross-sectional regression analysis to international data, found that the
population of a typical country became more than 50 per cent urban once its
per capita income exceeded $500 (in 1964 US $), and tapered off at 75 per cent
once per capita CNP exceeded $2000.

is Japan, where the Economic Planning Agency of the Government of Japan has

reported commercial and residential property values by prefecture since the
early l9lOs. Given the enormous rsnge in the intensity of land use across the

46 prefectures of the Japanese archipelago, these data provide an excellent
source of information on agglomeration effects. Our purpose here is to

exploit these data to measure the intensity and scope of the effects of
agglomeration on productivity.
We proceed as follows. In Section 2 we develop a model of industry

our results. We find elasticities of productivity

respect to local activity between 10 and 15 per cent in manufacturing and

between 12 and 20 per cent in finance. Our estimates of the elasticities with
respect to nationwide activity are about 2 to S per cent higher in each case.
For both sectors we find that the impact of agglomeration on productivity

diminishes

distance. Activity 10 kilometers away has half

less the impact of activity in the mnediate vicinity. The estimated

effect of agglomeration on productivity is within two per cent of the
theoretical maximum implied by our specification for the largest prefectures,

but

only about three-fourths of the theoretical maximum in prefectures with

the smallest agglomeration effects. Agglomeration influences the comparative

advantage of prefectures a. financial and manufacturing centers, and we
discuss how this comparative advantage has shifted over time. Our estimates

that increased agglomeration can explain about 5.6 per cent of the

section 5 discusses some implications of our results.
2. A Model of Prefectural Production and

Land

Rents

We first discuss the theoretical framework that we use to estimate the

extent and range of agglomeration affects in manufacturing and finance. As is
standard in much of the literature on externalities, we treat technology

the

at

plant level as linear homogeneous in the plant's inputs, but allow

productivity at the plant level to depend on the general level of activity at

nearby plants in that industry in the region. specifically, we measure the
agglomeration economies provided by prefecture p in industry I with the index:

'

extreme, if S —

agglomeration economies are purely local in nature:

Increased activity in neighboring prefectures creates no externalities. At

the other extreme ifS —0 then increased activity in this industry anywhere.
in the country increases productivity in prefecture p to the sane extent:
External economies are then nationwide.'
We introduce agglomeration effects into the production function as

"Cravity models of international trade employ a similar specification to
estimate trade intensity between countries: Intensity increases with the
product of the trading partners' incomes but diminishes with the distance
between them. Deardorff (1984) discusses the model and its origins.

differs, for example, from what i.

implied

by the Dixit-Stiglitz (1977) model

of product differentiation, which has been applied to urban analysis by Fujita
(1988). two simple aicroeconomic models that yield this specification are the
following:

'If production is Cobb-Douglas and all
elasticity

factors except land are mobile then the

of production with respect to urban activity must diminish for
cities of finite size to emerge. If external effects have a constant
elasticity that is lower than the land share then activity will spread out
evenly across space, while if the elasticity exceeds the land share it will
collapse to a single point. See Henderson's (1987) discussion.

.7-

Product Di.! I stan elation:

One model captures the same Smithian notion that productivity increases
with th. division of labor among plants as the Dixit-Stiglitz (1977)

framework. Specifically, say that the output y1 of plant I is a function of
the number of plants N in its industry from which it buys inputs to produce

its own output. In particular, let:

Yf

Le

If the minimum efficient plant size in the industry is 1i' then the number of

plants in a prefecture will be proportional to industry output. Say that the
output of a plant used as an input elsewhere is tradable at zero cost over a

radius r. Also assume that it is so expensive to trade the output over a
larger radius that it is not worth using elsewhere, If r has distribution
1-l/(l+Er)2, then the probability that that a plant will buy from another

plant a distance r awayis l/(l+&r)2. Together these assumptions imply the
specification that we use here.

Another

motivation for this specification is the superior knowledge about

market conditions provided by greater levels of economic activity. Say, for
example, that consumers desire a characteristic of a product •t

.

Plants

can embody any value of I

in their products at equal cost.

Producers form their beliefs about S by observing the price at which

products of different qualities are sold. The most recent observation
provides the best estimate of the current value of I, and will predict the
current value with variance c2t, where t

is

the time that has lapsed since

that transaction.

Suppose that the frequency of transactions in a prefecture is
proportional to economic activity in the industry there, with a share
1/(l+Sr)2 of transactions observed in a prefecture a distance r away. Under

these assumptions, finn in prefecture p will have a forecast error that is

proportional to l/ZY/(l+Ed)2.

The average value of their products will

fall as this forecast error rises according to the specification in equation
(2).

3. Data and Estimation

Our

task

is to estimate the parameters #.and & from Japanese prefectural

data. We do so not by estimating the production function in equation (2), but

by estimating the corresponding cost function. Cost minimization by firms
implies that prefectural external economies and prefectural production
amenities should exactly offset differences in factor costs across
prefectures.

Our procedure

is to relate prefectural factor cost to external

observations (46 prefectures over 13 years). All data are in 1980 real yen't.

We estimate the parameters

and for financial

services separately. Of the remaining sectors listed in Table 1, we remove
agriculture and mining from the analysis. Both contribute negligibly to
output and employment, and we regard the determination of their location.as

largely

independent

of the agglomeration and congestion effects that we

address here.''
Of the remaining sectors, we treat (1) manufacturing and (2) finance and
insurance as producing output that is primarily tradable among prefectures,

and subject to the external economies modeled in Section 3. We treat the
remaining 6 sectors as producing outputs that are nontradable, selling either

to businesses or to households within the prefecture. We assume that these
sectors produce at constant returns to scale at both the, plant and industry

levels, so are not themselves subject to external economies.

'°Prior to 1915 the sectoral decomposition of prefectural value added was not
consistent with the decomposition of the prefectural labor force.
ttWe obtained annual prefectural consumer price indices from various issues of
the Japan Statistical Yearbook.
'21n 1988 agricultural production was 2.7 per cent and mining was 0.3 per cent
of Japanese GDP. Japanese tax policy treats agricultural land that was in
agricultural use before 1950 very favorably relative to other land.
Agricultural land ii taxed at a lower rate than the standard tax and at 1.4
per cent of its assessed value. In most cases, agricultural land is exempt
from inheritance taxes. We treat conversion of agricultural land to other
uses as exogenous (determined, for example, by government policies) rather as
the outcome of market forces. (Nevertheless, the anticipation that policies
that protect agricultural land might be removed could have a significant
effect on nonagricultural land prices, in particular, tending to depress them
in prefectures where agricultural land is more plentiful.)

-10-

Local raceor Cost

We trBat capital as completely mobile across prefectures, so that plants

everywhere face the same cost of capital. Time effects thus pick

up the

of variations in the cost of capital over tine. Hence only differences

in wages and land rents create variation in local fActor costs across

prefectures. In order to obtain estimates of the cost of production by
prefecture for manufacturing

and

services,

then, we need to measure

wage and land rents by prefecture, and their local (direct and indirect)
shares in production.

Wages

Wages by industry and prefecture for the two traded and six nontraded
sectors are calculated as the average labor cost per worker.15

In

this case total

prefectural value added would provide the better measure of prefectural

activity. Another possibility is that prefectural boundaries have little
bearing on the range of agglomeration effects, in which case the density of
activity in the prefecture captures economies of agglomeration better than the
total level.

In fact, as we discuss below, the two

measures

yield similar estimates of

the scale of external economies. The total value added measure provides
somewhat better explanatory power and allows us to identify the role of
distance much more precisely.

A potential source of simultaneity bias is that unobserved prefecture

explanatory power for manufacturing than for finance, and for total value

added than for density. Since manufacturing is the larger sector for all of
the prefectures we consider, there is also more reason to think that

simultaneity bias is greater in this sector. For these reasons we place more
weight on the instrumented (IV) equations in the case of manufacturing and on
the uninstrumented (non-IV) equations in the case of finance, although we
report all sets of results.

4. Results

Appendix A reports the basic estimation results. We discuss four aspects
in turn:

(1) the effect of distance, or the range of agglomeration effects,

(2) the elasticity of productivity with respect to agglomeration at the local
and national levels, (3) the magnitude of agglomeration effects across
prefectures and industries, and (4) the contribution of increased
agglomeration to productivity growth both to individual prefectures and
nationally.

Dista,ic.

Table 3 reports, in its third column, the coefficient S on distance in

the agglomeration term for the various cases. A value of zero implies that
agglomeration effects are nationwide, corresponding to aggregate external
economies of scale, while an infinite value means that agglomeration effects

-16-

are purely local. Except for the case of finance with IV correction, the
estimated distance coefficient I is 0.06 or 0.07 for both manufacturing and

finance. The coefficient on distance in finance with IV correction is .03.
Table 4 reports the implication., of these estimates for the gradient of

the agglomeration effect. Infact, the range of estimates of & imply a quite
similar, and fairly steep, gradient. Moving activity a kilometer away from a
location reduces its contribution to productivity at that location by between
81 and 94 per cent of its impact in the immediate vicinity, while moving it

away 10 kilometers reduces its impact to between 39 and 57 per cent. Moving
activity 100 kilometer. away dilutes it. impact to only 2 to 6 per cent of its
local impact.22

We conclude, then, that agglomeration effects are substantially local in

character. Nevertheless, this range of estimates leaves room for substantial
productivity spillovers across prefectures, as we now discuss.

Pr.f.ctural and National Agglomeration Elasticities

Since the magnitude of the parameter # depends on units in which value
added is measured, we find it more instructive to report the elasticity of the

effect of activity on productivity implied by our estimates of # and S. Our
specification implies that this elasticity decline, as the overall measure of
nearby activity increases, however, so that the effect can vary substantially
from prefecture to prefecture. Hence we calculate the elasticities implied tji
our estimates for each prefecture at the average value of the agglomeration

22When density rather than the level of vilue added served as the activity
indicator, our estimate of & was very sensitive to IV correction. Without
correction the estimate was very high, implying virtually no spillovers beyond
the immediate vicinity, while with the correction the implied spillovers were
national.

variable during the period of estimation, table 5 reports the calculated
elasticities prefecture by prefecture. Note that they vary widely, and are
substantially lower in large prefectures. Table 3 reports the simple average
of the prefectural elasticities.

We report elasticities of two types. One we call the local elasticity,
which is the percentage increase in productivity at a location resulting from
a one per cent increase in activity at that location holding

all prefectures.

The presence of regional dties in the cost equations tends to reduce

size of the elasticities by between 3 to 8 per cent. This reduction is
not surprising since the 10 regional d*ies eliminate the contribution of
cross-regional variability to the estimation.
Instrumental variables correction reduces the estimated elasticities for
the

finance when total value added measures activity, and for both industries when
density measures

activity. This direction is expected since unobserved

prefectural characteristics that raise productivity in a prefecture will also

raise factor cost in the prefecture. Surprisingly, IV correction actually
raises the estimated elasticities slightly in manufacturing when total value
added measures activity.

Without IV correction, both the local and

finance

exceed those in manufacturing by 3 to 8 percentage points. Since

manufacturing for all prefecture., there is less scope for simultaneity bias

successfully than they explain financial CDP. For this reason we concentrate
more on the IV corrected equations in manufacturing and

equations in finance.

within U.S. manufacturing,

contrast, we find strong externalities within regions but less between them.

Together, our results suggest that location rather than specialization is a
much greater source of external effects,
The Exhaustion of Agglomeration Externalities

Table

6 reports the contribution of total agglomeration economies in each

industry in each prefecture, i.e. the value of ten exP(#/A

) where Ai is

givenin equation 1, at the beginning and at the end of the sanple. We report
these for the case in which regional dummies are included in (U), using the
IV-corrected measure of manufacturing activity and the non-IV corrected
measure of financial activity.
The agglomeration measure exp(.o/Ai ) has a theoretical maximum of 1.
Note that the measure for some prefectures is within one or two percentage

For manufacturing. Tokyo and Aichi

In finance, the largest agglomeration effects appear again for Tokyo now

followed by Kanagawa (Yokohama). Miyazaki prefecture in Kyushu,

and then

in Northern Honshu, report the lowest level of agglomeration

Relative agglomeration effects also contribute to the comparative

advantage of prefectures between manufacturing and finance. In Chiba and
Hokkaido, for example, the contribution of agglomeration to productivity is
about the same in manufacturing and finance, but in prefectures like Aichi and
Shiga, the contribution of agglomeration to productivity is about 3 per cent
higher in manufacturing than it is in finance.
Moreover, the contribution of agglomeration economies to comparative

advantage has shifted over time. Over the entire period externalities in
finance have grown by about three per cent in ICanagawa and only by one per

cent in manufacturing. In Aomori prefecture, however, manufacturing
externalities grew by about 9 per cent inmanufacturing, but only by about 5
per cent in finance.

Our functional form forces the contribution of aggloeration to

-20-

productivity to diminish with the agglomeration parameter A. To test whether
or not a diminishing agglomeration effect is implied by the data, we estimated
the model using the following variant of the production function (2):

obtained significantly positive estimates of

estimates of 02. For all values of $ that we considered, the estimated
coefficients imply an average agglomeration elasticity for Japan as a whole
similar to what we report here, and negative agglomeration elasticities for
the largest prefectures.

Agglomeration and Growth

Table 6 also reports the growth in the agglomeration measure during the

semple period for each prefecture. The CDP-weighted national average growth
in the manufacturing agglomeration measure is .17 per cent while the growth in

the finance agglomeration measure is .26 per cent. These measures compare
with an overall growth in output per worker of 3.0 per cent in manufacturing --

and 2.9 per cent in finance. Hence, agglomeration effects can account for a
small but nontrivial part of overall growth in per capita output in these
sectors.

5. Conclusion

This paper has used data on land prices and wages in the Japanese

prefectures to infer the extent and

range

of agglomeration economic. in

manufacturing and infinancial services. The main implications are that:

while the extent of agglomeration economies in both sectors ii
(with

(1)

significant

agglomeration elasticities of around 10 per cent or more), they are

fairly localized geographically. (2) ass conclusively we find agglomeration
economies to be larger in finance than in manufacturing. (3) Agglomeration
economies appear to be nearly exhausted in the prefectures
pronounced.

(4)

where they are most

The lowest observed measures of agglomeration economies imply

productivity levels that are about three-quarters of the highest observed

agglomeration economies. The exploitation of agglomeration economies can
explain about 5.6 per cent of the labor productivity growth in manufacturing
and 8.9 per cent of labor productivity growth in finance during the period of
our sample.

These results suggest an explanation for the increase4 concentration of

land prices in Japan

financial

based on the growth of the financial service sector, If

services tend to occupy localities with larger land areas, either

because of historical accident or because agglomeration effects are more
pronounced in these sectors, then an increase in the relative price of these
services in terms of manufactures will act to increase relative land prices in

larger areas. Of the ten regions in Table Al1 the Greater Tokyo region has
the

largest area of land that could b. used for building purposes,

the

followed by

As a consequence of higher land prices in these areas, and

2Other regions such as Hokkaido and Holcuriku have higher total land areas,
but most of this land is mountainous, forested, or agricultural and hence not
available for private development. Within the Tokyo region, even the

area than any others except Hokkaido and Aichi.
