WORK AND CRIME: AN
EXPLORATION USING PANEL DATA
ABSTRACT
In this paper we explore the relationship between crime and work using data for a cohort

sample of young men. We find that working and going to school significantly decrease the
probability of committing criminal acts and by virtually identical amounts. Parochial school
education and higher IQ are also significantly associated with lower criminal proclivities, but a
high school degree has no significant effect. These findings. in conjunction with other research,

suggest that participation in legitimate activities (employment or school) per se has a greater

effect on criminal behavior than does the higher income associated with employment or
educational attainment.

Beginning with thrlich's (1973) extension of Decker's (1968] pioneering
work,

economists have sought to mod.l the

nature

of the relationship between

employment and crime. These economic models generally see

crime

as

like

employment in that it takes time and producee income. The simplest of these
models predicts that crime and work are substitutes. The implication is that
increasing the availability of jobs and improving wages lowers the level of

criminal activity. Empirical researchers have been unable, however, to
provide strong, consistent and convincing evidence in support of this
theoretical proposition.

In light of these findings, we stepped back and surveyed empirical work,
including

on crime. This work provides important stylised

facts. First and foremost, crime is a young man's game.

In 1990, seventy

percent of the individuals arrested in the United States were between 16 and

34 and over 80 percent of those arrested were male, Second, during their

In thi. paper, we develop a model that reflects the above stylized facts
and use a date set that has a number of unique elements. Our data contains
information on the criminal, work and educational activitie, of a
representative sample of young males in a large U.S. urban area. The study
traced the activities of the young men from ages 19 to 25. This is the period

Beginning in 1980, a small, but increasing, number of etudie. used
individual, generally cross sectional data, to estimate economic models of
crime (e.g., Good, Pirog—Good

and Sickles,

1986;

Montsarqustte and Herb,.,

1985: Myers, 1983; Viscusi, 1986a, 1986b; Schmidt and witte, 1984; Witte,

1980). since this work relat.. most closely to our own, we concentrate our
review on this literature. For completene.s, we sl.o discuss briefly some
relevant work by

sociologists (e.g.,

Ros.i, Berk and Ianihan,

1980; Thornberry

and Christenson, 1984) and psychologists (e.g., Farrington, et .1., 1986;
Gottfr.d.on, 1985).

In the fir.t half of the 1980., a number of economists used data for
prison relsasses to estimate models of criminal activity (e.g., Witts, 1980

and Myers, 1983). This work often had limited information on employment
activities and no information on educational activities. For example, Mitt.

uses the length of time required for release.. to find a job and the wage on
the first job after release to ref l.ct work activities. She has no
information on

educational

activities. Further, studies using cross sectional

data for prison release.. cannot reveal how legitimate activities affect the

decision to coemence criminal activity. It can only reveal the effect of
employment on the resumption of such activities.

Christenson, 1984) contain no deterrence variables. Other studio address
specific but not general deterrence issues by including variables that reflect
the individual's perceptions or past experience with the criminal justice
system (e.g., Montmarquette and Nerlove, 1985; Myers, 1983; Schmidt and Witte,
19B4; Viscusi, 1986a, l986b; Witte, 1980).

crime by entering the gain, from crime, denoted R(c), directly into the

utility function. This reflects the fact that many offenses yield no direct
monetary gain (e.g., assault, drug use) and that even major property crimes
produce surprisingly low

monetary

returns (Petersilia, Greenwood,

empirical work. As represented in the model above, an individual

the individual faces a schedule or function that relates each possible

and Poterba (1987), it is possible to estimate the effect of the

crime only if there are exogenous shifts in the

schedule. Under the model developed above, such exogenous shifts occur

because of

differences

in individual abilities to avoid arrest and because of

differences in police resources, police administration and the legal code.
Variables reflecting such shifts and not the probability of arrest enter the
crime equation.

For notational simplicity, we ignore the possibility of multiple arrests

III. The Data and Emoirical Model

Our primary data

are for a 10 percent random sample of males born

and residing in Philadelphia between

in

1945

their 10th and 18th birthdays. We

combine this individual information with data on the total number of offenses,
police budgets, macroeconomic indicators and neighborhoods i.n Philadelphia.

Information was collected from school records, draft registration records, the
Philadelphia Police Department, the FBI, a compendium on city government
finances, the Philadelphia Coemunity Renewal Program, and interviews carried
out in 1970—1971.

Using this data, we created two panels, one a seven—year panel that
traces cohort members' activities from 1964 through 1970 and the other an
eight—year panel

conducted

that ends in 1971. since

almost half of the interviews were

in 1970, the seven—year panel contains approximately twice the

number of observations as the eight—year panel. The results discussed in the

estimate our model, we require measures of the total income from legal

activities, the preferences of the individual, and exogenous factors that
cause the probability or sanction functions to shift. There are two primary
measurement issues for this

study,

namely how to measure the level of criminal

activity and how to reflect the criminal justice system actions. We use two
measures of criminal activity. The first is a binary measure for whether or
not the individual was arrested during the year. Although this is one of the
most coanonly used measures of criminal activity, it is well—recognised that

estimate three specifications as a partial check of the robustness of results.
The implications of the Tobit models are similar to those of the probit model,

Tauchen, et al. (1988).
The probit and Tobit models are significant in all specifications and the

eetimated coefficients, when significant, are of the same sign in all models.
The estimated coefficients on the variables of primary interest are stable in
sign and magnitude across specifications for a given estimation technique.
We find greater time working, greater time in school and higher IQ to be
significantly related to lower probabilities of criminal activity. The
receipt of a high school diploma, however, has no significant effect on
offending for any specification or panel. Upon considering only the results
for the time allocated to work and IQ, we could interpret our findings as
indicating that a lower level of criminal activity is associated with greater
income." In light of the results for the high school degree binary and the
time allocated to school, the interpretation is less clear cut.
The coefficients on the proportion of time working and the proportion of
time school are not significantly different from one another. Other studies
(e.g., Farrington, et al., 1986; Gottfredson, 19851 Viscuei, 1986a) obtain the

surprising that young men

were more likely to be arrested in their early adult years. This is a con
result, however, in studies that use neighborhood or other aggregate measures

of income. In previous studies, researchers interpret the average cunity
income as measuring the opportunities for crime and often find this variable
to be positively related to the crime rate". The findings related to the
young mans juvenile criminal record and to the other family background
variables are aleo consistent with the previous literature.
We find robust and significant general deterrent effects from greater

criminal justice system resources. For the results reported in Table I, the
criminal justice resource variable is measured as

real

police resources per

offense for the city of Philadelphia, and the estimated coefficient is

negative and significant. We also find significant deterrent effects for the
following measures of criminal justice resource.: police officers per offense,
total criminal justice employee. (police, courts, and local corrections) per
offense, real police budget per young male, and real police budget per capita.

will offer greater insights regarding the effect of legitimate tae uses on

criminality. Researchers have begun to develop dynamic models of criminal
activity

(e.g.,

Tlinn, 19867 Davis, 1988) and models of crime based on

and sociological processes (e.g., Akerlof and Dickens, 1982;
Dickens, 1906; Lattimore and Witte, 1986; Lattimore, et al., 1992). Gary
Becker is currently developing models for the rational formation of

psychological

preferences baeed on habitual behavior and peer group influences Isecker,
