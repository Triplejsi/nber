NEW EVIDENCE ON
WORKPLACE EDUCATION

ABS1'RACF

This paper presents an analysis of the impact of a workplace education program that was

administered by a community college at two companies. One of the companies we study is in
the manufacturing sector and the other is in the servce sector. The analysis relies on longitudinal

administrative data and cross-sectional survey data. We examine a broad range of outcome
variables, including workers' earnings, performance awards, job attendance, and subjective
performance measures. Our main finding is that the program had a small, positive impact on
earnings at the manufacturing company, but an insignificant impact at the service company. We

also find that the training program had a positive association with the incidence of job bids,
upgrades, performance awards, and job attendance. At the manufacturing company, occupational

courses, such as blue print reading, had the largest impact.

Although an extensive literature exists on the effectiveness of public sector job
training, a much smaller literature exists on the impact of private sector job trsiriing on
workers' wages, productivity and other employment outcomes. Heckman, et.

a.1. (1993)

attribute this difference to a lack of data and a greater ease in receiving funds for studies of

public sector training. Nevertheless, several recent policy pronouncements call for the
encouragement of more private sector training in the hope that training provided directly by
employers will be effective. As an example, Burtless (1993) advocates a payroll tax to finance

such training. Public policy regarding private sector training would be on much firmer
ground if more were known about the return to investments in workplace training.

Most studies of public sector training generally find positive returns for female
workers, but small and some times negative returns for male workers and youths (see
LaLonde (1993) for a survey). On the other hand, the existing literature on private sector

job training generally finds that such training programs have a positive effect on labor

productivity. Bartel (1991) and Hoizer, et. al. (1993) conclude that employer training
increases labor productivity at the firm level. Using individual level data, Brown (1989), who

uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and Lillard and Tan (1986) and Bishop (1990),

who use the Employment Opportunities Pilot Prects Surveys (EOPP), find that on-the-job

training has a positive and significant effect on wages and reduces voluntary turnover.
However, these studies rely on responses to questions that combine many diverse training
programs, the relationship between the timing of the training and the current job is unclear,

and the questions often refer only to entry level jobs. Furthermore, there is potential bias
from nonrandom selection nto training. Lynch (1992). uses the National Longitudinal Study

of Youth (NLSY) and finds that off-job private training appears to increase wages
significantly, while the positive effect of on-job trnining on wages disappears in firstdifferenced equations that eliminate any permanent individual effect on wages. Bartel (1994)

analyzes a company database and finds that company training positively affects both wages

and performance evaluations for professional employees. With all of these studies, it is

unclear whether they provide relevant evidence on the types of private sector training
programs currently being advocated.
In this paper, we study the effect of an employer-based education program on a variety

of employment outcomes for individual employees. To perform this analysis we conducted
a prospective study of a standardized job training program that was offered at two mid-sized

companies (250-800 employees) in New Jersey. The workplace education program was

administered and designed by a community college, as is common (Bassi (1994)), and

subsidized by a grant from the federal government as part of the Workplace Literacy
Program. A strength of our analysis is that we use data from administrative company
records. We also supplement the company data with survey data that we collected from the

employees. Our data set has several advantages over past data sets used to study private
sector training. First, the key variable of interest, participation in the company training, is
based on administrative records from the community college that organized and designed the

training program. Thus, we have detailed information on the program as well as an
understanding of the content of the trnining. Second, we have collected information on a rich

set of employment outcomes, including wage growth, performance evaluations, and
absenteeism. Finally, the trAining was focused on low-skilled, hourly workers, who have been

hurt most by recent trends in the U.S. wage structure.

The fact that our data represent one trAining program and come from only two
companies has both benefits and limitations. The obvious disadvantage is that our results
are not necessarily applicable to other programs or to other companies; this must be kept in

mind when considering the results. Another limitation is that the program ended in
2

February, 1994. Thus, at this stage, we are unable to examine potential long-run effects of
the training courses. On the other hand, the workers are likely more homogenous than those

in national data sets and they face the same local labor market conditions. The estimates
also apply tp a standth-dized training program that is of current policy interest.
We find that participants in this training program were on average younger, had less

seniority, and were more likely to be non-white and female than non-participants. Further,

participants in both companies earned less per hour than comparable non-participants,
suggesting negative selection into the program. On the other hand, in the manufacturing
company, participants were more likely to have bid for posted jobs before the training started

than were seemingly comparable non-participants. Overall, we find small effects of the
program on individual outcomes. In the service company, we find no significant effect of the

program on wage changes of participants relative to non-participants. We present limited
evidence that participants were more likely to be nominated or win a performance award at

the service company following training. Average wage growth for trainees in the
manufacturing company is larger relative to non-trainees, and the effect is usually
statistically significant at the 5% or 10% level. Further, trainees are more likely to bid for

new jobs and to receive upgrades than comparable non-trainees. Much, if not all, of the
overall increase in wages and job bidding appears to be due to "occupational" courses that
provide skills that are valuable for specific jobs at this firm. Finally, the evidence suggests
that workers have lower rates of absenteeism during the weeks in which they have classes.

I.

Background
The training partnership between the companies we study and the community college

began when the companies sought help from the college for on-site training for lower skilled
3

workers. The companies believed that their lower skilled workers needed training if the
companies were to remain competitive, and yet they did not have the in-house capability to

provide such training. The program was designed by adult education specialists at the
community college and subsidized by an 18 month grant from the federal government for
$450,000. The grant is part of the federal government's attempt to improve the workplace
literacy of currently employed low-skilled workers. The trRining ran from October/November

1992 through February 1994, and consisted of courses provided on-site by teachers, hired
specifically for the program, who specialize in adult education. Classes were held on-site and

typically met twice per week for two hours and were taught in five 8-12 week sessions.
Employees were paid their regular wages during class time.
Workers voluntarily signed-up for the classes, although they could only participate if

their absence would not disrupt the flow of work, as classes met during the regular shifts.
In our survey of the service employees, we inquired why they chose to take classes. Eighty

percent of those who took at least one class cited a desire to improve or update their skills

in general as one of the reasons for taking classes, 15% needed to know more about a
particular subject, and 10% sought to learn enough to help their children or grandchildren
at home. Only 10% of those taking classes circled "My supervisor made me do it" as one of

the reasois. Among those who did not take any classes, just over 40% of those who were
employed at the company last year claimed a lack of interest in the classes and only 12%

claim to have been unable to "get off of the floor" as reasons for not participating. These

results suggest that individuals taking the classes were more motivated than their nonparticipating co-workers.
A combined total of 480 workers attended the trpining classes. Eighty percent of the
trainees enrolled in 1-3 classes for a total of 5800 hours of potential class time in the service
4

company and 8400 hours of class time in the manufacturing. Workers in the two comparnes
(combined) attended a total of over 12,500 actual class hours. The companies paid no direct

costs (as the teachers' salaries, course materials, etc. were covered by the federal grant),
however the indirect costs were large. In release time alone, the foregone cost of production

amounted to almost $150,000. The program director estimates the total indirect cost (which
also includes the value of fringe benefits, 15% of the wages for 18 months for the employees

of the companies who oversaw the training, and the rental cost of the room) to be about
$300,000. Thus, the program cost approximately $940 per student, or $36 per student class

hour, and is about equivalent to the cost per trainee for programs sponsored by the Job
Partnership Training Act (Bloom, et. al. (1993)). The total direct and indirect cost of the
training program was about 4 percent of the average employee's compensation.
The content of the training was largely basic skills education that was, in part, custom

tailored to these specific companies. Subjects ranged from reading, writing, math, and
English as a Second Language, to more occupational courses such as blueprint math and

blueprint reading.

The program also included 'mini" classes in subjects such as

communication, stress reduction, and time management. Because the classes primarily
taught general skills that would enhance productivity at other companies, a basic human
capital model would predict that the employees bear the full cost of the classes. In principle,

employers would have little or no incentive to pay for the training since employees could
leave the company and receive the same pay for their new skills. On the one hand, since the

employees in this program essentially bore none of the direct cost of the training (class
attendance was on "company time") we might expect an increase in worker turnover, if their

wages did not change. On the other hand, the directors of human resources, although aware
of the possibility, were not overly concerned about inducing more turnover. In particular, the

5

director at the manufacturing company noted that while skills such as blueprint reading
were, in principle, valuable at other firms, the decline in manufacturingin the area reduced

the portability of the skills, rendering the training more specific' in nature.

In general, it does not appear that training participants had higher turnover in the

months since the training began. In fact, at the manufacturing company 21% of those
workers who were present just before the training started had left 18 months later; the
comparable percentage is 18% among trainees. At the service company, only 10% of those

workers who were present just before the training started had left 18 months later, and the

turnover rate is roughly similar among both trainees and non-trainees. In the short run,

based on these statistics, the training does not appear to have caused disproportionate
turnover among the participants.t

II. Data
The Manufacturing ComDany
Employment at the manufacturing company is highly cyclical, fluctuating between 500

and 700 production workers. All production workers were targeted for training. From job

applications, we collected information on age, education, race, date of hire, and marital
status. In addition, we recorded all jobs each employee had held while employed at the
company. We have detailed information through November, 1993 and the company provided

us with an update on the jobs held by employees as of February 1, 1994. Because the classes

were held over five sessions and our data come from different sources, we illustrate the
In the manufacturing company, 70% of those who left did so because of "personal
illness". Only about 3% left due to "another job", "moved to another area", or were 'absent
for more than two weeks. Neither of these categories contain disproportionate shares of
training participants. On the other hand, approximately 20% were laid-off or discharged (27
workers) of which only 3 had participated in training.

timing of various outcome measures in relation to the training program in Figure la.

Our first outcome measure is hourly wages. We recorded previous wage and job

profiles within the company from the personnel files. The classes at the manufacturing
company started in early November, 1992 and ended in February, 1994. Thus, we collected
information on the wage in effect as of October, 1992 as a measure of the pre-training wage.

Note that since the company is unionized, wage rates are attached to jobs. In some
specifications we also include the wage in effect in July, 1991 to capture differential wage

growth over the wage distribution. As stipulated by the union contract, job openings are
posted and workers bid for them. The most senior qualified worker receives the job upgrade.
Thus, another outcome we consider is the number ofjobs for which an employee bids as well
as the number ofjob upgrades received. Workers who receive training may bid for more jobs

either due to increased skills that allow them to qualifr for higher skilled jobs or because
they perceive they are more qualified. Either way, the company gains by having a larger pool

of applicants from which to choose. We collected both the total number of job bids and
upgrades received from January 1992 through October 1992, as well as the number of job

bids and upgrades received from November 1992 through October 1993. We have the
problem that the classes were still being held as of the dates of these outcome measures;
however, all of the employees who were enrolled in classes in the fifth session had also taken

classes in previous sessions.
Finally, representatives of the manufacturing company complained frequently about
worker absenteeism and tardiness. Further, the community college organizers hypothesized
that workers were more likely to come to work when they had class, which if true, would be

a substantial benefit for this company. In order to test this hypothesis, we measured job
absenteeism as the number of hours that an' employee was absent from work, and for which

he was not paid, each week.' Unpaid time also includes tardiness. For the manufacturing
company, we have information on job absenteeism from the end of February, 1993 through

the end of February, 1994.
We started with a 8ample of 729 production workers from the manufacturing company.

In creating our analysis sample, however, we excluded 168 individuals who were not
employed by the company on Feb. 1, 1994. In addition, we excluded 78 employees who were

hired after October 31, 1992 (29 of whom left before February, 1994). Finally, we excluded

nine apprentices. The apprenticeship program lasts 4 years and during that time, the
apprentices are not paid according to the union wage schedule. Thus, our wage results are
somewhat sensitive to which wage we assign them because the apprentices receive a large

wage increase upon completion of the program. Given that the apprenticeship is another

form of training and that participation in the community college program is unlikely to
change the short-term trajectory of their wages, we chose to exclude them.3 Our final sample

from the manufacturing company includes 503 workers.

The Service Company
The service company employs approximately 300 workers, of which 250 were targeted

for training. We collected information on each workers age, gender, race, education, marital

status and date of hire from their job application forms. See Figure lb for a time line of the
class sessions and our data. Following the analysis of the manufacturing company data, we

collected information on the wage in effect as of November 1992 as a measure of the pre2There were 56 cases of more than 40 hours recorded as being unpaid for the week.. This
was likely due to clerical timing and we dropped these observations. Their exclusion had
little effect on the results.

training wage. In some specifications, we also include a wage measure from September,
1991. The company has provided us with the hourly wage in effect in mid-January, 1994 as

a measure of post-training wages. Although our post-training wage is not after the training

program had completely ended, it does capture wages after participation for most. Ninetyfive percent of those workers who took at least one class took their first class during the first

four sessions, that is before November, 1993.
A second outcome we examine is the number of performance nominations and awards.
The company has a monthly employee recognition program in which supervisors, co-workers,

or customers nominate workers who have performed exceptionally well. There are individual
as well as group level awards. The program has been in effect for several years and the exact
details change periodically. Nevertheless, for the period in which we collect data, each month

approximately 20-30 individuals (including entire work groups) are nominated for these

prizes, and about 5 winners are selected by a rotating committee. All nominees attend a
luncheon and winners of individual awards receive $25, $50, or $75 to be determined by the
committee. We collected the number of nominations and awards, both group and individual,
that employees received from January, 1992 through November, 1992. We also recorded the

number of nominations and awards for the period December, 1992 through February, 1994.
We treat nominations and awards as a reflection of worker productivity or motivation

since those nominating an individual are asked to consider factors such as "extra effort,"
"team work," "quick action/short notice," "super quality effort," "problem solving," and "service

excellence." Nominations require an explanation as to why the employee deserves the award,

allowing us to observe the stated reasons for noiiiination. As a typical example, one group

nomination reads,
Their special team-minded dedication and sacrifice over the past
several months. During this tithe period, each of them gave up

9

pert of their weekends in order to complete [customer] printing
backlogs. Around-the-clock weekend printing has consecutively
been scheduled for almost every month. Some operators have
worked as much as 20+ hours.
An individual nomination describes,
Volunteering to come in on a Saturday to work overtime printing

thousands of (customer] letters. In the middle of the printing,
he noticed that there would not be enough stock to complete the
run. He called [his manager] at home to see what could be done.
He then went out of his way to look up on line the stock location

(a task that he was not familiar with) and then made several
trips to the 4th floor to bring down enough letterhead to finish
the job. These tasks are not a requirement of his job, but he
recognized the urgency in order to meet the customer deadline.
While it is possible that employees were nominated for the mere fact that they had attended

the training program, rather than for any real productivity improvements, the recorded
reasons for nominating employees suggest otherwise. The correlation between total number

of performance award nominations and wages in 1994 is 0.35, indicating that the award
nominations are correlated with productivity.
Finally, we also measure the effect of the classes on worker absenteeism. Due to the

form in which we could collect our data, this final outcome is measured differently in the
service company than in the manufacturing company. In the sex-vice company, we calculated

the fraction of the 'regular" work week that the individual did not work. Thus, if there was

one holiday day in a particular week, we counted the regular week as four days. If an
individual took paid vacation, or had an absence due to an obligation such as jury duty, we
also adjusted the 'regulaf week accordingly. The resulting variable ranges from zero to one,

and we have information from January, 1992 through October, 1994.
Our final sample from the service company consists of 220 individuals. We eliminated

38 employees who started working at the company after November, 1992, 31 workers not

targeted for the program (this eliminates 15 union workers plus another 16 sales
10

representatives and upper management employees), and 38 employees who left the company

before mid-January, 1994.

A Comparison with the Current Population Survey

Table 1 compares our samples with national samples from the annual merge file of

the outgoing rotation groups of the Current Population Survey (CPS) for 1991. The CPS

samples in columns (2) and (4) are from the same industry and exclude managerial,
professional, technical and sales occupations to be comparable to our company samples. In

our service company, the workers are slightly older and better paid, and there is a greater
proportion female and Black than in the CPS sample, probably because the companies are

located in New Jersey. On the other hand, the educational distributions are fairly similar.
There is a smaller fraction of female employees and a larger proportion minority (Black and

Hispanic) in the manufacturing company; the workers in our manufacturing company have
slightly less education but are slightly better paid than the CPS sample. The smaller fraction

ever-married in both companies is probably due to the fact that our information on this
variable is not current since it is based on application forms. While our two companies
cannot be representative of their industries because they are based in New Jersey, they are
not obvious outliers either.

Company Surveys

To supplement our personnel and administrative data, we also conducted a survey of
the employees in each company. (See Appendix A for a copy of the survey instrument.) The

survey was conducted by asking employees to complete the questionnaire at work. At the

manufacturing company the survey was conducted during the last 10-15 minutes of the

management's bi-monthly information meeting," whereas representatives of the service
company scheduled production workers to complete the survey at specified times. The survey

was conducted from mid-March through early April, 1994. The response rate among those
in attendance was very high, approximately 95%.
The questionnaire elicited information on employees' attitudes towards their job, job

performance relative to last year, interest in reading, educational aspirations for their
children, as well as specific questions about why they did or did not participate in the
training class. Further, we also asked workers for their martial status and education as our
measures were from job applications and potentially out-of-date.

Measuring Participation

Our primary measure of participation in training is a dummy variable indicating

whether an individual took at least one class in any of the five sessions. For the
manufacturing company we also measure training as having taken at least one occupational

class since these classes provided skills that would allow workers to become eligible for
certain jobs within the company. We have experimented with other measures of participation

such as the actual number of hours of class attended and a measure that weights
participation by the months since the class (to reflect the fact that some individuals
completed their classes in an early session while others were still enrolled in February, 1 994).

The results are fairly robust to alternative specifications.

For our analysis of subjective outcomes using the survey data from the service
company, we use self-reported measures of training participation in order to maximize our

sample size. To gauge the extent to which individuals correctly identified their training
status in the survey data, we compared the self-reports of training to administrative records

12

for the subset of the survey participants we could match with our survey sample. The results

are reported below:

Eighty-six percent of the manufacturing company employees correctly reported their
training status, and 93 percent of service company employees correctly reported their training

status. Interestingly, in both cases the more common error was for nontrainees to report
having taken training. At the manufacturing company, 20% of nontrainees reported they
took the training course, whereas the corresponding error rate for the service company is
13

13%. About 20% of the manufacturing employees and 10% of the service employees who
responded that they took training in our survey did not take the training course according
to the administrative records. The high error rate leads one to be concerned about the impact

of measurement error in studies of the effectiveness of on-the-job training that are based
solely on worker self-reports of training.

Ill. Who Participates in TrilnIng?
Tables 2a and 2b present the means and standard deviations of key variables for
employees of the manufacturing and service companies, disaggregated by whether or not they

participated in the training program. We measure trnining status by the administrative
records here. Because the occupational courses seem to be particularly germane at the
manufacturing company, we present estimates for workers who took at least one occupational

training class as well. In both companies, the trainees tend to be younger, more likely to be

male, more likely to be nonwhite, and better educated than the non-trainees. Given these
characteristics, it is not surprising that the pre-training average hourly wage of the trainees

is lower than that of the non-trainees.
In Table 3 we present probit estimates of participation equations for each company.

The dependent variable equals 1 if the employee participated in training, and 0 otherwise.
Derivatives of the probabilities at the mean values of the variables are reported along with

the probit coefficients. Again, for the manufacturing company we treat fl training courses
and occupational training course separately.

First consider results for the manufacturing company. There is a statistically
insignificant relationship between the incidence of training and tenure (p-value equals 0.27).

Years of education have a positive and statistically significant effect on the incidence of

training. There is not a statistically significant effect of the shift on training in the
manufacturing company, probably because training courses were offered during all day shifts

at this company. Workers who bid for job openings in the previous year were more likely to

undergo traiiiing. Lastly, we find a negative relationship between the wage rate and the
probability of training.

In several important respects, selection into training is different at the service
company. Age, gender, race, and education are statistically insignificant determinants of
training. The probability of undergoing training tends to fall slightly during the first four
years ofjob tenure, and then rise thereafter (p-value equals 0.13). Higher paid workers are

less likely to attend training. Workers on the first shift are significantly more likely to
attend training, probably because courses were only offered during the first shift. Workers

who are part of larger departments are more likely to have attended training, perhaps
because it was easier for someone else to cover for them while they were off the floor. These

findings point to negative selection into training, with the least skilled workers more likely

to select training.

W. The Effects of Training
A. Wage Effects

We estimate a variety of models to determine the impact on wages of participating in

job training. Because we were particularly concerned about self-selection into training, the
basic specification we estimate is:

(1) Jn W = a +

+

+L

15

where Edn W is the change in the log hourly wage between 1992 and 1994, X is a row vector

of covariates (including age, tenure, gender, etc.), and

is a dummy variable that equals 1

if the worker participated in the training program between 1992 and 1994, and 0 if not. The

coefficient y measures the proportionate growth in wages associated with training. By
modelling wage growth, we hope to net out any omitted fixed worker effects. Because wage

growth is sensitive to tenure, we include a flexible functional form of tenure.' We assume
is an error term that is uncorrelated with T1. In some specifications, we also include as

an explanatory variable the log wage in 1991, to allow for differential wage growth across the

wage distribution.

Results of OLS growth equations are reported in Table 4a for the manufacturing
company and 4b for the service company. (Standard cross-sectional semi-log wage regressions

for the samples are reported in the Appendix Table 1.) Because of the smaller sample size

and higher residual variance, the estimated training effects are much less precise for the

service company than for the manufacturing company. When no other covariates are
included, the wage growth equations indicate a positive association between training and

wage growth in both companies. Including age and tenure greatly attenuates the training
effect for the service company. If we include a quadratic in age and tenure, demographic
variables, and job characteristic variables (column (3)), wage growth is insignificantly related

to the variable that measures whether the worker took any training at either company.

When we include the 1991 log wage as an explanatory variable in column (4), the

coefficient on the training variable is even smaller for the manufacturing company and

negative with a t-ratio close to 2 for the service company. One problem with this
' Our resujth were qualitatively similar if we included a quartic in tenure, and dummy

variables indicating different ranges of tenure.

Notes: Standard errors arà in parentheses Regressions also a dummy variable indicating whether
education is rnia5ing.

specification, however, is that we must drop 10 percent of our sample at the service company

because workers must be employed for three continuous years to have wages each period;

thus, low tenure workers are dropped from the sample. If we restrict the sample to lowtenure workers (tenure under 5 years) and estimate the specification in column (3) for the
service company, the training coefficient is 0.015 with a standard error of 0.014. Eliminating
low-tenure workers changes the composition of the sample, and may have an important effect

on the estimated return to training.
If we focus solely on occupational classes (columns 5-8 of Table 4a), the training

variable has a more robust, positive association with wage growth at the manufacturing

company. For example, taking an occupational education class is estimated to increase
earnings growth by 0.6 percent when no covariates are included, and by 0.4 percent when
age, tenure, demographic variables, and the pre-training wage are held constant (column 8).

The findings for the occupational education classes are consistent with the importance that

company officials attached to specific occupational skills, such as the ability to read a
blueprint. In some jobs in this company, proficiency in reading blueprints is a requirement
for promotion.

B. Effects on Job Bids and Uorades
At the manufacturing company, 23% of the employees in our sample bid for jobs in

1993. Just under 30% percent of those who applied received at least one upgrade.5 In
Tables 5a and 5b we analyze the extent to whiqh the training classes may have affected the
likelihood that an employee bid for a job or received a job upgrade in 1993 using an ordered

These percentages are roughly the same for the full sample before our exclusions.

probit model. This model assumes a latent-variable structure of the form:

(2) y*X+E.
We observe (assuming three categories),

y=O ifE<X,

y=1 ifX3<€<Xt3+,

y=2 ifX+X<c,
where bO, and,
P0 = F(X)
P1 = F(X + X) - F(X)
P2 =

1-F(X+ A.).

The model easily generalizes to more than three categories.
Because union rules stipulate that the employer must choose the most senior employee

among those qualified when filling a job posting, we were careful to control for tenure (or

seniority). In the results shown here, we include a quartic in tenure, however, the results

are robust to several alternative specifications. As usual, we define participation in two
ways: having taken any of the trpining classes and having taken any of the occupational
classes.
In the columns (1) and (5) of Table 5a we find that training participants bid for more

jobs than non-participants whether they took any class or took any occupational class. The

difference is statistically significant at the 5% level. Because the coefficients from the
ordered probit are not easily interpreted, another way to gauge the difference is that those
who took any class had a 10 percentage point increase in their likelihood of bidding for at
6

have also modeled the data using OLS, a binary probit as to whether an individual
ever bid or ever received an upgrade, and a Poisson model for count data. The results are
invariant to the choice among these models.

least one job than non-participants; those who took at least one occupational class were 21

points more likely to bid than non-participants and those who never took an occupational
class.7 In columns (2) and (6) we add controls for the number of job bids and job upgrades
in 1992. The coefficient on the number of previous job upgrades is negative and insignificant.
but the coefficients on the number of previous job bids is positive and statistically significant.

Adding previous bids and job changes, as well as personal characteristics such as
demographic variables, tenure, age, education, and log wage in 1992, increases the
participation coefficients slightly. Finally, we also include the log wage that individuals
employed at the company in 1991 earned as of July 1991. Although not shown, the coefficient

is typically negative and insignificant. Further, it has little effect on the participation
coefficients.

The results of the effect of the training classes on the number of job upgrades are
presented in Table 5b which has an identical structure to Table 5a. Again, the coefficients

in columns (1) and (5) indicate that trpining participants were significantly more likely to
receive job changes. Those who took at least one class are 7 points more likely than nonparticipants and those who took at least one occupational course are 8.5 points more likely

than those who nevar took an occupational class to receive a job change. As in Table 5a,
those taking classes continue to be more likely to receive job upgrades than non-participants

conditional on personal characteristics and on the wage received in 1991. Overall, the
evidence suggests that the training program encourages employees to bid for more jobs and

improves their likelihood of receiving job changes, assuming there are no additional selfselection effects for which we have not controlled.

The probability difference is based upon a binary probit and the derivative of the
probability is evaluated at the mean of the independent variable.

C. Effects on Performance Awards
The results of the effect of the trpining program on performance awards in the service

company are presented in Table 6. The estimates are from OLS regressions. Because a
maximum of five individual nominations, four group nominations, and two awards of each

type were received, we also estimated the models using ordered probits, as well as binary
probits (on whether ever nominated or ever awarded) with similar results. The first column

in each block presents the raw difference in the number of nominations or wins between

participants and non-participants, the second column controls for past awards or
nominations, and the final column also includes personal characteristics.

In looking at individual nominations, before conditioning on other variables,
participants received 0.24 more nominations than did non-participants with a p-value equal
to 0.076. Forty-nine percent of participants were nominated for at least one individual award

in 1993. as compared to 36% of non-participants. In column (2), the coefficient on number

of individual nominations received in 1992 is positive and significant at the 10% level
suggesting that those who have received nominations in the past are more likely to receive

them in the future. However, the coefficient on the number of individual nominations
received in 1993 remains virtually unchanged, reflecting that the number of nominations
received in 1992 is only weakly correlated with participant status (as also found in Table 3).

With the addition of personal characteristics such as demographic information, years of
education, and tenure, the coefficient decreases in size and becomes statistically insignificant

at any typical significance level.
The effects of the classes on the number of individual awards, group nominations, and

group awards were smaller in magnitude and statistically insignificant. In three of the four
cases, controlling for past nominations or awards alone did not change the coefficient on the

Thus, while there is some evidence that training participants were more likely to be
nominated for performance awards, the difference appears to be largely explained by other

personal characteristics.

D. Effects on Absenteeism

To estimate the impact of participating in job training on worker absenteeism, we
created a panel of weekly data on each employee's number (or fraction) of unpaid hours of

work and the number of class hours the employee was scheduled to attend that week. We
estimate the following basic specification using both random and fixed-effects models:

(3) ha+C+Xy+€1+u
where b is the number (or fraction) of non-paid hours each week, and C1 is the number of
class hours for worker i in week t; X1 is a vector of time-invariant individual characteristics.

In the random effects model, c is modeled as an individual-specific component of the error

term with variance a, and u a serially uncorrelated transitory component with variance c.
The model is estimated by OLS on the quasi-differenced variables and some specifications
also include individual covariates such as age, tenure, and education, as well as time effects.
We also estimate a fixed effects model in which r is treated as an individual fixed effect, and

again we include time effects in some specifications.

In all cases, we exclude the week

including Christmas from our sample since absenteeism was high and there were no classes

that week.

Results of the absenteeism equations are presented in Tables 7a and Th. In both

companies, there is a negative impact of classes on absenteeism and the results are similar
using both random and fixed effects estimators. In the manufacturing company, before time

effects are included, the number of class hours each week has a statistically significant
negative effect on the number of unpaid hours missed that week. That is, those who were
supposed to attend class appear more inclined to be at work that week. The effect is small,

however. Each hour of class time reduces unpaid absenteeism by 0.08 hours. Given that
workers in this company are paid $12.00 per hour, on average, this effect translates into 96

cents of 'recovered value from production time for each hour of class each week, or about

$8000 for all workers over the duration of the program. Once time effects are added, the

magnitude of the effect decreases by over 25 percent, and the coefficient is no longer
statistically significant at conventional significance levels. Results in the service company

are roughly similar. An additional class hour per week decreases the fraction of regular
hours of work missed per week by 0.4 percent. Given an average work week of 37.5 hours

this translates into 0.15 hours. The fact that the estimated coefficients fall in magnitude
when week effects are added indicates that the courses were less likely to be scheduled
during holidays or other times when absenteeism was high.

On the whole, this evidence suggests that the trAining program had some effect on
absenteeism, although it is not conclusive. Even if our estimated coefficients are correct, the

effect is small. At most, the reduction in absenteeism accounts for less than 10% of the cost

of the program per worker. On the other hand, we have not considered the possible longer-

run effect of the training program on absenteeism and tardiness, an effect that can only be
determined in a longer follow-up.

22

E. Subjective Evaluations
Our survey enables us to investigate the effect of participating in job training on the

answers to a variety of subjective questions. For examples, we asked workers about their

satisfaction'with their company, desire to take additional training classes, educational
aspirations for their children and grandchildren, and job performance. We tabulated the

mean responses to these questions for training participants and non-participants. In
addition, we adjusted the differences between the participants and non-participants by
estimating a regression of the response to subjective questions on an intercept, years of
education, tenure, and gender and marital status dummies. These results are presented in
Table 8a for the manufacturing company and Table 8b for the service company.
For almost all of the subjective variables that we examined, there is not a statistically

significant difference between the trainees and non-trainees. For example, 84 percent of
training participants and 80 percent of non-participants reported that they like working at
their company a lot or somewhat, with a t-ratio of 1.0 on the difference. (The corresponding

figures are 92 and 90 percent at the service company.) Although trainees are less likely to

apply for jobs in other companies, more likely to belong to religious and community
organizations, have higher educational aspirations for their children or grandchildren, and

are more likely to read books or magazines than non-trainees, the differences between
trainees and non-trainees on these variables are all statistically insignificant and fairly small.

We find, however, that at both companies trainees are significantly more likely than

non-trainees to report that they plan to take additional classes in the near future. This
finding would be unexpected if trainees considered their training worthless. Perhaps more

significantly, at the service company the average improvement in self-reported job
performance is higher among trainees than among non-trainees. For example, trainees are

31 percentage points more likely to report that their supervisor would say they are doing a

better job currently than a year ago (before training). Whether these results signify that
trainees' actual job performance has improved, or are just a reflection of improved self-esteem

from trainin is an open question.

V. Conclusion
We conclude by crudely comparing the likely benefits and costs of the training
program. Earlier we noted that the total cost of training (direct expenses and release time)

for these programs was approximately 4 percent of the average trainee's annual
compensation. How large is the return on training that is required to justify this investment?
If we assume that completed job tenure is 20 years (twice average incomplete tenure spells),

and use a 3 percent real discount rate, then the training program would need to generate a
0.275 percent annual return to cover its costs in present value.

How do our estimated benefits compare to the required rate of return? The most
direct monetary estimates we have of the return to the training is the wage growth associated

with participating in training. For the manufacturing company these estimates are between
0.4 and 0.6 percent for occupational classes, whereas for the service company the estimates
are typically insignificantly different from zero (as well as from 0.275 percent). On the other

hand, it is possible that the social return to the training is higher than the measured private

wage growth because workers may not capture all (or even most) of the proceeds of their

increased productivity from job training. There are several additional caveats that are
necessary to qualify this favorable interpretation. Perhaps most importantly, one could easily

question whether the higher wage growth we document for trainees at the manufacturing
company is ca.isally linked to the training program. In addition, we do not know whether
24

the short term 0.4-0.6 percent wage growth associated with occupational training is an effect

that lasts 20 years. And although we plan to follow-up the long-term effects of the training

program, we have no way of following workers who leave the companies. This may be a
significant limitation because Topel and Ward (1992) document that significant wage gains

are associated with mobility.

If the payoff from training dissipates before 20 years, or if the estimated effect is

biased upward, the benefits of job training would be smaller than we estimated.
Nevertheless, we interpret our results as suggesting that the measured return to investment

is probably in the same ballpark as the required rate of return. Naturally, more analysis
would be useful to determine if the training were cost effective.
