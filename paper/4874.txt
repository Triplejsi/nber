WOMEN'S CHOICES OF COLLEGE
MAJORS AND FACULTY GENDER
COMPOSITION

ABSTRACT
It is frequently asserted that a college's female undergraduate enrollment in the sciences
and engineering can be increased by raising female representation on the faculties in these areas.
Despite the widespread acceptance of this proposition, it does not appear to have been subjected
to any kind of serious statistical analysis. In this paper, we assemble panel data from three rather

different educational institutions, and use them to examine the relationship between the gender
composition of the students in an academic department and the gender composition of its faculty

at the time the students were choosing their majors. We fmd no evidence for the conventional

view that an increase in the share of females on a department's faculty leads to an increase in
its share of female majors.

1. IflUCtiQfl
In recent years, considerable conrn has n expressat over the

dearth of female scientists aid ergineers in the thital States. This
corxrn has foaisel attention at the fact that female ctllee
urdergraduates are riuth less likely to major in scierte, mathematics, aid
ergineerin than their male cainterparts. Cne
belief is that

izceasin the number of female faailty in these fields waild itease the
number of females majorirg in ttn. This belief aears to have
influer pablic licy. For example, the National Scierre }bntatiat
has instithtat a "Visiting Prof essorshipe for Wnn" program that provides

grants to enable

scientists aid engineers to serve as visitirq

professors at U.S. a.wkt,i,i c institutin. Cne objective of the program is

"To ernirage female sti-nts to pwaie carrs in sciei aid erqimerin
by providing greater visibility for n scientists aid ergineers in
irdustry, governuent, aid arcvio.nl c lxstithticms."

This rction has also taken hold in a pntr of eiirational

thstitutions. For example, a recent rrt at Priztat University
entitl& A Prram for the uittext aid Iteritiat of Waie'i Faalltv in
Sciente aid Enineerizxr assertal that Priitai 's "ability to atlnct aid
retain nn stsients" bnild be "profazdly at fectel" by an ixease In
the number of female facility in scie aid englneerlsq (Girgus [1992,

p.5]). Erbinith C3Uee has establisl a 1' in Scierce Project .those
pne is to ixcrease the percentage of n parath science majors Eq
hiring more wan faailty iii the sciezres. Similarly, the Provost of Yale

1

university recently inlicatei that, in order to attract rrre sn to math
aid sciei, universities stnild think ait dazqlzq their hiring
practices in ways that .nild lead to inaeases in the ru.nber of fanale

faculty iTantsrs (New York Tiis, Janiary 24, 1993, p. 23).
Given the arwlamli C

caninity 's widespread aatarce of this view,

we were surprisal s.ten we were unable to f lid any seriass expirical
su4çort whatsoever for the assertJ.at that the geixer caxçcsition of an

acadanic departnent affts the gerder rtup'iaiticn of its majors. The

pirpcee of this paper is to investigate this hypothesis eaeicaily.
Tb do so, we obtainal fran three different acadanic irstitutiats data that

track the n.uthers of fanale faculty aid sb.ents aas dart1Ents aid
over tim. In general, we f lid r evidet for the wzvent3aial vis that
an ircrease in the share of fanales at a dqartnent 's fanilty leads to an

irease in its

share of fenale urdergraduate majors. Hea, university
adrnj.n.jstrators t seek to inxease fenale enro.Umnts In particular

dqartherits by idxinj an lrease in fate faculty may f lid their
efforts to he of r avail.

The rxitiai that an uniergraitiate tan 's dtoioe of major is affectel
by the faculty's geriler czrpcsition açears to be hazel at the cq't of
a role ncdel, defined as art irdividual t has "skills or qualities that
(amther] lacks aid yet admires aid wishes to n'1 pte" (Aidersai aid

Arother arginuent for the need for female role zels relates to the

traditional role of waten in rican society. Acxztng to this view,
the dIaracter attribates rsssary for professional adtieveznent are

iniipatible with traditional feminine qualities, so that a yairq 'aan
with serials career antitions needs female role nnieis to deitnstrate that

siss is possible. Thus, Tilghman (1993) argues that "all bit the t
determined waren will tend to gravitate to the enviraijnent tdi is ntst
pcitive aid rewariixq, aid that tends to be whe.re other n have
already let the way." Acwnlirq to kbx (1974, p.19], "The deviations frau

rcnative female marital aid familial patterns that are typi1 of nzen
Ht. D. s may loan as
e significant where female facilty is snail."
Similarly, t.afortune (1990, p.273] asserts that, "thly an increase in the
nimber of walQn in scientific careers, and/or the teactini of math ant

scier at advai levels, will tharqe the inasaiiJ.ne social Image
associatat with these fields, and ezirage re girls to enter then."2

?tat evidera is there for the iuportan of role nis? )tst of

it

frr wveys that asic yaarq n irthat factors determine the

careers for whith tMy are preparirq. Ptr exauple, Basai aid Ha#e (1980,

p.571) surveyed a grnip of oc1lee stixients, aid at the basis of the
respxises caludet that "feale rindeis are partidflarly inçortant for

female ollee students In their career decisions, especially nothers ant
female teathers." Similarly, after lnterviwirq a graip of oc11ee-tnird
female high-sthool seniors, )tlaze aid PiSil (1978, p.181) nclt that

"one of the major barriers" to wuien's na Jj sciee is that girls
"perceive that priaration for science careers is too diffiailt tw-ttca
they lack awareness of n-'essful an scientists." th the basis of the
3

btLure-Piehl survey, Betz aM Fitzgerald (1987,

çp.70—71] argue

that

"there is eviderce that the relative lack of fale faculty is a deterrent
to cen 's educational an (sic) carr pa-suits, nartiaflarly In scierce."
I-Icwever, the fact that irdividuals in a survey assert that sa factor is
the cause of their behavior does riot nean that it rscsc-c'rily is. In any
to the cççcsite crc1usion. Hackett, Esposito
case, other surveys
aM O'Halloran (1989, p.l77] surveyed a grcup of collje taien aid

r1ude1 that "perceived role nl influeis. . . are itt prcinising
explanatory variables for nontraditional aid sciei—reiata1 colle—major
choices."

A rrcre seriais attapt to establish a link between fnale faculty
role ucdels aid faaale stixient enrolimnt was made by Fox (1974] - For

several universities, he cxrpited the ixirrelaticn between the zuaber of

n faculty aid ninber of an undergraduates in major icic
divisions) Re faini a positive rreiaticz-t, aid Interpreted this as
support for the notion that saite-gerxier role xrieis at ft undergraduate

doice of major. Haiever, Fox's finding really tells us nothing aat
whether ircreas Jig the fenale faculty reprentaticn in a departnent b.nhld

i.rcrease fenale urdergraduate enroliiint. lb eamine the validity of suth
a claim, at waild have to analyze the relation across tbie between the

gender cxrpceiticn of faculty and the gender tçraition of stitits. In
ccatast, Fdx examines the relationship at a given çolnt in tijne. The

finding of a positive ccirrelatjcai i a as saticm mi4it be due siirply
to the fact that an gravitate to certain crnipaticris aid the assadated

c.rses of study kuse of ailthral influer: N (C)hildren may
internalize

traditional notic* of sex roles, aaqit these aaltzal sex
4

stereotypes as fact, and eventually cthoose cxripations that cxnform to
these stereotypes" (Qrcxiran aid Qairant [1985, p.275)).

While air foais is on the decisions of Q)llee st*ñents, there has
teen sate closely related work on the thoice of .rses by pre-collee
girls. Here as well fanale role rirdels have been assigned a key role.
Hoc.€ver, we have rot been able to find any mre axpellin evidence in the

high stthi than in the llege ccritext. aiiith aid &b [1986, p.673]

claim that "the use of ien sciez career 1s may positively affect
th enro1Thnt in science irses by girls enter irq high sdool aid their
personal o'nsideration of a science career." This c1usicn was &awn on
the basis of an experiment in bthLdl one graip of sbnts was exposed to
SQIE

.wen scientists over a period of tine aid a ntrvl graip was not.

The stents were surveyed bef ore aid after the test. In t± pre-test
stage, the graipe were similar in their resr1ses to qutions ait .nxen
in scier. In the post-test stage, the ecperiirental grnzp had a note

positive attitixie taiard tan in sciei. There was, Iraver, no
evidence on whether the girls in the experimental graip atseuently were

actually note likely to enroll in science xurses.4
In sunnary, the effects of same-gerder role e1s have been sti.xlied

in the yctiolcqical aid sio1ical literatures on adintion aid career

deve1xent.5 tie the verdict is rot unanimis, the general view is
that role noiels affect 1n' s dintionai aid career dioias. Haaver,
t of the evidence is basal either on case sttdies or surveys. We have
I aini ro attsrpts explicitly to relate d,arses in the number of fenale

role els to ctharqes in yalrg sxt' S participation In variais

3. Data
The data for this stixiy were collected frau three schools, Princeton

university, the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, aid Whittier 1lee.
One reason these thstitut ions were selected is sinply that they were

wi1lir to give us the inforrat ion we reuesta1—a ntr of other schools
we approached were unwilliz or unable to provide the rt-'ccary

thforration6 Their selection was also influemed by a desire to
obtain sate diversity with respect to type of institution, ard hei to
determine whether the role ncdel theory applies in sai settins aid wt
in others. Princeta, is a highly selective7 private research university
w!e unieryraduate errolient (akc*xt 4,500 st.dents) is relatively stan
for a research university. Michigan is a selective public research
university with a nich larer urdergraduate student kxxy, alxnt 22,000

stdents. Whittier is a stall (2,000 student), private, literal arts
collee that puts nuch less enpasis on research than Princeton aid
Michigan, aid ctiich has less sirqent admissions requirenents than those
institutions. While Michigan aid Whittier have n coeducational for
many years, Princeton began admittixq female uniergraduates aily ui 1969.

In 1986 alnit a third of Prurcetcgi's seniors were wazn, azt 40 percent
of Michigan's, aid ait half of Whittier's.
Ibe nethcds for collecturg the data differed anaxj the schools.
Both Princeton aid Whittier were unable to provide official dinents with

the n.miter of faailty by gerder, dwartrent, aid year. Hea, we
tabalatal the data by hard usixg past aiitia,s of the relevant
Urderqraduate anTnuients. When first flai were ardrcgyrcus, we

6

nsult&I with varicsis administrative officials to detennine gerde.r. The
Mith.igan faaalty data were cczzpilal for us by

the

sdi1 's adznlnista-atiai.

With respect to data on stuients, the Prizxeton aid Michigan

Raistrar 'S Offices provided us i1ations fran various piblic aid

internal rrds. The Prurceton data nsist of figures fran the

thra4i 1991. At Michigan, the artinuaas set of
sttdent data begins with the graduating class of 1979 aid exterds thrcuh
1992. The s&ittier stxient data were nore orplicatal to asseoble. For
the perioi 1980—88, the Reistrar 's Off ia tabilated the data. For years
prior to 1980, ic tabilated statistics were available, aid the Rsisar
provided us with lists of the wrc aid majors of the sthdents who
graduatirq class of 1973

received their derees each year fran 1954 thra4i 1979.8 Uhf orthnately,

in the mid-1970s, Whittier institited s i prugran that ezncragal
sta3ents to take iniependent anl interdisciplinary majors. These ctiarqes
made it inipcesinle to tipare neaninfully the numbers of majors in

various departmEnts in the pre aid pct—1S73 periods. We therefore foais

on the 1974-88 period, which has the greatest overlap with the Priitai
aid Michigan data.9

&nnary statistics for the Priitat, Michigan, aid Whittier data
are presental in Thbles la, lb aid lc, respectively. For each sdl, the
left-hard side of the table stows the imean over tue relevant sanple period

of the proportion of feinle faailty in each department, the standard

deviation aid the niinln.nn aid maxinnn values of the pratiai.'0 The
right-hard side of the table ethibits the sama infamaticn for graduating

stienth.

7

casual inspation of the tables sa)gests several otservati.ons.

First, female faailty are distrilxttai aas departhents nore or less
a1on the expected lines. At Prixteton, far example, the mean prcportion

of females in the thenistry departhent is only 0.009, while in Panai
Languages ax! Literathre it is 0.240. Sean], in many departnents there

aççears to be a substantial annmt of variation over rise in the

prrt ion of female faailty. In Mictigan 'S themical flqineerln
Departint, for instaa, the mean prcçcrtiai is 0.015, bit it ranges fran
0.0 to 0.12. This is iniçcrtant, taause sate intertaxoral variation in
the prccrt ion of female faa.ilty is needed if one is to identify the
impact of chanth that prcçation on the genier ctrçcsiticn of the

stents.
Finally, within institutions there aears to be a pcsitive
correlation between the prcporticn of female stents in a departhent ax!
the proportion of female faailty. To examine this iteruxerrn re
carefully, we usa] 1986 data to estimate for each inetitution a rsression
of the proportion of female majors in the graduatinj ciass on the

prqrt ion of female fau.alty. In each case, the efficient on the
prcçxrtion of female faailty was positive ax! eyreis1 its stardard error
by nnre than a factor of fair.11 These finUxqs ifixm the results in
the sociology literattae that female faailty aid urxlergraduates terd to
eni up in the same dcparthents. HaQever, as stressed above, this

correlation tells us rrthix-q akr.xt whetter urdergraduates' choices of

majors are influercel by the genier caiçcsitiat of the faoilty. We TflJ
turn to the specjficatjcn aid estimation of a mae apru1c late statistical

1el.

4. Statistical !4xlel aid Results
In this section we specify aid estimate air basic ne1. We then
estiirate several variations of the itniel to pcqac.c the rotusthess of the

results.

4.1 Statistical !'bel
Cnsider a amp of stñents t graduate fran a sd1 in year t.

we define "ct

as

the prcportion of the graduates in departnct i at a

given sd1 who are fenale. (Ptr the sake of siuplicity, we stçpress the
sdl subscripts.) Next we def ire PaCflX as the female prcçorticrk of
the faailty in departnent at the tine that st4ents who aaduatei in
year t were thoiiu their ma ion.u For air basic nrdel, FACFEN is
cnip.xtecl as the average of the prcçnrticns of female faailty that

graduatirq members erintersi dtrirg their first aid sx1 years.
For exanpie, to detentine FMFfl1 for deparbient i in 1989, we s'nild take
the average of the fetiale faamlty prcpartioris in 1986 aid 1987.14

For eath sdnl we assi.re that
(1)

where t is a tine treid, fj is a departhental fixed effect, ct

a

raidan error, aid the B's are parameters to he estimated.15 The fixed

effect refers to all urxthaniln attrlhites of a departient that might
affect the prcçiortia of the stx3ents who are female, si.flt as a4tznal
rane whidi irdj.cmte that rta±n fields are "masailine" or "feninine."
In practicE, acnznti.ng for the fixed effect anoints to lnltilJn a series
= 1. if the oheervaticn is for
of didx,tainms variables WiJ, where
departient i aid zero otherwise. The quadratic tine trerd takes into
9

aanmt any possible overall trerxls that might affect female
enrollments.'6 For example, durirg ar sample period the proportion of

female urdergraduates at Princeton gIw s±stantially. The presez of
the tiiie trent asswes that we do rtt falsely attritute to the genier

sition of the faailty any iineases in female enrollments that were
really due to the ircreas& representation of t'nien in the student Ixidy as

a .ttole. A final estimation isw.e arises tecause the variances of the
error tens nay vary systematically aaces departnents. Therefore, we
ccrp.xted robust (Muter) staMard errors for afl the rression

efficients.
4.2 Basic

sults

The paramEter estimates for evation (1) usinj the Prizton,
Michigan, arxi Whittier data sets are reprtal in Tables 2a, 2b, ant 2c,

respectively. Qnsider first the Prirretcz results. When interpretin
the aefficients of the departient variables, rcte that thglish is criitted
frau the reressicn, so the ceefficient on each departxent shads its
prcçort ion of female majors relative to &qlish, ceteris oar ibis. The

cfficients on the department variables are generally statistically
significant at a aie-ty-czie basis; irk1, an F—test easily rejects t±)1e
null hypothEsis that the coefficients on the major variables are jointly
zero.11 The tine treni is also significant at zventiaial significance
levels. Q main focis, hazever, is the coefficient on F?a'E1. The
point estimate, 0.054, is minite—it azjgests that raisizq the percentage
of female faailty in a department by 10 percentage points, cieteris

pariths, taxld increase the percentage of faiele untergraduates W aily

0.54 percentage points. In fact, given that the associated stardard error
10

is 0.106, one cannot reject the hypothesis that the efficient is zero.
Thus, the Prinoeton data do rot support the vie.q that the gerder

arit ion of a departhent affects the gerder orposition of its
urdergraduate majors.

The stories for Michigan (Table 2b) ard Whittier (Table 2c) are
essentially the saize. The coefficients on FACFD4jt are anal]. in wagnithie

aid statistically insignificant. As was true for Prixaton, the major
fjy effects are statistically significant.18 Unlike the Prixcetai
case, the tine trerds are rot statistically significant for Midilgan ard
Whittier. However, when we esti.mated the &juations withait the trerd, the

results were substantially uriai. That is, the coefficient at
reinairisi statistically insignificant, providisq to aiport for

'c

the rotion that the gerder calçxEiticn of a department's faailty affects
the gerder citpeition of its unienraduate majors.19
4•3

Alternative Specifications

ow inability to reject the hypothesis that role ncdel effects are
aksent mit be due to saie misspecificatiai in &auatiai (1). To assncc
the rotusdess of ar results, in this section we examine several
alternative specifications.

Ftucticcal norm. auation (1) assui that the prcportion of faale
unierraduates izcreases linearly with the prc.portion of female faailty,

oeteris par ibis. Another possibility is that the presei of —' female
faailty in a department destroys the preconception that only men can

sus1 in the field, ard a any faEa.le faculty are present, addizxj
adlitional waien has to effect on female urdergraduate eyroUjits. 'lb
eicamixe this possibility, we aeatth the dithotanis variable DFjt, IaIaZ
11

euals one if there were any fales in departuEnt i at the tise that
graduates of year t were thocisirq their majors ant zero otherwise.

FollJir the convention ussi in definirg ncFsç , this aitnints to
detenninirq whether there were any . in the deparbnent during the
sttxlent' s first or sarsl years. For each school we then estimated

SItJFjt8o+BlDFjt+Bt+63t2+fj+Ejt.

(2)

Parl A of Table 3 reports the estimated coefficients on DFjt

their stardard enu; the other coefficients are not reported in order to
conserve space. For rio sdiool can or rejwt the hypothesis that the
coefficient on DFt is zero.
Another exercise in the sama spirit is to determine whether the

prcçcrtion of female unlergraduate majors irneases when the nrrt ion of

female faailty evn'cdc sate oritical value. This is the rcticn that a
"critical mass" of fle faafl.ty in a departitent is needa:t to intuce
urdergraduate waten to enroll. To irwestigate this issue, we created the
variable DFl5%j, which equals ore if the prcçicirtion of female faailty in
department i exceeded 15 percent In the relevant year, aid zero otherwise.

We then repla DFjt in equation (2) with DF15*jt, aid re-estimated the

equation. The results are reported in Panel A of Table 3. The

coefficients for Prirretat aid Itittier arztiriue to tie statistically
Insignificant. The coefficient for Mictigan is statistically significant,
but its sign suggests that when a critical mass of female faai].ty is
readied, the prcpirtion of fetale majors decreases.20 We are not

ilrlixied to make nfl of this result—The coefficient is ts1I jn

magnitz.xe, ant if ore rw en-naj ressiae, sooner or later a
12

significant efficient is Innt to exsrge. Still, this flxdin certainly
does rKit provide any suççxrt for the cawentional view.

The ucidels reportal in Pazl A etoiy a very extreme assumption on
hoa adjit ions to the number of female faailty might affect female

enrollnents—after sate

number

of female faailty members is readied, the

incenental impact of any others is zero. A less extrexe type of

diminishiN marginal rethrns can be nlla1 by inluin a quadratic in

(3)

The efficients on the lirear ant quadratic tens are reported in
Panel B of Table 3; again, the other aefficients are ai.pasd. For
each school the linear aid quadratic tens are inlivi dn1 ly aid jointly
insignificant.21 Heirs, alladnj for non1.inear effects does ret ctharqe

the basic result.
Iartent size. Male aid female urdergraduates nay differ in their
tastes with respect to dqartment size. While it is bath to predict just
stat these differers might be (do .wen prefer the anonymity of a large
deparbint or the oozy athcspbere of a snail departhent?), it sea's
worthwhile to determine whether departnent size exercises an irdepenient

effect on n 's choice of majors, aid whether its ml &gicn frau equation
(1) biases the ooefficient on ThCF24ft. Herx, we aagrnental aluatiai (1)
with the variable SIZEth, the number of sb.dents (female plus male) in

departzmnt i when the graduates of year t tare selectinj tlieir majors.22
Pare 1 C of Table 3 e,thi.bits the reaxltin efficients on FACFE24th

SIZEj. fey su3gest that department size does ret exert an iniepenient
13

effect on the propensity of females to major in a departoent, aid this

variable's irclusion does rc't sutstantially affect the coefficient ai

FAt.
r.ag stnrture. We have assaiel that a sQalan 's selection of her

major is basal squally on the gerder çition of the faaILty in her
first aid sacud years as a stixkzt. Hcs#ever, cthanes in the prcçcrtion
of female faufity might affect students' decisions with saie other lag.

'It investigate the poesibility that a results are sensitive to the lag
structure, we defined PaCFENl as the proportion of female facilty in
department I when the graduatirq seniors of year t were first-year

st*ñents aid That2

analogously. We then re-estl.xEated equation (1)

replacirg F7¼CFE}ljt with: a) E7CEnt, b) flcFDQth ard c) kcth flaDfl

Specification a) assts that the first year is formative;
b) assim it is the sard year; aid c) pennits toth years to matter, bit
does rct ctnstrain the effects to be the same. The results are reported
in Panel D of Table 3. The coefficients remain statistically

insiflficant. Merce, the atserre of gen3er effects does rct aear to be
due to a misecjfjcation of the lag structure.
Tenure Status. CAir nl treats all faailty bers the same,
regardless of their rank. However, to the extent that tern.ired faailty
have ucre prestige aid visibility than their rcn—tsrumal ct*.interparts,

then it might be ucre azur.jaiate to foais an the proportion of female

facilty in the tenured ranks only. We therefore aeatal the variable
TflIYflIkt, the analogue to FACEDç for the tenured faailty. We were able

to caistruct TENFH1 for Prfrcetcn aid Midnigan only; the results are in
Panel E of Table 3. They are rct very different fran their ThCFEXjI
14

cainterparts in Tables 2a ard 2b. Of irse, or cciild just as well. argue
that non—tenured faaalty are note relevant role nnieLs, because they are

relatively yain aM may be nore heavily involved In urxlerraduate

instructional pzwranE. Haever, when the fenale prcpartion of nontenurei facilty members is used as a right-hard-side variable, its

efficient is also statistically insignificant. We ncltde that taking
into a.int differer in faailty rank does not thane ar results.
Sciences vs. hunanities aM social scieires. The policy disaission

that surrairds air issue has focused on the desire to inrease fenale
representation in the sciei. Ha.?ever, ar basic specification pools
the sciences aM rw-sciezs together, operating on what we take to be
the reasonable viar that to the extent the noticn of gertler role nn%ls is
relevant, it applies synmEtrically to the scieis aM ra—sciences.

Nevertheless, it is possible that the processes governin sty into
different types of departrents differ, aM that by pooling thsn together,
we are oksaring the impact of faculty gerder airposition. Hence, we re—
estimated aiuat ion (1) using just the science departmants, aM then

repeated the press just for the humanities aM social sciences.23

Parl F of Table 3 sZn.s the efficients on FWFEN for the sciez aM
rat—science departuEnts. The a,efficients fran b,th regressions are

statistically insignificant.

The gerder cxlpmRition of the

faculty has no

note inportaire in science departhEnts than in the others.

Plftu the institutions. So far, we have estiunatsi eath nel
separately by instit.rtia,. Perhaps if all three data sets were used
together it ild be possible to obtain re precise estimates. We
therefore created a uniel suitable fa analyzing all three data sets
15

sUiiiltafl&5ly. The nr.del is a variant of aguation (1) in which 6, 62,

ard the departirent fixed at fts are allaed to vary by institution,
but the efficient5 on FACFEMt are constrained to be the sane.

Mechanically, this involved a?eatirq a dithotainis variable for each

institution, aid interacting it with each of the right-hard side variables
except FACFE}tj 24 Estliration of this ucdel with the pealed data set
yielded a coefficient on FAa'EM of 0.0714 with a standard error of
0.0888 • Thus, pooling the data does not change a by t.i, familiar
finding—the gender cnxpasition of a departnt' a faailty exerts no
statistically discernible effect on the gender cctçceition of its
undergraduate majors.
5.

(Xrclusjon

It is frp.ently asserted that fexiale undergraduate enroilnerits In

the sciei aid ergineerfrg caild be increased by raising fle
representation on the faailties in these areas. We have asseEbled panel
data fr three rather different n-brutjonaJ. institutions ant used then to

examine this proposition. The exaztric analysis inlicates that one
cannot reject the hypothesis that the gender ccziçosition of the students
in an acarian i c departnent is unaffected by the gender cnrceition of the

faailty at the tiii-e the stx3ents select their majors. This firkiilg holds
for each institution, aid is robust with respect to a ntzber of reasonable

alternative specifications of the statistical riniel.

Of cazse, this anaiysis mara ediausts tja posibiiities for
eipfricai nrk on this tic. The ut obvicus avenae f or futhre research

o.ild allca researchers to investigate whether role acdel effects are

present for se types of stixients aid rx,t others. Such effects are
diffialit to discern in a stixly lflce ors, tch relies on data at the
departirent level. Things are further ozziplicated by the fact that

Uneasirq fale faailty in certain disciplines might have long—term aid
irdirect effects by thfluertirq social definitions of awrcprjath majors
for nn aid wajtn. Having made these points, kwever, we believe that or

rearch shifts the brden of proof to t1e lwtio assert that hiring fuale
faailty in a deparbient is an efficaciazs way to increase its
uniergraduate female enrollments.

or results say anythirg re general aln,t the validity of the
wtion that females need role els to er.zrage than to enter artain
majors? The answer is clearly r. It a*ild be, for eenple, that young
.ren's decisions are driven by the preserx or aSez of female role
nrdels, bit these role ie1s awear in their lives before entering
llege. High school teachers, family nobers, aid xiblic figures ozzie to
mini here. \u-ther, even if female role nxlels don't affect choice of
major, they may affect Irst-ccllege aita, aich as the prcpensity of
ten in the departhent to go ai to graduate scthool. (See thstein
[1994].) Of irse, we must also ontaplate the possibility that a
person can be inspired by scare of arcther genier. the may want to

folla the lead of a person who is similar in race, ethnicity, religion,
soial backgrnzni, etc. Or perhaps role els don't matter very uzfli at
all— individuals de careers solely on the basis of their capabilities
and the constraints they face, the traditional vlsi in rnnics, as

in this area can ani shccld be subjectal to enpirical testliw.
