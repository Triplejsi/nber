UNEMPLOYMENT EFFECTS OF
MILITARY SPENDING: EVIDENCE
FROM A PANEL OF STATES

ABSTRACT

We use data on a panel of states over a 30 year sample to estimate the response of
unemployment to military procurement spending. The state panel provides greater variation in
both variables and permits us to examine whether responses to procurement spending shocks vary
across states. Our main finding is that changes in procurement spending significantly affect

unemployment in states heavily dependent on the military sector and subject to large such
changes, and that accounting for this variation in responses across states adds approximately 40%

to the estimated aggregate unemployment impact of the current drawdown.

Unemployment Effects of Military Spending:
Evidence from a Panel of States'
Mark Hooker and Michael Knetter

The ongoing reductions in military spending have revived policy interest in the

relationship between military spending and aggregate fluctuations.' A variety of
conventional macroeconomic models suggest that changes in military spending affect
economic activity, at least in the short run. The mechanism by which defense purchases

affect output varies across models. Military spending affects output through shifts in
aggregate demand in models in the Keynesian tradition. Other models emphasize the

reallocation of resources that occurs when spending changes across sectors of the economy
and

the consequent loss of output and increase in measured unemployment during the

transition period.2

The studies which accompanied plans to downsize the military in recent years
generally concluded that the proposed reduction in military spending, which amounts to a 3
percentage point reduction in its share of GDP over a 10-year period, would have relatively

minor effects on the macroeconomy. Simulation results from macroeconometric models
suggest, for example, that the planned drawdown will reduce annual output growth by

about 0.25 to 0.50 percentage points over the 1993 to 1995 period) Okun's Law would
thus imply a contribution to unemployment on the orderof one or two tenths of a
percentage point per year. Consistent with such a small impact, Shea (1992) finds that

military spending is not a statistically significant determinant of output in any 2-digit

Other empirical observations, however, suggest that military spending changes

have had large effects on the economy. Defense drawdowns associated with the conflicts
in Korea and Vietnam have tended to coincide with downturns in the overall economy.4

Figure 1 shows that the Korean buildup was associated with a decline in unemployment of
about 3 percentage points, while the subsequent drawdown was associated with a rise in
unemployment that was nearly as large. Similarly, the Vietnam buildup that occurred
during the Johnson Administration was associated with declining unemployment, while
unemployment rates rose soon after spendingon the Vietnam conflict fell.
Furthermore, the geographic distribution of unemployment increases in the recent

recession seems to be highly correlated with the distribution of defense spending. Four of
the states most heavily dependent on defense purchases—Connecticut, Virginia,
Massachusetts, and California—experienced a combined increase in their unemployment

rates that was over two-and-one-half times the increase in the rest of the United States in

the four year period ending in September 1992. Of the major manufacturing sectors in the
economy, the largest decline in employment in the 1989-1992 period occurred in
transportation equipment, with nearly two-thirds of that loss concentrated in aerospace

(aircraft and guided missiles). This leads us to believe that the distributional effects of
defense spending are important and that macroeconomeiric simulations based only on
aggregate data may be misleading.

Overall, there appears to be somewhat of a puzzle surrounding the true impact of

defense spending on short run fluctuations in the economy. Macroeconometric models
seem to agree that military spending changes of the magnitude we have seen since the

'

There was a sharp fall in output and rise in unemployment following World War Ii; more modest effects
were associated with the spending reductions near the end of the Korean and Vietnam conflicts. It should be
noted, however, that changes in defense spending as a share of the economy were larger in these previous
episodes than the current reductions. The Vietnam diawdown entailed a decline of 4.8 percentage points in
the share of ODP devoted to defense over a 10-year period. This compares with a projected decline of 2.9
percentage points over 11 years in the current environment. See the rcport of the Defense Conversion..,

World War II drawdown are too small to have big effects on the economy. Nonetheless,
past defense drawdowns appear to have coincided with national recessions and the regional

distribution of unemployment during the most recent recession is consistent with the view

that ongoing or impending defense spending reductions played an important role. This
paper will attempt to characterize the empirical relationship between military spending and
udemployment by examining the behavior of unemployment and procurement spending by
state since the early l960s. The panel of states provides us with considerably more

variation than exists in the aggregate time series. Our focus on procurement spending is a

consequence of our lack of state-specific data on other forms of military spending.

Procurement spending accounts for less than 50% of the current drawdown and
approximately 30% of total military spending.
We begin by discussing the empirical framework and data used to study the

behavior of state unemployment rates. We then estimate reduced-form models of state
unemployment rates and test a variety of resuictions in an attempt to identify key features of

the relationship between procurement spending and unemployment rates. Our main finding
is that changes in procurement spending significantly affect unemployment in those states
most dependent on the military sector, and that allowing for variation across states in the

response of unemployment to procurement spending adds approximately 40% to the

estimated aggregate unemployment impact of the cunent drawdown. The paper concludes
with some discussion of the implications of our results and possible mechanisms that might
generate them.

1. The Empirical Model
The main objective of this paper is to esthte the impact of military spending on
unemployment, using variation across states and over time to identify responses. One
possible approach to the problem would be to estimate a structural model of labor market
equilibrium, which would include determination of employment, labor force participation,

3

8,25/94

and wage rates, as well as unemployment for each state. However, labor supply, labor
demand, and labor market equilibrium are extremely difficult to model empirically. This is
particularly true given that our sample must cover a thirty-year period in order to capture

just two big swings in defense procurement. Thus, we estimate a system of reduced-form
unemployment equations for the fifty states plus the District of Columbia.
The specification we estimate is motivated by standard theories of labor market

equilibrium, as surveyed in Nickell (1990). We take the view that each state has along-run
equilibrium level of unemployment which will depend on minimum wages, environmental

and labor market regulations, industry mix, unemployment benefits, and other possibly
state-specific factors, but that unemployment deviates from long-mn equilibrium due to

various shocks, including changes in military procurement spending. The response of
unemployment to shocks will be allowed to vary across states to some degree.
We follow the approach of Marston (1985) and more recently Davis, Loungani, and

Mahidhara (1992) in specifying our equations for state unemployment rates. Marston uses
an error components model to decompose variation in state unemployment rates into time
and state effects. The state-specific effects capture institutional features that are relatively

constant over time but vary across states, giving rise to different long-mn equilibrium rates
of unemployment. The time effects capture the impact of factors common to all states that
vary over time, such as demographic trends and aggregate demand and supply
disturbances, many of which may be unmeasurable.6
In addition to the fixed effects, we consider other possible sources of state-specific
variation in unemployment rates in order to reduce omitted variables bias in our estimates of

the response of unemployment to military spending.7 Unfortunately, most shocks to
regional activity are difficult to measure. Two potential shocks we can measure are oil
6 Among the disturbances captured will be the common effects of fluctuations in defense spending across
states.
Of course one of the main reasons why military spending has been used as an instrumental variable in
macroeconometric research (e.g., HaD (1938) and Rarney (1989)) is that it is driven largely by noneconomic factors, making it unlikely that it would have systematic correlation with other driving forces.

prices and exchange rates. Oswald (1994) summarizes evidence that real oil prices are an
important determinant of unemployment rates for the industrialized countries. Carruth,
Hooker, and Oswald (1994) find that unemployment in Great Britain and Canada is
positively correlated with real oil prices. Their finding suggests that oil price changes do
not merely cause labor reallocation and search unemployment, since decreases in the price

of oil are associated with declines in the rate of unemployment. Earlier, Hamilton

(1983)

found that oil price shocks appeared to be associated with all butone post-WWll recessions
in the United States. The experience of the mid- 1980s in the United States suggests that

real exchange rate fluctuations may also have important differential impacts on

regional

unemployment due to state variation in exposure to international competition.

Research on state employment patterns has recently used an industry-mix variable,

proposed by Bartik (1991), to control for the share of employment changes that can be

associated with industry-specific shocks.8 Since industry employment growth is closely
related to industry unemployment, this variable would also be a good proxy for the effect
of industry shocks on state unemployment rates. Since the Bartilc variable is availableonly

from 1970-1989 and the rest of our data spans 1963-92, we perform most of our analysis
without it, but examine its impact on our estimated model over this sub period.
We begin by estimating the basic model given by:

where U denotes the unemployment rate, 111)8K denotes the dummy variable for the

factors on the state unemployment rates, which are assumed to be independent and
identically distributed.

The stare fixed effects allow the equilibrium unemployment rates to differ across
states and the time fixed effects allow for a common changes in the equilibrium rates (due

to, say, Federal environmental policy changes) or disequilibrium deviations (e.g. from
Federal tax changes) over time. The lagged unemployment term allows for persistent
deviations of unemployment from its long-run equilibrium rate, without taking a stand on
what the sources of persistence are. Deviations from long-i-un equilibrium may be
persistent either because some shocks are serially conelated or the labor market equilibrates

slowly. We assume that the dynamics of unemployment around its long-mn equilibrium

are the same for all states (i.e., the p's are common across states). Lags of procurement
contracts are included because contract work may be spread over several years and the

impact on the labor market may be delayed. As it is written, this equation suggests that
procurement spending is a determinant of the long-run equilibrium unemployment rate for

each state. Almost all theories of labor markets would imply instead that changes in
procurement spending cause temporary depanures from long-run equilibrium

unemployment. We will test whether the data are consistent with this view.

II. Data
Our unemployment data for each state cover the 1963-1992 period. We use CPS
estimates to the maximum extent possible, but for each state there is a transition year

between 1970 and 1976 in which data change from BLS Handbook method estimates to

CPS estimates. The BLS Handbook series is constructed from data on payroll,
unemployment insurance, and other work force records that are kept by state employment
security agencies.lO Since the CPS-based estimates are often quite different from the

handbook estimates in those years where overlap exists, we introduce a dummy variable

(HDBK) to capture the level-shift in unemployment rates associated with transition 1mm
handbook to CPS-based rates. The coefficients on these dummies are allowed to vary by
state, since the underlying factors which cause the two series to diverge are likely to vary

across states.t
Our military spending variable is real military contract awards per capita for each of

the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The raw data on contracts come from the DD

350 database, which consists of all prime contracts in excess of $25,000 awarded by the
Department of Defense.'2 Contracts are allocated across states according to the principle

place of performance.'3 Contracts vary in their length, or spend-out rates, which is one
reason why we include a number of lags in estimation. There are a few negative contract
values, which occur when more contracts are canceled than extended to a state in a
particular year. State contract data are deflated by the GDP deflator and the state

population. This has the effect of scaling the magnitude of the real shock to the size of the
affected economy.
Conflicting evidence on the economic importance of military spending cited in the

introduction may be partly a consequence of the small number of observations on aggregate

fluctuations and military spending. The time series on unemployment and military
purchases in the post-WWII period is probably too short to determine the appropriate

specification with confidence and thus to provide conclusive evidence on the issue. These
data on state unemployment rates and procurement expenditures provide us with not only a

The difference between the Handbook and CPS estimates varied by state quite substantially. The major
reason for this is that the handbook method did not represent all types of employment equally well.
Consequently, states with different compositions of urban vs. rural or manufacturing vs. service sector
employment were affected differently by the switch.

part of our sample, the cutoff value for the database was 510,000 per contract. Since prime
contracts between $10,000 and 525.000 accounted for such a small fraction of total contract awards, we have
ignored this definitional change in the series. In any case, it probably affected all states similarly, so would
have little impact on our results. The exclusion of subcontracts may introduce some noise into the model,
but there is no reason to expect any bias to result from the allocation of subeontracis across states.
For example, a contract with an auto dealer in ArizOna to deliver cars made in Michigan to a base in
Arizona would show up as a contract for the state of Michigan. where most of the value was added.

greater number of observations, but also a sample that exhibits greater variation.'4
Figure 2 displays the average level of procurement spending per capita for the fifty

states and the Disthct of Columbia over the 1963-92 period. The chart reveals large
differences in the economic importance of procurement spending across the states. Figure
3 shows that the time series behavior of procurement spending can differ substantially

across states. In the 1980s, for example, contract awards fell much sooner in Connecticut
and California than in Massachusetts. These differences in the timing of spendingchanges
across states provide us with additional variation to determine the role of procurement

spending in shaping unemployment. Figure 3 also reveals the greater amplitude in statelevel vs. national procurement spending.
State-level relationships between unemployment and procurement spending are not

perfectly analogous to the national relationship. The relatively greater opportunity for
migration across states within a country than across countries leads us to expect that the
relationship between unemployment and military spending is slightly weaker for states than

it is for the nation as a whole.15 Thus, the state-level analysis will probably lead to an
underestimate of the aggregate impact of procurement spending on unemployment.

Ill. Estimation and Results
We begin by estimating our basic model using OLS over the 1967-1992 period.

Our first exercise is to estimate Equation (1) settingfandKequal to4, which allows for
some dynamics without losing too many data points from our sample.

The results are presented in Table 1. We report two pieces of state-specific
information in the table: the stare-specific fixed effects (and their i-statistics) and an
14

Another option would be to collect data (or other countries, but we believe that spending per capita has

been substantially greater in the United States, so that looking at state data is likely to yield greater
vanalion across cross-sectional units and over time.

t5Topel (1986) and more recently Blanchard and Katz (1992) have shown that migration is an important
(actor in the labor market equilibiation process across regions in the United States. Undoubtedly, migration
plays a much smaller role across countries due to stricter immigration policies.

value calculated from the dependent variable and residuals for each staces observations.
The table also reports the estimated time effects and the coefficients on lagged
unemployment and real per capita procurement contracts.

Before discussing the response of unemployment to procurement, we note a few

other features of the estimates. First, the state-specific effects are quite sensible. The low
estimates are found in those states that are widely believed to have low natural rates of

unemployment—Nebraska. New Hampshire. Kansas, and the Dakotas. Chronic highunemployment states, such as West Virginia, Michigan, and Alaska, have larger estimated

state constants. The time effects change with overall economic fluctuations. The largest

positive values occur in the recession years of 1975. 1980, 1982, 1983, and 1991.
Whereas expansion years early in the sample tend to have negative estimated time effects,
those in the later years are positive, suggesting a common upward trend in the natural rate

of unemployment over our sample, which is consistent with most previous research on
natural rates of unemployment. Finally, it appeai; that departures from the natural rate of
unemployment have considerable persistence. The first lag of unemployment has an
estimated coefficient of 0.86 and the lag polynomial has a dominant root of 0.70.
The estimated responses of unemployment to contract awards, denoted with jJ's,
are in the lower left of the table. The contemporaneous contract awards have the largest
impact (-0.39) and the only statistically significant coefficient. The sum of all five

coefficients (contemporaneous and four lags) equals -0.45 with a t-statistic of -1.96. This
implies that an increase in procurement contract awards per capita of a thousand 1987

dollars (moving from being one of the least to most procurement-intensive states) would
permanently decrease state unemployment by about half a percentage point
Equation (1) implies that military spending affects the long-mn equilibrium
unemployment rate. Almost all economic theories imply that military spending only affects
deviations from equilibrium—i.e., the long-run equilibrium rate of unemployment in
Massachusetts is unaffected by a permanent change in the level of military contract awards

9

to that state. Since (1) nests specifications where changes in procurement spending affect
equilibrium unemployment, we can test whether the data accept the restriction implied by
theory.

Our next step is to test whether the basic model accepts the restriction that it is the

change in contract awards that affects the rate of unemployment, and not the level. The
results of this constrained specification are reported in Table 2. Since the fixed effects and
the lagged unemployment terms change very little with this change in specification, they are

not reported again. The coefficients on the lagged values of the change in procurement

contract awards (denoted by /s), however, are now all significant at the 10% level, and
they and the contemporaneous coefficient are each estimated to be approximately -0.30.

Their sum equals -1.29, (i-statistic = -2.66); the estimated impact on unemployment for the

current drawdown is presented in Figure 5 and discussed below.
The p-value for the test of the restriction that the military contract variable should

enter the specification in first-differences is equal to 0.05, which is at the border of the
rejection region for a standard test. However, our strong theoretical preference for the
natural rate of unemployment to be invariant to the level of military spending, and the
relatively large i-statistics on changes in procurement spending leads us to retain the
restriction for our analysis. We note that while theoretically difficult to rationalize, the data
express some preference for larger cumulative and more permanent effects of procurement

spending on unemployment.
Our next modification to the basic specification is to examine how the response of

unemployment to procurement spending varies across states. Initially we estimated a
model in which /s were allowed to be state-specific. Unfortunately, time variation alone

in this relatively short sample could not precisely estimate the state-specific s. To
alleviate this problem, we chose to group states into five quintiles, with Quinrile 1 having
the lowest levels of real procurement spending per capita and Quintile 5 having the highest.

This grouping brings in cross sectional variation to help identify the coefficients, and

10

8/25/94

allows us to analyze the hypothesis that state responses are heterogeneous based on the

level of spending in that state.

Two mechanisms may be at work underlying this heterogeneity: first, that
dependence on the military sector makes a state more sensitive to a given-sized shock in
that sector, and second, that states have different-sized responses to different-sized shocks

(that is, that the procurement spending-unemployment relationship is nonlinearly increasing

in spending changes). While we estimated with states grouped into quintiles by both of
these measures (the quintile members are presented in Table 3, with the estimates in Table

4A and 4B). a distinction is difficult: states with high procurement spending are also ones

with large changes (the correlation coefficient is 0.83). The sorting by level of
procurement spending leads to more significance in individual coefficients and a

significantly lower sum of squared residuals, so that is the specification we retain for most
of the analysis.

The results of grouping the data in this way and allowing the militaiy spending
coefficient to vary across the groups is presented in Table 3. The response of
unemployment to procurement spending is negaáve for Quintiles 3, 4, and 5, but positive

for Quindles I and 2. The inverse relationship between procurement spending and
unemployment is suongest in Quintile 5, where the sum of the contemporaneous and three

lagged coefficients is -1.82 with a t-statistic of -3.13. All of the individual coefficients in
the 5th quintile are significant at the 10% level and all but one at the 5% level. Two of the
coefficients in Quintile 2 are positive and significant at the 10% level, but neither are

significant at the 5% level.
In order to determine the economic significance of the differences in response
across the quintiles, we simulated the model to estimate the impact of the current

drawdown. For 1987-1992 we use the actual levels of procurement spending for each
state; for 1993-97 we assume that procurement spending will fall an equal percentage each

year to hit the projected 1997 spending amounts found in the 1993 Report of the Defense

11

8125/94

Conversion Commission. We also assume that the percentage reduction in spending after
1993 is equal across states. We assume that real per capita contracts remain constant after

1997.
Figures 4A through 4E show the responses with 95% confidence intervals for the

simulation. The first two quintiles show very small effects, with the point estimates
actually indicating a decline in unemployment as a result of reductions in procurement

contracts to those states. The three larger quintiles show adverse effects, with Quintile 5
showing a peak impact around 1995 of an additional 0.4 percentage points of
unemployment associated with the procurement drawdown. In all cases, the effects vanish

by 2003.
Another way to determine the economic significance of these differential responses
across the state groupings is to compare the aggregate implications of the simulated

drawdown under the assumption of identical responses across states venus the assumption

that the response differs across the quintiles. This comparison is shown in Figure 5. With
identical responses across states, the peak impact occurs in 1994 when procurement
cutbacks contribute an estimated 0.11 percentage points to aggregate unemployment
When responses are allowed to differ by quintile, the aggregate implications are greater by

about 40%, with peak impacts in 1993 and 1995 of 0.15 percentage points.
The pattern of response across the quintiles suggests that states with a greater

dependence on procurement spending have larger "elasticities' of unemployment with

respect to procurement spending. In essence, the unemployment "multiplier of
procurement is larger in states with higher levels of spending. We interpret this as
suggesting that the overall response of the economy to defense spending shocks is nonlinear: As the size of the shock increases, the multiplier effect of the shock becomes larger.

This same phenomenon may have an aggregate time series analog: Periods of large changes

in defense spending may also have proportionately larger unemployment responses. If the
true relationship between unemployment and defense spending is non-linear, then

12

8125/94

simulation models that assume a linear relationship may underestimate the response of

unemployment to large changes in defense spending.
In Table 5 we add two new controls to the basic model: oil prices and exchange
rates. While oil price shocks may cause macroeconomic fluctuations that are captured in

the fixed effects to some extent, these shocks have very different state impacts. Oil
exporting states, such as Texas, typically expand when oil prices rise, while oil importing
states whose industrial base is oil dependent, such as Ohio or Pennsylvania, will cpnnact
more than the national avenge during an oil price increase. Exchange rate fluctuations may
also have differential impacts on state unemployment.

Table 5 shows that the allowing for state-specific responses to these shocks does
not change the fundamental finding that procurement spending cuts tend to increase
unemployment (in the model with state responses constrained to be equal) and that these
increases are proportionately larger in states with a higher dependence on procurement

spending (in the model where each quintile has a separate response). The responses to oil
price and exchange rate changes are normalized around Nebraska. Texas, Wyoming,
California, and Alaska are among the few states in which oil price increases have a smaller

adverse impact (and potentially positive impact) than they do in Nebraska. Exchange rate
changes seem to have their greatest impacts on the New England and Midwestern states,

which is consistent with the findings reported by Singleton (1993).
Table 6 adds the Bartik variable to our model which is then estimated over the

shorter sample period during which this series is available (1970-1989). This sample
period misses some of the Vietnam buildup and drawdown and the latter part of the current

drawdown. Table 6A presents the results with the Bartik variable added to the basic model
with quintiles, which is reported as Table 3A. The Bartik variable itself does not
substantially weaken the negative relationship between unemployment and procurement
spending in the 5th Quintile, although it does weaken the relationship for the other

quintiles. The 5th Quintile is the only one to have a negative, statistically significant

13

8i25/94

coefficient sum. When all states are constrained to have the same response, the results are
nearly identical to those obtained in the basic model. Table 6B shows the results of adding
the Bartik variable to the expanded model with oil prices and exchange rates, which is

reported in Table 5. In this case, the constrained model shows a much weaker relationship,
but the pattern across quintiles does hold up. Quintile 5 still shows a definite negative
relationship between unemployment and procurement contract awards.
Overall, we fmd the evidence fairly convincing that procurement spending has

important short run effects on aggregate unemployment. Our point estimates suggest that
procurement cuts alone will add between one- and two-tenths of a percentage point to
aggregate unemployment during 1994-95, based on the aggregate implications of the

quintiles model. Since procurement cuts constitute only about half of the current
drawdown in military spending, the current drawdown may contribute about two- to fourtenths of a percentage point to the national unemployment rate in these years.

The more robust finding is that states wid. a higher average level of procurement
spending show a greater unemployment multiplier associated with procurement spending.

This pattern is evident in every specification. Only the ten most procurement-dependent
states exhibit a statistically significant relationship between unemployment and procurement

spending across all specifications. Nonetheless, the aggregate implications are greater
when we recognize this concentration of impacts: Allowing for different unemployment

responses to procurement across states also increased the aggregate sensitivity of
unemployment to procurement spending (Figure 5).
One possible explanation for the observed heterogeneity in unemployment

responses to procurement spending is that large regional shocks are exaggerated by
regional character of banking in the United States. Any region-specific shock has a
disproportionate influence on its banks, since their assets are not well diversified
geographically—they hold too many loans to regional businesses, which in turn are

collateralized by regional commercial and residential property. An adverse shock that is

14

8/25/94

large enough to cause increases in business failures and declines in property values may
create a "capital crunch," eroding bank capital and make lending to small businesses, which

rely almost exclusively on local banks for credit, extremely difficult at precisely the time it

may be needed most Small businesses that'have markets outside the region may be in a
position to absorb labor at relatively low wage rates given the supply of idle workers in the
wake of the original regional shock. Unfortunately, they may be unable to obtain credit

from local banks if a capital crunch is underway.
Is there any evidence that defense drawdowns have been associated with capital
crunches? We believe that the recent experience of regional property cycles is certainly

supportive of our view. The recent boom and bust of property values in New England and
California seem to coincide fairly closely with the defense spending cycles over this same

period. The growth and decline in defense spending was much more pronounced in New
England and California than in the remainder of the nation (see Figure 3). The evidence
that regional banking fueled the property boom is also quite striking. Peek and Rosengren
(1992) report evidence that shows real estate assets on the balance sheets of New England

commercial and savings banks rose by 242% from 1984 to 1989, when property values
appeared to peak. For the rest of the nation, growth in real estate assets among FDICinsured institutions was only 86%. This burst of lending for real estate development made
the New England banking system vulnerable to the rather sharp decline in property values

that began around 1989. This turning point in regional property values coincides nicely
with an important internadonal event: the fall of the Berlin Wall. Obviously, there were
other important factors that were influencing bank balance sheets and property values at this

time, but given the regional dependence on procurement spending, this shock may have
been the key ingredient. This is something we plan to investigate in future research.

IV. Conclusion
This paper has examined the relationship between procurement spending and
15

8/25/94

unemployment rates across states. There are two main findings. First is that military
procurement spending does explain some of the variation in unemployment across states,

and based on our estimates, the current cuts in procurement add about 0.15 percentage
points to the national unemployment rate. The impact of the defense drawdown is likely to
be twice as large, since procurement constitutes less than half of the spending reductions.

Second, we find rather strong evidence in support of a non-linear relationship between
these variables. In particular, procurement shocks cause proportionately larger increases in
unemployment rates in those states with a large share of procurement spending. This may

have important ramifications for forecasting the overall economic impact of defense
spending reductions. In particular, models that assume a linear relationship between
defense spending and short run economic activity are likely to underestimate the impact of a
defense thawdo'A r on the economy. It also has obvious ramifications for forecasting the

regional economic impact of spending changes.
Finally, we conjecture that this non-linear relationship between procurement
dependence and unemployment sensitivity is at least partly due to the lack of diversification

of bank assets across regions. A large regional shock is likely to induce regional credit
problems that magnify the impact of the original shock on other firms in the region.
Restrictions on interstate banking may have the unintended consequence of increasing the

amplitude of economic fluctuations. We will explore this possibility in future work.
