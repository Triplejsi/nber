HIGH WAGE WORKERS AND
HIGH WAGE FIRMS

ABSTRACT

We study a longitudinal sample of over one million French workers and over 500,000
employing finns. Real total annual compensation per worker is decomposcd into components

related to observable characteristics, worker heterogeneity, firm heterogeneity and residual
variation. Except for the residual, all components may be correlated in an arbitrary fashion. At
the level of the individual, we find that person-effects, especially those not related to observables

like education, are the most important source of wage variation in France. Firm-effects, while
important, are not as important as person-effects. At the level of firms, we find that enterprises

that hire high-wage workers are more productive but not more profitable. They are also more
capital and high-skilled employee intensive. Enterprises that pay higher wages, controlling for

person-effects, are more productive and more profitable. They arc also more capital intensive
but arc not more high-skilled labor intensive. We also find that person-effects explain 92% of
inter-industiy wage differentials.

1 Introduction
For several decades labor economists have lamented the lack of microeconomic data relating characteristics of firms to characteristics of their workers
(see, for example, Rosen (1986) and Willis (1986)) because such data would
permit researchers to begin to disentangle the effects of firm-level human resource policies from the effects of external choices made by individual workers. Why do high-compensation firms pay more than the apparent going
wage? Perhaps such a strategy delivers a gain in productivity or profitability that exceeds the incremental wage cost, as predicted by efficiency wage
and agency models.' Perhaps high-paying firms select workers with higher
external wage rates, thus sorting the workers into firms that have differential
observed compensation programs.2 Although broadly representati 'e linked
surveys of firms and workers are not available in the U.S., there have now
been numerous studies that attempt to relate firm performance to the design of the compensation system.3 Furthermore, many have analyzed the
inter-industry wage differentials among individuals as they were the manifestation of differences in firm level compensation policies. 41n this paper
we present the first extensive statistical analysis of the individual- and firmlevel heterogeneity in compensation determination. We examine variation in
personal wage rates holding firm-effects constant and variation in firm wage
rates holding personal effects constant. Due to the longitudinal nature of our
data, we are able to control for both measured and unmeasured heterogeneity
in the workers and their employing firms.
A high-wage worker is a person with total compensation higher than
expected on the basis of observable characteristics like labor force experience, education, region, or sex. A high-wage firm is an employer with :orn'See Lazear (1979), Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984), Hart and Hölmstrom (1987) and Sappington (1991) for concise statements of the theories generating these predictions. Tests of
these models have been performed by Abowd (1990), Abowd and Kramarz (1993), Cahuc
and Dormont (1992), Gibbons and Murphy (1990, 1992) and Hutchens (1987) Kahn and
Sherer (1990), Leonard (1990).
2This view is espoused by Bulow and Summers (1976), Cain (1976), Jovatiovic (1979),

and Roy (1951). Some tests of these models include Dickens and Lang (1985), Flinn
(1986), Gibbons and Katz (1991) and Heckman and Sedlacek (1985).

pensation higher than expected given these same observable characteristics.
Until now all empirical analyses of personal and firm heterogeneity in coinpensation outcomes have relied upon data that were inadequate to identify
separately the individual-effect necessary to classify a worker as high-wage
and the firm-effect required to classify a firm as high-wage. Using a unique
longitudinal data set on firms and workers that is representative of private
French employment, we are able to estimate both components of compensation determination, allowing for unrestricted correlation among them. In
the estimated models, we find that individual-effects are statistically more

important than firm-effects and that the two are not strongly correlated;
however, the economic interpretation of these statements is complicated by
the mobility patterns in the data. Although our statistical model allows
for the identification of both firm- and individual-effects, we show that for
many simple economic models, the structural heterogeneity of the workers
and employers is not identical to the statistical heterogeneity measured by
our descriptive model.

We use the results of our individual-level data analysis to relate firmlevel outcomes and choices to the structure of the firm's compensation policy.
Specifically, we ask whether firms that hire high-wage workers are more profitable (no), more productive per worker (yes), more capital intensive (yes),
more professional-employment intensive (yes), more skilled labor intensive

(no) and more likely to survive (yes). Second, we ask whether high-wage
firms are more profitable (yes), more productive per worker (yes), more capital intensive (yes), more professional-employment intensive (no), more skilled
labor intensive (no) and more likely to survive (maybe). Finally, we aggregate
our results to the industry level, where we find that high-wage workers and
high-wage firms are both explanations of the inter-industry wage differential
with high-wage workers being much more important empirically.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our analysis data
set. Section 3 describes our methods for identifying and estimating the large
number of statistical effects that characterize worker and firm compensation
heterogeneity and provides several potential economic interpretations of the

descriptive model's parameters. Section 4 describes our results. Section 5
concludes. A Data Appndix describes our manipulation of the French data
in great detail. Finally, a Model Appendix gives details of the theoretical
calculations

2 Data Description and Sampling Plans
Our sample of workers comes from the Declarations Annuelles de Salaires
(DAS), an annual survey of employer-reported earnings subject to French
social security taxes. We follow approximately one million individuals over
the years from 1976 to 1987. The sample is a 1/25th extract of the French
work force, excluding government employees (but including employees of
government-owned businesses). Our compensation measure is the real total annual compensation cost for the employee. This includes direct salary
and all benefit costs.5 The data source reports the number of days worked
per year. Part time workers were excluded. The total compensation measure
for part year workers was annualized on a base of 360 days per year. The
data included the individual's age, sex, location of job, occupation, and an
identifier for the employer. We supplemented these data with information
on the individual's education, available for ten percent of the sample and
imputed for the rest (see the Data Appendix). We followed workers and
employers across years and assigned a worker to the employer for which he
or she had the largest number of paid days in a given year. We refer to the
resulting analysis data file as the "individual data."
Our sample of firms comes from the annual survey BCnéfices Industriels
et Commerciaux (BIC), which collects a large amount of income statement,
balance sheet, employment and flow of funds information in support of the
French national accounts. We use a probability sample of 20,000 of these
firms, followed from 1978 to 1988, constructed by INSEE to facilitate research

on firms (INSEE, 1989, 1990a-1990c). Our measures of firm performance
include value added per employee, operating income as a I)roPOrtiOfl of total

assets and sales per employee. As measures of factor inputs we calculated
total real assets and total year-end employment. We added detailed measures
of the firm's employment structure (professional, skilled and unskilled) from
the annual Enquête sur la Structure des Emplois (Survey of employment
structure). We refer to the resulting analysis data file as the "firm data."
The worker and firm samples are linked using an identification number
(SIREN) for the employer that corresponds to a business unit—one or mimore

establishments engaged in a related economic activity. Thus, our analysis

division at INSEE.

of firm-effects is at the level of an enterprise and not at the level of establishments. We do not use the ownership structure of our firms. When the
enterprises change owners but remain in the same business, their SIRENs
do not normally change. Thus, we are able to follow the economic activity of our firms through most financial and ownership restructurations. We
use the linked individual-firm data to estimate the relation among various
compensation policies and firm-level economic variables.

3 A Statistical Model for Individual Compensation
The basic compensation equation for an individual is given by
Yit =

x/3 + O + 1I'J(i,)it + Ej

(1)

where y is the compensation of individual i = 1,..., N, for time t = F1, ...,
F1 is the first year an individual appears in the data, L1 is the last year s/he

appears in the sample, and the function J(i, t) gives the identity j of the
employing firm for individual i at date t. The effect x1/3 is the predicted
effect of time varying, person-specific characteristics

with 3 being a vector

of parameters to be estimated. The time-invariant individual-effect 0: S
decomposed as
(2)
O1=Os.+Ui7
where u, is a vector of observable time-invariant person-specific characteristics arid i is a vector of parameters to be estimated. The firm-effect 'J(i,t)it
is decomposed as

(3)
where cJ(i,t), 'YlJ(i,t) and '12J(i,t) are firm-specific parameters to be estimated,
SJ(j,t)It is individual i's seniority at date tin firm J(i, t) and the function Ti(z)
is the linear spline basis function6

zforz>0
?J(i,t) + 'Yi J(i,t)SJ(i,t)it •+• '12 J(i,t) Ti (sJ(1,t)1 — 10)

6The use of a linear spline at 10 years of seniority is a specification that we found better
suited to these data than a quadratic. As will become evident below, three parameters at
the firm level is already quite flexible and we did not find much to be gained by adding
additio- polynomial tems in seniority.

Finally, the error term e is stochastically independent of all other effects
in equation (1) with E[EJ 0 and Var[egJ = o. The stochastic structure
is unrestricted so that these effects may be crossof XtI9, 0, and
correlated. The identification conditions imposed upon the model are

and

Ijj2 ll)J(j) = 0.

3.1 Potential Interpretations of the Descriptive Model
We illustrate the relation between structural heterogeneity in the populations of workers (heterogeneous abilities or tastes) and firms (heterogeneous
efficiencies or technologies) and the statistical heterogeneity in equation (1)
using three economic models with very simple population structures. In each
case we derive the conditional expectation of individual compensation given

the identity of the employing firm and the individual. We then relate the
parameters of this conditional expectation to our statistical pararneterization
above.

3.1.1

A matching model with endogenous turnover

Suppose that workers are homogeneous. There are two types of firms, in and
n, and two periods. In type m firms a worker's marginal product and wage
rate are always w', and employment is always available in a type in firm. In

type n firms there is a matching process. Worker i's productivity is w + e
in both periods with
drawn from a binomial distribution B(—H, H, ).
The matching outcome, e,,, unknown to both the worker and the firm at the
beginning of the first period of employment, is realized at the end of the first
period and becomes public information. Workers are offered contracts at the
beginning of the first period of the form (w1, w2) and workers may leave firm
n at the end of the first period. All firms make zero profits. The equilibrium
contract for firms of type ri is (w —
+ es,). All workers in type n firms
with a bad matching outcome (—H) quit to type in firms.
To simplify the model, we consider a stationary situation with nine workers who flve for two periods each, three born in period 0, three born in period

,w

6

1, three born in period 2. Two workers in each generation enter type n firms,
one worker in each generation enters a type rn firm. Of the two workers who
entered type n firms, let one draw a positive matching outcome and the other

draw a negative matching outcome. The worker with the negative matching outcome leaves the type ii firm for a type m firm when the matching
parameter is made public.
The structure of the data implied by this theoretical model is shown in
appendix Table Bi. This corresponds to the following parameter values in
our descriptive model:

=W
where

is the overall mean;

where c is person i person-effect;
(cbm,"ym) = (0,0)

for the type in firm compensation policy; and

H 3H

(qn,fn) = (—--,——)
for the type n firm compensation policy.

3.1.2

A rent-splitting model with exogenous turnover

Suppose there are four different individuals, two types of firms, in and n,
and two time periods. Each of the two firms earns quasi-rents of q7, and
the quasi-rents are split by negotiation so that the workers receive a share
s, of the quasi-rent in firm j. Suppose that each firm employs two workers.
With probability one, exactly one worker is randomly selected to separate
from the period one employer and be re-employed at the other firm in the
second period. All information about the workers and firms is known to
those parties but not to the statistician. All workers are included in the data
sample and the typical worker has wages of the form:
Yit

Xi

where xj is the measure of wage rate heterogeneity, i.e. the worker type,
q follows a binomial distribution B(—Q, Q, ), i = 1..., 4, j
in, n, and
=
t 1,2.
Table B2 shows the relation among the theoretical parameters, x, s3, and
Q, and the statistical parameters of equation (1) for each worker and each
period. The model cannot be solved exactly. Thus, we use these relations to
solve, by least squares, the moment equations that determine the relations
between the statistical parameters and the model parameters. This yields:

3.1.3 An incentive model with unobserved individual heterogeneity
Following Kramarz and Rey (1994), consider workers who are heterogeneous
with respect to a parameter q E [0, 1], which is known to them but not known
to the firms. Suppose, furthermore, that there are two types of firms, m and

n, that differ according to their technology, and that there are two time
periods. At type m firms, workers are hired for one period and have a level
of productivity 11* regardless of their q. At type n firms, workers are hired in
period one, produce y regardless of their q, and choose an effort level, either
o or E, to exert during on-the-job training. At the end of the first period,
workers in firm type n take a formal, verifiable test. If worker q exerts effort
E, the test is passed with probability q. Otherwise, the test is passed with
probablity kq, where (0 < k < 1). At the beginning of the second period,
the firm decides which workers to keep and the workers may leave on their
own. Workers who exert effort E have a level of productivity in the second
period of y + Tq if they remain in a type n firm.
There are many type rn firms and two type n firms, which compete for
workers in both periods. Workers in type in firms always receive a wage
w. Workers in type ri firms are offered a wage contract (w1(q), w2(q), b(q)),
where w1(q) is the first period wage, w2(q) is the second period wage, and
b(q) is the bonus paid to those who pass the test. In equilibrium all finns of
both types make zero profits because of the competition to attract workers.
Furthermore, if y + S(y + Tq) is convex in q (6 being the rate of discount of
future earnings), the equilibriumcontract will be such that w1(q) y—qb(q),
w2(q) = y -I- Tq, and

b(q) =

All workers with type q, q p, will choose to enter one of the type n firms
and will choose to exert effort E when b(p)
To simplify the model, we suppose that rq =
and that parameters are
such that p = We also suppose that there are nine workers, three of whom
are employed by type in firms and the remaining six work in type n firms.

descriptive model. These equations can be solved in order to express each
parameter of the descriptive model using parameters of the theoretical model.
As in the rent-splitting model, the solution is not exact—we must use least
squares to express the function of the theoretical parameters that is closest to
the statistical parameter. To see why, consider the workers in type n firws.
Individual 7 passed the test and, consequently, received a bonus. This result
generates a seniority slope for individual 7. Individual 8 did not pass the test
and therefore received no bonus in period 2. Thus individual 8 has a diffeietii
seniority slope in the same firm. The statistical parameter -y,, measures the
average seniority slope in the firm n. Thus, the resulting estimated seniority
slope will be the least squares estimate of the average of the two slopes. We
illustrate these solutions for all the statistical parameters below.
The overall mean, p, is given by the following:

firm effects for in are not separately identifiable, since there are no movements

Although we do not attempt to recover the parameters of any particular
theoretical model from the estimates produced below, we will use the simple theoretical frameworks outlined in this subsection to comment upon the
results. No single economic model is likely to explain a large, diverse labor
market like the one we study. Nevertheless) it is important to keep in mind
that it is not always possible to make a direct interpretation of the statistical
parameters (for individual or firm) in terms of simple economic parameters.
In general, the interpretation of a given statistical parameter depends upon
all the elements of the economic model under consideration.

3.2 Computation and Identification in the Statistical
Model
In the context of equation (1), our goal is to estimate the invariant parameters /3 and 11 consistently in the presence of individual- and firm-effects that
may be correlated with the person-specific characteristics. Next, we want to
estimate 0, and J(i,t)it in a manner that allows us to use these estimates,
when averaged within a firm j, as potential explanatory variables for differences in firm productivity, profitability, factor utilization and survival. The
11

computational problem we face is that the least squares design matrix implied
by equations (2) and (3) is enormous and cannot be simplified using any of
the standard techniques in linear models (as, for example, in Scheffe, 1959).
There are over one million individuals and 500,000 firms (of which 14,000
have at least 10 individual-year observations) represented in our data. Thus,
eliminating the individual-effects from (1) by deviations from person-means

leaves a high dimension, non-sparse, non-patterned least squares equation
system to solve for the time-invariant and firm-specific parameters. Siinilarly, eliminating the firm-effects by deviations from firm-means (conditional
on seniority) leaves an equally complex least squares equation system to solve.
Finally, adopting Chamberlain's (1984) method of projecting the individualand firm-effects onto a set of person and firm characteristics, while permitting consistent estimation of /9 and i, complicates our second goal by forcing
us to model the firm-level effects of compensation policies directly in (1).

We adopt a variant of Chamberlain's method with a simplification first
proposed by Mundlak (1978). In our projection method we project the firmeffect onto a vector of firm and person characteristics constructed so as to
allow the desired correlation among the individual-effects, observable individual characteristics and the firm-effects. This permits consistent estimation of
/9 and least squares estimation of 0. The resulting estimates are then used to
produce consistent estimates of the firm-effects and of the firm-level averages
of the individual-effects, which we use in our firm-level analysis.
It is worth discussing why we rejected two potential computational sunplifications: sampling individuals and sampling firms, thus reducing the dimensionality of the person- and firm-effects to make the problem tractable.

The person effects are typically identified by repeated observations on the
same individual and the firm effects are typically identified by multiple employees in the same firm. When both types of effect are present in the same
model, firm-effects are identified by the presence in the sample of individuals
observed for multiple years and in multiple firms that employ other members of the sample. Without some movement of the individuals among the
firms, neither firm- nor person-effects are separately identifiable. However,
a relatively small amount of mobility suffices to identify many firm- arid
person-effects. The identification of the person and firm effects for individuals with at least two observations occurs whenever these individuals work at
least once in a firm that has at some point employed a person who changed
employers. When sampling individuals, as the size of the sample increases,
12

the representativeness of the estimated firm-effects improves because in small
samples of individuals the identified firm-effects are mostly from large firms,
whereas in larger samples the additional individuals increase the probability
that there will be a mover among the smaller firms. Furthermore, reducing
the size of the individual sample would have prevented us from estimating
firm-specific seniority returns because there are fewer and fewer firms with
adequate sample sizes as the sample of individuals is reduced. On the other
hand, when sampling firms we can estimate only selected firm-effects using
all the available individual observations, assuming that the firm-effects from
the nonsampled firms are zero. To obtain a representative, reasonably large
set of firm-effect estimates, this procedure would have to be repeated many
times (approximately 1,000 times to reproduce the firm-effects we have estimated by our preferred method). It is not obvious that this procedure offers
any computational advantages.
Regardless of the computational approach used, between-employer mo-

bility of the individuals is essential for the identification of our statistical
model. Table 1 examines the pattern of inter-employer movements among
all sample individuals. The rows of Table 1 correspond to the number of
years a person is in the sample. The columns, with the exception of column
(la), correspond to the number of employers the individual had. An individual contributes to only one cell (again, excepting column (la)). Notice
that 59.4% of the individuals in the sample never change employers (column
(1)).8 Approximately one-fifth of the single employer individuals worked in
firms with no movers while four-fifths (47.9% of the overall sample, coluiiin
(la)) worked in firms that, at one time or another, employed a person who
changed employer. Thus, 88.5% of the sample individuals contribute to the
estimation of firm-effects. It is also interesting to notice the pattern of employer spells among the movers (columns (2)-(10)). The second line of each
cell shows the most frequent configuration of employer spells for individuals
in that cell. In almost every case, short spells precede longer spells, indicat-

ing that mobility is greater in the early career (as Topel and Ward (1992)
found for American men). It seems clear from Table 1 that the data should
allow us to separate the individual-effect from the firm-effect.
8Notice that the cell (1,1) contains 318,627 individuals who appear in the sample during
a single year. Some of these individuals may represent coding etrors in the person identifier;
however, it is not possible to correct these errors.

13

3.3 A Projection Method for Estimating Correlated
Effects
Our proposed method allows us to estimate the parameters 3 consistently in
the presence of both individual- and firm-effects without adopting a step-wise
approach that imposes orthogonality among the different effects. We project
the firm-effect onto the firm and individual data according to the equation:
j(,t) + 7i J(it)SJ(it)ti •+• 7 .J(i,) Ti (sj(1,t)It — 10)

=

[fJ(,)t ® [i Sj(1,t)It Ti (sJ(1,t — 10) ] ® Xi] \ + 11J(i,t)it

3.4 Analysis of Firm-level Outcomes
We consider next the statistical relation between firm-level outcomes arid our
measures of firm-level compensation policy. Our basic model is

(29)

where j = 1, . . .J, the total number of firms in the firm sample, p is any
firm-level outcome, [ ci 11,ij
y, 72j } is a vector of firm-level compensation measures, r is a vector of parameters of interest, q is a vector
of other firm-level variables, p is a vector of associated parameters and
is a zero-mean homoscedastic statistical error. In the regression analysis,
firm-level outcomes and firm-level compensation variables were measured us-

ing data from two independently drawn samples. However, the firm-level

N, N5 —p oo,we assume that their ratio goes to a non-zero constant.

"We adopt the model of Pagan (1984) and Murphy and Topel (1985); namely, that the

(32)

where the components of Var [jj are defined in the derivations above. We
estimate equation (31) using generalized least squares based upon the error

4 Estimation Results
Table 2 shows the basic summary statistics, by sex, for the individual-level
data. The usable sample consists of 3,434,530 observations on 711,518 men
and 1,870,578 usable observations on 454,787 women. The basic individuallevel variables consist of labor force experience, region of France, education
level and seniority. Note that about 30% of the sample has no known educational attainment. For 74% of the individuals, there are enough observations
in the sample to permit estimation of a distinct firm-effect.'2 Recall from
Table . that some 27% of our individuals appear in only one of the 10 data
years while 10.6% are present for all 10 years. More than 59% of the individuals have only a single employer while 2, 3 and 4 employers account for
21.8%, 10.7%, and 4.8% of the individuals, respectively.
The results of our projection method for estimating the basic regression
parameters are shown in Table 3, separately for men and women. These
estimates are the results of applying the multiple step procedure presented
in section 3. The results shown in the columns "Projection Method," thus,
come from two separate regression models—the one shown in equation (2),
for the education coefficients, and the one shown in equation (9), for the
time-varying individual characteristics.13 For comparison purposes, Table 3
also shows the ordinary least squares results, the within estimates for fixed
'2The individuals from firms with fewer than 10 observations in thesample were pooled
and a single firm-level regression was used to estimate their firm-effects.
'3The remaining coefficients from equation (9) can be found in the Data Appendix. 'l'he
seniority coefficients shown for the projection method are the individual averages of
and 2j from Table 4.

19

person-effects and the within estimates for fixed firm-effects. Evidently, the

projection method results are much closer to the within-person estimates
than to those within firms whereas the least squares results are closer to the

within-firm estimates.

Table 4 contains descriptive statistics for the components of real compensation implied by the estimated parameters from equation (1) separately
for each sex. For both males and females, the standard deviation of the
individual-effect, and its components aand u, is much larger than that of
the firm-effect, and its components , yj and )'2. As noted in Table 3, the
complete parameterization in explains 80% of the variation in real salaries
for men and 75% for women; thus, the idiosyncratic component of variance
is still rather important.
Table 5 shows the intercorrelations of the components of compensation.
All components of compensation except the residual account for 81% of the
variance of real total annual compensation costs (combined result for males
and females). Furthermore, the a component of the individual-effect (the
part not explained by education) is more important than the observable regressors (xj3) in explaining compensation costs. The overall firm effect, ,
on the other hand, is only about one-quarter as important as the overall
person-effect. The individual-effect and the firm-effect are correlated 0.10
according to our results. The a and q components are correlated 0.08 according to this method. Notice that although the firm-specific intercept, ',
and the a-component of the individual effect are positively correlated, the
firm-specific intercept is negatively correlated with the seniority slope (-0.56).
One may get the impression from Table5 that the individual-effects and

firm-effects are not highly correlated. Table 6 shows that this is not com-

pletely correct. In this table we begin to address the problem of interemployer mobility in our sample. If the mobility in the economy is exogenous;
that is, if the probability of separation from one firm and accession into another does not depend upon the individual's wage path, then the association
of the parameter ctj with the pay practices of firm j is correct. Otherwise, the

movers and stayers systematically sort according to their values of a, , and
e. In this second case, measured values of firm-effects are contaminated by
the average values of individual-effects of the movers relative to the stayers,
as can be seen in the two endogenous mobility models discussed above.
For Table 6, the individuals were divided into three groups according to
their a's. High-a workers are much more likely to be observed in a single
20

job (one employer) whereas low-cr workers are relatively more likely to have
had three or more employers. High-cr workers also have more labor-force

experience. Although a and

are positively correlated, low- workers are

more likely to have had multiple employers. In particular the low-a low-gb low
experience workers are the most likely to have had multiple employers. Table
7 examines the mobility of high-cr versus low-cr workers explicitly. Persons
with low estimated individual-effects are much more likely to move between
low-ç5 jobs than are persons with high individual-effects (57% versus 40%).

Evidently the clean distinction between individual heterogeneity and firm
heterogeneity is called into question by this pattern. Do we estimate low cr's
because the individual has moved through a sequence of low-4' jobs or rather
because some employers are more likely to choose low-a workers, who are
more mobile for a variety of reasons? Our analysis does not provide a clear
answer to this question.
Table 8 presents summary statistics for the sample of firms (weighted
to be representative of private industrial firms). Table 9 presents regression
models for the logarithm of real value added per employee, real sales per
employee (measures of productivity) and operating income as a proportion
of total assets (a measure of performance). Using the firm-level compensation policy measures generated by our projection method, we note that a
larger value of the predicted wage (xfl-component) is associated with higher
value-added and sales per worker and higher profitablity. A larger individualeffect (a-component) is associated with a substantially larger value-added
per employee and sales per employee but not with higher profitability. The
part of the individual-effect related to education (wi-component) is associated with higher value-added per worker but is not significant in the other
two columns. Higher firm-specific wages (-component) are associated with
higher productivity (value-added per worker and sales per worker) and with
higher profitability. Neither seniority slope is associated with higher (or
lower) productivity or profitability.
Table 10 presents the results for the relations among our compensation
measures and a variety of firm-level factor utilization rates. Larger values of
the x/3-component of compensation are associated with higher employment,
capital, capital-labor ratio, professional employment proportion and skilled
employment proportion. The cr-component of the individual-effect is positivelv associated with total employment, total real capital, the capital-labor
ratio and the proportion of engineers, technical workers and managers in the
21

work force, and is negatively related to the shares of both skilled and uiiskilled workers. Larger values of the average education effect are associated
with higher total employment, total real capital and professional proportion but lower values of the skilled proportion. The firm-specific intercept
(ç-component of the firm effect) is strongly positively associated with total
employment, total real capital and capital intensity but is not associated with
any components of the skill structure of the work force. Employment proportions are not related to this component of the firm effect in compensation. A
high firm-specific seniority slope is positively associated with capital intensity
and slightly associated with the proportion of professional employees.
Table 11 presents a proportional hazards analysis of the relation between
the survival of firms and our estimated compensation components at the firm

level. Both components of the individual effect (a and the education part
uii) increase survivorship in a statistically significant manner. The effects
relatd to firm-specific compensation factors are large but very imprecise.
The effect associated with the x/3-component goes in the opposite direction.
Finally, Table 12 uses industry-level averages of the individual and firm
specific components of compensation to explain the industry-effect found
in our raw individual data (regression adjusted for labor force experience,
region. year, education and sex) in the spirit of Dickens and Katz (1987)
and Krueger and Summers (1988). Since the right-hand side variables in
this regression fully account for the industry effects in a statistical sense
(R2 = 0.97), the interesting question is the relative importance of indi\'idual heterogeneity (a-component of the person effect) and firm heterogeneity
(both and -y-components) as components of the industry effects. The third
through sixth columns of Table 12 present separate industry-level regressions

using first a alone (column 3 and 4) and then the three parts of the firmeffect by themselves (columns 5 and 6). It is clear from the fact that a alone
explains 92% of the inter-industry wage variation, whereas the firm-specific
components explain only 25%, that individual effects, as measured statistically are more important than firm-components. One should recall, however,
that in our example theoretical models structural firm and individual heterogeneity can influence both of the statistical measures.

22

5 Conclusions
In all likelihood, our analysis of the separate effects of individual arid firm
heterogeneity on wage rates and on firm compensation policies has raised
more new questions than it has resolved. We find that individual-effects
are a significant component of real total annual compensation variation.
Firm-effects, while also important, are not as important as individual-effects.
Firm-level heterogeneity and individual-level heterogeneity are not highly
correlated; however, mobility patterns suggest that the distinction between
an individual-effect and a firm-effect is not economically simple. Firms that
hire high-wage workers appear to be more productive per worker but not
more profitable. High-wage firms—those paying higher wages controlling for
the individual heterogeneity of the employees—are more productive per worker
and are more profitable. Both sources of wage rate heterogeneity—high-wage
workers and high-wage firms—are associated with more capital intensive firms.

We also estimated firm-level heterogeneity in the returns to seniority. This
component of wage variation is decidedly less important in our sample than
the tw pure heterogeneity components. We believe that our results provide
the statistical basis upon which to begin the process of testing the relevance of
agency, efficiency wage, search/matching, and endogeneous mobility models
as potential explanations for compensation outcome heterogeneity.

A Data Appendix
A.1 Description of the DAS
The Declarations Annuelies des Salaires are a large collection of matched
employer-employee information generated by INSEE (Institut National de
la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques). The data cover all individuals employed in French enterprises who were born in October of evennumbered years, with civil servants excluded.14 Our extract runs from 1976
through 1987, with 1981 and 1983 excluded because the underlying administrative data were not sampled in those years. The initial data set contained 7,416,422 observations. Each observation corresponds to a unique

establishment-individual-Year combination. The observation includes an identifier that corresponds to the employee (called ID below), an identifier that
corresponds to the establishment (SIRET) and an identifier that corresponds
to the parent enterprise of the establishment (SIREN). We have information
on the number of days the individual worked in the establishment, as well

as the full-time/part-time status of the employee. This allows us to aggregate all of the establishments in which an individual worked in a given year
and thus not treat changes of establishmemit within the same enterprise as
if they were changes of employer. Each observation also includes, in addition to the variables listed above, the sex, month, year and place of birth,
occupation, total net nominal earnings during the year and annualized gross
nominal earnings during the year for the individual, as well as the locatioii
and industry of the employing establishment.

A.2 Observation selection, variable creation and missing data imputation
A.2.1 Aggregation of establishments
The creation of the analysis data set involved the selection of desired mdividuals, the aggregation of establishment-level data to the enterprise level,
and tile construction of.the variables of interest from the variables already
'4Mcron (1988) shows that individuals employed in the civil service move almost exdusivelv to other positions within the civil servke Th,, the p'cc 1'in r,f cjvl rnt

37

in the data set. We selected only full-time employees (sample reduced to
5,966,620 observations). We then created a single observation for each IDyear-SIREN combination by aggregating within ID and year over SIRETs in
the same SIREN. For each ID-year-SIREN, we summed total net nominal
earnings and total days worked over all SIRETs. We used the occupation,
location and industry that corresponded to the establishrrient in which the
individual worked the largest number of days during the year. This reduced

the number of observations to 5,965,256. We then selected the enterprise
at which the individual had worked the largest number of days during that.
year (sample reduced to 5,497,287 observations). The aggregation of total
number of days worked across all establishments occasionally yielded obser-

vations for which the total number of days worked was greater than 360
(the maximum permitted). In these cases, we just truncated days worked at
360. We then calculated an annualized net nominal earnings for the ID-year
SIREN combination. We eliminated all years of data for individuals who
were younger than 15 years old or older than 65 years old at the date of their
first appearance in the data set (sample reduced to 5,325,413 observations).

A.2.2 Total compensation costs
The dependent variable in our wage rate analysis is the annualized real total
compensation cost of the employee (LFRAISRE). To convert the annualized net nominal earnings to total compensation costs, we used the tax rules
and computer programs provided by the Division Revenus at INSEE (.J.L.
Lhéritier, private communication) to compute both the employee and employer share of all mandatory payroll taxes (cotisations et charges salariales
employé et employeur) Total annualized compensation cost is defined as the
sum of annualized net nominal earnings, employee payroll taxes and eiiiployer
payroll taxes. Nominal values were then deflated by a consumer price index
to get real annualized net earnings, and real annualized total compensation
cost. We eliminated 61 observations with zero values for annualized total
compensation cost (remaining sample 5,325,352).

A.2.3 Education and Total Labor Market Experience
Our initial DAS file did not contain education information. We i.ised sunpleineritary information available for 10% of the DAS, (EDP, Echiiihloim
38

Démographique Permanent) to impute the level of education of all iiidividuals in the DAS.15 The EDP includes information on the highest degree
obtained. There were 38 possible responses, including "no known degree."
These responses were grouped into 8 degree-level categories as shown iii table 1. Using these eight categories and data available in the DAS, we ran
separate ordered logits for men and women to estimate coefficients used to

impute education for the individuals in the DAS who are not part of the
EDP. EDP sample statistics for the men are in table 2, and those for the
women are in table 3. The estimated logit equations are in table 4 for men
and table 5 for women.

15Access to the EDP is particularly difficult to obtain due to privacy regulations.

With these estimated coefficients, we were able to calculate the probability that a given individual would have a degree in a particular category. We
used the data corresponding to the earliest date that an individual appeared
in our sample to calculate these probabilities. The probability that a given

individual i has a degree in category n was calculated as follows. For au
ñ E {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, let

PREr = exp

(x),

X represents the vector of covariates for individual i and /EP corresponds to the vector of coefficients for degrees of category ñ. Let
where

PRE =

PRE.

Now, if ii E {1,2,3,4,5,6,7},
P (degree categoryg =

PRE

=
1

+ PREI'

and if ;i = 8,

P (degree category = 8) =

1 —

P (degree categoryg =

We used this degree category (actual, where possible, otherwise ilfl1)Uted) fur

all observations on the individual.
To calculate school leaving age we used table 14 in CEREQ-DEP-IN SEE
(1990), which provides the average age of termination for each French diploma
separately for men and women in 1986. Using the probability of each degree category and the average school-leaving age for degrees in that category
(the ages were fairly homogeneous within categories), we calculated ex1)ected
school-leaving age.

A.2.4 Job Seniority, and Total Labor Market Experience
Individuals fell into two categories with respect to the calculation of job
seniority (employer-specific experience): those for whom the first year of
observation was 1976 and those who first appeared after 1976. For those
51

individuals whose first observation was in 1976, we estimated the expected
length of the in-progress employment spell by a regression analysis using a
supplementary survey, the 1978 Enquête sur la Structure des Salaires (ESS,
Salary Structure Survey). In this survey, respondent establishments provided
information on seniority (in 1978), occupation, date of birth, industry, and
work location for a scientific sample of their employees. Using the ESS information, we estimated separate regressions for men and women to predict
seniority in 1976. The coefficients from these regressions were used to calculate expected job seniority in 1976 for DAS individuals whose first observation was in 1976. The dependent variable in the supplementary ESS regressions was current seniority with the employer and the explanatory variables
were date of birth (DOB), occupation (CSP, 1-digit), region of employment
(metropolitan Paris), and industry (NAP 100, approximately 2-digit).16 Table 6 provides sample statistics for the ESS data. Results of these regressions
'6The excluded categories were: 1960<DOB1, CSPG2 (1 if i is an Unskilled Blue-Collar

Worker at Date t in firm J(i i)), and N89 (1 if firm J(i, t) is in industry 89, Financial
Organizations). The coefficients on the industry indicators are not shown below.

We used these results to impute levels of job seniority in 1976 for the
left-censored DAS individuals first observed in 1976. If the individual was
left-ensored and the imputed job seniority was negative, we set job seniority
prior to 1976 to zero. If the individual was first observed after 1976, we assumed that job seniority prior to the date of the first DAS observation for the
individual was zero. If the age at the date of ally observation (1976 or otherwise) was less than the expected school-leaving age, both total labor force
experience and prior job seniority were set to zero. In all other c?tses (when

CSP3Ol,,J(l,) =
CSP40,.t,J(I) =

1

55

the age was greater than the expected school-leaving age), we calculated total labor market experience and job seniority as follows. If the observation
was the earliest appearance of the individual in our data, we set job seniority
equal to job seniority up to the date of the first observation plus the number
of days worked for that enterprise in the year of the first observation, divided
by 360 and we set total labor market experience to the current age less the
school-leaving age. If the observation was not the first for the individual but
there was an observation in the previous year for the person17, we added
1 to total labor market experience. If the individual was employed for the
majority of the current year by the same enterprise that employed him or her
for the majority of the previous year, i.e. SIRENS = SIREN_1, we added
1 to the level of seniority at t — 1. if SIRENS SIREN_1, we set seniority
equal to the number of days worked divided by 360.
If, on the other hand, there was no observation in the previous year, we
distinguished between t = 1982 or i = 1984 and other years. When t 1982 or
1984, total labor market experience was increased by 1 (reflecting experience
gained in the year of the observation). If the current SIREN and the most
recent previous SIREN were the same, we added the number of days worked
over 360 to the most previous level of seniority. This is similar to assuming
that the worker was temporarily laid off, but retained his or her seniority in
the firm when recalled. Otherwise, we set seniority to the number of days
worked over 360.

In the case where t = 1982 or t =1984, if the preceding observation was 2
years earlier (i.e. the missing data only occurred over a period when no data
were available for any individual), we increased total labor market experience
by 2. If SIREN_2 = SIREN,seniority was increased by 2. If SIREN_2
SIRENS, seniority was increased by 0.5 plus the number of days worked over
36018.

'7The structure of our database is such that this condition (observations for individual i
at both t and t — 1) could only fail to be satisfied under 3 conditions. The first is that the
individual was employed in the civil service in the intervening years. The second is that
the individual was unemployed for an entire calendar year. The third is that i =1982 or
t =1984, since we were not given access to the data for these years. We largely discount
the first possibility, since full-time civil servants rarely move out of the civil service one
they have entered (Meron (1988)). The other two possibilities are treated explicitly.
'8We assumed that the probability the individual was reemployed in the missing year was
equal to the probability that the individual was rcemployed in the observation year. Thus
the expected increment to job seniority is the share of the year worked in the observation

56

If the preceding observation was more than 2 years earlier, we increased
total labor market experience by 1.519. If the current SIREN and the most
recent previous SIREN were the same, we added the number of days worked
over 360 plus 0.5 to the most previous level of seniority. This is similar
to assuming that the worker was recalled from temporary layoff with equal
probability in the observation year and in the missing year. If the two SIRENs
were different, we set seniority to 0.5 plus the number of days worked over
360.

A.2.5 Elimination of Outliers
After calculating all of the individual level variables, we eliminated observations for which the log of the real annualized total compensation cost
(LFRA1SRE) was more than five standard deviations away from its predicted value based on a linear regression model with dependent variable

LFRAISRE, shown in equation (36). This gives us the analysis sample
year plus ( 0) + ( . 1) = 0.5.

'9We assumed that the probability the individual was reemployed in the missing year
was equal to the probability that the individuatwas reemployed in the observation year.
Thus the expected increment to total labor market experience is ( . 1) + ( .2) = 1.5

A.3 Supplementary information on projection method
variables
The derivation of the individual and firm effects took place in three basic
steps: an estimation of the "first-step equation" derived as equation (9),
an extraction and decomposition of the individual effect (os) into observable (u1i) and unobservable (ag) components, and a decomposition of the
into the enterprise-specific constant effect (j),
correlated component
the enterprise-specific coefficient on seniority (yij) and the cntcrprisc-specific
coefficient on the linear spline at seniority of 10 years (y23).

58

A.3.1 The First-Step Regression
Equation (5) represents the projection of the firm-specific variables onto firm

and individual data. In order to estimate the first-step equation (9), we
require (in addition to the seniority variable derived in section A.2.4 above)
some firm specific variable (denoted fJ(,t)t in equation (5)) and a vector of
means of some individual specific variables (denoted in equation (5)). We
calculated firm employment directly from the firms represented in the DAS
data. The sampling scheme of the DAS ensures that we have a sample
of the private French working population. Since we have 10 years worth of
data on the French economy, we calculated fJ(1,g)as:
fJ(i,t)

= (2.5 x Number of DAS Observations for Firm J(i, t)) — 8.3.
1000

Although this measure does not vary over time for a particular firm, it does
vary over time for an individual who changes employers, which is the essence
of our identification of firm effects relative to individual effects. The vector x
in equation (5) includes time-varying individual-specific variables. The vector
in equation (5) contains the individual specific means of the two individualspecific variables onto which the firm effect was projected: individual i's total
labor market experience and total labor market experience squared at date
t. These individual-specific means were used in the calculation of the matrix
z. Table 7 presents the variables appearing in the matrix Zt.
The first step equation (9) requires that the variables all be restated in
terms of deviations from individual-specific means shown below for men with

A.3.2 Imputed firm effects
For individual in firms with insufficient data to calculate a firm effect (less
than 10 observations in the firm), we ran a single regression of equation (17),
pooling all of the data and assigning the estimated coefficients to all firms
in the group. This group included 1,353,794 observatons (26% of the total),
although it represented 86% of the firms. The results of the regression on
this g:oup are presented in equation (39).

A.4 Construction of the Firm-Level Data
A.4.1 Calculation of the Firm-Level Averages

,

We need to calculate os,, uT/ and their respective variances based on the

where T1 represents the number of observation for individual i for which he

or she is employed in firm j. The variances of c, uii are calculated as
>2 [Var(u) T13]

>2 [Var(o) T1}

Var(a3) =

Var (ujii)

*

(T)

since each cand Ujlj is a random variable with known variance. The variables
c5.,, ii3 and Y2j already have unique values for a given SIREN (enterprise).
Unfortunately, even having restricted estimation of firm-specific ,, 7i3 and
'12j to those SIRENs for which we had 10 or more observations, we still
3 or
ended up with some outliers. Thus, in cases where either —3
—2
2 or —2
2, we set , y', and 'Y2j equal to the
Yi. + 72j

values estimated in the pooled regression. Weighting by individual-years,
this affected only 0.15 percent of the observations in our sample.

A.4.2 Firm-level Employment and Capital Stock
The variable EFFEC (effectif, in thousands of workers) measures the total
full-time employment in an enterprise as of December 31 (prior to 1984)
and the annual average full-time employment (1984 and later) as found in
the BIC. We then took its mean over all years that the firm appeared in
the sample to get MEFFEC, the mean number of employees. Total capital
in the enterprise is defined as the sum of Dettes (Debt) and Fonds propres
d'entreprise (Owners' Equity). Our capital measure is equal to Actif total
(Total assets) in French accounting systems. This information was taken
62

directly from the BIC for every firm-year. We used a sector-by-sector, time
varying index of the cost of capital (KAPP, 1980=100), available from the
Banque de Donées Macroéconomiques (BDM). CAPITR is defined as total
capital divided by cost of capital (in millions of 1980 FF). MCAPITR is
the annual average of CAPITR over all available years for the firm. The
capital labor ratio is defined as CAPITR/EFFEC and its annual average is
MCAPITRF (thousands of 1980 FF)

A.4.3 Real Operating Income per Unit of Capital
We used the BIC to obtain the Excédent brut d'exploitation (Operating
Income), or EBE, for each firm in each year that it appeared in the firm
sample. The formula used to calculate the EBE is shown in equation 40.

EBE =
—
—

ventes de marchandises (merchandise sold)
achat de marchandises (merchandise purchased)

variation de stock de marchandises
(variation in merchandise inventory)

+ ventes de biens (goods sold)
+ ventes de services (services sold)
+ production stockée (inventoried production)
+ production immobilisée (unfinished production)
—
achats de matièrespremières (primary materials purchased)
— variation de stocks sur matières premieres
(variation of primary materials inventories)
— autres achats et charges externes
(other purchases and outside charges)
+ subventions d'exploitation (incentives for production)
—

impôts, taxes et versements assimilés

—

(value added tax and other accrued taxes on
or credits for production)
salaires et traitements (salaries and benefits)
charges sociales (payroll taxes)

—

(40)
The EBE was deflated by the prix de valeur ajoutée (value added price index),
also found in the BDM, to yield EBER (thousands of 1980 FF). EBER was

divided by CAPITR (times 1,000) to yield EBERC, real operating income
63

per unit of capital (1980 FF). Lastly, we took the mean of EBERC over all
of the firm-years to get MEBERC, mean real operating income per unit of
capital (1980 FF).

A.4.4 Real Value Added Inclusive of Labor Costs
To calculate the valeur ajoutée réelle brute au coit des facteurs-(real value
added inclusive of labor costs), VABCFR, we divided the frais de personnel
(employer's compensation cost) from the BIC (thousands of FF) by the indice
des prix a la consornmation (consumer price index) from the BDM to yield
the employer's real compensation cost (thousands of 1980 FF). The results
was added to EBER, as defined above in section A.4.3, to yield the VABCFR,
real value added inclusive of labor costs (thousands of 1980 FF). VABCFR

was divided by EFFEC to yield VABCFRF, real value added inclusive of
factor costs per worker (1980 FF). We took the mean of VABCFRF over all
of the years that the firm appeared in the sample to get MVABCFRF, mean
real value added inclusive of labor costs per worker (1980 FF).

A.4.5 Employment structure
The variable MING, proportion of engineers, technicians and managers in
the work force (EFFEC), was calculated from the ESE using the PCS occupation classification (35) for individuals in categories 30 and 40. MOQA, the
proportion of skilled workers in the work force, was calculated from the ESE
using the PCS occupation classification (35) for individuals in categories 50
and 61. Both variables were expressed as a ratio to EFFEC and averaged
over all the available firm-years.
