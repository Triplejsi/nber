MONETARY POLICY AND THE TERM
STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES
ABSTRACT

This paper addresses a prominent empirical failure of the expectations theory of thetemi

smicture of interest rates under the assumption of rational expectations. This failure concerns
tL magnitude of slope coefficients in regressions of short rate (or long-rate) changes on long-

short spreads. It is shown that the anomalous empirical findings can be rationalized with the
expectations theory by recognition of an exogenous random (but possibly autoregressive) term

premium plus the assumption that monetary policy involves smoothing of an interest rate
instrument -- the short rate -- together with the responses to the prevailing level of the spread.

Introduction
In a recent paper. McCallum (1994) argues that a prominent empirical

puzzle involving exchange rate behavior——namely, the drastic apparent failure

of uncovered interest parity-—can be rationalized as a consequence of
systematic monetary policy behavior that has been ignored in most previous
Studies.

Here it will be argued that a similar result is applicable in the

context of an apparent failure of the expectations theory of the term
structure of interest rates.

In particular, the failure of short—rate (and

long—rate) changes to be related as predicted to prevailing long-short
spreads is shown to be a plausible consequence of monetary policy behavior
that features interest rate smoothing in combination with policy responses to

movements in the long-short spread.2 This explanation is entirely consistent

with, but more general and more fully developed than, the one proposed in a
notable study by Mankiw and Miron (l986).

The paper's organization is as follows.

In Section II,

the

term—structure puzzle is reviewed and the paper's rationalization is
developed for the simplest two—period case.

Then in Section III, the

analysis is extended to long rates of greater maturity.

Additional evidence

is developed in Section IV and concluding remarks appear in Section V.
II.

Two—Period Case

In this section

we consider the issue and our proposed explanation for

the two-period case, i.e., for the relationship between yields on one—period

and two—period bonds, denoted rt and R respectively.

I would suggest, not only that the usual regression test is inappropriate but

also that it Is misleading to think of the expectations theory in terms of
the "predictive content" of the spread for future changes of the short rate.
Such predictive content is not a necessary implication of that theory.

In addition, a zero slope coefficient would be implied if A = 0,

This

special case, of the

1, represents the hypothesis of Mankiw and Miron

(1986)-—that the Federal Reserve has practiced interest rate smoothing and

thereby induced short rates to approximate a random walk process In their
behavior.

Our result strongly supports the general idea of the Mankiw and

Miron hypothesis, but shows that it holds even if rt behavior is not that of
a random walk.

A few readers have remarked that (14) appears to be inconsistent with
the fact that a regression of form (3) should yield a slope coefficient of
1.0 in the special case in which the term premium

implies that R —

rt

Thus there is a degenerate regressor, in this case, so the

regression cannot be conducted. And in the case with 0 < 1.0, (14) does not
apply so again there is actually no inconsistency.
Let us now briefly consider the situation with u• < 1.

In such cases we

would need to include a non—zero constant term in (5) to permit a stationary

equilibrium with E = 0.

The solution In this case yields a relationship

analogous to (14) that is less tidy than the latter, and Includes additional
predetermined variables.

But it remains true that the probability limit of

the slope coefficient In a regression of rt —

N—Period Case

Now we turn to the more interesting case in which the long rate, R, is

for a bond with a maturity of more than two periods.

In this case an

approximation to the expectations—hypothesis relationship between R and rt
can

be written as

(15) R —

E(R,1 —

where N+1 is a measure of the duration of the long rate.14

In (5) the

left-hand side is an approximation to the one—period holding return on the

long—rate bond, the inexactness arising because the term R should pertain

to a maturity one period less than that for R.

Thus for many-period

maturities, the approximation should be adequate. 15

In this case the apparent empirical failure to be explained arises from
writing (15) as

were constant, the Slope coefficient

should have a probability limit

of 1.0 according to the expectations theory.

But such regressions again

actually yield slopes well below 1.0 with U.S. data.

Indeed, the values

reported by Evans and Lewis ('1994) and Campbell and Shiller (1991) are
predominantly negative, as is documented in Table 2, and increase in absolute
value with N.

Additional Evidence

The paper by Campbell and Shiller (1991) concludes with an attempt to
provide a summary characterization of term structure behavior that would be
consistent with their battery of empirical findings, which Include many more
than those reported here.

They

explore the implications of these two summary characterizations of ways In
which the expectations theory might fail and conclude that (27) is consistent
with the data but that (26) Is not.

Let us consider how these characterizations compare with the explanation
of the present paper.

Looking back at Section II, we see that equation (12)

It was mentioned above that the slope coefficient reported in Table 1
for the years 1890 - 1914 was closer (than for more recent periods) to the
value of 1.0 that has been focused on in previous investigations.

As Mankiw

and Miron (1986) emphasize, those years precede the founding of the Federal

Reserve System and therefore pertain to a period during which interest rate
smoothing behavior would be absent.

In a similar vein, Kugler (1988, 1990)

finds that slope coefficients are closer to 1.0 for Germany and Switzerland
than for the United States during recent years. This result he attributes to

a smaller degree of interest smoothing behavior

by the Bundesbank and the

Swiss National Bank. in comparison with the Fed, a hypothesized behavioral
difference that is consistent with the beliefs of many students of central
banking behavior.

Since the model in Sections II and III presumes a

substantial degree of interest rate smoothing, this paper's explanation is
consistent with both of these findings.

Concluding Remarks
The discussion of the foregoing paragraph suggests

that one

possible way

of conducting additional tests of this paper's hypothesis would be to
consider different monetary policy regimes corresponding

to

different time

periods for the United States and to different nations. Reaction functions

corresponding to (5) would be estimated and the implications of their
parameter values for the crucial slope coefficients then compared with values

of the coefficients obtained for these different regimes. Now, it may prove
possible to make some progress toward execution of such a study. There is,
however, a substantial difficulty that needs

to be

mentioned. Specifically,

it is the case that actual central banks do not respond only to term spreads

Thus equation (5) represents a

in deciding upon changes in rt.

simplification relative to actual behavior of the Fed, which almost certainly

responds to recent inflation and output or employment movements as well as
the spread.

So, if one were to attempt to econometrically estimate actual

reaction functions, then measures of inflation and output gaps would need to
be included.

But in that case values of these variables would need to be

explained endogenously, so the system of equations in the model would have to

be expanded. Furthermore, the dynamic behavior of inflation and output would
need to be modeled "correctly," which is an exceedingly difficult task given
the absence of professional agreement about short—run macroeconomic dynamics.

In short, this type of study would require specification and estimation of a
complete dynamic macroeconometric model.

In light of the foregoing discussion it will be seen that, because of

the simplified nature of our policy equation (5), this paper's proposed
explanation might be regarded as more of a parable than a fully—worked—out
quantitative model.

I would argue, however, that this is not a source of

embarrassment, for most knowledge in economics is actually of the parable

14

type.21

The relevant issue is whether a proposed parable Is fruitful in

understanding Important economic phenomena.

In this particular case the

proposed parable suggests that slope estimates in regressions of the form (3)

or (16) differ from 1.0 despite the validity of a versidn of the expectations
theory of the term structure. This version permits the holding—period yields
on securities of various maturities to differ by a random discrepancy that is

exogenous but perhaps serially correlated. The basic idea of the parable is

that the estimated slope coefficient is a composite parameter reflecting
policy behavior as well as the behavior of market participants, with the type

of

policy postulated involving interest rate smoothing and response to the

long—short spread, the latter reflecting important aspects of the state of
the economy.

The fact that essentially the same parable can

rationalize

a

major anomaly in foreign exchange markets must be regarded as a significant
mark In its favor.

3SInce drafting this paper I have become aware of a study with a rather

similar objective by Rudebusch (1994). which is also intended to provide a
generalization of the Mankiw-Miron hypothesis.

The type of policy behavior

assumed there is quite different, however, as instrument settings are
responsive to current conditions In my setup but are determined exogenously
in his.

Most significantly, Rudebusch's analysis does not offer an

explanation for the empirical phenomena rationalized below at the end of
Section III and in Section IV.

4The relationship is exact, if the interest rates are based Ofl Continuous
compounding, or an approximation otherwise: see Shiller (1990).

analogous result holds for the case of three—month and one—month rates;
see Kugler (1988, 1990).

6The Roberds, Runkie, and Whiteman (1993) results

are for treasury bills.

This study also reports results using Federal Funds and Repo securities and

finds one slope coefficient close to 1.0 for the former using the sample
period 1979. 10 — 1982. 10.

Froot (1989).

10Some analysts are dubious that the Fed's control over the one—day Federal

Funds rate translates into effective control over one—month or three—month
treasury bill rates that are the operational counterpart of rt in (5).

But

the evidence of Cook and Hahn (1989) suggests that three—month rates do, In
fact, respond within the day to policy—induced changes in the Federal Funds
rate.

Furthermore, if the Fed doubted its ability to control treasury bill

rates it could (given its holdings) operate directly in the treasury bill
markets. Consequently, doubts concerning the controllability of rt seem to
be unfounded.

It is not clear

any event, the policy

behavior pattern In his article has a substantial degree of similarity with
formulation (5): both call for an increase In the short rate In response to a

12Students of the price level determinacy literature——e.g., McCallum (1981)
(1986), Dotsey and King (1983), Canzoneri, Henderson, and Rogoff (1985)--wlll

wonder about the absence of nominal variables in the system (1)(5).

But the

price level can be brought in by adding (e.g. ) an IS—type relation in which a

real rate such as rt —

appears. Pt

Then determinacy of Pt will require the presence of an additional

term in (5), one that includes a nominal variable such as Pt or Ep+1 or
Pt-i.

Algebraic analysis becomes much more difficult because the counterpart

of (10) below will be a cubic in many such cases. But a cubic must have at
least one real root, so in principle determinacy can be investigated.

My

examination of a case with Pt included in (5) indicates that determinacy
would be guaranteed unless o =

exactly.

Thus for a close to 1.0, the

results would be approximately the same as those emphasized below.

This approximation has also been used by Shiller,

Campbell, and Schoenholtz (1983), Campbell and SMiler (1991), Fuhrer and
Moore (1993), and Hardouvells (1994).

The larger is

many long rates can be considered.

This

effect reinforces the tendency for the slope coefficient to increase in
