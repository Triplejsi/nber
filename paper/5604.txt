Introduction

There is now considerable evidence that the cross-sectional pattern

of stock returns can be

explained by characteristics such as size, leverage, pmt returns, dividend-yield, earnings-tcprice
ratios and book- t~market ratios.l Fama and French (1992, 1996) examine all of these variables
simultaneously and conclude that, with the exception of the momentum strategy described by
Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), the cross-sectional variation in expected returns can be explained
by only two of these characteristics, size and book-tomtiket.

Beta, the traditional CAPM

measure of risk, explains almost none of the cross-sectional dispersion in expected returns once
size is

taken into account.2

There is considerable disagreement about the reason for the high discount rate assigned
to small and high book-tomarket

firms. The traditional explanation for these observations,

exposited by Fama and French (1993, 1996), is that the higher returns are compensation for
higher systematic risk. Fama and French (1993) suggest that book-to-market and size are proxies
for distress and that distressed firms may be more sensitive to certain business cycle factors,
like changes in credit conditions, than firms that are financially less vulnerable.

In addition,

the duration of high growth firms’ earnings should be’ somewhat longer than the duration of
the earnings of low growth firms, therefore term structure shifts should affect the two groups of
firms differently.
,,

In contrast, Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994) (LSV) suggest that the high returns
associated with high book-to-market (or value) stocks are generated by investors who incorrectly
extrapolate the past earnings growth rates of firms.

They suggest that investors are overly

optimistic about firms which have done well in the past and are overly pessimistic about those
which have done poorly. LSV also suggest that low book-to-market

(or growth) stocks are more

glamorous than value stocks and may thus attract naive investors who push up prices and lower
the expected returns of these securities.3
1The size anomaly was documented
by Banz (1981) and Keim (1983), leverage by Bhandari (1988),
the past returns effect by DeBondt and Thaler (1985) and Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), the earningsto-price ratio by Ba.su (1983), the book-to-market
effect by Stattman
(1980) and Rosenberg, Reid, and
Lanstein (1985).
2See also Jegadeesh (1992),
3There is also a third potential explanation:
Kothari, Shanken, and’ Sloan (1995) suggest that selection-

Fama

and French

(1993) provide several tests that suggest that a firm’s book-to-market ratio

and size are in fact proxies for the firm’s loading on priced risk factors. First, they show that the
prices of high book-t~market

and small size stocks tend to move up and down together in a way

that is suggestive of a common risk factor. Secondly, they find that the loadings on zero cost
factor portfolios formed based on size (a small capitalization portfolio minus large capitalization
portfolio they call SMB) and book-to-market ratios (a high book-to-market portfolio minus a low
book-to-market

portfolio they call HML) along with a value-weighted market portfolio (Mkt)

explain the excess returns of a full set of book-to-market

and size-sorted portfolios.4

While LSV do not dispute the possibility that there may be priced factors associated with
value (or growth) stocks, they argue that the return premia associated with these factor portfolios
are simply too large and their covariances with macro factors are just too low (and in some cases
negative) to be considered compensation for systematic risks LSV present compelling evidence
to support their claim, however their results are not inconsistent with multi-factor models, such
as Merton (1973) and Ross (1976), which allow for priced” factors that are orthogonal to the
overall market return. An explanation for these return anomalies, based for example on Merton
(1973), would require that we find a priced factor that is orthogonal to the market, yet affects

future investment opportunities.
While we would expect that it would be very difficult to verify that the returns associated
with size and book-to-market

portfolios do indeed satisfy the above condition, it is likely to

bias problems in the construction
of book-t~market
portfolios could be another cause of the premium.
However, recent work by Chan, Jegadeesh,
and Lakonishok
(1995) shows that the selection biases are
not large. Further,
Cohen and Polk (1995a) construct
portfolios in a way that completely eliminates
the COMPUSTAT
selection bias and find similar evidence. Finally, Davis (1994) forms book-to-market
sorted portfolios free of selection bias in the 1940-1963 period (out-of-sample
relative to the Fama and
French 1963-1992 sample period) and finds a book-te-market
effect similar in magnitude
to that found
by Fama and French (1992).
4As further evidence, Fama and French (1993) show that Mkt, HML and SMB portfolios formed from
one-half of the CRSP sample of stocks can explain the returns of portfolios formed with stocks from the
other half. In addition, Fama ad Rench (1995) show that the same return factors are present in a firm’s
earnings, and Cohen and Polk (1995a) show that portfolios formed b~ed on individual firm’s covariances
with the SMB and HML factor exhibit the same premia as do the original size and book-to-market sorted

portfolios.
5MacKinlay (1995) makes a similar argument:

He calculates the statistical
distribution
of the ez-ante
Sharpe-ratio
of the mean-vaiance
efficient portfolio from the returns of the Farna and French (1993)
portfolios, and concludes that the likely value of the the Sharpe-ratio
obtainable
is “too-high” to be
explained within the context of efficient-market
theory.

be equally difficult to verify that the returns do not satisfy this condition. To show that these
returns are not a factor in the Merton sense requires that we show that the factor cannot explain
the component of consumption growth which is orthogonal to the market return.

Given the

difficulties associated with linking observed risk premia on the overall market to macro variables
like aggregate consumption, this could be difficult to demonstrate.
In summary, the existing literature does not directly dispute the supposition that the return premia of high book-t~market

and small size stocks can be explained by a factor model;

rather, the debate centers on whether the factors can possibly represent economically relevant
aggregate risk. In contrast, this paper addresses the more fundamental question of whether the
return patterns of characteristic-sorted portfolio

are really consistent with a factor model at

all. Specifically, we ask (1) whether there really are pervasive factors that are directly associated with size and book-t~market;

and (2) whether there are risk premia associated with these

factors. In other words, we directly test whether the high returns of high book-to-market

and

small size stocks can be attributed to their factor loadings.
Our results indicate that (1) there is no discernible separate risk factor associated with high
or low book-to-market (characteristic) firms, and (2) there is no return premium associated with
any of the three factors identified by Fama and French (1993), suggesting that the high returns

related to these portfolios cannot be viewed as compensation for factor risk. To elaborate,
we find that although high book-to-market

stocks do covary strongly with other high book-

to-market stocks, the covariances do not result from there being particular risks associated
with distress, but rather reflect the fact that high book-to-market

firms tend to have similar

properties; e.g., they might be in related lines of business, might be in the same industries or
from the same regions. Specifically, we find that while high book-to-market

stocks do indeed

covary with one another, their covariances were equally strong bejore the firms became distressed.
To determine whether characteristics or covariances determine expected returns we investigate
whether portfolios with similar characteristics, but different loadings on the Fama and French
(1993) factors, have different returns. We find that the answer is no. Once we control for firm
characteristics, expected returns do not appear to be positively related to the loadings on the
market, HML or SMB factors.

3

~

Our results are disturbing in that, like Fama and French (1992), they suggest that traditional
measures of risk do not determine expected returns. In equilibrium asset pricing models the
covariance structure of returns determine expected returns.

Yet we find that variables that

reliably predict the future covmiance structure do not predict future returns. Our results indicate
that high book-to-market

stocks and stocks with low capitalizations have high average returns

whether or not they have the return patterns (i. e., covariances) of other small and high book-tomarket stocks. Similarly, after controlling for size and book-to-market ratios, a common share
that “acts like” a bond (i. e.,, has a low market beta) has the same expected return as other
common shares with high market betas.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we re-examine the return characteristics
of portfolios of stocks sorted on size and book-t~market,

paying particular attention to sea-

sonalities in these returns, something that is important in our later analysis. In Section 3 we
present a simple, purely descriptive, return generating model which provides some structure to
our discussion of the empirical evidence presented in Sections 4 and 5. The model also provides
some insights about why the Fama and ~ench (1993) tests might fail to reject the factor pricing
model when the model is incorrect and why a factor analysis test, like the tests presented in
Roll (1994), might falsely reject a factor pricing model.

In Section 4 we present evidence on

one feature of this model, that there is no additional factor risk associated with high book-tomarket firms. Then in Section 5 we perform a set of empirical tests on another implication of
our descriptive model, showing that, after controlling for firm characteristics, estimated factor
loadings do not explain returns. Section 6 concludes the paper.

A Summary of the Return Patterns of Size and Book-toMarket Sorted Portfolios.

In this section we re-examine the return patterns of size and book-to-market sorted portfolios.
What we show is that there are important interactions between the size and book-to-market
effects and that the return patterns me different in January and non-January months. As we
later discuss, both of these observations play important roles in our research design.
Panel A of Table 1 presents the mean excess returns for the 25 size/book-to-market

sorted

portfolios from Fama and French (1993), over the period 63:07 to 93:12.6 These portfolios are
breed on unconditional sorts using NYSE breakpoints.

Therefore, for example, the small/low

book-t~market

portfolio is that set of firms included on NYSE/AMEX

or NASDAQ which have

book-to-market

ratios in the range of the lowest quintile of NYSE firms and market equity in

the lowest quintile of NYSE firms. All returns presented here are of value-weighted portfolios
which are rebalanced annually, and consequently the results should not be driven by bid-ask
bounce.’
Panel A illustrates the magnitude of the return differential across the portfolios.

First, we

see that the difference in returns between the high book-to-mmket

quintiles and the low book-

to-market quintile of the same size was more than 50 bp/month

over this period (except for

the very largest firms, where the difference is only 19 bp/month).8

Across size quintiles, the

premia for the smallest quintile of firms over the largest is 30-50 bp/month,

except for the low

book-to-market quintile where the difference is only 1 bp/month.
An analysis of these returns suggests that after controlling for book-to-market there is more
of a large firm rather than a small firm anomaly. Although the returns are almost monotonic in
size, there are no significant differences in the returns of the small and medium size firms within
any of the book-to-market groupings. However, the largest quintile of firms do have significantly
lower returns than the rest, with this being especially true for the high book-to-market stocks.g
One implication of this is that a simple linear or log-linem regression of returns on capitalization
and book-to-market

ratios will not adequately characterize observed stock returns. There are

important interaction effects that would be ignored in such a specification.

the mean returns of the same 25 Fama and Bench portfolios, only now separated into January

of firms, high book-to-market stocks exhibit the same 370 January premium over the returns of
low book-to-market

stocks, however, for these stocks, the difference between the high and low

book-to-market portfolio returns has been negative in the other 11 months.l”

A Model of the Return Generating Process

In this section we present three models which clarify the motivation for our empirical tests,
These should be viewed as purely descriptive models that provide a concrete framework for
describing some of the opposing views described in the introduction.

The first model, which

we consider our null hypothesis, is consistent with the views described by Fama and French
(1993, 1994, 1996) where there exists a “distress” factor with a positive risk premium.

The

second model represents an alternative hypothesis in which the factor structure is stable over
time, and expected returns are determined by a firm’s loading on factors with time varying return
premia, In the third model firm characteristics rather than factor loadings determine expected
returns. Extant empirical evidence is consistent with all three models, but in Sections 4 and
5 we will present empirical evidence that is inconsistent with all but the characteristic-based
model.
In addition to motivating our own research design, the models presented in this section
illustrate some possible pitfalls associated with past studies that examine whether loadings on
factor portfolios explain the returns on characteristic-based portfolios.

First, we argue that

empirical studies that form benchmmks based on principal components or any other form of
factor analysis may falsely reject a linear factor pricing model which in fact properly prices
10Davis (1994) finds similar results.
We note also that this is consistent

ratios.

all assets. These arguments apply to the recent study by Roll (1994), which shows that factor
loadings from a principal components analysis fail to explain the book-t~market

effect, as well m

to earlier tests of the arbitrage pricing theory that used factor analysis. 11 In addition, we argue
that research designs which uses the returns of characteristic-based portfolios as independent
variables may fail to reject a fator

pricing model when the model is in fact incorrect.

Such

designs include Fama and French (1993), as well as Chan, Chen, and Hsieh (1985), Jagannathan
and Wang (1996) and Chan and Chen (1991).

Model

3.1

1: The null hypothesis

Our null hypothesis is that returns are generated by the following factor structure:

where 8i,t_l is firm i’s loading on the distress factor, ~D,*at time t. In this factor pricing model,
expected returns are a linear function of all factor loadings:

Here, the book-t~market

ratio of the firm proxies for O,,t-l, the loading on the distress factor.

The premium associated with this distress factor, AD, is positive, meaning that firms which load
on this distress factor (i. e., high book-to-market firms) earn a positive risk premium.
It is also important to note that @i,t-l varyies over time as firms move in and out of distress.
This means that an experiment in which one estimates the factors using a purely statistical
factor analysis, and then determines whether the premia of the high book-to-market

portfolio

can be explained by the loadings on these factors, would give invalid results: since there is no
group of firms that continually loads on the distress factor, the factor cannot be extracted with
a purely statistical factor analysis.12
11These would include papers by Lehmann and Modest (1988) and Connor and Korajczyk (1988) which
use size-sorted portfolios as independent
variables, but form factors based on individual firm returns.

Model

2: A Model

with Time Varying

Factor Risk Premia

Our first alternative hypothesis is a model in which there is no separate distress factor and in
which the covariance matrix of returns is stable over time. This means that factor loadings do
not change as firms become distressed.

However, since distressed firms on average have high

loadings on factors which have had negative realizations in the past, it appems as if a distress
factor exists. For example, following a string of negative realizations on the oil factor, a portfolio
of high book-t~market

firms will contain a large number of oil stocks. As econometricians, we

would identify movements in the oil factor at this point as movements in the distress factor,
when in fact they are movements in the “distressed” oil factor.
In Model 2, a factor’s risk premium increases following a string of negative factor realizations.
Since many of the firms in the high book-to-market portfolio load on the distressed factor, the
high book-to-market portfolio will have higher expected returns. In the example from the last
paragraph, a portfolio of high book-to-market firms would earn a high return because it contains
many oil firms, which load on the “distressed” oil factor, which now has a high return premium.
More formally, we assume that a time-invariant, J-factor model describes the variancecovariance matrix of returns.

The difference between this equation and equation (1) is that there is no separate distress factor
~~. Furthermore, we assume that the remaining ~’s in this model are constant over time, so
that the covariance structure does not change w firms move in and out of distress. Again, the
factor structure describes expected returns:
J

E[?;,t]= Tf,t

+ ~

Pi,jAj,t-l

(3)

j=l

Now, however, unlike in equation (2), the risk premia on the J factors vary through time. Also,
the changes in the premia are negatively correlated with the pa,st performance of the firms
loading on this factor.

This means that when a factor experiences negative realizations, the

firms that load on the factor become distressed (their book-to-market ratios increase) and their
expected returns increase because the A associated with this factor increases.

8

Finally, we again assume that there is an observable variable di,i (i. e., the book-to-market
ratio). 0 obeys a slowly mean-reverting process and the innovations in 6’are negatively correlated
with past returns (so that distressed firms have high 0’s). This means that, across firms, 8 should
be correlated with the factor loading on the currently distressed factor. Therefore, if a portfolio
of the stocks of high 6 firms is assembled, the stocks are likely to be those which have high
loadings on factors with (currently) high A’s. In other words, the high 8 portfolio is successfully
timing the factors. This characterization is similar to that proposed by Jagannathan and Wang
(1996), who suggest that small firms have high average returns because they have high betas on
the market when the expected return on the market is high.13

3.3

Model

3: A Characteristic-Based

Pricing

Model

In contrast to the factor pricing models presented in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, the characteristicbased model presented in this section assumes that high book-to-market stocks realize a return
premium that is unrelated to the underlying covariance structure. This model is thus inconsistent
with Merton (1973) or Ross (1976) in that it permits asymptotic arbitrage.
As in Model 2, covariances are stationary over time and can be described by a factor
structure 14 Specifically, we again assume that a time-invariant, approximate J-factor structure describes the variance-covariance matrix of returns.

However, in contr=t

to the previous models, factor loadings do not describe expected returns.

Instead, we assume expected returns are a function of the observable, slowly varying firm attribute ~i,t:
(5)
As in Model

2, the innovations

in 6 are negatively

correlated

with the returns on the stock, but

0 is not directly related to the loadings on the distressed factors. What is unique about Model 3
13However the setting here is slightly different: In the Jagannathan
and Wang (1996) setting, the
loadings of tie individual
(small) firms on the market factor change through time, while in the model
presented here, factor loadings are constant but the composition of the high book-to-market
firms changes
over time.
14Although we focus on the relation between book-to-market
ratios and returns in this section, the
analysis also applies to the relation between size and returns.

.

is that firms exist which load on the distressed factors but which me not themselves distressed,

and therefore have a low 0 and commensurately low return (and vice-versa). If Model 3 is true
then following a string of negative shocks to the oil factor there may be some stocks which,
despite their high loadings on the oil factor, are still not distressed. Model 2 suggests these
firms should still e=n the distress premium, because they behave like other distressed firms. In
contrmt, Model 3 suggests their returns behavior does not’ matter: if they are not distressed
they will not earn the premium. Note also that Model 3 implies that a clever investor can earn

Empirical

return premium without loading on any common factors.

Implications

of the Models

The empirical evidence that Fama and French (1993) present can be summarized with two
empirical facts: (1) the stocks in the high book-t~market
another; and (2) high book-to-market

portfolio strongly covary with one

stocks have high returns. The conclusion conventionally

drawn from this evidence is that the firms in the high book-to-market portfolio are all loading
on a factor which has a high premium; this is indeed the intuition suggested by the first two
models.
Models 2 and 3 illustrate why this conclusion need notfollow from the evidence. It is true that
since the distressed firms covary with one another, on average these firms must load on the same
factor, which we can call the distressed factor. Of course, a firm will become distressed when a
factor on which it loads has a strong negative realization. Using Bayesian reasoning, it therefore
follows that firms which are distressed will, on average, load on the same factor. In both Model 2
and 3 “(the characteristic-based model), this is why distressed firms covary with one another, not
because of the presence of a separate distress factor. One way to discriminate between Model
1 and Models 2 and 3 is to see whether the return standard deviation of a portfolio of stocks
increase if they all simultaneously become distressed. If the factor structure is stable and there
is no separate distress factor (i. e., if Model 1 is false), then the return standard deviation should
stay approximately constant.
Model 3 also indicates these existing empirical observations do not necessarily imply that
returns are determined by factor loadings. In the characterist it-based model, the high returns
are earned by all distressed firms, whether they load on the distressed factor or not. Some firms

10

may have become distressed by virtue of bad realizations on an idiosyncratic

on a common factor.

term rather

than

Models 1 and 2 predict that such firms should not exhibit a premium;

however, if the characteristic-based

model is correct they should.

In tests where the test portfolio returns are constructed

from characteristic sorted portfolios

(as in Fama and French (1993)), the factor will appmr to. be associated with a high premium:
since the average firm in the distressed portfolio does load on this factor, a strong correlation
will be found between distressed factor loadings and return premia.

Hence, to discriminate

between the models, a test method must be used which separates out the firms which are high
book-to-market, but which do not behave like high book-to-market firms. This is what our test
in Section 5 does.
The stability of the covariance matrix turns out to be quite important for testing the pricing
aspect of the characteristics-breed model. If the factor structure is reasonably stable, we can
use past factor loadings to predict future loadings and determine whether it is characteristics
or factor loadings which determine returns. However, if the covariance matrix is unstable, it
will be difficult to determine how firms will behave in the future, and consequently to find, for
example, value firms which behave more like growth firms.

A

The Covariation of Stocks with Similar Characteristics

The characteristics-pricing model described in Section 3.3 differs from our null hypothesis as
presented in Section 3.1 in two important ways. First, the characteristics model has no “distress”
factor; the common variation in high book-t-market

stocks arises because stocks with similar

factor loadings are likely to become distressed at the same time. Second, the model specifies
that average returns are determined by characteristics like book-to-market and size rather than
factor loadings.
The first aspect of the model is important because the common variation among value and
growth stocks has been interpreted as evidence of a distress factor. This is b=ed on the following
reasoning: if you randomly select 1000 stocks and go long a dollar in each of these, and randomly
select 1000 stocks and go short a dollar in each of these, the resulting portfolio will effectively net
out the various sources of factor risk and you should end up with a portfolio with an extremely

11

small return variance. Assuming that the residual standard deviation of the individual stocks
is roughly 1070/month, then the standard deviation of this random portfolio’s returns would be
about 0.25Ye/month. Instead, the HML portfolio has a standard deviation of about 2.5Y0/month
indicating that the portfolio is subject to considerable factor risk. Farna and French (1993)
interpret this evidence in the following way:
constructed. to mimic risk factors related to size and BE/ME
capture
strong common variation in returns, no matter what else is in the time series regression. This is evidence that size and book-to-market equity indeed proxy for sensitivity
to common risk factors in stock returns.
. . . portfolios

In contrast, the characteristics model assumes that this common variation arises because the
HML portfolio consists of “similar” firms that have similar factor loadings whether
are distressed.

or not they

In other words, the return generating model is assumed to be reasonably stable,

but firms with similar factor loadings are expected to be distressed at the same time.

Portfolio

Returns

In this section we examine how the risk chmacteristics of stocks change in the years leading

up to their inclusion in the various characteristic portfolios.

If Model 1 provides a good char-

acterization of the data, then on average, the covmiances between the stocks should be higher
when they are in the high book-t~market

portfolio than when they are not. However, under

the specifications in Models 2 and 3, covariances are constant over time.
Following Fama and French (1993), we form six portfolios based on the intersection of the

16Note that this gives us slightly different returns over the period July:t through June:(t + 1) than for the
standard HML portfolio; we are holding the weights constant here so we are not generating buy-and-hold
returns. Elsewhere in the paper we calculate true buy-and-hold
returns.

12

Before looking at pre- and post- formation date standard deviations we will examine the
average returns of stocks included in the HML portfolios prior to the formation date.

We

calculate these average pre-formation returns for the entire set of formation dates from June
1963 through June 1990 (28 years), and plot these in Figure 1. We stop in 1990 because this

is the last formation date for which six years of future return data is available. This figure
shows that the pre-formation returns of the HML portfolio are strongly negative, supporting
the contention of Fama and French that high book-t~market

firms are distressed and that low

book-to-market firms have performed well in the past. Another important

feature of this plot is

the large returns experienced in every January in the pre-formation period. Every pre-formation
(average) return outside of January is negative and every average January return is positive.
Note also that there is a large “step” in the returns in January of the formation year. This is
because the portfolios are formed based on the book-t~market

ratios at the end of the preceding

year, as described earlier.
To determine how covariances change in the pre- and post- formation period we examine the
pre- and post-formation return standard deviations of the eight portfolios.

One difficulty with

this analysis is that a considerable fraction of the firms in the HML portfolio are not traded
five years before or five years after the portfolio formation date.

For example, about half of

the small growth stocks (L/S portfolio) do not have CRSP or COMPUSTAT
prior to their inclusion in the portfolio.

data five years

Similarly, about 25% of the H/S firms do not have

data five years subsequent to their inclusion. Therefore, to generate this table, we have also
imposed the additional requirement that, for a firm to be included in the analysis, it must have
returns reported on CRSP in June: (t-5) for the Backward Looking Analysis (where June:t is the
formation date), and at June: (t+5) for the forward looking analysis. Without this restriction,
the formation-year 5 and -5 portfolios would contain a substantially smaller number of firms
than the lag O portfolios.17
These standard deviations are presented in Table 2. First, consider the leftmost column
in Panel A, labeled with formation-year 5. The numbers in this column are the excess return
standard deviations for the portfolio formed based on the characteristics five years in the future.
For example, the portfolio’s composition between July of 1963 and June of 1964 is based on

firm sizes at the end of June 1968 and book-t~m~ket

ratios at the end of December of 1967.

This column provides the standard deviation of the portfolios five years prior to their actual
formation dates.
Because of data restrictions we investigate only the 63:07-89:06 period for the “Backward
Looking” portfolios: reforming the formation-year 5 portfolio in 89:07 would require stock prices
for June of 1994, which we do not currently have access to, For the “Forward Looking” Analysis
in the right side of the Table we use the sample period from through 68:07-93:12 because bookto-market ratios are not available before December 1962. We calculate the standard deviations
of each of these 54 series (six lagged years times nine portfolios) for each lag and tabulate these
in Panel A of Table 2. We see that the difference in the lags + 5 and lag Ostandard deviations is
close to zero for all series except the HML, for which the standard deviations increase from 2.2
to 2.5. However, part of the increase in standard deviation for the HML portfolio arises because
it exhibits a large January seasonal, as we saw in Figure 1. In Panel B of Table 2 we perform
the same standard deviation calculation, only we now exclude all Januarys from the sample.
There is still a slight increme in standard deviation in moving from formation-year 5 to O, (and
a decrease in moving from formation-year -5 to O) but this increase is only about 10Yo.18
In summary, the reason that high book-t~market

stocks exhibit strong common variation is

not because they load on a separate distress factor. If this were the case, this common variation
would disappear when we look prior to and after the time when these firms are most distressed.
We instead find that the common variation is present both five years before and after these firms
are in the distress/growth portfolio. This suggests that the common variation is always present
for the set of H and L firms, and is not a result of loading on a separate factor that is present
only when they are in a distress/growth phase. 19
lsWe note that the HML portfolio returns exhibit high standard deviations at -1 and -2 years, Recall
that these portfolios are formed based on ex-post information that they will (on-average) experience

large positive (for the H portfolios) or negative returns (for the L portfolios) in formation-years 1 and
2. Perhaps this contributes to the high standard deviations. Notice that there is no such effect for the
formation-year – 1 and –2 portfolios, which are formed based on ex-ante information.
lgWe considered the possibility that the returns standard
deviations
change very little because the
book-t~market
ratios of the six portfolios change very little. However, we calculate the average bookto-market ratio for the six portfolios in the table, and show that they do change significantly (these data
are available upon request). In addition, we regressed the time series of returns in Panel A of Table 2 on
the three Fama/French
factor-mimicking
portfolios.
For the HML portfolio, the ~HML coefficient falls
substantially
in moving from O lags to either +5 or -5. The coefficient is 0.46 for formation year 5, and

Cross-Sectional

Tests of the Factor Model

If a factor pricing model is correct, then a high book-t~market

stock with a low book-t~market

factor loading should have a low average return, In contrast, if prices are based on characteristics
rather than on factor loadings, then a high book-to-market stock should have a high expected
return regardless of its loading.

This Section presents tests of the two factor pricing models

(Models 1 and 2) against the characteristic-breed alternative (Model 3).
As discussed in Section 3.4, discriminating between these models requires portfolios that
exhibit low correlation between their factor loadings and their characteristics (e.g., high bookto-market ratios but low loadings on the HML factor). In order to construct such portfolios we
first form portfolios based on characteristics (size and book-to-market),

and then sort each of

these into sub-portfolios based on the firms’ pre-formation factor loadings. In this respect, our
analysis is very similar to the analysis in Fama and ~ench

(1992) and Jegadeesh (1992) who

construct portfolios that exhibit independent variation in size and beta. As in these papers, we
then analyze whether the returns for the sub-portfolios vary with the factor loading, as Models
1 and 2 predict they should.

5.1

Construction

Test

Portfolios

We first rank all NYSE firms by their book-to-market

ratio at the end of year t – 1 and their

market capitalization (ME) at the end of June of year t, as described in the Appendix. We form
33.3% and 66.6% breakpoints for book-to-market and ME based on these rankings. Starting in
July of year t, we then place all NYSE/AMEX

and NASDAQ stocks into the three book-to-

market groups and the three size groups based on these breakpoints. The firms remain in these
portfolios from July of year t to June of year t + 1.
The stocks in each of these nine portfolios are then placed into smaller portfolios, b~ed on
the stocks’ expected future HML factor loading, using information that is ez-ante observable.
The resulting sets of portfolios consist of stocks with approximately the same size and book-tomarket ratios but with different loadings on the book-t~market

factor HML. These portfolios

0.36 for formation year –5, versus a coefficient of approximately
1 at lag O. This demonstrates
that the
high standard deviation of the lead or lagged HML portfolio returns cannot be attributed
to comovement
with the current set of value/growth
firms.

We use the stocks’ pre-fomation

factor loadings as instruments for their future expected

loadings. To estimate these, we regress each stock’s returns on three pre-fomation

factor port-

folios (described in the next paragraph) for the period -42 to -7 relative to the portfolio formation
date. We did not use the month -6 to O observations to estimate these loadings because the factor portfolios are formed based on stock prices existing 6 months previously. This is illustrated
in Figure 1. From this plot, it can be seen that returns are very negative up to t = –6, when the
book-to-market ratios are calculated. However, the portfolio returns are large between t = –6
and t = – 1. This “step function” in the return pattern would add noise to our factor loading
estimates, so we exclude it from our estimation period.
The factor portfolios used to calculate the pre-formation
and French factor portfolios in an important respect.

factor loadings differ from the Fama

The Fama and French factor portfolio

weights change every year as firm size and book-t~market

change.

What we do is take the

portfolio weights of the Fama and French factor portfolios at the end of June of year t and
apply these constant weights to returns from date -42 to -7 to calculate the returns of constant
weight factor portfolios, as described in Section 4.1. Based on our hypothesis that the covariance
matrix is stationary over time, factor loadings calculated from factor portfolios constructed in
this way should provide much better predictions of the future covariance of firms with the HML
factor.

As our evidence in the last section indicates, covariances between stocks entering the

high book-to-market portfolio seem relatively stable.20
Breed on these ez-ante estimates of the factor loadings we then equally divide each of the
nine book-to-market and size sorted portfolios into five value-weighted portfolios. Unfortunately,
several of the 45 portfolios formed in this way have as few as 1 stock in them for the years between
1963 and 1973. As a result we must restrict our time-series tests to the 1973-1993 period; the
number of stocks in each portfolio is almost always above 10, and is generally much higher than
this after 1973.
20As further evidence on this point, we also constructed
portfolios by sorting stocks based on their
covariances with past HML returns.
The dispersion in post-jomation
factor loadings across portfolios
formed in this way was substantially
smaller than the dispersion in ex-post factor loadings of portfolios
constructed
in the manner described above,

5.2

Empirical

Results

Table 3 presents the mean excess returns for the 45 portfolios described in the previous section.
As we move from column 1 to 5 in this table we me moving from portfolios with low ez-ante
loadings on the HML factor to portfolios with high loadings. The table reveals no discernible
relation between factor loadings and returns for the portfolios of smaller stocks but a relatively
weak positive relation between the factor loadings and returns for the portfolios comprised of
larger stocks; however, the difference between the average returns of first and fifth factor loading
portfolios is only 0.0770/month.

Moreover, it is possible that this weak positive relation occurs

because, in sorting on the HML factor loading, we are picking up variation in the book-to-market
ratio within the relatively broad categories.
We examine this possibility in Table 4 which provides the average book to market ratios and
sizes of each of the 45 portfolios. The average book to market ratios and sizes reported for each
portfolio are calculated relative to the median NYSE firm at each formation date. What we
find is that across factor-loading portfolios, within any book-to-market/size

grouping, there is

some covariation between the average book-to-market ratio and the HML factor loading. And
indeed, this pattern is strongest for the large firm (Sz = 3) portfolios, which is also where we see
the strongest positive relation between factor loadings and returns. 21 This factor/characteristic
covariation will decre~e the power of our test to reject the factor model (Model 1) in favor of
the characteristics model (Model 3), however we will see later that the test is still adequately
powerful to reject the null hypothesis.

The lack of a relation between the loadings and the

returns could potentially reflect the fact that pre-~ormation betas are weak predictors of future
(or post-jormation) loadings. However, the results reported in Table 5 indicate that our method
does in fact achieve considerable dispersion in the post-formation factor loadings. In Table 5,
we report the results of regressing the posi-jormation excess returns for each of the 45 portfolios
on an intercept and on the returns of the zero-investment Mkt, HML and SMB portfolios.
We see in Table 5 that the HML coefficients are clearly different for the different book-to21Mean size is roughly constant acrossthe factor loading portfolios. The only regularpattern is that the
more extreme factor loading portfolios (portfolios 1 and 5) tend to be slightly smaller, This is probably
because smaller stocks have higher return standard deviations,
firms are likely to be more extreme than for the larger firms.

HML factor loadings produces a
Moreover, there appears to be a

highly significant difference between the loadings of the low and high factor-loading portfohos,
something we shall verify shortly.22
We are especially interested in the estimated intercepts. Models 1 and 2 predict that the
regression intercepts (a’s) should be zero, while model 3 suggests that the mean returns of
the portfolios should depend only on characteristics (size and book-to-market),

and should be

independent of variation in the factor loadings. Hence, Model 3 also predicts that the a’s of
the low factor-loading portfolios should be positive and that those of the high-factor loading
portfolios should be negative. The a’s reported in this table indicate that this is generally the
case. Only one of the nine high loading portfolios (see column 5) has a positive a and only
two of the low loading portfolios (see column 1) has a negative a. Furthermore, the average
a for factor loading portfolio 1 is 0.02% per month, and for factor loading portfolio 5 it is
–0.24%/month.

The difference is -0.26%/month.

Recall that Table 3 showed that the difference

in average returns for these portfolios was only 0.07%/month.
In Table 6 we formally test whether the a’s associated with the high and low factor loadings

are significantly different from each other.

To do this we calculate the returns to portfolios

which, for each of the nine book-to-market

and size groupings, invests one dollar in each of

the factor loading portfolios 1 and 2 and sells one dollar in each of factor loading portfolios
4 and 5.

We call these “characteristic-balanced”

portfolios, since both the long and short

positions in the portfolios are constructed to have approximately equal book-to-market

ratios

and capitalizations. Each of these nine zero cost portfolios are then combined to form one zero
cost characteristic-balanced portfolio.23
The characteristic-based model predicts that the average return from these zero cost characteristic22We note that the dispersion in pre-fomation factor-loadings

balanced portfolios should be indistinguishable from zero. In addition, the characteristic-based
model predicts that the estimated intercept from a regression of the returns of these zero cost
portfolio on the Fama and French factor portfolios should be positive. In contrast, the factor
pricing models described in models 1 and 2 predict that the average returns should differ from
zero, but that the intercept from the factor model should be indistinguishable from zero.
The results reported in Table 6 reveals

that all but one of the a’s from the time-series

regressions of the nine individual characteristic-balanced portfolio returns on the factor returns

In contrast, the mean return of this portfolio is only –0.116% per month (T-Statistic of -0.60),
which is only one-third of the size of the factor model intercept, and is insignificantly different
from zero.

These results are consistent with the characteristic-bwed

pricing model and are

inconsistent with the factor pricing models (Models 1 and 2).

5.3

Sorting

by Other

Factor Loadings

This section presents similar tests that allow us to determine whether the SMB and MKT jactors
are priced, after controlling for size and book-t~market

characteristics. Table 7 presents the

mean returns, coefficients on the SMB factor, the intercepts and associated T-statistics for a set
of portfolios constructed in the manner described in the last section, except that now the nine
portfolios are each sorted into quintiles based on the pre-formation SMB factor loadings, rather
than on the HML factor loadings. It can be seen in the SMB betas that our sorting method is
picking up dispersion in the SMB factor loadings within the size sorted portfolios.
The lower right panel of Table 7 provides the T-statistics for the regression of the characteristicbalanced portfolio returns on the three factors. Again, the characteristic-balanced portfolio returns are the differences in returns between the two lowest factor loading portfolios (in columns
1 and 2 of the upper panels) and the two highest factor loading portfolios (in columns 4 and 5),
24The intercept,

is constructed

that the characteristic matters and not the factor loading.

In other words a stock earns the

“stock” premium even if its return pattern is similar to that of a bond (i. e., it has a low ~~~t ).
These results are similar to the results reported by Fama and French (1992) and Jegadeesh
(1992) who show that, after controlling for size, there is a slightly negative relationship with
beta.25 We also see from the last row of the Table that the three-factor model is rejected for
this portfolio with a T-statistic of 2.2.

and Past

Returns

The fact that there are stocks with similar capitalizations and book to market ratios but very
different factor loadings deserves further analysis. We do not find this surprising, given that
firms in very different industries can be very similar along these two dimensions. However, we
would like to know if these differences in factor loadings are significantly related to either volume
or returns in the recent past since there is evidence suggesting that momentum (Jegadeesh and
Titman 1993) and liquidity (Amihud and Mendelson 1986) can be important predictors of stock

One possibility is that the low factor loading stocks are the less liquid stocks, (Perhaps, the
factor loadings of the less liquid stocks me underestimated because their returns lag the returns
of the more liquid stocks in the factor portfolios. ) If this were the case, and if in addition there
was a liquidity premium, then one might expect the lower expected returns associated with
having a lower factor loading would be offset by the return premia ~sociated

with illiquidity.

Similarly, we might expect that the low factor loading stocks are those that did very poorly
over the previous year and just recently entered the high book to market portfolio.

However,

this would bias our tests towards supporting the factor model since the momentum effect would
lower the returns of these low loading stocks. In order to bias our results against the factor
model the past years returns of the stocks must be negatively related to the factor loading.
To explore these possibilities we calculated the average turnover and the average return over
the 12 pre-formation months for each of the 45 portfolios. These are tabulated in Tables 9 and
10. The findings reported in this table suggests that our lack of support for a factor model is not
due to either momentum or liquidity. Indeed, the portfolios with the lowest factor loadings seem
to have the highest turnover, suggesting that if liquidity does have an effect on returns, it would
bias our results towards finding a relation between factor loadings and returns. In addition,
there does not seem to be any noticeable relation between p~t returns and factor loadings.

The

Conclusions
analysis in this paper demonstrates two things: First, we show that there is no evidence of

a separate distress factor. Most of the comovement of high book-t~market

stocks is not due to

distressed stocks being exposed to a unique “distress” factor, but rather, because stocks with
similar factor sensitivities tend to become distressed at the same time. Second, our evidence
suggests that it is characteristics rather than factor loadings that determine expected returns.
We show that factor loadings do not explain the high returns ~sociated

with small and high

book-to-market stocks beyond the extent to which they act as proxies for these characteristics.
Further, our results show that, with equities, the market beta has no explanatory power for
returns even after controlling for size and book-t~market

21

ratios. Although our analysis focused

on the factor portfolios suggested by Fama and French (1993), we conjecture that factor loadings
memured with respect to the various macro factors used by Chan, Chen, and Hsieh (1985), Chen,
Roll, and Ross (1986) and Jagannathan and Wang (1996) will also fail to explain stock returns
once characteristics are tden
book-tc-market-sorted

into account.

These papers explain the returns of size and/or

portfolios and are thus subject to our criticism of the Fama and French

(1993) analysis.
Some of our colleagues have argued that although we have shown that the Fama and French
factors are inefficient, we have not refuted the more general claim that the size and book-tomarket effects can be explained by a factor model. 26 This argument is based on the idea that the
HML portfolio contains noise as well as factor risk. If this is true and if the book-to-market ratio
is a very good proxy for the priced factor loading, then ~HML may provide almost no additional
information

on the

true

factor

loading,

after

controlling

for the

book-to-market

ratio.

Under

these assumptions, in sorting on factor loading as we do in Table 5, we are picking out variation
in the measured ~~~~’s which is not associated with variation in the priced factor loading, and
hence we cannot expect returns to vary with ~~~~.
While we certainly cannot rule out the possibility that factor model can explain this data,
we still find this argument unconvincing for several reasons. First, the argument suggests that
if the models are estimated with less noisy factors, we are less likely to reject the factor model.
However, more recent evidence suggest that this is not the cme. Cohen and Polk (1995b) and
~ankel and Lee (1995) show that refined measures of the book-to-mmket

More importantly, Cohen and Polk show that when they replicate our cross-sectional test (in
Table 5) with their more efficient industry-adjusted

HML factor,27 they find that the factor

model is still rejected in favor of our characteristics model .26
26WTe
think Kenneth ~ench for bringing this possibility
y tOour attention.
“More efficient here means that it has a higher Sharpe ratio.
28Specifically,Cohen and Polk (1995b) calculate adjustedbook-to-market ratios based on the ratio of
individual firm’s ratio to the long-run average book-to-market ratio for the the industry the firm is in.
They construct an HML portfolio based on this measureand find that it has a considerablyhigherSharperatio than the Farnaand French (1993) HML portfolio (and is therefore more efficient). They redo the
tests presented here with the more efficient portfolios and find that the factor model is still rejected in
favor of the characteristic-basedmodel.

22

In addition, if the excess returns of distressed stocks do arise because of their sensitivity to
an unobserved factor, it must be the case that the unobserved factor portfolios have significantly
higher Sharpe ratios than not only the FF portfolios but also the more efficient portfolios of
Cohen and Polk and Frankel and Lee. In other words, the payoff associated with bearing the
risks associated with these distressed factors must be significantly greater than the payoff from
holding the size and book-to-market factor portfolios. MacKinlay (1995) has suggested that the
Sharpe ratio achievable using the three Fama and French (1993) factor portfolios is already “too
large” to be explained by efficient market theories; would explain the returns of the portfolios
in Table 5 would have still higher Sharpe ratios.
If expected returns are indeed based on characteristics rather risk, the implications for portfolio analysis, performance evaluation and corporate finance are striking. As we have already
discussed, our results suggest that portfolios can be constructed which earn the book-to-market
premium without loading heavily on common factors.

This means that higher Sharpe ratios

are achievable than was indicated by previous studies. In terms of performance evaluation,. our
results suggest that comparing the evaluated returns to matched samples formed on the basis of
capitalization, book-to-market and probably also past returns (to account for the Jegadeesh and
Titman (1993) momentum effect) would be preferred to using the intercepts from regressions on
factor portfolios. A recent example of the matched sample approach is Ikenberry, Lakonishok,
and Vermaelen (1995). We are substantially more tentative about the implications of our results
for corporate finance. It should be noted, however, that the characteristics model is inconsistent
with the Modigliani and Miller (1958) theorem, so if we do want to take the characteristic-based
pricing model seriously, we will have to rethink most of what we know about corporate finance.
However, before beginning to consider the implications of these results, it is worthwhile to
consider why it might be that characteristics are the determinants of returns rather than risk.
Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994) suggest a behavioral explanation: that investors may
incorrectly extrapolate past growth rates. Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1992) suggest an
agency explanation: that investment fund managers are aware of the expected returns associated
with value stocks, but nonetheless purchase growth stocks because these are easier to justify to
sponsors. Liquidity-based explanations may also be plausible, since volume tends to be related
to size and past returns, but the evidence in Table 9 suggests that the relationship between

23

book-to-market and turnover is relatively weak.
Another possibility is that investors consistently held priors that size and book-t~market
ratios were proxies for systematic risk and, as a result, attached higher discount rates to stocks
with these characteristics. For example, they may have believed that stocks with these characteristics would be more sensitive to aggregate economic or credit conditions, beliefs that many
financial economists shared. With the benefit of hindsight we can now say that book-to-market
ratios do not seem to be particularly good proxies for systematic risk of this sort. However, we
think it is quite plausible that investors in the 1960s and 1970s, with limited ability to access
and manipulate the returns/accounting

data that would have told them otherwise, would not

have updated their priors as our statistical analysis suggests they should have. If this is the case
than the patterns we have observed in the data should not be repeated in the future.

Appendix:

Construction of the Portfolios

The construction of the book-t~market and size portfolios follows Fama and French (1993).
Using the merged CRSP/COMPUSTAT
files maintained by CRSP we form portfolios of common
shares based on the ratio of the book-equity to market equity (book-to-market) and on market
equity (ME). B is defined to be stockholder’s equity plus any deferred taxes and any investment
tax credit, minus the value of any preferred stock, all from COMPUSTAT. To determine the
value of preferred stock we use redemption value if this is available, otherwise we use liquidating
value if it is available, and if not we use carrying value. In calculating book-to-market, we use
the book-equity from any point in year t, and the market on the last trading day in year t,
where the market equity, from CRSP, is defined as the number of shares outstanding times the
share price. We only include firms in our analysis which have been listed on COMPUSTAT for
at least two years and which have prices available on CRSP in both December of t and June of
year t + 1. The book-to-market ratios, and sizes of the firms thus determined are then used to
form the portfolios from July oft + 1 to June of t + 2. As discussed in Fama and ~ench (1993),
the end of June is used as the portfolio formation date because the annual report containing the
book-equity value for the preceding year is virtually certain to be public information by that
time.
To form the portfolio, we first exclude from the sample all firms with book-to-market values
of less than zero. We take all NYSE stocks in the sample and rank them on their bookto-market and size as described above. Based on these rankings, we calculate 30% and 70%
breakpoints for book-to-market and a 50% breakpoint for size. We then place all NYSE/AMEX
and NASDAQ stocks into the three book-to-market groups and the two size groups based on
these breakpoints. The stocks above the 70% book-to-market breakpoint are designated H, the
middle 40% of firms are designated M, and the firms below the 3070 book-to-market breakpoint
are designated L. Also firms above the 5070 size breakpoint are designated B (for big), and the
remaining 50% S (for small). Note that since these breakpoints are based only on NYSE firms,
we have considerable variation in the number of firms in each of the nine portfolios formed in
this way. For example, since there are many more small firms on NASDAQ and AMEX the
number of firms in the small firm portfolios is much larger than the number of firms in the large
firm portfolios.
These two sets of rankings allow us to form the six value-weighted portfolios HB, MB, LB,
HS, MS, and LS. From these portfolio returns we calculate the SMB(Small-Minus-Big) portfolio
returns, which are defined to be rSMB = (rHs + rMS + rL,S– rHB – rMB – rLB)/3, and the HML
(Mgh-Minus-Low) pOrtfOliOretUrnS, which are defined as rH~L = (rHE + r~s - rL~ - ~L.5)/2.
Also, a value-weighted portfolio Mkt is formed which contains all of the firms in these portfolios,
plus the otherwise excluded firms with book-t~market values of less than zero.

monthly return standard deviations of portfolios
This table presentspre-formation characteristicsof the set of size and book-to-market portfolios.
Six portfolios were formed b~ed on unconditional sorts on book-t~market (H, M, and L) and size (S
and B). Mkt, SMB, HML portfolios were also formed as described in the Appendix. For this table, we
also imposed the additional requirementthat CRSP report a valid return for the firm five years (prior
to/after) to the formation for the (forward/backward) looking malysis.
The formation year Oreturns consistsof returnsfrom July of year t through June of year t + 1 for valueweighted portfolios reformed each year at the end of June of year t,based on the BM at the end of year
t – 1 and the market value in June oft. These returns are approximatelyequivalentto those presentedin
Fama and French (1993). For formation years (FY) other than zero, the portfolio time seriesof returns
consists again of the returns from July of year t through June of year t + 1, but now formed based on
the BM at the end of year t – 1 + FY and the market value in June of t + FY. The portfolio weights in
these calculations
are based on the market value in June oft+ FY.
Panel A presents the simple time-series standard deviations of each of these portfolios. For the backward
looking portfolios, for each of the six lags, the return time series is from 63:07 to 89:06. For the forwardlooking-. portfolios, the time period is 68:07-93:12. Panel B also presents the time-series standard deviations
the portfolios, but here the January returns are excluded from each of the time series.

We first rank all NYSE firms by their book-to-market

We form 33.3% and 66.7%
breakpoints
for book-to-market

Starting in July of year t, we then
place all NYSE/AMEX

The firms remain in these portfolios from the beginning of July of

The regression is run between 42 months ad 6 months prior to the formation date (June of year t),as is
described in Section 5.1, The value-weighted
returns for each of these portfolios are then calculated for
each month between July 1973 and December 1993. The formation process results in portfolios which

The regressions are over the period July 1973 to December 1993.
The left hand side portfolios were formed based on size, book-to-market
and pre-formation
HML factor
loadings, and their returns were calculated
in the manner described in Table 3. From the resulting
forty-five returns series, a zer~investment
returns series was generated from each of the nine size and
book-to-market
categories.
These portfolios are formed, in each category, by subtracting
the sum of the
returns on the 4th and 5th quintile factor-loading
portfolios from the sum of the returns on 1st and 2nd
factor-loading
portfolios.
