also believe that U.S. firms provide some general training to their workers while
bearing some of the initial outlays, for example in the form of tuition assistance
or as in-house training in general skills (see Osterman

, 1993, for a discussion of

the U.S. evidence).
In order to explain firms’ investments in general skills, some labor market
imperfection must exist so that the mobility of workers is restricted and that,
employers earn rents on trained workers. The mechanism we propose in this paper
is the adverse selection story also analyzed by Waldman

(1984), Greenwald

(1986)

and Gibbons and Katz (1991) among others. The talents and skills of young
workers who arrive in the market are in general unknown.

that raids lead to an extreme form of the winner’s curse which often makes this

Nevertheless,

in the presence of raids there will be a unique

equilibrium with no more training than in the case without poaching.
While our theory, at lemt to us, has obvious appeal, a real test involves deriving
new and different predictions

and confronting them with data. We do this in
the second part of the paper. In particular, we look at the wages of German
apprentices who stay in their firm, who are laid off or quit their firm voluntarily,
and compare them with the wages of apprentices who quit for ezogenous reasons,

workers, which we denote by w(t).

At this point, it may also desire to lay off some

of these workers. 2 However, the firm is aware that some of the workers it wants
to keep will nevertheless leave. The reason for quits is because the workers realize
that they are not getting on with their colleagues or supervisor,

we obtain Becker’s standard model.4

In this case, outside wages of workers who

Thus no firm will

be able to retain its trained workers unless it pays this wage. As a consequence,
the training firm enjoys no rents, and there will be no training unless the worker

Hence the firm’s layoff decision will take a

Since the firm offers W first and then decides how much training to offer and
chooses the retention and wage policies, the problem can then be written as

More voluntary quits imply that the quality of the labor

pool in the secondary market is higher. To see this consider the case in which
q = O. Then all workers who are looking for a job must have been laid off, and
thus they must have a level of ability less than fi. In contrast, when q >0,

Higher outside wages imply that workers who are unhappy can leave more easily,
and as a result voluntary quits are higher.
Therefore, at a given level of training, the equilibrium wages and quit behavior
can be determined as the intersection of two upward sloping curves, hence the
multiplicity.

Also, with higher quits profits due to training are lower because the

firm has a smaller ex post monopsony

to less training in equilibrium.

3.1. Raids

and Discussion

on Trained

Workers

So far we have only allowed outside firms to hire quitters which can be thought of
as passive poaching. The alternative is of course active poaching or raids whereby
a firm makes an offer to a currently employed worker. To analyze these possibilities, we now add more structure to our model.

if all these workers quit, the outside wage would be high, i (t’), and quitting would

This implies that by offering ti(t’) the raider could induce all these

workers to quit, thus the equilibrium with lower training and higher outside wages
would always be selected.

Here we can establish that our previous results do not change in

15

The crucial assumption

we make is that the number of workers each training

firm lays off is observable.

Because the workers who are not laid off will be of

higher quality, quitters will want to wait for the more favorable
rather than be pooled

with the laid off workers.

This implies that there is a

strategic element in the layoff decision of the training firm. By laying off fewer
workers, the training firm can induce raiders to make lower offers. To see this
consider the case where the training firm lays off half of its workers, then outside
firms will deduce that the remaining

workers are all above average ability.

On

the other hand, if the firm does not lay off many workers, then raiding firms will
recognize that they will also attract more of the lemons.
To formalize this intuition consider the following sequence of events. The
apprenticeship firm trains all workers, then offers a unique wage to all workers and
lays off some. These actions are perfectly

The firm can respond

Finally, the workers decide which of these offers to take.
In this case, an equilibrium will take the following form. The training firm
offers a zero wage to all of its workers and lays off none. This strategy has no cost

To reiterate, the basic idea is that the firm is still able to retain some of the
high ability workers, and given Assumption

Our model is related to a number of papers in the literatures on training and on
wage determination in imperfect labor markets. Highlighting the differences will
further clarify our main points. The first strand of the literature is the competitive
models of training. These models start with the seminal work of Becker (1964)
and Mincer (1974).

As we show in the second section, these models are unable to

apprenticeship

and workers who

We do not know whether workers who stay with their

firm served in the military. The model implies the following:

1. Stayers earn more than laid off workers and voluntary quitters. That is
w*(t) > v(t). It is easy to see that this has to be true. If w*(t) < v(t),
stayers would quit even if they did not receive a negative taste shock and
be better off in the second-hand

market.

2. Military quitters leaving for largely exogenous reasons earn more than other
quitters.

That is IJn(t) > v(t).

The reason they earn more than quitters

is that they are of higher average ability and both groups are paid their
average marginal product

in the second-hand

market.

For this to be true

it is not necessary that there is no selection at all among military quitters.
For example,

training firms may want to rehire very high ability military

quitters after they complete

their service.

If there is some cost to doing so

—for instance, in the case that firms need to keep certain positions open for
these workers—,

training firms will be more selective in retaining workers

who have to do military service than other workers. Denote the ability cut
off for military quitters used by the training firm in equilibrium

as fin(t),

then the average quality of the pool of military quitters in the second-hand

The earnings variable on the surveys is the gross monthly wage. Respondents
in the 1979 survey were asked to report their earnings in 13 brackets and in the
1985/86 survey in 22 brackets. We assign each individual earnings equal to the
bracket midpoint. 12 Because of the large number of brackets this is unlikely to

which we assigned a value of DM 17,500 (0.6 percent of sample respondents).

for disability status, and a dummy for workers who are still in their apprenticeship
firm. The last variable is the only one which potentially contains information on
post-apprenticeship
outcomes. It turns out to be relatively unimportant and we
also present results without this variable.
Our main result is that both stayers and military quitters earn higher wages
than those who left their apprenticeship firm for other reasons. Only the coefficient for stayers is significant in the 1985/86 regressions, while the others are not.
Nevertheless,

the consistency

of the pattern across surveys makes it more likely

that the results are not merely the product

of sampling variability.

In fact, re-

stricting the coefficients on the two dummies to be the same across surveys yields
a value of 0.038 with a standard error of 0.018 for military quitters and 0.032 for
stayers (standard

error 0.0 12).

Both are significantly

stayers is in support of one of our key predictions.

have higher ability than other quitters but lower ability than stayers.

while the

If these rents are large enough,

they may outweigh the quality advantage of the stayer group (see the numerical

the three equilibrium functions w(t), v(t) and fi(t) through the system defined

Note that v(t) is determined

To check the uniqueness of the w(t) and fi (t), we need to study the concavity
of (2.3). We first substitute for fi(t) = w(t) /a(t)
