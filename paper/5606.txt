The surveys contain standard

demographic

and labor market variables but are also particularly rich in details about
workers’ jobs, job attributes, the tools used in these jobs, the skills necessary
to perform a job, and how these skills were obtained. The sampling frame
for the survey is the German employed population age 16 to 65. Each survey
has slightly less than 30,000 respondents.

We use the largest sample possibly,

only deleting a observations which do not have information on the variables
we analyze. The questions in the three surveys are similar but not exactly
comparable.

We report details on the variables we use below.

The questions on computer use differ slightly between the 1979 survey and
the later waves. For the 1979 survey we combine affirmative answers to two
questions as computer users. The first asked about the use of “computers,
terminals, or monitors,” the second inquired about word processors. In the
later surveys there are six categories which we combine:

and CAD systems.

Private returns only accrue to those

with business software. If these workers are scarce, their wages should be

In addition,

the return should accrue to everybody

possessing the skill regardless of whether the worker actually uses a computer
on the job or not.

This effect results from the labor supply side:

A key fact from this table

is that about two thirds of those who possess computer skills do not use a

There is also the labor demand side to be considered,

however.

It only

makes sense to employ a worker with computer knowledge in a non-computer

This argu-

The pattern of coefficients in Table 7 is again robust to controlling for the
same set of occupations as above. When both the computer use and knowledge variables are entered together with occupation

controls (column 7), only

the computer knowledge variable remains positive while the coefficient on the
computer

More importantly, while computer knowledge rather than computer use
seems to explain the wage differential we found for Germany this still does
not explain our findings regarding

the other tools used on the job.

Are Other Ability Controls Adequate?

One way to address the possibility of unobserved heterogeneity in these regressions is to include other controls for ability. Krueger used data from the
High School and Beyond Survey which allowed him to include both a computer dummy and controls for parental background,

relevant in the workplace.

Indeed, even a crude

1. The computer wage differential is three times as high in the nonunion

This is unsurprising since unions are known to compress the wage structure. Thus, all wage differentials tend to be lower within the union
sector. Of course, this ought to be true regardless of whether computers truly capture computer

skills or are instead simply measuring

the

impact of any other work related skills and abilities,

Returns

to skill have increased during the 1980s. Thus, if computer use proxies
for work related skills, then the return to computer use should increase
alongside with other ability related wage differentials such as the return
to schooling.
Krueger argues against this view because of the fast expansion of computer use. If computers

are used by the most able workers first or the

otherwise most highly paid workers first and then slowly spread to less

line managers. These positions are on average better paid, therefore we
find a significant computer differential already in 1979. When personal
computers became available, computer use became more decentralized.
If PCs slowly spread to more highly paid positions,

then the computer

differential may well have risen during the 1980s. According

to Table

1, computer use in Germany grew much faster among the more highly
educated than among the less educated. This may explain a rising computer wage differential in Germany between 1979 and 1991/92
