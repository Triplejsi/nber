26 Lichtenberg (1995) derived the estimate that al= aO(RIK1/~)
= O.108a0 using private sector data as
follows. First, Lichtenberg noted that computer’s comprised 1.8% of total capital assets, or
(P, K,)/(P~)
=0.018. The relative asset prices can be converted to relative rental prices by multiplying by
(R+5,-E(p,))/(R
+60-E(pO)) where R is the interest rate, 8, is the depreciation rate, and E(p,) is the expected
rate of price appreciation, Lichtenberg followed Lau and Tokatsu (1992) who used long run averages to estimate
R= O.07, 6,=0,20,
8.=0.05,
E(pl) =-0.15, and E(pO)=0.05. Taken together, these imply that the ratio of
relative rental to asset prices, is 6 = (,07 +.20+.15)/(.07+.05-,05),
or RIK1/~=6(0,018)
=0, 108.
27 However, a test of excess returns is not significant at the 10% level. The test HO: al-O .03=0 for
regression #5.2 is rejected ordy at the 10.6570 level. Since Lichtenberg’s estimate is based on private sector
data, it would be better to develop a test based on govermnent data.
