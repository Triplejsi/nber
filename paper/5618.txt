TRADE AND SEARCH: SOCIAL CAPITAL,
SOGO SHOSHA, AND SPILLOVERS

ABSTRACT

A network/search

view of international

trade in differentiated products is proposed.

It is

shown that this view can explain the importance of ethnic and extended family ties in trade, the
success of diversified
government

trading intermediaries

such as Japan’s sogo shosha, and the ubiquity of

export promotion policies such as subsidized trade missions.

lPart of the cost of establishing a connection between a seller and a buyer may be mutual
adaptation:
the seller refines his product to better suit the preferences of the buyer and the
buyer (especially if a firm rather than an ultimate consumer) adapts his specifications to
the capabilities of the seller (see Egan and Mody 1992). Gereffi (1994) has especially
emphasized the role of large first-world buyers in identifying and “shaping” third-world
sellers. Within a given industry (e.g., footwear) one can imagine a continuum from sellers
producing a completely specified product and then finding buyers to sellers finding buyers
and then producing a product tailored to their specifications.
The end result in terms of
the impact of distance and “ties” on trade is the same.

bought some ersatz pearl necklaces through family contacts in Hong Kong,

sMany other explanations for the success of the sogo shosha have been offered in the
literature.
For example, Sheard (1992) argues that the sogo shosha compensate for
Japanese capital market imperfections by implicitly insuring against default on trade
credit, a risk they can diversify through their “generality”.
Here I am attempting to
identify a basis for success that can extend to any economy whether or not it shares
Japan’s characteristics,
and thus help us understand the experience of other countries that

12
Particularly import ant ... was the role the sogo shosha played in providing
export opportunities for the myriad small Japanese firms in cottage industries,
which, like their counterparts in developing countries today, faced many
problems in trying to break into the world market. The sogo shosha fed them
market information, helped them design products, extended credit, and, most

penetrating European markets, SVEX researches unt appeal but potentially
important difficult markets such as the former Soviet Union, India, and Japan.
It conducts a detailed market analysis; finds an appropriate political, cultural,

interested in and capable of trading with the target country; invites officials
from that country to visit the firms in Emilia-Romagna;
and eventually
establishes a permanent presence in that market, typically an overseas
