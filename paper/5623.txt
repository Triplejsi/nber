Introduction

Perhaps the most puzzling feature of currency prices is the tendency for high interest
rate currencies to appreciate,

when the expectations

hypothesis suggests the opposite:

that investors will demand higher interest rates on currencies expected to fall in value,
This departure from uncovered

interest parity, which we term the ~oru)ard premium

anomaly, has been documented in dozens — and possibly hunclreds — of studies, and
has spawned a second generation of papers attempting to account for it. One of the

most influential of these is Fama (1984), who attributed
spot exchange rates to a time-varying

risk premium.

the behavior of forward and

Fama showed that the implied

risk premium must (i) be negatively correlated with the expected

rate of depreciation

and (ii) have a greater variance.
We refer to this feature of the data as an anomaly because asset pricing theory to
date has been notably unsuccessful in producing a risk premium with the requisite
properties.

Attempts

include applications

of the capital asset pricing model to cur-

rency prices (Frankel and Engel, 1984; Mark, 1988), statistical models relating risk
premiums to changing second moments (Cumby,

1983), and consumption-based

We

address more recent attempts to account for the anomaly with affine models later in
the paper.
We study the anomaly in both a general theoretical framework and in the more
limited class of affine models. We express our general framework in terms of prici~ig
kerrlels:
stochastic processes governing prices of state-contingent
claims,
In this
framework,

we relate the spot exchange rate to pricing kernels in the two currencies

and describe the properties the kernels must have to account for the puzzling behavior
of forward

and spot exchange

rates.

The anomaly implies, in general, an inverse
relation between differences in conditional means and differences in conditional higher
moments of pricing kernels,

We then turn to specific models that might account for the anomaly and other
features of currency prices and interest rates. Natural candidates are affine models,

Accordingly,

we summarize the properties of spot and forward exchange rates for the LTS dollar
versus the remaining G7 currencies and interest rates for the same currencies, Here
and elsewhere, st is the logarithm of the dollar price of one unit of foreign currency
and ~~is the logarithm of the dollar price of a one-month forward contract: a contract

in our sample, mean depreciation rates are smaller than their standard deviations,
typically by a factor of about eight. In this sense, volatility is one of the most striking
features of currency prices. There is also weak evidence that depreciation

rates exhibit

greater kurtosis than one would find with the normal distribution, but none of our
estimated measures of skewness or kurtosis exceeds twice its estimated standarcl error,

none of the measures of skewness and kurtosis are more than twice as large as their

One way to think about this evidence is to relate it to the expectations

hypothesis:

that forward rates are expected future spot rates, We express this in logarithmic forlm
as ~t = EtSt+I or ~t — st = Etst+l — St, where Et denotes the expectation conditional
on date-t information. Although we do not observe expected future spot rates, we can
get an indication

of the accuracy of the expectations

hypothesis

by comparing

mean

forward premiums with mean depreciation rates across currencies. We see in Figure
1 (based on entries from Table 1) that while the two means are not the same, their
differences are small relative to their cross-sectional

variation.

Currencies with large

forward premiuins, on average, are also those against which the dollar has depreciated
the most. In other words, currencies with average interest rates higher than the dollar
have typically fallen in value relative to the dollar.

The pricing kernel ?n and the pricing relation (5) are the basis of modern theories
of bond pricing: given a pricing kerne], we use (5) to compute prices and yielcls for

Denote by ~ the price of an n-period zero-coupon bond:

start instead with the two pricing kernels, which highlights the essential symmetry of
the theory between the two currencies.
One implication of this symmetric perspective is that pricing kernels appear to be

( 1991) bouncls are similar. If pricing kernels for other currencies exhibit, comparable
variability, then equation (10) implies that the correlation between the logarithms of
the two kernels is 0,98. Larger estimates of Var(log m) and Var(log m“) and smaller
estimates of Var(st+l

— St) imply larger correlations.

The strong correlation

between

pricing kernels is not an indication of international capital mobility — capital mobility was, in fact, a premise of Proposition 1, We find it striking nevertheless, since
it implies that state prices are more highly correlated across currencies than returns.
Roughly

speaking, the two pricing kernels appear to be more highly correlated

Forward

Rat es and Risk Premiums

Given pricing kernels for two currencies and equation (9) for spot exchange rates,
we can derive the forward premium and its components from the pricing relation
(4).

Consider

that short rates are negative, the model differs sharply from the data along other
dimensions.
Our model starts with three scalar state variables following square root processes

between ~ and 7*. If Vur(z) is diagonal, as in the examples of Section 5.1, then the
ith elements of ~ —~“ — ~ + T“ and y — ~“ must have different signs for at least one i.
More generally, the covariance hinges on differences in the effects of state variables on

In this sense, the asymmetric

effect of the state variables on the two pricing kernels in our two examples is a general
requirement of a model that accounts for the anomaly.
This model also makes it clear why models with independent

factors in Section 4.2

cannot account for the anomaly with positive interest rates. This model is a special
case in which z can be partitioned

Models

of Bond

Pricing

Duffie and Kan (1993) characterize a class of affine bond pricing models in continuous
time. We translate their class of models into discrete time and derive conditions under
which bond yields are strictly positive.
Duffie and Kan’s affine models are based on a k-dimensional

vector of state vari-

(31)

where {et} w NID(O, 1), @ is a stable matrix with positive diagonal elements, V(g)

is

a diagonal matrix with typical element

and Dz has nonnegative

elements.

State prices are governed by a pricing kernel of the

form

by (31 ,32) and satisfying Condition

A as the Dufie-

models.

Our characterization of “these models differs from Duffie and Kan’s in two respects.
First, Duffie and Kan write (31) as

Q)(o– Zt)+ Xv(z) l’’ct+l,

is innocuous

We show that our choice

by reducing their model to ours. As in Section A.1, the key is that z is

not directly observable.

Assume X is invertible (this is convenient

and define z’ = X–l z. If we substitute for z, equation

but not essential)

(33) becomes

2:+1 — z; = (1 — Q’)(O’ — z;) + v’(z’)1’2&t+1,
with u~(z’) = ai + ,fljTz’, Q’ = ~–lo~,

d’ = X–16, and @jT = @lTX, Equation

(32)

becomes
– log mt+~ = 8 + 7’T2; + ATv’(z;)l/2&i+l.
with ~’T = VT X. Thus we have effectively eliminated

X from the model.

Our second difference from Dufie and Kan is the assumption that the volatility
parameters ~; are nonnegative. Define the matrix ~ = (@l, . . . , p~) with ~;j denoting
the jth element of pi and the (i)j)th element of PT. Note that we can choose the
diagonal elements of ~ to be nonnegative:

is not restrictive:

if a model is not

invertible, we can construct an equivalent invertible ~model with a smaller state vector.
Analogously,

define the vector AT = [A’(nl),

. . . . A’(nk)].

W’e now turn to a smaller class of models in which bond yields are always positive:

Dates t run from July 1974 to November 1994 (245 observations).

An asterisk (*) indicates a sample moment at least twice its Newey-West standard
error. The letters s and ~ denote logarithms of spot and one-month forward exchange
rates, respectively,

measured in dollars per unit of foreign currency, and r denotes the

continuously-compounded

one-month

yield.

Mean is the sample mean, St Dev the

sample standard deviation,

Skewness an estimate of the skewness measure ~1, Kurtosis

an estimate of the kurtosis measure 72, and Autocorr

the first auto correlation.

The

skewness and kurtosis measures are defined, specifically, in terms of central moments
p3: “~~= p3/p;12

and TZ = pA/p~ — 3. Both are zero for normal random variables.
Our estimates replace population moments with sample moments.
