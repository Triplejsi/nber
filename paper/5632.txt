Notes
1.
Some observers draw a distinction
between labor standards
(such as minimum
work ages) and labor rights (such as the right to bargain collectively) .
Although this distinction
is meaningful,
for this paper I will use the term
labor standards
to cover both standards and rights.

Freeman
(1994) writes, “I do not accept the premise of some that bad
standards drive out good standards.
Any country that wants higher Labour
standards for itself can have them. .. if it is willing to pay.”
My point is
that lower standards abroad may alter the price that the country will have to
pay.
