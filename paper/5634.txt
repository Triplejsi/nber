IMPERFECT COMPETITION AND THE
EFFECTS OF ENERGY PRICE
INCREASES ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

ABSTRACT

We show that modifying
competition

the standard neoclassical

growth model by assuming that

is imperfect makes it easier to explain the size of the declines in output and real

wages that follow increases in the price of oil. Plausibly parametrized

models of this type are

able to mimic the response of output and real wages in the United States.

The responses are

particularly consistent with a model of implicit collusion where markups depend positively on
the ratio of the expected present value of future profits to the current level of output.
