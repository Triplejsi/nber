HYPERBOLIC DISCOUNT FUNCTIONS,
UNDERSAVING, AND SAV~GS POLICY

Studies of animal and human behavior suggest that discount functions are approximately
hyperbolic (Ainslie, 1992). I analyze an economy with complete markets which is populated by
hyperbolic consumers.

I identify two ways in which this economy can be distinguished
