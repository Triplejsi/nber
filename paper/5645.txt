MEASURING THE EFFECTS OF
COGNITIVE ABILITY
ABSTRACT
This paper presents new evidence from the NLSY on the importance of meritocracy in
American society. In it, we find that general intelligence, or “g”-- a measure of cognitive ability--is
dominant in explaining test score variance. The weights assigned to tests by “g” are similar for all
major demographic groups. These results support Spearman’s theory of “g.”
We also find that “g” and other measures of ability are not rewarded equally across race and
gender, evidence against the view that the labor market is organized on meritocratic principles,
Additional factors beyond “g” are required to explain wages and occupational choice. However,
both blue collar and white collar wages are poorly predicted by “g” or even multiple memures of
ability. Observed cognitive ability is only a minor predictor of social performance. White collar
wages are more “g” loaded than blue collar wages. Many noncognitive factors determine blue collar
wages.

In their controversial book The Bell Curve, Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray
summarize an impressive body of research on the correlations between social outcomes and
scores on tests of cognitive ability. A remarkable finding of the research they survey is that one
linear combination of tests - called “g” - predicts performance almost as well as the full battery
of tests. 1 Charles Spearman first proposed that general intelligence, or “g”, is a common ability
that explains petiormance on all tests of intelligence.

General intelligence was also thought to

be heritable although that is a completely separate matter.2
Both assumptions have been questioned in the scholarly literature. Theories of multiple
abilities go back to Thurstone (1947). Carroll (1993) provides a comprehensive discussion of
the evidence. The theory of the heritability of intelligence is simplified by, but does not require,
unidirnensioml ability. The Bell Curve embraces both “g” and heritability. Moreover, it extends
Spearman and attempts to demonstrate that differences in “g” explain discrepancies in social
outcomes across race.
This paper examines the arguments for, and the empirical evidence about, g. Using the
NLSY (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth) data employed by Murray and Herrnstein we
demonstrate that “g” explains a majority of the variance in test scores.

Other combinations

explain at most a fifth of what “g” explains. Moreover, the weights of “g” on the constituent
tests are remarkably similar across race and gender. The classical theory of “g” is alive and well
in the NNY.

Ironically, while Herrnstein and Murray embrace the theory of “g”, they use a

different (though highly correlated) measure of ability in their analysis.

Carroll (1993) presents a more balanced discussion.

Not much should be made of the fact that “g” explains a majority of the variance in the
test scores. The classical theory of “g” is an artifact of linear correlation analysis. Using a result
established by Suppes and Zanotti (1981), a scalar measure of ability can always be constructed
to filly explain the variance in a battery of test scores. This is a theorem in mathematics and not
a statement about behavior. Ironically, Spearman and his successors rob “g” of explanatory
power by estimating it using linear methods. The best measure of “g” is in general a nonlinear
function of the constituent test scores.
Except for psychometrician,

few persons are interested in test scores per se. Instead,

interest focuses on the behavior correlated with the tests. The great contribution of Herrnstein
and Murray is to relate tests to a wide range of social outcomes:

education, occupatioml

attainment, crime, unemployment, and participation in welfare. They establish that tests are
strongly correlated with these outcomes although other factors are also important.
Herrnstein and Murray argue that the U.S. has become more of a meritocracy in the last
generation; that ability plays an increasingly important role in determining social outcomes. They
attribute disparities in social performance by gender and race to disparities in ability and they
interpret the rising wage return to schooling as a rise in the return to ability.
This paper examines the role of tests in explaining wages. We consider whether more
than “g” is required to summarize the effects of tests on wages. We also consider whether “g”
and other components of ability are priced equally across demographic groups. Central to the
theory of meritocracy is the notion that ability is the basis for achievement. If the same measures
of ability are priced differently across different demographic groups, something besides the
meritocratic principle is at work in producing labor market outcomes.

2

Our study of the NLSY data reveals that the weighting of the test scores used to produce
“g” is remarkably similar across demographic groups. “g” explains between 55 and 70 percent
of the total variance in the matrix of correlations of test scores for all groups.
Our evidence on the performance of “g” in predicting wages is much less favorable.
First, several other components of measured ability besides “g” are statistically significant in
predicting log wages. Second, measured ability accounts for a small fraction of the variance in
log wages. Even after a generous allowance for measurement error in wages, ability, education,
and experience combined account for at most one third of the total variance in wages, Third,
in a variety of specifications of log wage equations, the economic returns to measured ability
differ across demographic groups, contrary to what is predicted by the theory of meritocracy,
One reason why abilities may be priced differently across different demographic groups
is that there are systematic differences in preferences for employment in different sectors for
different groups. We examine this possibility below and more extensively elsewhere (Cawley,
et al., 1996a) by estimating a model of occupatioml choice that corrects for the self-selection
bias that may give rise to different measured prices of skills across sectors. This estimation
reveals that “g” plays an important role both in occupational selection and in wage
determination. White collar wages are more strongly correlated with “g” than are blue collar
wages, but abilities orthogoml to “g” are also important in both sectors. Blue collar wages are
affected by more abilities than are white collar wages. Many of the abilities important for
explaining blue collar wages are not cognitive in mture. More abilities than “g” are also
required to successfully predict occupational choice.
The National Longitudiml Survey of Youth (NNY) is designed to represent the entire

3

population of American youth and consists of a randomly chosen sample of6,111 U.S. civilian
youths,

a supplemental

sample of 5,295 randomly chosen minority and economically

disadvantaged civilian youths, and a sample of 1,280 youths on active duty in the military, All
youths were between thirteen and twenty years of age in 1978 and were interviewed annually
starting in 1979.

The data include equal numbers of males and females.

Roughly 16% of

respondents are Hispanic and 25% are black. For our analysis, we restrict the sample to those
not currently enrolled in school and those persons receiving an hourly wage between $.50 and
$1000 in 1990 dollars (all results of this

paper

are

reported in 1990 dollars).

This paper uses

the NNY weights for each year to produce a natiomlly representative sample. However, our
sample is not nationally representative in age; we ordy observe an eight year range of ages in
any given year, and the oldest person in our 1993 sample is ordy 36.
In 1980, NLSY respondents were administered a battery often intelligence tests referred
to as the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery.

We describe the ASVAB subtests in

Appendix 1 and provide summary statistics in Appendix 2. Appendix 3 presents the ingredients
required to construct the model of occupatioml choice discussed in Section 3.

1. Principal Component Analysis
The first issue we consider is the appropriate measure of intelligence to use for predicting
wages. Herrnstein and Murray (1994) argue that there is only one significant intelligence factor,
called general intelligence or “g.” They fail to mention that many psychometrician

who endorse

the theory of general intelligence also maintain that there exist other factors of intelligence which
have less explamtory power than “g” but are nonetheless both statistically and numerically

4

significant in describing outcomes. For example, Spearman (1927) incorporates specific factors
“s” which complement general intelligence “g.” Cattell (1987) describes two forms of general
intelligence:

“fluid” , which is applied to all tasks, and “crystallized” which is a combination

of fluid intelligence and practice or study of a specific task.

Carroll (1993) posits a ~ee-

stratum theory of intelligence in which cognitive abilities range from the narrow to the highly
general. By omitting mention of specific and narrow cognitive abilities, Herrnstein and Murray
give the misleading impression that intelligence can be fully described by “g.”
In this paper, “g” is measured by the product of the test score vector and the eigenvector
associated with the largest eigenvalue of the matrix of correlations among standardized ASVAB
scores.

It is well known that the score on “ability” tests rises with the age and the education

of the test taker, This by itself indicates that the tests measure knowledge and not some abstract
ability that is independent of specific knowledge. To account for this finding, we present six
sets of results, each associated with a different measure of cognitive ability. We construct these
measures of “g” by estimating principal components from the matrices of correlations of:
(1) umdjusted test scores;
(2) test scores adjusted for age (as in Herrnstein and Murray).
(3), (4) two adjustments of test scores for age, race, and gender.
(5) test scores adjusted for age and education at the time of the ASVAB test, race, and gender.
(6) test scores adjusted for age and education at the time of the ASVAB test, and the highest
grade of education achieved by both parents, race and gender.

By “adjusted,” we mean that each of the ten ASVA.B tests was regressed on the appropriate
combimtion of age, education, and parents’ education, separately by race and gender,

and

principal components were estimated for the residuals. For measure (2), ASVB scores were ordy
standardized by age. Urdike the other methods, the standardization does not assume or impose

5

a 1inear relationship between age and measured ability.
In our sample, the correlation between AFQT score and education at age 23 is ,6. Our
measures of “g” that are residualized on education produce lower-bound estimates of the
importance of cognitive ability; our method attributes all overlap of ability with education to
education,

Likewise, all overlap of ASVAB scores with parents’ education is attributed to the

latter in one of our measures of “g.”
We use principal components to estimate “g” but principal factor analysis and hierarchical
factor amlysis produce essentially the same results. The principal components method is the least
affected by sampling error (Jensen, 1987), but Ree and Earles (1991) find that the correlation
between each pair of the three estimates of “g” is .996. However, no matter which method is
used, “g” is only as good a measure of cognitive ability as its constituent tests. Many features
of personality and motivation are not captured by the ASVAB.
Hermstein and Murray use the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score which is
the sum of the ASVAB subtests Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehemion,
Reasotig,

and Mathematics Knowledge as their measure of general intelligence.

Arithmetic
If AFQT is

the best measure of general intelligence, then the fiist principal component should weight each
of the four subtests that constitute AFQT by an equal amount and assign zero weights to all
other subtests. We do not find such a pattern in the weights of any of our six versions of the
first principal component. For example, Table 1 lists the ASVAB weights for the first principal
component which is standardized by age, race, and gender; these weights suggest that while
AFQT is highly correlated with “g” @ = O.829), it is a suboptimal measure of general
intelligence, which suggests that Hermstein and Murray underestimate the effect of intelligence

6

on social outcomes.
Table 1 also indicates that the first principal component is strikingly similar across race
and gender. This has generally been found to be true for different racial populations that share
the same language and culture (Jensen, 1987). These loadings are similar to those produced if
principal components are computed for the sample as a whole rather than separately for each
race and gender group. Speeded tests (Numerical Operations and Coding Speed) receive little
weight, while the achievement tests that constitute AFQT are heavily weighted.
For all groups except black females, the second principal component heavily weights the
speeded subtests. Carroll (1993) describes this commordy-found speeded intelligence factor as
“Numerical Facility. ” The specification of g is robust to the removal of subtests from the
matrix; six subtests must be removed before the Numerical Facility factor becomes the first
principal component.

Beyond the second factor there are few similarities in the principal

components across race and gender groups.
Table 2 contains the proportion of variance in ASVAB test scores attributable to the
principal components; again, we use the first principal component standardized by age, race, and
gender as an example. Results are comparable for other standardizations. Table 2 indicates that
g, the f~st principal component, is dominant in the ASVAJ3 test score matrix--it explains
between 55.2 % and 70.6% of the variation in the test scores of each race-gender group.3 Ordy
for white men and women does the Numerical Facility factor explain more than 10% of the
variance in test scores (11.4% and 10.8% respectively).

explanatory power for men than for women, For each of our six measures of general
intelligence, the first principal component explains more test score variance than any other
principal component.
The dominance of the first factor in explaining variance in the test correlation matrix
should not be interpreted as convincing evidence in favor of a single factor called intelligence.
Suppes and Zanotti (1981) have shown that it is possible to construct a scalar latent factor from
a vector of test scores such that conditional on the factor, test scores are statistically
independent. If D = (dl,..., d~) is a vector of T binary random variables with density f(D),then
there always exists a factor g such that
T

t=1

so that “g” plays the role of a single factor in conventioml factor analysis; that is, conditional
on “g,” test scores are independent. Standard probability arguments can be used to extend their
theorem to countable-valued random variables (e.g. success proportions on exams), and hence
to approximate continuous variables arbitrarily well (see, e.g. Holland and Rosenbaum, 1986).
“g” exists for any vector of finite-valued random variables; it is not a result derived from the
nature of intelligence.

The key test for a theory of single intelligence is not how well “g”

explains performance on the intelligence tests from which it is derived, but how well it predicts
social outcomes.

This is the subject of the next two sections.

2. Wages and Ability
Hermstein and Murray note that large residuals are common in wage regressions, and
speculate:
8

“What then is this [wage] residual, this X factor, that increasingly commands a
wage premium- over and above education? It could be a variety of factors . . .
but readers will not be surprised to learn that we believe that it includes
cognitive ability.”4
They perform no empirical analysis of wages but cite a study of the NNY by Blackbum and
Neumark (1993) which concludes that the rise in the return to education is concentrated among
the smartest workers. Elsewhere (Cawley et al., 1996b), we test and refine the conclusions of
Blackbum and Neumark,
If this, and the assumption of general intelligence, are correct, then the coefficient for
“g” in wage regressions should be numerically important and statistically significant. Previous
research (Ree and Earles, 1991; Ree, Earles, and Teachout, 1994) has concluded that “g” is
Domimnce

“dominant” in explaining job performance.

in this context means that the

contribution to R2 of additional test score components is “small” relative to that of “g.” Close
examination of this work reveals that the additional components are statistically significant and
that “g” explains much less than half of the variance in the outcomes studied (supervisor ratings
and success in military occupatioml training schools).
This section examines the relationship between the ability and wages in our sample. We
estimate the following model of wages:
Wit = ~ai + TXi~+ 7, + sit
E(~l I ai,XiJ = O
E(&itI ai,XiJ = O

&ilis the error term for individual i in year t, and Ei is the covariance matrix of the

error terms across time for individual i. &i[and &j[,are statistically independent for all i # j. We
specify the human capital variables to include schooling (measured as grades completed),
schooling squared (to allow for diminishing returns to education), weeks of tenure in the current
job, tenure squared, labor market experience (defined by Mincer (1974) as age minus schooling
minus 6) and experience squared.

We fit separate regressions

for each race-gender group. Using F tests, the statistics from which are reported at the bottom
of each table, we decisively reject the null hypothesis that the wage returns to ability are equal
across race and gender groups.

We reject this hypothesis for all six measures of cognitive

ability and both versions of the regression.

Especially relevant are Tables 3RA and 3RB, for

which the principal components are standardized only by year of birth; these indicate that an

equal gain in cognitive ability is rewarded in significantly different ways across race and gender
in the labor market. In general, females earn a higher return to “g.”
Our stacked regression model is motivated by the failure to reject in a joint F-test the null
hypothesis that the coefficients are equal across years. Because of the panel mture of the data,
the error term is correlated across time for individuals.

We correct for this by using Eicker-

White standard errors generalized for panel data. Because we restrict analysis to individuals who
are out of school and employed, each individual is not necessarily in our sample for all fifteen
years; the panel is unbalanced.b
The results in Tables 3 support the theory of multiple strata of intelligence, with “g”
dominant in explaining social outcomes.7 In each case, the fust principal component, “g”, is
statistically significant and positive for all race-gender groups. s The coefficient of “g” is almost
always larger than that of any other principal component, but the gap depends on how much the
test scores have been adjusted. The gap is largest for the principal components associated with
unadjusted test scores (Table 3QA and Table 3QB) and is smallest for the principal components
associated with the most highly -residualtied test scores (Table 30A and Table 30B), where the

Unemployed
workers are also excluded fmm the sample, since their wage is not observed.
.8% of all pemon-year observations arc excluded due to
unemployment, and 24.7 % are excluded because of school enrollment. This does not affect our estimates as long as the population of
interest is employed, out-of-school workers. However, if the population of interest includes tie unemployed and students then it is
necessary to correct for self-selwtion into the sample. We use a muldnomiaf pmbit selection model to correct for this bias using Lee’s
(1983) generalization of the Heckman two step method, and fmd that these correcti

component would have a coefficient of equal magnitude, but opposite sign. The coefficient of the first principal component is meaningful
because it has positive weighk on afl ASVAB subtests; a negative coefficient unequivocally means that less intelligent workers earn more.

our sample sizes are large, we use a significance

the paper.

It should be noted, however,

that

the power of sigtilcance
tests is not equal across demographic groups since the group sizes are unequaf. Rather than arbitrarily equalizing
the power of our tests, which would lead to equal incidence of type fl errors but unequal incidence of Type I error across groups, we
present p values in tables to petit
readers to draw their own conclusions.

coefficient of the third principal component exceeds that of “g” for hispanic males.

On the

whole, these results are similar to those found by Ree et al. for job training and job
performance; secondary factors are statistically significant but contribute little to the predictive
power (R2) of the model. Because principal components are mutually orthogoml and their
variances equal, their margiml contribution to R2 is proportioml to their coefficients in the
models with only test scores as regressors. Thus there is meaning attached to the notion that one
variable in a regression contributes more than another in regressions which only include the test
scores (See Goldberger, 1968).
The results in the Table 3 series conflict with the model of cognitive determinism
implicit in Herrnstein and Murray.

The highest R2 from these regressions is .2852, for black

females (goodness of fit is higher for women than men in each racial group).

Even accounting

for measurement error using the estimates of Bound (1993), ability, education, experience, and
job tenure account for less than a third of wage variation.
The structure of wage residuals cotilrms that a single form of cognitive ability is driving
wage outcomes.

Principal components were estimated for the wage residuals formed from a

regression of log wages on the background model (time dummies and human capital measures).
The results, in Table 4, indicate that a single principal component is dominant in explaining each
group’s wage residuals (between 41. 9% and 54.1 %), which is consistent with the hypothesis of
a single omitted ability variable.
The contribution of ability measures to the overall fit of the model is dwarfed by that of
other observed characteristics.

Tables 5A, 5B, 5C, and 5D provide upper and lower bounds on

the contribution of our six ability measures, plus AFQT, to R2 in log wage regressions.

12

If

ability is the only regressor, ability contributes between .068 and .179 to R2; when human
capital measures are controlled for, the marginal R2 of ability falls to between .034 and .005.
There are two important conclusions. First, if there exists some “X factor” that can explain the
large residuals common in wage regressions, it is not measured cognitive ability.

Second, it

makes little difference in terms of predictive power which measure of ability is used; the
difference in R2 between them (controlling for education, experience, and job tenure) is less than
.09 for each race-gender group.
3. Ability, Wages, and the Choice of Occupation
There are at least two possible routes through which cognitive ability can affect wages.
First, it can influence the choice of occupation. Second, it can affect wages within occupations.
The factors of intelligence that drive occupational choice may differ from those which determine
wages within occupations. In this section, we explore how “g” determines occupational choice
and wages conditioml on that choice. For this section, we use ordy the “g” standardized by
race, gender, and age.
We classi~ all occupations as either white collar or blue collar.

White collar workers

are those working in sectors described by the U. S. Census as “Professional, Technical, and
Kindred Workers,” “Non-Farm Managers and Administrators,” “Sales Workers,” and “Clerical
and Unskilled Workers, ” The last group encompasses only white-collar unskilled workers, such
as cashiers, file clerks, bill collectors, and messengers.
We simultaneously estimate choice of occupation and wages conditional on that choice.
Following Cameron and Heckman (1992, revised; 1996), we estimate the following version of
the Roy model of wages and occupational choice. Individual subscripts are suppressed.

Instead of assuming joint normality of e, and q~,,,q,,,, we estimate a nonp~ame~ic factor
structure model to account for the correlation in an individual wages over time. p and a are
factor loadings and ~

is an unobserved factor that does not vary over time; it might be

unobserved ability, for example, or motivation. In this model, ~ is the sole source of dependence
between emor terms at a point in time and the sole source of dependence for a given error term

14

over time.9 We do not know the distribution of the unobserved factor ~but we can consistently
estimate the distribution using a discrete approximation (see Heckrnan and Singer, 1984 and
Cameron and Heckman, 1987). In this paper, we find that a discrete approximation (f= f, or f
= f,) fits the data well. We estimate the probability of each value off, P(f = f,) = P,, P(f = f,)
= Pz = 1- PI as well as the values of f. The fitted model is thus a binomial discrete factor model.
Details on constructing the likelihood are given in Appendix 3. The basic approach goes back to
Heckman and Singer (1984) and Cameron and Heckman (1987).
In our model, Z, contains variables that affect preferences for a white collar or blue collar
occupation. These include test scores, years of education, Mincer’s measure of potential
experience, and indicator variables for the year the observation is recorded and whether the
respondent’s mother or father had a white collar job. ~ contains the variables that affect wages,
which in our model include test scores, years of education, Mincer’s measure of potential
experience, local and national unemployment rates, and indicator variables for the year and region
of residence.
Table 6 contains estimated occupational choice coefficients from a model in which wages
and occupational choices are determined simultaneously. The parameters corresponds to the net
gain equation. These coefficients represent preferences by the worker for a specific sector of
employment.

Table 6 indicates that while “g” has a substantial effect on occupational choice,

other characteristics are also important. The difference in log wages between the two sectors has
a statistically-significant correlation with choice of occupation, as does education. Moreover, “g”
is not the only important factor in wages; the second principal component is statistically

Table 7 contains the coefficients in the blue collar wage regression simultaneously
estimated with the model for occupational choice; the table indicates that “g” is not dominant in
explaining wage differences across blue collar workers.

Many other factors besides “g” are

statistically significant. For four of the six race-gender groups, the return to a standard deviation
of “g” is less than that accorded an extra year of education. For all groups, the wage effects of
region of residence can offset the wage effect of an extra standard deviation of “g.” For

five

of

the six race/gender groups, the wage effects of local or national unemployment offset the wage
gain from an extra standard deviation of “g.”
Table 8 contains the coefficients in the white collar wage regression simultaneously
estimated with the model for occupational choice. In contrast to the blue collar wage regression,
for this group “g” has the largest correlation with wages of any principal component; this means
that white collar occupations are more “g” loaded. Fewer ability components are statistically
significant than is the case for blue collar wages. Once again, the returns to cognitive ability
seem small in relation to that of other variables. The return to a standard deviation of “g” is
rivalled by that to two years of education, and can be offset by region of residence and local
unemployment rates.
The coefficient on schooling is significantly larger in the white collar sector than the blue
collar sector for each race-gender group. This is consistent with the finding of Keane and Wolpin
(1994) who use simulation and interpolation to solve a discrete-choice dynamic programming
problem of schooling and occupational choice for NLSY males 1979-88, and find that schooling
increased white collar skill 7°/0 and blue collar skill 2.4°/0.

16

The overall results indicate that the correlations of “g” with occupational choice and wages
within sectors are generally statistically significant but modest in magnitude. The effects of a few
years of education, the sector of parent’s employment, and region of residence combined with
the local unemployment rate rival or exceed the coefficient of “g” in magnitude.
4. Conclusion
Our results are consistent with the theory of general intelligence: “g“ explains a majority
of the variance in test scores and “g” is remarkably similar across race and gender. However,
our results conflict with the predictions of Herrnstein and Murray; the correlations of “g” with
wages and occupational choice are modest compared to those of education, family background,
and region of residence. We also find that the returns to “g” differ significantly across race and
gender; payment is not made for “ability” alone.

Judged by contribution to R-squared in a

regression of wages on ability, education, and work experience, none of our six measures of “g”
is preferable to any other.

White collar wages are more highly loaded on “g” than are blue

collar wages. Ability factors other than “g” are economically useful in both sectors. More than
“g” drives occupational choice. In sum, measured cognitive ability is correlated with wages but
explains little of the variance in wages across individuals and time, a finding mirrored in
Ecclesiastes 9:11:
. . .[T]he race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to
the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill;
but time and chance happeneth to them all.

Appendix 3: The Sample Likelihood For The Model of Occupational Choice
We impose the exclusion restriction that region of residence and local and national
unemployment rates are included in X[ but not in Z1. Those variables are assumed to affect
wages but not preferences; such exclusion restrictions augmented with additional full support
conditions permit nonparameteric identification of the model given the one factor structure. We
assume that v~and u, are normally distributed, but allow the distribution of ~ to be arbitrary,
subject to regulari~ conditions. We find that a two point distribution for ~ is adequate to fit the
data.
The likelihood function is formed assuming independent sampling across persons,
Assuming that the support of common factor f is discrete, contribution to likelihood S of a
person is:
Increment to f = ~
[j
“F i

1
g(~o,t
lxt~)~r(~t=oIx,ZtJ.)Pj 1‘i’
1
g(~l,t

lx,f)~ti~t=1lx,,ztJ)Pj“

The conditional density of wages in occupation “O” is:

The conditioml density of wages in occupation “1” is:

The conditiomd probability that occupation 1 selected is:

where u: = 1 and where we denote the standard normal distribution by @ and the standard
normal density by @. We estimate the distribution of j nonparametrically with a ftite
distribution, estimating Pj and \ along with the remaining parameters of the model.
