THE EFFECTS OF CHILD-BEARING ON
MARRIED WOMEN’ S LABOR SUPPLY
AND EARNINGS: USING TWIN BIRTHS
AS A NATURAL EXPERIMENT

ABSTRACT

Married women’s decisions about child-bearing and market work are importantly interrelated.
Although there are many estimates of the effects of fertility on female labor supply few of them have
adequately addressed the problems of simultaneity inherent in these choices. In this paper, we use
exogenous variations in fertility due to twin births to measure the impact of an unanticipated
on married women’s

labor supply and earnings.

We find that the short-run

child

effects of an

unanticipated birth on labor supply are appreciable and have increased in magnitude as more mothers
enter the labor market. It also appears that the impact of unanticipated births on earnings and wages
has changed from 1980 to 1990. In 1980 reduced labor supply caused a temporary drop in earnings,
but in 1990 earnings and wages remained depressed well after the labor supply effects of a twin birth
had disappeared.

The Effects of Child-Bearing

on Married Women’s

Labor Supply on Earnings:
Using Twin Births as a Natural Experiment

1.

Introduction
Despite the dramatic increase in married women’s labor force participation

recent decades, in most families women continue to be responsible
of childcare and other nonmarket

rates in

for providing the majority

services. 1 Fuchs (1989) has argued that conflicting

demands on women’s time have been an important factor inhibiting the reduction of gender
gaps in earnings and occupations.

To meet familial obligations,

he argues, many women

drop out of the labor force entirely, while others look for part-time or less demanding

types

1 According to Juster and Stafford (1991, p. 474) in 1981 American women spent over
two times as many hours doing housework (30.5) as American men (13.5). For married
women with children under 5 at home, Robinson (1988) reports that hours of housework fell
to 22,5 per week in 1985 from 32 per week in 1965. On the other hand, in 1985 married
men with children under 5 at home averaged just 9 hours of housework, up from 3.9 hours
in 1965. Jacobsen (1994, p. 61) calculates that although the fraction of time spent by both
men and women in child care is relatively small, women spend 4 times as much time
engaged in this activity as men.

for example, Shultz (1978), Dooley (1982), Moffit (1984), Hotz and Miller (1988).
Although most of these studies find substantially different parameters when fertility is treated
as endogenous, Mroz (1987) concludes on the basis of extensive specification tests that the
erogeneity of actual fertility cannot be rejected.

unwed motherhood.

an increasing function of the number of pregnancies, and the number of pregnancies is likely

challenge in using the twins first approach arises from the need to identify a large enough
sample of twin mothers.

Rosenzweig and Wolpin’s (1980) estimates, for example, are based

on a sample of just 87 twin mothers--with

the result that most of their coefficient estimates

are not very precise.
Here we use the Public Use Micro Samples (PUMS) from the 1980 and 1990
censuses to identify large samples of twins-first mothers in each year.

We compare this

first births.

We find that in both years, exogenous variations in fertility cause a significant,
reduction in married women’s labor supply.

As the overall rate of labor force

has increased for married women over the decade of the 1980s, we find that the

size of the labor supply effects has also increased.

Although the labor supply effects of

exogenous fertility variations appear to be relatively transitory in both 1980 and 1990, we
find that they have a more persistent impact on wages and earning.

Moreover the magnitude

of the impact on earnings appears to have increased substantially between 1980 and 1990.

(Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1980, pp. 336-37; Bronars

To isolate the pure effect of fertility variations it is thus

necessary to control for variations in age at first birth.
The basic regression framework that we use to estimate the treatment effects
controlling

for age at first birth is as follows:
Yji = ajO+ ajlAGEFBi + ajzAGEFB~ + aj~TWINS li + ui,

where i indexes individual observations,

(1)

Yj is the jth outcome variable, AGEFB is age at first

birth, TWINS 1 is an indicator variable equal to one if the woman had twins in the first birth
and zero otherwise,

and u is a disturbance term.

Because of the independence

between the

TWINS 1 indicator variable and all other factors influencing the outcome variables Y, we can
subsume the influence of these other variables into the disturbance term.

The impact of

twins first on the jth outcome variables is estimated by the coefficient aj~.5
To compile a sample of twins-first mothers we used data from the 1980 and 1990
Census PUMS (Bureau of the Census 1983, 1993).

For 1980 we drew a l-in-5 random

sample from the 5 % (A) sample, and for 1990 we used the 1% (B) sample of the census.
The PUMS data contain a single record for each individual in each household,

which

and economic characteristics.

5 Note that this approach provides an estimate of the effect of the discrete event “twins
in the first birth. ” Alternatively, it is possible to obtain an estimate of the relationship
between the number of children in a household and the outcome variables of interest using
the occurrence of twins as an instrumental variable which affects the number of children but
is uncorrelated with the error term. See Bronars and Grogger (1994, p. 1143).

sample a woman had to: (1) be

living with the same number of children as she reported ever having born; (2) have no
children older than 18, and (3) have a second child with the same age as her oldest child.
Mothers of children over the age of 18, and mothers living apart from their children were
excluded from the sample to ensure that it consisted of women whose oldest children were
twins and not women whose oldest children remaining in the home were twins.

To construct

the control group we randomly sampled women who met criteria (1) and (2), but had
singleton first births.
A total of 1,924 twins-first mothers were located in the 1990 PUMS, and 6,428 nontwin mothers were sampled as controls.

For 1980 we located 1,987 twins-first mothers,

drew a sample of 8,085 non-twin mothers as controls.

Because of the potential differences

labor supply response to fertility variations across married and unmarried mothers we further
restricted our sample to include only currently married (not separated) women.

Finally, to

focus on the civilian labor market, we excluded the very small number of mothers who
reported that they were employed in the armed forces.
Table 1 reports the means and standard deviations of a variety of variables for twin
and non-twin mothers in 1980 and 1990.

Blacks make up 9-12 percent of our samples in

1980 and about 8 percent of our samples in 1990.

As the table shows, within the first two years after birth, the effects of twins

is very close to that of adding an additional child.

Thereafter the effect diminishes.

In the

most extreme case, that of White mothers in 1990, by 12 to 18 years after the occurrence

of

twins, there are on average just 0.4 more children in twins-first households than in the
control group.

Notes: Each entry shows the change in probability of labor force participation of having twins rather
than a singleton in the first birth. Estimates of the impact of twins on the probability of labor force
participation are derived from probit estimates of the equation
LF = N + alagefb + azagefb2 + aqtwinsl + e,
where the LF takes the value 1 if the woman is in the labor force, agefb is age at first birth, and
twins 1 takes the value 1 if the individual experienced twins in the first birth and O otherwise, and e is
an error term. Standard errors are in parentheses.

Impact of twins is derived from Ordinary Least Squares regression estimates of the following equation:
Income = aO+ alagefb + azagefb2 + a~twins1 + e
where Income is the sum of wage, salary, and self-employment income reported for the year preceding the
census, agefb is the woman’s age at first birth, twins 1 takes the value 1 if the first birth resulted in twins and O
if the first birth was a singleton, and e is an error term. The equation was estimated for all women who reported
a positive number of weeks workded during the previous year.

Impact of twins is derived from Ordinary Least Squares regression estimates of the following
equation:
Wage = ~ + alagefb + a2agefb2 + agtwins1 + e
where Wage is the hourly wage imputed by dividing income reported for the previous year by an
estimate of annual hours worked obtained by multiplying weeks worked in the previous year by the
number of hours reported worked in the week before the census, agefb is the woman’s age at first
birth, twinsl takes the value 1 if the first birth resulted in twins and O if the first birth was a
singleton, and e is an error term. The equation was estimated for all women who reported a positive
number of hours and weeks worked.
