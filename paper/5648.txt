AND EVIDENCE

ABSTRACT

We arguethatstrategicinteractionsbetween firms in an oligopoly can explain the puzzling
lack of high-powered incentivesin executive compensationcontractswrittenby shareholderswhose
objective is to maximize the value of their shares. We derive the optimal compensation contracts
for managers and demonstratethatthe use of high-powered incentives will be limited by the need
to soften product marketcompetition. In particular,when managerscan be compensated based on
theirown and theirrivals’ performance,we show thattherewill be an inverse relationshipbetween
the magnitude of high-powered incentives and the degree of competition in the industry. More
competitive industriesarecharacterizedby weakerpay-performanceincentives. Empirically,we find
strongevidence of this inverserelationshipin the compensation of executives in the United States.
Our econometric resultsare not consistent with alternativetheories of the effect of competition on
executive compensation. We conclude thatstrategicconsiderations can preclude the use of highpowered incentives, in contrastto the predictions of the standardprincipal-agentmodel.

Introduction

The separation of ownership and control of large corporations is a central feature of modern
economies. The largely unobserved choice of actions by a firm’s managers can have a major
impact on the wealth of its shareholders. The literature on principal-agent theory suggests
that the primary means for the shareholders to ensure that managers take optimal actions
is to tie managers’ pay to the performance of their firms; that is, to provide high-powered
intent ives for managers to maximize the returns to shareholders. However, the empirical
literature has not found evidence of high-powered incentives. Instead, the typical finding is
a low pay-performance sensitivity, which seems to imply that shareholders are not providing
managers with incentives to maximize the returns to shareholders.
In this paper, we argue that strategic interactions between firms in an oligopoly can explain the puzzling lack of high-powered incentives in executive compensation contracts written by shareholders whose objective is to maximize the value of their shares. We derive the
optimal compensation contracts for managers and demonstrate that the use of high-powered
incentives will be limited by the need to soften product market competition.

In particu-

lar, when managers can be compensated based on their own and their rivals’ performance,
we show that there will be an inverse relationship between the magnitude of high-powered
incentives and the degree of competition in the industry. More competitive industries are
characterized by weaker pay-performance incentives. Empirically, we find strong evidence of
this inverse relationship in the compensation of executives in the United States.
We conclude that strategic considerations can preclude the use of high-powered incentives, in contrast to the predictions of the standard principal-agent model.

That model

posits an economic trade-off between inducing the correct amount of unobservable effort by
the agent and minimizing the amount of risk she is required to bear. In practice, that model

1

predicts that managerial compensation will be correlated with the total return to shareholders, typically through ownership of shares of the firm’s stock or grants of options on the
fire’s stock. In a seminal article, Jensen and Murphy (1990) test and reject this theoretical
prediction, finding that the compensation of chief executive officers increased by ody $3.25
They hypothesize that political forces (e.g.,

per $1,000 increase in shareholder wealth.1

societal notions of fairness and equity) work to reduce the pay-performance sensitivity.2
This contrasts with our explanation that the pay-performance sensitivity is low because a
high pay-performance sensitivity would induce overly aggressive behavior in the product
markets.
Another prediction of the principal-agent model of executive compensation is that pay
should be based not only on the returns to the firm’s shareholders but on every variable that
provides unique information about the actual action taken by the manager.3

A prominent

example of such a variable is the profits of other firms in the same product market, leading
to a compensation contract based on the relative performance of the manager compared to
her rivals. The prediction from the relative performance evaluation model is that, other
things equal, an executive will receive lower compensation if executives of rival fires deliver
higher returns to their shareholders. In our model, the validity of this prediction depends on
the nature of strategic competition. When the returns to attenuating competition are high,
compensation contracts will not exhibit relative performance evaluation. When the returns
to achieving product market leadership are high, contracts will have incentives that resemble

of the principal-agent

relative performance evaluation. The empirical literature on whether relative performance
evaluation is an important source of managerial incentives finds mixed results.4 We do not
find evidence in support of relative performance evaluation in our empirical work.
The lack of empirical confirmation is a consequence of the absence of strategic considerations from the standard principal-agent model, with or without relative performance
evaluation. With few exceptions, the typical principal-agent model fails to recognize that
the interaction between shareholders and managers occurs in an environment of strategic
interactions between firms in imperfectly competitive markets.5

A model that considers

compensation divorced from competition is incomplete. We show that when the optimal contract allows compensation to vary with own and industry performance, strategic interactions
support relative performance pay—a negative relationship between executive compensation
and industry performanc=nly

when firm outputs are strategic substitutes, as in the stan-

dard Cournot model.
When outputs are strategic complements, as in the differentiated Bertrand model of
price competition, relative performance pay lowers the shareholders’ returns by encouraging
more aggressive price setting by managers and is therefore not observed in equilibrium. In
this case, the level of compensation under the optimal contract incremes with both own
and industry performance, softening competition and raising the returns to shareholders.

Furthermore, the differentiated Bertrand model generates the strong prediction that the optimal compensation contract is sensitive to the degree of substitutability in the firm’s product
market. In more competitive industries, managers are given weaker incentives to maximize
returns to their own fires’ shareholders and stronger incentives to maximize returns to all
firms in the industry. Specifically, we show that the differentiated Bertrand model predicts
that the ratio of the own-firm pay-performance sensitivity to the industry pay-performance
sensitivity is a decreasing function of the level of competition in the industry.
We test our predictions by linking together two sources of data. We use industry concentration ratios from the Census of Manufactures to characterize product market competition
and compensation data for executives of large corporations from the Standard and Poor’s
ExecuComp dataset.

The prediction for the differentiated Bertrmd model is cotimed

empirically under a variety of econometric specificat iom. Our empirical results do not support the standard principal-agent model, the relative performance evaluation model, or the
Cournot model that we derive.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we derive the form of optimal executive
compensation contracts under differentiated Bertrand competition when contracts can vary
with own and industry performance. In section 3, we repeat the analysis under the assump
tion that competition is Cournot. In section 4, we demonstrate that in our model the optimal
contract is invariant to managerial risk aversion. In section 5, we describe the data that we
use for our empirical tests and, in section 6, present those findings. Section 7 discusses
the implications of our empirical resdts for alternative theories of executive compensation.
Section 8 concludes.

Bertrand Competition

We consider the following contracting model. There me two firms in an industry, 1 and 2,
who engage in differential ed Bertrand competition.

The model has two stages. At stage

1, the owners of the firms write contracts with the managers, and at stage 2 the managers
engage in differentiated Bertrand competition.G
stage 2 is unobservable.

We assume a manager’s action choice at

are observable, so contracts can be made contingent only on profits. Firm face symmetric

DQ(pl, p2) =

A–@2+ap1+&

bpl +ap2 +E

e is a mean zero shock to demand with variance 02. Therefore, prices cannot be perfectly
inferred from profits. We resume that b > a. That is, the manager’s action choice has a
greater impact on the demand for her own product than does her rival’s action. We assume
linear demands and two firms because this specification yields straightforward comparative
statics across product markets. The rmults of our model will generalize to industries with
more than two firms and to nonlinear demand functions so long as ~

< 0, ~

> 0, and

1*1>*At stage 1, if contracts are written contingent solely on own firm profits, we get the
standard differentiated Bertrand result. A contract that is increasing in own profits will
induce the manager to choose the profit maximizing price. If marginal cost is given by c, we
have the following program for the manager:

Symmetric equations hold for firm 2. We can then calculate profits under this standard
differentiated Bertrand model (which we do in the proof of Proposition 1).
The question we wish to ask is, can the standard contract be improved upon? Would
the owner of firm 1 raise her profits by offering the manager a contract contingent upon the
rival firm’s profits = well as the own firm’s profits? Suppose the following contract is offered
to the manager of firm 1:
WI = kl + O!ml+ prz

where
mi=(pi–

c)(A–bpi+apj+

(6)

In this model, the owner of firm 1 chooses the contract, the contract is revealed to both
managers, and then the managers choose pric~. We ~sume that the manager of firm 1 has
a reservation wage w! and that the managerial labor market is competitive. Therefore, the
manager of firm 1 is always held to her reservation wage. The first period program for the
owner of firm 1 is:

The first constraint is the manager’s individual rationality constraint, which will always bind
through the choice of kl, the fixed payment in the managerial incentive contract. The second
constraint ensures that the manager’s second period action choice is optimal given the first
period contract.
We start by analyzing the second period action choice of firm 1‘s manager in the differentiated Bertrand game. Explicitly, the manager’s problem is:

that fim 1 would like to w-rite a contract based on both firms’ profits

and that firm 2 benefits when firm 1 dom so. Next we establish that firm 2 would like to
offer its manager an analogous contract. We continue to consider linear contracts of the
following form:
(16)

We put no restrictions on a, ~, 6 or ~; they could be greater than 1 or less than O. We assume
each manager has a reservation wage, w~ and w~, and that the managerial labor market is
competitive. Therefore, the k’s, which are constants, are chosen so that the managers ae
always held to their reservation wages. The first period program for the owner of firm 1 is:
(17)

where the constraints are w given in program 7,
We start by analyzing the manager’s second period action choice in the differentiated
Bertrand game, which is the same problem we malyzed before for firm 1. As in program 8,
the manager’s problem is:

mP~

~(PI – c)(A – bPI + apz + E) + ~(pz – c)(A – bpz + apl + s).

As above, fim 1’s reaction function is
pl =

and a symmetric equation holds for firm 2. The optimal price levels as functions of a, ~, 6
and ~ are:

–4~b2a + aa2y + aa26 + ~a2~ + ~a26

Substituting the price choices back into the owners’ first period problems and holding
the managers to their reservation wages yields the following program for firm 1:

A similar program holds for firm 2. Jointly solving both gives the continuum of optimal
contracts for each firm’s manager, which is:

We can now solve for the symmetric equilibrium prices, p~:

Proposition 2 compares expected prices and profits in the cme where both managers
can be compensated on own and rival-firm profits to the case where only firm

1‘s

manager

can be compensated on own and rival-firm profits and to the case where both managers are
compensated strictly on their own-firm profits.

Figure 1 depicts the shift in equilibrium as we move from standard differentiated Bertrand
competition to competition characterized by compensation contracts based on own and rivalfirm profits. The upward sloping lines labelled pl and p2 are firm 1 and firm 2’s reaction
functions under standard differentiated Bertrand competition. The lines labelled p; and pj
are the reactions functions when managers can be compensated on both own and rival-firm
profits. In the new equilibrium, prices (p;, P;) are higher relative to standard differentiated
Bertrand competition.
Allowing a manager to be compensated on the rival firm’s profits lessens competition
and raises profits for both firms. Notice that the optimal contracts we derived,

are functions of a and b. The relative weight put on own firm’s profits in the optimal contract
is an increasing function of b, or the weight on own price, and a decreasing function of a, or the
weight on the rival firm’s price. The ratio b/a measures the degree of substitutability between
the two firm’s products.

A higher value of b/a indicates lower substitutability, i.e., an

10

industry that is closer to a monopoly. A lower value of b/a indicates greater substitutability,
i.e., an industry that is closer to perfect competition.
The optimal contracts are only identified up to their ratio, a*/~*, and not to their levels.
This is a result of the continuum of equilibria. We call this ratio the

compensation

ratio.

As

the product market approaches a monopoly, that is

(22)

the optimal contract puts all of the weight on own-firm performance and none on rival-firm
performance. As the product market approaches the perfectly competitive outcome,

limg=l,
a~b ~%

(23)

the weights on both own firm and rival firm become equalized in the optimal contract. In
other words, as the products become more substitutable, more weight is put on the rival
firm’s profits to offset the increased competitive pressure.
The next step in the analysis is to consider the situation in which the principal allows
the agent to choose her contract. For example, the principal pays the agent a fixed amount
of money and allows her to allocate the funds (or some fraction thereof) between the stock
of her own firm and her rival firm. In other words we are considering the agent’s portfolio
problem and explicitly accounting for strategic effects on portfolio choice. Mathematically,
the agents now choose a, ~, 6 and ~. The problem for firm 1‘s owner is:

A symmetric problem holds for firm 2. k will be chosen so that the IR constraint is
met with equality. Therefore, we only need consider the agent’s problem. The information
structure here is important–the manager of firm 1 chooses her contract at the same time
that the manager of firm 2 chooses her contract, the contracts are revealed, and then the
firms compete (prices are chosen). Price competition yields the same prices w functions of
contracts as we derived for Proposition 2.

The manager of firm 1 chooses a and @ to maximize

given the prices above and symmetrically for the manager of firm 2. The symmetric equilibrium contracts are a“ = r, ,f3°= r, ~“ = t, 6“ = t,

r, t E R+. If we choose ~“ = ~“ (the

contract from Proposition 2), i.e., r = y, then
2b–a

(26)

Allowing the agent to choose the contract further softens price competition.

Given these

contracts, Proposition 3 shows that prices and profits are higher when the manager picks
her contract (or allocates her portfolio) than when the owner chooses the contract for the
manager.
Proposition

3 If ~~~] > c, then EM] > E~~]

and E[m~] > E[TT]

foT i E

[1,2].

Competition is further softened because now the managers fully internalize their competitive externality. Shareholders cannot commit directly to maximizing industry profits
12

because this is not credible-they can only commit to maximizing their own wealth. Letting
managers choose their contracts indirectly commits firms to maximizing industry profits.
Both managers choose contracts and then prices to mtimize

industry profitability, Because

prices are strategic complements, higher prices increase joint profits, which then increase the
manager’s payoff.
In summary, we might expect to see compensation contracts based on own and rivalfirm profits when firms engage in differentiated Bertrand competition. Relative to standard
differentiated Bertrand competition, such compensation contracts soften competition. However, firms do even better by allowing managers to allocate their wealth across the equity
of their own firms and their rivals. As long w managers hold some of the equity in their
own firm, they will also choose to hold equity in their rival and further attenuate Bertrand
competition. Thus, it is not a requirement to observe explicit provisions regarding own and
rival-firm profits in managerial contracts. The manager can be relied on to make optimal
portfolio allocations.

Cournot Competition

Now we consider the same model as before but where the market is characterized by Cournot
competition instead of Bertrand competition. The demand structure is:

D(ql, qz) = A – b(ql + qz) + &

(27)

The standard Cournot solution obtains if the manager is strictly compensated on own-firm
profits. It is given by:
mqy

Next we consider contracts contingent upon rival-firm profits M well as owr-firm profits.
First we look at the case in which only the manager of firm 1 is compensated on the rival
firm’s stock price in addition to her own share performance. We consider linear contracts of
the following form:
WI =

(32)

We also assume that contracts me bounded:
a,p

(33)

We now proceed as we did before in the Bertrand ewe. The first period program for the
owner of firm 1 is:

For firm 2, we have the standard Cournot reaction function:

Jointly solving both yields:

(38)

Substituting these quantity choices back into firm 1‘s owner’s first period problem and
holding the manager to her reservation wage gives the following program:

:7

E[q; (A – b(q; + q;) –

C+

E)] – u;.

(39)

The solution to this program is given in the following proposition:

E[T~~]

E[qi~l=
E[q;l] and E[m~~] = E[mjl]. Therefore, we have unique quantities and pagofls E[q{], E[n[],
E[q~] and E[n~]. Relative to the Coumot payofls and quantities we have E[q{] > E[ql],
E[n~] > EIzI], E[q~] < E[q2] and E[n~] < E[7rz].

This leads to firm 1 becoming a Stackelberg leader and firm 2 becoming a Stackelberg
follower. Profits are higher for firm 1 when its manager is compensated on both firms’ profits
than when she is compensated solely on own-firm profits. Note that the optimal contracts
15

can be decomposed into two types: those in which the manager of firm 1 is given a long
position in her own firm and a short position in the rival and those in which the manager
is given a short position in her own firm and a long position in the rival. While both
are theoretically possible, legal constraints prevent a manager from shorting her own firm.
Section 16(c) of the Securiti-

Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits insiders from maintaining

short positions in equity securities.7

Hansen and Lott (1995) demonstrate that no such

constraints exist on taking a short position in a rival firm. We thus refer to the contract in
which the manager of a firm is given a long position in her own firm and a short position in
her rival as the equilibrium contract.
Next we consider if firm 2 is better off by also adopting such a contract. The contract
specification is again linear:

The reaction functions are:

Substituting these quantity choices back into the owner’s first period problem and holding
the manager to her reservation wage yields the following program:

rn~

E[q; (A – b(q; + q;) + &– c)] – W;.

(44)

A similar program holds for firm 2. Jointly solving both gives the Nash equilibrium optimal
contracts for each firm’s manager.
Proposition
5 There are two continua of pure strategy asymmetric Nash equilibria. In
the first continuum, al* = r, @l* = –r, ~1” = t,61* = O, and r,t 6 [–M, O) u (O,M].
For all rk, Tl, t G [–M, O) U (O,M], E[q]~] = E[q~~], E[m~~] = E[~~;], E[q~~] = E[qj~] and
E[T~~] = E[n~~]. In the second continuum, a2* = u, ~2” = 0, ~2* = v, 62* = –v, and
U,V E [–M, O) U(O, M]. FOT a~luk,vl,u

E[q?~] = E[qfT],
E[~f~]

E[q~~] = E[q~~] and E[T~~] = E[~~~]. Therefore, we have unique quantities and payofls E[q~*],
E[~~*], E[q~*] and E[nfi*], e G {1,2} associated with each continuum of equilibria, In all of the
pure strategy Nash equilibria, one firrR is a Stackelberg leader and the other is a Stackelberg
follower. Joint quantities are higher and joint profits lower than in the standard Cournot
model.

17

As in the previous proposition, within each continuum we can decompose contracts into
two types: those in which the manager is given a long position in her own firm and a short
position in the rival and those in which the manager is given a short position in her own
firm and a long position in the rival. Again, we will refer to this first type of contract as
the equilibrium contract. The optimal contracts exhibit short-selling of the rival by one of
the fires, who becomes the Stackelberg leader; that is, either ~“ or 6* is negative. The
Stackelberg follower has a long position in her own firm and no position in the rival (this is
again the result of legal prohibitions against short selling of one’s own firm).
It is worth noting the differences between our results and those of Fershtman and Judd
(1987) and Skliv~ (1987). Fershtman and Judd and Sklivas consider contracts in which the
manager is compensated on a linear combination of own-firm profits and sales, and not on
rival-firm profits. They show that quantities are higher and profits are lower than in the
standard Cournot model. However, their models generate a unique equilibrium that does not
have Stackelberg behavior. Our model has continua of asymmetric pure strategy equilibria
in which the firms do exhibit Stackelberg behavior. Asymmetry is a natural feature of our
model and characterizes a richer set of possible outcomes for the Cournot c~e.
In our model, shorting one’s rival resembles relative performance evaluation. The manager does get compensated on the difference between her firm’s performance and that of
the rival firm. However, what looks like relative performance evaluation is not the result of
the owner’s need to provide the agent with incentives to supply effort while filtering out the
common shock 6. Instead, what appears to be relative performance evaluation arises because
the owner wants to toughen competition–it is a strategic choice rather than a response to
moral hazard.
Next we ask the question of whether the owner would prefer to let the manager choose

18

the contract, as we did in the Bertrand case. Again, this means the agents pick o, ~, 6 and
~. The problem for firm 1’s owner is:

A symmetric problem holds for firm 2. k will be chosen so that the IR constraint is met

firm 1 chooses her contract at the same time that the manager of firm 2 chooses her contract,
the contracts are revealed, and then the firms compete (quantities are chosen). Quantity
competition yields the same quantities as functions of contracts as we derived in equations

both managers take long positions in that firm. Clearly the owner of the firm that does
not produce is made worse off in this situation–such an owner would prefer not to let her
manager choose her own contract. On the other hand, each owner would like to induce her
manager to produce at the monopoly level. One way to achieve this is to give a manager a
sticiently

large stake in her own firm so that she cannot take an equally large long position

in her rival. In this case, the best the manager can do is to short her rival, thus committing
the manager to produce aggressively and to become either a monopolist (as in Proposition
6) or a Stackelberg leader (w in Proposition 5).

does not produce.

another continuum of equilibria. Firm 1 can choose any contract where a = z, ~ = –z and
get a monopoly position. Firm 2, by letting the manager choose, does not produce.
These cases demonstrate that there remains a strategic role for relative performance
evaluation. We expect to see both firms choosing contracts for their managers. This is
the situation analyzed in Proposition 5. One manager’s contract will consist of aggressively
short-selling the rival, i.e., there will be a contract that resembles relative performance
evaluation for that manager. The other firm will select a standard compensation contract
consisting of a long position in the manager’s own firm.

Risk Aversion

Thus far we have assumed that the manager is risk neutral. In this section, we show that
the analysis is unchanged if the manager is risk averse. This property is the consequence of
our assumption that there is no disutility to the agent’s action choices. To see this, recall
that throughout the paper, the principals have solved programs of the following form:

21

(50)

In order to show that risk aversion does not matter, we need only show that the optimal
action choice Zi does not change when the manager is risk averse. This is because the
principal is risk neutral in either case, and so a and ~ will be chosen optimally given Zi and
kl is chosen so WI = w;. The optimal z; in the problem above is given by the solution to:

We interpret a and @ w the fractions of shareholdings in firm 1 and 2 respectively for the

Data

The models of sections 2 and 3 yield testable implications regarding the relationship between
product substitutability and the sensitivity of executive compensation to firm performance.
We combine data from two separate sources to explore this relationship empirically. Our
data on compensation are drawn from the Standard and Poor’s Compustat ExecuComp
database. Our data on the product market substitutability across different firms are drawn
from the Censuses of Manufactures conducted by the Commerce department. This section
describes each of these data sources in turn.
23

5.1

Executive Compensation Data

The ExecuComp dataset compiled by Standard and Poor’s includes data on total compensation for the top five executives (ranked annually by salary and bonus) at each of the firms in
the S&P 500, S&P Midcap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600.9 In addition to measures of shortterm compensation such as salary and bonus, ExecuComp cent ains data on components
of long-term compensation such as long-term incentive plans, restricted stock, and stock
appreciation rights. Due to enhanced federal reporting requirements for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 1992, the ExecuComp data for 1993 and 1994 are virtually complete. 10
Relative to the dat=ets used in the studies by Jensen and Murphy (1990) and Gibbons and
Murphy (1990), the advantages of the ExecuComp data are that its sample encompmses the
largest 1500 fires each year and is not restricted to just chief executive officers. The main
disadvantage is that its panel dimension for payments to executives is limited to only two
years at present.
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics on the components of executive compensation for
all executiv= in the ExecuComp sample for 1994 for whom complete data on total compensation is available. The top panel of the table pertains to the 1,490 executives who are
identified as the chief executive officer of the fire. The bottom panel describes the other 6,146
executives in the sample. Our measure of total compensation can be divided into short-term
compensation and long-term compensation.

Short-term compensation consists of salary,

bonus, and other annual payments (e.g., gross-ups for tax liabilities, perquisites, preferential

CEOS and $454,000 for the Non-CEOs. Long-term compensation includes the value of restricted stock granted, stock options granted, payouts from long-term incentive plans, and all
other compensation (e.g., contributions to benefit plans, severance payments). The sample
averages of long-term compensation are $1,045,000 for CEOS and $381,000 for Non-CEOs.
In the aggregate, long-term compensation accounts for 51.8 percent of CEO compensation
and 45.6 percent of Non-CEO compensation. At the individual level, the average share of
compemation that is long-term is 35.0 percent for CEOS and 32.1 percent for Non-CEOs,
reflecting the skewness in the distribution of long-term compensation. Stock options granted
are by far the most important component of long-term compensation, accounting for 72.9
percent for CEOS and 68.8 percent for Non-CEOs.ll

5.2

Product Market Data

Our model links the compensation contract to properties of the demand curve for a firm’s
products. Specifically, in the differentiated Bertrand model from Section 2 with linear demand curves, the compensation contract is a fiction

of the ratio b/a, where the numerator

(denominator) is the slope of the demand curve with respect to the firm’s (rival’s) price. A
firm in an industry in which there is little product differentiation will have a low ratio. Our
theory predicts that the compensation of executives in such an industry will be insensitive
to

changes in own performance relative to rival firm performance. Compensation becomes

more sensitive to own-firm performance relative to rival-firm performance as product differentiation (and the ratio b/a) increases.
Since we do not have estimates of the parameters of demand functions at the level of the

firm or even the industry, we proxy for the degree of substitutability that a firm’s product
faces with the firm’s industry concentration ratio. We conjecture that a firm in a more
concentrated industry will have fewer close substitutes for its products. This assumption is
consistent with a framework such as that of Salop (1979), in which firms in each industry
have located optimally in the product space to maximize the distance between competitors.
In such a model, industries with more firms will have greater product substitutability and
lower concentration ratios.
Our source of data on concentration ratios by industry is the 1992 Census of Manufactures, conducted by the Bureau of the Census as part of the quinquennial Economic
Censuses.12

Within the manufacturing sector are the twenty 2-digit standard industrial

classification (SIC) codes from 20 to 39, and within these 2-digit SICS are 458 separate 4digit SICS (ranging from 2001 to 3999). For each SIC, the Census contains five measures of
industry concentration: the 4, 8-, 20-, and 50-fim ratios and the Herfindahl index. Denoting a firm’s share of the total value of shipments in the industry by (i and ordering the firms
from the largest share to smallest, an industry’s Herfindahl index is:

The restriction of the Herfindahl to the largest 50 firms is a convention of the Census of

Each cell in the table weights the concentration ratio of the

constituent 4-digit SICS in proportion to their value of shipments. There is wide variation in
average concentration across these broad industry groups. In our empirical work, we use the
Herfindahl index as our measure of industry concentration, although our qualitative results
are invariant to the particular measure of concentration that we use. We believe that the
Herfindahl best captures the impact of both the number of firms and their relative market
shares on the degree of product substitutability in an industry.
It is worth noting that although we use the concentration ratio m a prow for the substitutability of products between firms in a market, the correspondence between SIC codes
and product markets is not perfect. Even at the 4-digit level, some industries may include
several products that are not themselves close substitutes for each other. This aggregation
tends to understate the true concentration ratio for a firm’s product, possibly by different
amounts in different industry classifications. This consideration must be balanced against
another data limitation; namely, that many firms have products in several 4-digit industries,
but the firm’s top executives are typically responsible for all of them, and the firm’s financial
statements reflect its overall performance. Conducting the analysis with more disaggregated
industry classifications would exacerbate this problem. 14

Empirical Results

Our model specifies executive compensationm

a linear combination of own and rival-firm

profits:

WI = kl + anl + ~7rz

(56)

Note that Q and ~ also represent the own and rival-firm pay-performance sensitivities in this
linear compensation contract. The main prediction from the differentiated Bertrand model
is that the relative weight of own profits relative to rival firm profits-the compensation ratio
(a/~) -should be a decreasing function of the degree of substitutability between the two firms’
products. In other words, M products become more substitutable (markets become more
competitive), an executive’s pay will depend less on her own firm’s performance and more
on the performance of rival firms. In contrast, the main prediction of the Cournot model is
that executive compensation hm a constant own-firm pay-performance sensitivity regardless
of the degree of competition in the product market. In this framework, a is positive and @
is negative or zero. To the extent that rival firms’ performance matters, better rival firm
performance decreases executive compensation.
As discussed above, we make two simplifying assumptions to test our theory empirically.
The first is that the firm’s rivals are the set of firms who also have their principal business
in the same 4-digit SIC code (Below, we will also consider more aggregated industrial classifications at the 3- and 2-digit levels). The second is that the degree of substitutability in a
firm’s product market can be proxied by the concentration of the firm’s industry. In order
to estimate pay-performance sensitivities, we specify both parameters of the compensation

28

concentration ratios:

where F(H) is the empirical curntiative distribution function (calf) of the Herfindahl index
across 4-digit SICS. F(H)

will equal zero (one) at the minimum (maximum) observed

industry concentrations in our sample. 15 We use the cdf of H as a

convenient

normalization

that allows for e~y interpretation of the parameters, ~k, in a regression specification. Note
that when the firm’s rivals are alternatively defined m all firms within the same 3- or 2-digit
SICS, we continue to use the Herfindahl for the 4-digit SIC to characterize the degree of
product substitutability the firm faces.
Given the equations in 57, the Cournot model m~es

the strong prediction that in a

cross-section of industries: ql >0, q2 <0, and q3 = 7j14

the Bertrand model will be empirically confirmed if the compensation ratio is an incre~ing
function of the Herfindahl index:

where ~(H) is the probability density function associated with F(H).

Since f(H)

of relative performance evaluation typically include ~~t – n~~as an explanatory variable
in a regression for compensation.

We extend that framework first by including the two

components separately and, second, by allowing both pay-performance sensitivities to vary
across industries in proportion to their concentration ratio. Accordingly, we estimate the
following equation:

In this equation, the executive ‘i’ works at firm ‘j’ in year ‘t.’ The dependent variable
is compensation (in constant 1994 dollars), and the first four independent variables are own
and rival firm performance, alone and interacted with the cdf of the Herfindahl index. The
31

regressions also include the cdf of the Herfindahl itself and an indicator variable that is
equal to one if the executive is a CEO and zero otherwise. The remaining terms, denoted
by ~j~t, are indicator variables for whether fim ‘j’ is in the 2-digit SIC ‘k’ in year ‘t. ’17
The inclusion of these indicator variables ensures that it is not the variation in the average pay-performance sensitivities between 2-digit industry groups but the variation in the
pay-performance sensitivity within those groups that identifies the estimated coefficient. Including the industry effects also controls for any other factor such as a macroeconomic shock
that varies across broad industry groups but not within the narrow industries that comprise
them. Note that we cannot estimate the model with a more disaggregated fixed effect (e.g.,
at the level of the firm or the executive) because our memure of the Herfindahl index does
not vary across executives in a given firm or over the two years of data in the sample.
Table 3a presents the estimates of equation 65 with total compensation as the dependent
variable. In all specifications, executive compensation is denominated in thousands and firm
performance is denominated in millions of constant 1994 dollars. The fist column pertains
to a regression in which the firm’s rivals are all other firms in the sample with the same 4digit SIC code. The first coefficient shows that an executive’s total compensation incremes
by 0.11 cents for every thousand dollars of incremental shareholder wealth per year in an
industry that hm the minimum industry concentration (i.e., the one for which F(H) = Oand
is therefore the most competitive).

The third coefficient shows that this pay-performance

sensitivity increases by another 7.92 cents per thousand as industry concentration incremes
from the least to the most concentrated. Thus, the pay-performance sensitivity is 8.03 cents
per thousand at the maximum industry concentration (i.e., the one for which F(H) = l)).
The second and fourth coefficients show that the rival pay-performance sensitivity is 32.66

cents per thousand in the least concentrated (i.e., most competitive) industries and declines
to 32.66 – 34.10 = – 1.44 cents per thousand in the most concentrated (i.e., least competitive)
industries. The rival pay-performance sensitivity changes from positive to negative at the
96th percentile of the Herfindahl index distribution. As shown in the table, at the median
industry concentration, the own pay-performance sensitivity is 0.11 + 0.50 * 7.92 = 4,07 cents
per thousand and the rival pay-performance sensitivity is 32.66 – 0.50* 34.10 = 15.61 cents
per thousand.

In their estimates of the pay-performance sensitivity, Jensen and Murphy

(1990) found that for total compensation, the pay-performance sensitivity was 3.29 cents
per thousand.la

The result that the rival pay-performance sensitivity is positive rather

than negative over almost the entire distribution of industries is inconsistent with models
such as Gibbons and Murphy (1990) which emphasize relative performance evaluation. This
result also contradicts the predictions of the Cournot model that we derived in section 3.
Although our model abstracts from all other factors that might cause one executive to
be paid more than another, in actual data we have to allow for these factors. In addition
to the full set of 2-digit industry and year interactions, we also include the percentile of
the Herfindahl index itself and a dummy variable that takes on a value of one if the executive is a CEO and zero otherwise. Including the cdf of the Herfindahl allows for the level
of compensation to be different in more concentrated industries, independent of own and
rival performmce.

The fifth row in the table shows that total compensation incremes by

approximately $38,000 for every decile incre~e in the distribution of the Herfindahl index.
Including the indicator variable is motivated by the differences in the level (more so than in
the composition) of executive compensation revealed in Table 1. The last coefficient shows

that CEOS receive approximately $1 million more in total compensation than do non-CEOs,
a number that is similar to the unconditional difference shown in Table 1.
The bottom panel of the table presents the tests of the nonlinear restriction on the parameters {ql, q2, q3, q4} specified as R (q) >0 that is implied by our differentiated Bertrand
model. In the first entry, where the value of F(H) is set equal to 0.25, the value of the restriction is 0.4504 and the test statistic is 15.4154. Since the test statistic is asymptotically
distributed chi-square with one degree of freedom, the null hypothesis that the compensation
ratio is not increasing with H is strongly rejected with a p-value of 0.0001. The null hypothesis is similarly rejected for F(H)
for F(H)

= 0.50 and rejected at the 4 percent significance level

= 0.75. The higher p-values at higher percentiles indicate that we can have less

confidence that the compensation ratio is still increasing with respect to industry concentration once industries have become highly concentrated. The strong results for the hypothesis
tests can be traced to the pattern of signs on the estimates for {ql, q2, q3, q~}. A sticient
but not necessary condition for R (q) >0 to obtain is that qd be negative and ql, qz, and qa
be positive. This condition will result in ~

>0 and ~

<0, which in turn will guarantee

that the compensation ratio is increasing in H.
The second and third columns of Table 3a extend the definition of the rival firms to
those in the same 3-digit and 2-digit SICS, respectively. The second column shows that
when the 3-digit SIC is used, the parameter estimates, median pay-performance sensitivities,
and hypothesis tests are similar in magnitude and significance to those in the 4-digit SIC
specification.

The third column shows that when the 2-digit SIC is used, q3 is negative

(though with only marginal significance). Given the magnitudes of the other parameters,
this is enough to make the restriction on the own and rival-firm pay-performance sensitivities
insignificantly negative rather than significantly positive. It is not surprising that the model

34

fails under such a broad definition of the firm’s rivals. It is unlikely that strategic interactions
between firms are as important at the 2-digit level as they are at the narrower 4-digit level.lg

Table 3b presents the estimates of the same three regressions using short-term compensation as the dependent variable. The results are very similar to those in Table 3a. When
the rivals are defined at the 4-digit or 3-digit SIC level, the ndl hypothesis that the compensation ratio does not increase with industry concentration is strongly rejected. Unlike
the regressions for total compensation, there is no industry concentration level at which the
rival-firm pay-performance sensitivity is negative. At the median industry concentration,
the own and rival-firm pay-performance sensitivities are 3.21 and 4.11 cents per thousand,
respectively, for the 4-digit SIC rivals and 3.19 md 5.23 cents per thousand for 3-digit SIC
rivals. These results are somewhat higher than Jensen and Murphy’s (1990) range of estimates from 1.35 to 2.19 cents per thousand for salary plus bonus. When the definition of
rivals is extended to the 2-digit SIC level, the restriction value is again negative though not
statistically significant.
The skewness of the distribution of many of the components of executive compensation
documented in Table 1 raises the possibility that the results in Table 3 are being unduly
influenced by outliers. Tables 4a and 4b estimate the same specifications from Tables 3a
and 3b using median regression. Because median regression minimizes the sum of absolute
deviations rather than the sum of squared deviations, it is less sensitive to outliers than is
ordinary le=t squares. Using this method, the estimates for each of the six specifications
provide stronger support for the predictions of our differentiated Bertrand model: all of
the test statistics are positive and significant below the 0.1 percent significance level, in191tis noteworthythat GibbonsandMurphy(1990)found

eluding those for the 2-digit SIC definition of rivals, which were previously negative and
insignificant.20 The parameter estimates for {ql, q2, q3, q4} are typically more positive than
in Table 3, resulting in higher values of the own pay-performance sensitivity. At the median
industry concentration, own and rival pay-performance sensitivities are 8.44 and 12.20 cents
per thousand for the 4-digit SICS for total compensation. They are 5.61 and 5.20 cents per
thousand for short-term compensation. The median regressions estimate smaller effects for
the CEO and the industry concentration variables. Thus, the main results from the OLS
regressions are supported and strengthened by the median regressions.
The optimal contracts based on the parameter estimates for the 4-digit and 3-digit SIC
specifications from Table 4 are graphed in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. In each graph, the
horizontal axis represents F(H) and the vertical axis represents the regression estimate of
the compensation ratio:

for both total and short-term compensation. Each of the four curves is upward sloping, as
predicted by the differentiated Bertrand model. In both figures, the total compensation ratio
varies more with industry concentration than does the short-term compensation ratio.21 The
greater sensitivity of the total compensation ratio to industry concentration suggests that
shareholders rely more on long-term compensation to accommodate strategic interactions
and that the incentive effects of long-term compensation are greater than those of shortterm compensation.

In Tables 3 and 4, we have constrained the own and rival-firm pay-performance sensitivities to be equal for CEOS and non-CEOs, allowing only their average level of compensation to
differ. In Tables 5 and 6, we relax that assumption and estimate the same set of regressions
restricting the sample to only CEOS. The results are qualitatively the same w in the full
sample of executives, with larger magnitudes on all of the coefficients. The pay-performance
sensitivities will be higher in the sample of CEOS because they bear more responsibility for
decisions within the firm that affect own profits and within the industry that affect rival
profits. B~ed on the OLS estimation for total compensation, reported in Table 5a, the
own and rival pay-performance sensitivities at the median industry concentration are 3.10
and 40.34 cents per thousand for 4-digit SICS and 10.50 and 38.44 cents per thousand for
3-digit SICS. B~ed on the median regressions (Table 6a), the median own and rival payperformance sensitivities are 7.25 and 41.17 cents per thousand for 4-digit SICS and 7.45
and 41.03 cents per thousand for 3-digit SICS. Thus, the main difference between the estimates for CEOS and those for the full sample is a higher rival pay-performance sensitivity,
not a higher own pay-performance sensitivity
y. The tests of the restriction implied by the
differentiated Bertrand model are similar to those in the full sample but offer weaker statistical evidence. For the 4-digit and 3-digit SIC specifications, the restriction value is always
positive, but it is statistically significant in the OLS regressions only at median industry
concentration or below. The test still rejects the null hypothesis at a significance level below
ten percent in the corresponding median regressions.
Throughout our theoretical and empirical work, we have limited our me~ure of total
compensation to the annual flow of resources that the shareholders could have kept for
themselves had they not used it to compensate the executive. In practice, m executive also
receives incentives from the effects of her actions on the value of her holdings of stock in

37

her own firm and in her rival firms. If an executive owns stock in her firm, then the total
increme in her wealth due to the performance of her firm will include not only the extra
pay she receives as part of the pay-performance sensitivity built into her compensation but
Recognizing this, the shareholders of

the appreciation on her personal stock holdings .22

her firm will incorporate a lower own-firm pay-perfomance

sensitivity into her contract. If

the manager’s holdings of her rival firms’ stock were also known, then her compensation
contract would include a lower rival-firm pay-performance sensitivity as well.
The consequences of an executive’s personal wealth holdings are straightforward in our
framework. The optimal compensation contract becomes a function of both the degree of
substitutability in the product market and the executive’s holdings of her own firm and her
rivals. Conditional on a particular allocation of the executive’s personal wealth, however,
the relationship between product substitutability and the compensation ratio takes the same
form as in the model of section 2.
In order for our econometric specifications to remain valid, we would have to control for
the executive’s holdings of her own and rival firms. Since it is impossible to obtain data on
the executive’s holdings of her rival firms, we cannot modify our regressions in this way.23
In order to test for the robustness of our tidings

to the incentives provided by inside

ownership, we stratify our sample into two groups of executives: those who had less than
the median wealth in their own firm at the beginning of the sample year and those who had
more than the median. We then run the regressions from Table 3a separately for each group

The results of these regressions for the 4-digit SIC and 3-digit SIC specifications are
presented in Table 7. The bottom panel shows that the null hypothesis, that the restriction
implied by the differentiated Bertrand model is not satisfied, is rejected at significance levels
below five percent at the 25th percentile of industry concentration. The null hypothesis is
rejected at significance levels of approximately ten percent or below at the median concentration. At the 75th percentile, the restriction value is always positive, but the p-values are
approximately 0.30 for the low ownership sample and 0.20 for the high ownership sample.
Thus, if the model had been tested only on these smaller groups, it would still be largely
supported by the data. More importantly, the middle panel shows that the comparison of
the compensation ratios across the two groups supports the predictions of the model. The
compensation ratio is higher in the subsample of executives who have low holdings of their
own firms. In the 4-digit SIC specification, the ratio is 1.5441 in the low ownership group
and 0.1080 in the high ownership group.

In the 3-digit SIC specification, the ratios are

1.1643 and 0.1996.
The results presented in Table 7 support the differentiated Bertrand model in two distinct ways. First, the compensation ratio is increasing in both the low ownership and high
ownership subsamples.

Second, the compensation ratio itself is greater in the low own-

ership group than in the high ownership group. In the high ownership group, executives
already receive high-powered incentives from their own personal stock holdings. They have
a correspondingly lower compensation ratio. We conclude that the empirical confirmation
of the predictions from our differentiated Bertrand model are robust to the omission of the
executive’s personal wealth from the model.

39

The regressions of executive compensation on firm performance in Tables 3 through 6
provide strong empirical support for the differentiated Bertrand model derived in section 2.
Under the assumption that the Herfindahl index for a fire’s 4-digit SIC is an appropriate
proxy for the degree of product substitutability, our results show that the sensitivity of
compensation to own performance relative to rival performance decreases with the degree
of product substitutability. Based on these restits, we conclude that strategic interactions
have important effects on the structure of executive compensation.

7.
In

Discussion
our model, compensation contracts are used to influence the nature of competition–in the

case of Bertrand competition, to soften it. There are two major strands in the literature that
consider the effects of competition on the nature of optimal contracts. The first literature
examines the effects of product market competition on agency problems, and the second
literature analyzes the importance of competition for relative performmce evaluation.
The research of Hart (1983), Scharfstein (1988), and Hermalin (1992) considers whether
or not market competition induces managers to run their firms more efficiently by increasing
their supply of effort. Hart (1983) assumes that the manager’s utility is infinitely negative
below a certain income threshold. This implies that the manager is paid a fixed wage if
she achieves a certain profit target. In equilibrium, when competition increases, firm profits
and the manager’s wage are constant and the manager’s effort increases. The first empirical
prediction is that the own-firm pay-performance sensitivity is positive (ql + qa~(~)

> O).

This prediction is borne out by the data. Second, there is no cross-sectional correlation
between industry concentration and the manager’s own-firm pay-performance sensitivity
(qs = O). This prediction is usually rejected in our empirical work.

40

Third, there is no

correlation between the manager’s compensation and rival firm performance (qz + q~~(~) =
O). This prediction receives no empirical support in our data.
Scharfstein (1988) allows the manager to be risk averse (but not infinitely so) and derives
the optimal contracts when a productivity parameter is hidden information. In his model,
managerial effort, firm profits, and compensation m a share of profits all decrease when competition increases. Notice that this model implies that managerial effort will decrease (not
increase) in response to an increase in competition, the opposite of Hart’s (1983) result. Our
empirical results support three cross-sectional predictions of this model: that the own-firm
pay-performance sensitivity is positive (ql + q3F(H) > O), that this sensitivity is increasing
with industry concentration (q3 > O), and that the level of compensation is increasing with
industry concentration (q5 > O). Scharfstein’s model provides no predictions regarding the
rival-firm pay-performance sensitivity. It is therefore silent on two of our more robust findings; namely, that the rival-firm pay-performance sensitivity is positive (q2 + q4F(H) > O)
and increming with the degree of product market competition (q4 < O). Thus, Scharfstein’s
model cannot fully explain our empirical restits. 24
The relative performance evaluation literature, particularly the work of Lazear and Rosen
(1981), Holrnstrom (1982), and Gibbons and Murphy (1990), shows that a risk-averse manager’s compensation should be insulated from common industry-wide shocks to profits. Relative performance evaluation filters out the common shock by placing a negative weight on
rival firm’s performance. This is true for evaluation of both effort and ability. For effort,
relative performance evaluation allows the principal to infer the agent’s effort choic~this is

and infer the agent’s ability. Our finding of a significant and positive coefficient on rival
firm’s performance when explaining executive compensation is clearly inconsistent with the
predictions of the relative performance evaluation literature.

8.

Conclusion

We have derived the optimal contracts in a principal-agent model of strategic competition in
which managers can be compensated on both their own profits and their rival’s (or industry)
profits.

We demonstrate that when competition is differentiated Bertrand, the optimal

contract compensates the manager positively on both own and rival-firm performance. This
contract has the effect of softening competition. We show that the fraction of compensation
based on rival firm performance is increasing in the degree of competition in the industry.
The need to soften competition is highest in those industries that are most competitive. In
this case, relative performance evaluation, the natural consequence of the principal-agent
framework, would lower returns to shareholders.
When competition is Cournot, the optimal contract compensates the manager positively
on own-firm performance and negatively on rival-firm performance. This contract intensifies competition and leads to one firm achieving Stackelberg leadership and the other firm
becoming a Stackelberg follower. Such contracts look very much like relative performance
evaluation, but the impetus for their use comes from the nature of competition, not an
agency problem.
Our empirical findings are consistent with the predictions from our differentiated Bertrand
model and are inconsistent with the predictions from a standard principal-agent model, a
relative performance evaluation model, and our model of Cournot competition.

42

Firms op-

crating in product markets that are more competitive rely less on high-powered incentives
to compensate their managers than do firms in less competitive industries. More generally,
the magnitude of own-firm pay-performance sensitivity is explicitly linked to the magnitude of the rival-firm pay-performance sensitivity
y. Thus, what is import ant for executive
compensation and incentives is the ratio of the pay-performance sensitivities, not the absolute magnitude of either. That only this compensation ratio is identified may provide an
explanation for the widely observed low own-firm pay-performance sensitivity.
Our theoretical and empirical work also provides an explanation of the Jensen and Murphy (1990) finding that relative performance pay is not an important source of managerial
incentives. If managerial decisions are strategic complements, then relative performance pay
induces managers

have limited interaction with CEOS in rival firms, sabotage and collusive shirking seem unlikely” (p. 31-S). We start from a different premise; namely, that the nature of oligopolistic
competition makes executives in rival firms interact in ways that are fundamental to the objectives of the firms’ shareholders. As Gibbons and Murphy go on to note, “Paying workers
based on relative performance instead of absolute performance distorts the worker’s incentives whenever the worker can take actions that affect the average output of the reference
group” (p. 34-S). In our framework, pay based on relative performance would give the executive an incentive to price too aggressively in a differentiated Bertrand model, opposing
the shareholders’ objectives to soften competition.

The Gibbons and Murphy result that

CEO performance is more likely to be evaluated relative to agg-regate market movements
than to industry movements is consistent with our model. Valu&maximizing shareholders do
not give their executives strong incentives to outperform their most immediate competition.
Within narrow industries, product market considerations are likely to dominate considerations of relative performance. To the extent that shareholders provide insurance to their
executives as dictated by the standard principal-agent model, they rely more heavily on
benchmarks that do not interfere with strategic competition.
Finally, we believe that a model of executive compensation that incorporates product
market considerations can help to answer an outstanding question in the literature on incentives. In “A Survey of Corporate Governance,” Shleifer and Vishny (1996, p. 56) note
that:

Given the large impact of executives’ actions on values of firms, why aren’t
very high powered incentive contracts used more often in the United States and
elsewhere in the world? Is their use limited by optimal design of incentives, by
fear of self-dealing, or by distributive politics?
44

The principal-agent model’s emphasis on the trade-off between incentives and insurance
ignores the importance of strategic competition in product markets to the value of the firm.
Our model predicts that product market competition is fundamental to the way shareholders
*

structure managerial incentives. Our empirical work cofirms

this idea.

Thus, we offer

a straightforward explanation for the infrequent use of high-powered incentives–they are
typically not optimal for shareholders.

QED
Proof of Proposition

6

E[T;]= ((A- C)2
+ a’)

Because there is no interior maximum, the first order conditions do not characterize an
equilibrium. In order to find equilibria, we examine the extreme points for contracts.
Suppose that the manager of firm 1 chooses a = M, ~ = M. This generates payoffs of

53

W{=kl+~(A+E–

w:=k2+;

C)2~

(A+ E–c)2;

.

The manager of firm 2’s best respome then is to choose ~ as large as possible, or ~ = M,
and 6 can be arbitrary. In order to characterize an equilibrium, we must find a 15along with
~ = M that make a = M, ~ = M the best response for the manager of firm 1. Setting
6 = –M results in a payoff to the manager of firm 1 of
W~=kI+~(A+&–
It is

C)2~.

immediate that a >0 in order for the manager of firm 1 to earn a positive payoff.

Further, in order for firm 1‘s quantity choice to be nonnegative, it must be the case that
a z ~ because
~; = 7 (P – ~) ~(_3a7~:;:p+7p) = –; (P – ~) *.
But the manager of firm 1’s payoff is increasing in ~, which results in a = ~ = M, which
establishes the equilibrium. In this case, the manager of firm 1 produces q? = O and the
1 A+~–c
manager of tim 2 produces at the monopoly level, qj = ~~.

The manager’s expected

payoffs are:
~[w;] = kl + ; ((A – C)2 + ~2) ~
~[w:] = kz + ~

((A - C)2 + 02) ~.

As the managers share monopoly rents, this outcome cannot be improved on for the
managers. As both a and v must be positive, the other extreme point to check is a =
M, ~ = –M.

Because the problem is symmetric, we have already analyzed this situation

for the manager of firm 2, and so we have found our two pure strategy equilibria. As no
internal solutions exist, these are the only pure strategy equilibria.
