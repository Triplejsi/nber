THE LITIGIOUS PLAINTIFF HYPOTHESIS :
CASE SELECTION AND RESOLUTION

ABSTRACT

A central feature of the litigation process that affects case outcomes is the selection of cases
for litigation. In this study, we present a theoretical framework for understanding the operation of
this suit selection process and its relationship to the underlying distribution of potential claims and
claimants. We implement the model empirically by assuming that individuals vary more in their
litigiousness (inverse costs of litigation) than do corporations.

This assumption, coupled with the

case selection process we present, yields clear predictions on trial rates as a function of whether the
plaintiff and defendant were individuals or corporations. The model also yields a prediction on the
plaintiff’s win rate in lawsuits as a function of the plaintiff’s identity, Our empirical analysis, using
data on over 200,000 federal civil litigations, yields results that are generally consistent with the
theory. Lawsuits where the plaintiff is an individual are found to have higher trial rates and lower
plaintiff win rates.

2 Priest & Klein’s ( 1984) analysis of the selection of cases for litigation analyzed which of the lawsuits
filed eventuate in trials, and they derived some clear predictions
regarding case outcomes.
The central
prediction in the limiting cases is that c=es for trial will be selected such that the plaintiff and defendant
win rates will each be 0,5 in tried cases regardless of the average underlying merits of of the overall set of
suits filed. LValdfogel ( 1995) extends this analysis and shows that there can be systematic deviations from
the Priest-Klein
result, Eisenberg (1990) shows that such deviations exist.
