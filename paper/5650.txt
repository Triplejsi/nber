THE ~ERMATH

OF APPRECIATIONS

ABSTRACT

This paper empirically analyzes a broad range of real exchange rate appreciation episodes.
The cases are identified after compiling a large sample of monthly multilateral real exchange rates
from 1960 to 1994. The objective is twofold. First, the paper studies the dynamics of appreciations,
avoiding the sample selection of analyzing exclusively the crisis (or devaluation) cases. Second, the
paper analyzes the mechanism by which overvaluations are corrected. In particular, we are interested
in the proportion of the reversions that occur through nominal devaluations, rather than cumulative
inflation

differentials.

We calculate the probability of undoing appreciations

depreciations for various degrees of misalignment.

without nominal

The overall conclusion is that it is very unlikely

to undo large and medium appreciations without nominal devaluations.

‘An example of these movements is the Balassa-Samuelson effect. When there is a productivity
growth differential between the traded and nontraded goods sectors and this differential is not
homogeneous across countries, then the (cross country) relative prices of nontraded goods, and
therefore, the RER, will change over time.
100ne could argue that some of the fundamentals chosen may also be related to the departures
from the law of one price. In this case, this second approach will tend to underestimate the extent
of overvaluation. Since the first approach does not control for fundamentals and may overestimate
the extent of overvaluation, one can interpret the resulting two series as defining the boundaries of
the true overvaluation episode.
11Since the RER is trend-stationary this is a perfectly valid procedure.
