1. Introduction
Since the early work of Becker ( 1967), economists studying the returns to education have traditiomlly
focused on the relation between education and wages.

of retirement income needs, or the allocation of resources among alternative

Most individuals make these decisions on the basis of their own judgement,

rather than with

the help of experts, in Iargt part because the market for financial expertise is imperfect (see Bernheim
1994a, 1996 b), It is thertifore conceivable that appropriate forms of education may improve the quality of
personal tinancial decision-making.
Existing evidence cc)ncerning the relation between education and financial choices is quite limited.
Correlations

between an individual’s general level of educational attainment and his or her rate of saving

have been documenttcl by Bernheim ancl Scholz (1993) and Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995).
However, as in the literature on returns to education in labor markets, these correlations may be
attributable to other related factors.

For example, individuals with greater patience presumably tend to

remain in school longer, and to save at higher rates.

As noted by those studying the relation between wage

and schooling (see e.g. Card, 1995), causal inferences about the effects of education are potentially
misleading unless they are derived from sources of variation in education that are plausibly exogenous.
One particularly

pertinent source of variation in education concerns the availability of financial

education in the workplace,

According to one recent survey, as of 1994, 88 percent of large employers

offered some form of financial education, and more than two-thirds had added these programs after 1990. L
Typically, employers provide information and guidance on a range of topics related to retirement planning.
While nearly all such programs cover principles of asset allocation, sizable majorities treat retirement
income needs (73 percent) and retirement strategies (88 percent). g If, as argued by Bernheim ( 1994a,
1995a), low saving frequently results from a failure to appreciate economic vulnerabilities,

then education

of this form could prove to have a powerful effect on rates of saving.
It is doubtful that the availability of employer-based
workers’ underlying predispositions

to save,

retirement education is entirely unrelated to

However, there are a variety of reasons (discussed below) to

believe that employers adopt these programs as remedial measures in instances where employees are
disinclined to save.

[f this is the case, then cross-sectional

estimates of the relation between saving and

education may provide lower bounds on the causal effects of education.

In addition, since many of these

programs have been adopted quite recently, it may be possible to control for an unobsemed predisposition
to save by contrasting the behavior of the same individuals before and after educatioml

interventions.

In this paper, we study the behavioral effects of tinancial education in the workplace using survey
data collected from employers who sponsor pension plans,
the cross-sectional

Our analysis is based in part on estimates of

relations between various forms of education and plan activity.

Since the data contain

repeated observations on many tirms, they also permit us to evaluate the direction of the probable bias in
cross-sectional

estimatts by testing the hypothesis that educational is remedial (through an examination of

the circumstances

under which programs are adopttd or expanded).

Moreover,

the Iongitudiml data allow

us to control explicitly for unobserved (firm-level) fixed effects.
Despite the growing importance of employer-based

retirement education, existing evidence on this

One exception is Bernheim and Garrett (1996), who use a novel household survey to study the effects of
these programs.

to the current paper; we discuss the relations between

In light of the likely bias mentioned in the previous paragraph and

discussed in more detail in section 3, these findings are strongly consistent with the efficacy of retirement
seminars, and they do not rule out the possibility that other forms of education are also effective.
In studying the relation between 401(k) activity and education, we control for a variety of plan
features.

The effects of these features are, of course, of independent interest, and have been the subject of

several prior analyses (s~e Poterba, Venti, and Wise, 1994, Papke, Petersen, and Poterba,
1995, Andrews,

1992, Kusko, Poterba, and Wilcox, 1993, and Scott, 1994). Generally, we find that the

2. Data
The data for our anal]sis come from the 1993 and 1994 versions of the KPA4G Peat Mat-wick
Reriremenf BeneJ/s .$~fmey, [n 1993. KPMG Peat Manvick selected approximately

1100 employers at

random from a list of all the prit’atc and public employers in the United States with at least 200 employees.

If

they were willing to participa[c again, these same employers were retained for the 1994 survey. Any
employers }vho decl incd LOparticipate in 1994 w’erc replaced with a randomly selected employer from the
same indust~, region, and emplo}er-size catego~.
In each year, these employers were questioned by telephone about the administration,

features, and

employee utilization of their retirement plans. Some basic employer data, such as total employees, sales, and
industry, are a~ailablc for all respondents.

In addition, those employers who have a retirement plan (910 in

4

1993 and 861 in 1994) provide some general information about their plan, including the number of
employees co~crcd b> the plan, [he t>pcs of plans offered, and the extent to which financial education and
guidance is provided by [he cmplo~cr to help employees invest for retirement.

Furthermore, for each type of

retirement plan that a [Irm offers, the survey contains detailed questions about its features, eligibility
requirements, and emplo!”ec activity.
Those emplo}ers \\”ho offer401 (k) plans (596 in 1993 and 566 in 1994) report the features of their
plan, including the availability of an employer match, the matching rate provided, whether hardship
withdralvals and loans arc pcrmi[tcd, and lhc number and type of investment options available to a participant
in the plan, The sunc> also allo\\s us to determine \vhich employee groups, such as union, salaried, or parttime employees. arc eligible to pafiicipate in the plan. In addition, participation and contribution rates are
provided for the cmplojccs eligible for the 40 l(k) plan, Thus, for a large sample of over 500 firms each year,
the survey pro~ides a rich set of plan characteristics and utilization rates.

specific rules set forth ill the opplicablc non-discrlrnination

provisions.

These rules \vere Instituted to ensure

an equitable distribution of benefits from pension plans. In the context of 40 l(k)s, they operate by limiting
the amounts that highly compensated employees can contribute as a function of contributions by non-highly
compensated emplo>ccs. An individual is classified as highly compensated if he or she meets any of a
number of specific criteria (c,g. earnings of roughly $100,000 or more, ownership of more than 5 percent of
the company, or earnings of roughly $65,000 or more if this amount is in the top quintile of the firm’s salary
distribution).

In addition to participation rates. [hc suncy also provides contribution rates as a percentage of

employees, and NHC employees.

participation rates arc sli.ghll! Icss than 60 percent for NHC employees, roughly 80 percent for HC
employees, and just over 60 pcrccnt o~crall in both 1993 and 1994. The distribution of participation rates for

3. The Availability

of Retirement

Education

As a first step in our anal>sis. we prolidc descriptive information concerning the availability of different
kinds of retirement cducalion in the \vorkplace. Overall, in 1993 nearly 74 percent of pension plan sponsors
provided summn~ plan descriptions, roughly 65 percent distributed newsletters, and just over 44 percent
offered rctircrnent scrninars LOall cmplo>ccs. When firms are weighted by total employment, summary plan
descriptions and nc~vslcttcrs appear to bc somc~vhat more common (roughly 80 percent in each case), but the
frequency of seminars is essentially unchanged (44 percent). The fraction of firms providing summary plan
description \vas some]tha[ lo\\cr in 1994 than in 1993, but the fractions providing newsletters and seminars
rose slightly.
Since our ullimatc objccti~c is to c~alualc Lherelation between education and behavior, it is important to
develop an understanding of [he sources of variation in educational offerings across firms. Plan sponsors are
presumably more Iikcly to pro\ide information when participants are required to make decisions. It is
therefore natural to spcculatc that [he growlh of educational offerings results in large part from the rising
populari~

of self-dircc[cd plans sLIchas 401 (k)s and 403(b)s (see EBRI, 1995, or the extended discussion in

section 3 of Bcmhcim and Garrett, 1996). Yet the KPMG Peat Mamvick smey

data reveal that seminars,

newsletters, and surnman plan dcscrip[ions arc nearly as common among firms with defined benefit plans
(43,8 percent, 68.9 pcrccnt. and 73,1 percent, respectively for 1993) as among firm with 40 l(k)s (44.4
percent, 71.2 percent. and 80 I pcrccnt. respectively for 1993).
The preceding finding roiscs Lhcpossibility lhat many employers provide retirement education to
address general concerns aboul cmplo>ces’ preparation for retirement, rather than to equip them with planspccific decision-making

skills. One need not construe this as necessarily altruistic.

Education may help

employees to appreciate Ihc values of lhcir pension plans. By promoting adequate preparation for retirement,
an employer may also hope to avoid subsequent conflicts (e.g. over demands for more generous pension
benefits) with older, poorly prepared ~vorkers. Assistance \vith financial plaming may also enhance employee
8

loyalty, improve labor relations, and boost morale.
Of course, comparisons based on ra~v frcqucncics, such as those described above, maybe misleading,
For example, it is common for empto~ers to offer both a defined benefit plan and a supplemental 401(k), It is
therefore possible thnt the frequency of cducaliona! offerings at organizations with defined benefit plans in
part reflects the prcscncc of sccondav

401(k) plans. Also, it is conceivable that educational offerings may

differ systematically by company characteristics that are related to the presence of defined benefit plan.
To investigate this possibility, we estimate probit models explaining the availability of seminars for all
employees, seminars for cmplo>fees over 50 years of age, seminars for employees nearing retirement,
summa~ plan descriptions. and ncljslctlcrs or periodicals.

Results are contained in table 2. Explanatory

variables include variables measuring the l!pcs and varie~ of plans (where the omitted catego~ is “only a

plan co~cragc, and year. The data are pooled across years, and the

standard errors arc corrcctcd to account for potential correlation across obsemations from the same
organization.
Focusing attcn[ion on organizations \vith a single plan, it is evident that seminars of all kinds are most
common among non-profit institutions \\iLh 403(b)s.

Companies with 40 l(k)s are more likely to offer

seminars to all emplo~”ccs thnn companies iiith defined benefit or other kinds of plans, but less likely to offer
seminars specifically for older cmplo>ccs. Written materials of all kinds are most commonly used among
companies with 401 (k)s. but there are no significant differences between the likelihoods that sponsors of
other kinds of plans pro~idc such materials.

Thus. \vhilc the rising popularity of self-directed plans may have

promoted the groi~lh of ccrtoin Educational offerings, the impetus for this growth appears to be much more
general. This is consistent w“iththe findings of Bcmhcim and Garrett (1996).
Table 2 also indicates that educational offerings are significantly more common among organization
with multiple plans. Emplo\’ment and coverage are positively correlated with seminar offerings, but not with
the availability of ]*TiLtcnmaterials. This may reflect the presence of economies of scale in the provision of

9

seminars.

Generally, the f’rcqucncies ofcducational

offerings did not change appreciably between 1993 and

1994.
When analyzing the relation bctwccn education and behavior, we must necessarily restrict attention to
organizations wilh plans Lha(permit cmplo>ces to make choices. We therefore focus our attention on
401(k)s.

Since Lhcdeterminants of education offerings relate to the selection process determining the

incidence of “treatment,” it is important to reexamine the determinants of these offerings specifically in the
context of 40 l(k)s.

If, for example, education tends to be offered in response to a demand for information by

employees who are naturally inclined to save at high rates, then positive cross-sectional correlations between
education and 401 (k) ac[i~’it} could rctlcct selection, rather than the influence of employer-based
employee behavior.

If, on [hc other hand. companies tend to provide education as a remedial measure to

employees \Fho arc o[hcm\isc disinclined to save, then the nature of selection could obscure an underlying

Analogously to lablc 2. table 3 provides estimates of probit models explaining the availability of various

Thus far, we ha}e not exploited the longitudinal features of our data. Doing so permits us to examine
the circumstances under \\hich employers establish or expand educational offerings.

Specifically, we regress

the change in seminar offerings bet~tecn 1993 and 1994 on a variety of “initial” (1993) company and pension
plan characteristics.

For the purpose of [his analysis, we measure the change in seminar offerings as the

difference bct\\ccn the ‘-intcnsit}” of seminars (measured on a scale of O to 3) in 1993 and 1994 (see footnote
4),
Results appear in table 4. Separate results are presented for each of our five educational categories.
The most striking feature of this [able is the pattern of negative coefficients for the initial participation rate of
NHC employees in [hc spcci Iicotions explaining changes in seminar offerings.

In the case of seminars for all

employees, the cocflicicnt is highl! significant: it is marginally significant (i.e. with slightly less than 95°/0
cent’idencc) for lhc other t\\o seminar variables.

This implies that low participation among NHC employees

is strongly associated \\]th subsequent increases in employer-sponsored

seminars. This result does not,

however, carry over to \vrillcn materials. No other variable consistently passes tests for statistical
significance at con~’entional ICVCIS.The coefficients of the initial HC participation rate are also negative for
the seminar variables. but their magnitudes and levels of si~ificance

are smaller. With low confidence, the

estimates indicate that cducotiona] improvements were more likely among fu-ms with pensions plans that

In our reported estimates,

we again correct our standard errors to rcllect clustered sampling.
Since nondiscrimination

rules arc binding for many employers (Garrett, 1996), education programs may

be designed to encourngc participation b! NHC employees.

Moreover, since HC and NHC households start

out with different levels of financial sophistication, we would expect financial education to affect their
behavior diffcrcnlly.

For both reasons, Ire estimate separate regressions for these groups as well as for the

combined sample.
Results arc con(aincd in lhc first panel of table 5. The dependent variables for these regressions – the
plan participation rates – va~ [rem I to 100 pcrccnt. The estimated effects of the key explanatory variables
are described beloiv.
i, The role oJseminor.s
For our base-case cstlmatcs. \ve usc dummy variables to measure the intensity (frequency) of
educational offerings.

In this ~vn~.wc a~oid imposing assumptions on the fmctional relation between

participation and an arbitrarily scaled rncasurc of education (as discussed in section 2, we do, however, use
the same dummy variable 10 represent the responses “sometimes” and “rarely”).

In subsection D, we also

present results based on a single scalar measure of educational intensity. We also focus exclusively on
seminars for all employees, rather than on seminars targeted at employees over 50 or employees near
retirement.

In practice. Lheseminar variables are highly colinear, and it is difficult to identi~ their separate

effects ~vith precision.
Reading ncross [he firsl [\vo ro\\s of ihc first panel of Table 5, it is apparent that frequent seminars have
a consistently positive and significant cffccl on participation in self-directed plans. For non-highly

13

compensated employees, frequent seminars arc associated \vith participation

rates that me 11.5 percentage

points higher than plans ~vith no seminars. The corresponding figure for highly compensated employees is
6.4 percentage points. TIICSCare economically large estimates given mean participation rates – 60 to 80
percent – in the sample. The occasional seminar indicator variable is, however, insignificant in each
specification.
The results in tnblc 5 may obscure lhe relation between education and participation among HC
employees.

Although censoring at Lhcplan Ic\el (at either O percent or 100 percent) is relatively rare for “all”

employees and for NHC clmployees. it is much more common for HC employees,

Specifically, for 32 percent

of the sample, the HC participation ralc is 100 percent. Obviously, increases in seminars and changes in
other

plan characteristics cannot be associated with higher participation rates for companies that achieve 100

percent HC participation. Wc investigate Lheeffects of censoring in section D, below, where \ve estimate
Tobit specifications.
These results arc consistent \\-ith the h>pothcsis that seminars stimulate 40 l(k) participation generally,
and especially among NHC cmplo!ecs
non-discrimination

This implies that retirement seminars may be an effective response to

rules. Ho\\cvcr, there is no indication in the pooled results that seminars matter unless

they are conducted frcqucntl}.
ii: Other Jtirtns ofedlicall<)n ond in[ormotion dissemination
We include sclcral additional cdl]cation \ariables (newsletters and summary plan descriptions) to
examine \vhcthcr all educational and inromlational efforts are equally effective. Summa~ plan descriptions
typically amount to disclosure of plan characteristics, and contain very little (if any) recognizable education,
While it is perhaps conceivable that employees \vould be unwilling to trust (and therefore to participate in)

(k) participants say that they read these materials, and 33

percent say that thcj con~ributc more [o Lhcirplans as a result. One might therefore expect newsletters to
have an effect on behavior similar to thal of seminars, Altcmativcly, individuals may exaggerate their
responses to nc\vslcttcrs in response to survey questions, particularly
“appropriate

if they perceive this to be the

response, ”

Notably, in the regressions of table 5. aside from seminors, no other medium of providing information
and education to emplo!ccs – either through nclvslcttcrs or summary plan descriptions – has any significant
association with participation rates. This is consistent }vith the hypothesis that these media have no effect on
participation.

In principle. selection bias could mask a behavioral response. However, in contrast to

seminars, there is little indication in lhc results o[scction 3 that the provision of written materials is
motivated by low participation.
iii, I)Ion chclrocterlstics
There is mixed c~idcnce in LhcIitcraturc on the effect of matching rates on participation in self-directed
plans, despite the fact that matching is ]cn common. According to a 1990 Hewitt and Associates survey, 79
percent of 944 major US. corporations matched employee contributions.

Papke (1995) finds a strong,

However, the 401 (k) sponsored by Lhefirm examined by Kusko, Poterba, and Wilcox was part of a profitsharing plan, and hcncc had unusuatly \olatile mntch rates

It is not clear that one can generalize from

participation responses in profit-sharing plans to more common plan types, where match rates change much
less frequently.

In principal, we expect matching rates to exert a positive effect on participation since they

provide a pure substitution effect at the extensive margin,
In all the cross-sectional recessions

wc have examined, there is a positive and significant correlation

between the exis[cncc ofa match find participation. 9 The regression results in table 5 imply that plans with
matches have participolion rates [hat arc 14.6 to 16.9 percentage points higher than plans without matches,
Loan provisions alloi( families to borrow against contributions made to the self-directed plan.
Conventional reasoning suggests that eligible w’orkers will be more likely to participate in plans with loan
provisions since they \\”ill ha}e access to funds in the event they need to borrow. An alternative view holds
that loan provisions \\”ill be ncgati~c]y correlated \vith participation because they exacerbate “self-control”
problems \\illl saving (SCCc.g, ShclTrin and Thalcr, 1988). We find that the correlation between the existence
of loan provisions and participation arc positive but insiqificant

in the regressions for all employees, and

negative but insignificant in the separale regressions for HC or NHC employees.
Having a broad range of investment options presumably increases the attractiveness of participation,
The number of options in these plans is not particularly large, with a mean of 2.8 in 1993 and a mean of 3.7
in 1994, A single investment option can bc narrow (say stock in the employee’s company, or a guaranteed
life insurance contracts), or broad. like the Fidelih family of mutual finds,

Although we expect investment

options to be positively correlated \vith participation, this effect is not significant in any specification.

iv. Firm chorocterlstics
An obvious concern ~vith cross-scclionol estimates of the kind considered here is that the variables of
interest may bc corrclntcd \vilh unobserved lirm-spccitic characteristic.

In that case, the correlations that we

attribute to seminars may in ffict reflect other factors. In addition to the plan characteristics already
mentioned, we thcrcforc include a set of firm-specific variables to try to account for other pertinent factors.
The existcncc ofothcr pension plans should matter for two distinct reasons. First, other pension plans
may be positi~el? correlated Ivi[h participation in a self-directed plan. There is extensive evidence that the
existence of a 40 l(k) is posi Li\cl! correlated \\ith employees’ tastes for saving (Engen, Gale, and Scholz,
1995; and Bcrnhcim 1996a). It is likely that the same is true for other pensions. Thus, the presence of
pensions may be positi]cly correlated \\itll participation in self-directed plans. Second, other pension plans
may reduce the likelihood of participation in a self-directed plan because the pension may provide households
with sufficient rctircmcnt sa~ing.
As \vould bc cxpcctcd i[ pcnslons and self-dircctcd plans are initiated in response to employees’ wishes,
participation rates arc higher in self-dircctcd plans \vhen the sponsoring firms offers at least one other
pension plan, The effect for all employees is significant at conventional levels.
There may bc systematic differences in self-directed plan offerings depending on the size of the firm,
and on the number of cmplo!’ccs co~.ered b!’ the plan. These differences might, for example, arise from
economies of scale in plan administration. or from correlations between size and other variables, such as plan
age, unobserved dimensions of plan gcnerosih,

or the nature of peer goup effects, We include the number

of employees in the firm to capture variations in participation that may be associated with firm size, and the
fraction of employees covered to capture variations in participation that maybe related to plan size. We find
that firm size is nega[ivcll associated \\-ilh participation, but that participation rises significantly with the
fraction of emplo>ees co~crcd.

17

The unionization indicator variable is consistently insignificant across specifications.
v. Sllmrnoty
In pooled cross-scclional
participation,

rc.gressions. there are a number of factors that are significantly associated with

inc]uding match rates and certain characteristics of the company. The effect of frequent

seminars is economical]> Iargc, positi~c, slatisticall}’ significfint. No other educational variable significantly
affects participation.

[n light of the sclcclion issue documented in section 3, there is reason to believe that

these estimates understate the behavioral impact of retirement seminars, but may accurately reflect the impact
of\\Tittcn matcrinls.

B. Factors

related

to contributions

in self-directed

plans

As indicated in table 1. the sunc~ COIICCIS
information on average contribution rates for plan
participants,

Multiplying the aicrage contribution rate times the participation rate gives the average

contribution rate across all eligibles. We use this as our dependent variable to examine contributions.
Because the data arc aggregated across plans, (here is no obvious way to use information on the fraction of
nonparticipants

and lIIc conditional mean among participants separately without making strong ad hoc

assumptions on the data. Since the conditional mean among participants is of limited intrinsic interest, we
therefore use the transfom~cd contribution variable.
Obviously, our contributions variable may inherit some of the properties of our participation variable.
Even so, there is no compelling reason (o expect. p priori, that contributions will vaty with education in the
same way as participation.

To scc Ivh>. consider the follo~ving example.

Suppose a firm’s employees differ

in lheir taste for sa~in.g Those \\ith a high taste ~vill participate in self-directed plans when available and,
due to the tax subsidy (and possibly employer match), devote a relatively high fraction of sala~ to these
plans. Employees \\ith low tastes for saving \vill choose not to contribute.
induce employees \vith lo\v tastes for sa~ing to contribute,

Now suppose frequent seminars

If they contribute at low levels, the mean

contribution, conditional on participation, may actually fall, unless education also encourages high savers to
18

save even more. It is conceivable. ho~lc~cr, that education might actually reduce saving among those \vho
would othenvise

put atva~- “’too much” relati~c to standard

mean of the contribution

rules of thumb.

Thus, even the unconditional

ra[c might fall \\ith education

As is clear from the second pnncl of Table 5, the frequent seminar variable is positively and significantly

associated \vith contributions for lhc regressions involving all employees and non-highly compensated
employees.

The cffccl is quite Iargc. Mean (unconditional) contribution rates are around 3.4 percent of

salary, so the estimates imply that contributions are nearly 20 percent larger in firms offering frequent
seminars. This result is consistent \\ilh the hypothesis that retirement education – and frequent seminars in
particular – positivcl! affect (I1csize of contributions to self-directed plans.
In the specification for fill cmplo!ccs. bo[h match rates and loan provisions are positively and
significantly associntcd ~iith contribution rates. Larger firms have lo~ver contribution rates (the effect is
significant for highl!-compensated

cmplo}ecs).

The larger the fraction of employees covered by a self-

directcd plan, the higher arc contribution ra[es (the effect is si~iticant

for non-highly compensated

employees and the all cmp]oyccs specification).

C.

Longitudinal

evidence

on participation

and contributions

The specifications displa>cd in table 5 use pooled data from 1993 and 1994. To control for spurious
factors that might generate an apparent cross-sectional relationship bet~veen seminars and participation or
contributions, \ve included a number of plan- and firm-specific variables. Nevertheless, a skeptical reader
might question these rcsul[s on the grounds lhat seminars are correlated \vith other firm-specific
characteristics, such as lhc dcyce of interest management takes in their employees, and that these other
characteristics arc responsible for lhc obscned

correlation \vith behavior (perhaps through plan generosity,

\vhich is only impcrfcctl} accounted for in our specification).
As discussed earlier. \vc ha~e observations in both years for nearly 300 firms, Thus, it is possible to
repeat our analysis, diffcrcncing Lhcdata for our short (2-year) panel. While differencing removes time19

invariant plan-specific characteristics, it also exacerbates any measurement error problems that might be
present, making it more difficult to estimate correlations that arise from behavioral relationships.
The first panel oflablc 6 examines participation, repeating the same specification as sho~~n in table 5,
but using the firsl-diffcrcnccd

data. Allhough the statistical si~ificance

of the results is not quite as striking,

this is probably to be cxpcclcd because lhc sample size is considerably smaller and because of the problems
arising from diffcrcncing short panels. Nevertheless, we find that instituting seminars on a frequent basis is
associated with a 7,7 pcrccnlagc point increase in participation rates, and the effect is significant at the 11
percent level for the all-employee sample. For non-highly compensated employees, the effect is 12.1
percentage points. and it is significant nt the 7 pcrccnt level. It is worth noting that the estimated effects of
occasional seminars appear s~rongcr in the diffcrcnccd estimates.

Indeed, the effects of frequent and

occasional seminars no~~appear 10 be roughly proportional.
We ~icw this as fllrthcr support for the h}vothcsis that retirement education – and frequent seminars in
particular - influence lhc saving bchalior of employees.

Naturally, we cannot resolve the question of

causality \vith onl~ t~~-o!cars of daln: it is. for example, conceivable that employees might agitate for
seminars once Lhc} start participating (though it is doubtful that their employer would respond over such a
short lime frame).
Our resulls on match rates follo\v [he pattern observed in the literature.

Although we find that match

rates appear to ha~c a strong, posilive correlation ~vith participation and contributions in cross-sectional data,
the effect disappears \vhcn one follo\vs the same firms over time. Because actual changes in match rates are
infrequent, it is possible that “obscmcd” changes arc dominated by measurement errors, in which case the
panel estimates of Lhcmatching effect maybe highly misleading.

This may occur, at

In these same cases, the point

estimates for Lhecffccls of occasional seminars arc roughly half of the corresponding point estimates for the
effects of frcqucnl seminars (SCClnblc 6). 11is therefore natural to consider an alternate specification based
on a scalar measure of educational intensity that allows us to summarize the effects of education through a
single parameter.

Tnstcrid ofconslnlcting

we simply measure frequency on a scale of zero to three, depending on whether education is offered never,

We estimate median and robust regression models to reduce the potential influence of outlying

(as well as for the Tobit

estimates) using the pooled data arc not adjusted for the fact that the same firm may appear in the pooled

sho~vn in Table 5, we do not vieiv this as a major shortcoming.
We use Tobit regressions to account for right and left censoring of participation rates at O and 100

i, An alternative tneosure oj-senlinar \ntens]ly
For even specification contained in tables 5, 6, 7, and 8, we present results based on an analogous
specification in ~vhich lie usc a single scalar measure of educational intensity, as described at the outset of
this section. The rcsulling cocfllcicnts for seminars arc presented in tables 7 and 8 under columns labeled
“intensity.”
Generally spenklng. for spccilications involving pooled (as opposed to difference)

data, the magnitudes

and statistical precision of educational effects are similar to the results obtained using separate dummies for
frequent and occasional seminars.

Ho\\cver, the usc of the seminar intensity variable sharpens the estimates

considerably for (he diffcrcnced data. For example, in the first column of table 6 (which concerns
participation rates). the cocflicicnt on frequent seminars for NHC employees is only significant at the 7
percent level. Ho\vc\cr. its magnitude is also roughly twice that of the occasional seminar variable, which
suggests that LISCof (I1cinicnsit> vnriablc ma! be appropriate.

estimates of participation rates

[n general. \\-ith diffcrcnccd data, the effects of seminars on participation (table 7) and

contributions (table 8) arc found to be significant at a higher level of confidence when a single measure of
educational intensity- is used.
ii. Median and roh IIst regression.

robustne.~s of participation

results

We present median and robust regression results for participation in the middle sections of Table 7. In
many respects, these results are qualitative}’ similar to the OLS estimates.

In the pooled data, the coefficient

on frequent seminars for NHC emplojccs drops from 11.5 in the OLS specification to 9.9 in the median and
11.2 in the robust regression.

Ho\\c\er.

both of [hese coefficients remain significant at the 1 percent level.

The coefficients of occasional seminars for NHC employees rise relative to OLS, but still fail to achieve
statistical significance at confcntional

levels. There is no indication that seminars – even frequent ones –

23

have a signiiicfint impact on Lhcporticipalion rates of HC employees.
of frequent seminars on HC cmplo!’ccs measured in OLS recessions

It is therefore possible that the effects
(as well as in the Tobit recessions

reported later) reflect lhe inllucncc of oulliers. For HC employees, the unexpected negative coefficient (from

OLS) on occasional seminars is reduced to a number much closer to zero in both the median and robust
recessions.

Finally, the effect of frcqucnl seminars on participation rates for all employees is a bit weaker in

median regession

and robust regressions than for OLS; hoivcver, the effect of occasional seminars, though

still smaller than the cf(cct or ~rcqucnt seminars. no~v achieves conventional levels of statistical si~ificance.
For the diffcrcnccd data. both the median and robust recessions

reduce the size of the coefficients for

frequent seminars. but also incrcasc the precision \vith l~hich they are measured.

The coefficient on frequent

seminars for NHC cmplo!ecs drops from 121 in the OLS specification to 7.4 in the median and 8.6 in the
robust regression.

Ho\\c\cr.

\\hilc the OLS coefficient ~vas only significant at the 7 percent level, the median

with differcnced data. it is significant (and substantial) in both median and robust regression estimates.
Median and robust re~cssions

For the median

reg~ession in particular, (IICcffccl is statistically significant, even though its magnitude is small. We suspect
that this result is attributnblc to the nature of the distribution of the difference

HC participation rates. Many

of the participation ra(cs for HC crnplo~ccs arc at or near 100 percent for both 1993 and 1994; consequently,
more than 30 percent of the firms in the sample cxpcricnce no change in the measured participation rate of
HC employees between 1993 and 1994. Since the median change is zero, and since there are so many zeros,
it is not surprising that our explanato~

variables are found to have very little effect on the median, or that this

finding is precise. The cffcci of frequent seminars on participation rates disappears in the median and robust
regression estimates of the diffcrcnccd specification for all employees; however, the impact of occasional
seminars emerges as signi ticant. Final I!, as noted earlier the use of the intensity variable also enhances the

iii. Median and robust regression: robustness of the contribution

results

The median and robust regression results for contribution rates appear in Table 8. The top panel
contains results for regressions fvith pooled data. The results for the robust regressions are qualitatively
similar to the earlier OLS estimation. ~vith a slight drop in the coefficients on frequent seminars. For
example, in the specification for NHC cmplo~ccs, this coefficient drops from 0.81 to 0.69. The statistical
significance of the cstimotcs is colmparablc to Lhat of the OLS coefficients, with the coefficient on frequent

seminars for NHC cmployccs remaining significant at the 1 percent significance level. The effect of
occasional seminars is also sla[islicall} significant in the specification for all employees.

In contrast, the

The bottom panel of table 8 presents median and robust regression results for contribution rates using
difference

data. The effect of frequent seminars on NHC contribution rates is still reasonably strong, and

similar to that obtained using OLS. None of the olhcr seminar dummies depicted in this Io\ver panel achieves
statistical signi ficancc, The estimated effect of frequent seminars on the HC contribution rate is actually
ncgati~e and fairly Iargc in magnitude. but not vc~ precise. Ho\vever, as \vith the previous specifications,
\vhcn the seminar intcnsit> variable is used. median and robust regression estimates of the seminar effect for
NHC employees are similar in magnitude to the OLS results and statistically significant at the usual levels of
confidence.
iv. Tobii regression re,slllls
Tobit results for rates or participation appear in the last section of Table 7. The coefficients for both

25

frequent and occasional seminars increase in size (relative to OLS) for all three employee groups. The most
tiamatic change occurs in the coefficient for frequent seminars for HC employees, which increases from 6.4
to 10,5. This result is nol surprising gi~cn lhc fact that more than 30 percent of the HC observations are
right-censored,

Although precision is somclfhat lower for the Tobit estimates than for OLS, the coefficient

of frequent seminars for NHC employees remains significant at the 1 percent level, and the coefficient for HC
employees remains significant at the 5 pcrccnt Icvcl. These results suggest that censoring causes a downward
bias in the OLS cocfficicnts, and that HC and NHC employees respond to education more similarly than the
OLS results appear to indicate. Again, using the seminar intensity variable results in more precisely
estimated effects.
