5 James and Skinner (1985) divide industries in 1850 into two categories: “skilled” (e.g., woodworking)
and “unskilled” (e.g., clothing). They find that in both “skilled” and “unskilled” industries raw materials
were the relative complements of physical capital, although the effect was greater in the “skilled” sector.
More importantly for the capital-skill complementarily
hypothesis is that skilled labor was the better
substitute for capital in its sector than was unskilled labor in its. Thus an increase in capital (or raw
materials) would have decreased the relative demand for skilled labor. Cain and Paterson (1986) do not
consider skill differences but find, similar to James and Skinner, that capital and raw materials were
relative complements and that both together substituted for labor.
In the framework we provide below, capital and skilled labor are complements in the creation of
workable machinery which is then used together with unskilled labor to produce output. We use, here,
the language of the existing literature rather than that of our framework.
b According to Sokoloff (1986) the initial deskilling involved little capital and mechanization
of the Smithian pin-factory variety. Landes (1972) takes an opposing view.

a Batch methods were common to various production processes such as those in chemicals, certain
nonferrous products, some foods (e.g., butter, sugar), liquors, beer, and a host of other products that are
liquid. Late in the nineteenth century and continuing to ours, continuous-process
methods were pioneered
in products requiring little assembly and having few or no moving parts, such as oats, flour, canned foods
(eg., condensed milk, soup), soap, film, paper, matches, and cigarettes (Chandler 1977).
9 See, for example, Atack (1987) and Sokoloff (1984) concerning the transition from the artisanal shop
to the factory in the nineteenth century. Both make the important point that the transition was slow in
some industries. It depended not just on technological change (often simply changes in the organization
of work) but also on decreases in transport costs. In some industries (e.g., boots and shoes, clothing,
furniture, leather, meatpacking, tobacco) a significant minority of value added was produced in artisanal
shops (< 7 employees with no power source) even as late as 1870. And in some (e.g., saddle~),
the
majority of value added came from artisanal shops in 1870. Even though there were economies from
larger scale for much of manufacturing, transport costs were still too high to justify a complete shift in
the mode of production across the entire United States.

la See Table 1 for the various conditions. We are considering here a small factor-neutral technological
change around F,. Greater technological change, as in the movement to A, can decrease K/Q.
19More formally, the condition is that: (r’~/{~) < [(uE/u~)] . [(1 - u~)/(1 - a~)] - (L1~/ll~) Intuitively,
the condition for the shift from H to F to decrease the relative demand for skilled labor, given Q, will not
occur if (r”~/r*~)is too high. The cost of installed capital will be relatively high in the H sector when the
cost of skilled labor is great in comparison with raw capital. When that occurs, the H sector will have an
incentive to conserve on expensive K* in the production of Q, thus substituting unskilled labor for K*.
But the condition will hold, even when ({”/{~) is high, if u~ is sufficiently low in comparison with u~.
The shift to the F technology will, then, still increase the relative demand for unskilled labor because the
marginal product of ~ is lower in the H technology (given Q and L.)
The effect is further helped by
the assumption that X1~> 11~. It does seem reasonable that, for given Q and ~, the marginal product of unskilled
labor was lower in the artisanal shop mode of production compared with the factory. After all, the reason for having
the factory system, with its more intricate division of labor, was to increase the marginal product of unskilled labor.
20 The shift from A to C could arise from exogenous

advance (growth in y= relative to

Y*, ~) or such change could have been fostered by an increase in the relative price of unskilled labor
(increase in wu/r*), as may have occurred with the expansion of high schools after c.191O and with the
ending of open immigration in the 1920s.

force that is skilled, The cause of the technological shift in their case is the lower relative price of raw
materials in the United States versus Britain.

24Several data sets culled from the U.S. censuses of manufactures are used. We assembled data for
1909 and 1919 and matched them by (pseudo) 4-digit SIC industry using the 1909 industries. Similar data,
covering 1909, 1914, 1919, and 1929, were generously provided by Arthur Woolf (see Woolf 1980). They
contain information on power sources, omit some detail on wage-earners, and are not matched over time
by industry, We matched the 1929 industries in the Woolf data to our 1909 and 1919 industries and added
the missing information on wage-earners.
Across the three years (1909, 1919, and 1929) we can match 228
(pseudo) 4-digit industries covering gg~. of employment in those years. The 1909 and 1919 census data
surveyed all firms with more than $500 in gross output; that for 1929 used a $5000 cutoff point. There
appear to be no important biases as a result (see Fabricant 1940).

Most, rather than all, of those who
claimed to complete 12 years of school graduated from high school because, even as late as 1940, some
had been educated in ungraded schools, some may have been left back in school, and some, in this period
of soaring education levels, may have overstated their school attainment, as we believe was the case for
older cohorts (see Goldin and Katz 1995a).

35 In iron and steel “the proportion of common laborers was cut approximately in half from 1910 to
1931. The evidence is unmistakable,” notes Jerome, “that recent progress has eliminated unskilled labor
to a much greater extent than other grades” (1934, p. 63). In all these industries, the use of conveyors,
traveling
cranes, jitneys, carriers, industrial trucks, and other handling devices reduced the relative
demand for unskilled labor. The changes, moreover, were evident as early as 1916 to 1920.
36The role of electricity in increasing the relative demand for skilled workers is complex. Nye (1990)
concludes that electricity increased the relative demand for skill but recognizes the large number of effects.
“As the electrified factory evolved it required a different mix of labor and management
more middle
management; more engineers and technicians; fewer artisanal workers; and a more complex grading of
worker skills, with many more semiskilled laborers
and far fewer unskilled workers . Boy mule drivers
in coal mines, carriers in tire factories, or shovelers of raw materials in steel mills saw their work taken
over by electric locomotives, conveyors, and cranes
as a few skilled men using expensive machines did

by a mass of the unskilled (pp. 234-35).

We also analyze, in Table 5, the relationship

37We construct a similar regression using micro-level data from the 1940 PUMS by aggregating across
industries,
The analogous regression of the log(average wage, production workers) by industry on
average years of schooling of male blue-collar workers, 18-34 years old, in that industry (and the
percentage
female of blue-collar workers) yields a coefficient of .185 (se. .013). In contrast, a micro-level
regression of individual Iog(eamings) on own schooling (plus a female dummy) yields a coefficient of ,040
(se. .0004). It should be noted that because an experience variable is not included, the coefficient on
education is lower than in regressions to measure the return to education.
3g The wage regressions in Table 4 (and those in Table 5) use consistent data on average annual
earnings of blue-collar workers by industry for 1909, 1919, and 1929. Because hours of work may have
varied in a manner that could bias the results, we have also estimated these regressions (for 1909 and
1919) using hourly earnings, where hours worked in each industry is estimated from a distribution of
hours. The results are robust to the choice of hourly or annual data.

45Another reason not to include the wage ratio when estimating eq. (5) is that the estimates will then
suffer from a version of division bias, because WP appears in the denominators of both the dependent
variable and the wage ratio measure. Following Berman, Bound, and Griliches (1994), we also add an
output term to account for cyclical differences in the extent to which non-production and production labor
are quasi-fixed factors. The inclusion of din(Q) also allows the production function to be non-homothetic.
46 The weighting of the regression is another data issue. Because classification errors are more of a
similar results obtain
problem for small industries we weight by the wage bill share. Qualitatively
without weights, and median regressions (LAD estimates) without weights also yield similar results.
47 Two methods of accounting for proprietor earnings can be offered: one imputes their earnings as
if they earned the average non-production wage in the census, and the second assumes that proprietor
income entirely reflects returns to capital and should not be included in the overall wage bill (it was not
supposed to be included). We present the results under the latter assumption; they are robust to either.

technologies we believe increased the relative demand for educated labor on the shop-floor. The demand
for more educated workers on the farm must also have increased as farm machinery became more
complex. Perhaps that is why high schools expanded even more rapidly in the rural farm areas of the
Great Plains and Far West than elsewhere.

Notes: The unit of observation is a 1940-industry group.
Industries from the 1909, 1919, and 1929
Censuses of Manufactures are aggregated up to the 1940 groupings, e.g., beverages in 1940 contains the
1909 categories of distilled, malt, and vinous liquors, and mineral and soda waters. Each observation is
weighted by the industry share of total blue-collar employment in manufacturing averaged over 1909,
1919, and 1929. The dependent variable is the percentage of 18 to 34-year old, male blue-collar workers
in the industry in 1940 who graduated high school. The mean for 1940 among all blue-collar workers in
this group is 0,274. Standard errors are in parentheses.

Notes: The average wage is computed as the (production-worker
wage bill) /(average annual number of
wage earners) for all years. Independent variables are defined in Table 3. Log(K/L) by indust~ for 1919
is used in the 1929 regression; YO child for 1919 is used in the 1929 regression. Regressions are weighted
by the number of wage earners in each year, as are the means for 1929.
