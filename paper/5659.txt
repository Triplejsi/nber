GROWTH CYCLES

ABSTRACT

We construct a rational expectations model in which aggregate growth alternates between
a low growth and a high growth state. When all agents expect growth to be slow, the returns on
investment are low, and little investment takes place. This slows growth and confirms the prediction
that the returns on investment will be low. But if agents expect fast growth, investment is high,
returns

are high, and growth

complementarit

is rapid,

This expectational

indeterminacy

is induced

by

y between different types of capital goods. In a growth cycle there are stochastic

shifts between high and low growth states and agents take full account of these transitions. The rules
that agents need to form rational expectations in this equilibrium are simple. The equilibrium with
growth cycles is stable under the dynamics implied by a correspondingly

The function T is the compmition

by the relative slope

and rfi denote

interest rate that is also below the interest rate in the high-

growth equilibrium.

As the figure shows,

when the mapping

T is applied

to r;, it lads to a value T(r~ ) that is above r~, so adjustment moves the
expected inter=t rate in the right direction. In contrast, when applied T is
applied to rfi, it l=ds to a value that is below rfi, so the learning dynamics
drives the economy away from the high growth equilibrium.g
If one accepts,

as we do, the notion that any perfect foresight equilibrium

that is unstable under simple learning rules is unlikely to be realized

returns, investment

goods are cheaper when a larger fraction of total output

is devoted to investment. We generate multiple growth rates despite the fact
that investment goods are more expensive when investment is higher and
growth is more rapid. We reiterate that the only nonconvexity in the model
is the fixed cost associated with invention. All of the work that is done by
increasing returns in other models is done here by complementarily.
We have also chosen our parameters so that the rate of growth of Z and
(and hence also A) are positive in both of our perfect for=ight equilibria.
