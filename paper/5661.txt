LAW AND FINANCE

ABSTRACT

This paper examines legal rules covering protection of corporate shareholders and creditors,
the origin of these rules, and the quality of their enforcement in 49 countries.

The results show that

common law countries generally have the best, and French civil law countries the worst, legal
protections of investors, with German and Scandinavian civil law countries located in the middle.
We also find that concentration of ownership of shares in the largest public companies is negatively
related to investor protections, consistent with the hypothesis that small, diversified shareholders are
unlikely to be important in countries that fail to protect their rights.

1. Overview of the issues.
In traditional finance of Modigliani and Miller (1958), securities are recognized by their
cash flows. For example, debt has a fixed promised stream of interest payments, whereas equity
entitles its owner to receiving dividends.

Recent financial research has shown that this is fm from

the whole story, and that the defining feature of various securities is the rights that they bring to
.,
their owners (see, e.g., Hart 1995). Thus shares typically give their owners the right to vote for
directors of companies, whereas debt entitles creditors to, for example, the power to repossess
collateral when the company fails to make promised payments,
The rights attached to securities become tremendously important once it is recognized that
managers of companies act in their own interest.

Investors’ rights give them the power to extract

from these managers the returns on their investment.

Thus shareholders receive dividends

because they can vote out the directors who do not pay them, and creditors are paid because they
have the power to repossess collateral.

Without these rights, investors would not be able to get

paid, and therefore firms would not have the benefit of raising finds from these investors,

The

rights attached to securities are what managers and entrepreneurs give up to get finance,
But the view that securities are inherently characterized by some intrinsic rights is
incomplete as well, It ignores the obvious point that these rights depend on the legal rules of the
jurisdictions where these securities are issued.

Does being a shareholder in France give an

investor the same privileges as being a shareholder in the United States, India, or Mexico? Would
a secured creditor in Germany fare as well when the borrower defaults as one in Taiwan or Italy,
assuming that the value of the collateral is the same in all cases? Law and the quality of its
enforcement are potentially important determinants of what rights security holders have and how

3

well these rights are protected.

Since the protection investors receive determines their readiness

to finance firms, corporate finance may critically turn on these legal rules and their enforcement.
Indeed, the differences in legal protections of investors might help explain why firms are
financed and owned so differently in different countries,

Why do Italian companies rarely go

public (Pagano, Panetta and Zingales 1995)? Why does Germany have such a small stock market,
but also maintains very luge and powefil

rights -- small in Sweden and the United States, and much larger in Italy and Israel (Levy 1982,

stocks backed by comparable assets -- and why did Russian companies have virtually no access to
external finance (Boycko, Shleifer and Vishny 1993)? Why is ownership of large American and
British companies so widely dispersed (Berle and Means 1932)? The content of legal rules in
different countries may well shed light on these corporate governance puzzles,
In recent years, economists and legal scholars have begun to examine theoretically the
costs of benefits of alternative legal rules regarding investor rights (e.g., Bebchuk 1995, Bebchuk
and Zingales 1995, &omb

1993, Grossman and Hart 1988, Harris and Raviv 1988). The trouble

is, there are no systematic data available on what the legal rules pertaining to corporate
governance are around the world, how well these rules are enforced in different countries, and
what effect these rules have. There is no systematic knowledge, for example, of whether different
countries actually do have substantially different rules that might explain differences in their
financing patterns. Comparative statistical analysis of the legal underpimings

of corporate finance

4
-- and commerce more generally -- remains unchartered territory.
In this paper, we attempt to explore this territory.

We examine empirically how laws

protecting investors differ across countries, how quality of enforcement of these laws varies, and
whether these variations matter for corporate ownership patterns around the world.
Our starting point is the recognition that laws in different countries are typically not
written from scratch, but rather transplanted -- voluntarily or otherwise -- from a few legal
families or traditions (Watson 1974).

In general, commercial laws come from two broad

traditions: common law and civil law, Legal rules of civil law countries are derived from Roman
Law, and “are conceived as rules of conduct intimately linked to ideas of justice and morality”
(David and Brierley 1985, p. 22). These rules are usually developed by legal scholars, and
incorporated into commercial codes. In contrast, common law is British in origin, and was
“formed primarily by judges who tried to resolve specific disputes” (David and Brierley, p. 24).
Furthermore, there are only three major civil law traditions or families that modem commercial
laws originate from: French, German, and Scandinavian,

The French and the German civil

traditions, as well as the common law tradition, have spread around the world through a
combination of conquest, imperialism, outright borrowing, and more subtle imitation.

The

resulting laws reflect both the influence of their families and the revisions specific to individual
countries.

As a result of this spread of legal families and the subsequent evolution of the laws, we

can compare both the individual legal rules and whole families across a large number of countries.
To this end, we have assembled a data set covering legal rules pertaining to the rights of
investors, and to the quality of enforcement of these rules, in 49 countries that have publicly
traded companies.

For shareholders, some of the rules we examine cover voting powers, ease of

5
participation in corporate voting, and legal protections against expropriation by management.

For

creditors, some of these rules cover the respect for security of the loan, the ability to grab assets
in case of a loan default, and the inability of management to seek protection from creditors
unilaterally.

In effect, these rules measure the ease with which investors can exercise their powers

against management.

We also consider measures of the quality of enforcement of legal rules in

different countries and of the quality of their accounting systems. These data allow us to tell
which countries protect what types of investors, and how well they do it. We can also find out
how much of the differences between national laws is explained by the legal origin of these laws,
Our analysis yields some striking results.

To begin, laws differ a great deal across

countries: an investor in France has very different legal rights than she does in Britain or Taiwan,
Moreover, a large part of this variation is accounted for by differences in legal origin, Civil laws
give investors weaker legal rights than common laws do. The most striking difference is between
common law countries, which give both shareholders and creditors the -- relatively speaking -strongest protections,

and French civil law countries, which protect investors the least. German

civil law and Scandinavian countries fall between common law and French civil law countries in
the strength of legal investor protection.

The quality of law enforcement is the highest in

Scandinavian and German civil law countries, next highest in common law countries, and again
the lowest in French civil law countries,

Finally, these results are not just a consequence of

different income levels in countries with different laws. All the evidence thus suggests the
weahess

of the legal protections afforded investors in French civil law countries compared to

those in common law countries, regardless of income levels.
But showing that law and its enforcement varies across countries and legal families is only

6
the beginning of the story. The nefi question is how do the countries with poor laws or their
enforcement cope with this problem?

Do their firms get no financing at all, or do these countries

have other, substitute mechanisms of corporate governance?

These mechanisms maybe in fact

incorporated into the law, or they may lie outside the law. In addition to establishing the
significant differences in investor protection across legal systems, this paper begins to examine
some of the possible adaptations to the lack of investor protection,
One potential adaptation to fewer laws is strong enforcement of laws, but as we pointed
out above this does not appear to be the case empirically.

Another possible -- legal -- adaptation,

which legal scholars sometimes refer to as “bright line” rules, is to legally introduce mandatory
standards of retention and distribution of capital to investors, which limit the opportunities
managerial expropriation.

for

Indeed, we find that French civil law countries are more likely to have

such bright line legal rules, namely mmdato~

dividends and maintenance of legal capital reserves,

than the rest of the countries.
Perhaps the most interesting adaptation to the lack of legal protections that we examine is
ownership concentration.

Some concentration

of ownership of a firm’s shares is typically efficient

to provide managers with an incentive to work, and large investors with an incentive to monitor
the managers (Jensen and Meckling 1976, Shleifer and Vishny 1986), However, some dispersion
of ownership among small investors is also desirable to diversifi risk. As argued by Shleifer and
Vishny (1996), ownership concentration

may actually become excessive when small investors do

not have enough legal rights to secure a return on their investment, and hence avoid holding
shares.

When the law protects investors, they can remain small and still hope to get something

back on their money, When the law does not protect them, investors have to be large and

2, Countries, Legal Families, and Legal Rules.
Countries
Most studies of corporate governance focus on one, or a few, wealthy economies (see,
e.g., Rajan and Zingales 1995, Berglof and Perotti 1994, Gorton and Schmidt 1995, Kaplan and
Minton 1994). However, corporate governance in all of the three economies that scholars
typically focus on -- the United States, Germany, and Japan -- is quite effective, To understand

8
better the role of legal protection of investors,

we need to examine a larger sample of countries,

To this end, we have assembled as comprehensive a sample as possible of countries that have
some non-financial firms traded on their stock exchanges.

The sample covers 49 countries from

Europe, North and South Americ~ Afi-ica, Asia, and Australia.

There are no socialist or

“transition” economies in the sample. A country is selected for inclusion i~ based on the

sample of 1$,900 firms from 33 countries and the Moody’s International sample of

15,100 non-U. S. firms from 92 countries, that country had at least five domestic non-financial
publicly traded firms in 1993. We restrict attention to countries that have publicly traded firms
since our primary focus is on protecting investor rights, and without public shareholders a
discussion of investor rights would be limited, Having at least five non-financial firms is also
essential for construction of ownership data,

Legal Families
Comparative legal scholars agree that, even though no two nations’ laws are exactly alike,
some national legal systems are sufficiently similar in certain critical respects to permit
classification of national legal systems into major families of law. Although there is no unanimity
among legal scholars on how to define legal families, “among the criteria often used for this
purpose are the following: (1) historical background and development of the legal system, (2)
theones and hierarchies of sources of law, (3) the working methodology
systems, (4) the characteristics

of jurists within the legal

of legal concepts employed by the system, (5) the legal institutions

of the system, and (6) the divisions of law employed within a system” (Glendon et al 1992, pp. 45),

Based on this approach, scholars identifi two broad legal traditions that pertain to matters

9
discussed in this paper: civil law and common Ia#,
The civil, or Romano-Germanic,

legal tradition is the oldest, the most itiuential,

and the

most widely distributed tradition around the world. It originates in Roman law, uses statutes and
comprehensive codes as a primary means of ordering legal material, and relies heavily on legal
scholars to ascertain and formulate its rules (Merryman 1969). Legal scholars typically identifi

(Glendon et d. 1994). When the Spanish and Portuguese

empires in Latin America dissolved in

the 19th century, it was mainly the French civil law that the lawmakers of the new nations looked
to for inspiration.

Our sample contains 21 countries with laws in the French civil tradition.

The German Commercial Code was written in 1897 afier Bismarck’s unification of
Germany, and perhaps because it was produced several decades later, was not as widely adopted
as the French Code. It had an important irdluence on the legal theory and doctrine in Austria,

2The religious traditions, such as Jewish law, Canon Law, Hindu law, and Muslim law,
appear to be less relevant in matters of investor protections. “Thus the Arabian countries
unquestionably belong to Islamic law as far as family and inheritance law is concerned, just as
India belongs to Hindu law, but economic law of these countries (including commercial law and
the law of contract and tort) is heavily impressed by the legal thinking of the colonial and
mandatory powers -- the Common Law in the case of India, French law in the case of most of the
Arab States” (Zweigert and Kotz 1987, p, 66). We focus on the principal secular legal traditions
in this study.

The family referred to as the common law tradition includes the law of England and those
laws modeled on English law. The common law is formed by judges who have to resolve specific
disputes.

of the Justinian’s Corpus Iuris to the codification, nation by nation, of abstract

rules. So common law comes horn the court, Continental Law from the study; the great jurists of
England were judges, on the Continent professors.

On the Continent lawyers, faced with a

problem, even a new and unforeseen one, ask what solution the rule provides; in England and the
United States they predict how the judge would deal with the problem, given existing decisions.

11
These differences in style run through the whole legal system. On the Continent lawyers think
abstractly, in terms of institutions; in England concretely, in terms of cases, the relationship of the
parties, ‘rights and duties.’ On the Continent, the system is conceived as being complete and free
from gaps, in England lawyers feel their way gradually from case to case. On the Continent
lawyers delight in systematic,

in England they are skeptical of every generalization.

To classify countries into legal ftilies,
American ~sociation

we rely principally on a publication of the

of Law Libraries called “Foreign Law: Current Sources of Codes and Basic

Legislation in Jurisdictions Around the World” (Reynolds and Flores, 1989), In most cases, such
classification is uncontroversial.

In some cases, however, while the basic origin of laws is clear,

laws over time have been amended to incorporate the needs of the adopting country as well as
influences from other ftilies.

For example, although Ecuador is a French civil law country, its

company law was revised in 1977 in part to incorporate some common law rules. Wer World
War II, the American occupying army changed some Japanese laws, although their basic German
civil law structure remained.

While Italian laws originate in the French tradition, over years they

had some German influence. In all these -- and several other -- cases, we have classified a country
based on the original structure of the laws it adopted, rather than on the revisions.
One potential difficulty for our classification is posed by the attempt to harmonize West
European laws currently underway in the European Community (Andenas and Kenyon-Slade
1993, Werlauff 1993).

The Community has issued several directives designed to uni~ European

commercial laws, including some of the laws that pertain to corporate governance.

Several

12
countries have changed their laws to adhere to EC directives.

However, in most instances, the

directives are not mandatory, and the countries are given some time to change their laws.
Moreover, the EC directives accommodate
1993 -1994--

a great deal of diversity between countries.

As of

the point in time when we examine the legal rules of the countries in our sample --

EC harmonization has not generally affected the legal rules that we focus on. The one area where
the EC impact has been large, namely mergers and acquisitions, is not an area that we examine in
this paper (see below).

Legal Rules
In this paper, we look at a fairly narrow range of differences between laws, namely those
pertaining to investor protection,
bankruptcy/ reorganization

To this end, we examine two types of laws: company laws and

laws. Company laws exist in all countries, and are concerned with (1)

the legal relations between corporate insiders (members of the corporation,

i.e., shareholders,

directors) and the corporation itself and (2) the legal relations between the corporation and
certain outsiders, particularly creditors,

Bankruptcy/ reorganization

laws apply more generally

than just to companies, but deal specifically with procedures that unfold in the case of failure to
pay back debt, All these laws are part of the commercial codes in civil law countries, and exist as
separate laws, mainly in the form of Acts, in common law countries.
Although the focus on these two sources of law gives us a lot of data, there are several
conspicuous omissions from the data set. First, this paper says little about merger and takeover
rules, except indirectly by looking at voting mechanisms,

These rules are spread between

company laws, anti-trust laws, security laws, stock exchange regulations, and sometimes banking

13
regulations as well, Moreover, these rules have changed significantly in Europe as part of EC
legal harmonization.

Until now, takeovers have been an important governance tool mainly in a

few civil law countries, although the situation may change, We defer an analysis of these rules to
a separate paper,
Second, this paper also says little about disclosure rules, which again come from many
sources, including comp~y

laws, security laws, and stock exchange regulations, and are also

intended for harmonization

across the European Community

One important caveat here is that

we do look at the quality of accounting standards, which to a significant extent is a consequence
of the disclosure rules.
Third, we do not in this paper use any information from regulations imposed by security
exchanges.

One instance where this is relevant is exchange-imposed

restrictions on the voting

rights for the shares that companies can issue if these shares are to be traded on the exchange.
Finally, a potentially important set of rules that we do not deal with here is banking and
financial institution regulations, which might take the form of restricting bank ownership, for
example, Much has been made of these regulations in the United States by Roe (1994).

Again,

we defer their codification and examination to fiture work.
An inspection of company and bankruptcy laws suggests numerous potentially measurable
differences among countries.

Here we focus only on some of the most basic rules that observers

of corporate governance around the world (e.g., Paul Vishny 1994, Investor Responsibility
Research Center 1994, Institutional

Shareholder Sefices

1994, White 1993, American Bar

Association 1989 and 1993) believe to be critical to the quality of shareholder and creditor legal
rights. Moreover, we focus on variables that prima facie are interpretable as either pro-investor

14
or pro-management,
legal ftilies.

since this is the dimension along which we are trying to assess countries and

There are obvious differences in rules between countries, such as for example tier

structures of boards of directors, that we do not examine because we cannot ascertain which of
these rules are more sympathetic to shareholders.

Investor rights, as well as the other variables

we use in this paper, are summarized in Table 1. We discuss individual variables in more detail in
the sections where they we analyzed.

The Appendix summarizes by country the data sources that

were used to construct the data set3.

Some Conceptual Issues
The goal of our research, as we already mentioned, is to establish whether laws pertaining
to investor protection differ across countries and whether these differences have consequences for
corporate finance. This research design immediately poses some conceptual problems.
some scholars, such as Easterbrook

To begin,

and Fischel (1991), are skeptical that legal rules are binding in

most instances, since ofien firms can opt out of these rules in their corporate charters, which
effectively serve as contracts between entrepreneurs and investors,

Indeed, in many countries,

firms can opt out of some of the rules we examine. As a practical matter, however, it maybe
costly for firms to opt out of standard legal rules since investors might have difficulty accepting
non-standard

contracts and, more importantly, judges might ftil to understand or enforce them,

Perhaps for this reason, standard legal rules appear to have some bite, Even more important, the

3The data collected for this paper come from multiple sources, ranging from publicly and
commercially available data sets, to respective countries’ laws and commentaries on these laws.
We have been able to obtain nearly complete data for over 45 countries, and taken some care to
assure their accuracy. The tables in this paper present all the data on legal rights and their
enforcement that we use in the analysis.

15
question of whether legal rules matter is fundamentally empirical: if opting out were cheap and
simple, we would not find that legal rules matter for patterns of corporate ownership and finance
Even if we were to find that legal rules matter, it would be possible to argue that these
rules endogenously adjust to economic reality, and hence the differences in rules and outcomes
simply reflect the differences in some other, exogenous conditions across countries.

Perhaps

some countries chose to have ordy bank finance of firms for political reasons, and then adjusted
their laws accordingly to protect banks and discourage shareholders.

For some individual rules,

this is surely the case, However, this is where our focus on the legal origin becomes crucial.
Countries typically adopted their legal systems involuntarily (through conquest or colonization),
and even when they chose a legal system freely, as in the case of former Spanish colonies, the
crucial consideration was language and the broad political stance of the law rather than the
treatment of investor protections.

The legal family can therefore be treated as exogenous to a

country’s structure of corporate ownership and finance.
substantially across legal ftilies,
strong case that legal ftilies,

If we find that legal rules differ

and that so do financing and ownership patterns, we have a

as expressed in the legal rules, actually affect outcomes,

Finally, this paper takes the rather standard point of view that investor protections
contribute to external financing of firms, and hence to economic efficiency.

This need not

necessarily be the case, A country might develop and grow with limited legal protections of
outside investors, and with only internal and state finance of firms, Our paper does not address
this theoretical issue; it rather relies on the existing research (sumeyed, e.g., by Shleifer and
Vishny 1996) to presume that investor protections are good for economic efficiency.

16
3, Shareholder rights.
We begin by considering shareholder rights from company laws. Because shareholders
exercise their power by voting for directors, experts focus on voting procedures in evaluating
shareholder rights. These include: voting rights attached to shares, rights that support the voting
mechanism against interference by the insiders, and what we call remedial rights. To begin,
investors may be better protected when dividend rights are tightly linked to voting rights, i,e.
companies in a country are subject to one-share-one-vote

rules (Grossman and Hart 1988, Harris

and Raviv 1988)4. The idea is that, when votes are tied to dividends, insiders cannot appropriate
cash flows to themselves by controlling ordy a small share of the company’s cash flows but still
maintaining voting control.

There are many ways out of the one-share-one-vote

laws in different countries accommodate.

principle that

Companies can issue non-voting shares, low and high-

voting shares, founders’ shares with extremely high voting rights, or shares whose votes increase
when they are held longer, as in France.

Companies can also restrict the total number of votes

that any given shareholder can exercise at a shareholders’ meeting, regardless of how many votes
he controls,

We say that a country has one-share one-vote if none of these practices is allowed by

law. In our sample, only 11 countries impose genuine one-share one-vote rules,
The next five rights are much more straightforward,

and essentially describe how easy it is

for shareholders to exercise their voting rights, Because these rights measure how strongly the
legal system favors shareholders (against managers) in the voting process, we refer to them as
anti-director rights. First, in some countries, shareholders must show up in person, or send an

It does not appear that this directive is being incorporated

to a shareholders’ meeting to be able to vote, In other countries, in

contrast, they can vote by mail, which makes it easier for them to cast their votes, In Japan, for
example, about 80 percent of companies hold their annual meeting on the same week, and voting
by mail is not allowed, which makes it difficult for shareholders to exercise their votes unless they
go through a legal procedure of designating their proxies at the meetings.
Second, in some gountries, law requires that shareholders deposit their shares with the
company or a financial intermediary several days prior to a shareholder meeting.
then kept in custody until a few days after the meeting.

The shares are

This practice prevents shareholders from

selling their shares for several days around the time of the meeting, and keeps shareholders who
do not bother to go through this exercise from voting,
Third, some countries allow cumulative voting for directors, which in principle gives more
power for minority shareholders to put their representatives

on boards of directors.

Fourth, some countries give minority shareholders legal mechanisms to be used against
perceived oppression by directors.

These mechanisms may include the right to sue directors (as in

the American derivative suits) or the right to force the company to purchase shares of the
shareholders who object to certain fundamental changes, such as mergers or asset sales.
Fifth, we look at the percentage of share capital needed to call an extraordinary
shareholders’ meeting.

Presumably, the higher this percentage is, the harder it is for minority

shareholders to organize a meeting to challenge or oust the management.

This percentage varies

around the world from 1 percent in some U. S. states to 33 percent of share capital in Mexico.
Finally, we combine these five anti-director rights into an aggregate anti-director rights
measure described in Table 1.

18
The last shareholder rights measure, which we treat a bit differently from others, is the
right to a mandatory dividend. In some countries, companies are mandated by law to pay out a
certain fraction of their declared earnings as dividends,

Earnings of course can be misrepresented

within the limits allowed by the accounting system, so this measure is not as tough as it looks, but
at least it prevents declarations of high earnings, which might be needed to raise additional finds,
without dividend payouts.

The mandatory dividend right may be needed when other rights of

shareholders are too weak to induce them to invest. We test this hypothesis in Section 5.
Table 2 presents the data on shareholder rights, where the vrdues of all variables are listed
by country, and countries are organized by legal origin. Columns in Table 2 generally correspond
to particular legal provisions concerning shareholder rights, and the values in the tables are
dummies indicating whether a country has the particular legal provision.

Table 2 also presents

equality of means tests for all the variables by origin.
An examination of world means of the variables in Tables 2 suggests that relatively few
countries have legal rules favoring outside shareholders.

Ordy 22 percent of the countries have

one share one vote, ordy 16 percent allow cumulative voting, ordy 22 percent allow voting by
mail, and only 53 percent protect oppressed minorities.

One could argue that other -- private --

mechanisms facilitate external equity finance, such as the managerial reputations (Gomes 1996).
The point here is only that shareholder protections do not very ofien come from legal rules.
The other clear result in Table 2 is that, for many variables, the origin of laws matters.
Although we present more formal statistical tests of this proposition later in this section, Table 2
shows that the means of shareholder rights variables are statistically significantly different between
origins. Two variables where most origins are similar are one-share-one-vote,

which is an

19
uncommon restriction everywhere (and never happens in Scandinavia, which is therefore
different), and cumulative voting, which is also uncommon everywhere (and never happens in
Scandinavia, which is therefore different).

With other variables, the differences in shareholder

rights between legal origins are more substantial,
Specifically, two major facts emerge from Table 2. First, along a variety of dimensions,
common law countries word the best legal protections to shareholders.

They most frequently

(39%) allow shareholders to vote by mail, they never block shares for shareholder meetings, they
have the highest (92Yo) incidence of laws protecting oppressed minorities, and they generally
require relatively few shares (90A) to call an extraordinary shareholder meeting.
they also have the highest of all legal ftilies

Not surprisingly,

aggregate anti-director rights score (3.39), including

the only perfect 5 for the United States. Many of these differences between common law and civil
law countries are statistically significant.

In short, relative to the rest of the world, common law

countries have a better package of laws protecting shareholders.
Second, along a broad range of dimensions, French civil law countries afford the worst
legal protections to shareholders.

Although they look average on one-share-one-vote

(24%) and

cumulative voting (190A), they have the lowest (90A) incidence of allowing voting by mail, a high
(43%, though not as high as German civil law countries) incidence of blocking shares for
shareholder meetings, a low (3 3°/0, though not as low as Nordic countries) incidence of laws
protecting oppressed minorities, and the highest (14%) percentage of share capital needed to call
an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting.

On the aggregate anti-director rights measure, French

civil law countries look the worst (1. 76), The differences between French civil law and common
law are large and statistically significant, although other civil law families are not evidently more

20
protective of shareholders than the French civil law countries are, Interestingly, even France
itself, except for allowing proxies by mail, does not have good legal protections of shareholders.
These results suggest that shareholders in the two most widely-spread legal regimes: common law
and French civil law, operate in very different legal environments.
The Germm civil law countries are in general located between the two extremes, but
closer to the French family.

They have a relatively high frequency of one-share one-vote rules

(because of East Aia) and require relatively few votes to call an extraordinary meeting, but they
also typically block shares for shareholder meetings and rarely allow voting by mail. The average
anti-director score for this family is 2.00 -- closer to the French family than to the common law
family, Scandinavia presents a mixed picture, with an aggregate anti-director score of 2,50, For
example, only Denmark appears to have oppressed minority protections,

and only Norway allows

voting by mail,
The one remedial measure in Table 2, namely mandatory dividend, shows that mandatory
dividends are used on~ in French civil law countries.

This result is broadly consistent with the

rest of our evidence, and suggests that mandatory dividends are indeed a remedial legal protection
for shareholders who have relatively few other legal rights.
The final task of this section is to ask whether, in a statistical sense, once we consider all
the legal rules at once, legal origin matters,

In addressing this question, we must examine

shareholder and creditor rights together, even though we discuss the results on creditor rights in
the next section,

We can also deal with another potential concern (addressed in more detail in

section 7), namely that differences in legal origin just reflect differences in per capita income
levels, Accordingly, we estimate a stacked regression using all the variables from Table 2 (other

21
than the aggregate anti-director variable) plus the five creditor rights (described in Table 3 and the
next section) as dependent variables, and origin dummies and levels of GNP per capita in each
country as independent variables.

Because within a country specific laws are correlated with each

other, the appropriate estimation method is Seemingly Unrelated Regression.

We can then

perform F-tests of the hypothesis that origin matters for shareholder rights. The results of the
regressions are presented in Table 4, and the F-tests in Table 5,
The results in Table 4 cofirm

the findings of Table 2 that civil law, and especially French

civil law, countries have inferior protections of shareholders to those of the common law
countries.

Controlling for per capita income does not change this result (we return to per capita

income in section 7). The tests in Panel A of Table 5 furthermore show that, even controlling for
per capita income levels, legal origin matters for laws protecting shareholders,
cofidence,

With reasonable

we can reject the hypothesis that any given origin has the same laws as the rest of the

world, Moreover, the table shows that the two origins that are most different from the others are
French civil law and common law. We can also reject the hypotheses that the laws in the German
family are the same as those in either the French or the common law fmilies.
These formal tests are consistent with the principal finding of this section, namely that
common law countries have the relatively better protections of shareholders, and the French civil
law countries have the worst ones5. A minority shareholder in Australia or South Africa can vote

5Some European legal scholars have objected to this conclusion on the grounds that our
selection of variables was biased toward finding common law countries more protective of
investors. One variable that these scholars objected to our not using is the mandato~ preemptive
right to buy new shares given by many European countries to the existing shareholders.
Originally, this right did not appear to us to be critical, which is why we did not include it. Mer
this criticism, we have analyzed the data on this right, although we did not include the results in
the basic tables since this right was selected to favor civil law countries, As it happens, 56

22
by mail, can trade his shares during a shareholders’ meeting, is protected from certain
expropriations by directors, and needs to have only 5°/0 of share capital to call an extraordinary
meeting. A minority shareholder in Italy or Belgium, in contrast, cannot vote by mail, has tis
shares blocked during the shareholder meeting, is not protected from expropriation by directors
and needs to have 20°/0 of share capital to call for an extraordinary meeting.

The differences

between legal origins come out loud and clear from this analysis of shareholder rights.

4. Creditor Rights.
Conceptually,

creditor rights are more complex than shareholder rights. The reason is that

creditors exercise their power in several ways. Perhaps the most basic creditor right is the right to
repossess -- and then liquidate or keep -- collateral when a loan is in default (see Hart 1995).
For collateralized loans, the power of creditors against borrowers depends largely on the ease of
repossessing collateral.

In some countries, law makes it difficult for the lenders to repossess

collateral, in part because such repossession leads to liquidation of firms that is viewed as socially
undesirable.

In these countries, lenders may still have some powers against borrowers, namely

their votes in the decisions for how to reorganize the company and pay off the creditors.

The

creditor rights that experts consider to be essential for debt finance are the rights to repossess
collateral and to have a say in reorganization

(see Paul Vishny 1994, Aghion, Hart, and Moore

percent of common law countries have this rule, compared to 76 percent of French civil law
countries (t = 1.36), 50 percent of German civil law countries (t = .23 in the comparison to
common law), and 100 percent of Scandinavian countries ( t = -3.69 in the comparison to
common law). Thus the principal comparison of common law to French, and even German, civil
law families is not materially affected by the inclusion of this variable. We have also checked all
our firther results and none are affected by the inclusion of this measure of preemptive
shareholder rights.

23
1992, Baird 1995, White 1993).
We use five creditor rights variables in this analysis. First, in some countries, the
reorganization procedure imposes an automatic stay on the assets, thereby preventing secured
creditors from getting possession of loan collateral.

This rule obviously protects managers and

unsecured creditors against secured creditors and prevents automatic liquidation.

In Greece, for

example, secured credito~s have the right for foreclose on their property when their claim matures
and not when the borrower defaults (Guide to Insolvency in Europe 1989, p, 112). In other
countries, in contrast, secured creditors can pull collateral from firms being reorganized without
waiting for completion of reorgtition.
Second, some countries do not assure the secured creditors the right to collateral in
reorganization.

In these, admittedly rare, countries, secured creditors are in line behind the

Third, with respect to reorganizatio~

management in some countries can seek protection

from creditors unilaterally by filing for reorgtiation,

without creditor consent,

Such protection

is called Chapter 11 in the United States, and gives management a great deal of power against
creditors, since at best creditors can get their money or collateral only with a delay. In other
countries, in contrast, creditor consent is needed to file for reorganization,

and hence managers

cannot so easily escape creditor demands.
Finally, in some countries, management stays pending the resolution of the reorganization
procedure, whereas in other countries, such as Malaysia, management is replaced by a party

24
appointed by the court or the creditors,

This threat of dismissal may enhance creditors’ power.

As with shareholder rights, we use one remedial creditor rights measure, namely the
existence of a legal reserve requirement.

This requirement forces firms to maintain a certain level

of capital to avoid automatic liquidation.

It protects creditors when they have few other powers

in that it forces an automatic liquidation before all the capital is stolen or wasted by the insiders.
The results on creditor rights are presented in Table 3, which is organized in the same way
as Table 2. In general, the protections of creditor rights analyzed here are more common than the
protections of shareholder rights. Over half the countries restrict the managers’ right to seek
protection from creditors unilaterally, 85 percent pay secured creditors first, nearly half do not
have automatic stay on assets, and 43 percent remove management in reorganization

proceedings,

As in Table 2, we see that, for many creditor rights, the legal origin matters (again we defer the Ftests to the end of this section).

Moreover, the ranking of origins by the extent of investor

protection is similar for creditors to what it is for shareholders.
Common law countries offer creditors better legal protections against managers.

They

most frequently (710/0, roughly tied with Scandinavia) preclude managers from unilaterally seeking
court protection from creditors; they have the lowest (29°/0) incidence of allowing automatic stay
on assets; with one exception, they guarantee that secured creditors are paid first (as do German
civil law and Scandinavian families); and they have far and away the lowest (24°/0) incidence of
managers staying on the job in reorganization

proceedings.

The United States is actually one of

the most anti-creditor common law countries: it allows unimpeded petition for reorganization,
permits automatic stay on assets, and lets managers keep their jobs in reorganization.
Creditor rights results also resemble those for shareholder rights in that the French civil

25
law countries offer creditors the weakest protections.

Few of them (42Y0 -- still more than

German civil law countries) place restrictions on managers seeking court protection from
creditors, many (74°/0, tied with Scandinavia) allow the automatic stay on assets, relatively few
(68%) assure that secured creditors are paid first, and the vast majority (74%, though not as many
as in Scandinavia) allow managers to stay on the job in reorganization
On some measure,s, countries in the German civil law ftily

are strongly pro-creditor.

For

instance, relatively few (3 3°/0) of them allow automatic stay and secured creditors in all of them
are paid first. On the other hand, relatively few of these countries (33°/0) prevent managers fi-om
getting protection from creditors unilaterally, and most (67VO)allow managers to stay in
reorganization.

One view of this evidence is that the German civil law countries are very

responsive to secured creditors by not allowing automatic stay and by letting them pull collateral,
As a consequence of making liquidation easy, these countries rely lesson reorganization

of

defaulting firms, and hence being sofi on such firms by letting managers stay may not be a big
problem.

Scandinavia, as before, has some pro-management

and some pro-creditor laws. The

main differences, as with shareholders, are between common law and French civil law countries.
The evidence on the one remedial pro-creditor

legal rule in the sample, namely the legal

reserve requirement, is consistent with the rest of our findings. Specifically, these requirements
almost never exist in common law countries, where other investor protections presumably suffice.
On the other hand, these requirements are more common in all civil law countries,

Since legal

reserve requirements are likely to protect unsecured creditors in particular, it is not surprising that
they are relatively common in the German civil law countries, which tend to be as bad as the
French civil law countries in treating unsecured creditors.

Remedial rights, then, are used when

26
other investor powers are insufficient to enable them to earn returns on their investments.
From this analysis, it appears that the ranking of origins is roughly the same for creditor
and shareholder protections.

Some legal ftilies

-- relatively speaking -- protect all investors, and

others protect none. It does not appear that some legal ftilies
protect creditors.

protect shareholders and others

We can ask this question more formally by looking at the correlations, across

countries, between shareholder and creditor rights measures.

This is done in Table 6. The results

do not support the hypothesis that countries protect either shareholders or creditors, and if
anything, suggest the reverse. For example, the correlation of oppressed minority rights is .08
with restrictions on managers unilaterally seeking protection from creditors, -.23 with having an
automatic stay on assets, ,18 with having secured creditors first in line, and -,33 with managers
staying in reorganization.

In short, we have no systematic evidence that legal rules discriminate

between investor types, except that German civil law countries are partial to secured creditors.
Next, we return to Tables 4 and 5 and formally ask the question whether origin matters for
creditor rights, Table 4 confirms the results in Table 3 that, for several creditor rights, origin
matters, even after controlling for per capita income. The formal tests show even more strongly
than for shareholder rights that origin matters.

Every family of laws (other than Nordic) is

statistically different from the rest of the world, and common law countries are different from civil
law countries.

We can reject the hypothesis that French civil law countries have the same creditor

rights as German civil law countries.

Although we try to examine all the components of the legal system, the superiority of common
law, and inferiority of the French civil law, in protecting investors is a key finding of our paper.

5. Enforcement.

bWe have also conducted these tests controlling for geography, dividing the world into
Australia, Europe, Afi-ica, Asia, and America. In the combined comparison of shareholder and
creditor rights, only the difference between Scandinavia and the rest of the world loses
significance; all the remaining differences remain highly statistically significant.

courts can step in and rescue investors

To address these issues, in addition to measures of investors’ legal

rights, this paper examines proxies for the quality of enforcement of these rights, namely estimates
of “law and order” in different countries compiled by credit risk agencies.

These measures are

collected by private firms for the use of foreign investors interested in doing btisiness in the
respective countries.

We use five of these measures: efficiency of the judicial system, rule of law,

corruption, risk of expropriation

-- by

The first two of these

measures obviously pertain to law enforcement proper; the last three deal more generally with the
government’s stance toward business.

Some of these measures have been previously shown to

affect national growth rates (Keefer and Knack 1995).
In addition to these rule of law variables, this study uses an estimate of the quality of a

important, contracts between managers and investors typically rely on some measures of firms’

Table 7 examines country scores on the various rule of law measures, as well as on their

As before, it arranges countries by legal origin, and presents tests of

equality of means between families. The table suggests that quality of law enforcement differs
across legal ftilies.

However, the picture is different from that for the legal rules.

‘The measure of accounting standards we use was published in 1991, At around the same
time, European countries began to harmonize their accounting standards under the pressure from

quality of standards are obviously more important than the fiture convergence.

30
civil law countries retain their last place,
These results do not support the conclusion that the quality of law enforcement
compensates for the quality of laws. An investor in a French civil law country is poorly protected
by both the laws and the system that enforces them. The converse is true for an investor in a
common law country, on average.
An inspection Table 7 suggests that, for the enforcement measures, the level of per capita
income may have a more important confounding effect than it did for the laws themselves.

In

Table 8, we investigate whether quality of enforcement is different in different legal families
through regression analysis across countries.
level of per capita income,

In the regressions, we control for each country’s

The omitted dummy in the regressions is for common law countries.

By every single measure, richer countries have higher quality of law enforcement.
Nonetheless, even controlling for per capita income, the legal family matters for the quality of
enforcement and the accounting standards.

A great deal of the cross-sectional

variance in these

rule of law scores is explained by per capita income and the legal origin. In some cases, these
variables together explain around 80 percent of the cross-sectional

variation in rule of law scores,

with the lion’s share of the explanatory power coming from per capita income.
Once income is controlled for, the conclusions change somewhat.

French civil law

countries still score lower on every single measure, and statistically significantly lower for almost
all measures, than the common law countries do, However, once per capita income is controlled
for, German civil law countries tend to score lower than the common law countries on all
measures other than repudiation of contracts by govement,

although the effect is significant only

for the efficiency of the judiciary and the accounting standards.

Scandinavian countries are

32
the more elaborate legal rules, such as protections of oppressed minorities, might require
sophisticated accounting standards, so that, in the absence of such standards, a legal system may
need to resort to remedial measures.

Finally, the results show quite clearly that, relative to

common law countries, remedial rules are more likely to exist in civil law countries.

Consistent

with our earlier findings, these results point to the need for remedial laws in countries where other
laws protect investors the least, In SUQ the results in Table 9 are consistent with the hypothesis
that remedial laws are an adaptation to poor laws protecting investors and to poor enforcement of
laws, including poor accounting standards.

6. Ownership,
In this section, we explore the hypothesis that companies in countries with poor
protections of investors adapt through concentrated

ownership of their shares. The idea is that,

when investors have relatively few legal rights, then managers can be induced to return the money
to these investors is if one, or a very small number, of investors own the majority of shares.
Moreover, it is unattractive to be a small investor in such a company, since one is bound to be
expropriated by either the managers or the large investors, including the banks, themselves.

In

contrast, when legal protections are stronger, it is possible for ownership to be more dispersed
and for small investors to expect a return on their capital. It may still be desirable to have some
ownership concentration,

since large shareholders might monitor managers and thus increase the

value of the firm (Shleifer and Vishny 1986), With stronger legal protections,

however, small

investors can expect to benefit from these efforts by large shareholders, and hence some
ownership dispersion is possible.

This tradeoff between legal protections and ownership

33
concentration,

stressed by Shleifer and Vishny (1996), is tested below,

To this end, we have assembled a data base of up to 10 largest by market capitalization
non-financial (i.e., no banks) domestic (i. e., no foreign multinationals) publicly traded (i.e., not
100% privately or government held) companies in each country in our sample.

in a few countries (13rtil, Austri~ Egypt).

This changed the list substantially

For some countries, including Egypt, India, Nigeria,

Philippines, and Zimbabwe, we could not find 10 such companies and settled for at least five.
For each company, we collected data on its three largest shareholders, and computed the
combined (cash flow) ownership stake of these three shareholders.

We did not correct for the

possibility that some of the large shareholders are affiliated with each other, or that the company
itself owns the shares of its shareholders (both of these corrections would raise effective
concentration),

Nor could we distinguish empirically between large shareholders who are the

with the management, or separate from the management.

It is not clear

that a conceptual line between management and, say, a 40 percent shareholder can be drawn,

are getting the concentration

each country, and have a separate variable for ownership concentration using all owners, using
private owners only, and using private owners in the largest companies that have no government
ownership.

As in turns out, government ownership of shares in publicly traded companies is not

that commo~ and hence the results are not particularly affected by the corrections for government
ownership.

We therefore discuss the results for the companies with no government ownership.

Note finally that we have been able to obtain ownership data for 45 out of our 49 countries.
Table 10 contains perhaps the single most surprising finding of our paper. In the world as
a whole, even if we focus on the largest publicly traded companies, the average ownership of the
three largest shareholders is 46 percent, with the median of 45 percent.

Dispersed ownership in

large public companies is simply a myth. Even in the United States, the average for the 10 most
valuable companies is 20 percent (which is partly explained by the fact that Microsoft, Walmart,
Coca-Cola, and Intel are on the list and all have significant ownership concentration),
median is 12 percent.

The average concentration

and the

measure we use is under 30 percent only for the

United States, Australia, United Kingdom, Taiwan, Japan, Korea and Sweden.

Presumably, if we

looked at smaller companies, the numbers we would get for ownership concentration

would be

even larger, The finance textbook model of management faced by multitudes of dispersed
shareholders is an exception and not the rule.
Table 10 also shows that ownership concentration varies by legal origin. By far the
highest concentration

of ownership is found in the French civil law countries, with the average

ownership by the three largest shareholders of a whopping 54 percent for the 10 largest nongovemment firms. The lowest concentration

is in the German civil law countries, and is equal to

The differences between the French civil law countries and other legal

families are statistically significant, although other differences are not. In sum, these data indicate
that the French civil law $ountries have unusually high ownership concentratio~

just like they

have unusually poor legal protections of investors and enforcement of laws. These results are at
least suggestive that concentration

of ownership is a response to poor legal protection.

In Table 11, we examine empirically the determinants of ownership concentration,
steps. First, we regress ownership concentration
variables, to see whether origin matters,

in two

The controls we use are: (the logarithm o~ GNP per

capita on the theory that richer countries may have different ownership patterns;

(the logarithm

o~ total GNP on the theory that larger economies have larger firms which might therefore have
lower ownership concentration;

and the Gini coefficient for a country’s income on the theory --

suggested to us by several readers -- that more unequal societies have higher ownership
concentration.

Second, we add to the first regression several measures of legal protections,

including accounting standards, enforcement quality, shareholder rights, creditor rights, and the
remedial rights. Given the large number of variables collected for this paper, we cannot estimate
all the possible regressions, and we need to make some choices. We pick “rule of law” as our
measure of quality of etiorcement,

ownership and small stock markets might have little use for

good accounting standards, and so ftil to develop them. The causality in this case would be from
ownership concentration

to accounting standards, rather than the other way around,

Since we

have no instruments that we believe determine accounting but not ownership concentration,

we

cannot reject this hypothesis, although we do not find it as plausible as ours. Of course, the legal
rules that we use as our independent variables, and the legal ongins that shape these rules, are
more likely to be exogenous to ownership concentration.
In sum, the message of Table 11 is that the quality of legal protection of shareholders, as
well as the extent of protection of the voting process against manipulation by directors, are
significant determinants of ownership concentration.

7. Per capita income.
In the previous sections, we have presented results in which we controlled for per capita
income in assessing the dtierences

between the legal ftilies.

We have established that per capita

income is not the whole story. In this sectioq we focus on per capita income itself as a
determinant of a country’s law and its etiorcement.

Do poor countries have systematically worse

legal protections than rich countries do? If this were the case, then the possibility would exist
that poor countries are stuck in a bad equilibrium of inadequate legal protection and scarce
external finance, which would stunt growth and therefore keep them poor and with inadequate
legal protection.

On the other hand, if per capita income is not a critical determinant of effective

legal protection, then even if poor laws slow down financing and investment, countries can still
grow out of the trap. In this sectio~ we attempt to shed some light on these issues.
In Table 12, we sort countries by per capita income into the bottom quartile, middle 50
percent, and the top quartile.
capita income groups.

We then compare the means of some of our variables across per

Shareholder rights do not systematically depend on the level of per capita

income. Table 12 shows this for the aggregate quality of shareholder rights variable, but the
result holds for individual rights as well. The unimportance

of per capita income as a determinant

39
of shareholder rights is apparent from the regressions in Table 4, which control for legal origin.
Table 12 also suggests that some of the creditor rights, such as the restriction on
managers’ right to unilaterally seek protection from creditors, no automatic stay on assets, and
the replacement of managers in bankruptcy proceedings, actually get weaker in richer countries.
Some of these results, in weaker form, appear in the regressions in Table 4, which control for
legal origin. Interestingly, the one measure that rises most clearly with income is management
staying in reorganization.

It is possible that the relative anti-management

stance of poor

countries’ bankruptcy laws is dictated by efficiency: unless creditors get their hands on the assets
fast, these assets are likely to disappear.

It is also possible that, in richer countries, management

lobbying has succeeded in emasculating creditor rights. The aggressive pro-management
of the U.S. bankruptcy law is consistent with both of these interpretations.

stance

In any event, there is

no evidence that poor countries have weaker creditor rights.
As we already reported in Table 8, however, the efficiency of the judicial system and rule
of law both increase substantially with the level of income. In fact, per capita G~

measures.

alone explains

The quality of the accounting standards also

rises sharply with per capita income, although we have very few observations for the poorer
countries,

The picture is thus very different for law enforcement than it is for legal rules.

In summary, the data provide no evidence of a legal trap: systematically weaker laws
protecting investors in poorer countries.

There is no systematic correlation between income and

shareholder rights, and, if anything, some creditor rights are weaker in richer countries.

What this

means is that some countries -- such as Italy and France -- have managed to get rich despite
having few laws that protect investors.

On the other hand, richer countries have a clearly higher

40
quality of law enforcement,

The failure of poor countries to consistently etiorce basic investor

protections may well help keep them poor.

8. Conclusions.
In this paper, we have examined laws governing investor protection, the quality of
enforcement of these laws, and ownership concentration

in 49 countries around the world.

The

analysis suggests three broad conclusions.
First, laws differ markedly around the world, though in most places they tend to give
investors a rather limited bundle of rights. In particular, countries whose legal rules originate in
the common law tradition tend to protect investors considerably better than do the countries
whose laws originate in the civil law, and especially the French civil law, tradition.

The German

civil law and the Scandinavian countries take an intermediate stance toward investor protections.
There is no clear evidence that different countries favor different types of investors; the evidence
rather points to a relatively stronger stance favoring all investors in common law countries.

This

evidence confirms our basic hypothesis that being a shareholder, or a creditor, in different legal
jurisdictions entitles an investor to very different bundles of rights. These rights are determined
by laws; they are not inherent in securities themselves.
Second, law etiorcement

differs a great deal around the world.

German civil law and

Scandinavian countries have the best quality of law enforcement, although this reflects to some
extent their higher average income levels, Law enforcement is strong in common law countries as
well, whereas it is the weakest in the French civil law countries.

These rankings also hold for one

critical input into law enforcement in the area of investor protections: the accounting standards.

41
These standards are ranked the lowest in the French civil law countries, where an investor is
generally protected neither by the laws nor by high quality law enforcement.

The quality of law

enforcement, unlike the legal rights themselves, improves sharply with the level of income.
Third, we have examined the concentration

of ownership in publicly traded companies

around the world, and investigated the hypothesis that highly concentrated

ownership is an

adaptive response to poor investor protection in a corporate governance system. To begin, we
have shown that ownership concentration

is extremely high around the world, consistent with our

evidence that laws, on average, are not terribly protective of investors.

In an average country,

close to half the equity in a publicly traded company is owned by the three largest shareholders.
Good accounting standards, rule of law, and shareholder protection measures are highly
negatively correlated with the concentration
protection of investors maybe costly.

of ownership.

Specifically, if small investors are not protected,

companies would not be able to raise capital from the~
diversi~ their holdings.

These results suggest that inadequate

High ownership concentration,

and entrepreneurs would not be able to
then, may be a symptom of a poorly

functioning capital market.
These findings leave us with a puzzle. The most widely spread legal family, that
originating in the French civil law, appears to have the worst efficiency properties from the
perspective of corporate governance.

While this system was often not adopted voluntarily, it was

chosen by at least some governments,

and has survived for decades around the world. How can

it be so popular it as our results suggest, it is so bad? One possible answer is that, when
countries adopt a legal system, their leaders are more focused on its revolutionary spirit and on
the more basic rights than those of investors.

The legal reformers borrow the legal systems

42
wholesale, without excessive focus on whether shareholders can vote by mail. Another possible
answer -- related to arguments made in Easterbrook

and Fischel (1991) -- is that the legal system

does not matter very much, and that investors can generally contract around the limitations of the
legal system. This answer, however, does not square with our evidence on ownership if one
believes that extreme ownership concentration
these arguments, the suMv~

is costly,

Even if one gives some credence to

and spread of rules that appew so inferior remains puzzling,

The ultimate question that needs to be answered to deal with this puzzle, of course, is
whether countries with poor investor protections -- either laws or their enforcement -- actually do
suffer. Do such countries, especidy

the French civil law countries, have smaller capital markets?

Are their banking systems less developed?

Are companies in these countries incapable of getting

external finance? We defer this analysis to our follow-up paper, and for now leave the puzzle
open.

TABLE 5: Legal Origin, Shareholder and Creditor Rights
The following table reports F-tests based on a SURE regression model. The dependent variable is the stack of shareholder and creditor
righ~ by mun~ and the independent variables are the log of GNP per capita and the set of dummies for the different legal origins. The
four legal origins are: (1) English; (2) French; (3) German; and (4) Scandinavian . Panel A reports F-tests on the significance of legal
origins for the set of shareholders’ rights. Panel B repofi F-tests on the significance of legal origins for the set of creditors’ rights. Finally,
panel C reports F-tests on the significance of legal origins for both sets of shareholder and creditor righm together. F-statistics are reported
with theu-associated probabili~ underneath

Origins,

Rule of Law and Accounting

Regressions

Ordinary least square regressions of the cross-section of 49 countries around the world. The dependent variables are: (1)
efficiency of the judiciary system; (2) rule of law; (3) corruption; (4) risk of expropriation; (5) repudiation of contracts by
government; and (6) accounting standards in each country. The independent variables for the first regression in each panel
are the log of GNP per capita and the set of “legal origin” dummies (French, German, Scandinavian and the omitted dummy
being English). The second regression in the panel of each dependent variable includes the log of GNP per capita and a
dummy variable “Civil Law” which takes a value equal to 1 when the country belongs to the civil law tradition (i.e. all French,
German and Scandinavian Codes), and Owhen the country belongs to the “Common Law” tradition (i.e. English Common
Law). White (1980) standard errors are given in parentheses.

given in a given country. A firm
percentage of common skes owned by the three largest shareholders in the ten largmt privately -owneddomestic fm
is considered privately owned if the state is not a known shareholder in it, The independent variables are (1) log of GNP per capita; (2) log of GNP;
(3) Girti Coefficient; (4) the rule of law in the country which refers to an index of law and order tradition in the country; (5) the index for acmunting
standards in the country; (6) French legal origin; (~ German legal origin; (8) Scandimvian legal origin; (9) the antidirectors shareholders’ rights index
(calculated as indicated in Table 1); (10) “one share-one vote” that equals one if the Company Law or Commercial Code of the country requires that
ordinary shares carry one vote per share, and O otherwise; (11) mandatory dividend which equals the percentage of net inmme that the Company Law
