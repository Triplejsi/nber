UNITED STATES STEEL’S ACQUIS~ION
OF THE GREAT NORTHERN ORE
PROPERTIES : VERTICAL FORECLOSURE
OR EFFICIENT CONTRACTUAL

ABSTRACT

This paper examines United States Steel’s acquisition by long-term lease of the iron ore
properties of the Great Northern Railway. This 1906 transaction, which significantly increased U.S.
Steel’s already substantial ore holdings, has been characterized
