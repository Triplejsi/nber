EXCLUSIVE DEALING

models, we characterize the outcome of a contracting game in which manufacturers

1. Introductkn
A manufacturer engages in exclusive dealing when it prohibits a retailer or distributor who
carries its product from selling certain other products (often, although not always, those of its direct

competitors). For example, in one well-known antitrust case, Standard Fashion Co. v. Ma~raneHouston Co. (1922), a leading manufacturer
Boston retailer (Magrane-Houston)

of dress patterns (Standard) contracted

with a leading

and that it

on the Magrane-Houston

case, Bork [1978] puts the argument this way:

“Standard can extract in the prices that it charges all that its line is worth.

It cannot charge
the retailer that full amount in money and then charge it again in exclusivity that tie retailer
does not wish to grant. To suppose that it can is to commit the error of double counting.
. . .Exclusivity has necessarily been purchased from it, which means that the store has balanced
the inducement offered by Standard . . . against the disadvantage of handling only Standard’s
patterns . . . If consumers would prefer more pattern lines at higher prices, the store would not
accept Standard’s offer. The store’s decision, made entirely in its own interest, necessarily
reflects the balance of competing considerations that determine consumer welfare. Put the
matter another way. If no manufacturer used exclusive dealing contracts, and if a local retail
monopolist decided unilaterally to carry only Standard’s patterns because the loss in product
variety was more than made up in the cost saving, we would recognize that decision was in the

If Standard
finds it worthwhile to purchase exclusivity..., the reason is not the barring of entry, but some
more sensible goal, such as obtaining the special selling effort of the outlet. ” [pp. 306-7]

Formally, there are two possible ways to proceed. First, one can impose sufficient technical restrictions on payoffs and contracts

of thumb (e. g., he could do nothing, or could “satistice, - choosing randomly from among those contracts whose payoffs cannot
be exceeded by more than some amount t). The tirst approach rules out problematic subgames, while the second renders them
irrelevant. Both approaches lead to the same results.

‘As shown in a previous version of this paper (Bemheim and Winston,
1992), our analysis is essentially unchanged when
one permits manufacturers to condition payments on each others’ sales. The central difference is that, under this alternative
assumption, manufacturers can always write nominally non-exclusive contracts that are equivalent to exclusive contracts (e.g.
by permitting the retailer to serve olher manufacturers, while penalizing the retailer heavily whenever the sales of another
manufacturer are positive). Thus, the alternative assumption obscures the formal distinction between exclusive and non-exclusive
contracts without adding to the substantive content of the problem.

There are also some differences in the timing of decisions. In MaLhewson and Winter, bolh firms first decide whether to

However, if we were to change the timing of contract offers in our model while retaining
flexibility in the form of the contracts, the basic conclusions of our analysis would be unaltered.
‘For example, consider the case where demand for the products is almost completely independent. If a monopolist can only
offer simple per unit prices to consumers, then it has too little incentive to carry each product individually. In contrast, if the
monopolist can bundle multiple products, introducing a second product may increase profits by more than the consumer surplus
it generates (this would certainly be true if by bundling it could fully extract consumer surplus). S= Tirole [1988, pp. 104-5].

1, manufacturer

A, and manufacturer

B exceed the

joint profits received by these parties when B makes strictly positive sales in market 1.

l~he inefficiency of [he equilibrium outcome raises the possibility that renegotiation would alter our central results. Imagine,
for example, that all retailers and manufacturers can jointly renegotiate phase 1 contracts at the beginning of phase 3, and that
after retailer 1 and manufacturer A have entered into an exclusive relation in phase 1, B has nevertheless invested in phase 2.
Retailer 1 and manufacturer A should be willing to renegotiate their contract to permit sales by B. However, B will typically
share the surplus gained through renegotiation with these parties. If B’s share is sufficiently small, even the anticipation of
renegotiation will fail to justify investment by manufacturer B once A has consummated an exclusive contract with retailer 1.
Thus, as long as B’s bargaining power is not too great, exclusive dealing emerges exactly as in proposition 4.2.

Since exclusion does not occur with independent demand, one might well expect a

ban to be inconsequential. Caution is warranted, however; recall that in section 4.C, a ban on
exclusive dealing could alter equilibrium payoffs even if the retailer initially chose to represent both
manufacturers.

In the current instance, the effect of a ban is even more surprising:
