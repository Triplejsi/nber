THE EFFECTS OF THE CORPORATE
AVERAGE FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the effects of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards (CAFE)
on the automobile product mix, prices, and fuel consumption.

To this end, first a discrete choice

demand and a continuous model of vehicle utilization are estimated using

micro data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey for 1984-1990,

Next, the demand side model

is combined with a model of oligopoly and product differentiation

on the supply side. After the

demand and supply parameters are estimated, the effects of the CAFE regulation are assessed
through simulations,

and compared to the effects of alternative policy instruments,

such as a

powerful gas guzzler tax and an increase in the gasoline tax. Our results can be summarized

as

however, respond to both car prices and fuel cost.

These results taken together imply that (1)

16This is due to the fact that Chrysler took preemptive steps in the 1980s to avoid being CAFE constrained by
shifting its production mix towards small cars. In contrast, GM and Ford concentrated their efforts in lobbying
against the CAFE regulation.
17The utilization equation focuses on new cars alone; information on the mileage of used cars is available in
the CES, the information on used car characteristics, is, however, not detailed enough to allow estimation of
the utilization equation inclusive of used cars. For example, the CES does not report the exact production year
for used cars, so that the fuel efficiency of the used car models is unknown.
ISASmentioned above, in the discrete choice framework, demand for a particular vehicle type at the individual
level corresponds to an indicator variable, which is 1 when this vehicle type is purchased and O otherwise. The
expected value of this indicator variable is the probability of choosing that alternative.

21A priori, it seems unlikely that auto manufacturers would establish plants in foreign countries only to avoid
CAFE penalties; the anecdotal evidence suggests that other considerations, such as exchange rate movements, or
restrictive trade policies had a larger impact on foreign direct investment (FDI). Our approach does not attempt
to model FDI; instead, the existence of foreign plants is taken as given when manufacturers consider shifts in
the domestic content of their vehicles. In this sense, it is not unreasonable to presume that environmental
regulation has a considerable impact on domestic content decisions.
ZzThe implications of these definitions can be best illustrated in the csse of the Nissan Sentra. This model
is assembled in the U.S, and therefore excluded from the VER related calculations; nevertheless, the product
is - with exactly 74% domestic content – treated as an import by the EPA. Similarly, the Honda Accord and
Toyota Camry are produced both abroad and in the U.S., but the combined fleet is in both cases t rested as

25The latter drop out from the first order conditions of the profit maximizing firms; therefore it is not necessary
to further specify their functional form.
26The above profit m~imization expression refers to a domestic firm. Similar conditions apply to foreign
firms. All monetary variables are expressed in U.S. dollars, so that exchange rates do not enter the specification.
This formulation of the profit maximization condition ignores the presence of the VER on Japanese autos. As
I discuss in the data section, however, the empirical analysis concentrates on the 1985-1990 period. Anecdotal
and empirical evidence suggest that the VER had much weaker - if any - effects after 1985; consistent with
this evidence is also the fact that the Japanese, without any particular pressure from the American government,

AITable3 reports results from the most parsimonious specification. Various other specifications w= experimented with, some of which included a larger set of vehicle attributes, such as vehicle price, size, horsepower,
etc. None of the estimated coefficients for these attributes was, however, statistically significant, while the
OLS parameter estimate for fuel cost was slightly lower, implying a mileage elasticity of ca. 1670. Estimating
these alternative specifications with instrumental variables or the reduced form method produces exactly the
same pattern as in Table 3, namely the fuel cost coefficient becomes much smaller in absolute value, and both
the fuel cost and vehicle choice dummies become insignificant. The results were also robust to an alternative
specification, in which both regional and vehicle specific dummies were dropped from the estimation. These
dummies belong to the utilization equation, by virtue of Roy’s identity. Nevertheless, one might be concerned
that they absorb all of the variation in FUELC, given that the latter is computed as the product of regional
gasoline prices and MPG figures. However, without the dummies, the instrumental variables estimate of the
fuel cost parameter remains essentially unchanged (24.9, with standard error 197.4).

~’41tis important to note that the mileage demand eluticity here refers to a single vehicle in the stock (~i
denotes miles driven on car i); the elasticity for the utilization of the total stock, however, should be substantially
smaller. The reason multi-vehicle households are expected to be more price elastic than one-vehicle households
with respect to any single car, is that they can substitute towards more fuel efficient cars within their existing
stock rather than reducing their total driving; but this implies that their total mileage should be relatively
unresponsive to fuel cost changes.
45The variable FUELCM is the product of fuel cost and a dummy variable which is equal to 1 for multi-vehicle
households. FUELC1 is similarly defined for one-vehicle households. The variables FUINCL and FUINCH
represent interactions of fuel cost with dummy variables corresponding to households with annual income below
$30000 and above $30000, respectively. The numbers in parentheses are T-statistics.

qGAggregate time series data on the average annual miles traveled per vehicle between 1960 and 1990 seem
to support this interpretation; according to the AAMA Motor Vehicles Facts and Figures (various issues),
the average mileage was 9,446 in 1960 and 10,272 in 1970. Between 1970 and 1975, the period that included
the first oil price shock, the average mileage declined to 9,690. Between 1975 and 1980 fuel costs increased
significantly because of the second energy shock, and average mileage declined further to 9,141. After 1980, fuel
costs remained relatively stable and so did the average annual mileage. The latter increased by ca. 150 miles
per year between 1980 and 1990 to reach 10,548 miles in 1990. It is interesting to note that the modest fuel
price decreases in 1985 and 1986 were not matched by an incre=e in mileage; mileage incre~ed by only 2 miles
between 1984 and 1985, and 65 miles between 1985 and 1986, despite a decrease in the per mile cost of 1.68
cents in this time interval. The per mile cost slightly increased in the 1986-1990 period, but annual mileage
kept rising by ca. 200 miles per year. Of course, cross year comparisons do not control for other factors that
may influence mileage demand, such as changes in demographics, so that the conclusions that can be drawn
from them are only suggestive.

because the empirical evidence suggests that the VER might still have been effective during that year.

53The year 1985 was the first year in which CAFE was in effect; Both GM and Ford were well below the
prescribed standard of 27.5 MPG, and lobbied therefore intensely to reduce the standard to 26.0 MPG. The
1988/1989 period was marked by proposals to make environmental standards stricter, by raising, among other
things, the CAFE standard to 50 MpG by 2000.

SAAdirect comparison of the figures in Table 6 to published data is hampered by the fact that the latter are
typically broken down by corporation, while our predicted fuel efficiencies refer to domestic firm averages. To
get a rough idea about the accuracy of the model, the following back-of-the-envelope calculation was conducted:
The officially reported fuel efficiency of each corporation was multiplied by the share of that corporation in
the domestic car sales to construct a national average. For 1985, the relevant figures are 25.1 MPG and 64~o
market share for GM, 25.9 MPG and 22% market share for Ford, and 27.1 MPG and 14% share for Chrysler,
which average to 25.5 MPG. This figure is slightly above the 24.9 MPG implied by our model. Note, however,
that the above calculation did not distinguish between domestically produced, and imported cars. Confining
the computation to domestically produced cars alone, would bring the computed average further down. In
later years, the predicted average fuel efficiencies in Table 6 generally lie below the averages reported in the
Automotive News Market Data Book, but display similar trends in terms of the differences between domestic
and foreign firms.

case, for the simulation exercise, the choice of the particular year is of secondary importance (u long as the
sample for this year is fairly representative of the U.S. population), given that - by definition – simulations do not

and Further Research

Environmental policies aimed at reducing automobile fuel consumption have two aspects:
a “utilization” aspect that concerns the miles driven on the current car fleet, and a ‘~compositional” aspect that is related to the relative sales volume of vehicle types with different fuel
efficiencies. The goal of this paper was to provide an evaluation

65The view that the gasoline tax is regressive has recently been challenged by Poterba (1991). Poterba relates
gasoline expenditures to household expenditure rather than income, arguing that the former is a better proxy
for permanent income, and finds that outlays for gasoline are roughly proportional to household spending.
