direction of government-mediated

Because the level and

transfers reflect in part the relative political powers

of different cohorts, those in small cohorts may receive smaller net transfers than
those in larger cohorts.

Preston [1 984] suggests that such generational competition

is part of the explanation

for the relative improvement

in the economic status of

elderly households in the U. S., and the decline in the well-being of children, during the
1960-1980

period.

This hypothesis is confirmed by at least anecdotal evidence on

public support for various government programs.

Recent survey results suggest that

support for increased federal funding of public schools declines from 77 percent if the
respondent is under 30, to 47 percent for those over age 70 [Business Week, 3 April
1995,

p. 42].
The theoretical relationship between demographic structure and the age-specific

pattern of government spending is complex, in part because the age-specific benefits

If individuals are

altruistically linked to their parents and their children, then spending that raises the
utility of the old will also raise the utility of the young, and vice versa.3 Even without
such altruistic links, there may be cross-cohort direct utility effects associated with
government spending,

Spending on public education, for example, may reduce the

incidence of crime and thereby raise utility of the old, while also raising the utility of
the school-age children who receive this education, as well as their parents who are
not required to arrange for private education,4

Such cross-effects

set of empirical problems, since the demographic

composition of a small

community cannot be viewed as exogenous, but rather depends on the structure of
local public spending.

This can make it impossible to generalize from the local-level

relationship between demographic structure and spending patterns to broader-based
changes.
There have been many previous empirical studies of the determinants

of state

survey much of this work, and present new

empirical evidence relating state- and county-level per capita spending to the fraction
of the population above age 65, below age 18, and the fraction of the county that is
nonwhite.

Their analysis combines all types of state and local government spending,

including outlays on public hospitals, nursing homes, and on primary and secondary
education.

Separating these spending categories and focusing on particular types of

spending, such as K-12 education

spending, offers a more powerful

method for

testing hypotheses about demographic mix and spending levels, and motivates the
analysis below.
Rubinfeld and Shapiro [1989]

survey the substantial related literature on the

demand for state and local spending on elementary education.

The particular issue

of interest in the current context is how demographic factors affect the demand for
school spending, and this question has been considered in several previous studies.

recent studies by Case, Hines, and Rosen [1 993] and Poterba [1995b],

‘Gross [19951 presents in ingenious analysis of the role of demographic variables
in accounting for variation in local public spending. He finds relatively weak evidence
that households with similar demographic characteristics exhibit similar preferences,
but one of the cases for which his evidence is strongest is the homogeneity of
households with school-age children.
7The dependent variable is total government spending on K-12 education divided
by the state population aged 5-17. Using population rather than enrollment as the
divisor avoids the potential endogeneity problems associated with decisions to use
private schools, but it also makes it difficult to interpret the dependent variable as a
per-pupil-expenditure measure for public schools.

Zeckhauser [1993] as testing whether racial mix affects support for public spending.
It’s interpretation is difficult, however, since it may also proxy for higher moments of
the income distribution, such as the fraction of households with low income levels or
the fraction living in large cities.

To allow for these possibilities, some equations

include the logarithm of the fraction of the state’s population living below the poverty
line (POVERTY) or in urban areas (URBAN). The URBAN variable has an independent
rationale for inclusion: it may capture potential differences

in the cost of delivering

school services as a function of the spatial distribution of population,

as well as

potential taste differences for public spending between urban and rural residents.

they spend less. This may simply reflect
a lack of support among elderly voters for public programs that do not benefit the
elderly, or it may reflect a higher cost of raising funds in states with more elderly
because of pre-existing demands that elderly populations place on public coffers.

17
These results are strengthened by comparing them with the “control equation”
findings in Table 4, where the estimates suggest that a larger elderly population in a
state leads to higher spending on non-education programs.

Thus it does not appear

that the fraction of elderly individuals in the population is simply capturing a tendency
for elderly voters to support lower levels of public spending in general.
The fraction of the population of school-age also has a strong effect on perchild spending.

reduction in per-child spending.

These striking results should be viewed with caution for several reasons. First,
the “control equations” in Table 4 suggest that a higher population share of school
age reduces non-school spending per capita, with an elasticity of approximately

-.30.

The results in Table 3 suggest that per caD i@ school spending is independent of the
fraction of school-aged children in the population.

This implies that an increase in the

school-aged population reduces state and local government spending per capita, but
raises the share of such spending that flows to education.

changes in the size of the school-age population from the analysis.

If the enrollment

in a single state rises, competitive tax pressures and other factors may lead to smaller
spending increases than when the school-aged

population in the entire economy

increases.
Finally, the results suggesting a strong negative effect of student cohort size
on spending per pupil are consistent with a number of previous studies of spending
on public schools. Case, Hines, and Rosen [1993] find significant negative effects of
the school-aged

proportion of the population on per-child school spending,

though several earlier studies, including Denzau [1975],
[1 984],

found small effects.

Borge and Rattso [1 995]

Ladd [1 975],

even

and Megdal

find slow adjustment

to

demographic shocks in the composition of spending in Norway, along with a negative
correlation between group size and per-person spending.

Further analysis of the link

between cohort size and per-pupil spending, perhaps using changes in enrollment that
result from exogenous shocks such as changes in school district boundaries, seems
warranted .12

12Equations not reported here also explored how other demographic variables, such
as the number of children per household or the fraction of households with children,
are related to the level of education spending.
These variables did not have
statistically significant effects on school spending per child after the current variables
(school-age share and elderly share) were included in the regressions.

Interpretation

of the effect of fluctuations

in the school-age

population is more difficult, because economies of scale in education could make it
possible to deliver the same education to a larger cohort with less than a proportionate
expansion in educational spending. This is an issue that requires further exploration,
The estimated effects of the other independent variables in Tables 3 and 4 can
be described briefly. The relationship between per capita income and per child school
spending is weak but positive, and is highly affected by the inclusion of state and time
fixed effects as well as the fraction of the state population living below the poverty
line. Without POVERTY in the specification, the estimated income elasticity of school
spending is approximately

.50; without this variable, the income elasticity is on the

order of. 75. Federal grants to the state have a statistically significant positive effect

The OWNERS variable may also capture differences in the taste for public

The URBAN variable has a significant effect

on spending as well, with a one percent increase in the state population in urban areas
reducing per-child spending by about 0.4 percent.

across age groups can also have a negative effect on such spending. This subsection
explores two aspects of this interaction: whether these effects are stronger in states
with a high degree of population mobility, and whether these effects are attenuated
by property tax circuit-breaker

rules that limit property tax burdens, particularly for

older residents.
To address the impact of population mobility, a variable from the decennial
census indicating the fraction of the state population that resided in the state five
years ago is added to the basic specification.

This variable is also interacted with the

logarithm of the elderly share of the population, and the difference in the racial mix
between the 65+

and school-age population.

The resulting equation estimates are

shown in the first two columns of Table 7. The estimates in the first column suggest
that states with low population turnover (high values of Percent in State Five Years
Ago) spend more per child on public schools, although the estimated effects are not
statistically significantly different from zero.
There is also evidence of an intriguing, but imprecise, interaction effect with the
percent elderly in the population.

In a state in which all of the residents had been

there five years ago, the percent elderly variable would have essentially no effect on
school spending.

In a state with only half of the population resident for five or more

years, the estimated elasticity of school spending with respect to the elderly share
would be -.50.15

the state’s population consists of primarily long-term residents.

However, the effects

in this case are estimated with too little precision for further discussion.
The last two columns of Table 7 report estimates of equations that include an
indicator variable for whether

or not the state has a property tax circuit-breaker

Once again, however, the estimated effects are not significant at conventional levels

The link between property tax circuit breakers and demographic tension is an
issue that warrants further study. Better information on the nature of circuit-breakers,

implications of such changes for income inequality and economic growth depend on
controversial parameters linking school spending to school outcomes and wages, but
the potential effects could be substantial.

Tying education spending to

programs that benefit other community residents, for example building a school that

The prospective

analysis.

If a particular

demographic group such as the elderly place substantial demands on the public sector,
and this raises non-education

government spending, then the shadow cost of funds

for education will rise, and this spending program is likely to contract.

Second, it is

possible that elderly voters do not assign high priority to spending for education,

In

this case, jurisdictions where elderly voters are more important will spend less on
education as a result of the different tastes of their voting population.
