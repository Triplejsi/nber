MONEY AND EXCHANGE RATES IN
THE GROSSMAN-WEISS-ROTEMBERG
MODEL

ABSTRACT

We examine the impact of monetary injections in the Grossman-Weiss-Rotemberg

Model.

We show that monetary shocks can lead to nominal exchange rates that are much more volatile than
inflation, money growth, or interest rate differentials. Moreover, movements in real exchange rates
following

monetary injections can be persistent and nearly as large as movements in nominal

exchange rates.

1. Introduction
Few puzzles in international

economics

are as perplexing

as the behavior of exchange rates. Since the breakdown of
the Bretton Woods system of managed exchange rates in
the early 1970’s, there have been large and persistent movements in the nominal exchange rates between the currencies
of the United States, Japan, and the countries of Western
Europe.

These movements

in nominal exchange rates have

been much larger than the inflation, money growth, or interest rate differentials

across these countries.

at all but very low frequencies,

Moreover,

these movements

in nom-

rates are associated with movements

in real

exchange rates of roughly the same size and persistence.
In this paper, we consider whether a model of the impact of monetary injections on asset prices first proposed by
Grossman

and Weiss (1983)

Agents’

(1982)

visits to the asset market are

staggered, so, at any point in time, only a fraction of agents
are in the asset market.

When interest rates are positive,

agents choose not to trade currency for other assets between
visits to the asset market since they cannot begin to spend
the currency until they return to the asset market to fetch
it, Thus, in this model, when the government trades bonds
and currency in an open market operation at a point in time,
it does so with only the fraction of agents currently visiting

this model can produce as this parameter is varied. This exercise is thus similar to that in Lucas (1990), who concludes:
“There is a wealth of interesting data on flow
of funds, turnover rates of various kinds of accounts, and so on that monetary theory ought
to deal with but generally has not. To do so,
we will need to get further away from complete
markets in our theory, just as labor economists
have had to in their attempts to account for their
interesting turnover series. If the theory of the
transactions demand for money is to move in this
direction,

it is clear that we will need formula-

tions that place a smaller burden on the idea
of idea of a fixed period than do the models in
this paper. I have in mind not so much explaining the crucial time lags in the monetary system
(though that would be nice, too) but just describing them with free parameters that can be
more easily varied to fit data than the period
length in the usual discrete time formulations.”
Whether

or not the frictions required in this model

to

match exchange rate data are consistent with micro data on
trading patterns is a question we leave for future research.

2. The Behavior

of Exchange

Rates

The behavior of exchange rates since the end of the Bretton
Woods

era has been discussed extensively

in the literature.

See, for example, Meese and Rogoff (1983), Mussa (1986),
Baxter and Stoclunan (1989), and Flood and Rose (1995).
These,

and other,

articles document

4

several salient facts.

First, since the early 1970’s the exchange rates for the industrial countries have been very volatile, particularly in
comparison

to the volatility of other variables such as infla-

tion, money growth rates, or interest rates. Second, changes
in nominal and real exchange rates are highly correlated and
have roughly the same volatility. Third, movements in nominal and real exchange rates are highly persistent.
In tables 1 and 2 we present some statistics illustrating
these features of the data on exchange rates for the currencies of the G-7 countries versus the US dollar. Each statistic
reported in these tables is the mean of the corresponding
statistic across the G-7 computed from monthly data covering the period Jan 1973-Dec

1994. In table 1, we see that

the standard deviation of changes in monthly nominal exchange rates is large, particularly when compared with the

Moreover,

or interest
we see that

changes in nominal and real exchange rates are highly correlated and have roughly the same standard deviation. In
table 2, we see that both nominal and real exchange rates
are highly persistent.

The auto correlations

decay smoothly and, for real exchange rates, are consistent
with a half-life of roughly three years,

S denote the exogenous aggregate state realized at t and
s’ = (s0,..., st) denote the history of the state at t. Let

n (St) denote the unconditional probability of history St and
7T(s~+~;St) denote the probability of history St+k conditional
on history St.
There are two countries.

We call the first domestic and

the second foreign. Agents in this economy are organized
in families each of which is composed of one parent and a
continuum

of children of measure 1/(1 – ~). All of the do-

mestic families have the same preferences, endowments,
demographic
behavior

structure,

and

so we will consider the equilibrium

of a representative

domestic family.

Likewise, we

consider the equilibrium behavior of a representative foreign
family.
There

are two goods:

a domestic

good

and a foreign

good. Neither of these goods are storable. The parent of the
domestic family receives stochastic endowment {y(st)}~o
of
the domestic good and the parent of the foreign family receives endowment

{y* (St) }~o

of the foreign good,

We as-

sume that members of a family cannot consume their own
endowment.

Instead,

they sell their endowment

for cur-

rency and use currency to purchase goods from other families. There are two currencies used to purchase goods: the
domestic currency and the foreign currency. The domestic
currency is used to purchase domestic goods and the foreign
currency is used to purchase foreign goods.

The supplies of

the domestic and foreign currencies are denoted {M(s’)}:o
and {M* (St) }~4 respectively.

The domestic government

in-

troduces new domestic currency by handing out lump sum
of currency to the parent of the dotransfers {T(St) }~o
mestic family. The foreign government

hands out transfers

{T”(St)}:o
to the parent of the foreign family.
There are two physically separate locations in which trade
takes place:

an asset market and a goods market,

At the

beginning of each period, currencies and nominal claims are

6

traded in the asset market. After asset trade, currencies and
goods are traded in the goods market. Parents and children
perform separate roles in these markets.
Children carry currency which they use to purchase goods
on extended trips to the goods market. These shopping trips
have stochastic length. Each period, at the end of goods
trading, each child either continues with his current shopping trip for at least one more period or returns home to
his parent in the asset market. The probability that a child
continues with his current shopping trip is ~, while the probability that he returns home to his parent in the asset market is (1 – ~). If a child returns home to his parent after
goods

trading at St, all his unspent currency

is destroyed.

We denote the total unspent home and foreign currency that
is destroyed in equilibrium at St by {d(st), d“ (st)}~o.
assumptions about the shopping technology

These

imply that each

family has measure 1 children returning home to the asset
market at the end of each period.

Those children that return

home to the asset market after goods trade at St-1 receive
a gift of currency from their parent in the asset market at
St and use that gift to finance a new shopping trip starting
with goods

trade at St, We denote the quantities

of cur-

rency that parents give to their children in the asset market
at St by {a~(st), a~(st)}~o.
Here the superscript * indicates
the foreign currency and the index i = d, j indicates the
amounts given to the children of the domestic

and foreign

families respectively.
Parents sell the family endowment in the goods market.
Goods prices are denoted {p(st), p“ (st)}~o , so the domestic parent earns revenue p(st)y(st)

and the foreign parent

earns revenue p“ (St)y” (St). The parents also receive lump
sum transfers

trade

{ai(st),

make to their children that return home to the asset market.
We interpret y(st)

as goods sold in stores in the home

country for the home currency, while y* (St) are goods sold in
stores in the foreign country for the foreign currency. Given
this interpretation, we consider the quantities p“ (st)c~(st)
and

p(st)cf

as expenditures

children respectively

cordingly, we identify

of these price levels to be the domestic and foreign inflation
rates respectively.

Proposition

1: In equilibria in which nominal interest

rates are always positive, then parents’ currency holdings in
the asset market are given by

{~i(s’))~;(st)}:o
=o
Proof

Given assumption 1, bonds dominate cash in the

sense that it is cheaper for the parents to obtain currency
in the asset market at St+l by purchasing

bonds at St than

it is for them to hold the currency in the asset market from
St to St+1. The cost to the parent of holding

a unit of do-

mestic currency in the asset market at St is Q(st), while the
benefit is ~,,+1 Q(st, st+l). Assumption

1 implies that the

cost exceeds the benefit for all s’. Likewise for the foreign
currency. W
This proposition

implies that when interest rates are pos-

itive, asset prices adjust to induce the parents to give all the
new currency injected into the economy

at st to those chil-

dren who happen to be home with their parent in the asset
13

market at that time. Since these children cannot trade with
the other children in the goods market, these currency
jections

have a disproportionate

in-

impact on their currency

holdings and consumption.

2: Let the domestic children have period
u~(c, c*) = Olog(c) + (1 – O)log(c*)

and let

the foreign children have period utility function Uf(c, c* ) =

Choices for the value of the param-

eter O > 1/2 reflect the preference of children for their own
country’s

good.

To calculate how currency is divided between domestic and

conditions of the parents’ problem.

In partictiar,

the terms Z(st)

and z* (St) in these expressions are proportional

to the shares

of the total domestic and foreign currency supplies given to
domestic children in the asset market at St. Since every child
spends a constant fraction of his currency holdings each period, these terms Z(st) and Z“(st) are also proportional

Here, Z(st)

Currency and consumption

are dis-

tributed across children every period in proportion to the
wealth of their parents at date O, and all children within
a family have identical currency holdings and consumption.
In this sense, our model nests the standard const ant-velocity
cash in advance model when ~ = O.
Consider now the case in which y >0.
injections

Here, monetary

at St have an amplified impact on the currency

holdings of those children in the asset market at St and thus
an amplified impact on their consumption
is captured

at St. This impact

in the terms Z(.st) and z* (St). The magnitude

of the impact of changes in the money growth rate on the
distribution of currency holdings and consumption across
children changes with the parameter ~ in the natural way.
In particular,

the elasticity of Z(st) with respect to p(st) is

given by

Thus, the larger is ~, the larger is this elasticity.

18

Given the

demographics

of the model, the fraction

of children in the

asset market at any point in time is (1 —~). When ~ is larger,
shopping

trips are longer,

fewer children

are in the asset

market, and monetary injections must be absorbed by this
smaller number of children. As a result, monetary injections
of a given size have a larger impact on the currency holdings
and consumption

of those children,

Note that, holding

fied

~, the elasticity of z with re-

spect to p is declining in p. Thus, at higher average money
growth and inflation rates, the share of currency

and con-

sumption going to children in the asset market becomes less
sensitive to a one percentage

point change in money growth

and inflation rates because

these children are, on average,

receiving

a larger share of the total money stock.

As we

shall see below, this result also implies that asset prices and
exchange rates are also less sensitive to changes in money
growth and inflation rates when average inflation is high.
Observe that the only stochastic

elements in the terms

Z(st) and z* (St) are the current money growth rates p(st)
and p“(st).
This implies that monetary policy will have
a persistent effect on the distribution of currency holdings
and consumption

across children if money growth rates are

persistent and a transitory effect if money growth rates are
transitory,

The parameter ~ determining the len@h of shop-

ping trips has no bearing on the question of whether or not
monetary policy will have a persistent effect on the distribution of currency holdings and consumption

across children.

Instead, as we saw above, the parameter ~ only determines
the magnitude

of the impact of the current monetary

jection on the shares of currency and consumption
children currently in the asset market.

so the price of a

monetary injections depress real asset prices and their effect

asset prices can be used to price any nominal

or real se-

curity. In the next proposition, we use these asset prices

rates.

and current money

Thus, transitory movements in the money

in the real exchange rate while persistent move-

ments in the money growth differential across countries will
induce persistent movements in the real exchange rate. Changes
in the real and nominal

exchange

rate will be correlated,

since both depend on the differential of the money growth
rates across countries.

22

Monetary policy has two effects on interest rates in this
model as well. First, in this model, as in a quantity-theory
model, events at date t which signal higher money growth
between dates t and t + 1 raise expectations

of inflation and

nominal interest rates. Second, in this model, unlike a quantity theory model, differences in money growth rates at dates
t and t+ 1 also affect the real interest rate. Again, since children in the asset market receive a disproportionate
monetary

injections,

share of

changes in money growth rates from t

to ~+1 redistribute consumption

between those children who

are in the asset market at t and those in the asset market at
t + 1. Since parents prefer to distribute consumption

evenly

across their children, these changes in money growth rates
induce changes in the equilibrium

prices at which parents

can transfer consumption from children in the asset market
at t and those in the asset market at t + 1.
Consider, for example, a case in which endowments
are constant and money growth rates satisfy

y(s’)

with O < p < 1 for all St+1. Here, the parameter p governs
the persistence of money growth from St to St+l. In this case,
we can compute
log(l +T(s’))

the real interest rate as

) -log(l
= log(l – _ ’72
pl-Pp(st)P

- ~)

- log(~)

and the nominal interest rate as
log(l + 2(s’)) = log(l +T(s’))

+ (1 – p) log(p) +plog(p(s’)).

The elasticity of the real interest rate with respect to the
money growth rate p(st) evaluated at p(st) = P is given by
dlog(l

+ r(st))

= (p_

~,

Q’y’

while the elasticity of the nominal interest rate with respect

evaluated

at p(st)

= ~ is

given by
dlog(l

+ i(s’))

dlog(p(s’))

= (P-1)

P!$72

+P.

When ~ > 0 and p < 1, an increase in the money growth
rate at St decreases the real interest rate. Clearly the magnitude of this effect depends on the parameter v because
it depends

again on the elasticity of the share z of output

consumed

by children in the asset market with respect to

money growth p. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect also
depends on the persistence of money growth.

If increases in

money growth p(st) are very persistent, so p is very close
to one, then these increases in the money growth rate have
only a small negative effect on the real interest rate because
these increases in money growth have only a small effect on
the relative shares of output consumed

by those children in

the asset market at t and those children in the asset market
at t + 1. On the other hand, if increases in money growth
p(st)

are transitory,

so p is small, then they have a large

negative impact on real interest rates because they result in
a large increase the consumption

of those children in the as-

set market at t relative to those children in the asset market
att+l.
Combining

these implications

of proposition

4, we see

that if we choose domestic and foreign money growth rates
that are persistent

and not highly correlated

across coun-

tries, then the model will produce nominal and real exchange
rates that are persistent and volatile relative to inflation and
money growth differentials and interest rates that are close
to their Fisherian fundamentals.

In the next section,

present a numerical example to illustrate these results,

We simulated the model for 10,000 observations

to generate

moments in Tables 3 and 4 analogous to those reported from
data in tables 1 and 2. The six parameters in this example
are chosen so that our model in large samples reproduces
six moments

similar to those observed

in the data for the

G-7. These moments are the standard deviation of changes
in monthly real exchange rates (37Y0 at an annual frequency
as reported in table 1), the half-life of real exchange rates
(here set at 36 months),

the mean of inflation

(6.5% at an

annual frequency),

the mean of interest rates (9.570 at an

annual frequency),

the standard deviation of monthly infla-

tion (6% at an annual frequency as reported in table 1), and
the standard deviation
an annual frequency

of inflation differentials

(also 6% at

as reported in table 1).

The mapping between these six parameters and these six
moments can be approximated as follows. From 5.6, we see
the variance of the first difference of the log of real exchange
rates is given by 4(1 — p6c)a~/(1 + p) and the persistence of
real exchange rates is determined
mean of the log of inflation

p, The

term log(~) + 210g(~) – log(l – z) and the mean of the
log of nominal interest rates for p close to one is approximately the mean of 2 log(~) — Iog(l — z). To a first order
approximation,

the variance of the log of inflation is given

by [2/(1 – Z)]2 a~/(1 – p2) and the variance of inflation differentials by 2(1 – p,,) [2/(1 – Z)]2 a~/(1 – p2).
In this numerical example, we have chosen a high value
for the persistence

p

of monetary policy. We chose this value

so that the model would generate persistent real exchange
rates. As a consequence of this choice, nominal interest rates
in this model are close to their Fisherian fundamentals.

we have also chosen

In this example,

the ratio of the variance

to the variance

ence of the log of real exchange

of the first differ-

rates is given by the term

(2/(1 - 2))2(1 + p)/(1 - p2). In data as reported in table
1, this ratio is 0.027. Thus, to match the relative variance
of inflation differentials and innovations to real exchange
rates given a the high value of

p

we

have chosen to match

the persistence of real exchange rates, we must choose z on
the order of 0.03.

The parameter

of currency and consumption

z is the average share

going to children in the asset

market. It is only when this average share is small that
small changes in money growth rates have large effects on

28

the portfolios of children in the asset market. Given average
inflation rates observed in the data, this share is small only
if the fraction of children in the asset market is small.

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we have characterized the impact of monetary
policy on inflation, asset prices, and exchange rates in the
Grossman-Weiss-Rotemberg
model.
We have shown that
this model can reproduce some salient features of exchange
rate behavior if its parameters are chosen so that only a very
small fraction

of agents participate

in open market opera-

tions at any point in time and if domestic and foreign money
growth rates are persistent and not highly correlated across
countries.

In particular, given these assumptions,

generates

nominal

exchange

the model

rates that are highly volatile

relative to inflation, money growth, or interest rate differentials, movements in real exchange rates that are highly
correlated with movements in nominal exchange rates and
also very volatile,

and movements

in nominal and real ex-

change rates that are highly persistent.
