DEREGULATION AND LABOR EARNINGS
IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY

ABSTRACT

This paper uses a variety of data sources to study the effect of deregulation on the structure
of wages in the airline industry. Microdata from the 1980 and 1990 Censuses show a 10 percent
decline in the relative earnings of airline workers after deregulation, with roughly similar declines
for industry-specific occupations (pilots and flight attendants) and general occupations (managers
and secretaries). Union contract data for pilots, flight attendants and mechanics at the major firms
show similar trends in the levels of earnings along with a rise in inter-firm wage inequality -especially for pilots. Finally, data from the displaced worker surveys reveal that airline workers
experienced similar wage losses to job-losers from other industries over the 1980s. Taken as a
whole, the evidence suggests that the rent premiums earned by airline workers in the regulatory era
were relatively modest, and comparable to the wage premiums earned in many other sectors.

The new entrants competed aggressively with the incumbent airlines,

offering lower fares, new routes, and low-cost “no frills” flights.

The advent of open

competition in the airline industry coincided with a rapid rise in energy prices and a prolonged
recession. In the newly deregulated marketplace this combination of supply and demand shocks
proved too much for many incumbents: by 1985 the output share of the 11 original ‘trunk”
airlines had declined substantially, and several firms were in bankruptcy. 2

Many start-up firms broke with industry tradition by hiring non-union flying

personnel and adopting flexible work rules. In a highly publicized move, Texas International (a
former “local service” airline) purchased Continental Airlines and then used bankruptcy
protwtion laws to abrogate Continental’s union contracts.

national or international flight schedules. These were known as “trunk” airlines. Another 13-15
firms were allowed to offer short-haul flights in specific regional markets -- these were known
as “local service” carriers.

attempted to lower their marginal costs by instituting lower pay scales for newly-hired
employees.

Unionized airline workers fought hard against these developments: the industry

experienced a series of bitter labor disputes throughout the 1980s.
The post-deregulatory wave of downward pressure on labor costs was anticipated by many
analysts, who had argued that the structure of airline regulation, coupled with the high rate of
union coverage in tie industry, led to super-competitive wages4.

IndA,

tabulations by

Helwege (1992, Table 1) show that airline employees were among the most highly-paid industry
groups in the 1960, 1970, and 1980 Censuses. To the extent that workers were able to capture
some of the rents generated by airline regulation, one might have ex~ted

deregulation to lower

equilibrium wages in the industry, especially for the highly unionized industry-specific
occupations.

Nevertheless, some of the downward pressure on wages in the early 1980s was

likely a transitory phenomenon caused by adverse business cycle conditions, high oil prices, and
short-run adjustments to the newly competitive environment.
After n~ly

two decades it is now possible to reach some firmer conclusions on the long-

run labor market effects of airline deregulation. 5 This paper uses a variety of data sources to
address two s~ific

questions: How has deregulation affected the ~

And how has deregulation affected the ~is~rsion of

With respect to the first question, I find that the relative

40ne of the earliest studies of union wage effects was conducted on airline pilots. Lewis
(1961, pp. 99-105) re-analyzed the data used in this study and concluded that airline pilot
earnings were 24-30 percent above “competitive” rates in the mid- 1950s.
‘There is an extensive literature on airline deregulation and earnings: see for example

McPherson (1994a).

of airline employees have declined modestly since 1978: on the order of 10 percent.

Perhaps surprisingly, the d~lines have been similar for most occupation groups. The relative
earnings of secretaries and managers in the airline industry fell by about the same percentage as
the relative earnings of pilots. Airline mechanics are a notable exception: their relative wages
have been roughly constant since the late 1970s. These patterns suggest that pre-1980 airline
wages mntained a modest regulatory rent component that was shared by employ~s in most
occupations.
With respect to the ~ond

question, the available data show a rise in the dispersion of

wages in the airline industry after 1980. Nevertheless, the increase in inquality

in the airline

wtor is comparable to the economy-wide rise in wage inequality over the past decade (s& e.g.
Levy and Mumane (1992)). Some of the inter-firm and intra-firm wage differentials that opened
up in the wly - 1980s have been eliminated with the bankruptcy or sale of “low-wage” entrants
and the elimination of two-tier wage schedules at the surviving incumbents. While a few lowwage firms still survive, the fraction of employment at such carriers remains small.
Finally, an interesting perspective on the effects of airline deregulation is obtained by
studying workers who lost jobs in the industry over the 1980s. Although the fraction of such
workers is small, the use of a pooled sample from the six Displaced Worker Surveys conducted
betwmn 1984 and 1994 yields an important conclusion.

On average, workers displaced from

the airline industry experienced very similar wage changes to workers displaced from other
industries.

Moraver,

workers who lost jobs in the airline industry and moved to new jobs in

other industries fared as well as those who found new jobs in the airline industry. These findings

reinform the conclusion that the effwts of deregulation on airline workers’ wages were relatively
modest.

J. R~ulation and Labor Earn in~s in the Airline Industn : A Review of Alternative HYN these$
There is no general theory of the relation betw~n product market regulation and labor
earnings. A widely-held view is that regulation creates potential rents which are then shifted in
part to employees, Trade unions may be instrumental in rent shifting and also may play a role
in the actual creation of rents by raising costs among regulated firms. s

Nevertheless, as

Hendricks (1975, 1977) has emphasized, the effect of regulation depends on the nature of the
product market and on the regulatory process. The predicted effect of a change from a regulated
to an unregulated environment also depends on the structure of the unregulated industry. In this
section I briefly describe the regulated and unregulated airline industries and summarize some
of the possible predictions for the effwt of deregulation on labor earnings.

Aeronautics Board (CAB), and entry into the industry was highly restricted.
allowed no new trunk ctiers

In fact, the CAB

to enter after 1938, and no new local service airlines to enter after

1951 (Keeler, 1981). In addition to setting prices the Board also controlled the route structure
of each airline.

The CAB permitted only a limited number of carriers to offer competing

services in each major market, and one or two firms to serve the smaller markets. As existing

5
markets expandd

or new ones developed, the CAB often follow a compensatory policy of

awarding more lucrative routes to w~er

or less profitable firms (Caves, 1962, pp. 192-231).

Despite the regulation of routes and fares, individual airlines were free to vary the number
of flights on their allottd routes. Industry analysts (e.g. Douglm and Miller (1974), DeVany
(1975)) argued that airlines with parallel routes competed by offering more frequent flights,
driving down marginal revenues per flight to the level of marginal cost. Perhaps the strongest
evidence for this h~thesis

took the form of low “load factors” in the regulated airline industry

relative to the unregulated intrastate market. 7 In the early 1970s the CAB attempted to bolster
industry profits by approving the formation of capacity-limiting agr~ments among the trunk
airlines, although such agreements were only reached in a few markets (Graham and Kaplan,
1982, p. 13). Airline firms also competed on other dimensions of service, including the use of
more modem aircraft and the provision of more comfortable seating. During the regulated era
the average return on investment in the airline industry was relatively low (Bailey, Graham, and
Kaplan, 1985, Table 1.2) suggesting that the overall degree of non-price competition was strong.
Although most obseners

believe that CAB regulatory policies created a favorable

environment for raising airline workers’ wages above competitive levels, the ~
is uncl~.

of the effect

On one hand, the fact that fares were based on a markup over industry average costs

suggests that airlines as a whole had limited incentives to resist wage increases.

On the other

hand, the extent of non-price competition and the fragmented collective bargaining structure of
the industry suggest that even under CAB regulation individual firms had strong incentives to

6
resist wage increases. *

The lack of industry-wide bargaining meant that wage incr=ses

negotiated by one firm would not automatically raise industry average costs and regulated fares.
Airlines’ bargaining power wm also bolstered by a strike insurance plan known as the Mutual
Aid Pact, Under this agreement an airline grounded by a labor dispute received some of the
extra revenues earned by its competitors during the strike (see Unterberger and Koziara, 1977
and Cremieux, 1995),9 On balance, airline workers may have kn

less successful at capturing

regulatory rents than their counterparts in other industries, such as over-the-road trucking.

b. Dere~ulatioq
Regulatory control of the tirline industry was eliminated gradually over the 1975-81
period. Minimum pricing policies were relaxed in 1976 and 1977 and dropped altogether in late
1978. The CAB’s authority over entry and route structures continued until 1981, although entry
was substantially free by 1980 (Moore, 1986). Potential entrants responded almost immediately
to the lifting of regulation: the number of certified airlines rose from 31 in 1977 to 93 in 1982,
and reached a peak of 106 firms in 1985.10
Even more important than deregulation’s effect on the number of airline firms was its
effect on the s~cture

of airline routes. In the early 1980s the airlines re-organized their routes

different unions, and historically bargained independently. See Kahn (1980) and Capelli and
Harris (1985).
%e payments were often large: for example, in 1966 American Airlines earned $48 million
in net income and paid $29 million in Mutual Aid benefits (American Airlines, 1967).

awarded by tie CAB. With the demise of the CAB, certification fell to the Department of
Transportation. A list certified airline firms is published annually in Air Trans~rt.

into “hub-and-spke”

networks. Such networks provide two key advantages. First, they raise

productivity by cr=ting a transfer station betw=n smaller cities and allowing firms to consolidate
long-distance travelers from many markets. 11 Second, hubs create a strategic advantage in the
highly competitive air travel market. By offering a wide range of flights at a hub, an airline

customer base that cannot be asily

The incr~ing

captured by a competitors’ fare

returns created by hubbing have led to a notable rise in the

conmntration of air travel business at many airports. The average fraction of passengers flying
with the dominant carrier at each of the nations’ 21 largest airports rose from 33 percent in 1977
to 51 percent in 1993.12
A second innovation in the post-deregulation era is ‘the expanded role of computer
reservation systems, These systems -- airline-owned networks of computer terminals on travel
agents’ desks -- channel customer demand to the firm that owns the network and simultaneously
gather market data nded

to manage sophisticated pricing strategies. It is argued that American

and United, which own the two dominant computer reservation systems, generate significant y
higher revenue per passenger as a result of their control of travel agents’ networks and through
their yield management strategies (=

Williams, 1994, chapter 2).

A comparison of the regulated and deregulated airline markets suggests that although the
elimination of CAB control over routes and pricing policies eliminated the primary sources of

1lHub-and-spoke systems also allow for more efficient use of airline crews, and for
consolidation of airline maintenance facilities.
12The 1977 figure is based on data in Williams (1994, Table 2.6). Comparable data for 1993
are taken from U.S. Department of Transpofi, 1994. The share of the dominant carrier rose at
16 airports and fell at 5. Interestingly, all 5 airports with a decline in the dominant firm’s share
are on the east or west mast.

8
rents in the airline industry, the emergence of hub-and-spoke route systems and the dominance
of a few computer reservation systems have created other rent sources.

Unlike the situation

under CAB regulation, rents in the unregulated market arise from firm-specific factors. Thus
employees at some firms may be able to maintain super-competitive wages in the unregulated
industry, while wages at other firms may be driven to competitive levels.

This reasoning

suggests that deregulation might be expected to lead to a dwline in ~verap~ wages of airline
workers and a simultanaus

rise in the inter-firm dispersion in wages.

JI. tie rview of tie Industrv
To set the stage for an analysis of earnings trends, Table 1 presents some data on output
and employment in the airline industry since deregulation.

The left-hand columns of the table

report two measures of output in the air travel sector: revenue passenger miles, and available seat
miles. The latter is a measure of physical output, while the former is a measure of sales. The
ratio of the two is the “load factor” or average fraction of filled seats, presented in column 3.
As shown by the growth rates at the bottom of the table, air travel has expanded rapidly
in the past 30 years, with a somewhat slower rate of growth since 1978.13 Over the past 15
yws revenue passenger miles grew faster than available seat-miles, reflecting a rise in average
load factors (from 53.8 permnt in 1960-77 to 60.7 percent in 1978-94). This upward shift is

131nfact 9 a simple prediction equation for revenue passenger miles that includes real GNP,
a linear trend, and a post-1978 trend reveals a significantly slower rate of growth in revenue
passenger miles after 1978 than in the 1960-77 period. The estimated model is:
log(RPM) = constant + 2,93* log(GNP) + 0.003 *trend - 0,018 *Post-1978 trend,
The R-squared coefficient is 0.995; the t-statistic for the post-1978 trend coefficient is 3.4.

9
consistent with the hypothesis that high fares led to excessive scheduling competition and low
load factors in the regulatd

industry. 14

Column 4 of Table 1 shows the fraction of industry sales (i.e. revenue passenger miles)
accounted for by the 11 original trunk airlines.

Over the regulato~ era this share was fairly

stable at just over 90 percent. In the first few year of deregulation the incumbent trunks’ market
share dipped sharply, r~ching a low of 77 percent in 1984.

Starting in 1985, a series of

acquisitions by the stronger incumbents led to a re-consolidation of the industry. These trends
are illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the market shares of the three largest incumbents
(American, Delta, and United); the other 8 original trunks (4 of which no longer survive); and
the smaller incumbents and new entrants. The market share of-the three leading survivors was
fairly stable until 1985. Thereafter, American’s acquisition of Air California, Delta’s acquisition
of Western, and all three firms’ rapid expansion into international markets led to steady rise in
their combined industry share. 15 By 1993, the three largest firms accounted for 56 percent of
total indus~

sales.

The next column of Table 1 reports average revenues per seat-mile earned by the industry
for combined domestic and international flights. Inflation-adjusted prices of passenger services
have declined s~dily

in the past 30 years, with a slightly faster rate of decline since 1978.

14Aspredicted by the “quality competition” hypothesis, deregulation also led to lower quality
via an increase in the number of seats per aircraft. For example, in the early 1980s, American
increased seating by 11-12 percent on most of its fleet (American Airlines, 1980). Delta
instituted similar changes in 1981-82 (Delta Airlines, 1982 and 1983).
150ther important mergers/acquisitions include Northwest’s purchase of Republic in 1986,
Transworld’s purchase of Ozark in 1986, USAir’s purchases of PSA and Peidmont, and the mid1980s merger of Texas International, New York Air, and Paples Express into Continental.

10
Price trends in the airline industry must be interpreted carefully, since twhnological changes have
not necessarily occurred evenly over the past thr~ decades. Moreover, changes in the relative
prices of industry inputs may have contributed to differences in the rate of growth of output
prices before and after deregulation. For example, real fuel costs rose sharply between 1968 and
1978, but fell between 1978 and 1994. ‘b Since fuel costs account for 10-20 percent of toti cost
in the industry, these trends would have been ex~ted
in rd

to generate a more rapid rate of dwline

seat-mile prices after 1978.
While most attention is usually devoted to the passenger travel component of the airline

industry, the certified air transport sector also -includes air cargo carriers. As shown in column
6 of Table 1, freight shipments (measured in ton-miles) have grown at a slightly slower pace than
pwsenger miles since 1978. A key factor in the post-deregulatory growth of air cargo was the
addition of Federal Express to the certified industry in 1986.17
Column 7 of Table 1 reports the rate of return on investment for airline firms as a whole.
Airline profits are highly cyclical: the industry earned low returns in the early 1980s and suffered
unprwedented losses during the 1990-92 rwession. Rates of return on investment in the airline
industry have b~n relatively low since deregulation, averaging just 3.9 percent per year from
1979 to 1994, versus 5.8 percent over the 1960 to 1978 pe.ricd.

Contrary to this realized

experience, the stock market’s reaction to the initial news of airline deregulation was mildly

slightly higher future profits in the industry as a result of deregulation -- a very different situation
than in trucking, for example, where news of deregulation had a negative effect on the value of
incumbent firms (Rose, 1985).
Finally, columns 8 and 9 present data on airline industry employment and productivity.
Industry employment was relatively stable in the decade before deregulation (growing at an
average rate of only 0,5 per~nt Wr year) but has risen at a faster pace sinu 1978. Part of this
faster growth is attributable to the addition of Federal Express to the industry in 1986. Even
excluding Federal Express, however, employment in the rest of the industry grew at 2.0 percent
per year between 1978 and 1994. The combination of faster employment growth and slower
output growth after 1978 accounts for the relatively large drop in “productivity” growth
(measured by growth in revenue passenger-miles per employ=) following deregulation. 18
While it may be tempting to conclude from this drop that deregulation lowered
productivity growth, such an inference ignores the role of technological change in the airline
industry.

For example, prior to 1978, increasing aircraft size and the replacement of first

generation jet aircraft led to significant productivity gains (W Kahn, 1980).19 Since 1978,
aircraft size and other crude measures of aircraft technology have changed at a slower pace. A
simple way to control for technological factors is to compare productivity growth in the U.S.
airline industry relative to other countries.

Between 1979 and 1994, passenger miles per

19First generation jet aircraft required thrm flight officers and relatively frequent

employee grew by about 50 percent in the U.S. industry as a whole, with increases at individual

By comparison, revenue passenger miles per employee grew by 16 percent at Air Canada, 66
percent at Air France, 90 percent at KLM, 95 percent at Lufthansa, 125 percent at Japan
Airlines, and 136 percent at British Airways.

These data suggest that the U.S. carriers had

comparable productivity growth to other major international firms over the past 15 years, and
that deregulation probably did not slow the relative growth of productivity .21

employment have continued to grow since deregulation.

First, airline industry output and
Employment growth has been

particularly strong, averaging 2 percent per year since 1978. Second, the airline industry is
extremely cyclical.

The 1982 and 1990 recessions both resulted in slow output growth and

employment cuts.

Third, while deregulation has led to a proliferation of airline firms, the

industry is still dominated by a few large carriers.

In fact, over 50 percent of industry output

is now produced by the three largest firms in the industry, and the 7 surviving incumbent trunk
airlines together account for over 85 percent of industry output. Moraver,

sales in individual

airline markets are now more highly concentrated than under regulation.

*“Data on employment and output of most major airlines in the world are available in annual
reports of the International Air T-ransport Association (IATA). One explanation for firm-specific
differences in productivity growth is average flight length, which expanded more rapidly for
United than for TWA or Northwest.

III. Chan~es in Eamin~s for Airline Workers

emiew
Table 2 presents an overview of earnings trends in the airline industry from 1975 to 1994.

The average weekly earnings data in this table are derived from three sources: firm-level average
earnings data (reported in the FAA Statistical Handbook of Aviation and ATA’s Air TransDort) ;
establishment-level data collected by the BLS Industry Wage Surveys; and individual wage data
collected by the Current Population Survey (CPS). For comparative purposes, the fourth column
of the table shows average weekly earnings for non-supemisory workers in the overall economy.
The earn” s data are reported in 1995 dollars, using the Consumer Price Index as a deflator.
T
The firm-based earnings series in column 1 suggests that average real wages in the airline
industry were relatively stable from 1975 to 1983, fell about 11 percent between 1983 and 1991,
and have been roughly constant since then. Industry Wage Survey (NS) data are only available
for 1975, 1980, and 1984, but confirm the relative stability of real wages betw~n
1984.22 Other firm-bad

1975 and

data series, such as the ones analyzed by Cremieux (1996) and Hirsch

and McPherson (1994a, Table 10), are consistent with these patterns, and show a 10-13 percent
d~line in average wages in the urtified airline industry between the mid- 1970s and the early
1990s.

**Thepublished IWS summties do not include wages for all occupations, and do not provide
an overall industry average wage. I used the reported wage and employment data by occupation
to construct a weighted average industry wage for each year.

14
The data in column 3 are taken from Hirsch and McPherson (1994a), and are derived
from individual micro data collected in the monthly Current Population Suney (CPS).Z

The

scope of the air transport industry in the CPS (and in the Census data files analyzed below) is
somewhat broader than the cetified

airlines included in the data in columns 1 and 2.

Specifically, the CPS and Census industry classification also includes lW
as well as airport Senice establishments.

air taxis and charters,

I estimate hat the certified industry accounted for

about 65 per~nt of all workers in the Census air transport industry in 1980 and about 70 percent
in 1990. This broader industry definition creates some slippage in drawing inferences about the
certified air transport sector from CPS or Census data.
Whether bause

of the broader industry definition or for other reasons, average weekly

earnings of airline workers maured
mings

in the CPS are 15-18 percent lower than average w~kly

measured from firm-level data. Nevertheless, the CPS-based wage data show a similar

pattern over time. In particular, the wage series in column 3 shows roughly constant real wages
until the early 1980s, followed by a modest (1O percent) decline.
Interestingly, the magnitude of the post-deregulation decline in real wages for airline
workers (from either firm or individual data sources) is very similar to the decline in economywide average wages from 1979 to 1994 registered by the wage series in column 4 of Table 2.
This earnings series, which is derived from payroll surveys, shows a 12 percent fall in average
wages of all non-supervisory workers in the U.S. labor market, versus the 12-14 percent decline
for airline workers in columns 1-2 and the 10 percent decline for airline workers in column 3.

‘The data are derived from questions asked about an individual’s weekly or hourly earnings
on his or her main job as of the CPS survey week. See Card (1989) for an extensive discussion
of alternative earnings measures in the CPS.

15
The similarity of earnings trends in the airline industry and the overall anomy

is

potentially surprising. It should be noted, however, that most other aggregate wage series show
a different trend tian the payroll-based series in column 4. Indeed, most series show roughly
constant aggregate real wages betw~n 1979 and the early 1990s, implying a decrea~ in airline
workers’ relative wages after deregulation. 24 It is also worth noting that the dramatic changes
in the structure of wages that occurred throughout the economy over the 1980s might have been
expected to lead to some change in airline relative wages even in the absence of deregulation,
since airline workers are more educated and more likely to be male than other workers. In order
to make a reliable assessment of relative earnings trends it is necessary to use a data set that
provides comparable earnings information for airline and non-airline workers, and also includes
data on education, age, gender, and other factors that affect the structure of wages.

b. Micro Data on Relative Earnin~~
Previous studies of the effect of deregulation on earnings in the airline industry have
relied on Current Population Survey data (e. g., Card, 1989, Hirsch and McPherson,

1994a).

A major limitation of the CPS is the relatively small number of airline workers in the sample.
Since the airline industry accounts for only 0.7 percent of all U.S. workers, a typical monthly
CPS sample includes only 350-400 airline workers. An alternative source of individual micro
data that provides far larger sample sizes is the decennial Census. In the Census, individuals are
asked their total annual earnings for the previous year, and their w~ks of work and usual weekly
hours. These responses can be combined to construct average weekly or hourly earnings over

the previous year. Although retros~tive

earnings and hours data are conceptually less attractive

than the point-in-time wage measures available from the monthly CPS files, a comparison by
Card and hmieux

(1996, Table 9) suggests that the trends in two data series have been quite

similar over the 1980s.
Table 3 presents some descriptive statistics on the samples of airline workers and nonairline workers available from the 5-percent public use files of the 1980 and 1990 Censuses. In
drawing these samples I included all employees in the airline industry with positive (nonallocated) earnings, and 5 percent of workers in all other industries (see the Data Appendix).
To measure any rwent @st- 1989) trends, I also constructed a pled

sample of workers from

the March 1994 and 1995 Current Population Surveys. (The March CPS includes retros~tive
earnings and hours questions very similar to those in the decennial censuses), Note that the two
March CPS samples together contain only 789 airline employees, compared with 20-30 thousand
airline workers in the Census files.
The demographic characteristics in rows 2-5 of Table 3 revd

that airline workers are

more highly-educated than those in other industries. The gap of about 0.5 years of schooling has
not changed appreciably since 1980. Airline workers are also disproportionately male and much
more likely to be veterans of the armed forces.

Again, the relative fractions of women and

veterans in the airline industry have not changed much since 1980. In contrast to the differences
in education, gender, and veteran status, the airline industry includes about the wme fraction of
nonwhites as the overall labor force.
Rows 6-11 of Table 3 present a variety of information on w~kly and hourly earnings in
1979, 1989, and 1993-94. As suggested by the data in Table 2, airline workers earn significantly

17
higher average wages than employees in most other industries. For example, in 1979 the

ratio

of mean weekly wages of airline workers to non-airline workers was 1.52, while the gap in mean
log hourly wages was 0.46. The relative distributions of airline and non-airline workers in 1979
and 1989 are illustrated in Figure 2. In 1979 the wage distribution of airline workers appears
to be boti shifted to the right and more compressed than the wage distribution of other workers.
In 1989, the differences between the two distributions appear smaller, although the airline wage
distribution is still shifted to the right. Despite these visual impressions, conventional measures
yield ambiguous conclusions about the relative inequality of wages in the airline industry, Using
the standard deviation of log hourly wages as a benchmark, airline wages were more dismr%
than non-airline wages in 1979; using the interquartile range as an index, airline wages were less
disperse.
The data in Table 3 yield somewhat different conclusions about the trend in aggregate rd
wages than the BLS payroll series reported in Table 2. In particular, real hourly wages in the
non-airline sector show only a small drop betw~n 1979 and 1989 in the Census data, compared
to the 10 percent decline in column 4 of Table 2. 25 Rd wage trends in both the airline and nonairline sectors are also somewhat sensitive to whether wages are masured by the hour or by the
w~k.

These differenws are explored in grater detail below.
Table 4 presents a series of estimated regression models that masure trends in the relative

wages of airline workers over the past two decades. These models regress the log of average
hourly earnings for an individud on an indicator for employment in the airline industry, or on

‘Aggregate wage trends in the decennial Census are therefore more in line with other data
sources, such as the March CPS and unemployment insurance tax records -- see BLS (1994).

a set of interactions of an airline industry dummy with dummies for specific mupation

groups.

The table presents models with no other control variables (in the odd-number columns) and
models with a standard

setof

individual-level control variables (in the even-numbered columns).

Examination of the estimated coefficients in Table 4 leads to three basic conclusions.
First, the addition of conventional “human capital” control variables lowers the estimated airline
wage differential by 10-14 percent, with a slightly larger adjustment in 1979 than in later years.
On average, differences in education, location, gender, and experience account for about onethird of the gross wage advantage of airline workers.

At the occupation level, the adjustment

is particularly large for pilots (who are mainly males, have high education, and tend to have
considerable experience) and is negligible for flight attendants.

Second, the estimated hourly

wage premium for working in the airline industry is relatively large for pilots and flight
attendants (40-70 percent), and more modest for aircraft mechanics and “non-specialized”
occupations (10-20 percent). As shown below, this is partl y an artifact of the low hours worked
by airline flight persomel.

Third, the time-series patterns of the raw and adjusted wage

differentials show about a 10-15 percent decline in the airline industry premium between 1979
and 1989, with little or no change from 1989 to 1993-94. For pilots and flight attendants the
relative declines are roughly similar using unadjusted or adjusted earnings. For mechanics and
for “non-specialized” occupations the declines in unadjusted wages are larger than the d~lines
in adjusted wages.

The discrepancy is especially notable for mechanics: mean log wages of

airline mechanics dalined 13 percent from 1979 to 1989, but their adj usted wages were virtually
constant.

19
Q. C han~es in WaPe Differentials Bv Occu~ation
In light of the findings in Table 4 it is interesting to look more carefully at the effects of
deregulation on different occupation groups. It is also important to chwk the robustness of any
conclusions to the use of an hourly versus a w~kly wage.

Although the hourly wage is an

appropriate mmure of pay for most occupation groups, a weekly wage is arguably better for
pilots and flight attendants. Ffi

regulations restrict pilots to a maximum of 85 flying hours per

month, and many union contracts limit pilot hours even further. Similarly, most flight attendant
contracts specify overtime pay for hours in excess of 65 per month. Given these institutional
features, weekly earnings may be a better measure of the relative return to full-time employment
in the airline indus~.
Table 5 presents estimated airline industry differentials in hourly and weekly wages for
specific mcupation groups in 1979, along with the changes in the corresponding differentials
from 1979 to 1989.26 The differentials are derived from regression models that include the same
covariates used in the even-numbered columns of Table 4. The results in row 1 compare the
evolution of the airline industry wage differential in hourly and wmkly earnings. In 1979, the
airline wage premium was slightly larger for hourly than w~kly wages, while the reverse was
true in 1989. Thus the decline in the hourly wage premium is larger than the decline in the
weekly wage premium. Examination of the results in rows 2 and 3 reveals that the discrepancy
betw~n hourly and weekly earnings is relatively large for pilots and flight attendants. For other

2bFor simplicity I have not presented any information on wage developments in the early
1990s. As suggested by the patterns in Table 4, changes in airline industry wage premiums from
1989 to 1993/94 are generally small and unsystematic.

20
occupations there is little difference in the airline differential for weekly or hourly earnings, and
to save spare I present only the hourly results for these groups.
Fufier

analysis of the hours data for pilots and flight attendants shows that both groups

reported a substantial rise in hours per week from 1979 to 1989. Pilots reported an average of
41.8 hours per week in 1989, versus 37.0 hours per week in 1979 -- a 13 percent increase.
Flight attendants reported 35,7 hours per week in 1989 versus 32.3 hours in 1979 -- an 11
percent incr~.

As a m~hanical

matter, these rises in hours “explain” the discrepancies

betwmn the relative changes in hourly and weekly wages for flying personnel over the 1980s.
Whether this apparent rise in hours is due to-deregulation or to an inherent weakness in the
Census data is less certain. The sample sizes of pilots and flight attendants in the Census files
are reasonably large, ruling out a sampling error explanation. 27 Nevertheless, given actual work
practices in the industry, the average weekly hours reports for pilots and flight attendants in ~
1979 and 1989 seem too high. For example, a pilot flying 85 hours per month works an average
of just under 20 hours per week. In 1979, however, only 29 percent of pilots reported working
less than 30 hours per week; in 1989 this fraction was only 18 percent. The Census data show
a parallel decline in the fraction of flight attendants who report working less than 30 hours per
week (from 43 to 31 percent).

Given the probable inaccuracy of the hours data, some caution

is required in interpreting the hourly wages for pilots and flight attendants.

*’The 1979 file contains 2540 pilots and 2649 flight attendants. The 1989 file contains 3610
pilots and 3646 flight attendants. These counts are consistent with ATA data for employment
in the certified industry, assuming that virtually all flight attendants and about 70-75 ~rcent of
pilots work in the certified industry. The sampling error of measured average hours per week
is about 0.25 hours for both pilots and flight attendants in both years.

21
With this caveat in mind, the results in Table 5 suggest that most occupation groups in
the airline industry experienced a relative dwline in earnings over the 1980s.

The largest

declines are measured for flight attendants (11-18 percent) and the smallest for mechanics (no
change). Perhaps surprisingly, the d~line in the airline indus~
non-s~ialized

wage premium for workers in

occupations is similar in magnitude to the declines for pilots and flight attendants.

Moreover, there is no apparent connection between the size of the post-deregulation decline in
the airline industry wage eff~t and the magnitude of the effect in 1979.
An alternative to measuring the airline wage premium by occupation is to classify workers
by education.

As shown by the results in rows 6 and 7 of Table 5, more and less educated

workers earned fairly similar wage premiums for working in the airline industry in 1979. Over
the 1980s, the premium for more educated workers fell slightly faster (10 versus 6 percentage
pints).

Again, however, one is struck by the similarity rather than the difference in the trend

across ducation groups.
Traditionally, =onomists

have pointed to trade unions as the mechanism by which

workers appropriate rents in regulated industries.

Thus it is interesting to examine post-

deregulatory earnings trends for occupations with negligible union coverage. Two such groups
are managers and secretaries. Since both occupations are broadly represented outside the airline
industry, it is possible to estimate Occupation-specific wage equations that include an airline
industry dummy. The results of this exercise, reported in rows 8 and 9 of Table 5, suggest that
prior to deregulation managers earned about a 14 percent wage advantage for working in the
airline industry, while secretaries earned about an 18 percent premium.

These are the lowest

airline wage differentials re~rted in the table for 1979, and could be interpreted as evidence that

22
non-unionized employees captured few of tie rents from regulation. Nevertheless, both groups
experienced sizeable dwlines in the airline wage premium between 1979 and 1989. IndA,

the

dmline in relative wages of managers in the airline industry is larger than the decline for workers
as a whole. Assuming that the ghan~~ in the airline premium from 1979 to 1989 measures tie
size of regulatory rents, the findings in Table 5 suggest that nonunion occupations like managers
and secretaries earned roughly similar regulatory rent premiums ~ other highly unionized
occupations.

d. C hanees in Wage Dis~rsioq

If wages are linked to firm-s~ific

rents, and the inter-firm dispersion in potential rents

has risen following deregulation, then one might ex~t

deregulation to increase wage inquality,

Table 6 presents some very simple evidence on this issue, using the 1980 and 1990 Census micro
data on hourly and w~kly wages. Throughout the table, earnings dispersion is measured by the
standard deviation of log hourly or weekly wages,

As noted in Table 3, different inequality

indexes give slightly different impressions of the patterns of earnings dispersions in the airline
industry: his should be kept in mind in interpreting the results in Table 6.
The first two rows summarize trends in wage inequality outside the airline indust~.
Although much attention has focused on the rise in wage dispersion over the 1980s (e.g. Levy
and Mumane, 1992) the incr~

in earnings inequality measured in the decennial census data

is relatively modest. Part of the reason for this is the pooling of male and female workers: the
10 percentage point closing of the male-female wage gap over the 1980s (Blau and Kahn, 1995)
lessened a major source of overall wage inequality that is ignored in typical studies of male wage

23
inequality. Based on the census data, the standard deviation of hourly wages outside the airline
~tor

rose about 4 per~nt over the 1980s, while the standard deviation of weekly wages rose

7 percent.
The dispersion of hourly wages in the airline sector rose by slightly less than in other
sectors (3 perunt)

while the dispersion of weekly wages rose by more (13 permnt).

Within

occupation categories the patterns are broadly similar: weekly wages show a larger increase in
inequality than hourly wages; and for most occupation groups the standard deviation of log
weekly wages rose by as much or only slightly more than elsewhere in the labor market. Based
on tiese results, there is only limited support for the hypothesis that deregulation led to a rise
in mings

inequality in the airline industry.

e, CoIlective Barpaininp Contract Dam
Under regulation the airline industry was relatively highly unionized (=
a brief history).

Kahn, 1980 for

Prior to deregulation the pilots at all 11 incumbent trunk airlines were

represented by unions, as were the flight attendants and aircraft mwhanics at all but one firm
(Delta). In the deregulated era, despite the entry of non-union airlines and management efforts
to de-unionize at lat

one major carrier, the fraction of airline industry employees covered by

union contracts has remained stable at around 40 percent (Hirsch and McPherson,

1994b, Tables

12a and 12c). Contrary to trends in the rest of the economy, the propensity of airline workers
for unions seems remarkably robust. For example, pilots and flight attendants at Continental
recently re-established union coverage, while representation elmtions continue to be fought and
won at many new entrant firms.

24
In light of the importance of collective bargaining in the airline industry, it is interesting
to examine contractual wages for the thrm major craft groups in the industry (pilots, flight
attendants, mechanics) and compare trends in the level and inequality of contractual wages with
the patterns estimated using individual micro data. A major limitation of contract data is the lack
of information on the number of workers in ach job category.

In the absence of this

information I have attempted to construct earnings indexes for pilots, flight attendants, and
mechanics assuming a fixed job description and a fixd level of seniority.
The choice of job descriptions and seniority levels is arbitrary, but affects the accuracy
of the index to the extent that wage differentials for different jobs or seniority levels change over
time, or that the distribution of workers across jobs or seniority levels changes over time.
Unfortunately, both factors have changed during the past decade. The emergence of two-tier
labor contracts in the mid- 1980s led to a major rift in wages between more and less senior
workers .28 Although many firms have eliminated their two-tier systems, recent contmcts retain
a much steeper seniority profile than before. With respect to the second factor, the age structure
of one important group -- flight attendants -- has changed significantly since deregulation (see
below). These changes call for careful interpretation of earnings indexes based on a fixed level
of seniority.
Tables 7a-7c provide a summary of average wage rates for pilots, flight attendants, and
mechanics at the major incumbent airlines in 1980, 1987, and early 1995. The tables also show

the number of workers at each firm as of year-end, an employ ment-weightd

average wage (in

current and 1995 dollars), and the coefficient of variation of wages across the incumbent firms.
Table 7a reports hourly wage rates for the captain of a Boeing 727 aircraft with 10 years
of seniority. 29 The contract data show a 13 percent decline in average real wages of captains at
the incumbent trunk airlines since deregulation, with all of the decline occurring betw=n 1980
and 1987. There was also a sharp increase in inter-firm wage dispersion: the coefficient of
variation of hourly wages rose from 4.3 percent in 1980 to 25 percent in 1987. The increase
in dispersion in the early 1980s was attributable to wage cuts or frwzes at five financial y
troubled airlines: Braniff, Continental, &stem, Pan Am, and Transworld. 30 By the WI y 1990s
three of these firms had failed, while Continental pilots had re-unionized and negotiated a modest
pay increase relative to rates at the industry l=ders (American, Delta, and United).

These

factors, along with the relative rise in employment at the 3 leading firms, led to some narrowing
of intefilrm dispersion from 1987 to 1995. On net, however, the contract data show a widening
of inequality for unionized pilots after deregulation.
Union contract wage scales for flight attendants are presentd in Table 7b. By the mid1980s, most incumbents had negotiated two-tier pay schedules for flight attendants, with a typical
30 percent wage reduction for newly hired workers. I have shown wages for both the high and
low tiers in the table -- in each case, assuming 5 years of seniority. The introduction of two tier

captains’ wages, although there is clearly some effect on wages for first and second officers (see
Walsh (1988), Table 3).

employees reported in Tables 7a-7c are from company employment policy statements.

26
schedules makes it difficult to construct an average wage across firms: I have used a simple
average of the two scales in constructing the industry average wage and coefficient of variation.
The mntract data for flight attendants show a large (40 percent) fall in average real wage
rates from 1980 to 1995, with a somewhat bigger decline after 1987 than before. An important
factor in interpreting theses trends, however, is the role of seniority. The d~line in wages for
flight attendants with 5 years of seniority overstates the decline in wages for a representative
flight attendant for two reasons. First, the average age of flight attendants increased by 7 years
betw~n 1979 and 1995, implying a substantial upward shift in seniority .31 Second, as firms
have moved to eliminate permanent two-tier pay schedules, they have increased the slope of the
seniority wage gradient for flight attendants. 32 Even allowing for these factors, however, the
contract data suggest that flight attendant rd

wages have fallen since deregulation.

The trend

in wage dispersion is also positive, although the rise in inter-firm wage differentials is smaller
than for pilots.
Finally, Table 7Creports union contract wage rates for aircraft mechanics. Traditiondly,
mechanics’ contracts contained relatively limited seniority provisions, with rates reaching a
maximum after only 2 years.

More recently the airlines have negotiated extended seniority

3lIn 1979 the average age of flight attendants was 30.4 yms -- far below the average age
of 36.2 for the workforce as a whole. The pooled March 1994/95 CPS files show an average
age of 37.7 for flight attendants versus a labor force average age of 38.0.
32For example, the USAir-flight attendant contracts in the late 1970s and early 1980s
increased wages by about 40 percent in the first 5 years of seniority, and a futiher 14 percent
in the next 5. The 1986 contmct introduced a second-tier pay schedule for new hires, with 25-30
percent lower pay rates. The 1988 contract eliminated the second tier, but effectively retained
the lower tier pay rate for low-seniority workers, so that pay rates rose only 17 percent in the
first 5 years of seniority but then incread 60 percent in the next 5 years.

27
schdules

that lowered wages by 20-30 percent in the first 4 or 5 years of employment.

Compared to pilots and flight attendants, however, the mechanics’ seniority schedules are still
relatively compressed .33 Thus Table 7C presents wage rates for mechanics at the top of the
seniority scale.
Adjusted for inflation, the average union contract wage for mechanics shows little change
beween 1980 and 1987 and then a roughly 10 percent drop from 1987 to 1995. The trend in
wage dis~rsion is similar to the trend for pilots, although dampened, with a rise from 1980 to
1987 and then a fall from 1987 to 1995. Apti from Continental, inter-firm wage differentials
for mechanics were very small in 1995.34
How do the trends in collective bargaining pay scales mesh with the findings in Tables
4-6 based on Census and CPS microdata? For pilots, the microdata show a modest decline in
_

wages while tie con~ct dab show a 10 percent d~line in r~

wage m.

Assuming

that real wage rates of non-airline workers were roughly constant, the trends in pilot wages are
therefore roughly consistent across the two sources.

The trends in wage inequality are not,

however, since the Census data show little increase in inquality,

while the contract data show

a sharp rise in inter-firm inequality, Part of the discrepancy may be attributable to problems of
measurement error in the Census and CPS earnings and hours data. Part may also be due to the
fact that pilots hold a very diverse set of jobs in the broadly defined airline industry -- from

33Furthermore, the extended seniority schedules have not always been binding. For example,
the September 1985 mwhanics’ agreement at American offered accelerated seniority to workers
on the extended seniority schedule,
34Asof 1995, Continental m~hanics are still nonunion. Delta mechanics are also nonunion,
although their pay scales are comparable to those at American.

28
flying single-engine air taxis to large commercial jets. Relative to the overall distribution of pay
across all these jobs, the dispersion in pay for captains in the certified airlines is small.
For flight attendants, the microdata show a 10-17 percent dwline in relative wages and
a significant incr-

in wage inequality, while the contract data show a 40 percent d=line in real

wage levels and a rise in both inter-firm and within-firm wage inequality. As discussed above,
the decline in the real wage rate at a fixed point in the seniority scale for flight attendants clearly
overstates the decline in real wages for a representative worker. Thus, the trends in the levels
of rd

wages in the contract data and micro data may be roughly consistent.

It is difficult to

assess the effects of two-tier pay schedules and steepened seniority schedules on the level of wage
inequality for flight attendants. Supetilcially, the inequality trends in the contract and micro data
are broadly compatible.
Finally, Census and CPS microdata for mechanics show roughly constant relative wages
since deregulation and a modest rise in wage inequality, while the contract data show an 11
percent dwline in rd

wage Ievel$ and a small increase in inter-firm inquality.

Although these

trends may seem inconsistent, recall that the Census microdata actually show falling average
wage rates for mechanics relative to all non-airline workers.35 After taking account of age,
education, gender, and other observable factors, however, mechanics’ relative wages were
constant between 1979 and 1989. The key adjustment factors are education and gender: airline
mechanics are over 90 percent male and have lower-than-average education. Adjusting for the

35According to the data in Table 4, the unadjusted airline m~hanic wage differential falls
from 0.473 to 0.347 from 1979 to 1989, The adjusted differential, however, is 0.216 in 179 and
0.224 in 1989.

29
relative pay declines of men and less-educated workers over the 1980s, airline mechanics kept
pace with similar workers in other sectors. Thus, the earnings trends for mechanics in the union
mntracts and microdata are broadly compatible.

Census/CPS microdata and union contract data both suggest that mings

in the airline
A simple

interpretation of this fact is that airline wages contained a regulatory rent premium that was
gradually eliminated after deregulation. Another way to measure the regulatory wage premium
among airline workers is to compare the earnings changes of individuals who lost jobs in the
airline industry during the 1980s with the earnings changes of other job-losers. 34 One might
ex~t
mings

former airline workers to experience above-average wage losses if their pre-displacement
included a rent premium.

Indd,

the difference in wage changes betw=n former

airline workers and other workers is one potential estimate of the regulatory rent premium. 37
To the extent that job-losers from other sectors also earned non-competitive wage premia,
however, the difference in wage changes between former airline workers and other job-losers
may understate the sim of regulatory rents in the airline sector.

3bHirschand McPherson (1994a, Table 7) analyze year-to-year wage changes using a sample
of individuals who are intemiewed in consecutive years in the CPS, pooled with a sample of
individuals who report both their wage for the previous year and the wage on their current job
as of the March CPS survey.
37Displaced workers are typically a non-random sample of workers from a given sector.
Thus any comparison of wage changes for job-losers from different sectors implicitly assumes
that the degree of selectivity bias in the observed distribution of wage changes is similar for
workers from the different ~tors.

30
The DisplaA

Worker Suneys (DWS) conducted by the Census Bureau in January 1984,

1986, 1988, 1990, 1992, and February 1994 asked individuals if they had lost a job in the
previous 5 years (3 years in the 1994 sumey), and if so, their earnings on the old job and their
current job. 3a Table 8 presents some descriptive statistics on the set of job losers interviewed
in the combined displaced worker surveys, and on the subset of these individuals displaced from
jobs in the airline industry.

Each of the DWS surveys includes 7,000-9,000 job losers.

Nevertheless, the total number of former airline workers is only 342 (0.7 percent of the sample,
or about the same fraction as airline workers comprise of the overall workforce). The relatively
low number of airline job losers reflects the small size of the airline industry and the fact that
industry employment has actually expanded at about the same rate as the overall labor force since
deregulation.
The characteristics of workers displaced from the airline industry present an interesting
contrast with other displaced workers and with the stock of workers employed in the industry.
For example, former airline workers are better-educated and more likely to be men than other
displaced workers: both f=tures are consistent with the data for the currently employed airline
workers in the 1980 or 1990 Census (~

Table 3). The ratio of mean weekly earnings of ex-

airline employees to the mean earnings of all displaced workers is 1.29; the ratio of the
corresponding medians is 1.45. This 30-45 percent wage premium is slightly less than the crosssectional wage premium for airline workers in 1979 (45-60 percent according to the data in
Tables 3-4) but closer to the cross-wtional

premium in 1989 (roughly 30-40 percent). As shown

38The DWS surveys have been used by many previous authors -- see Farber (1996) for a
recent analysis.

31
in the tiird wlumn of the table, the general nature of the airline industry group is similar when
pilots ue excluded, although pilots tend to have higher education and higher wages than other
workers.
Relative to other displad

workers, the post-displacement experienws of former airline

workers show some interesting differences and similarities.

Airline and non-airline workers

re~fl comparable unemployment experiences after a job loss, but airline workers are more likely
to be re-employed at the survey date and more likely to have moved geographically after
displacement.

They are also more likely to return to jobs in their pre-displacement industry: at

the survey date 39 percent of airline workers were re-employed in the airline industry versus an
average industry re-employment rate of 25 percent. Despite these differences, the mean wage
change conditional on re-employment is very similar for former airline workers and other
displaced workers (see row 50. Moreover, the fractions of ex-airline workers who experienced
bigger than 10 percent wage losses or gains are similar to the fractions for other displaced
workers (rows 5g, 5h).
Table 9 presents a series of estimated regression models that attempt to measure any
airline-specific effect in the pre- to post-displacement wage change.

With one exception

(explained below) the models are fit to the subsample of individuals who report valid predisplacement and post-displacement wages. The model in column 1 includes only a dummy
variable for pre-displawment jobs in the airline industry. The model in column 2 adds a set of
standard covariates, while the model in COIU
mn 3 excludes pilots, Finally, the models in columns
4-6 examine the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the wage change distribution, respectively,
using a standard quantile regression technique.

32
The estimates in columns 1-6 of Table 9 imply that workers displaced from the airline
industry experien~

very similar wage changes to workers displaced from other industries.

Although the standard errors are relatively large, the point estimates are numeridly

small and

renter on zero. The estimates rule out an airline-specific effect any larger than +/- 10 percent,
both at the mean, and at the median, 25th ~rcentile,

and 75th percentile of the wage change

distribution.
One difficulty with drawing inferences from the models in columns 1-6 is that the
underlying sample excludes individuals who were still unemployed as of the displaced worker
survey date. Since airline workers have higher re-employment rates than other workers, it is
possible that the estimated airline effect on ~ccepted wage offers is a biased estimate of the airline
effect on ptenti~

wage opportunities.

To explore this possibility, I assigned all non-workers

at the time of the survey a log wage change of -1. I then estimated a quantile regression for the
75th percentile of wage changes.

Since the 75th percentile of log wage changes for this

augmented sample is above -1, this is quivalent

to assuming that displaced workers who were

unemployed at the suwey date would have experienced a wage change below the 75th percentile
if they had accepted their best job opportunisty,
Estimates of this model are reported in column 7 of Table 9.

Comparisons of the

coefficient estimates for the control variables in columns 2-6 with those in column 7 show some
interesting differences. For example, the nonwhite effect is negligible in the conditional models
in columns 2-6 but large and negative in the unconditional model in column 7, implying that
nonwhite displa~

workers have lower re-employment rates than whites, but similar wage

changes conditional on re-employment.

The estimated airline industry effect in column 7 is

33
relatively imprecise but positive. Even accounting for the likelihood of re-employment, there is
clearly no evidence that airline workers experienced bigger wage losses than other displaced
worker.
A second issue in interpreting the results in Table 9 is the timing of job losses in the
sample. The 1984-1994 Displaced Worker Surveys include individuals who lost jobs between
1979 and 1994. If the regulatory rents -ed

by airline workers eroded over the 1980s, then

the wages of airline job losers from the later part of the sample period may have already fallen
prior to their displacement.
m~ured

In this case, the relative wage changes of ex-airline workers

in Table 9 may understate the average regulatory wage premiums earned prior to

deregulation. To check this possibility, Ire- estimated the models including only job losers from
1979 to 1985. Contrary to the hpthesis

of bigger relative wage losses for airline workers in

the early 1980s, the estimates show the opposite pattern: the estimated airline job effects are
slightly more positive than those reported in Table 9 (with slightly larger standard errors).
As notd in Table 8, one of the interesting differences between job losers from the airline
industry and other displaced workers is the relatively lower fraction of airline workers who
changed industries after their displacement.

Previous studies of displaced workers have found

that industry changers suffer bigger wages losses than non-changers.39 Thus the lower rate of
industry switching among airline job losers may account for their relatively favorable
post-displacement earnings experiences.
compare the pre- to postdisplacement

Table 10 presents a series of regression models that

These models include a dummy variable for industry switchers, a dummy variable indicating a

34
pre-displacement job in the airline sector, and the interaction of the two effects.

To aid in

interpreting the estimates the rows 4 and 5 of the table show the implied wage changes of airline
job losers who were re-employed in the airline industry, and those who were not, relative to an
average displaced worker from other wtors.
The estimates in Table 10 wnfirm that on average, displaced workers who change industries
have significantly larger wage losses (i.e., more negative wage changes) than industry stayers.
For displa~

workers from the airline ~tor,

however, there are no significant differences

between the wage changes of industry stayers and industry movers.

Wth groups have larger

wage losses than industry stayers displaced from other industries but smaller wage losses than
industry switchers displaced from other industries. a
relatively imprecise, they suggest that the industry -s~ific

Although the coefficient estimates are
component of pre-displacement wages

for ex-airline workers is actually smaller than the industry-specific component for most other
displaced workers.
A simple interpretation of the patterns of relative wage changes among airline job losers
and other displaced workers is that the pre-displacement “rents” earned by airline workers were
of comparable magnitude to the “rents” (or returns to industry-specific human capital) earned by
displaced workers from other industries.

Thus the patterns of relative wage changes for job

losers from the Displaced Worker Surveys reinforce the conclusion from Census microdata and
union contract data that airline workers wed

relatively modest industry-specific wage premiums

in the regulated era.

~ re-estimated the models in Table 10 using only job losers from 1979 to 1985 and found
very similar results.

35
Iv.

Summarv and Co nclusion~
Airline workers’ relative wages have declined by about Opercentsince 1980. Assuming

that the deregulate

industry can be taken as a competitive benchmark, this shift implies that

airline workers received about a 10 percent wage premium under regulation. There are several
explanations for the moderate size of this rent premium. Non-price competition in the regulated
airline industry was relatively strong, and may have dissipated a substantial fraction of potential
regulatory rents. Mormver, airline unions never succeeded in “taking wages out of competition”
through industry-wide bargaining.

Relative to employms in other regulated industries, airline

workers may have been less successful in capturing a share of the rents created by regulation.
An alternative explanation for the modest d~line in airline wages since 1980 is that
employ=s at many firms are still earning rents. Even in the deregulated marketplace the larger
airline firms have b=n able to retain a degree of market power through hub-and-spoke route
networks and the strategic control of computer reservation systems. Indeed, the airline industry
is more concentrate

now than in the dwades prior to deregulation.

Evidence from the

experiences of job losers, however, suggests that airline workers do not suffer l~ger wage losses
following a job displacement that job-losers from other industries. Moreover, airline job-losers
who are change industries fare about as well as those who are re-employed in the airline
industry.

Taken together with the cross-sectional evidence, these patterns suggest that any

regulatory or non-competitive rents earned by airline workers are relatively modest, and
comparable to the wage premiums earned in many other =tors.
Perhaps more surprising than the size of the post-deregulation wage daline
uniformity across different wcupation groups.

is its

Wages declined by about as much for highly

36
unioti

industry -s~ific

uupations

like pilots and flight attendants M for nonunion

occupations like managers and =retaries.

The apparent similarity of the rent premiums aed

by these disparate groups rules out any s~ial

rent-shifting role for unions, and seems to support

alternative models of rent-sharing.
The dispersion in wages within the airline sector has also risen after deregulation.
Individual microdata from the 1980 and 1990 Census suggest that the incr-s

in earnings

inequality for most oe.eupation groups were comparable to or slightly larger than the increases
experienced in other sectors of the economy over the 1980s. Union contract data for three main
occupation groups (pilots, flight attendants, mmhanics) show a noticeable rise in inter-firm wage
inequality, especially for pilots. The magnitude of the wage differentials across firms has closed
somewhat since the mid- 1980s, but remains high: up to 40 ~rcent for pilots, and 10-30 percent
for flight attendants.
Despite the passage of nearly two decades since the lifting of airline regulation, the full
impact of deregulation is still unclw.

Many of the surviving incumbent airline firms are in a

relatively precarious financial condition, and their employees continue to face demands for wage
cuts. It may take another 20 years to reach a complete assessment of the labor market effects
of deregulation.

Data ADDendix
1. Census and CPS Microda@
The wples

used in Tables 3-6 are based on extracts from the 1980 and 1990 5-percent Census

public use micro sample files, and the March 1994 and March 1995 Current Population Surveys.
The census files include individuals age 16 and older with positive non-allocated earnings,
psitive weeks of work and positive hours per week in the previous year, who report a valid nonallocated 3-digit industry for their main job in the last year. The final census extracts include
all individuals who worked in the airline industry (Census industry code 421) and a 5 percent
random sample of all other workers. The CPS extracts include all individuals age 16 and older
with positive non-allocated earnings, positive w~ks of work and positive hours per week in the
previous year.

For the earnings models I fufiher limit the 1980 sample to individuals with

average hourly earnings between $2 and $84 per hour and average weekly earnings under $3360;
the 1990 sample to individuals with average hourly earnings between $3.17 and $132 per hour
and average weekly earnings under $5280; and the 1994-95 sample to individuals with average
hourly earnings between $3.50 and $150 per hour and average weekly earnings under $6000.

2. Displaced Worker SumevS
The samples used in Tables 8-10 include all individuals in the 1984, 1986, 1988, 1990, 1992,
and 1994 displaced worker supplements who reported losing a job in the previous 5 years
(previous 3 y~s

in 1994). Individuals who report a weekly wage of less than $10 per week are

excluded from the earnings analysis.

The models reported in Tables 9 and 10 are fit to a

subsample of observations with non-missing data on age, year of displacement, tenure on the

42
previous job, education,and weekly earnings on the predisplacement and post-displaement job
(in column 7 of Table 9 the -pie

Notes: Employment counts include captains, first and second officers, and
flight engineers. Wage rates are calculated for a captain of a
Boeing 727 aircraft, flying 50 percent night hours, with 10 years
of seniority. Wages are obtained from union contracts on file with
National Mediation Board or other sources. Employment counts
are from Form 41 reports (1980 and 1987) or IATA World Air Transport
Statistics (1995). Average wages in 1995 do not include Transworld.

Notes: Wage rates are calculated for a flight attendent with 5 years of
seniority flying 65 hours per month. In cases where two rates are
reported, the second pertains to the wage for employees on the
lower scale of a two-tier pay system. Weighted average wages in
bottom two rows assume one half of of employees work at the lower-tier
wage. See Table 7a for sources.
