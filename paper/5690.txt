PERCEPTIONS OF ECONOMIC
INSECURITY: EVIDENCE FROM
THE SURVEY OF ECONOMIC
EXPECTATIONS
ABSTRACT

We have recently initiated the Survey of Economic Expectations

(SEE) in an effort to learn

how Americans perceive their near-term futures. This paper uses SEE data on over two thousand
labor force participants interviewed in 1994 and 1995 to describe how Americans in the labor force
perceive the risk of near-term economic misfortune.

We measure economic insecurity through

responses to questions eliciting subjective probabilities of three events in the year ahead: absence
of health insurance, victimization by burglary, and job loss. With item response rates exceeding 98
percent, respondents clearly are willing to answer the expectations questions and they appear to do
so in a meaningful way. Using the responses to classify individuals as relatively secure, relatively
insecure, and highly insecure, we find that respondents with a high risk of one adverse outcome tend
also to perceive high risks of the other outcomes. Economic insecurity tends to decline with age and
with schooling.

Black respondents perceive much greater insecurity than do whites, especially

among males. Within the period 1994-1995, we find some time-series variation in insecurity but no
clear trends. We find that expectations and realizations of health insurance coverage and of jobs tend
to match up quite closely, but respondents substantially overpredict the risk of burglary.

1. Introduction

During the first few months of 1996, economic insecurity became a focus of
media attention in the United States.

The New York Times (March 3-9) ran a week-

long series on “The Downsizing of America,”

Business Week (March 11) devoted a

cover story to “Economic Anxiety,” and The Economist (April 6) offered its own
perspective

on

“Learning

with

economic

insecurity.

This

public

discourse coincided with policy proposals intended to reduce insecurity, such as
the Kassebaum-Kennedy

bill

(S 1028) to

increase

the

portability

of

health

insurance and the “American Workers Economic Security Act” to reduce taxes on
corporations which “treat workers fairly” and to restrain corporate mergers and
acquisitions, among other provisions (Kennedy, 1996).
Attention to insecurity is by no means new.

Advocating

“some safeguards

against misfortunes which cannot be wholly eliminated in this man-made world,”
Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed a cabinet Committeeon
(reprinted in Davis,

1986, p.449).

years later, the Federal Reserve Board’s Consultant Committee on Consumer Survey

Perhaps the available survey data show no increase in insecurity because
the apparent trend is simply an artifact of media hype in a presidential election
year.

Or perhaps increased insecurity is not detected because the surveys are

not well-suited to monitor the phenomenon.

perceptions

of near-term

economic insecurity through their responses to questions eliciting subjective
probabilities of three events:

Health Insurance: “What do you think is the percent chance (what are the chances
out of 100) that you will have health insurance coverage 12 months from now?”

Burglary: “What do you think is the percent chance (what are the chances out of
100) that someone will break into (or somehow illegally enter) your home and
steal something, during the next 12 months?”

Job LOSS: “What do you think is the percent chance that you will lose your job
during the next 12 months?”

3
All respondents are asked the first two questions, and those currently working
are asked the third.
The use of probabilistic questions to elicit individuals’ expectations has
been recommended by Juster (1966), Savage (1971), Manski (1990), and Fischhoff
(1994), each of whom concludes that probabilistic questions should yield more

We find that respondents with

a high risk of one adverse outcome tend also to perceive high risks of the other
outcomes.

We find that economic insecurity tends to decline with age and with

schooling.

Black respondents perceive much greater insecurity than do whites,

especially among males.
With only two years of data, we cannot provide an historical perspective
on trends in economic insecurity but we can examine how expectations of economic
misfortune have varied recently.

This is done in Section 5, where we find some

time-series variation in insecurity but no clear trends.

however, limits the usefulness

elicit subjective probabilities of health insurance coverage,

of subjective economic insecurity.

The areas of concern

are: qualitative

The Italian SHIM and Dutch VSB-Pane7 Surveys:

Two European surveys include

questions eliciting subjective probabilities of one-year-ahead growth rates in
income.

Responses to the Bank of Italy’s 1989 Survey of Household

Income and

9
Wealth (SHIW) have been analyzed by Guiso et al. (1992), who focus on the effect
of income uncertainty on savings behavior.

We are not aware of any analyses of

responses to similar questions contained in the more recent, continuing VSB-Panel
survey conducted by the Center for Economic Research in Tilburg, Netherlands.

The Carnegie Mellon Studies of Risk Perceptions:

The Social and Decision

Sciences group at Carnegie Mellon University has undertaken a series of smallscale studies

(e.g., less than 300 subjects drawn

from the Pittsburgh

their perceived risks of becomi ng alcohol dependent, getting mugged, and becoming

Numbers like:

2 or 5 percent may be “almost no chance”
20 percent or so may mean “not much chance”
a 45 or 55 percent chance may be a “pretty even chance”
80 percent or so may mean a “very good chance”
and a 95 or 98 percent chance may be “almost certain”
The percent chance can also be thought of as the number of CHANCES

on economic insecurity.

3.4. The Sample Distribution of Risk Perceptions

We can summarize the central tendency of the responses reported in Table
2 by giving their sample means and medians.

For health insurance, the sample

mean and median subjective probabilities are .15 and .02. For burglary, they are
.17 and .10.

For job loss, they are .18 and .05.

some respondents think the event moderately or even very likely to occur.
To more fully summarize the heterogeneity of risk percept ons we present
several quantiles of the sample distribution of the responses:

half of all respondents would have pj less than the empirical median and half

Hence, under the statistical independence

be (.5)3 = .125, and the fraction highly insecure would be
(.25)3 = .016.
Because the empirical distributions are discrete with some mass at their medians

All SEE respondents were asked these three questions:

illegally get into your home and steal something?

The job loss question, which is one of the core

WISCON questions, does not correspond as well to the expectations question. 5

unemployed job seekers over the past 12 months have lost a job rather than left
one voluntarily or recently entered the labor force and (ii) all job losers over

Should condition

Our findings do seem to corroborate

the conventional wisdom that Americans perceive crime to be far more prevalent
than it actually is (see Bursik and Grasmick, 1993, Chapter 4).
