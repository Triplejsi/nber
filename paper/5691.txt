Dynamic Complementarities:

A Quantitative Analysis

I. Introduction
This paper seeks to address a major difficulty in the current literature on business

serial correlation in output is less than .03. This is quite low relative to the observed serial

This problem affects not just models of the real business

such as demand side

One remedy, adopted in many real business cycle models, is to simply build in the

Instead of imposing such restrictions,

it is possible to overcome the problem of

identifying these parameters by taking advantage of the cross sectional variation available at
the two digit industry level. To do so requires us to depart slightly from the theoretical model
we have specified since the identification

rests on the existence of sector specific movements in

productivity.
Consider an economy in which aggregate manufacturing

is divided into sectors indexed

by j = 1,... ,J, each with a share ~j of total value added. Then the sectoral production

Summing over the j sectors

gives exactly the aggregate production function specified in equation (8), as long as the shares
do not vary from one period to another.

Our data-set was obtained from a variety of sources. Annual 2-digit value added,

These series run from 1952 to 1986. The annual 2-digit data on sectoral electricity

One way of addressing this issue further is to force

The final row in Table 1, IV-CRS, is a regression in the spirit of Baxter-King
that forces constant returns to scale.

[1991]

To do so, we create an input measure from a weighted

average of labor (.64) and electricity (.36).

This input measure is subtracted from output to

create a measure of the Solow residual which is then regressed on the two complementarities.
The results provide additional support for the presence of both complementarities:

compared to the results from an iid technology shock.

This intuition is borne out

in row 1 of Table 5 and in the impulse responses, Figures 4-6.
