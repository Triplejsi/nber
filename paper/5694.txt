spending following the end of the cold war.

Our model suggests that the

worldwide “peace dividend” may be smaller than one might expect. The reason is that the
per capita costs of defense may increase in smaller countries that have to deal with more
numerous potential regional conflicts.
This paper joins two strands of the analytical

literature.

One is the economic

literature on the size of countries, as in the work by Friedman (1977), Casella and Feinstein
(1990) and Wei (1992).’

Specifically, we build upon Alesina and Spolaore (1995), where

the consideration of potential international conflicts and the cost of defense.

The second line

of research is the literature on conflict resolution and arms races recently surveyed by
Sandier and Hartley (1995).

Olson and Zeckhauser (1966) and Ttilock (1974).

The distance

We assume that this distance captures

Hence, the location

of a government captures both a position on an ideological dimension and on a geographical
line. As discussed in more detail in Alesina and Spolaore (1995), this assumption ensures
that countries are geographically

connected.

An alternative assumption would be to retain

only the preference interpretation

of distance and then impose costs on non geographically

connected countries. For the purpose of this paper the “preference” interpretation

of distance

is not necessary, although it makes the model richer.
Individual utility is given by:
Ui=zi-ti-gli

where Zi is the total income available to individual i , ti are his taxes, li is the distance of
individual i fi-om his govemmen$ and g is a positive parameter.
linear in private consumption

Thus, individual utility is

(zi - ti ) and linear in the distance from the public good.

The utility deriving from the public good is highest for li = O.

4
The cost of a government

is K, irrespectively

of the size of the country.

This

specification captures in the simplest possible way the benefit of “size” of a country.4

In

facg with a fixed cost of government the average per capita cost of financing is decreasing
with the size of the country.
In reality, the benefits of country size derive from several fixed costs, including
creating and maintaining a monetary system, a bureaucracy,

a tax collection system. Also,

in a world of less than perfect free trade, the size of markets is affected by the size of
political jurisdictions,

In the extieme case of complete autarky the two coincide: the market

size is the size of the country.

Thus, in any model with increasing returns in the size of the

market economy, and some barriers to international trade, income is increasing in the size
of the country.5

Also, even though this argument is not explicitly accounted for in the

model, a large country can provide insurance to its regions, needed because of regional
idiosyncratic shocks.b Thus, in equilibrium the size of countries emerges from a trade-off,
Large countries can take advantage of the benefits of size, but are less homogeneous

a larger popdation has more diverse preferences. As the size of a country increases, the cost

5
We now consider the role of international conflict and defense spending.

Individual

resources Zi are divided into two components:
zi=y+ei

(2)

y is individual income (equal for everybody), which is “safe” from the consequences

of

conflict; ei is the expected amount of resources available to individual i afier a @ossible)
international conflict is resolved.
Conflict is modeled as follows.

Individuals are randomly matched pairwise.

When

a pair (i, j) meets, the two individuals generate a pool of resources equal to 2 e which has
to be divided. There are two possible states: conflict (c) and no conflict (n c). In a state
of n c resources are distributed (peacefully) and equally:
ei=ej=e

(3)

We assume that:
Al:

If two individuals who belong to the same country meet, they are always in a

state of no conpict,
If two individuals, i andj, who do not belong to the same country meet, they can either be
in conflict or in no conflict, in which case (3) applies.

Conflict occurs with probability

Al rules out domestic

In fact we could assume an additional cost for a country for internal “law and

ordef’ and conflict resolution (courts, legal system etc.). If this cost were increasing in the
size of the country, it would provide an additional argument for the costs of size, in addition
to the “average distance” argument emphasized above. If these costs were linear, our results
would be completely unaffected, If these costs were decreasing in the size of countries (i. e.,
economies of scale in law and order) they would provide an additional benefit for size.
The second assumption borrows from the literature on conflict resolution,

Two observations emerge immediately from the structure of the model:

The first observation derives from the fact, embodied in (7), that every individual has the
sme probability of meeting a foreigner and individual payoffs all depend identically on the
country’s aggregate level of defense. This result would not hold if, for instance, individuals
close to the borders had a higher change of engaging in conflicts with foreigners.

In the

latter case, border individuals would prefer a higher spending on defense.

Assumption A6 implies that taxes cannot be a function of the (unique) parameter which

in two ways. First, to the extent that individual location captures a preference dimension,

Note, however, that given our assumption of uniform distribution of individuals,

equilibria with equally-sized countries are the natural candidates.

Several observations

are in order.

First, the equilibrium

amount of defense is

increasing in the probability of conflict. Not surprisingly, it is also increasing in the amount
of the payoff from conflict e. Second, defense spending is zero when there is only one
country in the world, since, by deftition,

there is no conflict.

Fourth, since defense is, from the point of view of global efficiency, pure

13
waste, individual utility would be maximized if p = O and d * = O. In fact, if p > 0
and d~ = d * for every country using (7) one can verifi that ei = e for every i, exactly
as in the case of p = O. When p > 0, however, the “price” of the payoff e is the per capita
cost of defense given in ( 12). Obviously, we have a suboptimd Nash equilibrium on defense
spending.
Empirically,

the relationship

between

country

size and defense per capita is

influenced by two critical factors which our model does not capture: the existence of military
alliances,

and the fact that smaller members of an alliance can free ride on the defense

capabilities of the larger member(s).9 Both considerations are very important, and we do not
mean to downplay them. However, we see our model as a stepping stone upon which to
build these additional realistic features.
We now consider border redrawing by majority rule. We allow the existing countries
to eliminate a country or create a new country if the border change is approved by majority
rule in each of the countries whose borders are affected by the change. We restrict voting
only on proposals of border redrawing which satis& Requirement

If we view the end of the cold

One codd expect that a large fall in the probability of conflict p (The “end of the cold

in the per capita cost of defense.

However, the emergence of several local conflicts cast

“matches”.

The second, and indirect effect, is that a reduction in p reduces the size of

to conflict. As equation ( 16) shows, for F small the direct effect dominates, for ~ large it
does not. Therefore, stig

and 2’,
We now turn to the issue of stability to unilateral secessions.

A unilateral secession

occurs when a (connected) set of individuals belonging to an existing country unilaterally
forms a new country,
Definition:

A country of size s is secession free, ~fno group of citizens would want to

unilaterally break away andform a new count~.
First of all, note that if a secession occurs, three adjustments have to occur:
i) the location of govement

and defense spending of the new country;

ii) the location of government and the defense spending of the country which has been
split, and
iii) the defense spending of all the other countries not affected by the secession.
While for the case of the e- stability the third adjustment was “second order,” this is
not the case for (potentially large) unilateral secessions.

Thus, we cannot derive results

analogous to Proposition 5.
Note that the individuals with the highest incentives to break away are those located
far away from the government near the borders of the original country,

In fact, for given

country size, and given size of a secession, those who gain the most are those who were far
from the original government and are much closer to the government of the new country.
Clearly, the possibility of secessions impose an upper limit on country size. If a country is
too large, a fraction of its citizens at the border would break away because they are so far

22
from the government that they are willing to bear the costs of a higher defense bill and total
tax per capita, and lower total defense in a conflictual world.
The fist question which we ask is whether the configuration of R countries of equal
size~.y

1

is secession free. Numerical simulations described in the Appendix show the
N
following results:
Result.

The size ~ is secession free.
The simtiations imply a search over a grid of values for possible secession sizes. We

then check whether or not all the individuals in the proposed break away region are better
off after the secession.

A country is secession free if we cannot fmd a size for a possible

secession in which all the individuals who are breaking away are better off. Note that this
procedure implies (rather realistically) that nobody can be forced to unilaterally break away
from an existing country against his will.
A second interesting question is the following.

Leaving aside Requirement

is the relationship between p and the minimum size which is secession free?

2, what

By numerical

simulations, described in Appendix we obtain the following:
Result:

The maximum size that is secession free is increasing in p.
In other words, when the probability of a conflict increases, larger countries that

would not have been secession-free for a smaller p become secession free. Conversely, a
sharp drop in p would induce certain regions to secede, which would not have seceded with
a higher p. Therefore, even leaving aside the equilibrium number of countries ~ obtained

23
applying

Requirement

2, this result on secessions establishes that one should observe a

break-up of countries when, for whatever reason, the probability of conflict decreases.
This observation is quite important because it underlies the generality of the direct
relationship

between country size and probability of international

conflict.

In fact, this

relationship emerges simply as a result of the secession-free requirement, regardless of any
other requirement which (like Requirement 2) identifies a specific equilibrium number of
countries.

Third, the size of the ‘peace

the likelihood of international conflict.
While these implications of the model appear quite consistent with recent events, we
should

emphasize

several limitations

of our approach.

First and foremost,

we have

completely ignored the role of alliances and the related problem of free riding in defense
spending by smaller members.

To some extent, one can reinterpret the ‘country’ of our

model as a group of allied countries, and view our model of country formation as a model
of alliance formation, However, the analogy can be pushed only to a point, because critical

mechanisms. Although these concepts may be appropriate to study a completely democratic

However,

the general principles behind our results are likely to be robust with respect to different
specifications of the process of country formation.

For instance, Spolaore (1995a) derives

similar restits for the case of a world in which governments are modeled as rent-maximizing
Leviathans.

Fifth, our assumption concerning the identity between the geographic

preference dimension excludes the consideration of ethnic minorities.

model, in fact an ethnic minority could be viewed as a group of individuals with preferences

These extensions are lefi for fiture research.

Despite all these caveats, the contribution of this paper consists in building if not a

In words, for a small perturbation of the border between two countries, total defense

smaller country.
