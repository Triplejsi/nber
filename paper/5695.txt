QUOTA LICENSES FOR IMPORTED
CAPITAL EQUIPMENT: COULD
BUREAUCRATS EVER DO BETTER THAN
THE MARKET?

ABSTRACT

Despite valid criticisms, many developing countries have issued non-transferable

import

licenses to a limited number of final-good producers so as to restrict imports of an input, such as
capital equipment.

This paper demonstrates that for a given import quota, such licensing restrictions

can actually increase domestic production of both the input and the final product, but at the cost of
reduced quota rents. Under pure competition, domestic welfare falls relative to the use of marketable
quota licenses, but if foreigners would get the quota rents, or if external economies cause decreasing
costs, then bureaucratic allocation can dominate.

As previously

mentioned,

a critical distinction is between

“dual-price”

licensing schemes and licensing schemes in which there is a “unified market” for
the input (marginal costs are equaliti).

Under a dual-price

scheme,

the value

X of an additional license to a license holder is below the value y = f
a non-license

holder and there are some non-license

A < rD - rF is equivalent

to PF < P, license holders then face a lower marginal

Hence trading in

the specific factor prior to the allocation of quota licenses gives rise to the same
outcome as if the licenses themselves were tradeable.
