WHY ARE THERE RICH AND POOR
COUNTRIES?: SYMMETRY-BREAKING
IN THE WORLD ECONOMY

ABSTRACT

To explain
coordination

cross-country

differences

in economic

performance,

the economics

of

failures typically portrays each country in a closed economy model with multiple

equilibria and then argues that the poor countries are in an equilibrium inferior to those achieved by
the rich. This approach cannot tell us anything about the degree of inequality in the world economy.
A more satisfactory approach would be to build a world economy model and show why it has to be
separated into the rich and the poor regions, i.e., to demonstrate the co-existence of the rich and poor
as an inevitable aspect of the world trading system, In the present model, the symmetry-breaking
of the world economy

into the rich and the poor occurs because international

trade causes

agglomeration of different economic activities in different regions of the world. International trade
thus creates a kind of “pecking order” among nations, and as in a game of “musical chairs,” some
countries must be excluded from being rich.

5Although the factor mobility plays no role in creating the cross-country
differences
in this model, introducing a mobile factor might be an interesting
extension
of the model.
For example,
suppose that there are two factors,
immobile
labor L, and mobile capital K, which jointly forms a “generalized
factor, ” Z = F(K,L).
If the restriction of capital mobility is imposed, then the
present model can be directly applied by reinterpreted
by replacing
L by Z.
Then, if we allow capital to mover then capital flows from the Poor to the Rich,
which offers an answer to the question posed by Lucas (1990) . And the resulting
capital outflow magnifies the wage difference across the two regions.

One can modify the model, such as adding monopolistic

tradeable goods, so that there exist some benefits of trading in a
larger world.
Then, when countries became Poorer in the union, they have an
incentive to drop out of the union, because, if they had to be poorer, they would
