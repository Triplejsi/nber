August 1996
SOCIAL POLICY DIMENSIONS OF
ECONOMIC INTEGRATION:
ENVIRONMENTAL AND LABOUR
STANDARDS
ABSTRACT

Social policies, particularly environmental and labour issues, are not new to trade policy fora
including

the GATT.

However, they are likely to have a more prominent role in trade policy

discussions in the years ahead for the new World Trade Organization.

Many developing countries

perceive the entwining of these social issues with trade policy as a threat to both their sovereignty
and their economies, while significant groups in advanced economies consider it unfair, ecologically
unsound, even immoral to trade with countries adopting much lower standards than theirs,
This paper examines why these issues are becoming more prominent, whether the WTO is
an appropriate forum to discuss them, and how they affect developing and other economies.

It

concludes that (a) the direct effect on developing economies is likely to be small and for some may
even be positive through improved terms of trade and/or compensatory

transfer payments, but (b)

there is an important indirect negative effect on them and other economies, namely, the potential
erosion of the rules-based multilateral trading system that would result from an over-use of trade
measures to pursue environmental

or labour market objectives.

in natural resource and environmental

policies, in animal welfare issues, in education and

and so on. Some countries have sought to use trade policy as a stick or carrot to induce
other countries

to adopt something

closer to their social policy standards.

The United

States, for example, routinely does this in its dealings with China over human rights. It
has also used trade policy with Mexico in pursuit of animal welfare (the famous dolphintuna case), and with Vietnam in pursuit of the interests of US families of missing-inaction soldiers.

So, with sufficient fora yet to be fully developed for multilateral environmental

dialogue,

and with the problems increasingly being perceived as urgent as new scientific evidence
becomes available, there is a growing interest among environmental

groups -- especially

in the more advanced economies -- in using one of the few policy instruments

On the second, with respect to international

of trade measures is that they can be used effectively as sticks or carrots because they are

As espoused

by Krueger

(1977) and Learner (1987), this theory suggests that when a developing country opens up
to international

trade, its exports initially will be specialized in primary products. This is

because its stocks of produced capital relative to natural resources are comparatively

low.

16
It was because of this latter fact that trade policy first entered the environmental

The International

has been writing labour standards for 75 years.

Why has this issue suddenly become entangled with the GA~/WTO

head mainly when the trading system is in the news and particularly if labour markets are
in trouble at the time. It became an issue when the International

However, since the entwining of these social issues with trade policy is more likely to
tighten than to disentangle in the forseeable future, the question arises as to how
developing countries and forums such as APEC ought to respond. One response is to
point out that industrial countries had lower standards at earlier stages of their
development

and that, since developing countries have contributed a disproportionately

small amount per capita to global environmental
they should be compensated

rather than a stick. Likewise, if developing countries were seen to be enforcing reasonable
standards especially effectively on their foreign investors, concerns about capital outflows

A more controversial

suggestion has been made by Rodrik (1994). He believes a case can

in the ‘fairness’ of the trading system may ultimately be more costly to the

world economy than the action against the offending trading partner. He suggests that the
of the Uruguay Round could be broadened

to allow a ‘Social

Safeguards

Agreement

Safeguards’

clause whereby in such cases a country could restrict the offending imports

40

and compensate

the trading partner. Rodrik recognises that this could do more harm than

good (not least because

it would formalize

a link between

trade policy and social

standards). Even so, he argues that its merits need to be weighed against the other options
available

to developing

countries

to minimize

the damage from the encroachment

of

social issues into the trade policy domain. The sobering history of abuse of the GATT’s
other safeguards clauses, though (see Finger 1995), leaves little room for enthusiasm

for

this proposal to amend the Uruguay Round’s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing
Measures.

Beckerman (1992) notes that the cumulative world consumption

of the period, yet

today’s revised ‘known reserves’ nevertheless exceed those of twenty five years ago! The

Radetzki (1992), Grossman and Krueger ( 1993, 1995), Seldon and Song (1994), and
Grossman (1995). See also Deacon and Shapiro (1975) on the correlation between income
levels and voter attitudes toward environmental

priorities. Studies aimed at explaining

this transition (sometimes called an environmental

Kuznets curve) are now beginning to

emerge. Beltratti (1995) seeks to explain it in terms of transitional dynamics of
endogenous

growth models, while Jones and Manuelli (1995) provide a positive political

10The ban on ivory trade again provides a case in point. By lowering the value of elephant
products, the ban reduces the incentive for rural Africans to tolerate elephants trampling
their crops and so ultimately could result in more rather than less culling of elephants in
some areas. In other areas, the ivory trade ban has reduced the value of the animal so
