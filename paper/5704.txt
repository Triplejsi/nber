INEQUALITY, PREDATION AND WELFARE
ABSTRACT

This paper studies the relation between inequality and welfare in a general-equilibrium
in which people can choose to be either producers or predators.
privileged)

model

We assume that some people (the

are well endowed with human capital and other people (the unprivileged)

are poorly

endowed with human capital.
We analyze how the choice of the privileged between deterring and tolerating predation by
the unprivileged

depends on the interpersonal distribution of human capital.

number of people who are unprivileged

We find that, if the

is large, but a privileged person does not have too much

human capital relative to an unprivileged person, then the privileged allocate enough time and effort
to guarding against predation to deter the unprivileged
privileged tolerate predation by the unprivileged.

from being predators.

Otherwise,

the

Interestingly, a distribution of human capital that

is more egalitarian in that the number of people who are unprivileged is smaller can result in the
privileged choosing to tolerate rather than to deter predation by the unprivileged.
Next, we partition the feasible distributions of human capital into a set of Pareto efficient
distributions

and a set of Pareto inefficient distributions.

Interestingly, we find that if the average

endowment of human capital is large, then the fully egalitarian distribution is not Pareto efficient.
Instead, Pareto efficiency implies an unegalitarian

distribution

of human capital in which each

unprivileged person has only the endowment of human capital with which he was born. In addition,
this unegalitarian distribution satisfies the Rawlsian criterion of maximizing the consumption of the
unprivileged.

With this unegalitarian distribution the privileged choose to tolerate predation by the

unprivileged,

and predation results in maximum consumption for everyone.
