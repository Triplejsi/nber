Introduction
Why do countries trade? What determines the pattern of trade? It is difficult to conceive of

more fundamental problems for international trade economists. Two broad theones of international
trade patterns have been devised. One is comparative advantage and the other is increasing returns.
In reviewing the empirics of new trade thm~,

Krugman asks:

“How much of world trade is explained by increasing returns as opposed to comparative
advantage? That may not be a question with a precise answer. What is quite clear is that if
a precise answer is possible, we do not know it ,“ (1994, p. 23).
This is a d~ply unsatisftiory

state. Our paper will make progress in two directions. The first is that

tests designed to distinguish a trading world of increasing returns fi-om one of

comparative advantage. The second is that we estimate the relative contribution
explanato~

of each to the

power of our model.

While our model is of a trading world, the direct object of estimation is the structure of
manufacturing

production in the OECD, We chose this focus as it is commonly argued that it is

precisely there that increasing returns plays its most important role. Thus this provides the most
promising setting for identi&ng the effects of increasing returns,
Of course, comparative advantage and increasing returns represent two classes of trade
models. To make progress on the question, one is forced to select a model to represent each class.

advantage we will rely on a variant of the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek

a fundamental divide within these

models. On one side is the set of zero transport cost models surveyed in Helpman and Krugman
(1985). We do not pursue this avenue since, as we argue below, it is difficult to identifi features of
production or trade structure that distinguish these models from a variety of comparative advantage

2
models. The second set interacts increasing returns with transport costs to create what Krugman
(1991) has dubbed models of “economic geography.”
Even the ltier represents a set of models, rather than a specific alternative. In selecting among
the set of potential representative models for ~onornic geography, we had three aims in mind. First,
we wanted it to be a model that has f-tured

prominently in discussions of the role of increasing

returns in trade. Second, we needed its central theoretical result to be robust to the departures
required to take a theory from blackboard to data. Finally, we needed it to present a clear contrast
in its predictions relative to those of comparative advantage theories. These criteria yield a clear
candidate, drawn horn the classic paper of Krugman (1980).1 This model features what has long been
termed the “home market effect .“ This element of economic geography is then nested with a
Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek

model to ready it for empirical tests.

Our empirical results do not support the idea that this model of increasing returns contributes
to an understanding of the structure of OECD manufacturing. One specification of our model does
provide a glimmer of hope of finding these home market effects. However, the result is not robust
to inclusion of endowments as explanato~ variables at a 6ne level of production structure. Moreover,
even in the s@ution

most favorable to economic geography, the home market effects are of very

muted importance in understanding

OECD production. Of the explainable variance, 90 per cent is

accounted for by differences in factor endowments, and but 10 per cent by economic geography.

1It should be emphasized that this is one model of economic geography, and so camot
represent the fill breadth of this work. Nonetheless, it is a particularly prominent and influential
version. For a broader cross-section of the theory, see Krugman (199 1). Our focus on this model
was strongly itiuenced by its amenability to empirical implementation on cross country data.

3

Our results do not provide a complete answer to Krugman’s

question of the relative

irnwtt.ante of mmparative advantage and increasing returns for trade. The first reason is simply that
our dependent variable is not trade but production. The second reason is that we have examined ordy
one incr-g

returns mode~ and this with a variety of strong identi~ing assumptions. Nonetheless,

the absenm of a significant wntribution by increasing returns in explaining the OECD manufacturing
production structure should be troubling for those who believe that increasing returns are pervasive
there. And the excellent ability of the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek

framework to account for that

structure is very promising for the comparative advantage theories,

Increasing Returns and Comparative Advantage:
Separating the Models
2.1

Theory

In the last fifieen years, the analysis of international trade has undergone what Krugman
(1990) describes as a “quiet revolution.” This denotes the challenge of theories based on increasing
returns

to scale to the previously dominant paradigm of trade relations, that of comparative

advantage.
From the start, the increasing returns theory has promised to account for a number of
important observed phenomem that had ~rned

ptig

based on models of comparative advantage.

It offered a simple account of intraindustry trade, the simultaneous import and export of goods of
similar factor intensity. It promised to help us understand why so much of world trade is among
wuntries with relatively similar endowment proportions, apparently at odds with the Heckscher-Ohlin
theory. And it promised to provide a transparent theoretical underpinning for the gravity model,

4
perhaps the empirical trade model with the greatest success. Each of these has been held up as an
important advantage of the increasing returns models over those based on comparative advantage [see
Helpman and Krugman (1985)].
These claims have bwn questioned, both theoretically and empirically. Work by Chipman
(1992), Davis (1995, 1996), and Deardorff (1995) challenges the theoretical

how each of these observations can arise quite naturally in a world of comparative advantage. This

technical differences,

Rybczynski-like

The sense of this is appreciated by considering the

simplest monopolistic competition trade models: what role does increasing returns play, apart from
specialization, in giving rise to the characteristic trade patterns? The answer is none. In effect, the
recent theoretical work demonstrates

that the simple increasing returns models are observationally

to a variety of models based on comparative

advantage featuring a high degree of

specialization. 2

fact, this is exactly what one might expect from models such as that ofHelpman(198 1), where
Heckscher-Ohlin explains the broad industrial structure and increasing returns accounts for
intraindustry exchange.

5
returns theory with the more Wltional

models, was a milestone in winning broad acceptance for the

new work. Yet the integration of the theories is now so complete that there seem to be no empirical
elements that can separate them. If this were the end of the story, one would have to be profoundly
disappointed that a theo~ with such apparently revolutionary implications has come to so little. Yet
we believe that this dejection is unwarranted.
We have to agree with Krureturns framework

(1991) that the truly revolutionary element in the increasing

lies in the work which he has dubbed the new “economic geography.”

The

distinctive element of this work is the interaction of increasing returns with transport costs across
countries (or regions).3 In such a world, a fundamental contrast emerges with respect to models of
comparative advantage. This concerns the role of demand in determining trade patterns, In a model
of comparative advantage, ceteris puribus, unusually strong demand for a class of goods will turn
those goods into i.mportables. Transport wsts may diminish the trade volume, but will never lead the
good to be exported. This result dfiers importantly with that which emerges in a world of increasing
returns. The scale economies lead producers of individual goods to concentrate their production in
a single location. If a count~

has an unusually strong demand for a class of goods, that country

becomes a good choice as a site for production, and so it is likely to export the goods in question.
[See Krugman (1980)]
International transport costs play a crucial role herein allowing us to separate comparative
advantage from increasing returns. Yet we know that shipping and communications

costs have fallen

sharply in recent decades. Nonetheless, we would assert that costs of trading between nations may

per-unit rests that exist for transactions between but not within countries.

6
yet substantially ex~

that of trade within nations. Important evidence of this appears in McCallum

(1995), which shows that the international border matters a great deal, as seen in the contrast between
the volume of Canadian inter-provincial trade versus trade with similwly distant US states. We believe
that this justifies our focus on an increasing returns model with transport costs.
In sum, when there are costs of trade, unusually strong demand for a good yields opposing
predictions

in a comparative advantage vs. an increasing returns world. Comparative

advantage

suggests you will import that good; increasing returns suggests that you will export it. It is this basic
contrast that we will exploit to separate the models in our empirical work.

2.2

Empirics

Are increasing returns empirically important for explaining trade patterns? A natural first
approach to answering this quaion
@

is to ask whether they are of measurable importance at the plant,

and industry level. This has been a major empirical research question in industrial organization.

The literature has tended to reject the idea that economies of scale are crucial for industrial market
structure, with the exception of electrical power, telecommunications,
transportation

and products with very high

costs. [See excellent sumeys in Jorgenson (1986) and Scherer and Ross (1990)].

However this direct evidence is in any case unlikely to settle the issue of the importance of
scale anomies

for understanding trade patterns. From a theoretical perspective, it is the existence
of scale rather than their degree that is crucial in determining trade patterns. The results

could be driven by economies of scale too small to be detected by
Even if there are no economies of scale at the indust~ level, or economies

of scope at the firm level, small economies at the level of the individual product suffice for the

7
tharetical

framework. On the other hand, if the alternative hypothesis is a world of constant returns

to scale, the ti
dir=

that any error bounds will always include a region of increasing returns means that

evidenw in principal cannot refite the increasing returns hypothesis. Finally, even if one were

convinced that increasing returns is important at some levels, it does not follow that it matters for
trade patterns. For example, if average cost curves declined over some region, so that constant
returns to scale is literally incorrect, they may yet become flat or U-shaped at a level of output small
enough to admit entrants that lead us to a competitive world. In effect, direct evidence on scale
economies is urdikely to be decisive in settling their importance for trade patterns.
This suggests looking for the effms of de

anomies

in terms of their implications for trade

patterns. A voluminous literature has sought to do this by examining the way that a variety of proxies
for scale economies help to account for intraindustry trade. Our discussion of the theory above
suggests that such studies camot provide evidence that helps us to separate the theories, 4 As well,
an uncertain match between the theoretical categories and the division of industries in the data
provides additional cautions to this line of inquiry.s
Another effort to cordirm the importance of scale economies in giving rise to trade has
mncemed the volume of bdateral trade. Again, we have outlined above the theoretical objections to
using evidence on bilateral trade volumes as a way to separate increasing returns and comparative

4 For example, Harrigan (1994) notes that “A major difficulty in interpreting statistical
models to explain the Grubel-Lloyd [intraindustty trade] indices is that the monopolistic
competition model has very little to say about the cross-country and cross-industry variability of
the Grubel-Lloyd index.”
SBased on such considerations, Krugman (1 994, p. 19) concluded: “Conceptually, then,
the data on intra-industry trade area very ambiguous tool for investigating economies of scale and
trade,” See also Davis and Bhagwati (1995).

8
advantage theories, Here we take the studies on their own terms, Relatively simple gravity models
have long been known to do a good job of accounting for the volume of bilateral trade. Helpman
(1988) employed a variant of a gravity model based on an underlying monopolistic
*work

competition

to examine time series data for fourteen industrial countries. Generally the model worked

well, and Helpman viewed the results as evidence in favor of the scale economies framework.
Hurnmels and~hn(1995)

approached these results with a clever twist. They applied a variant

of Helpman’s approach to a data set consisting mostly of developing countries for which the
monopolistic

competition model was ex ante not expected to work. Their results showed that the

model “worked”

almost as well as in the study of Helpman. Evidently something more than just

increasing returns was at work.
Only a few years ago, chastisement of the increasing returns account of trade patterns for a
paucity

of empirical support would have been tendencious. Mer

comparative

all, empirical work on the

advantage theories hardly inspired confidence. The studies of Leontief (1953), and

Bowe~ Learner, and Sveikauskas (1987), suggested deep problems. Yet the last several years have
witnessed a revival of empirical work on comparative advantage. This includes the work of Trefler
(1993, 1996), Davis, Weinstein, et al. (1996), Brecher and Choudhri (1993), and Harrigan (1996).
To be sure, all of these have departed from the simplest factor price equalization

models of

Samuel son and Vanek. Yet the deviations have been very simple, and in the spirit of traditional
wmparative advantage, such as Ricardian technical differences, failures of factor price equalization,
and consideration of cross-count~

differences in demand patterns. And they have shown that with

sensible alterations, the simple comparative advantage models seem to do quite well.

There are no prior tests for a ve~ good reason. To be empirically implementable, a complete
anornic

geography theory must allow for increasing returns and transport costs. It must allow for

many countries, and for these to vary in endowment proportions,

economic size, and demand

patterns. Finally, it must allow for differences across industries in input proportions

and size. Yet,

there is no theoretical model that incorporates all of these elements. We do not filly remedy this
shortmrning – our aim is more modest. We propose to explore these variations separately to reveal
the logic governing production patterns. Where necessary, we are willing to make strong maintained
assumptions on the structure of the technology. And then -- cognizant of the potential pitfalls -- we
wills-

an estimating equation that embodies what we view as the robust core of these models,

We believe that the necessity to initiate empirical work that places these elements in a common
framework justifies the approach we take.
Our tharetica.1

work proceeds in two broad stages. The first is to explore the role of

idiosyncratic elements of demand in determining production patterns both in models of economic

10
geography and comparative advantage. We then proceed to show how to nest the two frameworks
in a mmer

amenable to empirical testing.

3.2

Economic Geography and the Home Market Effect

In this sectiom we employ a model of =nomic

geography to develop a number of results that

form the foundation for our empirical work. The model draws strongly on the pioneering paper of
Krugman (1 980). We summarize one elaboration of this framework due to Weder (1995). And we
extend the basic model to check the robustness of the results for problems that become important
when we turn to empirical implementation.
The model is developed with very strong symmetry conditions that provide a basis for factor
price equalization. Consider a world of two countries endowed in equal amounts with the single
factor labor, so that L = L*. In this world, there are two monopolistically

competitive industries,

indexed by X, and X2 Production of a variety in either indust~ takes place under increasing returns
to scale with identical production finctions across both varieties and industries, The labor usage in
the production

of an individual good j is given as F = a + b N, for g = 1, 2. The aggregate labor

constraint, for example in the home country, requires L = Zg F.
There are two types of mnsumers in the world, those who consume only good X,, and those
who consume only good X2 A key assumption of the model is that the former type are more
prevalent in the home country, and the latter in the foreign country -- in fact that the two are mirror
images. Atypical consumer with a preference for the type Xl goods will maximize a utility finction
of the Dixit-Stiglitz kind, Max V = [Zg ,x, D ~ P]i’psubject to the available labor income.

11
An extremely mnvenient f~ture of Krugman’s model is that even in the presence of transport
costs output per firm in equilibrium is at the same level in each of the countries. Along with the
symmetries in demand and productio~ this implies that the production patterns of the two countries
can be filly described by the number of varieties produced in each of the industries. Let P be the
number of varieties of good g produced at Home relative to those produced abroad. Let 0<1

be the

ratio of demand for a typical import relative to a domestically produced variety. Let 2 represent the
ratio of demanders for good g at Home relative to the number in Foreign. Krugman shows that in the
range of incomplete specialization, the relative production levels p can be described as:
~=

A-u
1-AU

When 2 = / demand patterns are identical and the countries produce the same number of varieties
in each industry, leaving a zero net balance. This will play an important role when we turn to our
empirical implementation

as it suggests that predictions of production structure, ceteris paribus,

should be centered around an even distribution of the industries across the countries. Idiosyncratic
demand components will then explain deviations from this neutral production structure.
Mormver, we need to consider closely the way in which idiosyncratic demand components
will translate into alterations in production structure. From above, and for the range of incomplete
specialization for which these relations are valid,

Krugman emphasized that this will imply that countries with a large “home market” for a good will
be net exporters of that good. For our purposes it is convenient to focus directly on the implications

12
for production. That is, idiosyncratic demand patterns (indexed by A) have a magnified impact on
production patterns. This will play a crucial role in our empirical implementation, helping to separate
the influences of economic geography from that of comparative advantage. These relations appear
in Figure 1 in schematic form.

Demand Idiosyncrasies have a Magnified
Impact on Production

Krugman (1980) briefly considers a case in which the countries differ not ordy in demand
patterns, but also in population. One version of this case is considered at length in Weder (1995). In
the latter, the “mirror image” of the two countries is preserved in the sense that the share of
individuals of each type is exactly opposite for the two goods and countries. However it is also
assumed that one muntry is Imger, so may even have an absolutely larger demand for all varieties of
both goods.

13
Weder shows that there are in principle three influences on the pattern of production in his
model: relative wages, w/w*; relative count~ size, DL*; and relative spending patterns, Wx where
his the proportion of consumers of the X, good at home, and~is the corresponding proportion for
the foreign country. Weder shows that the first two iduences

in effect net out, His main result

appears as Proposition 3: “In the open-economy equilibrium, each country is a net exporter of that
group of differentiated goods where it has a comparative home-market advantage.” And a country
is said to have a comparative home-market

advantage just when it has a higher proportion

of

demanders of one type relative to the other.

❑ = Net Exports
Figure 2

Production Patterns when Country
Size Differs

Thus the wuntry with the relatively high share of X, demanders will be the net exporter of the
X, type goods. This remains true even when one country has an absolutely larger market for all
varieties in both industries. Ultimately, this is not surprising for an economist trained in the theo~ of

14
mmparative advantage. The aggregate resource constraint for each country is going to force some
ordering on the location of production, It is intuitively pleasing that this is decided, as above, by the
comparative strength of the demand patterns. This result is depicted schematically in Figure 2.
There are two other directions in which generalizations are warranted. The first is to consider
what happens when there are more than two industries. The mnd

is to consider what happens when

there are more than two countries, A brief acquaintance with the simpler cases of Krugman (1980)
and Weder (1995) will mnvince the reader that such extensions threaten to become mired in a dense
jumble of algebra. Hence we eschew brute force, Rather, we will seek to capitalize on the beauty of
Krugman’s symmetry assumptions to explore th~

problems. One element of this symmetry that will

be key to the results that we examine is the fact that it results in factor price equalization among
muntriw in spite of being separated by transport costs, facing different vectors of goods prices, and
having quite distinct production and consumption patterns.
We will now examine the problem of trade in the goods of more than two industries. We
approach this indirectly. Let there be two trading blocs isolated from each other, each bloc formed
of two countries. Each pair of countries is in a trading equilibrium similar to that of Krugman
described above (equal sti, etc.). There are only two differences. One is that the goods being traded
differ between the blocs. As before, the countries in Bloc One are trading in the industries X, and Xr
In Bloc Two, the muntries instead are trading in industries Y, and Yz,with their populations divided
between those who consume the respective goods. The second difference is that the strength of the
demand idiosyncrasies may vary across the two blocs. We assume that the demand differences are
greater with respect to Bloc Two goods. Now consider what would happen if each of the countries
in one bloc merged with one of the countries in the other bloc. This would have no implications for

15
the real anomy,

although there would now be recorded trade between the two enlarged countries

in all four goods. Assuming that there was initially incomplete specialization in both blocs, this will
continue
antries

to be true in the two erdarged countries. Because of the symmetry, the two enlarged
will have exactly opposite rankings in degree of demand specialization. The key result for

our purposes

is that the degree of production

specialization will be greater for the goods with

stronger demand specifllzation.
A sirnilw approach can be used to investigate trade patterns in a three country, three indust~
world. Let the industria be indexed by X,, X= and XY We will consider a case in which each country
has only two types of consumers: Country One has consumers who demand only goods from
industries Xl and Xz; Country Two has consumers who demand only goods from industries Xz and
X3; and CountV Three has has consumers who demand ordy goods from industries Xq and Xl.
Assume again that the countries are the same size, and that the proportion of the consumers that
demand the respective goods are j and (1 -~

in each country, with ~ > 1/2. It is clear from the

symmetry that the equilibrium will again feature factor price equalization. Moreover, given that the
cost conditions are unchanged, and the local demand conditions in the two markets that demand a
particular good are effectively the same as in the two country model, producers will face the same
tradaffs,

and so we will obsewe the same division of production between the markets with positive

demand. Thus while the move to more muntries makes the story marginally more intricate, the exact
same kind of home market effects can be obsewed in a world of many countries (and goods).

3.3

Production and Idiosyncratic Demand under Comparative Advantage

We have already examined the relation between patterns of idiosyncratic
production

in a model of economic geography. We now ansider

demand and

the same problem in models of

advantage. A usefi.d benchmark case is that with zero transport costs. For simplicity,

consider a conventional freely-trading Heckscher-Ohlin

world with two goods, X and Y, and two

factors, capital and labor (each consumer supplying a unit of labor). Assume that we meet the
mnventional requirements for factor price equalization. Let there also be two types of consumers -those who consume ordy X and those who consume ordy Y, Assume that the two types are initially
distributed uniformly across the muntries, Then trade patterns will be determined precisely according
to the standard Heckscher-Ohlin determinants of deviations from an average production pattern. Now
consider a redistribution of the mnsumer types across countries that leaves the aggregate labor force
in each unaffected. This will yield the same equilibrium relative goods price [see Dixit-Norman
(1980)], but the muntries now have an idiosyncratic component of demand. Our concern is whether
the idiosyncratic demand pattern affects production. It does not. The reason is that with a fixed
production

set, the equilibrium goods prices are sufficient to determine production structure. The

goods prices themselves depend on the structure of world demand (not directly its local component).
[See Figure Three]

The problem is ordy slightly more complicated when we consider a competitive world with
transport costs. Unfortunately,

once we introduce transport costs it is no longer simple to conduct

experiments that change the pattern of local demand while leaving world demand (so equilibrium
goods prices) uti@ed.

Thus we turn to a slightly different experiment, that of considering shocks

to the pattern of local demand (not compensated elsewhere). The intuition comes through simply

Idiosyncratic Demand in a Competitive World
with Transport Costs

Our problem now can be broken down into two parts. When the equilibrium price falls in the
range [~ a + r] there are no imports, For local demand shifts that leave the equilibrium price in this
range, all local demand (idiosyncratic or not) must be met by local production. Hence in this range,
production and demand move one-for-one. However the good is not traded. If instead we consider
a positive local demand shock that moves us between equilibria with trade, then there is a supply
response from each of the muntries. In fact, it is straightforward to see that in this simple case if the
equilibrium change in quantity is W, then only&

=W

of it will be met through increased local

19
supply. IfN is large (so that the typical country is relatively small amidst the aggregate), then the local
supply response at the margin will be close to zero.
We must ponder one final fillip. This is the case when the number of goods exceeds the
number of ftiors.

of freedom equal to the excess number of goods relative

to factors. Ceieris puribus, this implies that even small costs of trading some of the relevant goods
could M

the fill measure of trade onto the remaining goods. For the goods with positive costs of

trade, local production and absoprtion may move one-for-one, even if these costs of trade are small.
Our conclusio~

then, is that comparative

advantage can account for relations between

idiosyncratic demand and production that range from zero to one-to-one. The interpretations

vary,

though. The relation will be zero in the N-good, N-factor, frictionless trading world. In this same
world, but with transport mst~ there will be one range in which demand and production move one-to
one, and a region in which the relation is close to zero. Thus, the measured relation could be
anywhere between zero and one, depending on how the level of transport costs affects the weight that
should be placed on each of these regions. Finally, we saw that in a simple world in which the number
of goods exceeds the number of factors, it is possible that even small transport costs could lead
production and idiosyncratic demand to move one for one. In no case, though, would there ever be
a more than one-to-one relation in a comparative advantage world.

Nesting Heckscher-Ohlin

and Economic Geography

In this section, we turn to the problem of nesting the models in a framework that will be

However, production of goods within each of the industries is

determined according to the influences identiied in the models of economic geography above, Given
the output level, we can compute directly the commitment of resources to an industry by each
country. Countries differ in the scale of their industries but not in the factor composition within an
industry. These differences in industry size will play a key role as an aggregate resource constraint
that insures that it is the relative (not absolute) market sizes that matter for production patterns.

When we think about a single industry across wuntries, this mmes close to exactly mimicking
the simple monomic geography models. The presence of many factors is not a problem since the
fixed coefficients effectively turn the many into one composite factor. The level of resources
committed by each to the indust~ is fixed and works similarly to the fixed labor endowment in the
simpler models. The one important difference between this more complex setting and the simpler
mnomic

geography models is that the relevant factor prices are determined in a model broader than

the single four digit industry. Nonetheless, the fact that each country faces an aggregate resource
constraint specific to the industry (under our maintained assumption of fixed coefficients) strongly
suggests that relative demand will continue to figure prominently in the assignment of production of
specific goods across countries.

Empirical Implementation
4.1

Focalizing

the Hypotheses

Our formalization of the Hwkscher-Ohlin

production model is straightfo~ard

that of a long line of empirical trade papers [S-,

and mirrors

Learner and Levinsohn (1995)]. We start by

assuming that the location of production can be determined by factor endowments according to the
following formula:
X’QV

(1)

where X is a N x C matrix of output, V is a M x C matrix of factor endowments, and Q is a N x A4
matrix of parameters that in the case of equal numbers of goods and factors equals the inverse of the
Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek technology matrix. In our implementation of (l), N> A4, but following a long
tradition in empirical trade, we will assume that the number of goods in the real world equals the
number of factors and that missing factors are contained in the error term, Whether it is reasonable
to think of world production as being driven by ftior

endowments can then be assessed by examining

how well equation (1) fits the data.
Following our theoretical model, let’s assume that there are N= A4 industries that use factors
in different proportions

per unit output, and that technology is Leontief. Suppose that within an

industry n, there are Gn goods that are produced using factors in the same proportions but enter into
the utiity finction separately. Within an indust~ like textiles, these goods might correspond to spun
textiles, knit fabrics, carpets and rugs, etc. Since all of these goods are produced using the same
techniques, we can rewrite equation 1 as

23

x“.

(2)

:X--=Q”V
g=l

,

for all industries n and goods g. Here f? denotes the nth row of the D matrix. Our formulation allows
us to have a very special type of indeterminacy. While the aggregate output of industries is assumed
to be driven by ftior
be driven by f-or
literature, ftior

endowment% the output shares of goods within the indust~ is fisumed not to

endowments. In other words, to draw an example from the economic geography
endoments

may tell us something about which muntries are large textile producers,

but they may be very poor predictors of where goods like carpets are located.
Since a maintained assumption is that Heckscher-Ohlin

models of production camot explain

production patterns below a certain level of aggregation, we need a theory to explain the location of
production of goods within an industry, Let’s suppose that each good is comprised of a number of
varieties that are produced using increasing returns technology. To continue our example, we are
assuming

that within the industry “textiles” there is a good “carpets”

that is comprised

of

monopolistically mmpetitive varieties like “wall-to-waU carpets,” “Persian carpets,” “rugs,” etc., each
of which is produced with economies of scale. It is at the varieties level that we assume economies
of scale drives specialization.

This assumption

of specialization

for varieties at this level of

disaggregation seems reasonable in light of Grubel and Lloyd’s (1975) haling that at the SITC 5-digit
level, intraindustry trade ordy accounts for only 14% of all trade.
Empirically, the challenge is to determine whether the assumption that economies of scale
form the s~ialization

helps us understand production patterns at the goods level. Following Weder

(1995), we model goods production as

24

‘~w=i~xnc[:-$)xn

(3)

where D denotes absorption in either the country or the world and the first derivatives are expected
to be non-negative. The first term in~captures
relative ties

the tendency for each country to produce the same

of each good. Absent any demand differences, the share of production of any good g

in industry n should be approximately

equal to the share in the world, The second term mirrors

Weder’s rendition for tilng a net exporter of a wmmodity in a two muntry world where one country
diffws in Sk from the other. High relative demand for a good in one country causes more vaneties
to locate in that muntry and thus raises production of that good. In our specification we suggest that
this Wlght lirdcing relative demands in two countries should be expendable to comparisons between
one muntry and the rest of the world. This specification captures the notion that production should
locate in muntries with idiosyncratically high relative demands. Using the fact that world production
must equal world consumptio~

we can rewrite (3) as

to the first terms in a Taylor expansion and the emor corresponds to the higher

order terms. The structure that we have placed on the analysis enables us to directly test the
hypothesis of whether economic geography can improve our understanding of production patterns
at the 4-digit level relative to the alternative

hypothesis

that all production

at that level is

indeterminate.
A few more words are in order about the specification. If the absorption of goods within
countries is proportional

to world production

of goods (i.e. consumption

is homothetic),

then

SHARE will equal the average level of production of a sub-industry within a Heckscher-Ohlin
industry. In general, one should expect the coefficient on SHARE to be one.
We can now move to formal hypothesis testing. The coefficient on IDIODEM captures the
impact that idiosyncratic patterns of demand have on production. If we estimate equation (4’), we can
evaluate three hypotheses. First if PI is zero, then we conclude that we are in a world in which
transport

costs do not matter. As we have seen in the theoretical

section, however, even in a

comparative advantage world transportation costs can cause output to move as much as one for one
with demand. This is esp=ially true in cases where there are more goods than factors -- a maintained

26
assumption in our analysis.’ We can test this hypothesis by examining if fll is between zero and one.
If~l fds within this range, then we mnclude that we are in a world in which transportation
demand patterns affect the location of production

costs and

but there are no economies of scale driving

specialization. Finally, if ~1 exceeds one, then we conclude that the magnification or home market
effects associated with economies of scale are playing some role in driving production.

These

hypotheses are summarized below:

There is a probleq

however, with simply relying on estimates of equation (4’) to test

hypotheses. Remember that the maintained null hypothesis in all of these cases is that after industry
output is determined, factor endowments play no role in determining the location of production at
the goods level. An alternative approach would be assume that there are an equal number of goods
and ftiors

and test the specification outlined in equation (4’) against a specification that postulates

that ftior

endowments determine levels of production of goods within industries, i.e. we would like

to test the specification suggested by equation (4’) against the specification below:

industries equals the number of factors.

27
The specification test would then consist of estimating a nested model,

X~m=a~+~lSHAMgM+~JDIOD~gM

(4”)

and seeing if the coefficient on ~IODEM

+Q~Vc+E~ ,

was robust to the inclusion of factor endowments.

There is also one additional theoretical issue that we need to address at this stage. Since we
are considering a model with transport costs, even in a standard Heckscher-Ohlin

framework, the

FOB price is going to be lower than the CIF price. This implies that there may be a tendency for
domestic absorption to be higher if a muntry is a net exporter of a good because domestic consumers
pay the FOB price while mnsumers in muntries that import the good must pay the CIF price plus the
cost of transportation. In order words, absorption may mvq

with production because countries with

higher production levels are more likely to be net exporters of goods and therefore have lower prices,
One way to ~rrect for this problem is to include a dummy variable that is one if the country is a net
exporter of the good and zero otherwise. However, because the impact of this effect is likely to be
proportional to the size of demand, we created EXPORTD which is the interaction of a net export
dummy with domestic absorption.

4.2

Econometric Issues

Equations (2) and (4’) can be estimated separately or as a system of seemingly unrelated
regressions.

The main problem with estimating

each of the equations

separately

is missing

obsewations

at the 4-digit level. At the 3-digit level we have observations for each industry for 22

countries but at the 4-digit level we lose 9 countries. This greatly reduces the number of available

28
degrees of freedom especially in specifications where we would like to nest the two hypotheses. We
therefore

opted to estimate all of the equations both individually and as a system of seemingly

unrelated regressions where we imposed the restriction that the coefficients on the IDIODEM and
SHARE had to be the same across equations.”
There are a series of econometric issues, however, that prevent direct estimation of these
equations. First, in equation (4’) there is a simultaneity problem arising from the fact that X~= is an
element of ~.

This makes the estimated mf6cients

biased and inconsistent. However, if we assume

that Heckscher-Ohlin is valid at higher levels of aggregation, then theory provides us with a good set
of instruments. Namely, if we assume that equation (2) is valid, we can use factor endowments as
instruments for the sectoral level of output.
Second, we also must deal with two types of heteroskedasticity.

First, larger countries tend

to produce more of everything and therefore the errors are likely to be correlated with country size.
bnd,

when we estimate equations (4’) and (4”), there is an additional element of heteroskedasticity

that arises from the fact that industries that are larger are likely to have larger errors. We correct for
this heteroskedasticity

by assuming that errors across countries are determined by the following

stochastic process:

considerations also ford

industrim more than others bse

of the log form of the regressio~

we forced all industry standard

errors to equal one by dividing all observations by the heteroskedasticity

corrected standard errors

appropriate for that good.
Finally, one may wonder whether it is appropriate
dependent

to assume spherical errors when our

variable is bounded below at zero. This is not just an econometric

problem but a

theoretical problem too. If a country does not produce a particular good, it could indicate that the
country is no longer in the factor price equalization set and may be using different production
techniques.

Fortunately,

in our sample, all countries produced positive amounts at all levels of

disaggregatio~ so we f~l that our assumption regarding the normality of the disturbances probably
does not affect our results.

4.3

Data

Theory does not indicate how to find a level of disaggregation
_

where factor endowments

determining production structure and specialization is driven by increasing returns and demand

patterns. Our strategy was to use the most detailed cross-national data we could find and then assume
that industries at the most disaggregated levels were monopolistically competitive.
The data source most appropriate for our purposes was the OECD’S Comparative Trade and
Production

(COMTAP)

data set. This provides comparable trade and production

data for 13

30
members of the OECD at the 4-digit level and 22 members of the OECD at the 3-digit classification
level. These countries are listed in Table 1.
In principle, working at the 4digit level enabled us to break manufacturing up into 82 4-digit
sectors, but because in 13 cases there was ordy one 4-digit sector within a three digit sector, our
sample was reduced to 69 4-digit and 27 3-digit sectors. In addition, we had to drop another 134digit ~ors

due to missing observations for some countries. Domestic absorption was calculated by

subtracting net exports from production, In two sectors (fir dressing and dyeing and manufacturing
goods, not elsewhere classified), we obtained large negative numbers for domestic absorption for a
number of countries so we dropped those industries. For a few out of the remaining 897 obsewations,
imputed domestic absorption was negative but vety small (1 -2°/0 of production),

and we attributed

these negatives to measurement error and reclassified these amounts as zeros. Table 2 reports the 54
4-digit industries that we eventually used in the analysis. As one can see from the table, many of the
industries

at the 4-digit level, such as carpets and rugs and motor vehicles, have been used as

examples of monopolistically

competitive industries. Indeed this level of disaggregation

is basically

the same as the one used by Krugman (1991) to support his hypothesis that geography matters for
trade.
Because of data limitations we were forced to measure domestic absorption as a residual.
Measuring
through

domestic absorption by using a residual potentially introduces a bias into our sample

the mismeasurement

of production.

If production

is recorded at too high a level for a

particular year, that will also tend to cause measured absorption to rise. This creates a simultaneity
problem if we use contemporaneous

demand. Furthermore,

since the spirit of economic geography

models is to explore how long-inn historical demand deviations tiect

production,

we thought it

31
inappropriate to regress current production on current demand. In order to deal with both of these
issues, we decided to use average demand over the period 1970-1975 to identi~

idiosyncratic

mmponents of demand, while other variables in our regressions were values for 1985. We also ran
all speci.lications with demand dculated

over the time period 1976-1985 and just 1985 and obtained

results qualitatively the same.9
Table 3 presents some sample statistics on the data. The first panel presents a correlation
matrix of 4-digit output across our sample of countries. The striking f~ture of this table is that output
is always positively mrrelated tithin our sample of countries and sometimes the correlation between
wuntries is quite high. This table demonstrates the ofien expressed notion that OECD countries have
a broadly similar production structure. Indeed, this absence of substantial variation in the relative sizes
of sectors within countries is often viewed as a prima facie case against Heckscher-Ohlin,
Table 3 also reports sample statistics for our consumption variables. The data reveals that
there are typically four 4di@t =ors

within a 3-digit sector. Furthermore,

it appears that absorption

distortions are ftirly symmetrically distributed around zero in our sample.
Our data on ftior

endowments came from a number of sources. Country capital stocks were

Aculated by usiig a perpetual inventory method using investment and price data from Summers and
Heston (1988) and a depreciation rate of 0.133. The rate was chosen to be consistent with earlier
studies such as BoweL Learner, and Sveikauskas (1987) and Davis, Weinstein et. al. (1996). World
endowments of labor force by educational level were taken from the UNESCO Sfalistical Yearbook,

9 Avinash Dixit pointed out to us a second potential bias in favor of the geography model,
One can imagine a variety of reasons why local demand and production structure may positively
covary independent of the elements that define economic geography. This would tend to bias our
estimates of the home market effect upwards.

Statistics Yearbook,

Estimating the Heckscher-Ohlin Production Model

We append an additive error term on the end of equation (2) in order to estimate the
Heckscher-Ohlin
section of ftior

production

equation. Although many authors have regressed trade on a cross

endowments, it is worth noting that as fw as we know, no one has directly estimated

equation (2) across countries. The closest work in this spirit is that of Harrigan (1995). Harrigan
decided not to estimate 2 directly because he was concerned that with 20 countries and 4 factors (in
our case we will use 22 countries and 5 factors), he would not have many degrees of freedom.
Mq

he estimated equation (2) using time series data with a constant term for each industry and

a procedure

that allowed the coefficients to vary somewhat over time. Although the time series

estimates all had R2 in excess of 0.9, when he compared the relative magnitudes of the fitted values
to the actual outputs, Harrigan found very large predictive errors. In other words, his estimates were
largely driven by the time series variation, but had little to say about the between variation. Harrigan
therefore concluded that “the ~eckscher-Otdin]

model does not do a particularly good job at

explaining cross-country variation in output.”
The results were not promising for the Heckscher-Ohlin
~cult

to ~

model, but, as Harngan noted, it is

whether the ftiure was due to a failure of the theory or simply in the way in which

f? was allowed to vary over time. Consider the following problem. Suppose productivity or price
changes causes the technology matrix to move according to some well-behaved pattern, how would
those changes appear in the ~matnx?

Since the elements of the Omatrix are going to be a complex

33
non-linear transformation

of the elements of the technology matrix, it would be very surprising if

movements in the Owere also well behaved. We therefore should not be surprised if it is difficult to
characterize movements in Q over time.
Since rigorous application of the theory requires cross-sectional

estimatio~

this is the path

we will follow. Even so, we must bear in mind that the theory may fail an F-test and the regression
may have a low adjusted R2 because we are working with few degrees of freedom.
Table 4 presents the results of estimating equation (2) using 3-digit output data. Overall,
output seems to be highly correlated with factor endowments with R2 that are on average 0.90 and
in most regressions the coefficients of several of the factors have significant t-statistics indicating that
the tifficients

can be measured with a reasonable amount of precision. We find the good fits of these

regressions quite surprising, especially in light of Harrigan’s results. Our results clearly suggest that
production patterns are actually extremely highly correlated with factor endowments.
We do not report the coefficients because, beyond their sign, their values are dependent on
both the sti of the sector and the units used to measure the factor endowments. This makes it very
difficult to interpret magnitudes,

The coefficient on capital is almost always significant, which

indicates that aggregate capital stocks play an important role in the level of manufacturing activity.
There does not seem to be much of a pattern to the estimates of the other coefficients, At first glance,
this might appear troubling but a bit more thought suggests that one should not be concerned. First,
even if we ~pt

the strong maintained assumption that there are an equal number of industries and

factors and hence that our coefficients are Rybczynski derivatives, the coefficients we estimated
correspond to elements in the inverse of a twhnology matrix with a dimension of around thirty. Since
it is impossible to infer the coefficients of a high dimension technology matrix from parts of its

34
inverse, we f~l that the coefficients cannot be interpreted. Second, if there are more industries than
ftiors,

then despite the indeterminacy of the system, it still maybe the case that production patterns

are correlated with factor endowments,

but the coefficients will not necessarily correspond

to

technological parameters.
These production results are somewhat better than the results that typically obtain when net
trade flows are regressed on factor endowments. Learner (1 984), for example, used ten factors and
ten industries and obtained an average R2 of 0.64 on 1975 data. One possible reason for our better
fit is that in this sample we have restricted ourselves to ordy looking at the OECD while other
authors,

e.g. Learner (1984),

have typically used much broader

assumptions of the Heckscher-Ohlin

samples of countries.

Core

model such as identical technologies, factor price equalization,

and the absence of barriers to trade are likely to be much closer to the truth for the OECD than for
developing countries. Second, it may also be the case that factor endowments predict output better
than consumption,

causing the production side of the model to work better than the consumption

side. Hunter and Markusen (1989) and Hunter (1991) have shown that non-homothetic
may bean irnpo-t
pronoud

ftior

preferences

in explaining trade flows. Since d~erences in income are likely to be more

in samples that include both the OECD and developing countries, it is possible that the

relatively poorer fit in previous studies of trade are due to consumption distortions across countries
with very different per capita incomes. On the other hand, the fact that Heckscher-OMin

is ofien

thought to explain North-South trade more than North-North trade because of the greater differences
in factor endowments
second argument.

between developed and developing countries tends to run counter to this

35
Oddly enough, the more troubling fmture of these results is the very high R2. We did not
exp

the HO model to fit cross-sectional data for the OECD this well. The most obvious candidate

for a spurious correlation is country size. Our data contains two sorts of variation. The first type of
variation is due solely to size factors. Suppose two countries have identical factor proportions,

but

one country is simply larger than the other. In this case one might obtain very good fits of a
regression of output on factor endowments

bwause factor endowments

are simply a proxy for

muntty size and country size is proportional to output in each sector. The second type of variation
arises solely from ftior

proportion d~erences. If two countries had the same GDP but differed only

in their relative endowments, it also should be possible to predict output patterns knowing factor
endowments. While theoretidy

both sources of variation should be related in the same way to factor

endowments, it would be troubling if size were the ordy factor driving our results. Indeed, looking
at the bgh correlations of output at the 4-digit level revealed in Table 3, it seems plausible that the
first explanation could be driving our results.
Fortunately, this potential problem can be easily resolved. All of the size based variation can
be eliminated by forcing 0 to equal 2 in our heteroskAicity

correction. This deflates all output and

factors by GDP and eliminates all of the size based variation leaving us with only the factor
proportion based variation. Table 4A reports the results of indust~ by industry estimation making
this mrrection.

As one might suspect, the size based variation did tend to increase our R2’s, but not

by that much, On average, our adjusted R*’s averaged 0.7, which is still quite respectable, We
therefore conclude that even when looking only at the purely compositional component of output
variatio~ factors endowments explain a very large share of output within the OECD,

36

4.5

Testing for the Home Market Effect

The relationships that we ~k

to test can be portrayed graphically, and it makes sense to look

at the data before plunging into the econometrics. Obviously, it is impossible to display a multivariate
relationship

in a bivariate graph but we can obtain some sense of the data through the following

exercise. If we divide both sides of equation (4’) by X and then set fll equal to 1 and bring the share
term over to the left-hand-side, we obtain

The left-hand-side

represents how much the share of a given 4-digit indust~

deviates relative to

world levels while the term in parentheses tells us of the magnitude of the idiosyncratic demand
distortion. Figure 6 presents the results of graphing the Iefi-hand-side of the above equation against
the term in parentheses. Plotting the data in this manner enables us to visually examine the various
hypotheses that we have been considering. If transportation

costs were zero and production was

CRS, one would expect to see a scatter of points lying along the horizontal line through zero. In this
case, demand distortions would have no impact on production distortions. If the world is CRS but
there are transportation rests one would expect the scatter of points to lie somewhere in between the
450 degree line and the horizontal line through zero. Finally, in the world of economic geography,

one would expect the points to be scattered along a line with a slope larger than 1 because
idiosyncratic demand patterns should have magnified effects on production. The data clearly reject
the hypothesis that we are in a frictionless comparative advantage world, The two series are highly

This seems to suggest that either a weak home market effect or indeterminacy are apparent in these
data, We also experimented by plotting the same variables for 2 and 3-digit industries instead of 3 and
4-digit ones. The results displayed in Figure 7 seem to lend support to the view that, at least at this
level of aggregatio~

mnomic

geography eff~s

do not seem important.

Regression analysis mrdirms the general imprtion

of the data we obtained in Figure 6. Table

6 presents the results of estimating equation 5 under a variety of specifications.

In the first panel, we

estimate aversion of the model in which ordy geography effects are allowed to operate at the 4-digit
level. In this specificatio~ the ~flicient

on IDIODEM is precisely measured and significantly larger

than one, indicating that historical idiosyncratic demand patterns are associated with even larger
fiture production shares. In other words, at the mea~ a country that had idiosyncratic demand that
was lW!O larger than the world share of a given 4di@t good will see its production of that good rise
120Y0. It is also comforting to note that the coefficient on SHARE is close to one, as one would
expect.
We were wncemed that this might be the result of FOB prices being lower than CIF prices,
so we corrected for this by adding EXPORTD. While the results indicate that being a net exporter
is highly correlated with production, it had almost no impact on any of the other point estimates in
the regressions.

This suggests that our results are not being driven by the fact that countries that

produce a lot tend to have lower prices and therefore consume more.

against a null speci&ng
However,

that factor endowments matter at the 3-digit, but not the 4-digit level.

there is reason to suspect that our results may be driven by an omitted variables bias.

Suppose that one’s view of the world was that factor endowments mattered at the 4-digit level, i.e.
that equation (2’), not equation (2), was the true description of international production. If this were
the case, absorptio~
ftior

which contains the demand for intermediate inputs, might be correlated with

endowments because industrial production (and hence industrial demand for inputs) would be

driven by factor endowments,
comparative

Suppose, for example, the same factors that give countries

a

advantage in automobile production also give them a comparative advantage in steel

production.

If we then regressed steel production on steel absorption we would obtain a spurious

acceptance of economic geography because the same factors that caused the automobile sector to
expand, and therefore demand more steel, would also generate a comparative advantage in steel
production.
Clearly a s~fication
f-h

test of the type described by equation (4”) is warranted. The third and

columns of Table 6 perform this experiment. Adding factor endowments to the model causes

the point estimate for the tifficient

on IDIODEM to drop below one and the coefficient on SHARE

becomes insignificant. In other wor&, we can formally reject a model of economic geography in
fmor of a comparative &ntage
that a model of mnomic

mdl

with transport costs. We believe that this is the first time

geography has ever &n rejected by international data using a theoretically

rigorous test.
Several caveats are in order. Even in this more general specification, the coefficient on
IDIODEM

is still much larger than zero. Within the context of the hypothesis tests that we have

39
constructed,

our interpretation is either that transpofiation

costs matter or that economies of scale

are only present in a subset of OECD manufacturing. There is reason for concern about whether
transpoti costs, which are usually measured to be relatively small, could cause production to rise by
70?? as much as idiosyncratic demand. In defense of this estimate, we need to remember that if factor
endowments matter, but there still is some indetetinacy
then it is not su~rising to see this sort of mrrelation.
apparently small tiers

in production patterns at the 4-digit level,

Indeed, McCallum (1995) has found that even

at the border have tremendous impacts on trade flows between the US and

Canada,
In considering these results, it is usefil to consider one final twist. Krugman (1980) also
develops a model with transport costs and two countries, one large and one small, The twist is that
he allows for a mix of industries, one subject to increasing and the other to constant returns to scale.
His conclusion was that even if the entire increasing returns to scale industry could fitinto the smaller
count~,

there would be a tendency for this industry instead to locate in the larger country because

of the improved market access. That is, when there are a mix of constant and increasing returns
sectors, and in contrast to the results of Weder, absolute -- not only relative -- market size may
matter.
In applying

this insight to our results, one must pay carefil

attention to the level of

aggregation that is being considered. If some (3-digit) industries are increasing and others constant
returns to scale, then the coefficient on IDIODEM

pooled across industries does not have the

structural interpretation that we have given it. Nevertheless, our use of the Weder framework based
on relative demand will continue to hold exactly for those industries featuring increasing returns. The

40
reason is that our assumption of Leontief technologies has made the resource constraints industryspecific. This suggests looking at coefficients on individual industry runs.
In order to see if there was a pattern to the magnitudes of the coefficients, we reran equation
(4”) with tier

endowments separately for each industry. The lack of degrees of freedom meant that

it was difficult to obtain precise estimates of the coefficients, but even so, as Table 7 demonstrates
we were able to reject a coefficient of zero in most industries. This suggests that in most industries
demand d~

have some role on the location of production. Unfortunately for economic geography,

however, we only obtained point estimates of larger than one in one third of the sample and could
reject a null of 1 for ordy 1 of 54 industries (one-sided t-test, 95°/0 cofidence

level). Of course, it

must be emphasized that the small number of degrees of freedom make it very difficult to see
statistical patterns in this type of analysis. Even if we expand our criteria to only look at industries
with point estimates larger than one, there does not seem to be a pattern to the industries that have
(insi@cant)

-fficients

larger than one and our priors about which industries are likely to exhibit

economies of scale.
There is a second way that a mix of increasing returns and constant returns sectors might
mmplitie

our analysis. If (3digit) industries are themselves a mix of (4-digit) goods, some of which

are constant and others increasing returns to scale, then even the coefficients on IDIODEM in the
individual industry runs fail to have the structural interpretation we have placed on them, In such a
case, the results of Krugman (1980) suggest that countries with absolutely small markets will tend
to concentrate
concentrate

on constant returns goods, while those with absolutely large markets will tend to

on increasing returns goods. A rough test of this can be devised based on our earlier

examination of output correlations. Since countries like the US and Japan are likely to have much

41
larger domestic markets than countries like Belgium and Holland, one would expect the increasing
returns industries to locate in large countries and constant returns industries in small countries. This
implies that we should see a negative correlation in industrial composition between large and small
auntries.

Howevti, Table 3 demonstrates that industrial imposition

ispsilively

correlated between

every country pair in our sample. This seems very hard to reconcile with absolute market size driving
international specialization.
In light of these results, we conclude that while we can detect a weak relationship that is
supportive of economic geography in certain specifications, it is not robust to the inclusion of factor
endowments. bnomic

geography does not appear to drive production in OECD manufacturing in

general, but, in the most generous interpretation of the dat~ geography may play some role in the
determination of production in as much as a third of all OECD manufacturing sectors. 11

there is another equally important

significance of the coef6cients, Harking back to Krugman’s initial

regarding the importance of increasing returns, we would like to know how sensitive

Our results also have implications for those who would use restrictive trade policy
as an instrument of industrial or export policy. Krugman (1984) has outlined a theoretical link
between protection of the home market and increased export penetration abroad, While
Krugman’s focus was on oligopolistic trade within a single market, others have been less carefil,
applying these ideas to broader industrial aggregates and even all of manufacturing. The practical
question is whether a larger home market (due either to demand idiosyncrasies or protection) will
be associated with increased exports. A necessa~ condition for this would be identification of
what we have termed the “magnification effect” of demand on production. Our failure to find this
effect strongly suggests that the “import protection as expott promotion” idea should not be
applied to these broad aggregates. It also raises an important question as to how prevalent such
effects are generally, even within OECD manufacturing.

To some degree, this experiment overstates the importance of economic geography because
much of the variance attributed to the SHARE term is really due to Heckscher-Ohlin

operating at the

3-digit level. If we attribute the explanatory power of SHARE to the Heckscher-Ohlin

model, we

obtain:

In other words, demand fluctuations only seem to account for around 10% of OECD production

Conclusion
This paper reports the first tests that nest the trade models of economic geography and

Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek

for estimation on international data. The particular model of economic

geography which we employ is based on Krugman (1980), and features the “home market” effect.
To test this, we select a setting ofien cited as f~turing

pervasive increasing returns -- i.e. one we

believed ex ante to be most propitious for finding the effects of economic geography, Accordingly,
our study fmuses on explaining the structure of manufacturing production across the OECD,
Our results provide little support for the economic geography model. We find that the
structure of OECD manufmring

production is best explained by a model which allows endowments

to determine

output at all levels. Some indication of

“home market” effects appears in the

specification

in which HOV determines output structure

at the 3-digit level, while economic

gmgraphy does w at the 4-digit level. However these results are not robust. Allowing endowments
to matter for production

at the 4-digit level eliminates the home market effect. Similarly, a

specification in which endowments determined output structure at the 2-digit level, while economic
geography determined output at the 3-digit level likewise fails to support the “home market” effect.
Moreover, even in the model most supportive of the presence of home market effects, the results
suggest that these are of relatively minor importance. Of the explainable variance, endowments
account for 90 per cent, and home market effects just 10 per cent. In sum, the big picture is that
