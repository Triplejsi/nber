SCHOOL RESOURCES AND STUDENT
OUTCOMES: AN OVERVIEW OF THE
Literature
AND NEW EVIDENCE FROM
NORTHANDSOUTH
CAROLINA

ABSTRACT

This paper reviews and interprets the literature on the effect of school resources on students’
eventual earnings and educational attainment. In addition, new evidence is presented on the impact
of the great disparity in school resources between black and white students in North and South
Carolina that existed in the first half of the 20th century, and the subsequent narrowing of these
resource disparities. Following birth cohorts over time, gaps in earnings and educational attainment
for blacks and whites in the Carolinas tend to mirror the gaps in school resources.
