WHY CLASHES BETWEEN INTERNAL
AND EXTERNAL STABILITY GOALS END
IN CURRENCY CRISES, 1797-1994

ABST RACT

We argue that recent currency crises reflect clashes between fundamentals

and pegged

exchange rates, just as did crises in the past. We reject the view that crises reflect self-fulfilling
prophecies

that are not closely related to measured fundamentals.

Doubts about the timing of a

market attack on a currency are less important than the fact that it is bound to happen if a
government’s policies are inconsistent with pegged exchange rates. We base these conclusions on
a review of currency crises in the historical record under metallic monetary regimes and of crises
post-World

War II under Bretton Woods, and since, in European and Latin American pegged

exchange rate regimes.

WHY CLASHES BETWEEN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STABILITY GOALS
END IN CURRENCY CRISES, 1797-1994

1. Introduction
The Mexican crisis of December 1994 and the European Monetary System (EMS)
crisis of September 1992 have aroused interest in the subject of currency
crises. Academics seek to understand their causes and propagation mechanisms,
Policy makers debate the need for new mechanisms to prevent them.
In the traditional view, a country faces a currency crisis when
inconsistencies arise between preserving pegged exchange rates, whether fixed
or crawling pegs, and protecting domestic monetary and fiscal policy -- the
fundamentals

-- for the sake of internal stability and competitiveness.

For

countries that are part of a pegged exchange rate system, such as Bretton
Woods or the EMS, crises are an endemic part of the system. They arise because
of unexpected shocks that may make unsustainable policies that were previously
compatible with existing exchange rate arrangements. Market participants
understand this tension and precipitate an attack on a currency by selling it
short when destabilizing shocks occur.
Recently, the traditional view and its modern extension, speculative
attack models based on rational expectations, have been challenged by the view
that currency crises reflect self-fulfilling prophecies that are not closely
related to measured fundamentals. Crises instead can happen under conditions
of multiple equilibria in the foreign exchange market. In this paper we argue
that recent crises reflect fundamentals, just as did crises in the past. The
trick is to identify the fundamentals.
We define a currency crisis as a market-based

attack on the exchange

value of a currency. It involves a break with earlier market judgment about

2
the exchange value of a currency. If a devaluation, which also involves a
change in the peg, does not occur because of market pressure, it does not
qualify as a currency crisis. In both cases, however, it is imperative to sort
out the inconsistency between fundamentals and the pegged rate. 1 A currency
crisis is also different from a banking panic, which sharply increases the
demand for currency, but the two types of crises may feed upon one another
(Krugman, 1991; Bordo, Mizrach, and Schwartz, 1996).
We report in section 2 the discussion in the literature of the two
competing theories of currency crises: the classical view based on
fundamentals , and the recent view based on self-fulfilling prophecies.
judgment on

For a

the validity of the competing theories we believe the crises of

experience offer guidance. In section 3 we examine famous historical

examples

of crises from 1797 to World War II. In section 4 we examine post-World War II
crises . In section 5 we offer lessons from history.
2. The Literature on Currency Crises
In the traditional view on currency crises, pegged exchange rates are durable
only as long as monetary authorities are credibly committed to maintaining
them. This requires that domestic policy always is subordinated to the
objective of maintaining

the fixed exchange rate. Under the classical gold

standard, the commitment to the fixed price of gold was credible for the core
countries of Western Europe and the United States. Speculative attacks on

1 Frankel and Rose (1996) define a currency crash in emerging markets as
a nominal depreciation of at least 25% that is also at least a 10%
increase in the rate of depreciation. Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz
(1995) distinguish between a devaluation and a currency crisis. Both
are preceded by monetary and fiscal expansion and the deterioration of
other fundamentals, but in a devaluation inconsistent policies are
reversed with a change in parity, whereas in a currency crisis
inconsistent policies continue after the parity change.

3
their currencies that forced abandonment or alteration of the parity rarely
occurred.z
Under special circumstances,

such as wartime emergencies or financial

exigency, the commitment might be temporarily suspended, but the market
understood that the original parity would be restored once the emergency had
passed. These events, moreover, were rarely characterized by the type of
duress crises today are subject to. For peripheral countries, such as the
Latin American countries, however, the pattern set by the core countries is
not observed. They suspended convertibility and altered parities when
subordinating domestic needs to the dictates of external balance proved
onerous (Bordo and Schwartz, 1996) .
Of two recent interpretations of currency crises, both based on the
postulate of rational expectations, one extends the traditional view,
maintaining that speculative attacks on a currency are driven by the
incompatibility of the pegged exchange rate and expansionary domestic
financial policy, the other, maintaining that currency crises are not
necessarily driven by a conflict between deteriorating fundamentals and the
pegged exchange rate, but reflect self-fulfilling prophecies. The innovation
of the first interpretation is that the timing of the attack is predictable,
It occurs before the monetary authority has exhausted its reserves, In the
second interpretation, the timing is not predictable.

Crises may be self-

fulfilling prophecies of market participants. Because their expectations are
that the monetary authority’s policies will be inconsistent with the peg, they

2 Incipient attacks on the Bank of England and other central banks were
countered on several occasions by central bank cooperation and, more
important, stabilizing short-term capital flows by market participants
confident of the credibility of the commitment to gold parity (Bordo
and Kydland, 1996; Eichengreen, 1992).

take actions to force the authority to abandon the peg and thereby ratify
their expectations. Crises occur in circumstances of multiple equilibria
indeterminacy

--

-- in foreign exchange markets, in which random shocks called

sunspots can trigger an attack.
2.1. Classical Currency Crises

(1979) and Floyd and Garber (1984a) argue

stock to the lowest level since 1936.

A persistent dollar outflow thereafter accelerated in the first few days of
May 1971, overwhelming

foreign exchange markets. On 5 May seven European

countries closed their foreign exchange markets, and five others on several
continents withdrew their support for the dollar. Dealings in D-marks,
guilders, and Swiss francs were suspended. On 9 May both Germany and Holland
announced that their currencies would float, since they could not maintain
exchange rates within the established margins.
The devaluation of the dollar vis-a-vis the D-mark as the result of the
float left unsolved the dollar’s exchange rate vis-a-vis the yen. Japan’s
capital controls were proof against the dollar flows that inundated European
foreign exchange markets but not against the large deficit in U.S. trade with
Japan. That bilateral trade imbalance was a provocation, over and above the
imbalance between U.S. gold reserves and outstanding dollar liabilities, for
the changes the United States introduced on 15 August 1971 to achieve a dollar
devaluation. The convertibility of the dollar was formally suspended, as was
the use of the swap network through which dollars could be exchanged with
central banks for other currencies.
The effect was to oblige other countries to hold dollars or to trade
them for a price determined in the market and so to revalue their currencies.
Foreign exchange markets abroad, except in Japan, shut down. The Japanese
