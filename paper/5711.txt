Until a risk-related

premium

structure was introduced

in the 1990s, the flat explicit

deposit insurance premium paid by U.S. banks created an incentive for insured banks to
increase their risk exposurel. Viewing the bank’s deposit guarantee as a put option written
by the FDIC, Merton (1977) shows that the value of this option to the bank would
increase with asset risk and leverage risk. Higher risk increases the value of the FDIC’s
insurance services.

If the incremental cost a bank pays for these services does not rise to

absorb this value, increasing

sums up the paper.
1. The Model
Ronn and Verma ( 1986) model the fair premium for deposit insurance services (P) as
the value of a limited-term (one year) put option:

N(y~)–

IP=B,

(l-a)nv~,
~

where B 1 is the face value of insured deposits,

~(y,

) ,

(1)

B is the face value of insured and

uninsured debt, V is the value of bank assets, 5 is the dividend per dollar of assets, n is
the number of times per period the dividend is paid.

Variables yl and y2 are defined as

follows:

y, =

ln[B/V(l–6)’’]

-0~T/2
7

Ovfi

Y2=y1+crvti,

where Ov is the instantaneous

standard deviation of asset returns, N(0) is the cumulative

standard normal distribution, T is the effective maturity (one year).
It is convenient to estimate IPP, the insurance premium per dollar of insured deposits:

4

ZPP=ZP/B,

=~(yz)–

(l–d)n;

~(yl).

(2)

4

Neither the market value of bank assets, V, nor the standard deviation of asset returns, Ov,
is observable.

They can, however, be estimated using two additional equations.

The

first equation states the call option valuation assignable to the equity of a levered firm:
E =

VN(X,) –pBN(x2)

(3)

,

where E is the value of the bank’s equity, p is the exercise price, as a percentage of the
value of deposits.
Variables xl and x2 are defined as follows:

x, =

ln[V/pB]+o~T/2
O“@

‘

-ovti,

x,=x,

We follow Ronn and Verrna (1986) in modeling FDIC forbearance policy as lowering the
exercise price of the shareholders’ call option below the value of bank deposits by setting
p = 0.97. This procedure neglects the option value of further FDIC forbearance when the
p threshold is crossed (Kane (1986)).
The second equation states a relationship between Ov and ~E that follows from Ito’s
lemma:
~_ogl
V—E

v N(x, ) “

(4)

Here, ~E is the instantaneous standard deviation of equity returns.
Comparative-static

analysis of equation (2) implies that a manager can increase the

value of the deposit insurance subsidy by increasing asset risk Ov and/or leverage B/V.

In regression (9), the left-hand side variable o “, is calculated from variables that include
the dependent variable BW. This implies that estimates of U1 from model (9) are biased
by variable definitions.

To clarify this, we note from (3) and (4) that:

IV. Summary and Conclusions
U.S. experience with state deposit-insurance

systems (Calomiris,

1992) and corporate

finance theory hold that weaknesses in deposit insurance pricing and capital enforcement
encourage banks to extract deposit insurance subsidies by increasing their risk exposure.
To test this hypothesis, we decompose it into three parts.

In contrast to the biased procedure, our tests indicate that risk-

restraining factors are weak.
The second part of our tests investigates the frequency of risk shifting among sample
banks.

Our results indicate that about five percent of the sampled banks succeeded in

increasing their deposit insurance subsidy consistently over observation periods of four to
ten years.
A third set of tests focuses on endogenous risk-shifting by banks in periods for which

Consistent with finance theory, we affirm that risk-shifting behavior is concentrated at the
financially weakest banks.
An array of sensitivity tests establi~h the robustness of our principal finding: troubled
U.S. banks actively engaged in risk-shifting during 1985-1994 and the regulatory system
failed to restrain this behavior adequately.

The Relation between Bank Leverage and Asset Risk: Time-Series Tests
Time series tests of Hypothesis

1: al 20.

The al is the slope coefficient in the following structural model:
(9)

Bji / Vj( = %j + ~(j~vjt + Ejt.

where Bjl / Vjl is the leverage, ~vj( is the annualized standard deviation of asset returns for bank j in quarter
t.
The table below reports two estimates of al: a direct estimate from linear model (9) and an estimate from
the following reduced form nonlinear regression:
Bjt / Vjt = (%j +

The Relation between Fair Deposit Insurance Premium and Asset Risk:
Pooled Time-Series-Cross-Sectional
Hypothesis

2: ~1 20.

Tests

The ~1 is the slope coefficient in the following regression:
IPPjl = ~Oji+

~tavjl

(lo)

+ &jt ,

where IPPj( is the risk-adjusted insurance premium per dollar of insured deposits, ~vjt is the annualized
standard deviation of asset returns for bank j in quarter t.
Hypothesis 4: ~1*SO. The ~1’ is the first slope coefficient in the following regression:
IPPjt = ~ojt + ~l]d~vj~ + ~l”(l-d)ovj,
where d = 1 for undercapitalized

+

institutions and O otherwise.

Panel A: Pooled regression tests of Hypotheses 2 and 4 using the fixed-effects
