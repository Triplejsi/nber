IS “LEARNING-BY-EXPORTING”
IMPORTANT? MICRO-DYNAMIC EVIDENCE
FROM COLOMBIA, MEXICO AND MOROCCO

ABSTRACT

Is there any empirical evidence that firms become more efficient after becoming exporters?
Do firms that become exporters generate positive spillovers for domestically-oriented

producers?

In this paper we analyze the causal links between exporting and productivity using firm-level panel
data from three semi-industrialized
production

countries.

Representing

export market participation

and

costs as jointly dependent autoregressive processes, we look for evidence that firms’

stochastic cost processes shift when they break into foreign markets. We find that relatively efficient

but firms’ unit costs are not affected by previous

market

So the well-known efficiency gap between exporters and non-exporters is due to self-

selection of the more efficient firms into the export market, rather than learning by exporting,
Further, we find some evidence that exporters reduce the costs of breaking into foreign markets for
domestically

oriented producers, but they do not appear to help these producers become more

efficient.

Many analysts believe that export-led development

strategies improve technical efficiency.

And
f

one oft-cited reason is that exporters may benefit from the technical expertise of their buyers!
. . . a good deal of the information

needed to augment basic capabilities has come from
the buyers of exports who freely provided product designs and offered technical
assistance to improve process technology in the context of their sourcing activities,
Some part of the efficiency of export-led development must therefore be attributed to
externalities derived from exporting.” (Evenson and Westphal, 1995).
Buyers want low-cost, better-quality products from major suppliers. To obtain this, they
transmit tacit and occasionally proprietary knowledge from their other, ofien OECDeconomy, suppliers. (World Bank, 1993, p. 320).
The important thing about foreign buyers, many of which have offices in Seoul, is that
they do much more than buy and specifi. . . They come in, too, with models and patterns
for Korean engineers to follow, and they even go out to the production line to teach
workers how to do things (Rhee, Ross-Larson, and Pursell, 1984, p. 41)
In support of this view, empirical studies often find that exporting plants are more efficient than
their domestically

oriented counterparts

(Aw and Hwang, 1995; Bernard and Jensen, 1995, Chen and

Tang, 1987; Haddad, 1993; Handoussa, Nishimizu

and Page, 1986; Tybout and Westbrook,

1995;

Roberts, Sullivan and Tybout, 1995). But, with the exception of Bernard and Jensen (1995) none of these
studies has asked the question of whether exporting causes eficiency

Further, to assess the case

we test whether exporters generate external benefits for other firms, either by

acting as a conduit for knowledge that they acquire through trade, or by causing improvements

Our methodology

for detecting learning effects

is based on a simple idea. If exporting indeed

generates efficiency gains, then firms that begin to export should thereafter exhibit a change in the
stochastic process that governs their productivity growth. Hence their productivi~

trajectories must

improve in some sense afier they enter foreign markets, Similarly, if the presence of exporters generates
positive externalities,

non-exporters

in the affected industry or region should exhibit changes in their cost

process when the number of exporters changes.

Increases in the number of exporters may also make it

easier for others to break into foreign markets.
To keep track of causal linkages we begin by specibing

envision firms as solving (section II). Each manager faces stochastic cost and foreign demand processes,

Several patterns merit note. First and most obviously, regardless of whether learning effects are present,

is that exporting firms exhibit

ongoing cost reductions afier initiating foreign sales. Only when learning effects are present, do firms
continue to pull away from non-exporters

afier foreign market entry.

Finally, relative to the no learning case, learning makes firms enter (and stay in) export markets
at higher costs. This occurs because the incentives to export are larger when learning occurs. Productivity
dispersion may thus be higher among exporters when learning effects are present, and the productivity
gap between exporters and non-exporters

may be smaller.s

Our data allow us to follow individual producers through time in Colombia, Mexico and

Morocco.

In the case of Colombia, they describe virtually all plants with at least 10 workers over the

period 1981-199 1; in Mexico, they describe 2800 of the larger firms over the period 1986-1990, and in
Morocco they cover most all firms with at least 10 workers over the period 1984-1991?

distinguish the five varieties of plants defined in Table 2, and for each plant we re-define period zero to
be the year in which a change in export status takes place. Then we isolate five-year blocks of time,
running from two years prior to the status change (1 = -2) to two years after (t = 2); 1 For non-exporters
and exporters there is no change in status, so we take five yens in the middle of the sample period (for
Colombia we take seven years).

One might argue about whether the entrants show evidence of reducing their costs afier
beginning to export, but the effect is certainly not dramatic. The F-statistic for the null hypothesis that the
mean average cost level among entrants shows no variation relative to the industry norms has a p-value of
.08 in Colombia, and a p-value of .25 in Mexico. ‘2 Further, in Mexico, entrants’ average costs are

The Econometric

Our treatment of the export market participation

Equation (7) then implies that ~, obeys the following dynamic discrete process:

1’ If we allow for much generality in the processes (2) and (3), it becomes very diff]cult to estimate all the
structural parameters of the model. Yet imposing restrictions on these processes may well lead us to incorrectly
conclude that past participation in the export market influences current marginal costs. For example, misspeci~ing
equations (2) and (3) to be first-order processes may force any dependence of current costs on additional lags (e.g.,

is to look for learning effects, it is desirable to pursue a reduced-form approach,

Solution

In the type of problem presented in section II, the optimal participation

policy usually involves

two trigger levels defined, for our purposes, in terms of marginal cost levels, ~ < Cu, such that a nonexporting plant will start exporting when its costs are no larger than ~, and an exporting plant will cease
exporting when its costs equal or are larger than CV
We will assume that this is indeed the type of policy followed by the plant and focus on
computing the trigger points. For this pupose, we assume that c is a random variable that takes any one
of K discrete values cl,.. .,c~, and evolves over time according to a stationary Markov process with

This may well result in higher expected costs for exporting plants when learning

firms tend to enter the export market and remain

exporters for longer periods of time when learning effects prevail .
Figure 2.2A provides such an example.

In this case, the entry trigger is ~= 4 and the exit trigger

is Cu= 8. After three years in the export market the average costs is 2.93 while in the no-learning

model it

equals 2.08. Hence, even though costs decline by 27 percent afier 3 years exporting, the average costs of
exporters relative to the average cost of non-exporters
