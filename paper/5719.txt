PRICE LEVEL TARGETING VS. INFLATION
TARGETING: A FREE LUNCH? WAGE

ABSTRACT

Price level targeting (without base drift) and inflation targeting (with base drift) are compared
under commitment and discretion, with persistence in unemployment.

Price level targeting is often

said to imply more short-run inflation variability and thereby more employment

variability than

inflation targeting. Counter to this conventional wisdom, under discretion a price level target results
in lower inflation variability than an inflation target (if unemployment
persistent).

is at least moderately

A price level target also eliminates the inflation bias under discretion and, as is well

known, reduces long-term price variability. Society may be better off assigning a price level target
to the central bank even if its preferences correspond to inflation targeting. A price level target thus
appears to have more advantages than commonly acknowledged.

Introduction

“Priw stability”

is often rmmmended

as a god for monetary policy. Price stability has been

interpreted in different ways, though. Price stability can be interpreted as ptia

In practim, price stability h= often been

As is well known, unless above-average ifiation

is

followed by below-average inflation, this restits in base drift of the price level. Bsse drift in
the price level implies that the prim level kma

non-trend-stationary, and the variance of the

future price level increases without bounds with the for~t

horizon. This is obviously rather

far from literal prim stability. I shall refer to a monetary policy regime M prim level taqetzng
or infiattin taqei!ing, depending upon whether the goal is a stable pri~ level or a low and stable
itiation

rate, where the latter allows base drift of the pri~ level.

In the real world, there are currently several monetary policy regimes with explicit or implicit
idation

targeting (see Haldane (1995) and Leiderrnan and Svensson (1995)), but there are no

regimes with explicit or implicit price level targeting.

Whereas the Gold Standard may be

interpreted as implying implicit price level targeting, Sweden during 1931-33 may so far have
been the only regime in history with explicit prim level targeting (cf. Fisher (1934) and Jonu.ng
(1979)).
Even if there are no current examples of prim level target regimes, prim level targeting
has received incre=ing

interest in the monetary policy literature, and several recent papers

compare inflation targeting and price level targeting.

(1995)).

Other papem compare the properties of postulated simple stochastic processes for

inflation and the prim level (Duguay (1994), Fischer (1994)).

A frequent restit, emerging as

the conventional wisdom, is that the choim between price-level targeting and inflation targeting
involves a trade-off between low-frequency price level unmrtainty on the one hand and highfrequency ifiation

and output uncertainty on the other. 1 Thus, price level targeting has the

Applying poatulatd

monetary policy reaction functions, ‘instrument rules’, evokes the issue

of whether these reaction tictions

are optimal for reasonable objective functions of the cen-

tral bank, and whether they are consistent with the realistic situation when the central bank
acts under discretion and mmmitment to an optimal or a simple second-best rule (like those in
McCaUurn (1990) or Taylor (1994)) is not possible (cf. Laidler (1993)). Similarly, applying postulated pr~ses

for ifiation

and the price level evoka the issue of whether these are consistent

with a reasonable equilibria.
The purpose of this paper is to mmpare pri~

level and tiation

targeting, but the pa-

per departs from the previom literature on price level veraus inflation targeting by applying a
principal-agent approach: the decision rules considered are the endogenous decision rules that
result when society (the principal) ~signa (delegates) an inflation target or a price level target to a central bank (the agent) scting under discretion.

In mmparison, the mrresponding

endogenous decision rules under commitment are also reported, although the focus is on the
discretion case. The reaction functions are henm endogenous, given central bank objectives and
mnstraints, including available mmmitment technology.
The paper follows Svensson (1996) in interpreting inflation targeting 59 including an explicit iflation

target and an implicit employment target, with an implicit relative weight on

employment stabilization. This is motivated by the existence of target bands in actual inflation

providesa relativelysmall gain in long run price predictabili~, sine prim levelvariability (for the U. S.) is already
relatively small under inflation targeting. Gerlach (1993) interprets inflation targets ss a ‘target zone’ for the
price level. Scarth (1994), Crawfordand Du~uier

Price level targeting is

consequently interpreted as including an explicit price level target, together with an implicit

Prim level targeting then results in

targeting. This r~ult is due to the endogenous decision

rule that results under discretion for different targets.

Under inflation targeting the decision

rule is a linear feed-back n..de for inflation on employment.

Then the variance of tiation

is

proportional to the varianm of employment. Under prim level targeting, the decision rule is a
linear feed-bd

rule for the price level on employment. Then inflation is a linear function of the

first diflemna of employment. The varianm of ifiation

is then

proportional to the varianm of

the fist differenm of employment. With at least moderate persistent,

the variance of the &t

The treatment of tiation

targeting under peraistenm follows Svensson (1996), which in turn

builds on the recent extension of the analysis of rul~ and discretion in monetary policy to
the case of persistence in Lockwood and Philippopoulos (1994), Jomson (1995) and Lockwood,
Miller and Zhang (1995), The short-run Phillips curve is

where lt is (the log) employment rate in period t, o and p are mmtants (a >0 and O s p < 1),
nt = pt —pt_ 1 is the (log of the gross) inflation rate, pt is the (log) prim level, n: denotes price
level expectations in period t – 1 of the prim level in period t, and et is an i.i.d. supply shock

parameters of the model. The short-run Phillips curve corresponds, for instance, to a situation in
which nominal wagea for period t are set one period in advanw, b~ed on expect atiom in period
t – 1, without knowing the supply shock Etin period t. The (long-run) natural employment rate,
which I identify with the unmnditional mean of the employment rate, E[lt], is for mnvenience set
equal to zero. The autoregressive term arisea, for instance, in wage setting models where trade
unions set nominal wages one period in advanm, disregarding non-union workers’ preferences
and only taking inti account union members’ preferences for real wages and employment, and
where union membership dependa on previous employment.

The role of the

surprises.

As noted in the literature, such benefits can also arise for other reasons, for instance, if a surprise

The employment rate will behave as (2.14).

With persistence, the prim level response to supply shocks is larger under discretion than
under commitment.

Sinm, under discretion, the future price level bias depends on current

employment, it becomes even more important to stabilize employment. This requires a stronger
prim level response. The price level under price level targeting behaves precisely as the inflation

inflation is the same aa under tiation

Indeed, comparing itiation

under idation

targeting and price level targeting, we note that

inflation under inflation targeting is a linear function of employment (Table 1, row (4)), whereas
under price level targeting it is a linear function of the first diffemnti of employment (Table 2,
row (4)). The unmnditional varianm of these are by Table 2 related as
Var [it – 1~-~]= 2(1 – p)Var [1~].

Evaluation

of price level target equilibria

with ifiation

target

preferences

E social preferences mrrespond to the price level period 10SSfunction (3.3), it is obvious that a
price level target equilibrium is preferable to an inflation target equilibrium. The two equilibria
have identical employment behavior, but in the inflation target equilibrium the prim level is
non-trend-stationary

and furthermore grows faster than the target price level by the inflation

bias.
If social preferences mrrespond to the ifiation

target period loss function (2.4), can the price

level target equilibrium still be preferable? That is, would it be preferable to assign a price level
target to the central bank even if social preferences mncern inflation rather than the price level.
In order to answer this question, both equilibria must be evaluated with the inflation-target
social loss function.

For the ifiation

target quilibriurn,

the relevant indirect loss function is

defined in the d=ision problem (2.11) and given by (2.12), with the mefficients $1 and ~z given
by (2,16) and (2.17). The aficient

~0 is derived in the appendix and given in (A. 16).

where (3. 10) and (2. 14) is substituted for nc and lC. This value function will be quadratic and
can be written

where the ~fficients

In order to answer the question above, I thus need to mmpute

(4.3)
This is done in detail in the appendix. However, it is intuitively clear that price level targeting
is better than ifiation

targeting if society has inflation target preferences (if there is at least

moderate employment persistent),

since with price level targeting (i) the variability of inflation

is less, (ii) any inflation bias is eliminated, and (iii) employment behavior is the same.
This result can be further illuminated by a direct comparison of the decision rules. The
optimal rule under commitment with inflation targeting is (2.7).

Due to (2.10), it can be

Unemployment behavior is the same. There is no

employment rati, lt —pit– 1, than jmt the employment rate, lt.
This comparison of decision rul~ abo reveals that price level targeting under discretion does
not deliver the optimal rule for inflation targeting under commitment. Svensson (1996) examines
how modified inflation targets can improve the discretionary equilibrium with persistence in
employment and compares with Rogoff (1985) ‘conservative’

central banks and with Walsh

(1995)-Persson and Tabel.lini (1993) linear inflation contracts.

Conclusions

targeting involves

a trade-off between (1) less low-frequency price level variabilityy and (2) less high-frequency
itiation and employment variabihty. This mnventional wisdom arises from the use of exogenous
react ion functions or exogenous inflation and price level processes, which may or may not be
consistent with objwtives and constraints (including commitment technologies) faced by central
banks. In contrast, this paper examines price level and itiation targeting by deriving endogenous

In this framework, prim level targeting naturally results in lower low-frequency price level

reason is that under inflation targeting ifiation

depends on the employment rate, whereas under

the change in the rate is less variable than the rate itself.
In addition, prim level targeting eliminates the average itiation

targeting when the implicit employment target is lower than the natural employment

rate,
If society’s preferences mrrespond to price level targeting, prim level targeting is clearly
better than ifiation

targeting, since the latter results in a non-trend-stationary

prim level and,

when there is an inflation bias, in a price level that increasingly deviates from the target price
level. If society’s preferenms instead correspond to tiation

targeting, inflation depends on the

employment rate; under prim level targeting itiation depends on the change in the employment
rate; when employment is persistent, the latter is a better approximation to the supply shock
than the former .
The paper has demonstrated the importance of employment persistent

for the results, and,

I hope, the benefits of deriving endogenous decision rules for assigned targets rather thm using
postulated reaction functiom.
In the model used here price level targeting and i~ation

targeting result in the same employ-

ment variability. This is because both regimes readt in the same conditional one-period variance
of the prim level and the idation

rate (although the unconditional variability of one-period in-

flation, and the mnditional more-than-one-period

variance of the prim level and ifiation

rate,

are lower under pri~ level targeting), and ordy the unanticipated part of one-period price movements affect employment.
However, if nominal wages are downwmdly rigid, anticipated negative inflation (deflation)
would increase real wages and increase employment. This may increase employment variability;
in particular it may redum avemge employment. The eff~t haa &n

studid

by Lebow, Roberts

and Stockton (1992), Crawford and Dupaaqtier (1994), Fillon and Tetlow (1994) and Akerlof,
Dickens and Perry (1996).

For given ifiation

variability, the effect depends on the average

16

inflation rate, regardless of whether there is price level or inflation targeting. The effect is hence
an argument for a positive inflation target under i~ation

targeting and a prim level target that

increases at a steady rate during priw level targeting, since that would reduce the frequency of
deflation. However, the reduced variability of inflation under price level targeting still seems to
be an argument in favor of price level targeting. Productivity growth will in any cue reduce the
effect, For the Unitd

States, Lebow Stockton and Wascher (1995) report empirical evidence

that indicate little downward rigidity and very small aggregate output effects of reducing U.S.
ifiation

to zero, and in simulations Fillon and Tetlow (1994) also report small output effects.

Akerlof, Dickens and Perry (1996) find larger output and unemployment effects, though.

Any

degree of downward nominal rigidity is, however, likely to be endogenous and regime dependent
and hence decrease with less ifiation. 11
Nonnegative nominal interest rates have also been used as an ar~ent
rate, sins

low or negative idation

for a positive inflation

could then result in too high real interest rates, and in

particular prevent monetary policy from being sufficiently expansionary in recessions (Summers
(1991)). But, Lebow (1993) shows that monetary policy can still be expansionary by using other
instruments than interest rates on government bonds and bills, if these interest rates occasionally
fall to zero. In simulations Fuhrer and Madigan (1994) find very small effects on output from
nonnegative nominal interest rate9. The problem will be smaller, if future real interest rates
are generally higher than in the 1960s and the 1970s. For a given average itiat ion rate, the
reduced itiation

viability

under prim level targeting again seems to speak in favor of price

level targeting.
In any case, to the extent that downwardly rigid nominal wages and nonnegative nominal
interest rates imply a positive average inflation rate, there is no principle difficulty with a price
level target which incre~

at a steady rate, since that does not redum the predictability of the

price level.
The parameters of the Phillips curve (the slope, the degree of persistence, and the variance of
supply shocks) might not be invariant to a shift from ifiation

targeting to price level targeting.

It is not obviom, though, whether the parameters are likely to change and if so, in what direction,
-pecially

since conditional variances (and average inflation in case the employment target equals

the natural rate) are the same in the two regimes, Clearly a more elaborate analysis with explicit

Will random walk measurement errors of the price level provide an argument agaimt price
level targeting?

No, for if there are such me~urement

errors, there will be an unavoidable

random walk mmponent to the ‘true’ pri~ level, but tiation

targeting will add another random

walk mmponent, making the variance of the prim level still higher under inflation targeting than
under prim level targeting.
What is the effect of mntrol errors? Suppose there are i,i.d. control errors, qt, on the price
level, with varianm u;. Under itiation

targeting, this will add a; to the varianm of iflation.

Under price level targeting, this will be added twim to the variance of inflation, which means
that the degrm of persistent

must be somewhat higher (than a half), in order to make the

itiat ion varianm less under price level targeting (unless the variance due to mntrol errors is so
huge as to dominate all other SOW-of

variability).

Do social preferenm

mrrespond to inflation targeting or price level targeting? What are the

social benefits of redud

long-term uncertainty of the prim level? This seems to be an under-

researched area (see Konieczny (1994) and Duguay (1994) for discussion).

There are obvious

informational and computational benefits of a stable, or at least predictable, unit of account
for intertemporal decisions and for decisions that occur relatively infrequently. Although these
benefits are obvious, they are difficult to asses quantitatively.

Standard mnomic

theory is

certainly at a disadvantage assessing such costs, sinm it relies on the assumption on unbounded
mmputational capacity of agents. I believe that we have to some extent become so used to a
