from Innovation:

in the late 1980’s

INTRODUCTION
Product

innovations contribute to economic progress by expanding the range of choices

available to consumers and by improving the performance dimensions of existing products. However,
the incentives to innovate do not stem directly from the social value of new or improved products
but from the private returns that innovators manage to capture in the marketplace.

In order to be

an effmtive inducement, these potential rents must be secured from the competitive threats posed by
pre-existing

products, from imitators, and, at least for some time, from products extending the

technological frontier even further. As Arrow (1962) pointed out, innovators have to enjoy some
degree of transitory market power in order to pay for their innovations.

Of course, the classical justification

for patents, trademarks,

and other forms of formal

intellectual property protection is precisely their ability to provide temporary monopoly power in
order to prompt innovation and creativity; yet, these forms of protection seem to have played only
a minor role in ensuring innovative rents in the PC industry during the late 1980s. ] Consequently,

and relying on a brand name reputation (such as that of IBM) played

in ensuring transitory market power to innovative PC firms.
Our starting point is the fact that markets for differentiated products often exhibit some form
of segmentation or clustering

according to a small number of “principles of differentiation” (PDs).

Each PD defines a distinct notion of product similarity according to the presence or absence of some
key product characteristic and offers a potential source of market segmentation.

Thus, products that

belong to the same cluster (defined by these PDs) would be closer substitutes to each other than to
products

belonging to other clusters. We consider here two such principles:

the instruments that we use for that purpose, and the issues that we address with the

estimates all stem from and build upon these two principles of differentiation.
We devote the bulk of the paper to the estimation of a discrete choice model of demand for
PCS that allows us to evaluate the substitution patterns within and across these PDs. To do so, we
draw from and extend recent methodological advances in the empirical study of product differentiated
markets (Bresnahan

1981, 1987; Trajtenberg,

1990; Berry, 1994; Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes,

1995). Following Berry (1994), we motivate the functional form for the demand system by modeling
a discrete choice maximization problem faced by a set of heterogeneous consumers. We then account
for the potential correlation between price and unobserved quality by utilizing a set of instruments

The specific model that

we put forward, the “Principles of Differentiation (PD) Generalized Extreme Value (GEV),” is a
particular application of the GEV class of models suggested by McFadden (1978).

The PD GEV

allows us to treat different potential sources of segmentation symmetrically, thus overcoming the

hierarchical structure (and concomitant limitations) of the familiar Multi-Level Nested Logit model.
Finally, we take advantage of our priors about the prevailing principles of differentiation and use
instrumental variables that reflect “local” (i.e., within-PD) competitive conditions, thus exploiting an
additional source of variation in the context of our short panel dataset.
Our main findings are, first, that the PC market was indeed highly segmented during the late
1980s, along both the F and the B dimensions. Consequently, the effects of competitive events (such
as entry, imitation, or price cuts) in any one cluster were confined mostly to that particular cluster,
with little repercussion on the others.

For example, our simulations imply that less than 5% of the

market share achieved by a hypothetical clone entrant would be market-stealing

from other clusters.

The second finding is that the product differentiation advantages of B and F were qualitatively quite
different, The advantage associated with positioning a product at the technological

frontier was

limited to the relative isolation that it provided from the large number of NF competitors.

THE PC MARKET IN THE LATE 1980s3
Technical change in personal computing has been extremely fast and sustained; moreover, the

nature of competition among PC fm

1987-88 catches the technology in swift transition with the introduction of a new microprocessor,

At the time when the 80386 was introduced (in late 1986), the

design and production of microcomputers

making effective use of the new chip posed considerable

technical difficulties, and required substantial R&D efforts from PC makers.4 By the end of 1986,
only the most technically capable PC firms had succeeded in introducing an 80386-based system. A
handful of other PC makers would see their development efforts succeed during our sample period,
whereas most other firms took even longer to come out with marketable 386 designs.
A key question posed in this paper is the extent to which PCS that belonged to the Frontier

3 We limit our analysis ~M PCS and IBM-compatible PCS. Following industry convention
at the time, we exclude both older, 8-bit computers (Apple II, CPM, etc.) and incompatible
architectures such as Apple Macintosh. While Macintosh and IBM-compatible machines would
converge in capabilities over time (particularly during the early 1990s), there was little important
overlap among commercial customers during the period under study.
4 By the mid- 1990s, it has become much easier to incorporate frontier technology into PC
design. This is because a much higher share of PC innovation has become embedded in the
components themselves (such as an Intel microprocessor) rather than in the integration among
components (see Henderson and Clark (1990) for a discussion between component-based versus
integration-based innovation). In the era under study in this paper, the opposite was true. PC
equipment manufacturers had to develop specialized skills and make substantial expenditures in
order to market a product on the technological frontier (Steffens, 1994).

,.

A close-up look at the transition from 286- to 386-based PCS suggests that there were
indeed pronounced differences across buyers in their assessment of the prospective benefits of 386ba.sed PCS, From an engineering perspective, the new systems yielded substantial improvements in
the ability to run software due to the increased speed of the microprocessor
model for the main memory.

and an improved address

However, some users (and analysts) saw 386-based systems just as

faster versions of older PCS. Others, already running or planning to run more advanced and
demanding software (such as the new Microsof~M

operating environment, Windows), saw them

as the only sufficient platform that would satisfy their computing needs within the useful life of the
current purchase. These conflicting opinions, echoed in lively debates in the trade press, presumably
led to sigtilcant differences among buyers in their willingness to pay for the much more capable but
also much more expensive 386-based PCS.5 We would expect such heterogeneity
steeply sloped demand curve for the Frontier PCS, as well as in poor substitutability

to result in a

between Frontier

and Non-Frontier systems. Our model will measure these features of demand, and hence the extent
to which Frontier PCS were insulated from Non-Frontier competition

at that time.

PCS differed not only in terms of their technical features, but also in terms of the brand-name
reputation that the manufacturers bestowed on them, During our sample period, PC buyers valued

as an indicator of high quality service and support from selling firms, as well as an

indication that the product was reliable and practical for business applications. IBM, the leading brand

a reputation for innovation in PCS (such as its introduction of the first 386-based PC

prior to IBM) and by providing reliable service and support for these frontier products (Steffen,
1994). Within a few years after our sample, several other firms built substantial brand reputations
by imitating Compaq’s strategy; however, except for Compaq, none had been successful prior to

In principle, not just Frontier and Brand but other aspects of PCS, technical and otherwise,
could have been the source of market segmentation

and hence of temporary monopoly power.

However, IBM’s historic deeision to have an open architecture for PCS (and the decision of the other
PC fm

at the time of our sample to be strictly compatible), allows us to eliminate outright a whole

class of potential sources of market segmentation. IBM’s open architecture meant that buyers could
“mix and match” a wide range of peripherals and add-in cards; therefore, price differentials between
PCS due to such components could be arbitraged away. 10 Given the existence of a competitive retail
market for unbundled components, variations in attributes such as the amount of RAM, or the size
of the hard disk, could not make one PC a poor substitute for another.

We therefore treat these

as hedonic attributes, in the sense that we allow them to shift the relative level of

demand for each PC but not to affect the substitution patterns between products.1 1
Having focused here on the sources of transito~

market power, it is important to put our

sample period in perspective, sketch the forces that brought rapid change to the PC industry, and
transformed time and again the patterns of competition in it. Both the supply of technically advanced
PCS and the demand for desktop computing are being shifted continuously by powerful dynamic
processes. The PC sector itself is technically progressive, Immediately upstream lie other fast-paced,

There are also a variety of technically progressive

industries downstream. Software products like operating systems, word processors, and spreadsheets
advance rapidly, pushing out the demand for more technical y advanced PCS.

10 Some PCS are limited in the amount of RAM they can maximally hold. Up to this limit,
however, buyers can typically populate the computer with more of less RAM according to their
budget and the software they seek to run. Sellers typically picked these limits so that they did not
bind on customers early in the life of the machine.
11 An intermediate case is microprocessor speed, expressed in MHZ. Buyers could not
arbitrage it, since speed is “designed into” the microprocessor and controller card. The
availability of several different processor speeds with most models somewhat mitigated this effect
since, in most cases, buyers could find their ideal point nearly met by an offered variation. We
examine this issue in a variant of our base specification.
7

These relentless changes mean that both sources of segmentation that we seek to measure,
Frontier

and Brand, were shifting rapidly.

Shortly after our period, a much larger number of

companies sold 386-based PCS. Later still, newer and faster microprocessors heralded a new frontier.
In the same era, a number of firms improved marketing operations, especially delivery and customer
support,

thereby approaching

Branded status.

In the early 1990s, the principal suppliers of

microprocessors and operating systems, Intel and Microsoft respectively, came to hold much of the
control of PC standards that IBM was losing in our sample period. 12The current PC industry
structure, with multiple technically capable branded firms competing, emerged from these events.
There is little doubt that these changes destroyed much of the transitory market power that we seek
to measure in a moment of transition.

However, the private incentives to innovate arise from the

discounted (expected) value of the rents which accrue in each period; in this sense, the period-specific
measurement of transitory market power is a key step towards understanding innovative investment

also needed. The dataset that we gathered for the present study consists of all PC make/ models
(boxes) for which accurate data on price and attributes could be obtained for 1987 and 1988.
Identifying a comprehensive, well-defined set of distinct make/models constituted a major stumbling
block. Because of the difficulties encountered in gathering accurate data for each and every box, we
restricted the scope of the dataset to those vendors with a relevant market presence (see Table 1).
The resulting sample consists of 121 make/models (observations) for 1987, and 137 for 1988.13

12 During and after our sample period, ~M attempted to regain control of PC market
standard setting via the 0S/2 operating system and the introduction of a novel (and proprietary)
PC design (Micro-Channel Architecture). Ultimately, IBM’s strategy to regain standard setting
leadership failed.

IV.

MODELING

THE DEMAND FOR PCS

The rest of this paper is devoted to estimating a model of PC demand which allows us to
evaluate precisely the origins of transitory market power and isolation from competition in the PC
market during 1987-88. We measure the demand for PCS at the product level and explore the
different competitive positions of PCS which incorporated different attributes. 17 Our model, based
on the familiar random utility model, aggregates from individual buyer heterogeneity to product level
demand. Besides corresponding to PC market reality, this permits straightforward

treatment of new

products and of products no longer being sold. Our model is novel in that it permits the existence of
non-overlapping principles of differentiation (like brandedness and frontiers status) without calling
for difficult numerical integration.

A.

THE RANDOM UTILITY APPROACH

TO DEMAND ESTIMATION

Our model of PC demand is motivated by the theory of random utility (Quando, 1956), as
developed in the “Generalized Extreme Value” (GEV) class of models put forward by McFadden
(1978) and following Berry’s recent proposal for the estimation of such models (Berry, 1994). Our
point of departure is a discrete choice random utility model. Each buyer is assumed to maximize by
choosing among J,+l alternatives (J[marketed products in year t and the option of no purchase (j=O)),
as follows,
MAX
j~{O,...,J,)

where Vi is the value of product j to buyer 1. For product j,

X j is a vector of observed product

p j is the price and ~j is the level of unobsemed product quality.

‘7 We exploit and extend recent methodological advances which have expanded the range of
economic models which can be estimated with product-level data (Bresnahan, 1981, 1987;
Trajtenberg, 1990; Berry, 1994; Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes, 1995).

The distribution of q depends on parameters p and the product

characteristics X. We write this (J+ 1 dimensional) CDF as F(q; X, p).

Thus, {~, a, p } is the vector

of parameters to be estimated in this discrete choice demand system.
Since the work of Quandt (1956), we have known that the distribution of the random shocks
to valuation, here q, is a key determinant of the shape of demand.

In the context of our discrete

choice model, there is in fact a precise relationship between the distribution of q at the individual
buyer level and the pattern of cross-product elasticities at the aggregate market level. The modeler
picks a family of distributions

F(q; X, p). Particular values of the parameter vector p correspond

to patterns of dependence in q across products sharing common (or similar) product characteristics.
Our model contains a parameter p~, for example, which permits dependence across the idiosyncratic

Now consider the impact of an increase in the price of particular product j: the value of
product j falls (at a rate a) and some portion of those consumers whom had initially chosen j are
induced to switch to what had been previously their second-best

alternatives.

Because of the

dependence in the distribution of q, a relatively high share of these second-best alternatives will be

products

makes those products closer substitutes.]a

The parameters p measure that dependence.

‘8 This type of dependence across observations can be contrasted with the case where q is iid
across choices (as in the multinominal logit). Under the assumption of independence, the

competition will become more “segmented,” in the sense that the impact of competitive events (such
as a price decrease or entry) will be confined mostly to those products with similar characteristics.
In other words, in this framework a model of which classes of products are close substitutes & a
model of dependence among the elements of q related to product characteristics.

theory,

in conjunction

with an understanding

Fortunately, economic

of the particular market under study, provides

considerable guidance. Like many other consumer products, there exists several features of the PC
(such as the amount of RAM or the size of the hard drive) for which there exists a separate market
for that feature (or component).

In the presence of competitive component markets, buyers will

arbitrage away price premiums msociated with the incorporation of these components into particular
products.

In other words, to the extent that consumers can “repackage” products along a specific

dimension, each consumer will equate their m~ginal utility for this dimension to its price in the postsales market. Accordingly, there wiUk no ex-post heterogeneity among consumers in their marginal
valuations for this dimension.

Thus, in choosing how to parametrize

the distribution function F(q;

X, p), one should incorporate potential correlation among products which share characteristics which
are not “repackageable,”
Guided by this rule, we focus on two product characteristics

which we argue are not

repackageable -- Branded and Frontier. The existence of a Brand name reputation, by construction,
cannot be marketed in the post-sales market. As well, during the period under study, considerable
technical expertise was required to incorporate the 80386 microprocessor

into a PC. In contrast,

buyers could entertain several post-sales options to recotilgure their memory options (e.g., RAM and
DISK) and, to a lesser extent, the speed of their microprocessor

(e.g., (5)) is that each product

MODELS OF SUBSTITUTION

Given our goal to measure the degree of segmentation afforded by (at least) two distinct PD’s
(B/NB and F/NF), several issues arise which make the most traditional

(and computationally

straightforward) parameterizations of the joint distribution of q inappropriate for our problem.

First,

because we want to distinguish between several different sources of product differentiation,

1996), in which several mutually exclusive dimensions of product differentiation can be incorporated,
is also inappropriate.

For example, if we were to specify (1) to be a two-level nested logit with the

In order to assess the relative merits of the PD GEV, it is worth comparing it in more detail

richly parameterized than a two-level NML. Instead, the difference between the two models is that

In particular, while in both models products sharing both B and F status are closer

substitutes to each other than to other prodL~cts,the models differ in their treatment of substitution
among the partially

matching products (note that the groups in the PD GEV are not mutually

exclusive).
Consider the two-level NML (with B on top) in the upper panel of Figure 1: the parameter
p~ determines how much “closer” products sharing both B and F are than those sharing only B. In
this sense, the NML is parameterizing

segmentation along more than one dimension.

However,

In this sense, the NML

permits only one of the two partially matching clusters to be close substitutes.

Moreover, reversing

the order of nesting just reverses the problem.2b
These properties can be stated also in terms of cross-elasticities,

H~ving to choose between (8) and (9) is an uncomfortable

specification choice. Neither of the

equalities seems likely to hold in the present context, since this case, as many others, is not naturally

The PD GEV overcomes this limitation by permitting both definitions of “local” to work in
a parallel fashion (see the second panel in Figure 1), i.e.,

The two principles of differentiation, B and F, are thus treated in a completely symmetric way, Of
course, this specflcation is still restrictive, as there are only two parameters permitting more closely
related products to be better substitutes. Thus, while the model is no more richly parameterized than
the nested logit, it is more appropriate for our specific application which is to identify the impact
arising from separate PDs.

In order to implement this procedure we need to isolate

~ and

express it as a function of data and parameters to be estimated. We are able to do so by “inverting”
the demand system. Recall from eq. (7) above that the market share of product j in a market with
J products can be written as,

(11)

19

Notice that every element of 8, the (J+l) vector of average product quality, enters the market share
equation of each product. Thus, with a complete cross-section

of products,

the market share

equations form a system of J equations with (J+ 1) unknowns (the vector 5). We invert this system
for the implicit function 6(s, p). Setting 8., the mean value of the outside good, equal to O, we solve

where Q is the standard weighting matrix. Thus, the estimation of the model requires only standard
techniques, and is computationally

straightforward.28

2s As suggested above (and in BLP ( 1995)), a two-step procedure is appropriate. First, 5 is
solved for as a function of the observed market shares and a “guess” for p (Eq. (12)). This
procedure involves a well-behaved numerical nonlinear procedure. With 6(s, p) in hand, the
remaining (mean-value) parameters (a, ~) can be estimated with a linear instrumental variables
estimator. Because the market share function can be expressed in closed form (see (11)), there is
no need for integration of the market share function on each iteration of the estimation. This
comes at a substantial computation savings relative to the simulated method of moments estimator

INSTRUMENTS
The GMM estimator in (15) requires an instrumental variables (IV) vector, Z, with rank at

least as large as the dimensionality of the parameter vector, {~, a, p}. Of course, the efficient IV
vector is composed of the derivatives of the disturbance (t) with respect to the parameters.

In the

current application it is quite difficult to construct the optimal Z, so we propose a simpler strategy
for the construction of Z for PD GEV models.
Our strategy

relies on the econometric

of the entire matrix of product

counts and means of X for products sold by the firm offering product j
counts and means of X for products sharing both cluster and seller.

This section first visits the general econometrics issues briefly. We then explain how our IV strategy
follows from an assumption of equilibrium pricing behavior by sellers in an industry with PD GEV
demand.
We face two challenges in constructing Z. With market power on the supply side, it is
dfilcult to just~

an assumption that price is independent of t; c has the interpretation of unobserved

29Our approach is most like of BLP ( 1995), who impose some of the economic restrictions of
their model on Z(X). Unlike BLP, we offer no proof that our Z is the first under term in a series
approximation to the optimal IV.
30 This problem was emphasized by Trajtenberg (1989, 1990), who found that the demand for
CT scanners was estimated to be positively sloped in the context of an NML model with
exogenous prices. Further analysis revealed that omitted quality, correlated with price, was indeed
the culprit for the positive bias. Our solution follows Berry (1994).

The immediate implication of this

is that we are able to include Xjdirectly in Z. This immediately reduces the number of

excluded instruments needed to dim ( a,p ). ‘2
In general, we are looking for easy-to-calculate variables which are likely to be correlated with
price and/or ( *

coefficients is supply .33To highlight this source of instruments, suppose that firms behave according
to the solution of a non-cooperative Bertrand-Nash price-setting game. Consider the FOC for product

Any exogenous variable which shifts the RHS is a candidate instrument.34 First, we specify
PD-specific indices to reflect the number and strength of close substitutes on a group-specific basis.
For example, as the number of products in a particular group increases, the demand curve associated
with each product in that group will shift in and become flatter in (16). Both effects should impact

32In our base model, which has two distributional parameters, each row of Z must have a

33This approach was critical to the identification of the (simpler) demand models of Bresnahan
(1981, 1987), in which model simplicity allowed for the analytical solution of equilibrium prices
and market shares.
‘4 As in many other industries, it is difficult to obtain observable product-specific cost shifters
for PCS; consequently, we do not attempt identification via that route. However, this strategy can
sometimes be used appropriately (Bresnahan and Baker, 1986; Hausman, 1994).

the observed price and the product’s within-group market “hare. Thus, the number of products in
each group will be correlated with the impact of the segmentation parameters, a and p, on prices and
the implicit function 5(s,p). Essentially, we exploit our assumption that the group-specific

entry

process is exogenous (in an econometric sense) to create a “local” index of the number of substitutes
for each product. As shown in Table 5, we implement this idea by calculating an instrument vector
for observation j which includes the number of products in F~) and B~), the groups to which product
j belongs, as well as sums over the characteristics of other products in FQ) and B(j).
We also calculate “Ownership”

instruments

(Iabelled so in Table 5) which exploit the

economics of multiproduct pricing as reflected in the RHS of (16). For example,

as a particular firm

sells a larger share of the number of total products available, it will charge a higher price on each
product (as compared to the prices which would be observed under a more unconcentrated

market

structure). Similarly, the sum of the characteristics of the products of the firm (other than j) will be
positively correlated with price, since that would mean higher q~ in eq.( 16).s5 Finally, we blend these
two analytical arguments

and use the characteristics

and count of products

which share both

ownership and cluster.
By using PD-spec~lc instruments, we use somewhat different instruments than our immediate
predecessors

in the literature (BLP (1995)). In particular, we are using our assumption about the

group structure of product differentiation to construct the excluded IVS. This strategy is successful
because some groups, like Frontier, saw much more entry than others. This entry, which we assume
to be exogenous, shifts prices and maket shares by changing competition. The different rates of entry
across groups means that our proposed instruments vary even in the short panel considered in the
present application. It is useful to note that our erogeneity assumption may not be as strong as it
seems at first blush. In particular, while we believe that entry into specific clusters is endogenously
determined by its economic returns, this does not mean that our instruments are correlated with the
error. We include dummies for both B and F in observable product quality; which means that ~ is
merely the deviation of the products’ quality from the cluster means.
Finally, the discussion so far has been predicated on the assumption that firms engage in

35 In this argument we closely follow BLP (1995).

competition.

However,

if firms play a different type of non-cooperative

game (e.g.

Coumot), then the precise form of (16) would change, but our instruments would be unaffected, since
the logic of ownership-based

and group-based instruments remains the same. Outright collusion

though would make a difference, since ownership-based

instruments would be longer be relevant.

More generally, the point is that the instruments should reflect the underlying supply and demand
conditions that prevail in the market, that is, the type of price setting behavior of firms, and the nature
of the heterogeneity of consumers as manifested in the groups. For the case at hand, we assume that
firms used individualistic pricing strategies; the pace of technical change in PCS and the ensuing
intensity of competition

seems to have prevented price collusion, However, we will explore the

importance of this assumption by removing the ownership-based

and PD-based instruments from Z

in the course of evaluating the robustness of our results.

VI.

RESULTS
We turn now to the presentation and analysis of results from the estimation of the PD GEV

for a variety of specifications. We also present estimates of alternative Two-Level NML and VPD
models and contrast them with the PD GEV. After exploring the robustness and limitations of the
model, we illustrate the meaning of the estimates by drawing hypothetical demand functions for
Branded

and Frontier PCS and perform a set of counterfactuals

involving hypothetical entry to

highlight the high degree of market segmentation that these estimates imply.

A.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
We frst preview our main findings (drawn from Model 1 in Table 6) in a concise fashion to

help frame the discussion of the results:
(I) 0< (p,,

competition (p~ < 1),

(iiz] As expected, the price coefficient, a, is sensitive to whether or not the model accounts for price
endogeneity, and to the type of instruments used. Models that ignore the correlation of price with
unobserved quality result in much smaller (in absolute value) estimates of a; models which do not
exploit the full set of proposed instruments severely reduce the precision of this estimate.

(iv) The choice of model specification turns out indeed to be important for analyzing the market under
study. In fact, the leading alternative to the PD GEV model, the Two-Level NML, yields estimates
that are highly sensitive to the order of nesting. In particular, the relative sizes and significance of the
substitution parameters are reversed in the Two-Level NML model with the B/NB nest on top, vis
a vis the one with the F/NF nest on top. Thus, the PD GEV model offers an attractive method~logical
alternative, at least in those cases where the nesting order is not well defined a priori.

MAIN SPECIFICATION,

ROBUSTNESS

AND IDENTIFICATION

We present in Table 6 our base specification (Model 1), two alternative specifications in
which we vary the elements of X (the set of product characteristics),

and a fourth one where we add

an additional PD. The parameters estimated are the distributional coefficients

p~ and p~, a price

coefficient, a , various ~s (a constant, and coefficients for FRONTIER, BRANDED, IBM, and for
a sub-set of DISK, RAM, and MHZ), as well as p~~z in Model 4.
As previewed above, the estimates of p~ and p~ are quite small in all these specifications.
In fact, even though p~ is estimated very imprecisely, one can easily reject the hypotheses that p~ =
1 and/or p~ = 1. The results for the price coefficient,

a, are encouraging: it is estimated to be

negative and quite stable across specflcations; however, its level of significance varies quite a bit (fair

25

in Models 1 and 2, nil in Models 3 and 4). In all four models, the BRANDED coefficient is large,
positive, and significant while the FRONTIER coefficient cannot be distinguished from zero (and is
in fact negative in three out of four specifications).

The ~M coefficient is positive and gives (at the

point estimate in the b~e specflcation) a 50% incremental boost to IBM products above and beyond
other Branded products. Finally, our technological control variables (DISK, RAM, and MHZ) have
the expected sign, though only the DISK coefficient is significant (in Model 1).36
It should be noted that the coefficients that determine the level and slope associated with B
and F, which are of particular interest here, are relatively stable across the four specifications.
Moreover,

the point estimates suggest that there was a qualitative

differentiation advantage afforded along the F versus the B dimension.

In fact, we are able to reject

the hypothesis:
HO: p~ = p~, PF =

~B

at the 90% level in our main spec~lcation (Wald test statistic = 5.22, X2(OW,
z, = 4.61). While the high
standard errors of the F coefficients do not allow us to draw firm conclusions (e.g., we cannot reject
~

at the 95% level), a cautious interpretation of this result is that, relative to the advantages arising

from having a brand name, being at the Frontier proved to be beneficial more in the sense of insulating
from competition than in pushing out the demand curve. In Model 4 we include a MHZ substitution
parameter (p~Hz = .99).37 In contrast to the substantial segmentation found along both the B and F
dimensions,

there seems to be little evidence that there existed segmentation

along the MHZ

dimension (we cannot reject HO: p~~z = 1).
In Table 7, we compare the estimates from the PD GEV with those from two alternative
spec~lcations of the Two-Level NML model. The most troubling
high sensitivity of the estimates to the order of nesting.

feature of Models 5 and 6 is the

In particular, with B/NB on top, p~ << pF,

36 We tried also combinations of these attributes, but the extremely high collinearity between
them, as well as between them on the one hand and PRICE and FRONTIER on the other,
rendered highly imprecise estimates.
37 Recall that specifying this model is easy. All that is required is the addition of several terms
to (6), each of which is a summation over sets of products which share a similar MHZ rating.
26

while the reverse occurs when F~F

is on top. Recall that a small p at a given level of the tree

signifies poor substitutability of products across branches at that level, and hence a high degree of
market segmentation

according to the PD that governs the split between branches. According to

Model 5, the crucial distinction resides in whether a PC is branded or not (p~ is both very small and
precisely estimated).

However, Model 6 implies the opposite, that is, that having Frontier status

confers insulation from competition from NF products, whereas Branded status does not provide
additional protection.

Obviously, there is no way of telling within this context which of the two

models, contradictory as they are, is the “right” one. In contrast to these awkward modeling choices,
the PD GEV confronts the issue of relative importance directly by treating the two principles of
differentiation symmetrically.
In Table 8 we vary the instrument set in order to examine the robustness of our findings to
alternative identflcation assumptions.

Model 7 treats prices as exogenous, ignoring their presumed

dependence on unobserved quality. The result is that the price coefficient shrinks dramatically (in
absolute value), providing weak evidence that prices are indeed endogenous (though we cannot reject
the overident~ing

restrictions). In Model 8, we eliminate the ownership-based

instruments, that is,

those that stem from the optimizing behavior of multi product firms. Similarly, Model 9 removes
PD-based instruments, that is, those associated with the variance in competition across groups, Each
of these exercises dramatically reduces the measured precision of the important parameters of the
model. The implication is quite clear: to identify our model, we constructed instruments that relied
on a behavioral assumption about supply and a structural one about the market. As it turns out, both
of these assumptions are necessary in order for us to provide evidence for our main findings.
We ran several other GEV specifications, accounting for serial correlation (across products
which appeared in both years), arbitrary heteroskedasticity,

and additional potential substitution

patterns (e.g., the inclusion of four separate substitution parameters, p~, p~~, p~, p~~).38 While there
exists no spec~lcation in which we can reject the qualitative results described above, the inclusion of
additional parameters drastically reduces the precision of most estimates, implying that there is only
so much that these data can tell (at least through these models).

In other words, the results implied

by Model 1 cannot be made more precise by additional modeling. A look at Tables 2 and 4 anew
suggests why we cannot hope for finer distinctions: the basic and overwhelming fact that any model
would have to accommodate is that IBM accounted for 6090 of the market (about 1 million unit sales
per year), and the bulk of those sales were in the (B, NF) cluster. By contrast, the average NB/NF
(clone) product sold less than 5,000 units/year. Thus, finer distinctions between non-IBM PCS lose
out to the stark contrast between IBM and the rest of the pack.

C. A GLIMPSE AT DEMAND CURVES FOR BRANDED AND FRONTIER

PRODUCTS

We noted above that the estimates of ~~w~~~~ is positive, large, and highly significant, that
~m~ is also positive, and that ~momm is negative and insigtilcant.

In order to gain further intuition

as to the meaning of these results, we take for a moment the point estimates

Figure 2 displays two

1987 demand curves, one associated with a typical IBM, Non-Frontier

PC, the other

with a typical Non-Branded, Frontier PC. One point on each demand curve is the actual average price
and quantities for these two typical products.

The other marked point on the demand curve for the

B3M/NF PC corresponds to the price at which the mean buyer’s valuation of an B3M~F

PC would

calculate the price that renders 8NB,F = bNB,NF.
The demand curves thus constructed make it clear that the main advantage of Frontier status,
at that very early stage in the diffusion of the 386, seems to have been a steep demand curve rather
than a large one (recall the argument in section 2 about the type of users that chose 386-based PCS
back then). The converse was true for IBM/Branded status. While we have not estimated equations
characterizing sellers’ behavior, these demand distinctions would explain why IBM chose to take the
bulk of its product differentiation advantage as higher quantities rather than as higher prices (recall
the rzegative coefficient on IBM in the hedonic pricing equation (Table 2)), whereas the pioneer
manufacturers of Frontier PCS took the reverse course. The two mechanisms of appropriability,

the

large demand curve and the steep one, were both at work in the industry, but within different PDs.

D.

COUNTERFACTUALS
In order to shed further light on the meaning of our findings, we present in Table 9 four

counterfactual exercises. In each we introduce a hypothetical new product into a particular cluster
and, using the estimates from Model 1, compute the changes in sales of other products that such entry
would induce. The main goal is to compare the effects of entry on sales of competing brands within
the same cluster, vis a vis the impact on sales in other clusters. We can thus provide a sense of the
degree of insulation from competition enjoyed by products in different clusters, as captured by the
substitution parameters

p~ and p~.

In each case, we introduce a hypothetical product with a value of 6
attractiveness)

(i.e. its expected

set equal to the mean value for that cluster.g9 Holding the 6s of all other products

fixed (which means in particular that we do not allow for any pricing responses to this entry), we
recompute the implied market shares for all products, including the outside good. We then calculate
the difference in sales for each product before and after the hypothetical introduction. Finally, we sum
over all products in each cluster to evaluate the competitive effect of entry across clusters. Consider
Table 9 (A), in which an average F/B product is introduced (with 5 = -5.2). The model predicts that
the sales of this hypothetical PC would total 8511 units, of which 5270 (61%) is “market-stealing”
from within the F/B cluster. Market-stealing

across clusters is significantly smaller, drawing 1700

additional units (20%). The remainder comes from the outside good, that is, from individuals who
had not purchased PCS before. In the last part of the table, 9(E), we show a simple market-stealing
segmentation statistic and its (linearized) standard error. The numerator is the percentage change in
unit sales of existing products within the cluster as a result of the entry experiment. This negative
number becomes

and as

This positive number increases with the importance of the product introduced.

These statistics confirm the importance of intracluster market stealing implied by the high level of
measured segmentation.

“~lhile the overwhelming result is that most of the market share of the hypothetical new
product comes from intracluster effects, examining the intercluster effects highlights the results of
the estimation. The first result is that the effect on the completely non-matching cluster (NF/NB vis
a vis F/B) is trivial (16 units).

Intercluster market-stealing

occurs almost exclusively among the

partially matching clusters (NF/B and F/NB). Moreover, while the effect in terms of unit quantities
is larger for the cluster which matches along the B dimension (NF/B, which loses 1350 units versus
303 units stolen from the F/NB cluster) the effect in terms of percentages is much larger for the
cluster which matches along the F dimension (F/NB, which loses over 1 percent of its unit sales,
whereas NF/B’s 1350 units represent just one tenth of one percent of total units sold).
A similar story (a large intracluster

effect, and intercluster

effects confined to partially

matching clusters) is told in each of the other hypothetical presented in Table 9. For example, a
hypothetical low-end clone (NF/NB) sells over 2,500 units, of which only31 are market-stealing
the Branded group (the B/F and B~F

from

clusters); an additional 75 are drawn from the F/NB cluster.

According to our counterfactuals and contrary to some widely held perceptions of this industry, these
clones posed little competitive threat to Branded and Frontier competitors.

VII.

CONCLUDING

REMARKS

For the last 15 years, the PC industry has been one of the most innovative sectors of the economy;
at the same time, it is one of the most competitive. Such conjunction of forces seems to fly in the face
of the intuition suggested by Arrow about the necessity of monopoly power in order to induce, and
indeed

pay for, costly and risky innovation.

quality-adjusted

Where do rents come from in a world where

prices fall at a rate of 25% per year, low-cost imitators keep driving prices ever

lower and new distribution channels eradicate the advantages of existing brand capital?
Motivated by a desire to identify the market origins of innovative rents, this paper develops
a simple discrete choice model that uses just aggregate data and can easily incorporate
knowledge

of the structure of the indust~.

We propose the Principles of Differentiation

drawing primarily from McFadden (1978) and Berry (1994).

prior
GEV,

Compared to Multi-Level nested

multinominallogit models, ours is not hierarchical; therefore, it does not constrain the cross-elasticities
of substitution to conform to a specific order of nesting.

30

In applying the model to the case of PCS during 1987 and 1988, we begin by noting that the
market exhibited two principles of differentiation, according to whether or not the firm could be
regarded as having a brand name, and to whether or not the product was at the technological frontier.
Much of what follows relies heavily on the above testable hypothesis: the model is structured
accordingly

(there are two key substitution parameters associated with these PDs); an important

subset of the instruments used are predicated on the assumption that these PDs are a good way of
slicing the market so as to capture the different degrees of competition faced by products in them;
further computations

using the estimates are designed so as to compare salient properties of the

demand functions facing products in different clusters, and to gauge inter-cluster market-stealing
effects.
The hypothesized PDs also offer a suitable framework to address the puzzles raised above:
even if the market as a whole is highly competitive, market segmentation may provide (temporary)
insulation from competition in certain clusters.

Developing a brand name and/or innovating at the

frontier can generate rents by increasing buyers’ willingness to pay; depending on the strength and
the heterogeneity of this increase, B or F products can have either large demand curves or be poor
substitutes for more mundane competitors. Indeed, our findings indicate that competition in the PC
market was by no means ail all encompassing phenomenon, but that it was largely localized within
clusters.

Further, having a brand name conferred a large advantage in the sense of shifting out the

demand function, whereas being early on at the technological frontier did not.
These results refer just to 1987 and 1988 and, given the rapid pace of change in the industry,
one should be wary of using them to interpret the evolution of the PC sector before and after, Yet
one inference stands out as eminently plausible: contrary to widely-held perceptions, the demise of
B3M as the paramount leader in this industry seems to have been caused not by relentless competitive
pressures

from clones, but rather by the erosion of IBM’s quasi-monopoly

stand within its own

cluster, first by Compaq, then by other entrepreneurial firms that invested heavily on developing a
brand name, and in some cases also positioning themselves at the frontier.
The specific, two-way grouping postulated here is just a starting point for what we believe
is an appropriate representation of the PC market at the time. Other industries, and perhaps even the
PC sector itself at a different time, would require different ways of structuring and grouping the

competing products and firms. Indeefi, it seems that product differentiated markets very rarely, if at
all, consist just of an amorphous collection of n different products produced by m firms. Rather,
they appear to be structured according to a few principles of differentiation, which relate in turn to
a corresponding

menu of strategies opened to firms. A systematic study of those principles, of the

way they differ across markets, and of their dynamics seems to be a promising and exciting line of
research in empirical Industrial Organization.

Dataset Methodology and Sources
I.

PC DATASET CONSTRUCTION METHODOLOGY
We arrived at the sample of make/models used in the analysis by a process of elimination
according to the following criteria. First, we restricted ourselves to products sold by the top 25
vendors of PCs (see Table 1), and eliminated makes for which the number of units sold was less
than 300 (approximately equivalent to sales of $ 1,000,000). This eliminates a substantial number
of very small IBM clones, but each of these small vendors accounted for a very small fraction of
the business market at the time. In fact, over 90~o of the total number of PCs sold in 1987 and
1988 were marketed by the top 25 vendors. Secondly, we constrained the sample to PCs based
on Intel microprocessors (the IaPX 80x86 family), including “close” variation from AMD, NEC,
etc. The principal alternative microprocessor (Motorola’s 68000 family) was incorporated into
computers marketed primarily by Apple. 1 These computers were only distant substitutes to
Intel-based machines at this time.2 Finally, we eliminated makes/models for which we could not
obtain reliable data on prices andor characteristics.
II.

DATA ON PRICES AND CHAR4CTERISTICS
Unfortunately there is no single data source which provides consistent and reliable
information about the price and characteristics of marketed PCs. Thus, we had to rely on a
variety of sources, and invested a great deal of effort in trying to establish consistency and
comparability. The primary data source for this purpose was the GML MicroComputer Guide, a
quarterly publication which provides list prices and technical characteristics of all PC’s marketed.
The GML data was complemented and confirmed with an extensive set of additional primary and
secondary data sources. These included 1987 and 1988 back issue catalogues and company
histories (provided directly by vendors) and a number of contemporary surveys in
ComputerWorld, Data Sources, PC World, and PC Technical Journal. Finally, a complementary
dataset with prices and characteristics of marketed PCs was graciously provided by Zvi Griliches
and Ernie Bemdt (see Bemdt and Griliches (1993)). In order to be included in the sample, a
complete and matched set of prices and characteristics needed to be identified in the GML data
or in two or more of the additional sources. For many, if not most, of the observations, we were
able to identify at least two mutually consistent sources.3

1 There were also a small number of PCs (mostly concentrated at the very low or very high
end of the quality dimension) which were based on other microprocessors (HP workstations,
Commodore PETs, etc.). We excluded them as well from the sample.
2 Graphics and marketing people tended to purchase Apple technology, whereas accounting,
manufacturing, and sales management tended to buy IBM. We experimented with including
Apple as an additional Branded firm in the context of nested logit models, but this made little
qualitative difference to the estimates. However, we have not conducted such experiments in the
context of the PD GEV model.
3 For a small number of observations, we observed sales in both years but price in only one
year. When this occurred, we imposed a price depreciation rate of 10% between the two years.
