UNRAVELING

IN ASSIGNMENT

MARKETS

ABSTRACT

We present a two-period model of the assignment market with uncertainty in the first period
regarding productive characteristics

of participants.

This model is used to understand incentives

toward early contracts or unraveling in labor markets for entry-level professionals.

We study two

contractual situations, one where firms are bound by ex post unsuccessful early contracts, and the
other where they can buy out of unsuccessful early contracts.

The economic benefit of unraveling

is to provide insurance in the absence of complete markets, but it can come at the cost of inefficient
assignments.

Without reentry, unraveling need not occur. It is more likely, the smaller the applicant

pool or the proportion

of more promising applicants in the pool, and the greater the degree of

heterogeneity in the pool. A ban on early contracts always hurts firms and benefits less promising
applicants,

but the welfare effects on more promising applicants depends on how the gains from

early contracts

are shared.

With buyouts, inefficiencies

in assignments

unraveling always occurs between firms and the more promising applicants.

are eliminated,

The efficiency gains

of buyouts can be distributed unevenly and sometimes firms benefit from a ban on buyouts.
