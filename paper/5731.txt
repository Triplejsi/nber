PRIVATE CONSUMPTION,

NON-TRADED

GOODS AND REAL EXCHANGE RATE:
A COINTEGRATION-EULER
EQUATION
APPROACH

ABS TRACT

This paper presents an empirical study of real exchange rate movements from a consumer’s
perspective.

Trade between two countries creates a link between real exchange rate and terms of

trade. It is the private consumption of non-traded goods that induces an equilibrium relationship
between real exchange rate and private consumption of traded and non-traded goods. We use Ogaki
and Park’s (1989) cointegration-Euler equation approach to explore long-run implications from the
equilibrium relationship. Given the stationary preference shocks assumption, the testable restriction
is that real exchange rate and private consumption of traded and non-traded goods in the home and
foreign countries are cointegrated. The empirical evidence suggests that private consumption in the
home and foreign countries accounts for a significant fraction of the long run movements of real
exchange rate in South Korea and Taiwan. Accounting for real government consumption does not
overturn the result.
