TRADE AND GROWTH IN EAST ASIAN
COUNTRIES: CAUSE AND EFFECT?

ABSTRACT
Estimates of growth equations have found a role for openness, particularly in explaining rapid
growth among East Asian countries. But major concerns of simultaneous causality between growth
and trade have been expressed,

This study aims to deal with the endogeneity of trade by using as

instrumental

variables the exogenous determinants from the gravity model of bilateral trade, such

as proximity

to trading partners.

We find that the effect of openness on growth is even stronger

when we correct for the endogeneity of openness than in standard OLS estimates. We conclude with
estimates

of how much has been contributed

to East Asian growth both by the exogenous

geographical component of openness and by the residual or policy component.

The record of rapid growth that many East Asian countries have attained over the last
three decades is so spectacular that it has been claimed as supporting evidence by both sides in
each of three debates (at least), First is the debate on whether the East Asians’ success is proof
of the superiority of protectionist policies on the one hand, or of outward-oriented
other.

Second is the broad debate whether the East Asian phenomenon

policies on the

is evidence of the virtues

of government intervention in general, or of laissez-faire market-oriented

policies. 1 Third is the

debate over whether the statistics support growth based on simple accumulation

of the factors of

production (labor, education, and especially physical capital), or grow-th based on improvements
in technology and efficiency (measured as an increase in total factor productivity,

or the “SO1OW

residual’’).z Finally, in the latter case, there would also be the question whether this increase in
technical efficiency was due (i) to superior government policies, in which case East Asia may
have valuable lessons for other countries, (ii) to some superior mode of social organization,

‘ Examples include Krueger (1990) vs. Pack and Westphal (1986), or the controversy
surrounding World Bank (1993), including Rodrik (1994a). Laissez-faire is not the same as
outward-orientation,
of course, because some governments deliberately use subsidies or an
undervalued currency to promote outward orientation.
2 Young (1992, 1994, 1994), Kim and Lau (1994), and Krugman (1994) have upset
conventional wisdom by arguing that growth among the four East Asian dragons, especially
Singapore, can be explained by simple factor accumulation, with no important residual left over
in most cases. Sarel (1995) reviews the state of play.

The main
problem with the chance argument is that the East Asian success stories are all located in the
same region. These authors point out that this ex post reasoning has some pitfalls. Nevertheless,
this observed spatial correlation is a major motivation for the present paper.

spillovers could come via imports as easily as exports.
Quite a few empirical studies of growth rates across countries find that the ratio of exports
to GDP, or some other measure of openness, is a significant determinant of growth5, and ofien
that it is an important determinant for East Asian countries in particular,b

A typical specification

begins with the standard determinants of GDP suggested by neoclassical growth theory, and adds
a variable for exports as a share of GDP. For example, Feder (1982) regresses growth rates for
31 semi-industrialized

countries over the period 1964-1973 against three variables: investment as

a share of income, the rate of growth of the labor force, and the rate of gro~h
exports

as a share of income).

Edwards (1993, pp,9-11) regresses the rate of growth of total factor

on two measures of openness -- total trade as a percent of GDP and total tariff

revenue as a per cent of trade -- along with some other variables,

and finds that “in every

regression the proxies for trade distortions and openness are highly significant. ”

5 Examples include Michaely (1977), Krueger (1978), Feder (1982), Kohli and Singh
(1989), Romer (1989), Quah and Rauch (1990), de Melo and Robinson (1991), DeLong and
Summers (199 1), Dollar (1992), Edwards (1993a), van den Berg and Schmidt (1994), Sachs and
Warner (1995, p.35-37), Harrison (1995), and Eusufmi (1996). Edwards (1993b) and Rodrik
(1993) survey the literature.
fi Five examples are Helliwell (1992, 1995), Page (1994), Pack and Page (1994), and
Fukuda and Toya (1995). Pack and Page find that manufactured exports, in particular, are
important in the growth equation, and that this variable explains part of the East Asian success
(and that its coefficient is the same as for other parts of the world). Bradford (1 994) surveys the
literature.

“Does growth drive trade, or is there a reverse link from trade to growth?”

Harrison (1 995, 9.26)

Quite a few stories of reverse causality are possible.

What if

free-market trade policies are no more important to growth than free-market domestic policies,
but tend to be correlated with them?

Then openness will be observed to be correlated with

growth, even though trade does not cause growth,

A final possible mechanism

is a pattern

whereby poor countries tend to depend fiscally on tariff revenue, and to reduce tariffs as they
become more developed.

This paper offers tests with such instruments:

predicted by the gravity model. The gravity model of bilateral trade, in its most basic form, says
that trade between country i and country j is proportional to the product of GDPi and GDPj, and
inversely related to the distance between them, by analogy to Newton’s theory of gravitational
attraction between two masses.

While the

gravity model has long been’ an ugly duckling of international economics -- obscure and allegedly
lacking theoretical foundations -- it has recently enjoyed a swan-like revival.

There are at least

three reasons for that revival: its empirical success at predicting bilateral trade flows, improved

5
theoretical foundations arising from modem theories of trade based on imperfect substitutes, and
a new interest among economists in geography and bade that seeks to treat countries or regions
as physically existing at particular locations in space rather than as disembodied

constructs.9

Such variables as distances, populations, common borders, and common languages are as
close to exogenous as we get in economics.

From the viewpoint of a small individual country,

the GDPs of trading partners are exogenous as well.’” Yet these variables are highly correlated
with trade. Thus they make good instrumental variables,

An intuitive way to implement the idea

is to use the values predicted by the gravity model to instrument for the trade variable in the
growth equation.

If trade still appears to be a significant

determinant

of growth with this

correction (taking care, of course, to use the right standard errors), then we can conclude that the
effect is causal and not spurious,

9 The results of one early gravi~ study were reported in Limeman (1967).
The
theoretical rationale for the idea that bilateral trade depends on the product of GDPs comes from
recent work by Helpman (1987) and Helpman and Krugman (1985, section 1.5). Frankel (1996)
elaborates, applies the gravity model to issues of trade blocs tests for trade blocs, and gives
ftiher references. Frankel (1993) and Frankel and Wei (1994) focus on East Asian blocs.
‘0 For a study like this one that seeks to explain growth for a cross-section of countries,
one does not wish to treat GDPs of trading partners as exogenous, even if the domestic country
is small. But if the standard factor-accumulation
terms in a growth regression (labor force
growth, investment, and education) can be treated as exogenous in the domestic country, then
they can also be considered exogenous in trading partners, as discussed below.

Or, on the other hand,

to put it simply, is it just that they are lucky enough to be located near each other?
Somewhat

relevant to this idea are tests in a number of recent papers.

DeLong and

Summers tested for spatial correlation of residuals in their growth regression, and (surprisedly and
surprisingly)

failed to find any correlation based on physical proximity.

Chua (1993), on the

other hand, finds “strong evidence for positive regional spillovers, accounting for about 14 to 18

however, do not focus specifically on trade.

They measure spatial proximity by simple dummy

variables for common border or common regions, rather than using the fill set of variables
known to be useful in the gravity literature,

As a result, the regional spillover effects found by

Chua and Elliott could be due to many possible channels, whereas ours can be specifically
identified with trade links. 11

“ Weinhold (1995) has recently extended the approach of these papers, to focus on
differences in spatial dependence between industrialized and developing countries, making some
use of the gravity equation.. Moreno and Trehan (1996) argue that proximity matters for more
reasons than just trade.

One possible strategy is

a version of the equation that includes ~, with a coefficient constrained

A second strategy is to drop trading partner incomes from the explanatory variables in the gravity
model.

This is not an entirely attractive solution either, because income is such an important

variable in the gravity model; but the outcome of such estimation of the growth equation using
purely “geographic” instrumental

variables is reported anyway in column 2 of Table 2. A third

strategy, our preferred one, is to substitute for ~ in the trade equation the fitted values of the
partner income levels, based on the factor terms, (l,~j, nj, and SCHJ.

‘4 Estimates such as many of those reported in Frankel (1996) support this constraint.
Cyrus (1996) allows for the endogeneity of income in estimates of the gravity model, by using
the factor accumulation variables as instruments.

10
The predicted trade share for country i is the sum of the predicted bilateral trade shares
with all of its partners:

The sum is taken not just over the 63 countries for which we have bilateral trade data, but over
162 countries, virtually the entire world. (The growth regressions concentrate on a medium-sized
data set of 123 countries, however, because these are the ones for which we have the necessary
data on factor accumulation.

An Appendix table A-11 lists them.”)

It is a good idea to inspect the first-stage regressions, to make arI assessment of the quality
of the instruments.

These are reported in Appendix Table A-4. In the full gravity model, the

correlation between the fitted trade shares and actual trade shares is quite high. When the trading
partners’ GDPs are excluded, but populations and areas are included, the fitted trade shares still
have a relatively high correlation with actual trade shares: 0.66.

The t-statistic in a regression

of the actual trade share on the fitted share is 9.5.
In Frankel and Romer (1 995, Table 2), which reports the estimates of equation (2) in full,
it is argued that for use in the growth equation, we are only interested in exogenous components
of openness excluding

the size of the domestic country.

Holding constant for the area and

model of openness is only 3,2.)

To allow for zero-values in bilateral trade data, we also tried using Tobit in the

Implications

for Trade-Led Growth Among Ten East Asian Countries

The next step is to examine individual

East Asian countries

(particularly

those with

positive TFP growth residuals), and so see how much of their growth can be explained by the
estimated effect of trade.

20 We noted earlier an argument that one should condition on country size, as measured
by area and population, when observing the effects of openness on growth. In tests of this sort,
the standard error of the coefficient on openness is increased, so that its t-statistic falls to 1.7,
though the point estimate is little affected. (When initial income per capita is excluded from the
equation, openness remains statistically significant at the 95 percent level even when conditioning
on country size.) These results are reported in Frankel and Romer (1995), Table 5.

The results are reported in Table 5. We see that openness explains a large amount of

As in the Young (1992) results, the residual for Singapore is very small (actually

substantially negative).

cases, the contribution of openness to growth is a contribution of trade as predicted by the gravity
model; thus it camot be attributed to policies.

We see that for Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan,

the helpful effect of openness is fully predicted by the gravity model, leaving nothing as a
residual.

For Singapore and Malaysia, on the other hand, the contribution of predicted openness

is smaller than the contribution of residual openness, presumably attributable to outward-oriented
policies.

In some of the cases where a level of openness less than the global average held back

growth, a low level of residual openness was a more important component than was predicted
openness.

This describes China, Japan, the Philippines

and Thailand.23

To summarize the results briefly, many of the explanations offered for East Asian growth
indeed appear to play an important

role: simple catch-up (particularly

Several extensions of the research are desirable.

In the results reported here, we do not

But it seems likely that this residual openness is in part due to the rapid factor

such an equation might allow us to distinguish

recent theory such as Grossman-Helpman

Among other advantages,

whether the spillover effects from neighbors’

assumed, or imports, as might be implied by some
(1991a, 199 lb).24

Another possible extension

for

future research would be to attempt explicit tests that distinguish the importance of rapid growth
among close trading partners from other determinants

of trade.

Our current conclusion, however, is that the role played by opemess in promoting growth
turns out to stand up well to the simultaneity

charges that have been leveled against it.

24 Coe and Helpman (1993) test the theory, and find that TFP is affected not only by
domestic R & D, but also by R & D of those countries from whom the domestic country imports
a lot.

Note: The dependent variable is ln(Ti/GDPi) in 1985. Population indicates the working-age population
in 1985. In the IV regression, fitted GDP per capita from a Mankiw-Romer-Weil-style factoraccumulation regression is used as an instrument for actual GDP per capita. The “smaller sample”
includes the countries in Frankel-Romer plus China and Taiwan. Standard errors are reported in
parentheses.

Note: The dependent variable is log GDP per worker in 1985. Averages are for the period 1960 to 1985.

Inv is the average share of investment in GDP. Pop Growth is the average growth in the working-age
population (plus 0.05, as in Mankiw-Romer-Weil, to account for technological progress and depreciation).
School is the average secondary school enrollment ratio. In the IV regressions, predicted openness from
the bilateral trade equations is used as an instrument for actual openness. Standard errors are reported in
parentheses.
