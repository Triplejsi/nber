ABSTRACT

This paper estimates the NAIRU (standing for the ~on-~ccelerating

rate that

Its value is determined in an econometric model in

which the inflation rate depends on its own past values (“inertia”), demand shocks proxied by the
difference between the actual unemployment

rate and the estimated NAIRU, and a set of supply

shock variables.
The estimated NAIRU for the U.S. economy differs somewhat for alternative measures of
the inflation rate. The NAIRU estimated for the GDP deflator varies over the past forty years within
the narrow range of 5.7 to 6.4 percent; its estimated value for the most recent quarter(1996:Q1)
5.7 percent. In that quarter a lower NAIRU of 5.3 percent is obtained for the chain-weighted
deflator. Recent research claiming that there is a three-percentage-point

and early 1990s.

More than 35 years ago Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow (1960) coined

the term “Phillips curve” at the 1959 AEA meetings, reacting promptly

to the publication

of

Phillips’s seminal (1958) article.

A few years later Milton Friedman

“natural rate of unemployment,”

which more recently has come to be known by the familiar

acronym

“NAIRU,” standing for the ~on-&ccelerating

1. Even though the actual unemployment rate averaged 5.6 percent in the 21 months ending
in May, 1996, below the Fed’s previous NAIRU estimate of 6.0 percent, the inflation rate did not
accelerate. Indeed, one key measure of inflation, the personal consumption deflator (on the new
chain-weighted basis) decelerated. The implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures
on the new chain-weighted basis rose 2.7 percent in 1992, 2.6 percent in 1993, 2.4 percent in 1994,
2.4 percent in 1995, and only 1.9 percent in the four quarters ending in 1996:Q1.

2. The inflation equation was developed in a series of papers, including Gordon (1970,
1975, 1977a, and 1982b).
King-Watson (1994) have called this approach the “Gordon-Solow
model,” citing the first of my papers and Solow’s 1969 book. In order to determine whether the
inflation relationship has changed, I have maintained unchanged the set of variables, lag lengths, and
other features of the equation introduced in Gordon (1982b) and Gordon-King (1982). The most
recent assessments of the performance of this equation are contiined in Gordon (1990a, 1994).

6. “More specifically, in a reduced form vector autoregression, past unemployment is
important for predicting current inflation but past inflation contains little information about current
unemployment” (King-Watson, 1994, p. 161).
7. While early work on the Phillips curve focussed on wage behavior, and required a “markup” equation to relate inflation to wage changes, it has proven more useful since the mid-1970s to
estimate a reduced-form equation in which inflation is directly related to unemployment, thus
eliminating the need to be concerned with the two-way links between wages and prices. A complete
set of wage equations for both the U. S, and for Germany, estimated with the same specification as
in this paper, can be found in Franz-Gordon (1993). That paper determined that the U. S. wage
NAIRU for 1990 was 6.2 percent, almost exactly the same as estimated in this paper for the GDP
deflator by the time-varying approach described below.

Rate of Change Effects
In previous

research I have found that wage and price change depend

on both the

level and change in the demand variable, i.e., the output gap or unemployment

gap.a The

role of the change effect is automatically

allowed

to enter as long as the gap variable is

entered with more than one lag. For instance, if the gap variable is entered as the current
value and one lagged value and the coefficients are estimated as -0.5 and +0.3, respectively,
then this is identically

equal to an equation

of the gap are entered

separately,

in which the current level and current change

of -0.2 and -0.3.

In light of

the high statistical significance of the change effect in the results discussed below, time-series

11. The only smoothing structure imposed on the lag distributions involves the lagged
dependent variable, where 24 lagged terms enter. Rather than estimating 24 unconstrained
coefficients, the lagged dependent variable is entered as a series of four-quarter moving averages of
rates of change, e.g., the first variable is a four-quarter average of lags t-1 to t-4, the next t-5 through
t-9, etc. The coefficients on the individual moving averages are unconstrained. Exclusion tests
indicate that the moving averages representing lags 13 through 24 enter with a significance level of
between 1 and 2 percent in the two equations displayed in Table 1 for the sample periods 1955-96
and are thus highly significant.
12. The food-energy effect is defined as the difference of the rate of change of the chainweighted consumption deflator minus the rate of change of the chain-weighted consumption deflator
net of food and energy. Chain-weighted deflators are available back to 1959 and are linked to the
implicit deflator prior to 1959.
