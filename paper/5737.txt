September 1996
CRIME, URBAN FLIGHT, AND THE
CONSEQUENCES FOR CITIES
ABSTRACT

This paper demonstrates that rising crime rates in cities are correlated with city depopulation.
Instrumental variables estimates, using measures of the certainty and severity of a state’s criminal
justice system as instruments for city crime rates, imply that the direction of causality runs from
crime to urban flight. Using annual city-level panel data, our estimates suggest that each additional
reported crime is associated with a one person decline in city residents. There is some evidence that
increases in suburban crime tend to keep people in cities, although the magnitude of this effect is
small.

Analysis of individual-level

data from the 1980 census confirms the city-level results and

demonstrates that almost all of the crime-related population decline is attributable to increased outmigration

rather than a decrease in new arrivals to a city. Those households that leave the city

because of crime are much more likely to remain within the SMSA than those leaving the city for
other reasons. The migration decisions of high-income households and those with children are much
more responsive to changes in crime than other households.

Crime-related mobility imposes costs

on those who choose to remain in the city through declining property values and a shrinking tax
base.
