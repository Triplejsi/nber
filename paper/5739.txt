MACROECONOMIC POLICY IN THE
PRESENCE OF STRUCTURAL
MALADWSTMENT
ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes two-way interactions between structural reform and macro policy. If
structural reforms increase the flexibility of labor markets, they are likely to improve the short-run
inflation-unemployment tradeoff, providing an incentive for policymakers to expand aggregate
demand. In turn, the promise by policymakers that they will encourage a decline in unemployment
in response to good news on inflation can be used to strike a political deal with political interests
opposed to the introduction or extension of structural reform. Expansionary monetary policy also
provides relief on the fiscal front, directly by bringing the actual budget deficit closer to the
structural budget deficit, and indirectly, by encouraging structural reform, potentially reducing the
structural budget deficit itself.
In 1992-93 several European countries dropped out of the ERM to pursue more expansionary
monetary policies. The difference in the performance of these countties and those countries which
maintained a peg between their currencies and the Deutsche mark provides an important test case
of the consequences of expansionary monetary policy. The depreciating nations by 1995 enjoyed
a substantial relative acceleration of nominal GDP and, surprisingly, an even greater deceleration
of inflation, so that their growth rate of real GDP accelerated more than their growth rate of nominal
GDP in relation to the pegging countries. The continued deceleration of inflation in the depreciating
countries provides evidence that their natural unemployment rate has declined and that expansionary
monetary policy has interacted beneficially with structural reform.
