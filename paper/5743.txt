CAPITAL MOBILITY

THE SAVING-~VESTMENT
RELATIONSHIP

ABSTRACT

Economic historims have been concerned with the evolution of international capital markets
over the long run, but empirical testing of market integration has been limited. This paper augments
the literature by investigating long- and short-run criteria for capital mobility using time-series and
cross-section analysis of saving-investment correlation for twelve countries since 1850. The results
present a nuanced picture of capital market evolution. The sample shows considerable cross-country
heterogeneity. Broadly speaking, the inter-war period, and especially the Great Depression, emerge
as an era of diminishing capital mobility, and only recently can we observe a tentative return to the
degree of capital mobility witnessed during the late nineteenth century.

Introduction

Although economic historians have long been concerned with the evolution of
international capital markets over the long run, empirical testing of market
integration criteria has been limited. The conventional wisdom suggests that
latenineteenth century capital markets were relatively well integrated under
the classic gold standard centered on London; that the inter-war period was
one of disintegration and imperfect capital mobility, wpecially after 1929;
and that the postwar period h= been characterized by gradually increasing
capital market integration. This paper seeks to confront and test such hypotheses using quantity criteria on the saving-investment relationship applied
to the longest and broadest panel data sets assembled for this purpose.
The evolution of international capital mobility is, in principle, closely
tied to the trends and cycles in foreign lending. Yet the presence of flows, is
neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for market integration: a small
autarkic country with capital scarcity no different from the “world” market
will exhibit no incipient flows upon opening itself to capital flows. Conversely,
countries with substantial barriers to capital mobility may nonetheless experience capital flows of some sort provided international

rate-of-return

dif-

ferentials are sufficiently large, Here, then, is the handicap of using quantity
rather than price criteria as yardsticks of market integration.
Is there any logic to wing quantity criteria at all? First, price criteria are
not without problems. They are intense in data requirements, and studies
need to focus on identzwl wets in different markets, such as the onshoreoffshore price differential on a given asset-and,
in practice, such data series are few (Obstfeld 1994). Second, quantity criteria do bear on certain
predictions of economic theory. For example, presumptions of consumptionsmoothing preferences can be twted by looking at quantity data on consumption and income across time, to see whether income shocks are adequately
smoothed away: that is, whether international risk-sharing functions sat isfactorily. Of course, income minus comurnption is equal to saving, so this is
not unrelated to the saving-investment criterion, which instead =ks whether
shocks to investment are constrained by local saving supply, or whether they
are met by the global pool of capital. Thus, despite shortcomings, a substantial literatme has evolved using quantity criteria for evaluating capital
mobility. A seminal contribution was that of Feldstein and Horioka (FH)
(1980) which used data for the 1960s and 1970s on savings and investment
rates to assess whether incremental savings were retained in the home coun2

try or else entered the global capital market seeking out the highest return.
This paper develops and extends the historical application of the FH approach (and its subsequent refinements), and seeks to extend the empirical
framework and historical scope of the analysis in several ways.
It is natural to ask what exogenous or endogenous changes in policy,
institutions or market structure might have implied for capital mobility.
By applying the criteria in different time periods, corresponding to major
changes in policy regimes, I can begin to attack the question. I also re~sess
the methodology applied to evaluate capital mobility criteria, subjecting the
Feldstein-Horioka t-t in historical application to further scrutiny. I am able
to apply not just the traditional FH estimator, but also panel tests of pooling,
and comparisons with time-series wtimates derived from a recently proposed
error-correction model of the saving-investment relationship. My tests have
enhanced power compared to other historical studies, since I increase the
sample size: I use annual data for the Ml period 1850 to the present, and
I increase the cross-section size from the usual nine or ten up to twelve, by
including an important capital receiving region of the late nineteenth century, Argentina, an important capital exporter of the late nineteenth century,
France, and a major recent capital exporter, Japan. 1
I contrast the results of standard tests of long-run capital mobilit y (savinginvwtment correlations in cross section) and alternative tests of short-run
capital mobility (saving-investment correlations in time series), and conclude
that the two approaches offer helpful and complementary insights into the
evolution of the “world” capital market, In the end, a consistent story of
international capital market evolution can be told. The results present a
more nuanced picture of capital market evolution: in the Feldstein-Horioka
sense, the long-run capital-mobility parameters exhibit considerable fluctuation across time; and the short-run parameters evolve very differently in the
several sample countries studied.
1As noted eLsewhere, on a relative scale, Argentina was the New World region most
dependent on capital imports under the classic gold standard, with about half the capital
stock foreign-owned cira 1914, a figure far in excess of any other country before or since,
and a situation which made sustained growth extremely vulnerable to international
capital
market disruption (Diaz-Alejandro
1970; Taylor 1992; Taylor 1994b).

Capital Flows in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries

As noted, analysis of the saving-investment

relationship is closely tied to the

study of the pattern of capital flows, by dint of the saving-investment

identity.

Some definitions and notation will now prove useful. To simplify, we may
define gross national product Q as the sum of goods produced, which, with
imports M, may be allocated to private comurnption C, public comumption
G, invwtment 1, or export X, so that Q + M = C+ 1 + G + X. Rearranging,
GNP is given by
(1)
GNP EQ=C+I+G+NX,
where NX = X – M is net exports.

If the country’s net credit (debt) position

vis-h-vis the rest of the world is B (– B), and these claims (debts) earn (pay)
interest at a world interest rate r, then gross domestic product is GNP plus
(minus) this net factor income from (to) the rest of the world,
GDP=

CA satisfies

where S s Y – C – G is gross national saving, 2 Finally, the dynamic structure

This study will focus on the patterns of saving (S), investment (1), and
the current account (CA) as defined above. The buic identity CA = S – I
is central to my analysis. In terms of historical data collection, it proves
essential to utilize the identity to measure saving residually, as S = 1 + CA,

because no national accounts before the 1940s present independent saving
estimates, only investment and current-account data. In terms of econ~
metrics, however, this procedure may also introduce biases (via errors in
variables) in the traditional cross-section correlation analysis which must be
considered, In terms of theory, the long-run constraints on current-account
balance (a “n~Ponzi-game”
condition) have suggested to numerous scholars
the inevitability of an equilibrium level of CA, inviting the innovative use
of a dynamic

time-series model of saving and investment in the historical

setting with the present sample.
Since the current account is so central to the analysis it is worth spending
a moment to look at the long-run behavior of capital flows in my sample. A
sense of the changing patterns of international financial flows can be gleaned
by examining their trends and cycles. This could be taken to mean the
absolute quantity of the capital flows themselves, but it is more informative
to normalize by country size. Measurement traditionally focusw on the size of
the current account balance CA, equal to net foreign investment, ~ a fraction
of national income Y. Thus (CA/ Y)it becomes the variable of interest, for
country i in period t.
Table 1 and Figure 1 prwent the basic trends in foreign capital flows.
Two measures of the extent of capital flows are used, both of which measure
the cross-sectional dispersion of (CA/Y)it for fixed t. First, the variance
u~~/Y,t; second, the mean absolute value PICA/Yl,t. Quinquennially averaged
data are wed throughout, and the years covered for each country are shown
in Table 2.
Both measura show similar patterm mross time. Consider #l~A/Yl. The
average size of capital flows in this sample was often x high as 4Y0–570 of
national income before World War I. At its first peak it reached 4.670 in the
overseas investment boom of the late 1880s. This dropped back to around 3%
in the depression of the 1890s. The figure approached 4% again in 19 10–14,
and wartime lending pushed the figure over 570 in 1915–19. Flows diminished
in size in the 1920s, however, and international capital flows were less than
1.5% of national income in the late 1930s, Again, wartime loans raised the
figure in the 1940s, but in the 1950s and 1960s, the size of international
capital flows in this sample reached an all time low, around 1YOof national
income. Only in the late 1970s and 1980s have flows incre~ed, though not
to levels above those of a century ago.
Of course, mere flow data, as a quantity criterion, servm only as weak
evidence of changing market integration. The presence of flows may be guar5

anteed despite considerable barriers to mobility, if return differentials are
sufficiently large; conversely, the absence of flows may just reflect similarities
in rates of return, even in the context of two perfectly integrated markets.
However, these basic descriptive tables and figures do illustrate the record
of capital flows, and offer ptima facie evidence that the globalization of the
capital market has been subject to major dislocations, most notably the
inter-war period, with a dramatic contraction of flows seen in the Depr-sion
of the 1930s. Moreover, this low level in the volume of flows persisted long
into the postwar era. We now turn to more formal tests to see whether this
description, and the conventional history of world markets that points to the
Depr~sion as an era of disintegration, has broader support.

The Saving-Investment Relationship in History

The starting point for the quantity-based criteria used to assess capital mobility in this paper is the seminal paper by Feldstein and Horioka (1980),
which proposed saving-investment correlations as a me~ure of international
capital mobility. Feldstein and Horioka reasoned that, in a world of perfectly
mobile capital, domestic savings would seek out the highest returns in the
world capital market independent of local investment demand, and by the
same token the world capital market would cater to domestic investment
needs independent of domestic savings supply.
Thus, Feldstein and Horioka expected to find low correlations of domestic
saving and investment rates among developed countries given the conventional wisdom that international capital markets were well integrated by the
1960s and 1970s. In a surprising and provocative result, they discovered a
high and significant investment-saving correlation in regressions of the form
(l/Y)i
= a+ b(S/Y)i + u;, with b typically close to unity (the samples being
a cross section of OECD countries with 5-year period averaging). It appeared
that changes in domestic saving p~sed through almost fully into domestic
investment, suggesting imperfect international capital mobility.
Feldstein and Horioka coined the term “savings-retention coefficient” to
describe the regression coefficient b. Their finding of a large and significant
coefficient has been replicated many times for various cross-section and timeseries sampl~ wing post-World War Two and historical data, so much so as

6

to be now considered a robust result-a stylized fact, as it were (Dornbusch
1991; Feldstein and Bacchetta 1991; Frankel 1991; Obstfeld 1991; Tesar 1991;
Sinn 1992).
Cm such results be replicated for longer historical periods of a century
or more? Are the rmdts semitive to the period or countries studied? And
how can one interpret the result an~ay?
In this section, I begin with a
discussion of the antecedent empirical literature, and then move on to the
many methodological controversies surrounding this test. I then briefly discuss my data sources. In a new section I apply the traditional FH test, and
subject the specification to various empirical checks. In another section I
then explore an alternative time-series approach.

3.1

Antecedent Historical Literature

Some applications of the Feldstein-Horioka approach in economic history,
the natural antecedents of this paper, therefore warrant mention. Bayoumi
(1989) applied the Feldstein-Horioka approach to the classic gold-standard
period before 1914 for a sample of eight countries. His finding that the fit was
poorer, and the correlation lower, than for contemporary data, suggested that
capital markets might well have been better integrated in the latenineteenth
century than today. Similar findings were also shown by Zevin (1992), using
data for eight countries, in a study which merged price and quantity criteria to evaluate financial openness in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
Zevin’s b was no higher than 0,51 for decades from the 1870s to the 1920s,
certainly no higher than the me~urements
1960s and 1970s.3

of the same coefficient

for the

Of course, such samples only included eight countries, with imperfect
data in many c~es, a reflection of the scant historical statistics on national
accounts and balance of payments for more than a handful of countries,
Bayoumi’s data excluded the United States for what seemed like arbitrary
reasons, drawing criticism from, and prompting a reevaluation by, Eichengreen (1990). Eichengreen concluded that Bayoumi’s conclusions were not
so robust: the long-run correlations were typically different from zero at conventional significance levels, except for the 1902–1913 period. However, the
3Bayoumi’s sample included Australia,
Canada,
Sweden, U.K and used data from Mitchell. Zevin’s

size of the coefficient did seem markedly smaller during the pre-1914 period
(in the range 0.5-0.7), smaller than the near-unity coefficients of the 1920s
and 1930s, the 1960s and 1970s.4
However, the conventional view that the inter-war period marked a significant curtaihnent in capital mobility was not overturned.
Eichengreen
suggested that it was not the gold standard per se that facilitated high cap
ital mobility, arguing that the restored gold standard was not qualitatively
different from its classic predecessor.

Rather, government policy was possibly

responsible: the restored gold standard was overseen by governments with
radically changed objectives: discouraging overseas lending and intervening
in the capital market to an extent not seen before 1914. It remains to be
seen how this conclusion holds for a broader sample of countries and a longer
span of data.

3.2

Methodological Controversies

Still, we might ask, what does the FH coefficient mean and how do we measure it accurately? As noted in the survey by Obstfeld (1994), the FeldsteinHorioka criterion, despite the attention it has commmded and its widespread
use, is handicapped by two distinct sets of problems: First, do the regressions of invwtment on saving measure true and unbiased “savings retention”?
Second, even if estimated accurately, what does the coefficient say about international capital mobility? These problems may be thought of as issues of
implementation and interpretation.
On implementation, several issues arise. First, the b~ic choice of econometric specification for estimating b: should one adopt annual time-series
estimation for one country, or cross-section estimation for several countries
during a set period (or should one even employ the occasionally attempted
panel estimation)? This particular implementation question is also an interpretation question: given differences in sampling frequency, the time-series
estimates of b are thought to have a “natural” interpretation as measures
of short-run capital mobility, whilst the cross-section estimates of b, if for a
sufficiently long period (usually five to ten years in the literature), are given

ond, what of the possibility of omitted variable bias? For the cross-section
specifications, several plausible theoretical models suggest that growth, demographic structure, relative prices, taxes, government behavior, productivityy shocks, and other variables might simultaneously affect both saving
and investment and produce a spurious correlation in the simple FeldsteinHoriob bivariate regrwsion (Obstfeld 1986; Summers 1988; Bayoumi 1990;
Tesar 1991; Obstfeld 1994; Taylor 1994a). In the tim~series specifications,
variables like real interest rates might be important, given the failure of the
stringent interest parity and other assumptions which theory suggests as prerequisites for the Feldstein-Horioka criterion to be satisfied (Frankel 1992).
Third, what about the fundamental macroeconomic intertemporal identities,
which assert that, in the long run, permment investment must equal permanent saving plus some constat
(initial wealth)? In this context, period
averaging, if the periods are long enough, may lead to a misspecification
in the cross-section approach by creating the estimation of an identity (or
an approximation thereof), and one with b ipso facto equal to one (Sinn
1992; Obstfeld 1994). Sinn (1992) advocates using a pure (one-period) crosssection estimator, which yields smaller estimates of b. This may not cure the
problem altogether if countries are close to equilibrium, and does nothing to
address cross-section heterogeneityy (including omitted variable biases). Several authors raise these issues as crippling problems with the cross-section
methodology, preferring instead to estimate the time-series specification only;
some work in this vein has used a cointegration approach that incorporates
a long-run equilibrium relationship between saving and investment and admits short-run disequilibrium dynamics (Miller 1988; Vik@ren 1991; Jansen
and Schulze 1996). The general criticism is essentially an argument against
the “pooling”

of time-seria

data, inherent in the “between”

estimator used

by Feldstein-Horioka, an approach which assumes away cross-country heterogeneity in the coefficients; timeseries analysis provides a test for these

restrictions, as shown by Fujiki and Kitamura (1995).
In this paper, an agnostic attitude is adopted concerning
tween time-series and cross-section

methods:

the choice be-

both will be estimated

for a

sample of ten countries with annual data from 1850 to 1988. Why? The
two methodologies have different interpretations, both potentially interesting. The implications of these approaches might usetily be examined for
the first time in a historical context where we have the opportunity to use a
complete stretch of data spanning almost a century and a half for a consistent sample. Further, the results from one of the estimation strategies might
usefully inform interpretations of the results from the other estimation strategy, and vice versa: trivially, long-rm capital mobility is built from a series
of short-run capital movements, after all.
On interpretation, the Feldstein-Horioka approach, it is argued, provides
no intrinsic absolute yardstick for measuring capital mobility. In short, even
when we do estimate b, and even when we think we have estimated correctly,
we still have no prior basis for judging how big is big, or how small is small,
Hence, the imperative of employing comparative analysis: b may have some
meaning when compared for cross-sections at different points in time, or for
time-series studies of different countries. Thus, Obstfeld’s findings that b
appears very high (around 0,7) for the gold standard, period before 1914,
a time of supposedly undisputed capital mobility, should perhaps moderate
our initial puzzlement on being exposed to Feldstein-Horioka coefficient in
the rmge 0.8-1.0 in the modern EC and OECD samples (Obstfeld 1986;
1994). This pragmatic, purely relative attitude to the interpretation of b is
tily embraced in the present study, where our data is ideally suited to such
m approach: we have about 140 sample periods for 12 individual countries,
which we may slice in a variety of cross-sections (every 10 or every 5 years)
or consider as Ml-length time series on a country-by-country
basis. The
resulting samples will yield a multiplicity of cross-section and time-series
estimates which can be compared across time and space to assess variations
in international capital mobility from one country to the next, and from one
period to the next. Hence, we have a methodological plan for this paper.

Data

What data might usefully be employed to apply the various saving-investment
criteria for capital mobility in a historical context? The appendix documents
the sources used in this paper, which yielded a set of annual timeseries
10

ob-

servations for a group of twelve countries over the period 1850-1992. Some
countries have incomplete or discontinuous data coverage, however: some
do not enter the sample until several decades after 1850, and some drop
out temporarily in the inter-war and wartime periods.
However, reasonably comprehensive coverage was possible for the sample of countries which
comprises Argentina, Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United Stat=.
The principal published sources are the statistical volumes of Brian Mitchell
(International Historical Statistics, 1983, 1992) and the World Bank ( WorldData on CD-ROM, 1994) and various national sourca. For the provision of
compiled data for the pre 1914 period adjusted for international gold flows
and changes in stocks I am grateful to Matthew Jonm and Maurice Obstfeld
(Jones md Obstfeld 1994). All such series build on the individual labors
of national statistical offices and individual scholars dedicated to the compilation and revision of national macroeconomic statistics. Like so many, I
am indebted to this devoted group of researchers. A Ml documentation of
these sources is provided in a data appendix at the end of this paper, and
the complete set of data is available from the author upon request.

“Long-Run” Capital Mobility Since 1850:
Cross-Section Correlations and The Traditional FH Test
Evidence from the FH Test

The standard technique employed for estimating long-run capital mobility
is the generic FH regression of average investment rates on a constant and
average saving rates. The regression is performed on a cross section of countriw indexed by i, where we use a “short” averaging period T (say, five or
ten years):
(J/Y)~
where (l/Y)i

=

$ ~~(l/Y)i~)

= aFH + bFH(S/Y)~ + ~~,
(S/Y)i

= ~ ~~(s/Y)i~.

(5)
The cross-section

coefficient bFH h= the conventional interpretation of a long-run savingsretention coefficient for the sample of countries.
In a sense, bFH is measuring the extent to which the sample of countries deviates, on average over
the sample period, from the closed-economy

11

property whereby saving rates

equal investment rates by identity. Since period averaging is employed the
procedure attempts to abstract from business cycle fluctuations that simultaneously affect both saving and investment. The averaging also implies that
this procedure has nothing to say about year-t~year (short-run) capital mobility: the ability of countries to temporarily run current-account surpluses
or deficits in response to shocks at high frequencies (meaing approximately
annual frequencies, or higher).
The restits are shown in Table 3 and Figure 2. The table displays the
econometric results and the fi~e
displays the coefficient b‘H for both 5-year
and ten-year averaging patterns. The table includes the estimated coefficient
bFH and various statistics for each cross-section regression: the R2, plus the
t-statistic and standard error of bFH. After 1870 the sample always includes
between 9 md 12 countri=-not
a huge sample, but comparable in size to
Feldstein md Baccheta’s (Feldstein and Bacchetta 1991) sample of nine EC
countries.
What do the results show? As noted earlier, before FH-type coefficients
can be interpreted we reqtire a benchmark for what constitutes a “high” or
a “low” bFH. Put another way, bFH comes equipped with no intrinsic absolute yardstick: we need to find a period we consider one of undisputed
capital mobility and then compare other bFH observations to this benchmark. Alternatively, we might search for movements in bFH as indicators
of whether saving-invwtment interdependence was relatively high or low for
a given period. In this regard, ou results present an ideal picture of the
relative movements in bFH over a centu.ry or more. Comparisons between
subperiods should allow us to infer whether long-run capital mobility
been unusually high or low during certain epochs.

Interpretation of the FH Test

For the present, what does the evolution of the bivariate b‘H for our sample
say about long-run international capital mobility over the last century or
more? Table 3 indicates that the estimated coefficient is significant in most
periods, and usually positive. It occ~ionally exceeds unity. Still, to reiterate,
absent a meaningful absolute scale for interpreting b‘H, this paper will take
the more conservative route, and consider only relative movements in the
coefficient. The restits reveal considerable fluctuation in the magnitude of
bFHover the long run. Relatively low values (“high mobility”) are associated
with the following periods: the 1880s, 1905–15 md the 1920s, and the 1980s
12

(I exclude the 1860s which have few data points).
On reflection, I believe, the results, and the trends from period to period,
can be re~onably interpreted. First, international capital market integration, = measured by b‘H for this admittedly small sample, has shown no
marked trend over the last hundred or so years: we can say that, in this narrow sense, saving-investment disassociation has been no stronger in the 1980s
for these countries than it was circa 1900. Second, the Feldstein-Horioka
savings-retention coefficient b‘H has not evolved uniformly or monotonically
over time. A story might be told m follows, considering Figure 2. Capital mobility was relatively high (low bFH) during the 1880s, when financial
markets were engaged in a frenzy of foreign investment. The crash of the
early 1890s brought this phase to a halt (higher bFH), and capital mobility
diminished markedly. Gradually, closer to World War One, capital mobility again increased (falling bFH) in the last great foreign investment boom
during the age of high imperialism, propelled largely by British capital flows
(Edelstein 1982). This episode was halted by the war, but only temporarily,
and, somewhat surprisingly, evidence of continued capital mobility is still
apparent after World War One, right up to 1929 (falling bFH), a sign of easing capital mobility during the boom of the roaring twenties (Kindleberger
1986). The Great Depression ushered in a time of increased autarky (Temin
1989; Eichengreen 1990; Eichengreen 1992). This phase W= associated with
increased capital controls and other impediments to capital mobility (Nurkse
1944; Einzig 1935). The structural change is also reflected in other measures
of capital mobility, marking the Deprwsion as a watershed in international
capital mobility (Taylor 1996; Taylor and Obstfeld 1996), The regime switch
effectively limited international capital mobility for several decades (rising
bFH), as capital controls persisted under Bretton Woods, The postwar period witnwsed an era of relatively weak international capital mobility, only
beginning to be overcome in the late 1970s and 1980s when bFH begins to
decline, albeit to a limited degree (Feldstein and Bacchetta 1991; Obstfeld
1994; Taylor 1994a). The evolution not only of the coefficient estimate of
b, but also of other me=ures of fit based on R2 and the t-ratio, follows a
similar pattern, as can be seen clearly in Figure 2. Finally we may note the
remarkable relationship between the rmults of the FH test and the historical

greater uncertainty in such episodes acted as barriers to the free movement
of capital.

Caveats

Can the results on the FH test be taken at face value, especially given the
numerous criticisms of this approach? In this brief sections I confront some
potential problems.
First, let us note the difficulties with historical data on saving rates.
These are constructed residually from estimates of investment and saving,
using the identity S/Y = 1/Y + CA/Y.
There is little reason to expect
that historical investment data (1, usually from macroeconomic
accounts)
and current-account data (CA, principally from trade records) will have correlated errors, but they certainly will have measurement error of some sort.
Since, by construction, 1/Y appears on both sides of the FH regression, this
will impart upward bias into the atimate of bFH. There is no way around this
absent independent saving data, which we simply do not have. One check for
bi= arising from errors in variables is to run the reverse regression of S/Y
on 1/Y (Maddala 1977, 293). This regression estimates how much domestic
investment demand spills into domestic saving and the result is also reported
)-l.
ln practice,

the results are inconclusive and very confusing, at least before 1930. However, after 1930 both regressions point to b being very close to 1, typically

alternative check to the reverse regrwsion is to implement the FH
a different form. The traditional test looks for a high correlation of

S/Y and 1/Y.
Corr(S/Y, 1/ Y) close to one implies near closure, close to
zero implies a fully flexible current wcount. An alternative is to look at the
relationship between our two trtiy observed data series, CA and 1: a fully

I/Y) = –1;
investment shocks would pass through fully into current account debits, as
the economy absorbs capital directly from the “world market. ” Conversely,
under a fixed, inflexible, near zero, or unresponsive current account we would
expect Corr(CA/ Y, 1/Y) close to zero. This method now has eliminated the
problem of correlated errors on left- and right-hind side variables-though
it cannot, of course, like any OLS system, be guaranteed to be free of simple me~urement errors in the right-hand side variable. The results are also
shown in Table 3 md in Figure 3 for comparison with the traditional FH
regression. The regr=sion (CA/ Y)i = a + b(I/Y)i + Ui yields a b estimate
significant and negative before World War One for many periods, but rarely
thereafter. In the 1880s, the coefficient approaches –0.6 and just before
1914 approaches – 1.0. This parallels our earlier ~count of the gold standard experience. However, after 1915 the coefficient is close to zero, and of
low significance. Thus, this alternate measure confirms the belief that
pre-1914 gold standard was a period of relatively good capital mobility,
provides little evidence for pronounced market integration thereafter.
Notwithstanding the technical difficulties, the interpretation is not
controversial.
The story told may seem to depart from conventional

the

unac-

counts. For example, the evidence of 1920s capital mobility seems implausible given that World War One disrupted international capital markets and
given the many qualitative interpretations of the decline in capital mobility during the collapse and fleeting restoration of the gold standard, and
the disappearance of the “hegemonic” stability formerly provided by London
and only half- heartedly emulated by New York. In the subsequent discussion of short-run capital mobility I will try to offer additional evidence that
might provide some reasonable grounds for interpreting the new findings:
there the evidence suggests that individual country experience showed considerable heterogeneityy in the various eras, from pre 1914, to inter-war, to
post- 1945. If the short-run capital mobility results have any connection to
long-run capital mobility properties, they might reasonably inform us that
whilst some countries almost certainly did experience a tightening of savinginvestment correlation after 1914, still some others experience a loosening,
In short, the evidence that follows suggests that capital-mobility experience
has been marked by great variety across time and space, with some countries
experiencing increased integration just when others experienced increased
disintegration—whilst all along an “average” me~ure over the cross-section
remained remarkably stable.
15

However, a simple test of the FH approach offers one more motivation
for a more flexible specification which admits cross-sectional heterogeneity.
Specifically, we can implement the test proposed by Fujiki and Kitamura
(1995), to see whether the implicit pooling in the FH approach is justified.
In this test, we recognize that the conventional FH regr~sion (equation 5)
is in fact a form of panel “between” estimator. In detail, we may comider a

By inspection, the FH approach (equation 5) is not a “pure” cross-section
estimator. By using tim~averaged data it may escape some of the short-run
cyclical variations which contaminate annual data at business-cycle frequencies, and this may be more pertinent for me~uring “long-ru”
capital mobility (Obstfeld 1994), Do= this averaging make a difference? To check,
we can follow Sinn (1992) and report the true bcs, as above, using one-year
“snapshots” of data throughout the whole sample. The results are shown
in Table 4 and Figure 4, Focusing on the figure, however, it is clear that
the timeaveraging
has not changed the qualitative rwult. Like bFH, Sinn’s
measure bcs exhibits a structural jump in the 1930s; it is usually small and
insignificant under the pre1914 gold standard except for the 1890s; and it
is large and significant after 1930, though declining in the 1960s, 1970s, and
1980, suggesting some mild and gradual improvements in capital mobility in
the postwar period (as Sinn has show).
In f~t, the FH approach is a between estimator for 5- or 10-year samples,
and ~FH= &OOlas above. However, some simple and standard econometric
algebra for panels demonstrate that the pooling estimator is a weighted sum

16

of the time-series and between estimators.7 Thus, if we accept the between
(FH) estimator, ought we to be willing to accept the pooling estimator?
Is such pooling justified? This amounts to a test of the restricted pooling
estimator against the unrestricted time-series estimator.
A simple F-test
proposed by F’ujiki and Kitamura (1995) allows us to discriminate between
the two, and thus explore the possibilityy of cross-section heterogeneit y in
the saving-investment relationship, The results of this test are also shown
in Table 3, and in all cases the pooling restrictions are rejected at standard
significance levels, in favor of individual-country

time-series ~timators.

Obviously more work is needed on the cross-section titivation
in other
respects. It would be desirable, given the evidence on heterogeneity, to introduce appropriate controls that might be necessary to alleviate potential
omitted-variable bias in the Feldstein-Horioka estimation procedure. 8 Efforts
might also be made to construct long-run time series of measures of financial
development, such as the ratio of financial assets to GDP, since such development almost certainly fmilitated the mobilization of capital and might
well have given simultaneous saving and investment incentives by reducing
transaction costs, Such concerns remain the target of ongoing work, 9

These findings caution against the loose characterization of capital mobility in cross-section samples assumed to be representative of the “world” capital market. Recent historical rwearch in international labor market mobility
has revealed evidence of marked segmentation in some c~es (Williamson
1995). Similarly, it might be worth refining our nations of international capital mobility to allow for different market segments: groups of countries, not
of uniform or stable membership over time, some of which have relatively
open capital market characterizations, some relatively closed. The individual country time-series perspective

allows us these nuances and it is to that

“Short-Run” Capital Mobility Since 1850:
An Error Correction Model

As already noted, an alternative approach to estimating the Feldstein-Horioka
savings-retention coefficient is to employ time-series analysis for an individual
country, with an atimating equation of the form 6. However, for technical
re~ons, there is no reason to expect bcs and bTs to bear any relation to each
other since the time-series and cross-section properties of the estimators differ dramatically, Moreover, the natural interpretation of the two coefficients
differs substantially-typically
bcs is considered an indicator of long-run international capital mobility in a sample group of countries, whereas bTs is
seen u a measure of short-run, year-to year international capital mobility in
a single country (Obstfeld 1986; Obstfeld 1994).
The time-series wtimation of the coefficient also raises additional

con-

cerns. Equation 6, if it is to be properly estimated, embodies an assumption
of stationarity in the series (1/ Y)it and (S/ Y)i~. Such an assumption may
indeed be valid, especially for short time frames. However, over longer horizons, several studies have cast doubt on the assumption that saving and
investment rates are truly stationary,
1994). Eichengreen reports Goldsmith’s data on the dramatic increase in the financial
asset to GDP ratio in several countries in the nineteenth
century, offering support for
the view that such structural
change in the operation of markets must be incorporated
in any coherent analysis of long-run international
capital market development.
Kose h=
recently introduced such variables in an a,nalysis of the Feldatein-Horioka
results for the
contemporary
period using the variables instructed
by King and Levine (Eichengreen
1990; King and Levine 1993; Kose 1994).

This result will come as no surprise to economic historians: the notion of
saving and investment shifts as important features of growth and structural
transformation in the long run is embodied in many national histories, including the famous “grand traverse” described by the United States economy
in the nineteenth century (Abramovitz and David 1973; David 1977). A similar upward shift in the investment rate has been documented in nineteenth
century Britain (Crafts 1985, chapter 4, for example). The stationarity of
some settler-economy

saving and investment rate series cotid also be called

into question b~ed upon an examination of long-run trends in the Australia
and Canadian data since 1870 (McLean 1994 illustrates the patterns), All
of the above observations impinge on this analysis since all four countries
are part of our sample. Of course, the same idea is seen elsewhere, and the
proposition that a structural shift in the level of saving and investment relative to GDP represents a key transition was at the heart of Arthur Lewis’s

We can use routine Dickey-Wler twts to check on the stationarity of the

stationary in all c=es. Thus, the new strand of cointegration research into
the properties of saving and investment correlation may have a particular
resonance in long-run historical applications. It is this line of enquiry that
will now be pursued.
The cointegration approach to the estimation of equation 6 has been much
discussed in the literature, and the details need not be repeated at length
19

here (Miller 1988; Leachman 1991; Vikgren 1991; Jansen and Schulze 1996).
If the series (S/ Y)it and (1/Y)l~ are nonstationary, but rather integrated,
say 1(1), then 6 is improperly

specified unless the series are cointegrated

so that the error term uit is still a stationary 1(0) series. A battery of
standard diagnostic procedures may be used to twt for this property of ui~.
In the case of cointegration, moreover, the Engle-Granger (1987) result shows
that a two-step procedure can reveal an error-correction representation of 6.
The simplest such representation, commonly adopted in the literature, is the
first-order error-correction model (ECM), written as follows (suppressing the
index for country z henceforth),

Following Jansen and Schulze (1996), I adopt 12 as a convenient estimating equation for implementing a well-specified test of the saving-investment
correlation.
It is immediately obvious that equation 12 embodies a longrun equilibrium relationship between saving and investment prescribed by
theory, where, in the steady-state equilibrium (denoted *, where A(l/Y)~
=
A(S/Y)t
= O), the implied relationship in levels is given by aEcM+#cM ((S/ Y, * —
(l/Y)*)

various natural hypotheses concerning the nature of this long-run equilibrium: if dEcM = O then the long-run equilibrium current account is equal
to a constmt, CA* = (S/Y)* – (1/Y)* = –aEcM/&cM; furthermore, if
aEcM = dEcM = O, then this constant is zero.

empirical investigation. We should also remember that recent econometric
advances suggest that the estimation of the error correction model 12 direct ly, without recourse to the tw~step Engle-Granger procedure, provides a
compact analytical methodology

and a direct, and arguably more powerful,

test for cointegration than the conventional tests such as Dickey-Fuller and

test of #cM being non-zero as equivalent to a test of cointegration. 11

present analysis, the specification 12 will be estimated for the long-run timeseries data for each country. The coefficient #cM also h= a natural interpretation: it measures the speed of convergence of the system toward equilibrium. Converted into a “half-life” measure, this providw an indication of the

The specification is now complete and the various hypothesis tests established, The coefficient bEcM is interpreted ~ the short-run savings-retention

significance of the coefficient #cM is used as a test for cointegration,

The co-

efficients aEcM and dEcM indicate the nature of the long-rm saving-investment
equilibrium. Various F-t~ts of restrictions (RI, R2, R3) compare the ECM
specification 12 with restricted alternatives commonly used in the literature,
and an F-t-t for structural stability (R4) detects whether the four-subperiod
sample split is justified.
The results, presented by country, appear in Tables 5 and 6, and Figure
5, The evidence suggests a wealth of contrasts between individual country
experiences with short-run international capital mobility over the last century or more. A discussion of the econometric specification in Table 5 is in
order. In most c~es the cointegration approach is justified, since the coefficient #cM is wually significant, and there is no country for which #cM is
never significant. Frequently, the weakest significance is for the post-1972
sample, which might be attributed to small smple size. The restriction
tats RI through R3 usually fail, suggesting that in most circumstances the
22

specification 12 dominates the alternatives commonly used in the literature.
Again, the small post-1972 sample usually generates the weakest tests. The
restriction test R4 usually fails, indicating that the regression coefficients
do not exhibit long-run stability, a result suggesting temporal heterogeneity
in individual countries’ capital mobility experience; the exceptions are Sweden and the United States, where the results are consistent with coefficients
which do not vary across the four sample periods. In most cases (all but
about a dozen cases out of 40 in the table), the implied long-run equilibrium
saving-investment relationship is indeed characterized by the property that
the steady-state current account (CA/Y)* = (S/Y)* – (1/Y)* equals a constant, as prescribed by theory (the restriction d‘CM = O holds); and in all
those cases the constant appears to be not significantly different from zero
(the restriction a ECM= O also holds).
Concerning the short-run savings-retention coefficients bEcM wtimated in
Table 2, we might turn to Figure 5 for a succinct presentation of the main
short-run capital mobility trends revealed by this analysis. The countries
are sorted alphabetically, with six in each chart for clarity. It appears that
many countries exhibit a coefficient trend consistent with the notion of increasing capital mobility over time: the serious exceptions to this proposition
are Argentina, Australia, Denmark and the United States. In the case of Argentina, the rising size and significance of the coefficient might be considered
an intelligible result given the grossly simplified (but not entirely inaccurate)
characterization of Argentina as a country with increasingly autarkic stance
in external markets over the course of the century. The Danish result is of
borderline significance, and this and the Australian restit may be possibly
due to the small sample size after 1974. In the c~e of the United States, the
result is less puzzling, since it cofirms earlier findings such as the large coefficient found by Frankel (1992) using levels and differences; the result is quite
plausibly a “large country” aberration—since the U.S. is such a large player
in world capital markets, shocks to saving rate might quite plausibly

spill

over into the world interest rate, md hence into domestic investment. All
of these distinct country experiences certainly warrant further study. How
robust are the resdts? How do they conform to qualitative evaluations of
capital-market performance over time and the conventional historical treatments of national experience with international

capital markets?

Are there

specific institutional or historical experiences that can explain the very different trends and peaks across countries?
The coefficient &cM also reveals interesting patterns of heterogeneity.
23

For

example, the countries with the most-sustainable current-account imbalances
before 1914 were Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the United States—a result entirely comistent with the status of these four settler economies as the
principal importers of British capital. A marked shift occurs after 1914 for
this group. In the inter-war period, however, Germmy stands out = a country facing sever financing constraints in the form of a very fast adjustment
speed (exceeding one! ): itiows were very quickly offset by countervailing
outflows, and vice versa, reflecting the very unstable capital market of the
time. Across all periods, the main financial centers, the U.K. and U. S., show
relatively low speeds of convergence, as expected. After 1974, Norway shows
a very sustainable deficit, a well-known consequence of oil discoveries.
We might also ponder to what extent the variety of country experience
indicated by bEcM and &cM can help us understand the fluctuations in the
bcs (or b~~) measure of long-run capital mobility discussed earlier in this
paper. In a tritial sense, the long-run is just a concatenation of short-runs, so
although the methodologi~
may have different natural interpretations they
may helpfully inform each other. A natural qu=tion to ask is whether the
savings-retention coefficient differs in the long and short run. For example,
in the ten-country sample, the average value of bEcM in Table 5, averaged
across countries, by period, is as shown in Table 6: rising from 0.48 before
1914 to 0,59 in the inter-war period, and continuing to rise to 0.61 during
Bretton Woods and to 0.69 in the recent float. Looking at #cM we see an
initial rise in the inter-war period from 0.28 to 0.47, then a leveling off after
1946 at 0.55, falling after 1974 to 0.39.
We may view these coefficient populations u a draw from a heterogeneous
panel of countries and examine the distribution of coefficients for any changes
across sampl~, Obviously, it cannot be argued that any subsequent period
has improved on the degree of capital mobility seen before 1914. The shortrun pass-through coefficient bEcM is always higher in later periods. However,
in terms of sustainability of capital flows measured by &cM, some improvement is seen after the setbacks of the inter-war period. The half-life duration
is cut almost in half after 1914, but by the 1970s and 1980s it is rising once
again.
The findings are fairly consistent with the conventional wisdom: capital
mobility h= changed little over the long run, but suffered a setback in the
inter-war period. If this bears any relation at all to average long-run capital
mobility in the ten countries we wotid have some framework for interpreting
the cross-sectional results: the constacy
of bcs over time may not reflect so
24

much a lack of global capital market integration, but the sometime entrance
and departure of various countries from the “club” of well-integrated countries, as evidenced by the very different paths taken by bEcM and &cM in
different countries. Here, then, the time-series results offer some perspective
on the evolving segmentation in the world capital market, and possibly some
insight into the “puzzling” persistence of a high bcs over time.
Another averaging experiment produces another reasonable r~tit, where
we view the coefficients as a draw from a heterogeneous panel of countries,
The average value of b‘H from Table 3 is about 0.7 for the sample over all
periods (0.70 for lo-year periods in the top panel; 0.69 for 5-year periods
in the bottom panel); the average value of bEcM from Table 6 is about 0.6
for the sample over all periods (0.59 for for the four subperiods).

reckoning, the average “long-m
savings-retention” coefficient (O.7) has been
higher than the “short-run savings-retention” coefficient (0.6) over the last
century or more, suggesting a plausible interpretation: that capital mobility
has always been greater in the short run than in the long. Such is a result we
would expect given the shorter time-horizon and commensurately lower costs
and risks of temporary shifts in national =sets across national boundaries,
and also given the likelihood that borrowing constraints bind less severely
in an “incremental fashion” in the short run (for example, the need for a
temporary funding facility through a current account deficit to deal with
transitory circumstances) compared with the manner in which they bind in
the full portfolio sense in the long run (as in the persistent running of current
account imbalances entailing a structural shift asset distribution). This view
also accords with conventional wisdom, and the view that “hot money” flows
of short-term capital have always been more mobile than the “cold-money”
flows of long-term capital.

Conclusion

This study has presented a number of new r=ults using one widely applied
criterion for short- and long-run capital mobility, the Feldstein-Horioka test.
The results offer some support for the conventional qualitative accounts of
long-run developments in the international capital market. In cross section,
the results show a marked tightening of the saving-investment correlation in
periods of global economic crisis, symptomatic of diminishing capital mobility
in such periods. In time series the r~dts show considerable heterogeneity

25

in individual country experience that warrants further study. The study
advances debate by refining our “yardstick” of measurement for the FeldsteinHorioka coefficient; since the coefficient embodies no absolute standard, its
interpretation must rest on comparative studies of the coefficient and its
variation across time and space. Thus, the estimates of cross-section and
time-series (error-correction) coefficients for a ten-country sample over almost
150 years offer a sounder basis for historical interpretation
evolution of international capital mobility.

of the long-run

Nonetheless, the work offers scope for further research to address remaining concerns, some of them intrinsic to the Feldstein-Horioka methodology,
some of them a consequence of the incompleteness of our historical data
sources. Concerning data, much remains to be explored in further work, It
would be desirable to extend the sample to more countri=, say 15 or 20 in
total, and a more detailed examination of other national accounts data might
yield further sample points, although the mtimum

cross-section

sample of

currently reliable time-series sources before 1914 is almost surely bonded
below 20. In addition, the cross-section heterogeneity will prompt a search
for additional control variables. Such work is planned for the future.
For the present the results offer a consistent qumtitative perspective on
the long-run evolution of international capital market integration in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, For interpretative purposes I have been strict
on the structure of the analysis: for meaningful results, care has to be taken to
gather data in a uniform way over time for all countries, and apply exactly
the same methodology over time and space in the estimations.
We have
previously

seen various cross-section

“snapshots”

of the saving-investment

correlations: for example, in the studies of Obstfeld (1986; 1994), Bayoumi
(1989), Zevin (1992), and Eichengreen (1990). We have also seen various
studies that have used individual country time-series over the very long run,
as in Frankel’s (1992) study of United States experience. Others, like Zevin
(1992), have appropriated these quantity-b=ed
criteria and melded them
with price-based criteria for market integration. 12

Presently, the quantity-based

criteria remain a staple approach for histor-

ical studies, and, as this paper tries to show, might still reveal provocative
insights. The findings also have broader implications for the debate over
globalization and convergence (Williamson 1996). Abrarnovitz (1986) and
Baumol (1986) noted the long-run patterns of convergence in income per
capita in a cross-section of countries, using the historical national income
data of Maddison (1991 and his previous studies). Abramovitz noted that
not only technological convergence, but also “trade and its rivalries” might
have played a part in this historical convergence process, the latter including
factor mobility. The convergence findings were corroborated by Williamson
(1995) for real wages, and these patterm maybe linked to the evolution and
integration of global labor and commodity markets (see Williamson 1996).
Of course, there may be substantial complementaritiea between labor and
capital mobility, as in the theory of factor price convergence, and as historical experience shows (0’ Rourke, Taylor, and Williamson 1996).
The pr-ent paper complements a larger literature on factor mobility, and
can help us gauge the importance long-run capital mobility to the historical
convergence process. The inter-war period, and the Great Depression in particular, are highlighted = a major structural shift in capital mobility, as other

1850-1914: The investment rate measure (1/Y)~ is the ratio of gross investment It to national income Yt at current local prices; the saving rate (S/ Y)~
was usually calculated implicitly, via the current account identity, as the investment rate (1/ Y)t plus the ratio of the current account CAt to national income:
(l/Y)t = lt/~, (S/Y)t = (lt/~) + (CAt/~).
Except ss otherwise indicated this
data is taken from Jones and Obstfeld (1994), who revised the standard sources
to correct for flows of gold and changes in stocks.
1915–1959: The investment and saving rates are defines as above: saving rates
are still calculated residually from the current account. Except as otherwise indicated this data is taken from Mitchell (1983,1992) using his national income and
overall current balance series at current prices. The overall current balance series
are converted from U.S dollars using his exchange rate series as necessary.
1960-1992: Estimates of gross domestic saving, gross domestic investment, and
gross domestic saving at current prices from World Bank (1994).

Argentina
1885-1913: Nominal investment constructed from Di Tella and Zymelman’s (1967)
real investment index and Della Paolera’s (1988) price level, linked to the IEERAL
(1986) value for 1913. Nominal income from Della Pmlera’s (1988) output index
and price level, linked to the IEERAL (1986) value for 1913 (similar results obtain
using Cort6s Conde’s (1994) estimates). Exports, imports, and debt service from
Williams (1920), Ford (1962), and Della Paolera (1988) in gold pesos, converted to
28

paper pesos using Della Paolera’s (1988) price series. Missing data on debt service
for 1892–94 approximated at total balance of borrowings according to Williams
plus $7 million gold pesos, the approximate annual new borrowings (very small)
in the Baring crisis years 1891–95. Missing data on debt service between Williams’
1900 and Ford’s 1912 observations (the latter from Phelps 1938)) is approximated
by interpolation along an exponential trend, since there were no defaults in this
period, and debt probably grew relatively smoothly.
1914–59: Inv-tment, and the current account (exports and imports) in current
prices from IEERAL (1986).
Australia
1861-1988: Derived from the previously compiled estimates of N. Butlin (1962),
M. Butlin (1977), and McLean (1994), as described in Taylor and Williamson
(1994).
Canada
1870–1984: Investment rate and residually-calculated saving rate from Urquhart
(1988).
France
1922–38: The overall current balance is taken from Mitchell, but is converted
from gold francs to (current) paper france using series on the value of the franc
relative to parity taken from the League of Nations, Annuaire Statistigue (various
issues).

Germany
1925-35, 1950-59: Based on Mitchell, but refers to West Germany only after 1945.
Before 1945, Mitchell gives data on net capital formation. This is inflated to an
approximation of gTosscapital formation using an assumed capital-output ratio of
3 and an sssumed depreciation rate of 3%.
