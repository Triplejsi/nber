THE PROPER SCOPE OF GOVERNMENT:
THEORY AND AN APPLICATION
TO PRISONS

ABSTR4CT

When should a government
provision?

provide a service inhouse and when should it contract out

We develop a model in which the provider can invest in improving the quality of service

or reducing cost, If contracts are incomplete, the private provider has a stronger incentive to engage
in both quality improvement and cost reduction than a government employee. However, the private
contractor’s incentive to engage in cost reduction is typically too strong because he ignores the
adverse effect on non-contractible

quality.

The model is applied to understanding

the costs and

benefits of prison privatization.

The choice between Lnhouse provision and contracting out

has proved to be quite controversial.

Advocates of government contracting point

out that private suppliers deliver public services at a lower cost than public
employees (Savas 1982, 1987, hgan

The efficiency of inhouse provision also turns on

the strength of the incentives of government employees, and on the importance to
the government of generating quality innovations.

We show in Section 3 that the

conclusions emerging from the model are generally extremely intuitive, including
the result that private provision is generally cheaper, but may generate either
higher or lower quality. Section 3 also briefly addresses a key omission from the
model, namely the possibility of ex post competition between contractors, which
typically strengthens the case for privatization.
The basic ❑odel in Section 2 deals with a benevolent government.

Many of

the concerns about government contracting, however, deal with the reality of a
less than perfect government, in which politicians are corrupt or interested in
favoring their political supporters to attract votes.

interest in votes of public employees creates the reverse bias.

and private provision of a good, such as prison, hospital, or school services.

is to provide the good ‘in-house,” e.g. , the government can

arrange for public employees to run the prison.

The ❑odel is based on the idea

4This assumption ❑akes good sense in the case of prisons but is more
controversial in the case of schools or hospitals.
‘See Grossman and Hart (1986). What may be ❑ ore important is not who
owns the physical prison, but who has the right to use it (perhaps for a
restricted period of time). For exemple, the government ❑ay own the prison,
but sell the right to operate it to a private company for n years (a
franchising arrangement).
In this case, the private company has residual
control rights during the n year period. In this paper, we do not distinguish
between physical ownership and possession of the right to use the prison.

The modified good yields a benefit B to society and costs the ❑anager C to

Similarly, C can be represented in dollars.
The manager can ❑anipulate B andC

that M can devote effort to two types of “innovation” relative to the basic good:

12We have analyzed private ownership under the assumption that the
private owner actually manages the firm. This is not a bad assumption for the
case we are most interested in--prisons.
In future work, however, it would be
useful to extend the analysis to situations where there is a separation
between ownership and control.
Some of the most important trade-offs that we
have identified are still likely to be relevant. Note in particular that it
will still be the case that the owners and managers of a private firm have an
excessive tendency to reduce costs, since they can collectively divide the
gains from cost reduction among themselves, ignoring the adverse quality
impact on society. The implications for quality innovation are more
complicated.
To the extent that the manager of a private firm is less
replaceable than the manager of a public firm (because the private company’s
shareholders are dispersed, say), the private company manager’s incentives to
innovate will be greater than the public ❑anager’s. However, to the extent
that the manager of a private firm must share the fruits of his innovation
with both his owner(s) and the government, as opposed to just the government,
the private manager’s incentives to innovate will be smaller (on the latter
effect, see kffont and Tirole (1993) and Hart and Moore (1990)).

manager at date O (no relationship-specific

Hence N’s future payoff is zero, which means that this is also the politician’s
bribe!

The conclusion is that the corrupt politician always wants to privatize

F even if this is socially inefficient.
Even if the politician can force the bureaucrat to retain the manager whom
the politician has selected, the bribes that a politician can extract from this

The most controversial

and interesting issues raised by private prisons

concern the quality of senice.

Quality covers order in the prisons (security

of prisoners, escapes, staff conduct toward prisoners, violence by guards and
between prisoners, disciplinary procedures etc), amenities that prisoners receive
(q~lity

Objections to prison privatization typically focus on quality.

comparisons are often disputed by critics of prison privatization,
since private prisons apparently get somewhat less violent prisoners (Donahue
1988, Shichor 1995), and since some of the costs of private incarceration
-such as the continued need for public oversight -- are often ignored in the

34
Robbins’ proposal iS similar to contracting for the highest quality in all states
of the world, which in general is not efficient16.
A look at a 1990 contract between the Corrections Corporation of America
(CCA) on the one hand, and the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson
County, Tennessee on the other, suggests that ACA standards can play a pivotal
role in contracting.

This contract covers the construction and three years of

Overall, the impression conveyedby

and the actual contract is that -- if best practice is followed -- ❑any aspects
of the quality of incarceration can be addressed through contracting.

l%e
key assumptions of the ❑odel of Section 2 -- that quality cannot be
contracted on -- really stands for something ❑ ore subtle, namely the idea that
it is too costly to specify the Pfficien t quality level corresponding to every
possible state of the world.
It is not a contradiction of the model if quality level can be specified in all circumstances; the point is that this
quality level may be too high or too low. Robbins’ (1989) proposal illustrates
this point. His approach can be thought of as an attempt to make quality
contractible.
The problem is that it does so by choosing quality so high that
it is arguably uneconomic to supply it, e.g., the prison may be forced to take
so ❑any precautions to avoid escapes that it cannot make a profit.
In other
words, it would be as if someone who wanted a secure house built were to
“solve” the contracting problem by specifying that the house should be
impregnable against all disasters, including nuclear attack. Not
surprisingly, no public prison satisfies Robbins’ criteria.
17Robbins wants public employees to play a more active role in discipline
and appeals than the Tennessee contract envisions.

35

Contractual Incompleteness
Although contracts can address some quality issues, in several important
areas incompleteness is evident, and can in principle compromise the quality of
eiervice&livered

by a private contractor,

The two crucial areas we concentrate

on are use of force and quality of personnel.

These areas have been the focus

of much of the criticisms of private prisons.

In both of these areas, “best

practice” contracts appear to be seriously incomplete in ways that can easily
lead to quality deterioration,
A famous court case, Hedina v. O’Neill (1984), illustrates the persistent
concerns about both the excessive use of force and the poor quality of personnel
in private

prisons.

According

to Shichor

(1995),”In

1981,

in Houston,

26

20 of the detainees were held at the local jail and 6 of them were placed with
a local private security firm.
to hold six people.

The private firm placed them in a cell designed

A day later 10 of the 20 detainees held in the jail also

were transferred to the private firm for custody, and they were placed in the
same cell, which was already filled to its capacity

(bgan,

1990).

In this

situation 16 illegal immigrants were held in a 12 ft by 20 ft holding cell.

A

day after the transfer of the 10 aliens to the private facility, the detainees
tried to escape from the facility and a private guard in his attempt to prevent
the escape accidentally killed one of them with a shotgun and seriously wounded
another one.

The private guard apparently was untrained in the use of firearms,

and his intention was to use his gun as a cattle prod to force the detainees back
to their cell (p. 104).”

Interestingly, when ruling on this case, the Fifth

Circuit Court of Appeals overturneda

lower court ruling against the INS and held

that “(1) INS officials had no statutory duty to provide appropriate detention

36

facilities for excludable aliens, and (2) aliens’ due process rights were not
violated” (Logan 1990, p. 183).

In short, guards can use excessive force, guards

may be untrained, and still courts see no violation of law (or contract).

(1985) and Donahue (1988) offer additional examples of the poor training and low
human capital of private prison personnel.

Contract Supervision and Oversight
Our discussion so far has stuck to the ❑odel of a benevolent government
writing and enforcing a contract, limited only by the difficulties of writing
good contracts.

The history of private incarceration, however (like ❑uch of the

rest of history of government), points to the co~on

incidence of corruption in

allocating contracts, as well as to deficient contract enforcement.

Shichor

The first

private prison contract went to Jemes Estell, a politically powerful ❑ember of
the legislature, who used his authority to enrich himself and his friends with
lucrative subcontracts while abusing prisoners (Shichor, 1995, p. 40). How does

41
the present practice compare with the past7
The examination

of ESMOR and other evidence

indicates

that the issues

analyzed in Section 5 remain germane to actual prison contracting. First, private
prison companies

are very active politically.

For instance, ESMOR evidently

lobbies politicians and makes political contributions to receive contracts (New
York Times, 7/23/1995).

The wife of Tennessee governor -r

Alexander invested

early and profitably in the stock of Corrections Corporation of Merica,

which

subsequently got Involved very deeply in the privatization of Tennessee prisons
with the governor’s endorsement (The New Republic, 3/4/96, p. 9).
Second, contract enforcement cannot be taken for granted.

The INS report

concludes that ESMOR’ s changes in policies “hindered INS ability to effectively
perform its oversight functions” .

The report also notes that ESMOR told its

guards not to share information with the INS officials working on the premises,
and in one instance encouraged

the INS to reassign an officer who complained

about the performance of the Elisabeth, N.J. facility several months prior to the
riot.

The report indicates that ESMOR violated the contract in some instances,

and also pursued policies preventing INS from enforcing the contract.

But it is

also clear from the report that INS did not do what it could to enforce this
contract,
relatively

The INS report vividly illustrates how a government bureaucracy with
weak

incentives has

with

a private

supplier determined to reduce its costs, even if this involves violations of the
contract and not just the issues on which the contract is silent.
Third,

the INS contract

imposed no or light penalties

for performance

failures (e.g., as far as we can tell, $80 as a penalty for an escape, of which
there were dozens from the start), and was generally extremely soft compared, for
example, to the Tennessee contracts.

ESMOR is even negotiating with the

INS

42
about the resumption of operations in the Elizabeth, N.J. , facility.

The costs

of contract violations to the private contractor, therefore, do not appear to be
very high.
In the case of prisons, then, the benevolent government perspective might
give an excessively optimistic picture of private contracting.

Should prisons

be privatized?

Prisons seem to fit reasonably well into our framework.

Although in some

respects prison contracts are very detailed, they are still seriously incomplete.

6. Other activities.
In some ways,

the model we presented was constructed

to fit prisons.

However, our model helps us to analyze other activities as well, as we show in
this section.

In the process, we also examine some of the ❑odel’s limitations.

In this renegotiation,

the government presumably would have to pay the private contractor more than it
would pay an employee, who is totally replaceable when no ex ante investments are
needed.

Inhouse provision in this case of few investments and enormous ex post

holdup opportunities

seems clearly superior,

A skeptic can respond to this analysis by suggesting that perhaps ex ante,
the government should auction off the foreign policy contract for a vast amount
of money with an understanding that it is going to be regularly held up ex post.
What is wrong with this arrangement?

In our theory, we have assumed that M is

wealthy enough to pay up front for the right to own F when private ownership is
optimal.

However, in some cases, such as the conduct of foreign policy, M may

not be wealthy enough. This creates a further argument for public ownership when
H’s ex post holdup power vastly exceeds the amount he can raise ex ante for the
contract,

If M cannot compensate G in advance for all the future holdups when

G changes the contract, then the extraction of surplus from G by M is socially
wasteful.

Hence

the government may wish to own F simply to avoid having

argument is developed further in Trinh (1996). One may ask why M

The answer Is that a bank ❑ay be unwilling to lend to M, since there is
nothing to stop M from “holding up” the bank by refusing to hold up the
government.
That is, having received his loan, M can threaten not to hold up
the government at tite 1 and use this threat to renegotiate downwards his
repayment to the bank (Hart and Moore 1994), Anticipating this, the bank will
refuse to lend to M.

An important example that goes outside of our basic ❑odel is the provision

of schooling.

This is a very important topic for

future research.

Police and Armed Forces

If the police or armed forces were privatized, the owners of the resulting
private companies would have enormous power.

Part of this power would stem from

could use this power to hold up the government and society.

The owners

For example, suppose

as an extreme case that nuclear weapons were sold off to a private company and
an (incomplete) contract was written with the company as to how these weapons
should be used in the event that the country is threatened with attack.

The

concern is obviously that the private company would wriggle out of the incomplete
contract and either threaten to withhold the weapons in the event of an emergency
to extract a huge side-payment from the government, or even

threaten to use the

weapons against the country itself unless it receives such a side-payment.
We stress that keeping the nuclear stockpiles -- or armed forces -- public
does not eliminate the possibility of attempted holdup.

A general who is a state

employee could use his access to nuclear weapons to attempt to hold up society.
After all, coups and rebellions by the armed forces do sometimes occur.
there is a difference between the private and public cases.

However,

If nuclear weapons

or the armed forces are publicly controlled, the government can take early action
to prevent a potential holdup.

If it suspects that an errant general is engaged

in treasonous activities, it can fire the general.

In contrast, in the private

case, it would have to wait until a clear breach of contract occurred; this ❑ight
be too late.

In our model, a public general can be kept replaceable almost at

all times, whereas a private M can ❑ake substantial investments to make himself
costly to replace.
