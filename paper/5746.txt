long been subject to both economic regulation
and to pressure from changing economic conditions. These pressures were particularly
striking in the 1970’s and 1980 ‘s. Congress passed
legislation to regulate automotive emissions and
throughout the period emissions standards were
tightened. This period also witnessed two sharp
increases in the price of gasoline (see figure 1).
There is a large literature detailing the industry’s response to the changes in both emissions
standards and in gas prices, e.g. [1], [2], [3]1 [4],
[5], [6]. We add to this literature
by considering
how these changes have altered production costs
at the level of the individual
production
unit,
the automobile
assembly plant.
We also note
that when we combine our results with data on
the evolution of automobile

mation, we still only have a limited number of
observations per product.
Thus, it is not possible to estimate separate cost functions for each
product.
Our model follows a long tradition in
treating products as bundles of characteristics
(see [9]) and then modeling demand and cost m
functions of these characteristics.
As in homogeneous product models, the model also allows
costs to depend on output quantities and on input prices, We call our cost function a hedonic
cost function because it is the production
counterpart of the hedonic price function introduced
by Court [10] and revived by Griliches [11].
Hedonic cost functions of this sort have been
estimated
before using different
assumptions
and/or different types of data than those used
here, For example, [12], [13] and [7] all make assumptions on the nature of equilibrium
and on
the demand system which enable them to use
data on price, quantity, and product characteristics to back out estimates of the hedonic cost
function without ever actually using cost data.
This, however, is a rather indirect way of estimating the hedonic cost function which depends
on a host of auxiliary assumptions,
and partly as
a result, often runs into empirical problems (e.g.

Data file is described. Next we present estimates
of the parameters
defining the hedonic marginal
cost function, and consider how this function has
changed over time. The final two sections integrate data on movements in an index of the mpg
of cars in given horsepower weight classes, and in
applications
in relevant patent classes, into the
analysis.

paper, we consider only linear input-output
coefficients, i.e.

factor demand equations into an “ hedonic cost
function”.
We focus hereon estimates of the materials demand equation, leaving the input demand equations for labor and capital for later work. There
are several reasons for our focus on materials
costs. First, m shown below, our data, which
are for auto assembly plants, indicate that most
costs are materials costs. Second, of the three
inputs that we observe, materials might most
plausibly be treated in a static cost-minimization
framework.
Third, we find that our preliminary
results for materials are fairly easy to interpret,
while those for labor and capital prwent some
unresolved puzzles. Of course, we may discover
that the reasons for the problems in the labor
and capital equations require us also to modify
the materials equation, so we continue to explore
, other approaches in our on-going research.
The materials demand equation that we estimate for automobile model j produced a~ plant p
in time period t has several components.
In our
companion paper we discuss alternative specifications for these components,
but here we only
provide some intuition for the simple functional
form that we use.
Since we are concerned that because labor and
capital may be subject to long term adjustment
processes in this industry, a static cost minimizing assumption for them might be inappropriate,
we consider a production function that is conditional on an arbitrary
index of labor and capital. This index which may differ with both product characteristics, -to be denoted by z, and with
time, or t, and will be denoted by G(L, 1{, x, t).
Given this index, production is assumed to be a
fixed coefficient times materials use,
The demand for materials, M, is then a constant coefficient times output.
That coefficient,
to be denoted by C(zj, cPt, ~), is a function of:

While we ~sume that average variable costs
are constant (i. e. that the variable portion of input demand is linear in output), we do allow for

We denote the fixed nlaterials requirement
as p.
There may also be some fixed cost to producing
more that one product at a plant. Specifically,
let there be a set-up cost of A for each product
produced at a plant; we might think of this as a

We also removed plants that produced a significant number of automobile parts for final sale
since we had no way to separate out the cost of
producing those parts.g
The Census data is from the Longitudinal Re(the LRD), which, in turn,

Although the Census data on costs are on a

Table 1 provides characteristics
of our sample.
It covers about 50 percent of total U.S. production of automobiles, with higher coverage at the
end of the sample. The low coverage stems from
our decision to drop the large number of plants
prod ucing both automobiles and light trucks or
vans. There are about 20 active automobile assembly plants each year in our sample, and 29
plants that were active at some point during our
sample period, 1° These plants are quite large.
Depending on the year, the average plant assembles 130 to 202 thousand automobiles,
and employs 2,814 to 4,446 workers (about 85 percent
of them production workers). Note that the average plant produces 2.4 to 3.4 distinct models
each year.

Of course the characteristics
of the vehicles

Annual averages for many of these characteristics
are provided, for example, in [7], although those
numbers are for the universe of cars sold, rather
than for our production sample. In our sample,
the number of cars with air conditioning as standard equipment begins at near zero near the beginning of the sample and increases to almost
1570 by 1982. Average miles per gallon, discussed further below, incre=es from 14 to about
23, while average horsepower declines from about
148 to near 100. The weight of cars also decreases from about 3800 to 2800 pounds.

As noted, in addition to characteristics
valued
directly by the consumer (such as horsepower,
size, or mpg), we are also interested in how the
technological
characteristics
of a car (particularly those that effected emissions and fuel efficiency) changed over time and affected costs.
In our sample period, the automobile
companies adopted a number of new technologies in
response to both lower emission standards and
higher gas prices. Bresnahan and Yao [17] have
collected detailed data on which cars used which
technology. 13 In particular,
using the EPAs Test
Car List, they tracked usage of five technologies:
no special technology (a baseline), oxidation catalysts (i. e, catalytic converters),
three-way catalysts, three-way closed-loop catalysts and fuel
injection.
Census confidentiality
requirements
prohibit us from presenting the proportion of vehicles in our sample using each of these technologies, so Table 3 uses publically available data to
compute the fraction of car models build by U.S.
producers using each technology in each model
year. The base line technology W= used in virtually all models until the 1975 model year, at
which time most models shifted to catalytic converters.
The catalytic converters began to be
displaced by the more modern technologies in
the 1980 model year, and by 1981 they had been
displaced in over 80

product characteristics
(the z variables), and, in
the right most specification, the time-specific parameters (the ~t) that shift the variable component of the materials cost over time [see equation
(5)].
In many studies, the parameters on the z variables would be the primary focus of analysis.
However in the present context they are largely
included as a set of colitrols that allow us to get
more accurate estimates of the shifts in material
costs over time (i. e. of the i5t). The difference
between the two sets of results presented in the
table is that the second set includes these ~t while
the first does not. The sum of square residuals
(ssq) reported at the bottom of the table indicate that these time effects are jointly significant
at any reasonable level of significance.
The estimates

tion do not provide a sharp indication of the importance of model change-over costs, or of fixed
costs (at least after allowing for the time effects), or of a constant cost that is independent of
the characteristics
of the car. However, most of
the product characteristics
have parameter estimates that are economically and statistically
significantly.
For example, the coefficients on Air
Conditioning
(AC) indicate that having AC as
standard equipment increases per car materials
costs by about $2,600 (in the specification with
the Jt) and by about $3,600 (in the specification
without).
We think that the AC dummy variable proxies for a package of “luxury standard
equipment”, so the large figures here are not surprising. A one mile per gallon (MPG) increase
in fuel efficiency is estimated to raise costs in the
range of $80 to $160, while a one pound increase
in weight (WT) increases costs by around $1.30
to $1.50.
The table presents estimates of in(d), not levels, so the coefficients Iiave the approximate
interpretation
of percell tdge changes over the base
year of 1972. In the early years these coefficients
are not significantly different from zero, but they
become significant in 1977 and stay so. There appears to be a clear upward trend, with apparent
jumps in 1977 and 1980.

greater tightening occured. Table 4 finds a jump
in production costs in 1980 but not in 1975.
One possible explanation
is that early adjustments
to the fuel emissions
requirement
were crude, but relatively inexpensive and came
largely at the cost of ‘performance’
(a characteristic which may not be adequately
captured
8

byour observed characteristics).
Later technologies, such as fuel injection, may have been more
costly in dollar terms, but less so in terms of
performance.
We use the technology variables described in
Table 3 to study the effect of technology in more
detail.
These variables are potentially
inter-ting because, while there is no cross-sectional
variation in fuel efficiency and emissions requirements, there is cross-sectional
variation in technology. Thus they might let us differentiate between the impacts on costs of other time specific
variables (e.g. input prices), and the new technologies that were at least partially introduced
as responses to the emissions requirements.
In
particular we would like to know if the technology variables can help to explain the increasing
series of time dulnmies found in Table 5.
Let ~j~ be a vector of indicator variables for
the type of technology used in model j at time
t. We introduce
these technology indicators as
a further proportional
shift term in the estimation equation.
In particular,
we alter equation
(3) so that the variable portion of the materials

believe that simple catalytic converters may be
relatively cheap, while the others may be more
expensive.
Therefore as a second specification
we constrain the ~ for catalytic converters (technology 1) to be equal to the baseline technology.
We see that the technology parameters,
the
y ‘s, generally have the expected sign and pattern. In the first specification,
the ~ associated
with simple catalytic converters is -timated
at
about zero, while the others are positive, though
not statistically
significantly so, and increasing
as the technology becomes more complex.
In
the second specification (with 71 s O) the coefficients on technology are individually
significant
and have the anticipated,
increasing pattern.
Recall, from Table 3, that simple catalytic converters began to be used at the time of the first
tightening of emissions standards,
and were used
almost exclusively between 1975 and 1979 (inclusive). In 1980 when the emissions standard were
tightened for the second time, the share of catalytic converters begal~ to fall, and by 1981 the
simple catalytic converter technology had been
abandoned by over 80 per cent of the models.
Thus the small cost coefficient on catalytic converters is consistent with Table 4’s small estimate
of the change in production
costs following the
first tightening in emissions requirements,
while
the larger cost effects of the later technologies
helps explain Table 4’s estimated increase in production costs following the second tightening of
the emissions standards
in 1980. Indeed, once
we allow for the technology classes as in Table 5,
the time effects ( the 6’s) are only marginally significant, and there is no longer a distinct upward
trend in their values.
As an outside check on our results, we note
that the Bureau of Labor Statistics
publishes
an adjustment
to the vehicle component
of the

where y is the vector of parameters
giving the
proportionate
shift in marginal costs associated
with the different technologies. Just as one of the
6’s is normalized to one, so we normalize the ~
associated with the bmeline technology to zero.
Note that we can separately identify the 6’s and
the T‘s because oft he cross-sectional variation in
technologies.
Table 5 gives some results from estimating the
materials equation with the technology variables
included.
The first is exactly as in (7). From
prior knowledge and from this first regression, we

emissions standards (the information is obtained
from questionnaires
to plant managers; see the
Report on Quality Changes for Model Passenger
Cars, various years). After taking out their adjustments for retail margins and deflating their
series, we find that it shows a sum total of $71
in emissions adjustment
costs between 1971 and
1974 and then an increlllent of $176 in 1975. The
BLS’S series then increases by only 56 dollars between 1975 and 1979 but jumps by 632 dollars
between 1979 and 1982, Table 5 estimates very
similar numbers. Note however that some of the
costs of the new technologies that we are picking
up may have been partially offset by improved
performance characteristics
not captured in our
X15.

Efficiency

of the

New

Car

Recall that g= prices increased sharply in 1973
and then again between 1978 and 1980. They
trended downward from 1982. Table 6 (from the
[7] dataset) shows how the median fuel efficiency
of new car sales has changed over time. There
was very little response of the median14 of the
mpg of new car sales to the gas price hike of
1973 until 1976. As discussed in Pakes,Berry,
and Levinsohn [18], this is largely because more
fuel efficient models were not introduced
until
that time, and the increase in gas prices had
little effect on the distribution
of sales among
existing models. The movement upward in the
mpg of new car sales that begain in 1976 continued, though at only a modest rate, until 1979.
Between 1979 and 1983 there was a more strik-

ing rate of improvement
in this distribution.
After 1983, the distribution
seems to trend slowly
downward with the gas price.
These trends are replicated, though in somewhat different intensities and years, in the downward movements in both the weight and horsepower distributions
of the cars marketed. There
is, then, the possibility that the increase in the
mpg of cars was mostly at the expense of the
weight and horsepower of the models marketed,
i.e. there w= no change in the mpg for given
horsepower-weight
(hp/wt) classes.
To investigate this possibility we calculated a

“divisia” index of mpg per hp/wt c1=s. That
is, first we divided all models into 9 hp/wt
classes,15 then calculated the annual change in
the mpg in each of these classes, and then took a
weighted average of those changes in every year,
the weights being the fraction of all models marketed that were in the class in the b=e year for
which the increase was being calculated.
This
index is given in column 2 of Table 6. It grew
rapidly in most of the period between 1976 and
1983 (the average rate of growth was 2.85% per
year), though there was different behavior in different subperiods
(the index fell between 1978
and 1980 and grew most rapidly in 1976 and
1977) .
We would expect this index to increase if either the firms moved to a different point on a
given cost surface, being willing to incur higher
production costs for more fuel efficient cars, or if
the gas price hike induced technological
change
that enabled firms to produce more fuel efficient
cars at no incre=e in cost. Comparing the movements in the mpg index in Table 6 to the time
dummies estimated in Table 5, we see little correlation between the mpg index and our estimates
of the Jt. 16. We therefore look at the possibility
that the mpg index increases were generated by
induced technological change. 17

Innovation.
As noted, another route by which changes in the
environment
can affect the automobile industry
is through induced innovation.
Table 3 showed
how some new technologies have been introduced
over time. The table shows that the simple catalytic converter was introduced immediately after the new fuel emission standards in 1975, and
lasted until replaced by more modern technol~
gies beginning in 1980.
Other than looking at specific technologies,
it is very difficult to measure either innovative
effort or outcomes,
and hence to judge either
the extent or the impacts of induced innovaPerhaps
the best we can do is to look

at those patent applications
that were eventually granted in the three subclasses of the international
patent cltisification
that deal with
combustion engines (F02B,F02D, and F02M: Internal Combustion
Engines, Controlling
Comand Supplying
Combustion
bustion
Engines,
Engines with Combustible
Materials
or Constituents Thereof).
A time series of the patents
in these subclasses is plotted in figure 2.
That series indicates that the timing of the
changes in the number of patent applications in
these classes is remarkably closely related to the
timing of both the gas price changes, and the
changes in emissions standards.
In the ten year
period between 1959 and 1968 the annual sum
of the number of patent applications
in these
cl=ses stayed almost constant at 312 (it varied between 258 and 346). There w= a small
jump in 1969 to 416, and between 1969 to 1972
(which corresponds
to the period when emissions standards
were introduced)
the number of
patents averaged 498. A rather dramatic change

occurred in the number of patents applied for
in these classes after the first oil price shock in
1973/74 (to 800 in 1974), and there average number between 1974 and 1983 was 869. This can be
divided into an average of 810 between 1974 and
the second oil price shock in 1979, and an average of 929 between 1979 and 1983. These later
jumps in applications
in the combustion engine
related classes occurred at the same time as the
total U.S. patent applications
fell, making the
increase in patenting activity on combustion engines all the more striking.
It seems then that the gas price shocks, and to
a possibly lesser extent the regulatory changes,
induced significant increties in patent applications.
Of course there is likely to be a significant and variable lag between these applications and the subsequent
embodiment
of the
patented ideas in the production
processes of
plants,
Moreover very little is known about
this lag.
What does seem to be the case is
that patent applications
and R & D expenditures have a large contemporaneous
correlation
(see [19]). However the attempts
at estimating
the lag between R & D expenditures
and subsequent productivity
incremes have been fraught
with too many simultalieity and variability problems for most researchers (including ourselves in
different incarnations)
to come to any sort of reliable conclusion about its shape.

Conclusions.
In this paper we provide some preliminary
evidence on the impacts of regulatory and gas price
changes on production
costs and technological
change. We find that. after controlling for product characteristics,
costs moved upwards in our
period (1972-1982) of rapidly changing gas prices
and increzed emissions standards.

References

When we introduce dummy variables for technology cl-es
we find that the simple catalytic
converter technology that was introduced
with
the first tightening of emission standards did not
have a noticeable impact on costs, but the more
advanced technologies that were introduced with
the second tightening of emissions stmdards did.
Moreover,
the introduction
of the technology
dummies eliminates the shift upwards in costs
over time. Thus the increase in costs appear to
be related to the adoption of new technologies
that resulted ill cleaner, and perhaps more fuel
efficient, cars.
The fuel efficiency of the new car fleet began
increasing after 1976, and continued this tend
until the early 1980’s, after which it, with the gas
price, slowly fell. Our index of mpg per horsepower weight CIWS also began increasing in 1976,
and, at least after putting in our technology variables, its incre=e was not highly correlated with
the index of annual costs that we estimate. Also,
patent applications
in patent clwses that deal
with combustion engines increased dramatically
after both increases in gas prices. These latter
two facts provide some indication that g= price
incre=es induced technological change which enabled an incre~e in the fuel efficiency of new car
models with only moderate, if any, increases in
production
costs.
In future work we hope to provide a more detailed analysis of these phenomena, as well as integrate (perhaps improved versions) of our hedonic cost functions with an anlysis of the demandside of the market (as in [7]). This ought to enable us to obtain a deeper understanding
of the
automobile
industry and its likely responses to
various changes in its environment.
