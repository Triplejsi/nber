EXCHANGE RATE PASS-THROUGH
AND INDUSTRY CHARACTERISTICS:
THE CASE OF TAIWAN’S EXPORTS
OF MIDSTREAM PETROCHEMICAL
PRODUCTS

ABSTRACT

Based on 1986-1992 survey data of 22 midstream petrochemical

industries in Taiwan, the

empirical results of the export price, the markup ratio and the price-cost margin equations in this
study show that Taiwan’s petrochemical

firms absorb only a small portion of a given weighted

exchange rate change in their export prices, markup ratios and price-cost margins.

It implies that

Taiwan’s petrochemical firms have a weak pricing-to-market pattern. The empirical results may be
explained by the volatility of profitability,

high market concentration

and small export/domestic

production share. However, the impacts of the exchange rate change on the export price, markup
ratio and price-cost margin have a tendency to increase during the period of 1987 to 1992. The
tendency might be attributed to increasing competition of the petrochemical

markets in the world,

or Taiwanese firms’ gradual realization of the importance of holding their world market shares in
response to the exchange rate change.

Most of the recent empirical studies show that firms in Newly Industrializing
Countries tend to have “pricing-to-market”

behavior in response to changes in real

exchange rates [Hooper & Mann (1989), Athukorala (1991), and Liu (1994), ...etc.].s
However, Marston (1990), Knetter (1993) and Athukorala & Menon (1994) find that
different industries even in the same country may not have identical behaviors toward
pricing-to-market.

Similarly, Krugman (1987), Dombusch

(1987),

Feenstra (1987), Fisher (1989), Knetter (1989) and Shinjo (1993) also show that the
elements of market structure are very important in determining the degree of exchange
rate pass-through.
There does exist a few studies which investigate the exchange rate pass-through
effects in Taiwan [Hooper & Mann (1989), Liu (1994) and Wu (1995)].

However,

most of them are based on an aggregative level. As mentioned above, if we study the
pass-through effect by examining the general aggregate price indexes, we might have
misleading results due to the negligence

of market structure elements.

In order to

avoid the aggregation problem, in this paper we use survey data on the exports of 22

elasticities of demand in order to emphasize the importance of market structure and
industry characteristics

in the studies of the exchange rate pass-through effects.q

A number of important features should be noted when discussing the exchange
rate pass-through

effects of Taiwan’s petrochemical

industry.

First, though it is a

large-scale industry in Taiwan, it only exports a relatively small portion of its total
output.5 Secondly, it is a highly concentrated industry, i.e., it owns a relatively strong
power of monopoly.

Therefore, we expect this kind of industry to have a lower

incentive to adjust its markup ratio in response to the changing of exchange rates
except for the purpose of holding foreign market shares [Froot & Klemperer (1989)].
By studying these particular industries’ exchange rate pass-through

effects, one can

not only examine whether all industries in Taiwan have manipulated the exchange rate
for the purpose of gaining an unfair competitive advantage in the international market,
but it also can provide us more information about industry-specific

pricing behavior.

In addition to this section, the rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Section

2 sets up the analytical framework for our empirical analysis of exchange rate passthrough and builds the empirical equations used in this study. Section 3 illustrates the
characteristics

of Taiwan’s petrochemical

industries and data description.

Section 4

presents and analyzes the econometric estimates of exchange rate pass-through effects.
The final section concludes the paper.

II. Analytical

Framework

As mentioned by Hooper & Mann (1989), exchange rate pass-through

can be

broadly defined as the extent to which a change in the nominal exchange rate induces

Kuo-Liang Wang&

a change in the import price. Since our analysis is focused on export price indexes, it
is natural to define the exchange rate pass-through

effect as the partial derivative of

export price indexes with respect to the exchange rate minus one.

In addition,

following previous empirical researches [e.g. Hooper & Mann (1989),Marston(1990),
Kim (1990), Athukorala (1991), Athukorala & Menon (1994)], we adopt a variant of
markup models of price determination.

In this kind of framework, we can discuss the

strategic interaction between domestic and foreign firms operating through variations
in the markup.
Under the assumption

of imperfect competition,

domestic firms more or less

have a capability to control their prices of output and set the home-currency

export

prices (PEX) at a markup (MK) over the level of normal unit production cost (MC):
PEX = (1 + A4K)A4C

combined,

share, and

market structure. In this study, the demand pressures in all markets are proxied by the
capacity utilization rate (CU). As the capacity utilization rate goes up, it implies that
total demand in all markets is increasing.

It is then easier for the domestic firms to

raise domestic and export prices above marginal and average costs.

The competitive

pressures in the foreign markets are represented by the price elasticities

of demand

with respect to domestic firms in foreign markets (EL) and the weighted exchange rate
(RX). The pricing theory tells us that other things being equal, the markup ratios are
inversely related to elasticities of demand.

Therefore, the higher the price elasticities

of demand with respect to the domestic firms in the foreign markets, the less possible
it is for the domestic firms to raise export prices above marginal costs.

As for the

exchange rate, it partially reflects the pressure of the foreign competitive

price and

partially reflects domestic firms’ pricing strategy toward foreign market share [Mann

(1986), and Froot&Klemperer

(1989)].

theory that the higher the level of domestic market concentration,

the more likely it is

that domestic firms will be able to raise domestic prices and, then, the export prices
above marginal and average cost [Khalizadeh-Shirazi

(1974)].

As a result, the markup

ratio function can be expressed as follows:

countries increases, the transportation

accident occurring during shipping will go up, and the domestic firms will tend to
raise export prices. Therefore, we add a transportation

For the markup ratio function, the regression results are shown in the middle
part of table 4. It can be seen that the results are very similar to those in the export
price equations.

The weighted exchange rate, capacity utilization rate, transportation

cost and market concentration rate all have significant positive effects on the markup
ratio. Though demand price elasticity has the right sign, it is insignificantly
from zero.

In

this way, we can get the elasticity of the markup ratio with respect to the weighted

The results of the price cost margin equation are

shown in the bottom of table 4. They are also very similar to those in the export price
and markup ratio equations.

The computed

elasticity of PCM with respect to the

weighted exchange rate is also around 0.19, which is very close to the findings of MK
equations. T Moreover, by referring to equation (A. 12) in the Appendix A, the positive

6, respectively.

Comparing

the exchange rate parameters between these two tables,

we find that when the coefficients are significant, the exchange rate parameters in the
second period are all almost twice as much as those in the first period.

The exchange

rate elasticity of MK or PCM in the first period was around 13°/0, and in the second
period it was about 30Y0.8 In table 7 we also present the rolling estimation for every
four years of each equation.

It can be seen from the table that exchange

elasticities of the estimated parameters do have the tendency to increase through time.
By referring to equation (A-12) in the Appendix A, it implies that when the elasticity

NOTES

1. It can be seen from table 1 that the average NT/US$

exchange

rate had been

decreasing from 36.84 in 1981 to 26.41 in 1989, which is over a 38.31 percent
appreciation.

However, during the same period the export price indexes dropped

from 111.68 to 97.40, only decreasing 12.79 percent.
2. Incomplete

exchange rate pass-through

is ofien mentioned

as one of the main

reasons for sluggish adjustment in the trade imbalance among countries.
3. For the case of Japan and other countries, please see Athulorala & Menon (1994),
Froot & Klemperer (1989), Knetter (1993), Marston (1990), Menon (1995), Ohno
(1989), etc.
4. Herfindahl Index is a measure of market concentration

or fewness, and is equal to

the sum of squares of the market shares of the firms in the market.
5. It can be seen from table 2 that there were 12 out of 22 industries whose average
export/domestic

production share was less that 10 percent during the period 1986

to 1992.
6. The sample mean of markup ratio during the period 1987 to 1992 is 0.737.
7. The sample mean of price cost margin for the sampling period is 0.333.
8, The sample means of MK and PCM for first period are 0.769, 0.359, and 0.706,
0.307 for second period, respectively.
9. Since 1985, accompanied

by the recovery of the world economy, petrochemical

industries world wide have vigorously expanded their production
increases the degree of competition among world petrochemical

capacity, which

In order to allow possible collusion between the domestic and foreign firms, we

from the foreign firm. Therefore, equation (A-5) becomes
