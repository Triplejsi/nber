THE DETERMINANTS OF THE CHOICE
BETWEEN FIXED AND FLEXIBLE
EXCHANGE-RATE REGIMES
ABSTRACT
In recent years, analysts and policy makers alike have been evaluating the nexus between
exchange rates and macroeconomic

stability.

Among the most important questions asked is why

have some countries adopted rigid, including fixed, exchange-rate regimes, while others have opted
for more flexible systems? This paper addresses this question from a political economy perspective,
both theoretically and empirically.
The model assumes that the monetary authority minimizes a quadratic loss function that
captures the trade-off between inflation and unemployment.

This framework is initially applied to

the case where monetary authorities must choose between a (permanently)

fixed and a flexible

exchange-rate regime. In selecting the regime, the authorities are assumed to compare the expected
losses under each scenario.

The model is subsequently

extended to cover the somewhat more

exchange-rate regimes.

and flexible

In this latter case, potential political costs of abandoning the pegged rate

are taken into account. In the empirical section, an unbalanced panel data set of 63 countries from
1980-1992 is used to estimate a series of probit models, with a binary exchange-rate regime index
as the dependent variable,

Among the most important explanatory variables were measures of

countries’ historical degree of political instability, various measures of the probability of abandoning
pegged rates, and variables related to the relative importance of real (unemployment)

targets in the

preferences of monetary authorities. The regression results support the political economy approach
developed in the theoretical discussion.

I. Introduction
In most developing and transitional economies, exchange rate issues have tended to
dominate macroeconomic

policy discussions during the last few years. In particular, attention

has focused on two broad problems: first, how to define, measure, detect and correct situations of

real exchange i-ate misalignment and overvaluation; and second, on understanding the
relationship between nominal exchange rates and macroeconomic
exchange rate misalignment

Issues related to rea/

have been central, for example, in debates that preceded the

devaluation of African currencies participating in the CFA franc zone in the early 1990s, in post
mortems of the Mexican crisis of December 1994, and in recent analyses of the Argentine
stabilization program of 1991.
Regarding the relationship between exchange rates and macroeconomic

stability, four

specific questions have attracted the attention of analysts and policy makers:
(a) Why have some countries adopted rigid, including fixed, exchange-rate
regimes, while others have opted for more flexible systems?;
(b) Do fixed exchange-rate regimes impose an effective constraint on monetary
behavior and, thus, result in lower inflation rates over the long run?;
(c) Are exchange-rate-based

stabilization programs superior to money-based

stabilization programs?; and,
(d) How should exchange-rate-based

stabilization programs actually be designed’?

The first two issues deal with the long run, while the third one is related to the short run,
transitional consequences of stabilization programs. 1 All four issues, however, have important
implications for a country’s macroeconomic

performance and growth. Moreover, most of these

questions are intimately related to political economy and institutional considerations.
This paper deals with the first question from a political economy perspective.

I ask. for

example, why does Austria have a fixed exchange rate, while the U.K. has a flexible one’? And.
why has Argentina chosen a fixed exchange rate, while her neighbor Chile has a flexible-cumbands system? More generally, in December 1992, why did eighty-four countries (out of 167
reported in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics) peg their currencies to a major currency

The theoretical discussion, presented in section II, emphasizes the role

of credibility, politics and institutions.

In the empirical analysis (section III) I use a large cross-

country, panel data set to analyze empirically the determinants of the choice of regime.

I assume that policy

makers minimize a loss function defined over a monetary variable -- inflation -- and a real
variable -- say, unemployment.

In order to simplify the discussion I initially assume that the

two alternative regimes are a flexible or a permanently fixed exchange-rate

system.

I then

extend the analysis to the case where the two options are a flexible regime or a pegged-butadjustable regime.

In this case I assume that the abandonment of the pegged exchange rate

entails important political costs.

II. 1 Fixed or Flexible ? A Simple Framework
Assume, for simplicity, that the monetary authority must choose between two nominal
exchange-rate

regimes: (permanently)

fixed or flexible.

Assume that the authorities take into

account the expected value of a loss function under the two alternative systems,

Consider the

case where the loss function is quadratic and depends on inflation (n) squared and on squared
deviations of unemployment

(u) from a target value (u*).* The model is given by equations (1)

through (5):

E(x) = X’, v(x) = 02.

Equation (1) is the loss function.

Equation (2) states that the observed rate of unemployment

(u) will be below the natural rate (u’) if inflation exceeds wage increases -- (n-m)> O -- and if
external shocks (x) are below their mean (x’). Variable x can be interpreted as a composite of
terms of trade and world interest rate shocks.

It is assumed to have a variance equal to 02.

Equation (3) establishes that the target rate of unemployment

u* is below the natural rate u‘,

Equation (4) implies that agents are rational in setting wage increases (a< O), and equation (5)
defines inflation as a weighted average of the rate of devaluation d and the rate of wage
increases u.

Under fixed rates d is by definition equal to zero, while under flexible rates the

authorities set d according to an optimal devaluation rule. 3

take up this issue in section III.

II. 2 Flexible vs. Pegged-but-Adjustable Excltange-rate regimes
The preceding analysis assumed that under a fixed regime the nominal exchange rate
would never be altered. This is, of course, a major simplification.

In reality, under fixed

exchange rates, governments always have the choice of abandoning the peg. This possibility can
be captured formally by assuming that the authorities follow a rule with some kind of escape
clause. In other words, the nominal exchange rate will be maintained at its original level under
certain circumstances.
abandoned.

However, if these circumstances change markedly, the peg will be

This means that at any moment in time there is a positive probability that the pegged

rate will be altered. This type of arrangement underlied the original Bretton Woods system that
ruled the international

monetary system from 1948 to 1973. According to the original IMF

Articles of Agreement, a country could alter its peg if it was facing a “fundamental
disequilibrium”.

In this section I sketch the analytics of this case.

Assume that ex ante a country can choose between two possible regimes: flexible nominal
rates (f) or pegged but adjustable rates (p). Also consider a two-period economy, where under a

pegged regime there is a positive probability that the peg will be abandoned at the end of the first
(or beginning of the second) period. The probability of abandoning the peg is denoted by q, and
the discount factor by ~. As in the preceding analysis, assume that the authorities have a distaste
for both inflation and for deviations of unemployment

from a target level.

Assume further that the authorities will incur a political cost equal to C if the peg is
indeed abandoned.

This assumption captures the stylized fact, first noted by Cooper (1971), that

stepwise devaluations have usually resulted in serious political upheaval and, in many cases, in
the fall of the government.4

The magnitude of this cost will, in turn, depend on the political and

institutional characteristics of the country, including the degree of political instability.

In

politically unstable countries a major economic disturbance, such as the abandonment of a parity
that the authorities have promised to defend, will tend to have major political consequences.

For

example, this can explain why the vast majority of stepwise devaluations take place during the
early years of an administration,

when its degree of political popularity is higher.~ The degree of

political instability will also affect the government’s discount factor. In more unstable countries
the authorities will tend to be more impatient, discounting the future more heavily. This means
that denoting the degree of political instability by p, we can write:

c = c(p); with C’ > 0,

(11)

P = P(P); with ~’ < 0.

(12)

In this two period economy, the loss function under flexible rates is (where the notation is
consistent with that used in the previous section):

their jobs within two months of the devaluation.

5 Using a broad sample of stepwise devaluations, Edwards (1994) found that in presidential democracies
77% of the devaluations took place within the first 18 months of new governments; this figure is 70% for
parliamentary democracies, and only 43% for undemocratic regimes.

where y is a parameter that captures the degree of distaste for inflation.

The loss function under a pegged rate regime is:

on the selection of the exchange-rate

regime, I do not specify explicitly the process governing the decision to use the escape clause.
As in equation (8) in the preceding section, the regime decision rule will be based on an ex
ante comparison between both loss functions:
K = E {LfleX- LPegged},

If K>O, then the pegged but adjustable regime is preferred.

K = y(~F)2 + p [(KF)2- (KP)2]~ ~ (]-q)
+ ~ (1-q)

Some simple manipulation

(15)

yields:

Y(7CF)L+I 2 +

P [(KF), +l 2- (Kp),
+l 2]- q~c.

b The rate of inflation will be higher under pegged-but-adjustable
regime than under the (unrealistic)
“forever” fixed system considered in section II. 1. This is because under pegged regimes the public’s expected
rate of inflation (in period 2) will explicitly take into account the probability that the peg will be abandoned:
E(i’cp),+l = q (nD),+, + (1 - q) (rip),+].

(16)

Where (K’)2 = (UF- u*) 2 and (Kp) 2 = (up - U*)2. From the analysis in the previous section it
follows that [(KF)2- (Kp)2 ]<0 and that [(K’),+, 2- (K’),+]2]< O. From equation(16)

it is

possible to derive a number of hypotheses regarding the likelihood of a country choosing a
pegged-but-adjustable

exchange-rate regime. A higher rate of inflation under flexible rates (in

either period) will increase the likelihood of a pegged regime being chosen. Moreover, with
other things given, a higher weight for inflation in the loss function -- that is a higher y -- will
also increme the probability of choosing a pegged exchange rate, On the other hand, an increase
in unemployment

volatility under pegged rates, generated by a higher variance in the foreign

shock -- a higher u’, from the previous section -- will increase the likelihood that a flexible
system will be selected. A greater distaste for unemployment

deviations -- that is a higher p --

will reduce the likelihood of selecting a pegged rate. Likewise, a higher cost of abandoning the
peg (C) will reduce the ex ante probability of selecting a pegged rate. Interestingly enough, a
higher probability of abandoning the peg -- a higher q -- will have an ambiguous effect on the ex
ante likelihood of choosing a pegged regime. This follows from the following expression:

K~= -~ y (nF)[+, 2- ~ p [(KF)t+l2- (Kp),+,2]- PC

(17)

Notice that the presence of political costs of abandoning the peg (C) increases the likelihood
that this expression will be negative, making it more likely that a flexible regime will be
selected.
An important question relates to the relationship between political instability and the
selection of the exchange-rate

regime.

In principle there will be two offsetting forces.

First, a

higher degree of political instability will increase the cost of abandoning the peg -- recall
equation (11 ) -- and thus will reduce the ex ante probability that a pegged regime will be
chosen.

Second, a higher degree of instability will increase the authorities discount rate

(equation 12), reducing the importance of “the fiture”
Formally:

(18)

While the first term is negative; the second can be either positive or negative, because the sign of
KP is indeterminate.

This means that the way in which instability will affect the selection of an

exchange-rate system is an empirical question.

I tackle this issue in the following section, where

I present the results of a number of probit regressions on panel data for 63 countries during 19801992.

Results

In this section I use a cross-country,

unbalanced panel data set from 1980-1992 to

analyze why some countries have adopted pegged exchange-rate regimes while others have
opted for more flexible systems.

I estimate a number of probit equations to investigate

whether, among other factors, a country’s political and economic structure,

In the empirical analysis they are defined as an average for the decade prior to the one

included in the analysis.

The second class of independent variables tries to capture, for each

country, the evolution of some key time series (see below for a discussion on how each
variable is actually defined).
Probit equations of the following type were estimated using an unbalanced panel data
set for 63 advanced and developing countries (see the appendix for the list of countries):

Measuring Political InstabiliQ
Most empirically-based

political economy studies have used rather crude measures of

political instability, including the number of politically motivated assassinations
(Barro 1991). Other studies have used the frequency

and attacks

-- either actual or estimated --of

government change as a measure of political turnover and instability (Cukierman et al. 1992). A
limitation of this type of measure, however, is that it treats every change in the head of state as an
indication of political instability, without inquiring whether the new leadership belongs to the
same, or opposing, party than the departing leader. In that sense, for example, the replacement of
a prime minister by another from the same party is considered to have the same meaning as a
change in the ruling p~y

(Cukierman

1992).

In this paper I use two alternative measures of political instability.

The first, POLINST,

corresponds to the most traditional approach, and is defined as the estimated frequency of
government change for 1971-1980.

This variable has been used by Cukierman et al (1992). This

variable is measured for 1971-1982, and is assumed to capture the inherent degree of political
instability of each country. The second measure, POLTRAN,

is a new index of political

instability that focuses on instances where there has been a transfer ofpower from a party or
group in office, to a party or group formerly in the opposition, also between 1972 and 1980.7
This index measures the instability of the political system by capturing changes in the political
leadership from the governing party (or group, in the case of non-democratic

In addition to the two indexes of political instability, three indicators were used as
proxies of the extent of weakness of the government

in office.

The first one refers to whether

the party or coalition of parties in office have the absolute majority of seats in the lower house
of parliament,

The second indicator of political weakness that we used is the number of political
parties in the governing coalition (NPC). This index takes a value of zero for monarchical or
dictatorial systems, and the number of parties participating

in ruling coalitions under

democratic regimes (that is, if there is a single-party government NPC will take the value of
one).

It is expected that the higher the number of parties in that coalition, the higher the

Other Data
According to the model presented in section II, in addition to the political factors
discussed above, other variables that capture structural characteristics
important in the process of selecting an exchange-rate

of an economy are

system.

External shocks. Two alternative indices were used to measure the extent of external
shock variability.

(a) A coefficient of variation of real export growth for 1970-1982, denoted

as CVEX, was constructed with raw data obtained from the IMF’s International Financial

Statistics (IFS). (b) A coefficient of variation of real bilateral exchange rate changes for 19701982, EXVAR, was constructed from data obtained from the IFS. The use of these variables
in the regression amlysis presents a potential endogeneity problem.

In order to minimize this

danger in the probit reported below, lagged values (for 1970-82) of these indexes were used.
It is expected that the coefficient of these variables in the probit regressions

will be negative,

indicating that, as reflected in equation (10), countries with a more volatile external sector will
tend to select a more flexible regime.
In principle,

the actual importance of external shocks should also depend on the degree

of openness of the economy -- more open countries are more “vulnerable” to external
disturbances,

In order to consider this effect I added an interactive term between external

variability and the degree of openness, denoted as VAR_OPEN.

The latter was defined as the

ratio of imports plus exports to GNP, and was constructed from data obtained from the IFS.

Degree of “Ambition” of the unemployment target: A cornerstone of the model
developed above -- and of most Barre-Gordon

types of model -- is the idea that countries with
objective will have an incentive to “tie their

own hands”, in order to solve their credibility problem. That is, with other things given, they
will have a greater incentive to select a pegged exchange-rate

system.

of abandoning the peg -- a higher q -- can, in principle,

affect the likelihood of selecting a pegged rate either positively or negatively.

Since it is not

possible to observe q directly, four variables that capture the probability of having a
devaluation were considered

in the empirical analysis: (a) the historical rate of inflation.

Variables representing

capital controls were taken

Notice that according to equation (17), in spite of the theoretical

ambiguity of the effect of a higher q on the selection of the exchange regime, in countries with
a high political cost of devaluing,

a higher q will reduce the likelihood that a pegged regime

will be adopted.
In addition to the variables of political instability, external shocks, and the probability
of devaluing, the log of income per capita (PCGDP) measured in 1989 dollars was included in

More advanced countries tend to have a greater degree of intolerance for itiation.

Also, it

has often been claimed that less advanced countries do not have the institutional and

III. 2 Results
Tables 1 and 2 contain the main results from the probit analysis.

The estimates in table

1 were obtained when pegl was used as the dependent variable; those in table 2 correspond

to

peg2. Table 3, on the other hand, contains the results obtained when ordy developing
countries were included in the sample.

Overall these results are very satisfactory and provide

broad support for the model developed in the preceding section.

Surprisingly,

perhaps, there

are few differences in the estimates obtained when the alternative definitions of dependent
variables were used.
The estimates obtained when the strict definition of pegged regime @egl) was used,

Two of the indexes of the degree of weakness of

the political system (NPC and COAL) are not significant; MAJ, on the other hand, is
marginally positive, suggesting that stronger governments will have a greater tendency toward
selecting a pegged system.

The intuition here is quite simple: stronger governments

will be in

a better position to withstand the political costs of a (possible) currency crisis and, thus, will
be more willing to adopt them.
The coefficients associated with the (lagged) indexes of external volatility -- EXVAR
and CVEX -- are also negative, as expected, and significantly so. What is particularly
interesting is that the coefficients of the interactive term between external variability and
openness (VAR_OPEN)

are significantly

positive.

This suggests -- somewhat puzzling -- that

as countries are more open, the importance of the external disturbance

in deciding the selection

of the exchange rate regime loses importance.
The estimated coefficients of the variables that capture the ability to maintain the peg

To the extent that historical growth is a good

to inflate”, this result can be interpreted as providing evidence in

favor of the “tying its own hands” hypothesis.

Countries with poorer performance

--

measured, in this case, by the historical rate of growth --will have a greater incentive to
renege on their low inflation promises and, thus, will benefit from adopting a more rigid
exchange-rate system,

In order to analyze the robustness of these results I used the yearly

difference between the rate of unemployment

and its long term historical average (1970-90) as

an alternative measure of the “temptation to inflate”.

Within the context of the credibility

view it would be expected that the estimated coefficient of this variable will be positive.

A

limitation of this measure, however, is that very few countries have data on unemployment.
For this reason, the results obtained from these estimates should be interpreted with caution.
In equation I of table 1, when the differential in unemployment

was substituted for the rate of

GDP growth, its coefficient was positive, as expected (O.113), and significant (tstatistic =2.65).9
Finally, the coefficient of log of per capita income is significantly negative, indicating

This result,

however, is highly influenced by the way in which the industrial countries -- and in particular
the ERM nations -- are classified.

suggests that countries with broader political coalitions -- and, in principle, with a weaker
political base will tend to favor a pegged exchange rate.

The interpretation

of the coefficients

on external volatility and on the ability to maintain the pegged rate are very similar to that of
table 1. In this case, however, the coefficient of the log of per capita income is positive and,
in two of the five equations,

significantly so. This sign switch is mostly the result of the fact

that in peg2 many advanced countries have been classified as having a pegged rate.

An important policy question refers to the relationship

between capital and exchange

These binary indexes, taken from Alesina et

restrictions on capital account transactions;
on current account transactions

practices are in effect . As can be seen, the results are quite interesting.

This

suggests that countries that impose restrictions on capital account transactions have a tendency
to select a pegged regime.

Also, the results suggest that once the existence of restrictions

are considered,

other types of restrictions do not play a major role

in the process of selecting the exchange-rate regime.

The other results in table 4 continue to

support, however, the main findings regarding the role of political and economic variables in
the exchange rate selection process.
