Specific quasi-rents build up in a wide variety of economic relationships, and are exposed to opportunism unless fully protected by contract. The recognition that such contracts are often incomplete has yielded major insights into the organization of macroeconomic exchange.

investment goes back earlY in the history

Marx, in Das Capital, saw in it a channel for the capitalist exploitation of labor:
“The knowledge, the judgement, and the will, which, though in ever so small degree, are practiced by the
independent peasant or handicraftsman [...] — these faculties are now required only for the workshop as a
whole. Intelligence in production expands in one direction, because it vanishes in many others. What is lost
by the detail laborers, is concentrated in the capital that employs them [...]” (as cited by Rosenberg 1965).
Simons (1944) took the opposite view, that it is labor that takes advantage of specificity to appropriate
capital: “Frankly, I can see no reason why strongly organized workers, in an industry where huge investment
is already sunk in highly durable assets, should ever permit a return on investment sufficient to attract
new capital or even to induce full maintenance of existing capital.” He provided an early analysis of the
resulting under-investment: “[t]he bias against new investment inherent in labor organization is important
[...]. Investors now face [...] the prospect that labor organizations will appropriate most or all of the earnings
[...]. Indeed, every new, long-term commitment of capital is now a matter of giving hostages to organized
seflers of complementary services .“

2A number of recent contributions have examined various implications of appropriable quasi-rents in
general equilibrium setting. Makowski and Ostroy (1995) highlight the key role that “appropriation” plays
in the efficiency of markets. Ramey and Watson (1996) analyze the interactions of the holdup problem and
effort incentivization in a matching model. More applied examples are MacLeod and Malcomson (1993), who
study the macroeconomic effects of employment contract forms that attempt to avert investment holdup;
Acemoglu (1996), who examines the effects of search-related incomplete contracting on human capital accumulation; and Robinson (1995), who looks at the economics and politics of labor-market institutions when
employment contracts are incomplete.

3A simple transaction that would overstep the need for contracting altogether is an exchange of factors
that allows a single agent to own both factors in a production unit. In the first two examples we develop
in section 2.2 below, this solution is made impossible by the fact that one side of the transaction involves
“inalienable” human capital. In the third example, it is limited by span-of-control and other limits to the
extent of vertical integration.

4The strict concavity of the Aut arky production function implies the presence of a tbird “quasi” factor.
This becomes relevant in the distributional analysis of section 4.1, where it is briefly discussed (see footnote
20).
5We implicitly assume that each type of factor in the production unit forms a coalition that bargains as
a single agent.
6An alternative specification of the “disagreement point “ in bargaining yields the Shaked and Sutton
(1984) sharing rule that allocates ~y” to each factor as long as neither factor z = 1,2 receives less than
(1 – ~~)pizi. (See Binmore, Rubinstein, and Wolinsky 1986 for a discussion of the foundational differences
between the two approaches). The discrete change in the way the opportunity cost (1 – ~i)p,zi enters the
Shaked-Sutton rule makes it less attractive for an “aggregate” model. Otherwise, our main conclusions do
not depend on the specific sharing rule.

‘See, e.g., Lindbeck and Snower (1986). In this context, appropriability finds its clearest expression in
the phenomenon of “strikes.” The only reason strikes put any pressure on employers is that it is costly —
for technological or legal reasons — to substitute outsiders for striking insiders, i.e. capital has some degree
of specificity with respect to labor. That is precisely the leverage used by insiders to improve their deal.

reason is that labor is “inalienable, ” while capital is not. Thus, when labor is appropriated, some capital may
be transferred to the worker to convince him to commit to a production unit; when capital is appropriated,
the reverse transfer of labor to capital is infeasible. Although, in practice, this may not constitute a perfect
