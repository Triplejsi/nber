1Adopting a diflerent tack, I{indleberger (1993) discusses the importance of finance to the outcome of wars
(for instance, Britain’s ability to mobilize financial resources after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 may explain
why, with one-third France’s manpower, it could defeat the French) and asks “Can Finance be relewnt to military
outcomes, as widely insisted on, but not to the course of economic development?”
‘The early studies have typically been cautious about their findings. For instance, Goldsmith (1969, p48)
writes “In most countries, a rough parallelism can be observed between economic and financial development if
periods of several decades are considered. There is no possibility, however, of establishing with confidence the
direction of the causal mechanism, i.e., of deciding whether financial factors were responsible for the acceleration
of economic development or whether financial development reflected economic growth whose mainsprings must
be sought elsewhere. ”

may only include countries that, ex post (i.e., in the latter half of the 1980s when the database was initiated),
have a reasonably sized stock market. This selection bias does not appear severe because the data set seems to
contain every country (we know of) that had a stock market at the beginning of the 1980s. Moreover, some of the
stock markets present in the datwet are miniscule in the late 1980s, suggesting that this may not have been an

would be most important in the case of countries with small stock markets in 1980, that based on the hypothesized
selection criterion, would have grown the fastest. This would induce a negative correlation between the size of
the stock market and growth. While such a correlation is not borne out ill the data, and the selection bias does
not directly predict any correlation for the interaction term, this suggests further caution about comparing the
coefficients of credit and equity market capitalization.
