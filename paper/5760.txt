MORTALITY

CONT~GENT

CLAIMS,

HEALTH CARE, AND SOCIAL ~SUR4NCE

ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the savings and health care impacts of mortali~

coniirzgenf claims,

defined here as income measures, such as annuities and life-insurance, under which earned income
is contingent on the length of one’s life.

The postwar increase in mandatory annuity and life-

insurance programs, as well as the rapid increase in life-expectancy, motivates a better understanding
of the effects that mortality contingent claims have on resources devoted to life-extension.

We

analyze the incentives that such claims imply for life-extension when resources may affect mortality
endogenously and argue that these incentives dramatically alter the standard conclusions obtained
when mortality is treated exogenously.

Introduction

The number of countries that have old age or survivor income programs
provided through the public sector has increased by almost five times since
1940—from

33 to 155.1

Although

the financing

of these programs

varies

widely across countries, the benefits are paid out almost exclusively in terms
of annuities and they often cover more than 90 percent of the labor force2.
Furthermore, private pensions add to the degree of annuitization of most

countries they constitute

about one-tenth

of

GDP, make up more than three-quarters of all social insurance in developed
countries, and have contributed to a quarter of the growth in total public
expenditures

since 1960.3 As a consequence,

small mortality effects have large

impacts on public expenditures: in the U. S., an extra year of living would
increase outlays by, at least, the annual size of Medicare and Social Security,
about one-third

of total federal expenditures.

Understanding

the impact of

such programs on investment in health is thereby important for assessing the
relationship between the dramatic increase in old-age life-expectancy,
the
postwar growth in mandatory annuity programs, and the rapid development
of medical care to extend the length of life.

Our main argument is that mortality contingent claims have important incentive effects on investments in health and that these incentives raise a rich
set of unexplored

questions.

Although

and thus not

affected by health investments, we argue that the rapid increases in expenditures on medical care inputs is very hard to interpret without treating mort alit y as endogenous. A major point we stress is that under such endogenous
mortality, there are feed-back effects between the two largest public programs
in many countries—health care services and old-age annuities; Medicare and
Social Security in the US.
Section 2 sets forth our basic model of life-extension,

in which length of

life may be extended through costly medical care or other resources. Many
economists seem to stress that since medical care is often highly subsidized,

First, we argue that public annuities induce excessive lifeexpectancy. An extreme, but illustrative, example of this incentive effect is

relevant to the recent explosion

in mandatory

annuity incomes, health care out lays, and life-expect ancy at the end of life.
Section 3 considers the non-standard interactions between public and private savings under a Pay-As-You-Go
(PAYG) Social Security program under
endogenous

mort alit y. Contrary to the case when mortality is exogenous,

our

model explains why private savings may respond positively to expansions in
mandatory savings programs. 7 An important factor determining the complementary nature of private and public savings is whether the public savings
are life-extending. If they are, more private savings may be needed to finance
old age living. A somewhat self-evident example is mandatory savings for
health care, such as Medicare in the U.S. By taxing the young for the care of
the elderly, such programs extend life beyond that which would be observed
in a free market.

Private savings may therefore be increased to finance a

longer life in old age.
Furthermore,

life-extending

savings programs such as Medicare

interact

positively with other programs dependent on the length of life, such as Social
Security. Thus, if the co-payment rate for Medicare were lowered, then this
would presumably raise Social Security outlays through longer living. The
incentives of life-extension

imply a feed-back

effect in the opposing

direction

as well: if annuity levels rise, the increases in medical care would take place.
This feed back, in turn, would raise the annuity outlays even more. In other
words, not only does subsidizing health care increase expenditures

social security also increases health

cheap because extending life generates more annuity receipts to finance the
life-extending care. Indeed, if T(M) is elastic, then both the quantity and
quality of life increase with care. The individual lives longer and enjoys more
consumption when extending life. 13
These annuity incentives imply that, holding overall wealth constant, lifeextension is excessive relative to lump-sum

savings when annuitized.

Figure

1 below indicates the opportunity sets in terms of feasible combinations of
wealth and lifetime (W, T) for a non-annuitized and an annuitized individual.
The annuitized opportunity set ranges from (YO + YIT(0), T(O)), when all
wealth is consumed, to (O, T(M), when all wealth is allocated towards lifeextension and ~ is the maximum feasible level of care defined by annuity
revenues equaling care outlays, Y. + Y1T(m) — ~ = O. More wealth has
to be given up for an extra year of life when there are no annuities because
life-extension

is not wealth generating.

This implies that the slope of the

frontier of feasible wealth and life-length combinations

is steeper for the non-

annuitized individual.

Now consider the optimal combination

as denoted

by

(WA, T~). If the individual faces the lump-sum tradeoff, as given by the nonannuit ized opportunity set, then he will reduce life-extension and increase
consumption by choosing (WN, Z’~) instead of (WA, TA). The fact that the
two opportunity

sets cross at the optimal annuity combination

means that the

lump-sum wealth is the same as that of the annuitized individual. In other
words, the difference in life-extending care is not due to wealth. The tradeoff

Public

Annuity

and Health

Care Programs

Subsidization of medical care interacts in important ways with the discussed
incentive effects of annuities. Most public health subsidy programs seem to
amount to mandatory

health care savings since relatively

larger taxes are

levied on the working young and relatively larger subsidies are paid to the
sicker old. Our results imply that public mandatory medical savings may
be complementary with private savings. To determine the savings effects
of subsidizing

life-extending

medical care, let ~ denote the fraction

of care

subsidized, and consider a demand function for medical care as a function
of health subsidies and annuity benefits M(j, Y) such that, ceteris paribus,
it responds positively

to both incentives for care: dM/d’,

dM/dY

2 0. The

central aspect of such subsidies is that they interact positively with the excess
extension of life induced by annuities, since the medical costs to be spread
across years of living are reduced.

In other words, the larger are the medical

care subsidies, the larger is the discussed incentive effect of annuities, since
the annuities drive the benefit of extension

and subsidies lower the cost of

such extension. Therefore, they may interact positively, so that the annuity
effect on medical care is determined by the level of the subsidy: d2M/djdY
2
0. Suppose that the budget for medical care and Social Security is balanced,
as in
NT[M(f,

with the previous special case of no public medical care being obtained when

programs is determined by

The second effect is again through the

change in the age distribution.
The third and last term reflects how much
medical expenditures increase due to the increase in the subsidy; it may
be positive or negative, depending

on whether or not medical care is elastic.

This implies that an increase in medical subsidies during old age may increase
private savings. Indeed, this may even be true if the lifetime is exogenous,
since if the rise in the subsidy increases outlays, then more money is needed
during old age.
The interesting fact is that the two programs

interact in total outlays.

When mortality is endogenous, medical subsidies affect annuity outlays since
productive medical care implies that an individual must be paid on his annuity longer: if the co-payment

rate for Medicare in the U.S. were to be lowered,

then Social Security outlays would presumably

increase. Furthermore,

there

are indirect effects in the opposite direction as well. If annuity levels were
to be increased, then medical care expenditures would increase as well, due
to the increased benefit of life-extension

when annuities raise the income re-

wards for living. 23 More precise 1y, the first effect of medical subsidies on the

Mortality

Con-

Claims Markets

This section discusses the implications

of our arguments for private markets

for mortality contingent claims in terms of limiting the life-extension

induced

by annuities and the price effects of such incentives.

4.1

Efficiency

and Indexation

In competitive insurance markets, where prices are driven down to minimum
average costs, fair prices obtain. Consider the illustrative case of no discounting when the price p(Y, M)

of an annuity of size Y under care M is given

by
P(Y, M)

= ~nhTh(Mh)Y

= YEITIM].

This is simply quantity times the unit price equalling the life-expectancy

efleci on the premium p. Optimal care balances, as before, the benefit from
income and living against the cost in foregone consumption, as in

~[vwY

+ v,] = Vw.

On the other hand, the socially efficient level of care is determined by taking
into account how the annuity price is affected by this same change in care,
as in
~[vwY

‘h dMh

+ v, - Vw] = &~Tkvw.

16

This balances the social benefits of those that end up in the health state (the
left-hand side) with the social cost it imposes on others in terms of a larger
premia (the right-hand

side).

Since private incentives imply that the left-

hand side is zero, efficient provision reduces life-extension in order to avoid
the negative external effects it has on others paying the premia.
Private markets may internalize such external effects.

The efficient ‘tax’

on life-extenders makes them pay the marginal harm imposed on all premium
payers.

If 13~is the tax-rate,

then 13~M~is the Pigouvian

Measuring

The Feed-Back

This section illustrates how to empirically

Effect of Annuities
assess the feedback effects of an-

nuities using standard aggregate data generated by an annuity roll. We use
data reported in Virga (1996) on the public pension program covering federal
employees in the U.S. who were hired before 1983, The Civil Service Retirement System ( CSRS). Figure 2 below shows survival functions for groups
differing in the amount of monthly

annuity pay they received while on that

pension roll. The data cover the fiscal years 1988-94 and are differentiated
by five levels of monthly annuity levels.
19

The annuities under CSRS are indexed relative to the CPI and are mandatory so that selection-issues are presumably of minor importance.2G The sizes
of these annuities are relatively large, as they combine Social Security and a
federal employee pension program. The data report ed in Virga (1996) were
presented in terms of yearly mortality hazard rates on the annuity role represent ed by CSRS across salary and annuity cells, with exceptionally

large

cell sizes ranging from about 1500 to 1.8 million. The data show that yearly
mortality hazards fall with annuity level and salary, each falling when controlling for the other. The lowest yearly hazard rates are about one-half
of the highest, across all cells. We used these hazard rates to compute the
annuity-dependent
survival curves reported in the figure. 27 The plotted survivals are for males, conditional on reaching age 57, and they display the
positive relationship between annuity pay and survival discussed above.
Although

these patterns may, of course, be confounded,

the data reported

by Virga show that they hold controlling for gender and salary levels, as well.
However, the key point of these survivals is to illustrate how relatively small
differences in survivals may nevertheless lead to relatively large incentive
effects. To compute these incentive effects, we decomposed the price increase
of an annuity due to an increase in quantity int o two components:

increases in the quantity. The three curves corresponds to three separate
quantity increases from YL= $500 per month to YH = $1250, $1750, and

21

Our arguments may imply important differences with the standard theory
of Ricardian equivalence. It is claimed there that inter-generational transfers have no real effects if children are altruistic towards parents or parents
towards children. This is not necessarily true under endogenous mortality. If
parents support children because they are altruistic, they have no artificial
intent ive to extend their lives. But if children support parents, our arguments
show that there may be excessive investment in health. Moreoverj if income
is redistributed
