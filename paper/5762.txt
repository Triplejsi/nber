~DIVIDUAL
F~ANCIAL DECISIONS
IN RETIREMENT SAV~G PLANS AND
THE PROVISION OF RESOURCES
FOR RETIREMENT
ABSTRACT

Proposals for mandatory private saving accounts differ in the degree of investment discretion
that they provide to individual savers, and in their provisions for annuitization of accumulated assets.
With respect to investment choices, some argue that individuals must be prevented from investing
too conservatively, and earning low returns over their accumulation period, while others argue that
individuals should be protected from recklessly investing their retirement assets. With respect to
annuitization, there is concern that individuals might not choose annuities and would thereby expose
themselves to a risk of outliving their assets in a privatized system. This paper draws on the existing
experience with 401 (k) plans and other defined contribution pension plans to provide evidence on
each of these issues.

We find that the share of401 (k) plan assets held in corporate equities has

increased substantially in recent years. We are only able to provide limited evidence on participant
asset management,

since many 401 (k) plans have limited options in this regard.

We do find,

however, that a participant’s education and income levels are related to asset allocation decisions,
with less educated and lower income participants less inclined to invest in equity securities. We also
analyze a unique data base on TIAA-CREF participants and find several attributes of annuitization
behavior that seem inconsistent with standard behavior in the lifecycle model.

to grow as a resdt of roll-over contributions from other retirement plans, and the increase in

that nearly $1 trillion was held in IRAs.

The results are

The HRS findings are broadly consistent witi those from the SIPP. For IRAs, the HRS
data suggest that 36.1 percent of respondents have an IRA or an IRA and a 401 (k) plan. Of
the 8.4 percent of the respondents who are shown as “other multi~e”

doas not represent the optimal consumption @icy in the presence of lifetime
uncertainty, except in special cases. When period-by-period utility is given by U = log c,, and
the individual’s time preference rate is zero, for example, the optimal consumption profile
involves consuming wealth/(life expectancy) in each period. We focus on this consumption
rule even in cases when it is not optimal because it is a simple rule, analogous to some
withdrawal roles from retirement saving accounts such as IRAs, that individuals might easily
implement.

-cc:
Authors’ tabulatifrom 1992 Survey of Consumer Finances. SCF reWondents
with IRAIs ara asked wbti
their assets are held in various asset categwies, such as “Bank
Accounts, CDs, ~
Money Market Funds,” “Stocks, - “Bonds,” “A Com~tim
of Stocks
and Hs,”
etc. TM fraction holding stocks is computed by adding together all holdings of
those who rem
that they hdd stocks, and 1/N times the holdings of those who re~ing
investing
in c~tions
of N assets, one of which is stocks. For example, half of the assets
of indivm
reporting “A Combination of Stocks and Bonds” is added to the equity total.
For 401 (k), 403(b), and other defined cmtribution pension fund investments, tha options are
“-y
in stocks, “ ‘mostly b bonds, and “split bet wean. ” We add those as~ts that are
hdd mostly in stocks to half of the assets that are “split between” to compute the total equity
invastmant in these accounts.
The 401 (k) and 403(b) category also includes assets in
Supplemental Retirement Accounts; the Traditional DC Pension Plan entries include ESOPS and
profit sharing plans.
