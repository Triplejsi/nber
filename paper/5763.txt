THE WAGES AND LANGUAGE SKILLS
OF U.S. IMMIGRANTS

ABSTRACT
This paper finds that immigrants on average earned about 50 cents an hour less than nativeborn Americans in 1989. Immigrants from some regions earned considerably more than natives,
while others, especially from Mexico, earned much less. This paper also finds that when immigrants
first arrive in the U.S. they earn significantly less than native workers, but they close the gap by
about 0.8 percentage points with each added year of residence.
immigrant

As a result, the wage of the typical

who arrived in the 1950s and 1960s eventually surpassed the average native wage.

Improvements in English language skills contributed 6 to 18 percent of this narrowing, depending
on sex and education level. The remainder came from unmeasured sources of assimilation.
However,

since the 1950s and 1960s the wage gap between natives and newly arrived

immigrants has widened by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points annually.

Because they start with a larger

the average wage of more recent immigrants may never exceed the average native

wage. A decline in the average education of newly arrived immigrants accounts for 4 to 23 percent
of the starting wage gap, and shifts in the source countries of new immigrants from Europe to Latin
America and Asia accomt for 73 to 95 percent. Changes in English skills and in other factors have
played little role in this relative decline.
This analysis also finds a significant return to English skills.

Even afier controlling

for

education, region of origin, and years of U.S. residence, workers are rewarded for speaking English
well. Differences between each of the five English skill categories reported in the Census data are
about the same as the return to an additional year of schooling.

THE WAGES AND LANGUAGE SKILLS OF U.S. IMMIGRANTS
Geoffrey

Carliner

I. Introduction
Recent public discussion of the role of English in the U.S. has called attention to the
language skills of immigrants.

This paper e *S

how the wages of immigrant workers

relative to U.S. natives have changed since the 1950s. I estimate how improvements in the
English skills of immigrants have contributed to the catching up (assimilation) that ~
with increased residence in the U.S. I also estimate the trend in the relative wages of newly
mived immigrants (cohort eff~t) and the contribution of changes in country of origin,
education, and other tigrant

characteristics to this frend.

A large literature, smeyed

by Borjas (1994), uses data fim

two or more cross

section samples to estimate the relative -gs

of native-born and immigrant workers. This

literature finds that when immigrants fit

they earn less than native U.S. workers, but

tive,

immigrants reduce this earnings gap with increased U.S. residence and often overtake native
workers. However, the relative earnings of new cohorts of immigrants have been falling over
time, partly because the average skills of new immigrants have declined relative to natives’
skills (a moving target) and partly because the relative wages of less skilled workers, native
or immigran~ have fallen since the 1970s.
Another literature has used single cross section samples to estimate the effect of
language skills on immigrants’ earnings. Much of this research has fwussed on Hispanic men
in the U.S., but other immigrant groups and other measures of labor market perfo~ce

have

also received attention. McManus, Godd, and Welch (1983), Grenier (1984), Tainer (1988),
Kossoudji (1988), McManus (1990), Rivers-Batiz (1990), (1991), (1992), Chiswick (1991),

2
Bloom and Grenier (1992), Chiswick and Miller (1992), Daneshavry et al (1992), and
Chiswick (1993) all report that immigrants receive substantial returns for their English
language skills, both before and tier holding other c~stics

constant. Although point

estimates vary by sample, measures of language skills, and other aspects of specificatio~ all
these studies find significant returns to English skills.
Other studies report similar re~ts

for other ~iving

wuntries.

Carliner (1981),

Chiswick and Miller (1988), Bloom and Grenier (1992), and Chiswick and Miller (1992) find
that immigrants to Canada earn a significant wage premium for speaking English or French.
Chapman and Iredale (1993) and Chiswick md Miller (1995) for Adia

and ~

(1994) for Gemany find that immigrants receive substantial returns to speaking or writing the
dominant language of those countries.
None of these studies examines changes in immigrants’ language skills in a way that
distinguishes between changes in the skills of newly tived

immigrants (mhort changes) and

changes that occur with increased residence in the host mun~

(assimilation).

They also do

not estimate the contribution of these two types of changes in language skills to earnings

II. Measuring Assimilation
Immigrants typically arrive in the U.S. with less human capital than natives, and when
they ti

enter the U.S. labor market they ~ive

lower wages. On average, immigrants have

slightly less schooling than native workers. They edso know less about American customs
and work practices when they tive.

English skills are generally weaker, and they do

not have as wide a network of friends and relatives to learn of job openings.
With increased residence in the U.S., immigrants dly

types

knowledge of U.S. labor market practices, and ofien

invest time and effort in learning better English. As a resd~ additional experience has a
greater effect on immigrants’ wages than on natives’ wages, and the gap between them
narrows. Whether immigrants eventually overtake natives is a question of some dispute. In
any case, the freer growth in wages for immigrants than for natives is a measure of
assimilation.
Over calendar time, other fxtors also W@ the relative wages of immigrants and
‘

natives. The human capital of newly arrived immigrants may change, including average
educatio~ English language skills, the distribution of source counties, and other
characteristics.

Changes in U.S. immigration law, especially in the 1%0s, and political aud

economic changes in many countries around the world have resulted in large shifi in the
home countries of immi~ts

over the past 30 y-.

Shifts in labor demand may also raise

4
or lower average wages for all workers over time. Improvements

intechnology,

and increases

in physical and human capital have historically raised wages over long periods, though
perhaps not in the recent past.

model, az is the rate of assimilation, and as captures the simple trend in the human capital of
newly arrived immigrants.

Not all researchers have used this model to _te

assimilation and mhort effmts.

Early studies, for example Chiswick (1978) and Carliner (1980), relied on cross section da~

inwhich

YRM and YSM were not separately identifi~

same for all obsemations.

sinw YSM = T - YRM and T is the

Because of data availability, most studies of the wage effwts of

language skills have also used one cross section. These studies implicitly assumed

that cohort

effects are zero, which may have been reasonable for immigrant flows from World War 11

5
until 1970 but does not seem to be true for flows since then. Fortunately, it is now possible
to pool cross sectional data sets. This allows identification of both assimilation and mhort
eff=ts.
Equation (1) is designed to measure how much entering immigrants earn relative to
natives, not how much they earn relative to natives with similar c~stics.

Therefore it

does not include measures of their human capital, including their education and coun@ of
origin. If the average schooling of new immigrants fell sharply over calendar time, their
wages relative to natives’ would fall, and the mmlber of years of residence required for
catching up with natives would rise. But the estima~ of UJ in an equation which included
education or other personal characteristics would not reflect changes in the human capital of
new immigrants, and therefore such variables are not included in equation (1). A measure of
experience must be included in the equatio~ however, since the cohofi of immigrants who
an-ived in year t is aging but the stock of natives is not. Failing to mntrol for experience
would attribute all the wage growth of immigrants to assimilation and none to the normal
process of wage growth over the life cycle.
Equation (1) will answer the question of how fast assimilation wurs

III. Data
The data used to estimate these equations come firn the 1980 and 1990 Census of
Popdation.

Individuals were included in the regressions if they were between 18 and 64

years old, worked at least 40 weeks during the year -g
positive hours each week. The wage rate was calhted

the _

and usually worked

as inmme earned during the

preceding year, in 1989 dollars, divided by weeks worked last year times usual hours worked
per week. Individuals whose wage in 1989 dollars was less than $1.50 per hour were
excluded tim

the sample.

Census data include the in-al

in which immigrants entered the U.S. but not the

exact year. The midpoints of these internals were used to define a wntinuous measure of
YRM, set equal to zero for the earliest immigrants in the sample. YSM was defined as the
Census year of the obsemation minus the midpoint of the intexval, and Agem was defined as
age in the Census year minus YSM. Immigrants who arrived before 1950 were dropped fim
the sample, since YRM, YSM, and Agem add

not be measured with any precision for this

open ended category.
The 1980 and 1990 Censuses (but not earlier Censuses) asked respondents if they
spoke English only, very well, well, not well, or not at dl.

I used this Wormation to create a

mntinuous measure of English skills similar to a grade point average, with 4 for speaking
only English and O for speaking no English.

IV. Cohort ●nd Assimilation Effects
To estimate cohofi and assimilation eff~ts on the wage gap &een

immigrants and

natives, I estimated a version of equation (1). The dependent variable was the log of the
hourly wage. The independent variables included YRM, YSM and YSM _
and Experience squared, and dummy variables for immigrants and for obations

Experience
firn the

1990 census.
Equation (1) implicitly assumes that shifts in labor demand over time tiect
immigrants and natives similarly. For the decade of the 1980s, this is probably not true.
Katz and Murphy (1992), Levy and Murnane (1992), and others have documented the shifi in
labor demand in favor of highly skilled workers. Since immigrants are less skilled than
mtives, their wages have stimed

more during the 1980s tim

the shifi in labor demand.

Constraining period effects to be the same for immigrants and natives will therefore yield
underestimates of assimilation.

h

alternative is to allow as, the coefficient on the year of

the observation, to vary by education category. To the extent that immigrants and natives
with the same education compete in the same labor markets, this approach will control for the
increased wage inequality bemeen 1980 aud 1990. If immigrants are less skilled than natives
with the same educatio~ this approach will still underestimate assimilatio~ though by less
than constraining period effm

to be equal for all workers.

The disadvantage of estimating period effmntrols for changes over tie

_ly

by skill level is that it

in the distribution of immigrants among education categories.

11
Thus any change in the percentage of irnmigranu who were, for example, high school
graduates, would not be measured as a change in quality, though ,changes in average
education within each category wodd still be reflected in ~

for workers with and without schooling

beyond high school. For both sexes and education groups, the dts

indicate that natives

earn significantly higher wages than new irnrnigrants. Natives’ advantage is mnsiderably
larger over less educated immigrants of both sexes than over immigrants with postsecondary
schooling. For men, the gap between natives md new immigrants is about 11 percent for
workers with more than high school and 15 percent for high school or less. For women the

differences are 10 peunt

and 18 percent for the two education groups.

The resdts also indicate a trend increase in the wage gap keen
immigrants of about 0.2 percentage points per Aendar

natives and new

year for women aud for men with

postsecondary schooling and an annual decline of 0.6 percentage points for men with high
school or less. During the 25 years between the change in immigration laws in the 1960s and
the 1990 Census, the wage gap for such men widened by 15 percen~e

points. On the other

hand, immigrants’ wages grow more rapidly with experience than the wages of natives. Each
additional year of residence in the U.S. increases immigrants’ wages relative to natives’ by

..

about 0.8 percentage points. This rate of catching up is slightly larger for women than for”
men and more concave for the well eduti

but surprisingly similar across sex and

Table 2 also presents coefficients tim

regressions including all men ~d ~1 women.

These estimates assume, implausibly, that shim in labor demand during the 1980s aff~ted the
wages of immigrants and natives similarly. Compared with the regressions by education
category, they show a smaller wage decline during the decade for me~ and a wage increase
instead of a wage decrease for women. Because it und~

labor demand on immigrants’ wages, this specification also yields higher estimates of the
downtrend in wages for new immigran@ and smaller ~

s of the rate of atching up.

The worsening position of immigrants on arrival makes it harder for them to catch up
with natives. Table 3 presents estimates, derived bm

the coefficients in Table 2, of the

number of years required for average immigrants arriving in 1955, 1965, 1975, and 1985 to
ovetie

natives, by sex and education category. Male immigrants with Pomndary

schooling who arrived in the U.S. in 1955 codd expect to earn as much as natives within 12

years, while similar immigrants who arrived in 1985 would require 21 years for overtaking.
According to these estimates, the typical male immigrant without postsecondary schooling
who arrived in 1955 overtook the typical native worker after 19 years. However, by 1985 the
number of years to overtaking was 46, about as long as a high school graduate works in a
lifetime. Immigrant women required fewer years to overtake native womeu but the pattern
was similar. Those with Po-ndary

schooling who arrived in 1955 caught up with similar

immigrants who tived in the 1970s and the 1980s. The coefficients on these interaction
terms were generally insignificant for men and small and negative for wornen. T’hey suggest

Borjm (1994) and Jasso and Rosenzweig (1986) have suggested that immigrants from

Among less educated men, immigrants from Europe and from English speaking countries do

V. Changes k English Skills, R@orI of Originj md Education
English skills, region of orig~

and education are dl important in explaining wage

differences among immigrants, but how important are they in explaining changes in the

16

since the 1960s? How much have chauges in these

Answering these questions requires estimating equations (5) md (6), which ~lai.n
how individual characteristics change with year of migration (YRM) and with years sinu

point average to estimate short

This shifi in region of origin has been accompanied by a small decline in the average
education of new irnmigran~.

As Table 6 show

in 1990 immigrants who entered the U.S. in

the 1950s reported having 12.9 years of education on average, wmpared with 11.5 years for
immigrants who tived

during the 1980s. This decline in the average education of

immigrants over time wntrasts sharply with the average education of natives, which has
increased considerably since the 1950s.6
Immigrants’ place of birth does not change with increased U.S. residence, but
education may. Many immigrants come to the U.S. with their parents and attend school as a
matter of course. Others come in order to attend universities, and then decide to remain in
the U.S. permanently.

of natives is beyond the scope of this paper. However, it is intig
i.mrnigrantgroups

to note that among

withless education than nativ~ individuals who arrived as children receive

more schooling than those who arrived as addts.

M shown in Table 7, Mexicans who

immigrated when they were 10 years old or less had 11.3 years of school@
for those who arrived when they wm 26 or older. By an-

versus 6.7 years

with more education than natives, the reverse is true. South Aians who were 10 or younger
on tival

had an average of 14.8 years of education versus 15.5 years for South Asti

who

were 26 or older when they arrived. Assimilation seems to involve a regression towards the
mtive mean. It is aIso interesting to note that the return to a year of foreign schooling is
worth about 7 percent less than a year of U.S. schooling, a small but statistically significant
difference.’

declined by 1.4 years.

as the lower of age at migration minus 6 or total
years of education. This variable was included in a wage regression along with total years of
education, education squared, and the other variables shown in Table 4. AS noted above,

These changes were then mdtiplied by the appropriate coefficients in the wage

regressions in Table 4 to produce the contribution of each variable. These mntributions were
then divided by the total whort and assimilation effmts, calculated ~rding

to section II.

Table 8 reports these shares by sex and education category. These dcdations
indicate that improvements in English language skills wntribute about 16 to 18 percent to the
narrowing of the wage gap between male immigrants and natives that occurs with increased
U.S. residence, and about 6 to 10 percent for female immigrants.

Most of the assimilation

seems to be the result of increases in other forms of human capital by immigrants, for
instance better knowledge of U.S. work practices or greater ability to fid well paid jobs.
The restits aIso indicate that changes in the English skills of new immigrants have had little
effmt in their declining relative wages over time. The -d

decline in their education has

been substantially more importan~ but by fiu the most imprtant
decline has been the shifi in source muntries away fim

VI. Conclusions
The average immigrant earns about 50 ~ts

less than the average native worker, but

many immigrant groups in the U.S. eam higher wages than native wofiers and mauy have
higher average education. Furth~ore,

the majority of immigrant workers speak English well

or very well. Chdy among Latin Ameriean itiwmlts

do a substantial tirity

~rt

speaking English not well or not at all.
When they first anive in the U.S., Hgrants

earn significantly less than natives.

With each year of added residence in the U.S. this wage gap naITows by about 0.8 percent.
As a result, the wage of the typical immigrant who arrived in the 1950s and 1960s eventually
surpassed the average native wage. This overtaking occurred more quickly for women and
for well educated immigrants, but it also occd

for less educated men. Improvements in

6 to 18 percent of this narrowing, depending on sex and

education level. The remainder came from unmeasured sources of assimilation.
However, since the 1950s and 1960s the wage gap between natives and newly arrived
immigrants has widened by 0.2 percent to 0.6 -t

annually. Because they start with a

larger disadvantage, on average more recent immigrants may never ~

more than natives. A

decline in the average education of newly arrived immigrants accounts for 4 to 23 percent of
the starting wage gap, and shifi in the SO-

muntries of new immigrants km

Europe to

Latin America and Asia account for 73 to 95 percent. Changes in English skills and in other
fmtors have played little role in this relative decline.
This analysis also finds a significant return to English skills. Even -
