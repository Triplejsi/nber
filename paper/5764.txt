WHAT DOES THE BUNDESBANK

TARGET?

ABSTRACT

Although

its primary ultimate objective is price stability, the Bundesbank

has drawn a

distinction between its money-focus strategy and the inflation targeting approach recently adopted
by a number of central banks.

We show that, holding constant the current forecast of inflation,

German monetary policy responds very little to changes in forecasted money growth; we conclude
that the Bundesbank is much better described as an inflation targeter than as a money targeter. An
additional contribution of the paper is to apply the structural VAR methods of Bemanke and Mihov
(1995) to determine the optimal indicator of German monetary policy: We find that the Lombard rate
has historically been a good policy indicator, although the use of the call rate as an indicator cannot
be statistically rejected.

Introduction
In the past few yea~s a significant ntier

of central banks--

including those of Canada, New Zealand, Britain, and Sweden--have
adopted some form of “inflation targeting” as a framework for monetary
policy.

In an inflation targeting regime, the central bank and/or the

government announce explicit goals for the inflation rate, usually at
several horizons.

Although attaitunent of the inflation target does not

necessarily exclude other objectives, such as short-run stabilization of
output or exchange rates, meeting the inflation target at medium and
long horizons is treated as the overriding goal of policy.1
As a strategy for conducting monetary policy, inflation targeting
has some appealing features, including

(perhaps) greater ease in

explaining policy objectives to the public and the avoidance of the
“velocity instability” problem that can arise when policy relies heavily
on a single intermediate

target.

On the other hand, potentially

serious

problems with inflation targeting include the difficulty of making
accurate inflation forecasts and reduced accountability

arising from the

substantial lags between policy actions and inflation outcomes.
Because inflation targeting bears great promise but also
significant risk for its adopters, it would be most useful to know how
this strategy has worked in practice.

Unfortunately,

adoptions of inflation targets by industrial-country

the explicit
central banks have

all occurred within the last five years or so, so that the relevant
experiences are short.

A possible exception to this statement--which

motivates this paper--is the case of Gerrnany.2 Since the end of 1974,
the Bundesbank has conducted monetary policy in a framework that is

officially designated as money targeting-- and in which money growth
rates certainly play an important role--but which also appears to have
significant elements of inflation targeting.

As von Hagen

(1995) and

others have emphasized, and as we discuss furthe~ in Section 3, from the
inception of the current regime the Bundesbank has used a projection of
inflation for the next year as the main input to its derivation of its
money growth target.

Except for a small blip in 1980, this inflation

projection has been low and steadily declining; since 1986 it has been
constant at 2% per year, the level the Bundesbank deems consistent with
“price stability”.

Thus it might be argued that inflation goals, rather

than money growth targets, are the driving force behind German monetary
policy.

This conclusion would not be grossly inconsistent with the

German public’s perception of the Bundesbank’s behavior, nor with the
Bundesbank’s

1957 charter, which designates the safe-guarding of the

currency as the bank’s prime responsibility.

distinction between inflation taxgeting, as adopted by the U.K. and
others, and its own money-focused

approach; and it argues that the

latter, if feasible, is the superior strategy.

To make the

question more precise, we consider the following thought-experiment:
Suppose that the Bundesbank were to observe money growth coming in
higher than expected, but (because of offsetting factors) its forecast
of inflation did not change,

Then would the Bundesbank tighten policy?

If not, we would say that for most intents and purposes the Bundesbank
is an inflation targeter.

If it did tighten, then we would classify it

indicators of the stance of monetary policy, e.g., short-term interest

Non-policy variables include other

economic variables, such as output and inflation, whose responses to
monetary policy shocks we would like to identify.
With respect to the identification of monetary policy shocks and
their effects on the economy, there are two cases of interest.

The

first possibility is that there exists a single variable which is known
a priori to contain the relevant information about the stance of
monetary policy; i.e., P is a scalar, say P,

Under this assumption the system

(2.1)-(2.2) can be written

in VAR format by projecting the vector of dependent variables on k lags
of itself.

Estimation of the resulting system by standard VAR methods,

followed by a Choleski decomposition of the covariance matrix

(with the

policy variable ordered last) yields an estimated series for the
exogenous policy shock Vp.

Impulse response functions for all variables

with respect to the policy shock can then be calculated, and can be
interpreted as the true structural responses to policy innovations.
It is worth emphasizing the substantial advantage of this
approach, relative to traditional Cowles methods and more completelyidentified VAR analyses, that responses to policy can be measured
without identifying assumptions other than the timing assumption.
However, this methodology does require that one accept the idea that
there are exogenous shocks to monetary policy, uncorrelated with the
current state of the economy.

The appendix to this paper illustrates

how such shocks could arise from plausible sources, such as imperfect
current information on the part of the central bank or

shifts in central

bank preferences.

Second, although it may be that a

scalar measure is ultimately appropriate, the econometrician may be
uncertain about which variable or set of variables is the best measure
of monetary policy, and would like to compare alternative possibilities
statistically.

As we demonstrate in the application below, this

situation is also acconunodated by a non-scalar P, taken in this case to

Bernanke

(1995) emphasize that, in order to develop a reliable

indicator of monetary policy, it is important to understand the central
bank’s operating procedure and instruments.

In general, using a

variable that the central bank allows to respond to reserves-market
shocks as a policy indicator will lead to incorrect inferences about the
effects of policy changes on the economy.

(The appendix illustrates

this point by means of an algebraic example in which the central bank
may target either money or interest rates.)

Although Bundesbank operations have become increasingly similar

to those of the Fed over time, however, historically there are some
important differences.

The Fed has used open-market operations in

government securities as its principal tool of reserves management

for

many decades; relatively speaking, the Fed’s other tools–-its ability to
set conunercial banks’ reserve requirements and to make loans through the
discount window--have played a minor role in monetary policy.

Thus, at the
between the

1970s and the 1990s are not large.
In contrast, the Bundesbank has seen considerably more evolution
in its instruments of policy.

Prior to about 1980, the German central

bank did not make frequent use of open market operations.

Instead, in

the earlier period it implemented desired changes in the stance of
monetary policy, for the most part, in one of

three ways:

First, it made relatively frequent changes in reserve requirements
(which are fairly high in Germany, compared to other countries) .

Some

indication of the active use of reserve requirements is given by Figure

Finally, the Bundesbank could affect the quantity of loans through

In the earlier period

the Lombard rate was typically held below the market rate for reserves
(the call rate), but above the discount rate, and thus functioned
analogously to the U.S. discount rate.

Thus the Bundesbank lacked the ability, enjoyed by

the Fed, of finely targeting market interest rates.

However, over the

last fifteen years that situation has changed, for two principal
reasons.

increasing use of U.S. -style open-market operations.

These two

developments have greatly increased the Bundesbank’s ability to “finetune” movements in market interest rates, such as the call rate.
Indeed, in a short-term operational sense, the Bundesbank is able now to
target the call rate or other rates (such as the repo rate) in very much
the way that the Fed pegs the federal funds rate.

11

What implications do the changes in Bundesbank instruments and
operating procedures have for the choice of a monetary indicator for
Germany?

A tentative conclusion is that it may be somewhat risky to use

the call rate (or other short-term market rate) as one’s indicator of
monetary policy, at least prior to 1980 or so.

Because the Bundesbank

lacked the tools to target open-market interest rates precisely, it
seems possible that short-term innovations in market rates might have
reflected non-policy factors in the economy, such as shifts in the
demand for reserves, as well as policy innovations.

If shocks to the

call rate reflect non-policy influences, then measured impulse responses
to call rate innovations are no longer “clean” estimates of the effects
of monetary policy shocks on the economy.
A bit of indirect evidence on this issue is the persistence of the
For example, Sims (1992) found (both for

“price puzzle” for Germany.

Germany and other countries) that the price level rises following a
positive innovation to the call rate, despite the presumption

that an

increase in the call rate represents a tightening of monetary policy.
Sims finds that this perverse response of prices persists for Germany
even when commodity prices and the exchange rate are included in the
system to control for anticipated future inflation.

Sims’s sample

begins in 1961, and thus includes a lengthy period prior to the
introduction of repos and the expanded use of open-market operations.
However, Clarida and Gertler

(1995) estimate VARS with German data

beginning in the mid-1970s and also find a positive response of prices
to call rate innovations.
These considerations

We present further evidence below,
suggested to us that it might be worthwhile

to make a closer empirical examination of the Bundesbank’s operating
procedures.

We found that, with some conceptual re-definitions,

we

could apply the model of the reserves market proposed by Bernanke and

(2.7) relates the innovation in the demand for bank

reserves to the innovation in the call rate (analogous to the federal
funds rate in the U.S.) and an autonomous shock to reserves demand.

For

simplicity, we abstract here from the Bundesbank’s use of reserve
requirements as a policy tool:

Hence we measure total bank reserves as

required reserves at 1974 ratios (equal to central bank money at 1974
ratios less currency in circulation), plus excess reserves.

This

adjustment, albeit somewhat crude, does eliminate the large jumps in
reserves associated with changes in the legal requirements.
Equation

(2.8) assumes that, in innovations form, the demand for

Lombard loans (analogous to discount-window borrowing in the U.S.)
depends on the spread between the call rate and the Lombard rate
(analogous to the U.S. funds rate-discount rate spread) and a shock to
desired Lofiard borrowing.
U.S. discount-window

A difference between Lombard borrowing and

borrowing is that --as noted above--since

1985 the

Lombard rate has been at or above the call rate, while the U.S. discount
rate is virtually always below the federal funds rate.

One would expect

Lombard loans to be very low when the rate charged on those loans

exceeds the open-market borrowing rate, and that is indeed the case.
However, Lombard loans have not been zero during the past decade by any
means, presumably because some banks have emergency borrowing needs or
have imperfect access to the call market.

Since the spread between the

call rate and the Lotiard rate is still a measure of the opportunity
cost of using the Lotiard window, we would expect eq. (2.8) to apply

this equation is (so far) unrestricted, allowing both for the Bundesbank
to use the Lombard rate to offset other shocks in the reserves market,
and for autonomous innovations to the Lombard rate, V’ .

‘As our discussant van Hagen pointed out, on a few occasions during our
sample period the Bundesbank imposed additional restrictions on Lombard
lending:
Between September 1979 and March 1980, limits on Lombard
lending equal to 15% of the standard rediscount quota were imposed.
Between February 1981 and May 1902, the Bundesbank granted “special”
Lombard loans at 3% above the regular Lombard rate, with provisions for
recall or ch”anges in the rate at short notice; the regular Lombard
window was closed. We do not account for these periods in our analysis,
which may cause us to understate the tightness of monetary policy during
those episodes. Special Lombard loans have been discontinued since 1982.

Thus the

To see if changes in the instruments

available to the Bundesbank had had any effect, we estimated the model
for the first ten years and last ten years of the sample, as well as for
the whole fifteen-year sample (re-estimating the VAR each time) ,

The

last ten years of the sample (1980:7-1990:6) correspond roughly to the

(1975:1-1985:1) ends at the date that the Lombard rate became a penalty

Again the nonborrowed reserves model is

Similarly, the Lombard rate model is far

from being rejected in the pre-1985 period, before the Lombard rate
became a penalty rate (p = 0.925); after 1985, this model does
relatively less well

(p = 0.423) .

A somewhat anomalous result is that

the Lombard rate nevertheless achieves a better p-value than the call
rate in the last, short sample period, 1985-1990.

Judging by the

estimate of ~d from the Lombard rate model, which is only 0.114 and not
statistically different from zero, and by the earlier finding that the
nonborrowed reserves model does well in the post-1985 period, there
appears to be evidence of reduced smoothing of market interest rates
during the pre-unification

period.

Overall, although the data do not speak very

strongly, the results

suggest a slight preference of the Lombard rate over the call rate as an
indicator of Bundesbank policy for the pre-1990 period.

The Lombard

rate has a (marginally) higher p-value for the whole sample, and for
three of the four subsamples considered.

From an a priori perspective,

the weakest case for the Lombard rate should be in the 1985-1990 period,

‘In early estimations using the entire sample we were able to strongly
reject the call rate in favor of the Lombard rate, a finding that
motivated us to pursue this line further. It appears now that this
rejection was due somehow to the instability of the first-stage V~ in
the early 1970s. However, this result may still be taken as a
cautionary note to those considering the call rate as an indicator for
the period prior to 1975.

21

when this rate became a penalty rate.

Yet as Table 2 shows, the Lombard

rate is not close to being rejected as an indicator for this subperiod,
and its movements after 1985 were very close to those of the call rate.
For these reasons, we use the Lombard rate as the main policy indicator
in the exercises of Section 3.

However, we also check the robustness of

our results to the use of the call rate and a cotiination of the Lotiard
rate and the call rate.
Figure 2 shows the dynatic responses of industrial production and
the CPI to innovations in the call rate and the Lombard rate, the two
non-rejected

indicators.

These impulse responses are calculated from

four-variable VARS including the same set of non-policy variables as
above plus the relevant indicator.

The main point of interest is that,

unlike the call rate, the response of the price level to Lombard rate
innovations does not exhibit the “price puzzle”.

The statistical

uncertainty about this result is large, but we nevertheless

find it

encouraging for the use of the Lombard rate as a policy indicator.

3.

The Bundesbank:

Closet inflation targeter?

We are prepared now to try to answer the question posed by the
introduction,

of whether the Bundesbank is better characterized as an

inflation targeter or as a money targeterm

We first briefly discuss

some historical evidence, then turn to our statistical test.
Although the Bundesbank has publicly emphasized the importance of
money targets in its policy-making

since 1975, it has been often noted

that these money targets are tied to projections of inflation and
potential output growth through the quantity equation relationship

(von

Hagen, 1995; Bernanke and Mishkin, 1992; von Hagen and Neumann, 1993) .
Our attempt to reconstruct that calculation from Bundesbank reports is
shown in Table 3.

The column labelled “money growth target” shows the

22

official ex ante targets (for growth of central bank money prior to
1988, M3 growth thereafter), as set in December prior to the year to
which the target applies.

As in von Hagen (1995), what we have labelled

the “inflation target” is the announced rate of “unavoidable inflation”
for 1975-1985; afteI 1985, the inflation target is always set to 2.o%,
which the Bundesbank has deemed to be the rate consistent with “price
stability”.

Also given are the Bundesbank’s estimates of growth of

“production potential” and their stated adjustment for velocity.

By the

Bundesbank’s procedure the money growth target should be the sum of the
inflation target and forecasted potential output growth, less the
velocity adjustment.

This is usually the case (or nearly so) in Table

3, although note that after 1978 money gzowth targets are generally set
as a range rather than as a point.g
The impression one receives from the table is that, for the most
part, the Bundesbank has made its money growth targets subservient to
its inflation targets.

Note that the inflation targets decline steadily

(except in the oil-shock year, 1980), and are considerably less volatile
than the money growth targets; and that, as mentioned, money growth
targets are usually specified as ranges, while inflation targets are
points

(except in 1981).

Also, on one occasion

(1987) the Bundesbank

changed its targeted money aggregate, an event that occurred when abovetarget money growth coincided with below-target inflation.
The Bundesbank has subjugated its money growth objective to its
inflation objective in another sense, in its willingness to deviate from
money growth targets to offset unexpected inflation.

This point--which

has been emphasized by von Hagen (1995)--is also illustrated in Table 3,
by the columns which show targets, outcomes, and deviations

from targets

9 Part of the’.discrepancy between the actual money growth targets and
the targets implied by the quantity-theory calculation arises because
inflation rates are expressed as annual averages while money growth
rates (after 1978) are measured fourth quarter to fourth quarter.

23

(or from the middle of target ranges) for both money growth and
inflation.

At least through unification in 1990, the record indicates a

clear negative relationship between deviations of money growth from
target and deviations of inflation from target, suggesting a willingness
of the Bundesbank to “lean against the (inflationary) wind”.

(The

regression coefficient of the money growth deviation on the inflation
deviation for 1975-1990 is -0.872, with a t-statistic of 4.0.)

Indeed,

the Bundesbank achieves its target range for money in only a minority of
cases .

However, after 1990 there has been at least a temporary change

in behavior, with inflation and money growth tending to deviate in the
same instead of opposite directions.
Despite these indications that the Bundesbank is “really” an
inflation targeter, such a conclusion would not fit entirely with the
Bundesbank’s own claims.

For example, a recent official publication

(Deutsche Bundesbank, 1995) includes the following corrunentary:
“More recently, the central banks of some countries (e.g. Canada,
New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Finland) have abandoned the
practice of setting an intermediate target and switched to
targeting the final goal direct. However, the transition to such
a one-tier strategy of inflation taxgeting was not effected
because such strategies are inherently superior--say, in terms of
theoretical approach.
It was effected not by choice but rather of
necessity, since (particularly in the wake of radical change in
the financial markets) the traditional monetary relationships had
become unstable, and there was no longer a predictable correlation
between the intermediate target variable and prices. The one-tier
strategy would thus appear to be a “second-best” solution if a
suitable intermediate target is no longer available. ..The
disadvantages of such a multi-indicator approach lie in a very
high degree of complexity, the associated lack of transparency for
the general public and the risk of a certain disorientation of
monetary policy decisions.
For these reasons an intermediate
target strategy is preferable to targeting the final goal direct
as long as monetary policy has at its disposable an intermediate
target variable which basically meets the above-mentioned
requirements. ..“(pp. 67-8)

We take the above statement as asserting the view that targeting
money growth can be superior to targeting the forecast of inflation-notwithstanding

Svensson’s

(1996) argument to the contrary--because

24

money targeting is easier to explain to the public and perhaps because
it limits the scope for poor policy decisions

(“disorientation”) .

this statement accurately reflects German policymakers’

If

views, then

clearly they must sometimes allow policy to respond to deviations of
money growth from the projected path, even if inflation is on target.
In the remainder of this section we attempt to evaluate
statistically whether the Bundesbank should be thought of as an
inflation targeter or not.

We do this by asking the question:

Given

forecasted inflation, do changes in forecasted money growth affect
Bundesbank policy?

And if so--to take the question one step further--is

it because money growth is correlated with other goal variables of the
Bundesbank, or because the Bundesbank considers it intrinsically
desirable to hit its money target?
Although our test is an intuitive one, it may be useful to
motivate it by a simple example.

According to (3.2), the

money stock in turn is affected by stochastic factors and (with a oneperiod lag) by the policy instrument.

We assume for simplicity that the

error terms affecting prices and money are random walks

that our results hold for more general stochastic processes):

facts that the revision in the inflation forecast, EIP2–EOP2,

some algebra

reveals that

(3.7)

That is, the innovation in the policy instrument responds to interim
innovations in the forecasts of inflation and money growth, with a
relative weight that depends on the importance of money deviations in
the central bank’s loss function.

In particular, if the central bank is

a “pure” inflation targeter, and it therefore puts no weight on
deviations of money from target except insofar as money affects
inflation

{a= O),

then changes in the instrument will be related only

to changes in forecasted inflation and not, given forecasted inflation,
to changes in forecasted money growth.

In contrast, if money growth

enters the objective function independently, then the policy’ instrument
will respond to changes in forecasted money growth even if forecasted
inflation is held constant.

More generally, if additional factors

besides inflation and money growth are of concern to the central bank,
changes in the forecasts of

these variables will have marginal

predictive power for the policy instrment,

given forecasts of inflation

and money.
These insights provide the basis for our test of the inflationtargeting propensities of the Bundesbank.1°
monthly time series of twelve-month-ahead

We began by constructing

forecasts for inflation, money

growth, and other variables to be specified in a moment.

In-sample

forecasts were constructed from a six-variable VAR including the three
non-policy variables, the Lotiard rate, money, and the exchange rate.11
The in-sample, twelve-month-ahead

forecasts of inflation obtained by

this method fit closely with the series of Bundesbank inflation targets
as shown in Table 3.
Our main tests of the determinants of German monetary policy are
given in Table 4.
of ntiers

The basic result is illustrated by the first colm

corresponding

to Equation 1, under the heading “Lombard rate”

(ignore the other columns for now).

These results are drawn from a

twelve-lag VA.R including three variables:

the forecast for inflation

over the next twelve months, at each date; the forecast for money growth
(CBM before 1988, M3 afterwards), at each date; and the Lombard rate.
The question we ask is:

Given twelve lags of the inflation forecast and

1° In his cormnent on this paper at the conference, Larry Christian
pointed out another implication of this framework: namely, that
deviations of inflation from target should be unforecastable.
Equivalently, the best statistical forecast of inflation should always
equal the official target. These implications are rejected by the data
at most horizons, but (like the analogous “random-walk” tests of the
permanent-income hypothesis) these rejections do not shed much light on
the quantitative significance of the deviation from inflation targeting.
For this reason we prefer the test described in the text.
llWe compared in-sample forecasts of inflation and other variables based
(1) on an autoregression; (2) on the “base” VA.R, including the three
non-policy variables and the Lombard rate; and (3) on the base VAR
augmented by various combinations of the log of the money stock (CBM
spliced to M3 in 1988) and the log of the DM/dollar exchange rate,
twelve monthly lags being used in all cases. Statistical tests
(including Gqanger-causality and block-erogeneity tests) favo~ed the
inclusion of both the money stock and the exchange rate in the
forecasting equations. In particular, the fact that money contains
significant marginal information about future inflation is interesting,
given the claim that money is targeted for that very reason.

twelve lags of the Lombard rate itself, do lags of the money growth
forecast have additional predictive power for the Lombard rate?lz
Granger sense, Table 4 shows that the answer is yes:

In a

Both inflation

forecasts and money forecasts Grange~-cause the Lombard rate at better
than a 5% level.

Thus there is some evidence that the money forecast

affects Bundesbank policy decisions, even given the inflation forecast.
But how big is this effect?

The second part of Table 4 shows the

percentage of the forecast variance for the Lombard Kate explained at
different horizons by innovations to each of the three variables in the

VAR.

We find that at short horizons the forecast error for the Lombard

rate is dominated by its own shocks, and at longer horizons it is
dominated by shocks to the inflation forecast.

Shocks to the money

growth forecast do not play an important role quantitatively
determining the Lotiard rate at any horizon,

in

This is the basis for our

conclusion that the Bundesbank is better characterized as an inflation
targeter than as a money targeter.
It would be interesting to know whether the Granger-causal
relationship between money growth forecasts and the Lotiard rate arises
because the Bundesbank is interested in money growth per se, or because
money growth forecasts goal variables other than inflation.

and 3 in Table 4 add sequentially the one-year forecasts of industrial

(Exchange-rate depreciation is ordered after, rather than before the
Lotiard rate on the grounds that exchange rates are not a “slow-moving”

statistics. )

We find that

the money growth forecast continues to Granger-cause the Lombard rate at
the 5% level in both cases, suggesting that the Bundesbank pays
attention to money growth for some reason (establishment of credibility,
perhaps) not directly related to its predictive power for ultimate goal
variables,

There is also some evidence, consistent with what others

have found, that the Bundesbank pays attention to ultimate objectives
other than inflation:

Forecasted output Granger-causes

to

The expected rate of

exchange rate depreciation does not Granger-cause the Lombard rate, but
it has some effect on the Lombard rate’s forecast error at longer
horizons.

(This latter result is difficult to interpret; it may arise

from the collinearity of expected exchange rate depreciation
expected inflation. )

and

Our main result survives, however, in that

innovations to inflation forecasts continue to play a large role, and
innovations to money growth forecasts a small role, in the determination
of Lotiard rate forecast errors,
To check that these results do not depend on the use of the
Lombard rate as the policy indicator, we repeated all of these tests
using as the indicator a) the call rate, and b) a “spliced” series based
on the Lombard rate prior to 1985 and the call rate afterwards.13
Granger-causality

The

results using the alternative indicators are shown in

the second and third columns of numbers in the top half of Table 4.

The

results for the call rate seem even stronger than for the Lombard rate:
The inflation forecast always Granger-causes

the call rate at the 5%

level, while the money growth forecast never does.

use the largest VA.R from Table 4 (with the

innovation to the inflation forecast leads to a policy tightening, as
captured by a rise in the Lombard rate.

Forecasted output growth

declines, as would be expected, and the rate of expected depreciation of
the exchange rate rises.15 Most interesting, though, is that the
forecasted rate of money growth falls in an almost mirror image of the
increase in forecasted inflation.

This pattern seems to confirm the

“leaning against the wind” story told by von Hagen (1995) and others.

Conclusion
Our main conclusion has been amply foreshadowed.

In brief,

although the Bundesbank uses money growth as an important informational
variable and operating guide, and despite its protestations

to the

14 We also ran our tests ’using the forecasted deviations of inflation
and money growth from the official targets (and of output and exchange
rates from their Hodrick-Prescott trends) in place of the simple
forecasts.
In doing so, we experimented with different assumptions
about the willingness of the Bundesbank to try to offset previous
overshooting or undershooting of targets. The results were not much
different from those reported in Table 4.
151t is probably dangerous to overinterpret the latter finding, given
the asset-price nature of exchange rates. Possible explanations for an
increased rate of expected depreciation include an overshooting effect
from money tightening, and the information effect of the increased rate
of anticipated inflation,

31

contrary, it seems to be better characterized as an inflation targeter
than as a money targeter.

Following the example set by German monetary

policy should not be construed as ~igid adherence to money growth
targets, a practice which the Bundesbank itself has not followed.

justified, of course, but some less so.

In this

appendix we use simple examples to address two questions that have been
raised about the central concept of “shocks” to monetary policy, as
follows:
(1) What is the source of monetary policy shocks?
(2) Why draw a distinction between innovations to the money supply
and innovations to monetary policy?

(1

Some critics have questioned the concept of “shocks” to

monetary policy.

They point out that the Fed and the Bundesbank

certainly do not randomize their policy actions explicitly, and that any
errors made in the implementation of policies are likely to be quickly
reve~sed.

How then could shocks to policy be laxge enough to matter?

In general, all that is necessary for what we call a ?olicy shock
to occur is that the policy decision be influenced by some factor
(personalities, beliefs, political considerations, problems of
measurement or interpretation)

that is imperfectly correlated with the

current state of the economy.

In the following example we illustrate

that valid

(in the sense required by our paper) policy shocks can be

generated from two realistic sources:

(a) imperfect information on the

part of the central bank about the current economy, and (b) changes in
the relative weights put by the central bank on moderating
in output and inflation.

fluctuations

In particular, neither explicit randomization

33

nor persistent implementation errors are needed to generate meaningful
policy shocks.
Consider the following simple economy:

The central bank’s policy reaction function is described by (A.2):

The

change in the money supply between periods t-1 and t is inversely
related to the supply shock observed by the central bank at t.

further justification of this assumption below; later we also relax the
assumption that the money supply is the operating instrument) .

that prices prevailing in period t are set at

the end of t-1, using only information available in t-1.

If we assume

that prices are set so that the expected value of output equals its

level (which we normalize to zero), than it is

straightforward

to deduce that prices will equal the expected money

stock, which in turn equals the lagged money stock (eq. (A.4)) .

Thus this example does not literally

conform to the framework used in this paper, which bases identification
on the assumption that policy shocks affect macro variables only with a
one-period delay.

However, the assumption of simultaneity

is for

simplicity only and could be eliminated by a more complicated
specification;

it does not affect the focus of this example, which is

the interpretation

of policy shocks.

Now we suppose that the econometrician estimates the central
bank’s reaction function (A.7), using her ex post knowledge of the
supply shock in period t.

for using revised data, that was not known contemporaneously
when estimating the reaction function. )

In this case the policy shock

Given this policy shock, the econometrician

can correctly estimate the

effects of monetary policy shocks on the economy, i.e., from (A.5) and

the assumption that random

Note that in this example prices are not pre-

Again, these values are obtainable by simpler

The example illustrates that, as long as the econometrician

knows

or can estimate the central bank’s operating procedure, it is irrelevant
whether that procedure is interest-rate targeting or money-targeting;

in

either case, the true impact effect of an innovation to money can be
obtained.

However, it is also true that if the wrong operating

procedure is asswed,

the correct impact effect will not be obtained.

Suppose for example that interest rates are being targeted, but the
econometrician measures the impact effect of a money shock by the
regression of the output residual on the money residual.

As can be

calculated from (A.21), this regression coefficient bears no particular
relation to the desired impact effect; instead, it is a mongrel
coefficient that depends on the impact of each type of shock on money
and output, and the relative variances of those shocks.

inflation target has been 2.0%, the rate judged consistent with “price
stability”. Money growth targets are calculated (using the quantity
equation) as the inflation target plus the potential growth of
production minus an adjustment for expected changes in velocity.

The 1991 target range for money growth was lowered to 3-5% in July.

from three-, fou~-, and five-variable VARS
Notes: This table is derived
including combinations of the policy indicator (the Lombard rate, the
call rate, or a splice of the two rates); and twelve-month-ahead VARbased forecasts of the growth rates of the CPI, industrial production,
the money stock (CBM through 1987, M3 afterwards), and the DM/$ exchange
rate. The top half of the table gives p-values for tests of whether
each variable Granger-causes the alternative policy indicators, with low
values indicating a significant relationship.
The bottom half of the
table shows decompositions of forecast variance at various horizons for
the Lombard rate only.
