ABSTRACT

This paper considers why non-monetary

means of exchange,

such as barter and the

reciprocation of favors, are chosen by firms despite the usual benefits of monetary transactions. We
consider

the chosen

means of exchange

when both monetary and non-monetary

exchange

mechanisms are available. We illustrate three potential reasons for the emergence of non-monetary
trade. First, a willingness to barter may reveal information that cannot be revealed solely through
monetary trade.

Second, non-monetary trade may constrain the ability of agents to engage in

inefficient rent-seeking activities.

Finally, non-monetary trade improves the ability of agents to

impose trade sanctions on those who act dishonestly. We consider a number of applications of each
of these ideas.

the assets are lost forever. Because we have assumed that the investments are productively neutral,
H appears only on the left-hand side of the incentive compatibility condition, improving the ability
of the partners to trade efficiently. Prom the above analysis, the value of such investments is clear.
Importantly, conditions (2) and (3) above regarding the specificity of the investments are necessary for cooperation to be enhanced.

If, for example, assets were individually salvageable, the

deviator can take the other’s hostage, which will make deviation more desirable. Similarly, if the
assets are tradeable between the parties, then H disappears entirely from the incentive compatibility condi tion as the agents will swap their hostages at no cost following a deviation. This need for
non-salvageability and non-tradeability of hostages implies that the hostages must, be non-monetary.
