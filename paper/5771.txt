THE EXCHANGE VALUE OF THE
RENMINBI AND CHINA’S BALANCE
OF TRADE: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY

ABSTRACT

This paper aims at assessing the relationship between the exchange value of the Chinese
Renminbi

(RMG) and China’s trade balance by means of some recent econometric

techniques

designed to evaluate the existence and the direction of causality. We find strong evidence suggesting
that changes in the trade balance and each of its components Granger-cause changes in the exchange
rate but no evidence indicating a causal link running from the exchange rate to the trade balance.
Our results seem to be rather supportive of the accommodative

role of the exchange rate proposed

by the modem theory of the trade balance determination and not supportive of the existence of a Jcurve in China’s trade balance.

Our finding of a bidirectional causal relationship between the real

exchange rate and the price variables confirms the presence of a vicious circle hypothesis following
currency devaluation.

This has important implications for the discussions of impacts of the RMB

devaluation on China’s trade balance.

In comparison with the transitional economies of Eastern Europe, China’s experience
of economic reforms is to some extent unique in that its economy, instead of sharp decline,
grew rapidly in the context of the reform process that transformed the economy from a rigid

other hand, the portion

of foreign

has been

reduced while more subject to the market forces. By 1991 exports and imports

subject to mandatory

planning had fallen to 30 percent and 20 percent of their respective

totals, while the guidance plan accounted for 15 percent and 20 percent, respectively.

As the

role of trade plan has declined, direct control over exports and imports has continued through
a licensing system which covered 55 percent of exports and 40 percent of imports in 1991
(Bell et al., 1993).
In line with its foreign trade system reform, China has repeatedly devalued its currency

2. Foreign Exchange Policy: An Overview

The pre-reform

exchange

system of China was characterized

by strict control of

foreign exchange transactions and rigidity of the RMB exchange rate. It could neither respond
flexibly to the change of price parities between China and the rest of the world, nor make
prompt adjustment

according to the changing supply and demand of foreign exchange. At

most, it acted as an accounting tool, and failed to adjust the trade volume. This is actually
associated with the state monopoly of China’s foreign trade regime under which all import
and export contracts with foreign firms could only be signed by a few authorized import and
export corporations.2
trade adjustments

Conspicuously,

traders under this regime had no incentives

to make

in response to prices changes and exchange rate policy.

During the early stages of the reform, various arrangements

were tested for sharing

foreign exchange with the objective of improving incentives for exports. A retention system
emerged,

under which exporters surrender their actual foreign exchange earnings and are

issued retention quotas by the SAEC equivalent to a portion of such earnings. This system
has evolved with a complex set of regulations on allocating foreign exchange according to
industry and location before a uniform retention rate for enterprises was set throughout

the

country by 199 1.S Other measures to promoting exports include various export subsidies4 and

2 The number of the specialized foreign trade corporation had risen and fallen over the
entire pre-reform period, partly due to the structural changes of the administrative ministries.
By 1978, on] y 10 national import and export corporations under China’s trade ministry had
been solely authorized to sign import and export contracts with foreign firms.
s The new rules announced in February 1991 allows exporters (other than foreign-funded
enterprises) to receive retention quotas for 80 percent of their foreign exchange earnings,
while 100 percent for mechanical and electronical products. These retention quotas are
distributed to foreign trade corporation (60 percentage points), the supplying enterprises (10
percentage points), and the local government (10 percentage points). The practice of the
foreign exchange retention system has been terminated in 1992 due to considerable distortions

of

system or agency system into various levels of foreign trade institutions in

the mid- 1980s further increased the freedom of these economic agents in response to the
market forces in managing international trade. The foreign trade system reform has no doubt
contributed to the rapid expansion of China’s foreign trade. In 1978 the total trade amounted
only to US$20.6 billion and it rose to US$ 165.5 billion in 1992, an increase of over eight
times. Exports grew at a similar pace, rising from US$9.75 billion in 1978 to US$84.9 billion
in 1992 (Zhang, 1995).

introduced

a dual exchange

rate system:

one is for non-trade

at a rate of about RMB 1.5 yuan per dollar; and another rate is more favorable

for the internal settlement of trade transactions. The dual rate system was abandoned in 1985
but re-emerged

in 1986 with the establishment

of the foreign exchange adjustment

(FEACS) or swap centres at which approved enterprises

were permitted

centres

to buy and sell

retention quotas. After freer trading was permitted in 1988, the premium on exchange rates
in the swap centres rose to about 80 percent, reflecting an increased number of participants
at the same time as aggregate demand was surging. The swap markets had come to dominate
China’s foreign-currency

transactions,

representing

an estimated 80-85 percent of all such

activity at over 100 swap locations. The exchange rate at the swap centres had been set by
a combination of market forces and government intervention, although such interventions were

rate, and thereafter the differential between the two rates narrowed to about 8 percent before

20, bring the value to RMB 5.3066 per dollar. Several additional

were

By April 1993, the real effective exchange rate of the official exchange rate had depreciated
33 percent more than in 1986 and 70 percent more than in 1980 (Bell et al. 1993). One key
reason for those continuous currency devaluation is to reduce the price distortion and promote
exports. This seems to be true in some sense that there did exist certain relationship between
exchange

rate and trade flows in the 1980s.s One must note however that the Chinese

authority has been very cautiously to devalue its highly over-valued currency over time. It is
mainly due to the consideration

of the inflationary effect of currency devaluation.

s Wang (1993) find that there is a positive relationship between real exchange rate and
exports. Using quarterly data for 1980:1 to 1989: IV, Brada, Kutan and Zhou (1993) find that,
in both the short-run and the long-run, devaluation of the RMB serves to improve the balance
of trade.

One notable step in the foreign exchange reform was the unification

of China’s two

main currency rates (the swap rates and the official rates) and allowed the exchange rate
limited room to freely float from the beginning of 1994. This led to a substantial devaluation
of the currency to RMB 8.7 yuan to the dollar, a rate quite close to that in the black market.
Since then the exchange

value of the RMB has been remained stable, while appreciated

against the US dollar in the last two years by about 5 percent in nominal terms and 22
percent in real terms. As a matter of fact, China’s exports during this period grew rapidly by
24 percent in 1994 and 23 percent in 1995 with a trade surplus of US$5. 1 billion and
US$ 16.7 billion, respectively.

This raised a question over the relationship

between the real

exchange rate and the balance of trade in the transitional economy of China. However, it has
no doubt that the exchange rate in the Chinese economy plays a major role in the level and
composition

of exports and imports (World Bank, 1990).

Since March 1996, restrictions on the foreign exchange transfers of foreign invested
firms in 4 cities (Shanghai, Shenzhen, Dalian and Jiangsu) have been removed such that they
could exchange funds freely at selected banks without approval from the SAEC. This program
is expected to be extended to the rest of the country and also granted to the local firms soon.

3. The Theoretical

Framework

and Methodology

There are mainly two competing theories put forward to explain the relation between

7

exchange rate and trade balance. The first one is based on “the J-curve hypothesis” according
to which, following

a devaluation

of the nominal exchange rate, the nominal trade balance

initially deteriorates

before it improves. The empirical results of some recent studies do not

provide a clear-cut answer regarding the validity of the J-curve hypothesis.

Rosenswieg

and

Koch (1988), Mead (1988), and Mahdavi and Sohrabian (1993) find evidence of a “delayed
J-curve pattern” consisting of a number of overlapping

standard J-curve. Some others even

find no statistically reliable evidence of a stable J-curve (Rose and Yellen, 1989). The central
points of these studies seem to suggest a slow and partial pass-through

of changes in the

exchange rate into import prices and even a relatively quicker and larger pass-through

into

export prices.
The second theory to explaining the relation between exchange rate and trade balance
is the so-called “modern theory” of trade balance determination

(Greenwood,

1984; Razin,

1984; McKinnon and Ohno, 1986). This theory gives great weight to intertemporal shocks and
exogenous supply shocks in explaining trade imbalances. The empirical consequences

of this

modern theory are twofold: first, because exogenous factors affect the movements of both the
real exchange rate and the trade balance, the change in one variable can only partially explain
the change in the other variable; second, the relationship between the two variables may be
bidirectional

(Hill, 1990). However, empirical studies of the nexus between real exchange rate

and the trade balance have usually assumed a unidirectional causal relationship in the opposite
direction (Himarios,

1989).

The theoretical

discussion

of the J-curve hypothesis

can be better described by the

following equation:b

export and import contracts

respectively.

are mainly written in local currency and dollars,

A devaluation of the exchange rate will raise the imports value of the economy

in local currency due to the rising of import price, while the export value will remain
unchanged.

In the short run, the trade balance will be deteriorated.

Over a longer period of

time, the export and import volumes will react to the changes in the relative prices following
the devaluation. Downward adjustment in import volume is expected while export volume will
rise as the export prices expressed in dollars become more competitive. This will result in an
improvement

in the trade balance. Thus, a devaluation

of the exchange rate will affect the

trade balance through both price effect and volume effect, the former effect of the devaluation
leads to the deterioration

of the trade balance, i.e. the declining segment of the J-curve, while

the latter effect contributes to the improvement

of trade balance, i.e. the rising part of the J-

curve. In this study, we attempt to examine the dynamic relationship

between the exchange

rate and the trade balance as well as the nature and direction of causal relationship

between

the exchange rate and the price and quantity components of the trade balance. The existence
of certain dynamic links between these variables may provide explanatory

4. Data and Empirical

results

4.1. Data

The methodology
relationships

described in the last section is employed to investigate the dynamic

between the exchange value of Chinese RMB and China’s trade balance as well

as its price and quantity components.

The period under investigation

ranges from January

1991 to February 1996, a more flexible, relatively floating rate era. This period witnessed the
rapid expansion of China’s foreign trade and FDI flows. Besides data availability,

one key

reason to limit our tests to this period is that this period covers the most notable events in the
process of China’s foreign trade system reform. These include for instance the abolition of
export subsidies

in 1991 and of the foreign exchange retention

system in 1992, and the

unification of its dual foreign exchange system in 1994. Following the implementation

of deep

structural reforms, it is more evidenced that China has begun to conduct its foreign trade in
accordance with its comparative
use of administrative

advantage and the international

conventions

rather than the

measures. Therefore, it will be more interesting to evaluate if the new

13

foreign trade regime can make the balance of trade response to the exchange rate, in other
words, if the devaluation

of the Chinese currency improves the balance of trade. The major

sources of data are IMF: International Financial Statistics, the Statistical Yearbook of China,
the Monthly Statistics of China, and Hong Kong Monthly Digest of Statistics. The variables
involved in the analysis are measured as follows:

BOTN: nominal trade balance defined as the difference between the nominal values
of exports and imports.
BOTR:

real trade balance defined as the nominal trade balance deflatored

by the

China’s consumer price index.
EXCHN: nominal exchange value of the RMB as measured by the trade-weighted
exchange rate index of the RMB against the four countries (Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore,
and the United States) as they are the largest trading partners of China, taking a share of 60
percent in China’s total foreign trade. Their average shares in China’s foreign trade from 1991
to 1996 were used as weights in calculating the index.
EXCHR: real exchange rate defined as the nominal rate of RMB multiplied

by the

relative price ratio of the world price level over that of China. The consumer price indexes
are used. The index of the world price level is taken to be the trade-weighted

consumer price

index of the four countries.
PX and PM: China’s export and import prices, respectively,

as measured by export

(import) -weighted unit value of import and export indexes of China’s four largest trading
partners.

4,2. Testing for Unit Roots

The results of the ADF test for the eight variables are presented in Table 1. They
support the presence of a unit root in all of the series, while stationarity is achieved after first
differencing

of the levels for trade balance and the volume of exports and imports, and after

the second differencing

of the levels of exchange rate and export and import prices. These

results are particularly important in order to avoid spurious regression problems as observed
in many earlier studies of the exchange rate and trade balance nexus. They are also important
to the understanding

of those controversial

issues regarding the RMB devaluation

and its

impact on China’s trade balance, as studies based on the conventional method without taking
unit root into account will generate divergent, even opposite conclusion as those taking some
transformation

(e.g., first-differencing)

before stationarity is achieved.7

of the variables have been used. The ADF tests are applied for detecting a unit root in the
residuals of the relevant cointegrating

regressions,

which involves regressing the following

equations:

is the residual from the cointegrating regression. These unit root tests show that while

the residuals from the regressions

of the levels of the variables have unit roots, those from

the first difference regressions do not (Table 2 and 3). These results are consistent with the
inference that while levels of exchange rate and trade balance as well as its components

are

not cointegrated, changes of these variables are cointegrated, implying the presence of a longrun stable linear relationship

between exchange rate and trade balance and its components.

Table 4 displays the results of the Johansen procedure used to test for cointegration.
With only a few exceptions, the Johansen procedure yields a quite similar result as the EngleGranger method, implying the presence of a long-run stable linear relationship

between the

(real) exchange rate and the (real) trade balance and its quantity components. The results also
suggest a weak long run relationship
but no long-run relationship

between the (real) exchange rate and the export price

between the exchange rate and the import price variable. Our

findings contrast with those obtained in similar studies on OECD countries such as Rose and
Yellen (1989), Mahdavi and Sohrabian (1993), and even Gruen and Wilkinson

(1994). The

latter find weak evidence of a stable relationship between the Australian real exchange rate
16

and the terms of trade in 1969-1990.

4.4. Testing for Causality

As the results of the Johansen test statistics do not seem to suggest that the real
exchange rate of the RMB is cointegrated

with the import price variable and the nominal

exchange rate is cointegrated with import and export prices variables, the dynamic equations

tests may be specified in the first-difference

form according to the standard methodology

that the J-curve effect did not appear in China’s trade balance following a devaluation in the
short run. A tentative explanation for this result may lie in the weak effects of exchange rate
on the quantity side of the trade balance. There is no evidence of the presence of Grangercausality from exchange rate to the volumes of imports and exports. Their causal relationship

Our findings of a bidirectional

exchange rate and the prices variables confirm the presence of a vicious circle hypothesis,
implying that the devaluation of the Chinese currency sets in motion inflationary effect on the
prices which in turn cause further devaluation of the currency. This partially explains why in
the past the Chinese government has been very cautiously to devalue its highly over-valued
currency. Our results also suggest that the changes in exchange rate are much a consequence
as a cause of trade movements.

Changes in the exchange rate of the RMB alone seem less

likely improve the trade balance. Under the current economic system, an RMB devaluation
can improve China’s trade balance only if it is accompanied by other policies.
