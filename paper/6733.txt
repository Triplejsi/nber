1. Introduction
For decades economists have argued that there are substantial benefits to holding an
internationally-diversified investment portfolio. Nearly thirty years ago, Grubel (1968) and Levy and
Sarnat (1970) demonstrated that, given the relatively low correlation of equity returns across markets,
investors could increase the return on their portfolios while minimizing risk by holding a combination of
domestic and foreign market indices. The potential benefits from investing abroad have become even more
compelling over time as the pool of international investment opportunities has expanded to include
emerging markets and newly privatized firms in Asia, Europe and Latin America.
Despite the benefits of global diversification, evidence on home bias suggests that investors in
industrialized countries have been reluctant to hold more than a fraction of their wealth in foreign assets
(French and Poterba (1991) and Tesar and Werner (1995)). While investors have increased their holdings
of foreign stocks in recent years, the fraction of the portfolio invested abroad remains far less than the share
implied by standard models of optimal portfolio choice. At the end of 1996, the share of national equity
portfolios invested in foreign stocks was 11.2 percent in Canada, 5.3 percent in Japan, 18.2 percent in
Germany, 22.5 percent in the United Kingdom and 10 percent in the United States (Tesar and Werner
(1997)). The extent of home bias in bond portfolios tends to be even larger than in equity portfolios.1
One possible explanation for home bias is that investors obtain indirect international diversification
benefits by investing in multinational firms. Previous studies have generally concluded that multinational
firms do not provide diversification benefits. Jacquillat and Solnik (1978) regressed the returns of
multinationals from nine countries on the set of market indices and found that multinational returns tended
to covary most with the firm's home market. Senchack and Beedles (1980) contrasted the risk, returns and
betas of portfolios of multinationals with portfolios of domestic and international stocks and found that
multinationals did not deliver diversification benefits. These studies presume that the appropriate domestic
benchmark is the market portfolio. While in theory the value-weighted index of domestic stocks should
reflect the full benefits of investing in the home market, the construction of a fully efficient market index is
problematic (Roll (1977)).
In this paper, we employ mean-variance spanning techniques to test whether the addition of
multinationals and international equities to a broad-based portfolio of domestic stocks significantly shifts
the portfolio frontier. This method imposes no restriction on the asset weights in either the domestic

1

portfolio or the portfolio of domestic and international equities. The extent to which the set of domestic
assets spans the set of international investment opportunities could fall along a continuum of possibilities.
At one extreme, maximum diversification benefits could be achieved without holding any international
assets if the set of domestic assets completely spans the set of international assets. At the other extreme, if
the set of domestic assets spans an insignificant portion of the set of international assets, then international
diversification is required to obtain maximum diversification benefits. The central question considered in
this paper is the extent to which a portfolio of domestic equities can provide the potential benefits of
holding international equity.
We make three contributions to the literature on the benefits of global diversification. First, we test
whether the addition of multinationals (headquartered in the investor's country of origin) to the set of
domestic equities provides diversification benefits, controlling for the effects of industry classification and
firm size. We examine this hypothesis from the perspective of investors in Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States over the 1984-1992 time period. We split the time period
into two subsamples to control for possible effects due to the October 1987 market crash. In general we
find that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the addition of multinational corporations to the
benchmark set of domestic assets fails to shift the portfolio frontier, confirming the findings of the
literature. There is weak evidence that U.S. multinationals may have provided diversification benefits in the
full sample and the post-1987 subsample. Thus, some home bias due to indirect diversification through
multinationals could possibly be rationalized for the United States.
Our second contribution is to examine whether the addition of international stock market indices
shifts the portfolio frontier that is comprised of both domestic and multinational equities. In contrast to the
findings for multinationals, we find that in most countries and in most time periods the addition of an
international market index to the set of domestic stocks -- inclusive of multinationals -- significantly shifts
the portfolio frontier. While this result may not come as a surprise to those who believe in the benefits of
diversification, our findings contradict the notion that investors from industrialized countries must turn to
emerging markets to capture substantial gains from investing internationally (De Santis (1993)).
Our third contribution is to quantify which markets have, ex post, provided the largest marginal
diversification benefits from the perspective of investors in each of the seven countries in our sample. While
the mean-variance tests provide information about the statistical significance of the shift in the portfolio

1

The exception is the United Kingdom with foreign bond holdings at 37.5 percent of the portfolio in 1995. The
allocation of bonds to "foreign" and "domestic" categories is particularly problematic for the United Kingdom due
to the location of the eurobond market in London.

frontier as assets are added to the benchmark set, the tests do not provide information about magnitude of
the shift in an economic sense. To give some economic content to the magnitude of the shift in the
efficiency frontier, we calculate the percentage change in consumption required to make the investor
indifferent between holding the utility-maximizing portfolio based on the benchmark set of domestic assets
and the utility-maximizing portfolio based of the set of domestic and international equities. We find that in
some cases there are sizable utility gains from adding foreign markets to the set of domestic assets, though
which market provides the largest benefits changes depending on the investor’s country of residence. We
also find that capturing the largest gains from diversification often involves holding a short position in some
available assets and a long position in the other assets. Finally, we find that the utility gains from
international diversification for U.S. investors are surprisingly small, again helping to rationalize home bias
in U.S. investment portfolios.
Section 2 discusses the generalized method of moments mean-variance spanning tests. The utility
metric used to quantify the economic benefits of diversification is presented in Section 3. Section 4
discusses our data set. Our results on the diversification benefits of multinational firms is presented in
Section 5 and the results on the marginal benefits of adding country indices are presented in Section 6.
Section 7 concludes.
2. Generalized Method of Moments Mean-Variance Spanning Test
Throughout, we will refer to the set of domestic equities as the “benchmark" assets and the set of
expanded investment opportunities as the “extended-set" of assets. We perform mean-variance spanning
tests to determine if the portfolio frontier of the combination of the benchmark and extended-set assets is
statistically different from the portfolio frontier of the benchmark assets. In particular, the test asks whether
the inclusion of assets in the extended-set into the full set of assets restricts the set of discount factors that
"price" the benchmark assets alone (Hansen and Jagannathan (1991)). The advantage of the spanning test is
that it does not require specification of a risk-free rate of return. The disadvantage, however, is that
rejection of the null hypothesis that the portfolio frontiers are equivalent does not imply that the marginal
diversification benefits are economically significant. We will address this problem in Section 3 by
providing a utility measure of the benefits of an outward shift of the portfolio frontier.
We follow the methodology described in De Santis (1993) and Bekaert and Urias (1996) to test for
mean-variance spanning. Assuming frictionless markets, a common restriction on asset pricing models is
(2.1)
E[R t +1m t +1 ] = ι

3

where Rt+1 is a n-dimensional vector of gross asset returns, mt+1 is a random variable and ι is a vector of
ones of dimension n x 1.2 Explicit assumptions regarding the parameterization of mt+1 gives equation (2.1)
an economic interpretation. For example, specifying the random variable mt+1 as a linear function of the
return on the market portfolio yields the Capital Asset Pricing Model. Alternatively, if mt+1 is specified as
the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution, the consumption CAPM is obtained.
Following De Santis and Bekaert-Urias, let mt+1 be a candidate discount factor for Rt+1 and assume
mt+1 is a linear projection onto Rt+1 such that
m t +1 = c + [R t +1 − E(R t +1 )]′ β + ε t +1
(2.2)
where c is a constant, εt+1 is the error term of the regression and is uncorrelated with Rt+1 by assumption. In
general, β cannot be estimated because mt+1 is unobserved. Nevertheless, if mt+1 is required to price Rt+1,
then substitution of equation (2.2) into equation (2.1) yields the unconditional asset pricing restriction.

Partition Rt+1 such that R t +1 ≡ R ′B, t +1 R ′E, t +1 and partition β such that β ≡ [β′B β′E ] . The dimensions

of RB and RE are (nB x 1) and (nE x 1), respectively. The null hypothesis that Rt+1 is priced by the subset of
nB assets in RB,t+1 implies that RE,t-1 is redundant for asset pricing. Therefore, under the null hypothesis, the
coefficients in βE are equal to zero and the unconditional asset pricing restriction may be rewritten as:

(2.4)
m t +1 = c + R B, t +1 − E(R B, t +1 ) β B + ε t +1

[

Conditional on a given value of c and that RB,t+1 is a subset of Rt+1, the restriction in equation (2.4) implies
that the portfolio frontier constructed from the benchmark assets is tangent to the portfolio frontier
constructed from the benchmark assets and extended-set assets at the point corresponding to the highest
Sharpe ratio.
The two-fund separation theorem states that any frontier portfolio can be obtained as a linear
combination of any two distinct frontier portfolios. Therefore, if the portfolio frontiers implied by Rt+1 and

( )

RB,t+1 are tangent at two distinct points, then the two frontiers must coincide at all points. Let h T βB

frontiers coincide at all points (i.e. βE = 0 ). Under the null hypothesis, the generalized method of moments
(GMM) test of over-identifying restrictions has a chi-square distribution with 2nE degrees of freedom. The
order of the Newey-West correction used in the GMM algorithm is equal to 4(T / 100 ) 9 (Newey and West

The alternative hypothesis is that βE ≠ 0 . Rejection of the null hypothesis implies that the variation in the
(2.7)

returns of the benchmark assets does not explain the variation of the returns of the benchmark and
extended-set assets. Failure to reject the null hypothesis provides evidence that the benchmark set of assets
spans the risk-return opportunities offered by the extended set of assets.
3. Measuring the Utility Gains from International Diversification
Rejection of the null hypothesis that the benchmark portfolio of domestic assets spans the
extended-set portfolio does not provide information about the magnitude of the shift in the efficiency
frontier, nor does it provide insight into whether the shift is economically significant. To give the shift in the
portfolio frontier an economic interpretation, we calculate the gains in lifetime utility associated with
expanding the portfolio to include the extended set of assets (Cole and Obstfeld (1991), Lewis (1996)). The
utility gain is measured as the percentage reduction in permanent consumption that makes an individual
indifferent between the optimal portfolio when the investor can hold assets from the benchmark and the
extended-set and the optimal portfolio when the investor is restricted to holding assets from the benchmark
set only.5
Let Ct denote permanent consumption at time t of an individual holding the optimal portfolio of
benchmark assets and let Ct* denote the permanent consumption at time t of an individual holding the
optimal portfolio of benchmark and extended-set assets. The utility gain, δ, is given by the relationship
(3.1)
U 0 (C0 ) = U 0  C*0 (1 − δ) .



See DeSantis (1993), Bekaert and Urias (1996) and Campbell, Lo and MacKinlay (1997).
The utility-gain metric has two shortcomings. First, the spanning test presented in Section 3 is the test of the
hypothesis that the asset-pricing kernel is the same for the two sets of assets. If the asset-pricing kernel is not valid
across the two sets of assets, then the utility-gain metric, which is a function of the mean and variance of the
portfolios, is also not valid. Second, we do not consider the variance of the utility-gain metric. Despite these
shortcomings, this metric provides an economically intuitive measure of the distance between portfolio frontiers.

Following Lewis (1996), we use the Epstein-Zin-Weil utility function specification which allows
the risk-aversion parameter, γ, to differ from the inverse of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution
parameter, θ.

where Wt is equal to the individual’s wealth at time t and is assumed to be exogenous.
Figure 1 illustrates the utility gain from adding the extended set of assets to the portfolio of
benchmark assets. Without the extended set of assets the investor maximizes utility subject to the portfolio
frontier of benchmark assets. The optimal portfolio is obtained at the tangency labeled TB. If the set of
available assets is expanded to include both the benchmark and extended-set assets, the investor increases
utility by choosing the optimal portfolio at TBE. The utility gain is measured as the percentage reduction in
permanent consumption that makes an individual indifferent between the optimal portfolio at TBE and the
optimal portfolio at TB, as given in equation (3.1).
The mean and variance of the optimal portfolios at TB and TBE are obtained by equating the
marginal rate of substitution and the marginal rate of transformation. The marginal rate of substitution is
obtained by taking the total differential of the utility function.

We consider the utility gain from diversification for two values of the risk-aversion parameter (γ = 2 and γ
= 5) and an elasticity of intertemporal substitution parameter of two (θ = 2).6 There is little consensus in
the literature about the "true" magnitudes of risk aversion and intertemporal substitution. Our measures are
intended as being suggestive of the possible gains from diversification and the parameter values are chosen
so that our measures can be compared to estimates in other studies.
4. Data Description
We consider the benefits of diversification – through the addition of multinationals or the addition
of foreign market indices – from the perspective of investors from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
the United Kingdom and the United States. For each country in the sample, firm-level data is used to
construct portfolios by industry classification, firm size and domestic/multinational status. The number of
domestic portfolios ranges from 14 for Italy to 21 for the United States. All of the data is extracted from
Datastream, a proprietary database. In instances where Datastream is not the primary source of the data,
the primary source is cited. With the exception of Japan, the sample of equities includes firms that are
currently traded or were previously traded.7 International equities that are cross-listed on the domestic
market are eliminated from the sample of domestic firms. The time series are sampled weekly and the data
sample spans the time period from January 4, 1984 to December 30, 1992. The sample is divided into two
subsamples of equal size, January 1984 to June 1988 and July 1988 to December 1992.
4.1 Domestic Portfolios
Within each country, equities are classified according to industry, firm size and domestic/
multinational status. The four industry classifications are consumer goods and services, energy and
utilities, finance and real estate, and industrials. A firm’s size is determined based on its relative market
capitalization within its industry. The three classifications are small, medium and large. In addition, each

6

Lewis (1996) discusses the relationship between the risk-aversion parameter and the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution parameter. She reports findings for a broader set of parameter values for an investor who holds a
portfolio of market indices.
7
Our sampling of Japanese companies from the Datastream database yielded no delisted or bankrupt firms and no
firms were allocated to the "other" industry classification (see Appendix A). The possibility that there were
delistings and bankruptcies in Japan that are not covered by Datastream would cause our results to overstate the
benefits of holding Japanese stocks.

8

equity is classified as a domestic or a multinational equity. Therefore, each country’s portfolio includes a
maximum of twenty-four categories: half of the categories are domestic equities and half of the categories
are multinational equities. A brief overview of the data-set construction is provided in this section. Details
of the equity classification methodology and construction methodology of the time series of portfolio
returns are explained fully in Appendix A. A listing of the multinational firms in each country is provided
in Appendix B
A summary by country of the category characteristics is presented in Tables 1.1 through 1.7. The
first column of each of the tables shows the number of firms per category. For example, there are 787
small, domestic, consumer-goods-and-services firms in Canada covered by the Datastream database.
Notice that no country has firms in all of the categories. The United States has the most non-empty
categories with 21. For each category, a value-weighted portfolio is constructed by drawing a random
sample from the set of available firms within each category. The maximum size of the random sample is
30.8 Column two reports the number of firms in the sample portfolio. For example, the sample portfolio for
the small, domestic, consumer-goods-and-services category in Canada contains 30 firms. The weights
within the sample portfolio change over time as the market capitalization of the component firms changes.
This ensures that the sample portfolio for each category is value weighted over the full time series of
returns.
A summary of the sample mean returns, the sample standard deviations of returns, and the mean
return per unit risk for each category over the full sample (January 4, 1984 to December 30, 1992) is
reported in columns three through five of Tables 1.1 through 1.7. Tables 2.1 through 2.7 report the
summary statistics for the two subsamples. The return series for each category incorporates the price
appreciation of its component parts and the disbursement of dividends.9
4.2 International Indices
In a subset of testing scenarios, the extended-set portfolio contains international market indices
from the countries other than the benchmark country. The Datastream total-return index for each sample
country is used to construct a time series of weekly returns for each index. The total-return index is a
value-weighted index that includes dividend reinvestment. Dividend disbursements are incorporated into the
index return through the most recent dividend yield on the component security.

8

Ideally, one should create portfolios based on the entire set of firms within each country-industry-size class.
Unfortunately, Datastream does not provide clear documentation of the status of many international firms. We
therefore drew a random sample from each country-industry-size class and used alternative sources to verify the
status of each firm in our random sample.
9
Datastream incorporates the dividend payment by multiplying the return due to price appreciation by the most
recent dividend yield.

9

The sample means and standard deviations of the return series for each country-specific index are
reported in Tables 3.1 and 3.2. The summary statistics are presented for the full nine-year sample and the
two subsamples. Table 3.1 reports the summary statistics in the local currency and Table 3.2 reports the
returns in US dollars. Notice that the mean return decreases from the first subsample to the second sample
for all countries. The largest decreases are obtained for the Japanese and Italian indices. The Japanese
mean weekly return decreases more than 69 basis points, from 0.525 percent per week to -0.168 percent
per week.10 The large decrease in the mean return on the Japanese index reflects the large decrease in the
market capitalization of the Japanese equity market during the second subsample. The mean weekly return
on the Italian index decreases nearly 49 basis points, from 0.546 percent per week to 0.057 percent per
week.
The volatility of the return on each index, as measured by the standard deviation of the weekly
return, decreases from the first subsample to the second subsample for every country-specific index except
Japan. The standard deviation of the weekly return on the Japanese index increases from 2.56 percent per
week to 2.90 percent, an increase of approximately thirteen percent. The increased volatility of the
Japanese index is not surprising given the large decrease in the market capitalization of the Japanese equity
market. For the six indices whose standard deviations decrease, the average decrease is twenty-two percent
of the standard deviation. The standard deviation of the Canadian index exhibits the largest decrease of
32.8 percent, from 2.16 percent per week to 1.45 percent per week. The Italian index exhibits the smallest
decrease of fifteen percent, from 2.68 percent per week to 2.28 percent.
The correlation structure of the returns on the international indices is presented in Table 4 for the
full nine-year sample and the two subsamples. The majority of correlations increase from the first
subsample to the second subsample. The largest increases in correlation include an increase in the
correlation between France and Germany from 0.43 to 0.73, an increase between France and Italy from
0.34 to 0.51, an increase between France and the UK from 0.39 to 0.55 and an increase between Germany
and Italy from 0.29 to 0.51. The average increase in correlation between the first and second subsamples is
0.106. The largest decreases in correlation are between Canada and the UK (0.61 to 0.48) and between the
UK and the US (0.46 to 0.33). The average decrease across the subsamples is 0.11. Because the changes in
the correlation structure are mixed, the change in diversification opportunities across samples is not readily
apparent.
4.3 Exchange Rates
The time series of exchange rates for the seven sample countries are the Datastream weekly
exchange rates. The mean and standard deviation of the sample exchange rates are presented in Table 5.

10

One basis point is one one-hundredth of a percent. Therefore, 100 basis points in equal to one percent.

10

For ease of comparison, the exchange rates are stated in pounds per foreign-currency unit. From the first
sample to the second sample, the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar depreciate against the pound. The
mean Canadian exchange rate decreases by 4.8 percent, from 0.515 pounds per Canadian dollar in the first
subsample to 0.49 pounds per Canadian dollar in the second. The percentage decrease in the mean U.S.
exchange rate is much larger than Canadian decrease. The U.S. exchange rate decreases from 0.688 pounds
per U.S. dollar to 0.58 pounds per U.S. dollar, a 15.6 percent decrease.
From the first subsample to the second subsample, all other currencies appreciate against the
pound. The Deutsche mark exhibits the largest percentage increase in the mean exchange rate of 14.8
percent, from 0.30 pounds per Deutsche mark to 0.344 pounds per Deutsche mark. The percentage increase
in the mean exchange rate of the Japanese yen is slightly lower at 14.7 percent, from 0.377 pounds per 100
yen to 0.432 pounds per 100 yen. The percentage increase in the mean exchange rate for the French franc
and the Italian lire are 8.4 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.
With the exception of the French franc, the standard deviation of the exchange rate for each
currency decreases by an average of thirty-two percent. The standard deviation of the pound-U.S. dollar
exchange rate exhibits the largest decrease of 53.7 percent, from 0.93 to 0.43. The pound-French franc
exchange rate shows a small increase in standard deviation of 3.2 percent, from 0.0074 to 0.0077.
To implement the spanning test, the returns on the extended-set assets are converted into the
currency of the benchmark portfolio. For example, if the benchmark country is France and the Germany
and UK indices are the assets in the extended-set portfolio, the time series of returns for the German and
UK indices are converted into French francs using the appropriate exchange rates. The returns on the
benchmark portfolio are not converted because the returns on the French assets are stated in the local
currency. The strength of the data set is the flexibility to specify any of the sample countries as the
benchmark country. As a result, the benefits of diversification are evaluated from the perspective of an
investor in each country.

5. Do Multinationals Provide Diversification Benefits?
Given their international exposure, equity in multinational corporations is often suggested as an
indirect means of obtaining international diversification benefits free of the impediments and transactions
costs that may be associated with buying equity in foreign markets. In this section, we examine the
diversification benefits of multinational equities from two perspectives. First, multinational equities are
added to a portfolio of domestic equities. Setting up the spanning test in this way reveals the marginal
benefit of adding multinationals to a portfolio of purely domestic stocks. The second test adds multinational
equities to a portfolio that contains domestic equities as well as international equity market indices. This
test reveals the marginal diversification benefits of multinational equities relative to all assets available to
11

the investor. If, for example, the returns of multinational firms tend to "mimic" international markets, the
null hypothesis of spanning would be rejected in the first test but not necessarily in the second. If on the
other hand, multinationals provide diversification benefits that are different from the benefits provided by
international markets, the null hypothesis of spanning could be rejected in the second case.
The significance of the spanning test and the associated utility gain are considered jointly. If the
null hypothesis is rejected, we conclude that the portfolio frontiers are statistically significantly different.
Conditional on the rejection of the null hypothesis, we evaluate the relative magnitude of the utility gain. If
the spanning test fails to reject the null hypothesis that the benchmark portfolio spans the set of broader
assets, measurement of the utility gain is meaningless because we cannot conclude with a high level of
statistical significance that the portfolio frontiers are, in fact, different.
In the first set of tests, the benchmark portfolio is the set of domestic equities and the set of
multinational-corporation equities is specified as the extended-set portfolio. The results of the tests are
reported in Table 6.1. Three sets of results are reported for each country, a test over the full sample and a
test over each of the subsamples. Of the 21 spanning tests reported in Table 6.1, only four tests suggest a
rejection of the null hypothesis at a significance level of less than ten percent. In France, Italy, Japan and
the U.K., the tests fail to reject the null hypothesis that the benchmark portfolio spans the portfolio
comprised of the benchmark and extended-set equities regardless of the sample period. In Canada and
Germany, the null hypothesis of spanning is rejected in the full sample at the 7.8 percent and 1.37 percent
levels of significance, respectively. The null hypothesis is not rejected in these two countries, however, in
either of the two subsamples. In general, the data from markets other than the United States suggest that
multinationals have not provided diversification benefits for domestic investors. In the United States,
however, there is weak evidence that multinationals may have provided some diversification benefits. The
null hypothesis of spanning is rejected at the 6.84 percent level in the full sample and at the 5.89 percent
level in the second subsample.
Table 6.1 also reports the utility gains resulting from the shift in the efficiency frontier as
multinationals are added to the set of domestic assets. In Canada and Germany, the magnitude of the utility
gain from adding multinationals ranges from 2.5 to 5.7 percent, depending on the investor’s degree of risk
aversion. (Recall that the portfolio shift is only significant in the full sample.) The US investor receives the
largest utility gain from adding multinational equities. For the full sample, the relatively less risk-averse US
investor (γ = 2) has a utility gain of 15.33 percent and a utility gain of 8.52 percent if the investor is more
risk-averse (γ = 5). The utility gains over the second subsample range from 14.3 to 24.6 percent. The
finding that U.S. investors could have obtained sizable benefits from holding multinationals may provide
part of the explanation for home bias in the U.S., though it does not resolve the puzzle for other countries.
In the second set of tests (Table 62.), the combined set of domestic equity and international equity
market indicies are specified as the benchmark portfolio and the set of multinational-corporation equities is
specified as the extended-set portfolio. The international market indices are added jointly as an equally12

weighted portfolio. All returns are in unhedged and in local currency units. This test yields the
diversification benefits of multinational equities relative to all available assets, both domestic and
international. Weak evidence for the diversification benefits of multinational equities -- over and above
those attained in international markets -- is found only for Canada and Germany and in both of those cases,
the result holds only in the full sample. Taken together with the results in Table 6.1, our findings suggest
that multinationals offer little diversification benefits in most countries. To the extent that there is weak
evidence of diversification benefits through multinationals in the United States, these benefits result from
the "international" dimension of multinational firms.
6. International Diversification Benefits of Market Indices
In this section, we examine the benefits of adding international stock market indices to a
benchmark portfolio of domestic stocks. To ensure that the domestic portfolio captures all of the possible
diversification benefits available on the domestic market, multinationals are included in the benchmark
portfolio. Because the benchmark portfolio contains the domestic and multinational equities, the spanning
test is the statistical test of the marginal gain from adding an index or set of indices to the domestic
portfolio. We consider the benefits of diversification from the perspective of investors domiciled in each of
the seven countries covered by our study. Because empirical evidence suggests that only a small fraction of
cross-border investment is hedged against exchange rate risk, we consider unhedged returns on the foreign
component of the portfolio.
Each country’s index is added separately to the set of domestic assets in order to consider the
diversification benefits of each country index in isolation. The test results for the individual indices are
reported in columns one through seven of Tables 7.1 through 7.7. Note that the spanning test is not
reported for the market index of the country under consideration. The market index is a linear combination
of the domestic equities and is, therefore, redundant by definition.11
The indices are also added jointly to the set of domestic assets in order to consider the
diversification benefits of the market indices as a group. The market indices are added under two
alternative specifications. The first specification combines the six indices into an equally-weighted
portfolio.12 The results of the spanning tests with respect to the addition of the equally-weighted index are

11

Specifically, the covariance matrix for the set of assets comprised of the benchmark set of assets and the
domestic market index is singular and, therefore, the test statistic is undefined.
12
The equally-weighted portfolio includes all of the indices accept the index for the country under consideration.
Therefore, the equally-weighted portfolio contains six indices. For example, the equally-weighted portfolio for the

13

reported in column 8, which is labeled “Equal-Wt Index.” The second specification does not restrict the
portfolio weights on the market indices. In this case, the extended-set portfolio contains six separate assets.
This specification allows the indices to be held in various proportions, including short positions, along the
portfolio frontier. Because the portfolio weights are unconstrained, the diversification benefits associated
with this specification are found to be substantially larger than the diversification benefits from the addition
of the equally-weighted index. The results of the spanning tests with respect to the addition of set of market
indices are reported in column 9, labeled “All Indices.”
Before turning to the specific results, an important feature of the data is worth noting. The returns
in the Canadian market are low relative to the returns of all other markets over the full sample and in each
of the subsamples. As reported in Table 3.2, the return per unit risk for Canada is by far the lowest of the
sample countries for the full sample and the first subsample and has one of the lowest return per unit risk
ratios in the second subsample. As a result, if the composition of the portfolio is not restricted, an investor
is likely to short the equities with a low return per unit risk and invest the proceeds in other available assets.
Thus, investors from Canada can obtain substantial gains from international diversification through holding
short positions in the domestic market and going long in other markets. Conversely, investors from other
markets may obtain substantial diversification benefits from adding the Canadian index to their portfolio,
taking short positions in Canada and long positions in the other available assets.

US Investor
The US equity market is the largest equity market in the world so reviewing the results for this
market is an appropriate place to begin. Table 7.7 reports the results of the spanning tests and associated
utility gains for an investor holding an initial portfolio of US domestic and multinational equities. Columns
one through six report the results from the addition of each country-specific index to the benchmark
separately and columns eight and nine report the results from the addition of the equally-weighted index and
the six indices added as a group. In spite of being the largest equity market in the world, the null hypothesis
that the US benchmark portfolio spans the portfolio comprised of the benchmark and extended-set equities
is rejected across the board for all test specifications over the full sample. Over the two subsamples, the
null hypothesis is rejected seven out of twelve times.
At first glance, the results of the spanning tests appear to imply that a US investor obtains
significant benefits from international diversification. The magnitude of the utility benefits of
spanning test of German domestic equities contains the market indices for Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the UK
and the US.

14

diversification, however, are somewhat modest. The utility gain over the full sample from adding Germany,
Italy and Japan separately is less than one percent of permanent consumption. The gains from adding
Canada, France and the U.K. range from one to three percent of permanent consumption. In every case the
utility gains from adding the market indices separately or as a group are less than the marginal benefit of
adding multinationals. The utility gain from adding the Canadian index is achieved by constructing a
portfolio that includes a short position in the Canadian index. This implies that, rather than invest heavily
in Canadian equities, US investors would be better off if they held a large short position in the Canadian
market. Given the poor performance of the Canadian market over the sample period, the result that large
utility gains may be obtained from shorting the Canadian index and leveraging a subset of the US portfolio
is not surprising.
The largest utility gains from adding the international-equity indices are obtained from adding the
markets jointly with unrestricted weights. In the full sample, the utility gains are 7.92 percent when the
coefficient of risk aversion is equal to 2 and drops to 4.12 percent when the degree of risk aversion
increases to 5. The gains are achieved by holding a short position in some of the international indices and
long positions in others.
The results of the spanning tests and the corresponding utility gains for the two subsamples are
similar to the full sample results. One difference is worth noting, however. The utility gains over the full
sample are generally smaller than the utility gains over each of the subsamples. This result is obtained
because of sample-specific investment opportunities. The Japanese market is a good example of this
phenomenon. The Japanese market dramatically increased in value over the first subsample and then
dramatically decreased in value over the second subsample. The change is evident in the summary
information presented in Table 3.2. The return per unit risk for Japan in the first time period is 0.2585, the
highest of all of the countries in our study. In the post-July 1988 period, however, the return per unit risk is
-0.0349, the lowest of all of the countries. As a result, the weight on the Japanese index in the utilitymaximizing portfolio for a US investor is positive in the first subsample. To take advantage of the decline
in the value of Japanese equity during the second subsample, the utility-maximizing portfolio contains a
short position in the Japanese index. Similar sample-specific investment opportunities are available for the
other portfolio specifications. Therefore, the increased utility gains in each of the subsamples are a result of
sample-specific opportunities that can not be duplicated over the full sample.
To summarize, if a US investor were to take a stepwise approach to portfolio diversification, the
largest utility gain comes from the inclusion of US multinational equities. Multinationals do not, however,
exhaust the gains from international diversification. U.S. investors could have obtained sizable additional

15

benefits from the addition of international-equity indices although the magnitude of the benefits varies
across countries and across the subsamples. In many cases, the utility benefits were a result of taking large
short positions in foreign markets, which may not be a feasible strategy for most investors.

UK Investor
Table 7.6 reports the results of the spanning tests and associated utility gains for an investor
holding an initial portfolio of UK equities. The results for the individual country-specific indices are
reported in columns one through five, and column seven. Columns eight and nine report the results for the
equally-weighted index and the unrestricted set of six indices, respectively. The null hypothesis that the UK
benchmark portfolio spans the portfolio comprised of the benchmark and foreign market indices is rejected
across the board for all test specifications over the full sample and the second subsample at the five percent
level. The first subsample contains only 81 observations and, as a result, the null hypothesis is rejected only
for France and the US at the ten percent level of significant.
Focusing on the results for the full sample and the second subsample, the utility gains for the UK
investor vary across markets. The smallest utility gain over the full sample is an increase of 0.18 percent of
permanent consumption from the addition of the French index. The largest gain from an individual index is
8.25 percent for the Italian index. The utility gains for the equally-weighted index and the unrestricted set
of six indices are larger than the gains from any individual index. The gains range from approximately 2
percent to 14 percent, depending on the parameterization of γ and θ. The utility gains over the second
subsample are roughly of the same magnitude of those in the full sample. The utility gains range from zero
percent (γ = 2,θ = 2) for the French index to 12 percent (γ = 2,θ = 2) for the Japanese index. The second
subsample utility gains are largest for the unrestricted set of indices. Analogous to the findings for the US
investor, the large utility gains of the UK investor are achieved by holding very large short positions in the
benchmark and extended-set equities.

16

Japanese Investor
The returns on the Japanese equities that are summarized in Tables 1.5 and 2.4 may be upwardly
biased because the data reported by Datastream includes only currently-traded Japanese equities.13 The bias
of the data results in an investment strategy that leverages against the structure of Japanese returns to
obtain large utility gains. Over the full sample and first subsample in which the Japanese returns are
relatively high, an investor domiciled in Japan constructs a portfolio with a long position in Japanese
equities and a short position in the other available assets. Over the second subsample in which Japanese
returns are poor, a Japanese investor holds a short position in a subset of Japanese equities and a long
position in the remaining Japanese equities and the other available equities. This data feature is responsible
for many of the significant diversification gains associated with the Japanese benchmark portfolio.
The null hypothesis that the Japanese benchmark portfolio spans the portfolio comprised of the
benchmark and extended-set of international equities is rejected for all test specifications over the full
sample and each of the subsamples (see Table 7.5). The single exception is the failure to reject the null
when “all indices” are added in the second subsample. The results indicate that international diversification
by a Japanese investor significantly shifts the portfolio frontier and that the associated utility gains are
relatively large. The results should be considered with caution given the aforementioned bias in the
Japanese data.
In the first subsample, the addition of the Canadian index to the Japanese benchmark portfolio
yields the largest utility gain of any of the individual indices. This result is due to the fact that the Canadian
index was a poor performer over this time period while Japanese equities performed relatively well. A
Japanese investor (with excellent foresight!) would take advantage of the structure of returns by holding a
short position in a subset of Japanese equities and the Canadian index and by holding a long position in the
remaining Japanese equities. Because the Canadian index and the Japanese equities both yielded relatively
low returns in the second subsample, the strategy to short the Canadian market yields sub-optimal utility
gains. The utility gains from this strategy are still sizable (11 percent of permanent consumption) but are
smaller than the gains of holding large long positions in other, better-performing markets.
Over the full sample, the addition of each of the five international indices separately yields smaller
utility gains than the addition of the equally-weighted index or the set of six international indices. The
greater utility gain associated with the equally-weighted index indicates that the investor is better off by
investing in a broad international index than by selectively investing in any of the country-specific indices.
13

There were few bankruptcies in Japan during the time period studied here so the extent of bias could be small.
The Japanese index is not constructed from our firm-level data and therefore does not contain survivorship bias.

17

The ability to adjust the portfolio weights for the group of international indices more than doubles the
utility gain.
Like the results for the U.S., the utility gains over the two subsamples are larger than the utility
gains over the full sample. This is again due to the ability of the investor to take advantage of samplespecific investment opportunities. The largest utility gains are associated with a short position in
international equities and a sub-set of Japanese equities and a long position in the remaining Japanese
equities. subsampleThese portfolios yield substantial utility gains, however, the feasibility of such a
portfolio is questionable. It is also unlikely that such extreme strategies would perform well in out-ofsample tests.

Canadian Investor
In the full sample and the first subsample, the null hypothesis that the domestic portfolio spans the
extended-set portfolio is rejected for each of the country-specific indices separately, and for the equallyweighted international market index (see Table 7.1). Over the full sample, the largest benefits come from
the addition of France and the United Kingdom to the set of domestic stocks. Again the largest gains are
due to the addition of the set of six international indices, which allow the investor to take long and short
positions in different markets. The fact that Canadian returns were relatively low during this sample period
has already been noted. The optimal strategy for Canadian investors is to hold a long position in the
international market indices and hold short positions in the domestic market. Viewed from this perspective,
the home bias in Canadian portfolios becomes even more puzzling.
In the full sample, the null hypothesis that the domestic portfolio spans the extended-set portfolio is
rejected at the one percent significance level for each of the country-specific indices, for the equallyweighted index and the set of all indices. The largest benefits from an individual country index come from
the addition of France and the United Kingdom to the set of domestic stocks. Again the largest gains are
due to the addition of the set of six international indices, which allows the investor to take long and short
positions in different markets. Six of eight tests in the first subsample and three of eight tests in the second
subsample are rejected at the five percent significance level. The fact that Canadian returns were relatively
low during the sample period has already been noted. The optimal strategy for Canadian investors is to hold

18

a long position in the international market indices and hold short positions in the domestic market. Viewed
from this perspective, the home bias in Canadian portfolios becomes even more puzzling. 14

French, German and Italian Investors
For investors from France, Germany, and Italy (Tables 7.2 through 7.4), the null hypothesis of
spanning can be rejected in almost all cases at the five percent level of significance. The exceptions are the
addition of France and Italy to the German portfolio during the first subsample and the addition of the set
of all indices in the firs subsample for the set of domestic French assets. Due to the truncated sample for
Italy during the first subsample, only two of the eight spanning tests are rejected at the five percent
significance level. The utility gains for France are relatively small, with one notable exception. In both
subsamples, the addition of Japan to the set of French domestic equities yields dramatically high utility
gains. Again, this is due to the exploitation of sample-specific properties of Japanese returns and involves
large leveraged positions.
Similarly in Germany, the utility gains are relatively small with the exception of the addition of
Canada in the full sample and Japan in the second subsample. The utility gains from adding the Canadian
index are obtained by shorting the Canadian index, and the gains from adding the Japanese index are
obtained by holding a long position in the Japanese index. Surprisingly, the addition of the Italian index in
the second subsample increases German utility by a moderately large 5.16 percent for the coefficient of risk
aversion is equal to 2. subsampleFor Italy, the largest utility gains are due to the addition of Japan to the
benchmark portfolio, 34.07 percent (γ = 2,θ = 2) and 28.67 percent (γ = 5,θ = 2) for the first subsample
and 4.06 percent (γ = 2,θ = 2) and 1.60 percent (γ = 5,θ = 2) for the second subsample.

7. Conclusion
Three key conclusions may be drawn from our research. First, ex post, there is weak evidence that
investment in multinationals could have provided diversification benefits for U.S. investors over the 198892 period. Thus, U.S. home bias during this period could be explained by the indirect international
diversification opportunities available to investors at home. Second, the addition of international assets
provided further benefits to a benchmark portfolio that includes domestic stocks as well as the stocks of
multinationals. The utility gains from diversification vary depending on the assets added to the benchmark
14

Until recently, Canada has maintained some controls on the level of ownership of foreign stock. It is not clear
that the restrictions were binding, however, because the amount of Canadian holdings of foreign equity was wellbelow the legal limitations (see Tesar and Werner, 1994).

19

portfolio. Often the largest gains are obtained from the addition of the equally-weighted index and the set of
six international indices rather than from the addition of a single foreign market. This result is not
surprising given the vast literature on the benefits of international diversification. Third, the utility gains
from international diversification are in some cases very substantial but are often obtainable only by
holding large long or short positions. If investors face substantial costs in taking short positions, the gains
from international diversification may be limited. The sources of the gains from diversification vary across
samples and, as a result, a strategy for future portfolio allocations is not readily apparent.
In future work, we plan to utilize this data set to explore a number of other issues related to the
benefits of global diversification. First, tests of the spanning hypothesis and an analysis of the associated
utility gains for international diversification subject to short-selling constraints would be useful. This test
specification would determine if an investor subject to reasonable allocational constraints could obtain
sizable utility gains from international diversification. Such an analysis may indicate that the large utility
gains are overstated if the investor cannot leverage the portfolio. Second, current research indicates that
investment in emerging markets yields substantial diversification benefits. Expanding the set of available
assets to include the emerging market indices would be interesting in the testing framework presented
above. The results would indicate the magnitude of the utility gains and the portfolio allocations needed to
obtain the gains in utility. Finally, all of the results here are based on ex post sample returns. In future
work, we plan to examine the benefits of global diversification in a framework that takes into account the
investor's uncertainty about future returns.

Appendix A

Equity Classification Methodology

Datastream classifies firms according to country of origin and industry. The primary classification
is by country of origin. American depository receipts, global depository receipts and cross-listed securities
are omitted from Datastream’s country-specific classification of firms.15 We follow Datastream’s
classification hierarchy and use four broad industry categories as defined by Datastream: consumer goods
and services (CGS), energy and utilities (EU), finance and real estate (FIR) and industrials (IND). Firms
that do not have a valid Datastream industry classification are assigned the industry classification other
(OTHER).16 Firms that are classified as OTHER may have unobservable characteristics that distinguish
them from the firms in the four categories. If the OTHER category remains distinct, the portfolio selection
process may be biased. To reduce this potential bias, the OTHER category is incorporated into the four
industry categories. The methodology is explained below.17
We construct the firm size classification within each industry by using a size-sorting algorithm
based on the annual observations of each firm’s market capitalization denominated in the local currency. If
a firm has no market capitalization during the sample period, it is dropped from the sample. A firm may
have a reported market capitalization of zero. Datastream measures market capitalization in millions of
local currency units. We assume that a firm that has a reported market capitalization of zero either has a
true capitalization equal to zero or has a true capitalization that is positive and a reported capitalization of
zero due to rounding. Including firms with reported market capitalizations equal to zero and true market
capitalizations greater than zero biases the size sorting algorithm such that the marginal firm in a size
category is classified as smaller than it actually is.

15

Datastream documentation states that the lists of firms by country do not include cross-listed securities. (Find
specific reference.) We performed a secondary check to ensure that cross-listed securities are not omitted from the
sample.
16
For example, a firm whose trading has been suspended is classified by Datastream as a suspended firm. This
designation overlays the industry classification. As a result, the industry classification cannot be determined from
the information available from Datastream.
17
Firms whose trading has been suspended comprise the majority of the firms that are included in the OTHER
category. We infer from this status that the firms are poor performers. If the OTHER category contains a
disproportionately high number of poor performers, the four other categories contain a disproportionately low
number of poor performers. We assume that the investor cannot identify poor performers a priori, therefore, the
investor could not construct the OTHER category a priori.

50

The firms are classified into small, medium and large categories such that approximately one third
of the total industry market capitalization falls into each size category. If each size category contains
exactly one third of the industry’s market capitalization, the value-weighted portfolio weights for each size
category in each industry are equal to one third. This methodology provides a reference point for a
comparison of the weights derived from mean-variance optimization and the value-weighted portfolio
weights.
To allocate firms in this way, the total market capitalization for each industry category is
calculated for each set of annual observations. The firms within each industry are sorted by market
capitalization in descending order. Beginning with the largest firm in each industry and proceeding with
progressively smaller firms, the market capitalizations are summed until the accumulated total is greater
than or equal to one third of the industry market capitalization. The market capitalization of the last firm
that is added to the accumulated total is the reference point that partitions the medium-sized firms from the
large-sized firms. Denote the market capitalization of this firm at time t as MtM/L. The process of summing
the market capitalizations continues until the accumulated total is greater than or equal to two thirds of the
industry market capitalization. The market capitalization of the last firm that is added to the accumulated
total is the reference point that partitions the small-sized firms from the medium-sized firms. Denote the
market capitalization of this firm as MtS/M.
The methodology described above is used to calculate the values of MtS/M and MtM/L conditional on
the market capitalizations of firms that begin trading prior to the first year of the sample or begin trading in
the first year of the sample. As new firms begin trading and old firms cease trading over time, the market
capitalization of each industry changes. Rather than recalculate MtS/M and MtM/L at each point in time
conditional on the market capitalizations of all firms at time t, the values of MtS/M and MtM/L for time
periods after the first year of the sample are scaled to reflect the growth rate in the market capitalization of
the industry. For example, if the consumer goods and services industry’s market capitalization grows by
five percent from the first year to the second year, M2S/M is equal to M1S/M times 1.05. As a result, a firm’s
size is determined only once during the sample and a firm’s size classification cannot change during the
sample period.
If MtS/M and MtM/L were recalculated each year using the market capitalizations of all firms at time
t, a small successful firm with an increasing market capitalization could be reclassified as a larger firm and
an unsuccessful firm with a diminishing market capitalization could be reclassified as a smaller firm. If the
size classification of a firm is permitted to vary with the firm’s success or failure, the portfolio weights
would be a function of the size classification. The investor would hold relatively more of the large, i.e.

51

successful, firms and relatively less of the small, i.e. unsuccessful, firms. The portfolio weights would be a
function of survivorship bias. By classifying the size of the firm only once, the effects of survivorship bias
are reduced.
A firm is designated as a domestic or multinational firm conditional on the listing of multinational
corporations in Worldwide Branch Locations of Multinational Companies (1994). The primary criteria for
inclusion in the listing is the existence of one or more branches, subsidiaries, manufacturing plants or other
holdings located in countries other than the country in which the corporation is headquartered. This
selection criteria for multinational corporations is relatively narrow. A broader definition would include all
firms with a large percentage of corporate sales outside the country in which the corporation is
headquartered. We assume the list of firms with one or more branches, subsidiaries, manufacturing plants
or other holdings located in countries other than the country in which the corporation is headquartered is
highly correlated with the list of firms that fulfill the broader definition of a multinational firm.
The list includes five hundred multinational corporations. Approximately two hundred are
headquartered in the United States and the majority of the remaining three hundred are headquartered in
Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and Sweden. This classification methodology
captures the largest and most prominent multinational corporations. Because these firms have a physical
presence in other countries, the firms are directly affected by international economic conditions. Firms that
have international sales and no international physical presence are less directly affected by international
economic conditions.

Sample Selection and Sample Construction Methodology
Conditional on the classification of the firms, a random sample is drawn for each category. Define
the initial set of the firms for each category as the population and the random sample from each category as
the sample.18 The maximum number of firms in the sample for each category is arbitrary set at thirty firms.
If the number of firms in a category population is less than thirty, all of the firms are included in the sample
portfolio.19 The size of the category sample is reported in the second column of Table 1. For example, the
sample size for medium, domestic, finance-and-real-estate firms in Canada is 7.
Datastream provides returns data on firms that are currently traded and firms that are not currently
traded but were traded in the past. For firms that are no longer traded, Datastream does not, however,

18

The database of firms that are available from Datastream is not the true population of firms. For ease of
discussion, consider it the population of Datastream firms.
19
The names of the firms included in each category subsample are available from the authors upon request.

52

provide information regarding the disposition of the firm on the last day that it was traded. This
shortcoming implies that a bankrupt firm can be easily be distinguished from a firm that has been acquired
by another firm. As a result, the return series must be edited to reflect the final status of the firm. If the
firm went bankrupt, the investor is assumed to have lost the entire amount of the investment and the last
return observation is set equal to minus one. If the firm merged with another firm or was acquired by
another firm, the investor is assumed to receive the amount of the investment on the day of the last observed
return. The investor is assumed to reinvest the proceeds in the portfolio. The last observed return as stated
by Datastream, which reflects the capital appreciation and any dividend disbursement over the last period,
is not altered.
The primary source used to determine the final status of individual firms is Standard & Poor’s
Standard Corporate Descriptions (1996). Standard & Poor reports the final disposition of individual
securities. In addition to Standard & Poor, Canada Stockwatch, an on-line securities database, is used to
verify the final status of some Canadian firms. If these sources do not provide the needed information, the
final status of the firm is inferred from the return series and the price series for each individual firm. As a
rule of thumb, the firm is assumed to be bankrupt if the time series of prices for the firm’s equity
approaches zero as the date approaches the final day of trading. The firm is assumed to be acquired by
another firm or merged with another firm if the time series of prices for the firm’s equity is significantly
different from zero as the date approaches the final day of trading. In cases such that the final status of the
firm is ambiguous, the firm is assumed to be bankrupt.20
Conditional on the random sample of firms by category, a value-weighted portfolio is constructed
for each category sample. The firms are chosen randomly from the list of firms for each category. A firm is
included in the list if its equity traded during any part of the time series of returns. This selection
methodology biases the sample portfolio because firms that trade for a short period of time are overrepresented in the list of firms and firms that trade for a long period of time are under-represented in the list
of firms. To demonstrate this bias, consider an example. Suppose the sample for small, domestic, industrial
firms in Canada is comprised of fifty firms. Forty-five of the firms are traded for six months of the sample
time period and five firms are traded for five years of the sample time period. The sample of thirty firms is
chosen from the list of fifty firms. This selection methodology implies that each firm is equally likely to be
included in the subsample portfolio. If the sample portfolio is constructed on a period-by-period basis
however, each firm does not have an equal probability of being included in the sample portfolio. The firms

A summary of the status for all firms, both currently traded and not traded, is available from the authors upon
request.

53

that trade for a long period of time have a higher probability of being traded at any point in time and
therefore have a higher probability of inclusion in the period-specific subsample portfolio. To reduce the
bias of the sample selection methodology, the weights of the sample portfolio are a function of the value of
the firm relative to the total value of all the firms in the category and the relative length of the time series of
returns for each firm. The weight for each equity in the sample portfolio is equal to

where ωit is equal to the portfolio weight on asset i at time t, mvit is equal to the market value of firm i at
time t, ni is equal to the number of observations in the time series of returns for firm i, NS is the number of
firms in the sample and λt is an adjustment factor that ensures that the weights of the portfolio sum to one
for each time period. Combining the time series of returns for the firms in each sample yields one time
series of returns for each category.
The portfolio for each category is augmented to incorporate the return series of the OTHER
category because the characteristics of the firms in the OTHER category may not be readily identifiable apriori. The three size classifications of the OTHER category are individually incorporated into the size
categories of the other four industry classifications. For example, the small OTHER category is
incorporated into the small categories of the other four industry categories. The return series are combined
conditional on the relative market value of each category. The augmented return series is a linear
combination of the industry return series and the return series of the OTHER category,

(

ritA = rit ωitA + rOt 1 − ωAit

(A.2)

)

where ritA is the augmented return of industry category i at time t, rit is the return of industry i at time t, ωitA
is the augmented weight on industry i at time t, and (1 - ωitA) is the augmented weight on the other category
at time t. 21
Constructing the augmented weight on industry i is a two step process. The first step is the
calculation of the percent of total market value of each size category for each industry:

where zit is the percent of total market value of industry i, mvjt is the market value of firm j at time t, and Nj
is the number of firms in the sample of industry j. For categories where the number of firms in the
population is greater than thirty, the total market value of the category is approximated as the average
market value of a firm in the category sample times the number of firms in the category’s population.

N i is the number of firms in the category sample. For example, suppose that the zits for the medium sized
CGS, EU, FIR, IND and OTHER categories are 0.30, 0.10, 0.20, 0.35 and 0.05, respectively. For this
example, the IND category is the largest category as measured by market capitalization and the OTHER
category is the smallest.
The second step in the construction of the augmented weight is to apportion the return series of the
OTHER category to each of the four industry categories in proportion to their percent market value.
Therefore, the augmented weight for industry i at time t, witA, is equal to
(A.5)

ωitA =

z it
z it + z it z Ot

where zOt is the percent of total market value of the OTHER category. Using this apportionment
methodology and the example percentages from step 1, twenty percent of the return series of the OTHER
category, which comprises five percent of the total, is apportioned to the CGS category. The weights for
combining the CGS category and the OTHER category would be 0.9524 and 0.0476, respectively.
Therefore the augmented return for the CGS category would be

= rCGSt (0.9524) + rOt (0.0476) .
