In fact, there are exactly 2,118 goods and 2,118
factors. You did know that, didn't you?
Edward Leamer (1984)

I. Introduction
Trade economists regularly build models in which the number of goods exceeds, equals, or
is less than the number of factors. These seemingly innocuous variations in model structure have
profound implications regarding the ability of general-equilibrium models to explain production
patterns. In models where the number of goods exceeds the number of factors, output and hence
trade flows can no longer be determined solely on the basis of a country’s factor endowments.
Indeed, it is precisely because of this potential indeterminacy of trade and production that many
tests of the factor abundance theory have focused on the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) model.
This formulation posits a relationship between factor endowments and the factor services that are
embodied in goods trade. According to the HOV model, countries will export the services of
relatively abundant factors and import the services of relatively scarce factors.
Though the HOV model generates precise predictions of trade in factor services, more
often economists are interested in using factor endowments to estimate commodity trade flows.
This task generally requires the existence of what we call the “factor-endowments-driven” (FED)
model of production, which provides the foundation for a common, one-to-one mapping of factor
endowments into outputs.1 A necessary condition for this relationship to hold is the existence of
an equal number of goods and factors. Consequently, the empirical literature has tended to rely
implicitly or explicitly upon the “even case” or “square model,” i.e., the implausible assumption
that there are equal numbers of goods and factors. This assumption has troubled empirical trade
economists, even though they often adopted it for convenience. As Leamer and Levinsohn (1995,
p. 1363) remark in their survey of the empirical trade literature, “one rather awkward assumption

1

By “common” we mean that the function linking outputs to endowments is the same across all countries and
independent of factor endowments.

2
that cries out for change is that of equal numbers of commodities and factors. After all, we really
don’t know how to count either.”
While we agree that it is not possible to determine the number of goods and factors by
counting them, we argue that the observed production patterns are consistent only with a world in
which the number of goods exceeds the number of factors. Our claim is predicated on the
following empirical prediction. Namely, if there are more goods than factors, then even in cases
where the HOV model holds, it should not be possible to predict output on the basis of
endowments—i.e., the FED model of production should fail. We implement this test on Japanese
prefectural data, analyzing whether factor endowments determine the location of production or
whether outputs are indeterminate. Even for this sample of Japanese regions in which the HOV
model of production holds, we find that the FED model fails, as indicated by enormous
indeterminacy in production patterns. This is the first empirical verification that production
indeterminacy arising from the existence of more goods than factors is a major problem for
predicting specialization.
Furthermore, we show that the estimated coefficients obtained from regressing output or
trade on factor endowments, often called “Rybczynski derivatives,” are not linked to the
underlying technology in the way required by theory. Therefore they cannot be interpreted as
providing information about a structural relationship between output and factor endowments.
This means that regressions of output or trade on factor endowments have weak theoretical
foundations.
When we use an international data set, surprisingly much of the indeterminacy in the
location of production disappears.

That is, residuals from regressions of output on factor

endowments are far larger for a data set of regions with negligible to low trade costs than for a
data set of countries with presumably higher and more ubiquitous costs of trade. We interpret
this finding as evidence in support of the hypothesis that trade costs help to render international
production patterns determinate. However, the fact that the production patterns appear to be
more predictable in the presence of trade costs undermines a major application of regressions of

3
trade on factor endowments: attempts to identify trade barriers on the basis of prediction errors
from these regressions. Indeed, this phenomenon may explain the puzzle identified by Pritchett
(1996), namely the significant negative correlations between conventional measures of protection
and the estimated trade barriers derived from regressions of trade on factor endowments.

II. Background
The Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model was originally formulated with two factors and
two goods. In this simple 2 × 2 (two goods, two factors) world, it is easy to derive the major
trade theorems (Factor Price Equalization, Rybczynski, Heckscher-Ohlin, and StolperSamuelson). Extensions of this model into multigood, multifactor versions are considerably more
complicated, and even in the “square” N × N case, most of the strong results of the 2 × 2 model
cannot be duplicated without exotic and often unrealistic assumptions on the structure of
technology [see Ethier (1984)].

Nevertheless, the N × N model is analytically convenient,

especially since in this case the effect of factor endowments on output (i.e., the Rybczynski
derivatives or, equivalently, the Stolper-Samuelson effects) can be obtained by regressing output
(or goods trade) on factor endowments.2
Economists have often conjectured, however, that there are more goods than factors [see,
for example, Melvin (1968), Bhagwati (1972), Travis (1972), and Rader (1979)]. The reason is
simple. One can easily imagine a myriad of different goods, but it is difficult to conceive of more
than a handful of factors: several categories of labor, a few kinds of capital, various types of land,
and several mineral and energy resources.3 Fortunately, the theoretical implications of having
2The

Rybczynski derivatives are the result of first differentiating the revenue function with respect to price
and second with respect to factor endowments. These derivatives relate how output moves when factor
endowments change. The Stolper-Samuelson effects are simply the result of differentiating the revenue function
with respect to factor endowments first and price second. These derivatives link wages and prices. Young’s
theorem guarantees that the two sets of derivatives are the same.
3Of course, if factors are specific to industries, then the potential number of factors increases dramatically.
Some canonical trade models are predicated upon a large number of factors, such as the pure exchange model,
where all factors are sector-specific, or the Ricardo-Viner model, where there is one mobile factor in addition to
sector-specific factors. But these models are not the subject of much empirical work, as Leamer and Levinsohn
(1995, p. 1345) remark. Also, these models are usually thought to capture short-run behavior, and not the longrun determinants of comparative advantage.

4
more goods than factors are well-known. Ethier (1984) cites no fewer than nine works that deal
with the issue, starting with Samuelson (1953).
Vanek (1968) examined extensions of the Heckscher-Ohlin model to cases in which there
are more goods than factors.4 His main contribution was to demonstrate that it still was possible
to obtain a version of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem expressed in terms of trade in factor services:
i.e., a country will be a net exporter of the services of factors in which it is relatively abundant.
Unfortunately, in a world with more than two goods and factors, it becomes impossible to identify
the factor intensity of industries and so the Rybczynski theorem and its corollary, the HeckscherOhlin theorem, can be expressed only as relationships between technology matrices, trade or
output vectors, and factor endowment vectors. Still, as long as there are an equal number of
goods and factors and the production techniques are common and independent, these theorems
specify a unique mapping from factor endowments into output or trade.
With more goods than factors, however, most of the basic trade theorems no longer apply.
The Factor Price Equalization theorem remains valid as long as endowments are not too
dissimilar. Unfortunately, when there are more than two goods and factors, as Ethier (1984, p.
158) notes, “the strong Stolper-Samuleson property that commodity price changes produce
unambiguous changes in all factor rewards runs into serious limitations,” and only a far weaker
version of the Stolper-Samuelson theorem can be maintained. Most significant for our purposes,
the existence of more goods than factors renders it impossible to achieve a common one-to-one
mapping of endowments into outputs. Consequently, all attempts to predict trade flows on the
basis of factor endowments have relied, at least implicitly, on the “square” assumption of equal
numbers of goods and factors.
It is largely because of the fact that square models generate so many powerful results that
these models hold a special place in international trade theory. Although many empirical papers
have focused on the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) formulation of the model—which focuses on

4As

Anderson (1981) points out, Travis (1964) also derived a similar result, but in the subsequent
literature it has become commonly associated with Vanek's name.

5
trade in factor services rather than commodity trade—more often researchers have sought to
generate estimates of trade or production on the basis of factor endowments, relying on what we
call the “factor-endowments-driven” (FED) model of production.5 Three major users of this
methodology are authors seeking to test trade models [e.g., Leamer (1984), Maskus (1991),
Harrigan (1995), and Davis and Weinstein (1996)]; those attempting to identify trade barriers or
industrial policy interventions [e.g., Saxonhouse (1983, 1986, 1989), Leamer (1988a, b), and
Noland (1993)]; and consumers of the preceding literature, who employ their estimates of trade
barriers in studies of trade policy and economic growth [e.g., Edwards (1992), Levine and Renelt
(1992), and Gould and Gruben (1996)].
Many of these studies have tried to predict trade flows on the basis of factor endowments.
However, Harrigan (1995) was the first to realize that one can estimate Heckscher-Ohlin-type
relationships by focusing on production rather than trade.6 He examined whether the production
patterns of 20 OECD countries could be predicted from their factor endowments. Using 16 years
of annual data, he regressed 10 manufacturing sectors on seven factors. He found that differences
in factor endowments accounted for much of the variation in output; however, expressed as a percent of actual production, the average prediction error was close to 40 percent. From this
evidence Harrigan concluded that the factor-abundance production model had little explanatory
power.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to identify in Harrigan’s work exactly why the fits were so
poor.

The theory is static and intended to explain cross-sectional variation, but Harrigan

estimated it as a time series with country fixed effects. Consequently, his coefficient estimates are
influenced by movements in technology which in general may be difficult to characterize. As
Davis and Weinstein (1996) note, this makes it unclear whether the empirical failure described by

5See

footnote 12 below for some examples of empirical investigations of the HOV equation.
Davis, Weinstein et al. (1997) have noted, the intellectual capital of the HOV theory is staked on the
production side. The Factor Price Equalization, Rybczynski, and Stolper-Samuelson theorems make no use of the
consumption model at all, and the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem is basically a corollary to the Rybczynski theorem
with the added assumption of identical homothetic preferences.
6As

6
Harrigan is due to problems in the FED model of production itself or in the way in which the
matrix of Rybczynski derivatives is constrained to vary across time.
The Harrigan study also raises the question of whether the FED model of production is
inherently flawed because of a violation of a core assumption of the model, such as constant
returns to scale or equal numbers of goods and factors, or whether there are problems in the data
that prevent the model from fitting an international sample. Problems in the latter category
include measurement error, missing factors, government policy, and the failure of factor price
equalization in some of the countries in the sample.
The major insight in this paper is the recognition that by using Japanese prefectural data
rather than cross-country data, we can substantially simplify the analysis and rule out most of the
potential reasons why the FED production model might fail.7 We work with a set of regions for
which there exists a technology matrix that accurately maps production into endowments. We
can therefore largely rule out the possibility of failure due to scale economies, a lack of factor
price equalization, measurement error, and government policy. Even in this best-case scenario,
we find that the FED model of production performs miserably. This allows us to focus on two
possible reasons for failure: missing factors and production indeterminacy arising from the
existence of more goods than factors. Our inability to find additional factors that can help explain
production patterns leads us to conclude that indeterminacy is the likely culprit.
Oddly enough, when we turn to international data which Davis, Weinstein et al. (1997)
found to be poorly described by the HOV model of production, we obtain significantly better fits
from regressions of output on endowments. The fact that the FED model of production describes
international data better than regional data supports the notion that trade costs work to constrain
the range of possible production patterns. There is an important caveat, however. The errors in
cross-sectional regressions are almost twice the magnitude of those calculated by Harrigan (1995)

7Krugman

(1991, p. 3) argues for this kind of approach, writing that "one of the best ways to understand
how the international economy works is to start by looking at what happens inside nations. . . The data will be
better and pose fewer problems of compatibility, and the underlying economic forces will be less distorted by
government policies."

7
using fixed-effects estimation. We interpret these results as evidence that trade costs help resolve
indeterminacy but fail to produce neat linear mappings from factor endowments into output.

III. Dimensionality, Production, and Trade: Theory and Tests
In this section we illustrate how production and factor endowments are linked together in
models where production is determinate and where production is indeterminate. The objective is
to show how theory can help us distinguish between these two possible worlds. We begin by
establishing some notation. Let N denote the number of goods, F represent the number of
factors, and r index regions (where r ∈ R). For each region r, Xr is the N × 1 vector of gross
outputs, Vr the F × 1 vector of factor endowments, and Br the F × N matrix of direct factor input
requirements.

A. Testing for Identical Production Techniques
We now make the standard assumptions about production inherent in the HeckscherOhlin-Vanek model. First, we assume that technology is identical across regions and exhibits
constant returns to scale.

Furthermore, we assume that regional endowments are not too

divergent so as to preclude factor price equalization (FPE), goods and factor markets are
perfectly competitive, and the number of goods is at least as large as the number of factors (N ≥
F). If these conditions are satisfied, then it can be shown that production techniques will be
identical across regions, i.e. that Br = B ∀ r ∈ R. Moreover, for each prefecture we can write:8
BXr = Vr

∀ r ∈ R (Dimension F × 1)

These R sets of equations can be expressed more compactly as
BX = V

(Dimension F × R)

(1)

where B is the common F × N technology matrix, and X is an N × R matrix whose columns
consist of the output vectors for each region, and V is a F × R matrix whose columns are the
8It

is important to clarify one potential source of confusion about this equation. If we let J denote Japan as
a whole, BXJ must equal VJ by definition. However, as Davis, Weinstein et al. (1997) discuss in considerable
detail, there is no guarantee that BXr will equal Vr for each region within Japan.

8
endowment vectors for each region. The columns of the left-hand side of equation (1) represent
the measured factor content of production for each region and the columns of the right-hand side
are the actual factor endowment vectors. 9 Hence equation (1) tells us that the measured factor
content of production should equal the actual regional endowment.
We refer to equation (1) as the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) model of production.
Notice that this relationship can fail because of technological differences, increasing returns, or
any other reason why factor price equalization might not obtain. If we find that equation (1) does
hold, however, then we can conclude that whatever violations of the HOV theorem’s basic
assumptions exist, they are not sufficient to undermine the theory’s predictions about output.
We will take two strategies toward testing equation (1). First, following Harrigan (1995),
we examine prediction errors; second, following Ethier (1984), we calculate Rybczynski
“correlations.”

10

To do so, we note that equality of the BX and V matrices in equation (1)

implies equality for each corresponding element of the two matrices; i.e., for each factor f and
region r,
[BfXr] = [Vfr]

(Dimension 1 × 1)

(1')

where Bf denotes the fth row of the technology matrix and Vfr the fth element of Vr. Obviously it is
too much to expect that equation (1') will hold exactly. Instead we look at the percentage
deviation between the predicted factor content of production and the actual factor endowment. In
practice, this involves first creating an F × R matrix, D, whose elements are defined below:
Dfr = |BfXr/Vfr – 1|.
If the errors are small, we conclude that the HOV model provides a reasonably accurate
description of production structure. If there are substantial errors, we conclude that the model is
deficient in some respect.

9Our

nomenclature here follows the literature, in which the endowment estimates that are imputed from
information on outputs and technology are referred to as the “measured” endowments, while the endowments taken
from the data sample are termed the “actual” endowments.
10Strictly speaking, these are not true correlations but are “on average” relationships analogous to the
well-known multigood comparative advantage “correlations” between exports and relative autarky prices derived
by Dixit and Norman (1980) and Deardorff (1980).

9
We could in principle examine all of the elements of D at once, but it is analytically
convenient to consider two types of average prediction errors. First, looking at the column of D
corresponding to a given region r, we can compare the actual endowments and measured factor
absorption for each region. Second, we can hold f fixed and consider the corresponding row of
D, comparing the actual endowments and measured factor usage across all regions. In this way
we distinguish how well the model fits individual regions as well as particular factors.
It is not sufficient to stop here, however. Tests of the HOV production model based on
equation (1') are incomplete, since they could conceivably yield misleading conclusions in certain
instances. For example, suppose that all regions had identical factor proportions but differed only
in size. In this case prediction errors might be very small because larger regions just produce
more of everything, but we might not have any information about whether differences in relative
factor proportions are associated with outputs in the manner specified by theory. What we need
is some way of addressing the question of whether differences in relative factor proportions
translate into differences in observed production patterns as theory predicts.
Fortunately, this problem has already been largely worked out by Ethier (1984). With two
goods and two factors, the Rybczynski theorem maintains that holding output prices constant, an
increase in the endowment of some factor will generate a more-than-proportional increase in the
output of the good that uses that factor intensively and a reduction in the output of the other
good. In higher dimensions (N > 2 goods, F > 2 factors), the relationship between endowments
and production must be stated quite differently.11
In particular, our empirical tests impose restrictions based upon Ethier’s multidimensional
formulation of the Rybczynski relationship. Suppose for two regions r and r' ∈ R we have BXr =
Vr and BXr' = V r'. We can then subtract one equation from the other to get: B(Xr – Xr') = (Vr –
Vr').

Premultiplying both sides by the transpose of (Vr – Vr') yields Ethier’s Rybczynski

“correlation”:

11Another

test involves verifying that, for each industry and each factor, at least one Rybczynski
derivative is negative. With the large number of sectors included in our study, this test is not particularly powerful.

10
(Vr - Vr')T B(Xr - Xr') = (Vr - Vr')T (Vr - Vr') > 0

(Dimension 1 × 1)

(2)

For each pair of regions (r, r'), equation (2) says that regions with more (less) of a
particular factor generally produce goods which use that factor relatively more (less) intensively.
If we examine this relationship for all r and r', we can group the left- and right-hand sides of
equation (2) into two R × R symmetric matrices.

According to theory, all the elements

comprising these matrices should be non-negative, and the diagonal elements should be zeroes.
For the matrix whose elements correspond to right-hand side of equation (2), it is a mathematical
truism that these conditions are fulfilled. However, for the matrix comprised of the left-hand-side
terms, there is no guarantee that the off-diagonal elements are non-negative.
We can improve Ethier’s formulation with a slight modification. One drawback of the
above approach is that it pools together information garnered from different factors. To see this,
consider what theory tells us the relationship should look like for any factor f. Just as equation
(1') describes the production equation of the HOV model in terms of a particular factor and
region, there is an analogous expression for Ethier’s multidimensional Rybczynski “correlation”:
(Vfr- Vfr')Bf (Xr – Xr') = (Vfr- Vfr')2 > 0

∀ f, r, and r'

(Dimension 1 × 1)

(2')

Equation (2') permits us to examine the data by factor and by region, whereas equation (2) pools
together all of the factor evidence for any regional comparison. This is an important advantage,
because if equation (2') holds for some factors but not others, then tests based on equation (2)
might fail to detect failures in the theory for particular factors. This would occur if negative
values on the left-hand side of equation (2') were eliminated in being summed together with one
or more positive values.
How does one test a relationship like (2')? Since there are FR2 relationships, it makes
sense to try to place some structure on the results to make them more interpretable. As we noted
above, for each factor f, we can arrange the results from each pairwise comparison generated by
the left-hand side of equation (2') into a symmetric R × R matrix, PVXf . Similarly, employing this
procedure for the right-hand side generates the symmetric R × R matrix, AVVf . We are left with F
pairs of matrices, one pair for each factor f, as shown below:

11
PVX = A VV
f

f

(Dimension R × R)

(3)

As with the aggregate matrices described above, these factor-specific matrices are symmetric and
have zeroes along the diagonal. Moreover, the off-diagonal elements should be non-negative.
There are two types of tests we can conduct on these pairs of matrices. First are sign
f
tests, which entail verifying that the off-diagonal elements of PVX are all non-negative. (Those of
f

AVV are necessarily so.) Sign tests tell us whether prefectures that are relatively more endowed

with a given factor tend, on average, to produce larger quantities of commodities that use that
factor intensively.

Unfortunately, sign tests are problematic as a test of the relationship in

equation (3) because they are insensitive to magnitudes. For example, if prefectures are very
similar in their endowments but there exists some measurement error, the sign test may fail even
though BX may actually be very close to V in most instances.
To remedy this potential drawback and to bolster our analysis, we also conduct correlation
tests. For each factor f, we can make R(R – 1)/2 pairwise comparisons between the elements
comprising the symmetric matrices on the left- and right-hand sides of equation (3). The rank or
raw correlation of these R(R – 1)/2 elements—what we call “within-factor” tests—indicate
whether large differences in regional endowments of a given factor are reflected in large
differences in outputs. Unfortunately, both the sign and within-factor correlation tests share the
same problem inherent in tests of equation (1') outlined above: namely, success in these tests
might arise simply from size variation across regions, rather than reflecting differences in factor
proportions.

Fortunately, we can control for the possible confounding effect of size by

conducting “cross-factor” tests.

For each pair of regions (r, r'), equation (2') gives us F

comparisons of relative factor abundance and relative factor usage. By conducting rank and raw
correlations of these F × 1 vectors, we can determine if differences in relative factor abundances
are reflected in corresponding relative outputs.
In sum, success on this battery of tests indicates that a set of regions has identical or nearly
identical production techniques, whereas failure indicates that there must be substantial regional
variation in unit input requirements. These tests of the HOV production model also serve as a

12
critical controlled experiment that we can draw upon in subsequent tests of the FED model. If all
regions use identical production techniques, then we know that our inability to predict output on
the basis of factor endowments cannot be the result of increasing returns, technological
differences, fewer goods than factors, or any other reason that might cause factor-price
equalization to fail. As we argue in the next section, this significantly reduces the possible causes
of problems with the FED model.

B. Predicting Outputs From Factor Endowments
1. Theory
A major question in international trade is whether production levels and trade flows are
determined by factor endowments. In this section we explore the conditions under which the
Heckscher-Ohlin model guarantees such a relationship. Ultimately, we would like to write output
as a linear function of factor endowments, i.e.
Xr = ΩVr

(Dimension F × 1)

(4)

where the Ω matrix has dimension N × F. Equation (4) is what we call the factor-endowmentsdriven (FED) model of production. In general, output can be written as a unique function of
endowments, that is independent of the endowments, only if N ≤ F. Furthermore there will be a
common technology matrix B such that BXr = Vr ∀ r ∈ R only if there is factor price equalization,
which in turn requires that N ≥ F. Hence a necessary condition for both relations holding is that
there are an equal number of goods and factors.
An alternative way about thinking about the problem is that if BXr = Vr, then a unique Ω
will exist only if B is invertible. Invertibility in turn requires that B is of full rank and that there
are an equal number of goods and factors; and in this case, Ω equals B-1.
Notice that we have just derived a test of whether there are an equal number of goods and
factors. If the HOV model of production works and B has full rank, then the FED model of
production will fail if there are more goods than factors. To demonstrate this, consider what
happens if N < F. If N < F, country endowments are not scalar multiples of each other, and there

13
is no international factor mobility, then factor price equalization will not obtain in general, and the
HOV model of production will be violated.12 In a one-good, two-factor model, for example,
there is no linear relationship between endowments and output that is the same for all regions. On
the other hand, if N > F and the other conditions of the model are satisfied, the HOV model of
production should apply: i.e., all regions will use identical production techniques. However, the
equilibrium output vectors are no longer unique, B is not invertible, and there is no one-for-one
mapping from endowments into production as postulated in (4). Thus, if there are more goods
than factors we should expect equations (1') and (2') to hold but equation (4) to fail.13 This
simple test based on the invertibility of B serves as our main mechanism for identifying if there are
more goods than factors.
How do we assess a failure of equation (4)? Once again we are going to evaluate the
success of the model by focusing on percentage prediction errors. Specifically we examine the
) n r nr
)n
magnitudes of Ω V X − 1 , where Ω is our estimate of the nth row of the Ω matrix and Xnr
the nth element of Xr. As in our tests of equation (1'), we generate average prediction errors
across prefectures and across industries.
We also implement a second test, making use of the fact that somewhat more structure
can be placed on the Ω matrix. Premultiplying equation (4) by B, we obtain BX = BΩV.
Assuming that equation (1) holds, we can then substitute for BX to yield:
V = BΩV

12

⇒

BΩ = I

(Dimension F × F)

(5)

Technically, in a world with N < F and factor mobility, factors might migrate so that FPE obtains.
Then both the HOV and FED models of production would hold, and we would not be able to distinguish between a
world in which there are equal numbers of goods and factors and one in which there are fewer goods than factors.
However, with fewer goods than factors, we would still not expect to see equation (1) hold and equation (4) fail.
13Net trade in factor services, by contrast, will remain determinate even in a world where N exceeds M.
In other words, the HOV trade equation remains valid. Using r to denote a country, W to denote the world, sr to
denote country r's share of world spending, and T to denote trade, this can be formulated mathematically as BTr =
Vr - srVW. Thus our results have no bearing on the studies which attempt to measure how well the HOV trade
equation fits the empirical data.
In fact, there is a growing empirical literature on the predictive power of the HOV trade equation, and so
far the reviews are mixed. Early studies, such as Maskus (1985) and Bowen, Leamer, and Sveikauskas (1987),
unanimously found the model to be an empirical failure. Later studies offer a somewhat more equivocal
assessment. Papers by Trefler (1993, 1995) and Davis, Weinstein et al. (1997) have shown that when modified in
minor ways the HOV model has considerable explanatory power.

14
where I is an F × F identity matrix.14 Similarly, it is possible to write
X = ΩBX

⇒

ΩB = I

(Dimension N × N)

(6)

Now I is an N × N identity matrix. In a world where N exceeds F, equation (6) will never be
satisfied because it imposes N2 linear restrictions on only NF parameters. We therefore test only
equation (5) to see if the estimated parameters of the Ω matrix are weakly related to the
underlying technology by imposing F2 restrictions on NF parameters.
Theory tells us that we should expect to see three possible outcomes from these
experiments. If both the HOV and the FED models work, then we can conclude that endowments
do determine the location of production. Similarly, if both models fail, then we can conclude that
the world must violate a fundamental tenet of the HOV framework. The final possibility, that
HOV works but the FED fails, indicates that the basic assumptions of the HOV model hold, but
there are more goods than factors.
There are two different ways in which having more goods than factors can affect our
results. First, it may be the case that there truly are fewer factors than goods. Second, it may be
that we simply have omitted some important factors from our production specification. To see
why this might matter, suppose that we are in a two-good, two-factor model but have data on
only one factor. If one has the row of the B matrix corresponding to that factor and all the other
conditions of the model are satisfied, then the HOV model would hold even with an omitted
factor. On the other hand, it would not be possible to predict production structure without the
missing factor. Since we do have not a complete list of potential factors, we must be open to the
possibility that some factor endowments are not included in our analysis. Hence, if we find that
equation (4) fails, our analysis must address the question of whether there are truly more goods
than factors, or whether we have inadvertently omitted important factors. We will return to this
issue in the empirical implementation.

14One

could easily think of some particular vectors V for which the inference in equation (4) is not strictly
correct, because there are matrices other than I for which the first equation holds. However, since this relationship
has to hold for any V, the only possible solution is BΩ = I.

15
C. Trade Cost Tests
Thus far, we have considered tests within the context of the success or failure of the HOV
and FED models of production. A complementary approach asks what conditions will serve to
eliminate production indeterminacy arising from the existence of more goods than factors.
One potential solution is to aggregate goods in such a way that N = F. It turns out,
however, that aggregation solves the indeterminacy problem only in exceptional cases.15 One
such stylized situation involves the existence of two factors and three goods (autos, brown shoes,
and black shoes), with two goods (the shoe varieties) produced using identical techniques. In this
case, it is not possible to predict how much of each type of shoe will be produced, but one could
predict production of autos and total shoes by aggregating the two types of shoes. This kind of
degenerate case is, of course, highly unlikely to prevail in practice. Particularly in our sample,
where industries are defined at a relatively high degree of aggregation, the odds of any two
industries employing exactly the same production techniques are remote, at best.16 Aside from
these uninteresting and very implausible scenarios, the literature addressing the problem has
typically concluded that aggregation does not offer a viable way of obtaining mappings from
factor endowments into production, when N > F.17

15Of

course, the B matrix provides a trivial set of weights for aggregating sectors, but weighting the
outputs by their unit factor requirements reduces the FED model of production to a restatement of the HOV model.
16 Indeed, we can and did check for this possibility by verifying that no two columns in the B matrix were
identical.
17Leamer (1984) attempts to use aggregation to address the indeterminacy problem, forming commodity
aggregates based on how production is correlated. However, this procedure biases the results in favor of fitting the
model, as it uses information on the pattern of production to predict the pattern of production.
More generally, it can be demonstrated that it is impossible to aggregate while maintaining reasonable
industry definitions. Our analysis, which parallels Chang (1979) and Leamer (1994), runs as follows. Suppose
that no two goods are produced with the same technology so that we are not in a degenerate case. Then arbitrarily
choose a set of F goods, X1, and separate the technology matrix into B1, an FxF matrix corresponding to X1, and
B2, a matrix of dimension Mx(N-F). The HOV production equation is now B1X1 + B2X2 = V. Since B1 is
invertible, this can be written as
X* = X1 + B1-1B2X2 = B1-1V.
X* is a set of F aggregated goods, but one cannot give this aggregate an interpretation since every element
will be a linear combination (with, in general, some negative weights) of N - F + 1 goods. Furthermore, even if
one tried to forge ahead by regressing X1 on V and treating B1-1B2X2 as part of the error term, the fact that X2 is
correlated with V means that one’s estimates of B1-1 will be biased and inconsistent.

16

A more promising candidate for eliminating indeterminacy, suggested by Leamer (1984),
is trade costs: i.e., all transactions costs, including but not limited to transportation and
information costs, entailed in exchanging a commodity across geographical boundaries.18 If trade
flows minimize trade costs subject to the constraint that they satisfy the HOV trade equation,
there may exist a linear relationship between factor endowments and trade (and hence production)
patterns. For example, one can obtain such a relation by solving the following minimization
problem
min
∑ κT
r

r

T

s. t. BT r = V r − s rV W ∀r
where κ is a vector of trade costs, Tr a vector of net trade flows for country r, Vr country r’s
endowment vector, sr country r's share in global consumption, and VW the world endowment
vector.
One problem with Leamer’s approach is that it does not guarantee that the solution to the
trade cost minimization problem will also cause goods markets to clear. For example, if the most
capital and labor-intensive goods are traded costlessly but are only demanded in very small
quantities in equilibrium, then the solution to the minimization problem will not be the solution to
the general-equilibrium problem. Furthermore, as Anderson (1988) notes, Leamer’s results are
highly contingent on the functional form of trade costs. Leamer also implicitly assumes that
international trade costs, which could drive a wedge between domestic and foreign prices, do not
affect unit input requirements or consumer demands.
Although it is possible to identify theoretical problems with Leamer’s approach, it is not
hard to construct cases where his approach works nicely. In Figure 1 we present a model where
there are two countries, three goods, and two factors (K and L). The countries’ endowments are
denoted by E, and their consumption points by C. If there are no trade costs, the factor-price

18Leamer

actually frames the argument in terms of transportation costs, but it is more appropriate to think
of these costs as international transactions costs, since distance does not enter the analysis. This framing of the
issue is supported by McCallum's (1995) finding that Canadian provinces trade with each other 20 times more than
they do with U.S. states located similar distances away.

17

equalization (FPE) set is described by the hexagonal region. Trade here is indeterminate, as there
are an infinite number of ways that production can be divided between the two countries.
Suppose, however, that good 1 is traded at some cost. In this case the FPE set collapses as
shown in Figure 2. Output of good 1 in each country (indicated by the length of the stems from
the origin) is determined by the relative income levels at home and abroad.

Once this is

determined, the factor content of trade must be accomplished solely via the exchange of goods 2
and 3. In this manner, it is possible for trade costs to render production patterns determinate
without upsetting FPE. This solution will only work in the case in which the number of goods
traded at cost exactly equals N - F. If fewer goods are subject to trade costs, then we obtain the
result portrayed in Figure 3. Here there are two factors and four goods, only one of which (good
1) cannot be traded costlessly. Each region consumes and produces good 1 in proportion to its
income share, but output of the other goods is indeterminate. Hence, with many more goods than
factors, identical production techniques across regions (i.e., the HOV production model works),
and trade costs on certain goods, then endowments should still be able to predict the output of
non-tradable goods sectors, even if the FED model fails for tradable industries.
The above framework always features some nontraded goods, when in reality most
commodities are traded at some cost. Hence we should also develop the theory for cases in
which trade costs are ubiquitous. While it would take us too far afield to develop the topic fully,
we would at least like to provide a heuristic account, based on the analysis of Xu (1993), of how
trade costs could help to eliminate the production indeterminacy.19
Consider a Heckscher-Ohlin world with two countries whose endowments are not too
dissimilar, two factors (capital and labor), and a continuum of industries indexed by z ∈ [0,1].20
Each industry z has a continuum of goods indexed by j ∈ [z, 1 + z]. We assume that j is a direct
measure of the capital intensity of the good. We also assume that all goods have Samuelson

19Xu’s

model is actually more general than the one given below, as it incorporates differences in both
factor abundances and technology. However, the essence of the model is captured in the version we present.
20 We wish to thank Donald Davis for providing us with a clear and elegant explication of this point.

18

iceberg trade costs, so that if t > 1 units of a good are shipped, only 1 unit arrives. Suppose that
the home country is more capital abundant than the foreign country and that initially trade costs
are prohibitive. In this case the return to capital will be lower in the home country than in the
foreign country. Now consider what happens if trade costs fall sufficiently to allow for trade.
With lower trade costs, the home country will have a comparative advantage in the most capitalintensive goods due to the fact that capital is cheaper at home than abroad. Similarly, lower
foreign wages will cause the foreign country to export the most labor-intensive goods. Goods of
intermediate capital intensity will not be traded because the cost advantage in neither country will
exceed the trade costs. In the limit as trade costs go to zero, FPE will obtain, and the range of
non-traded goods will fall.
This structure suffices to make both production and trade determinate. There is a range of
goods [0, j*] produced in and exported from only the foreign country. Likewise, there is a range
of goods [j’, 2] produced in and exported from only the home country. All goods in the range [j*,
j’] are not traded in equilibrium, so each country produces these goods according to its own
needs. The determination of the boundaries, j* and j’, depends inter alia on the magnitude of
trade costs, the equilibrium level of demand for the various goods, and the extent of differences in
the countries’ endowments. Note that although there is complete specialization in all goods
traded in equilibrium, this need not suggest any specialization in the industrial aggregates (hence
in real-world data), since each industry incorporates goods with a range of factor intensities.
Nevertheless, one can sensibly talk about the typical factor intensity of an industry, and it will
generally be the case that exports are higher for more capital-intensive industries in the capitalabundant country (and vice versa for the labor-abundant country).21
The upshot of this analysis is that trade costs may represent an important mechanism for
generating production determinacy within the Heckscher-Ohlin framework. Indeed, in a world
with trade costs and more goods than factors, one should expect two results. First, factor

21

It is worth noting that the relationship is not necessarily linear.

19

endowments should provide more accurate predictions of output for non-tradables than for traded
goods if the latter are traded freely. Second, assuming that trade costs are more significant at the
international level, but do not disturb FPE significantly, then the FED model should fit better on
the international data set, ceteris paribus. 22 We now turn to testing these propositions.

IV. Data Description
This paper makes use of two data sets. The first is a slightly modified version of the data
set constructed in Davis, Weinstein et al. (1997). We obtained our technology matrix, B, from
that paper, but augmented the regional data so that we had information on 47 Japanese
prefectures rather than ten Japanese regions.

The data appendix provides details on the

construction of our data set. Summary statistics are provided in Table 1. As one can see there is
a large amount of regional variation in endowments due in part to the tremendous size variation of
Japanese prefectures.
The second data set we use is an international data set on endowments and industry sales
at the ISIC three digit level of 22 OECD countries. Details on the construction of this data set
are also discussed in the data appendix. As one might expect, there is greater dispersion in output
(as measured by GDP) and endowments in the international data than in the regional. However,
the difference is not as large as one might suspect. Typically the coefficient of variation is only
about twice as large for the international data set as for the regional data.
More interesting is the evidence on the dispersion of industries at the regional level.
Tables 2 through 4 present coefficients of variation calculated in two ways. First, we hold each
industry fixed and calculate a coefficient of variation using region and country based variation of
given industries. This type of dispersion is quite sensitive to the size distribution of regions and
countries. Not surprisingly, the data reveals that there is about twice as much dispersion in
22The

qualification “ceteris paribus” is necessary because international data is likely to differ from
regional data in dimensions other than trade costs. Indeed, as we discuss below, some of these differences (e.g.,
dissimilar production techniques across countries and larger measurement errors on international data) are likely to
work in the opposite direction, impairing the performance of the FED model at the international level.

20

international sales than in regional output. Most of this is due to two large outliers, the US and
New Zealand. If we hold countries or regions fixed and examine how much variation there is
across different industries, we can obtain some sense of whether industries are more specialized
on regional or international data. Krugman (1991) found that there was greater regional
dispersion of industries in the US than in Europe. Comparing Tables 2 and 4 we find similar
evidence for Japan vis-à-vis the OECD. There is far more specialization among Japanese regions
than among countries. This is what one might expect if trade costs are higher for international
than for interregional trade. We now turn to investigating the implications of this hypothesis more
systematically in the next section.

V. Results
The box below summarizes the theoretical implications of production indeterminacy. As
we mentioned above, we will use both regional and international data to test the theory. The use
of regional data is important because it provides us with a data set in the HOV model of
production is satisfied. This enables us to establish that failures in the FED model of production
are not the result of differences in production techniques. Furthermore, the regional data also
allow us to examine whether the FED model performs differently for tradables, which are traded
relatively freely, than for non-tradables, which are traded at substantial cost. Next we turn to
international data in which trade costs are presumably more pervasive and quantitatively
significant than for tradables in the regional sample. Here we examine the theoretical prediction
that the FED model of production yields more accurate forecasts in the presence of trade costs.

21

Implications of Production Indeterminacy
Suppose the HOV production model holds. Then N ≥ F, leaving two possible scenarios:
If N = F and B has full rank, then Ω = B-1. Both the HOV and FED production models hold,
meaning:
BX = V
and
X = ΩV
BΩ = I
and ΩB = I
If N > F, then the HOV model holds but the FED model does not. This implies:
BX = V
but
X T ≠ Ω ΤV
for goods traded at no cost*

and X = Ω V for non-tradables or goods subject to trade costs
ΩB ≠ I
and
BΩ ≠ I

A. The HOV Model of Production: Tests of Equations (1') and (2') on Regional Data
We begin our analysis by verifying that the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek model of production
is valid for our sample of Japanese regions. In particular, we confirm that BX = V, or that each
region employs the same production techniques (Br = B ∀r ∈ R). As we mentioned earlier, this
relationship could fail to hold as a result of increasing returns, Ricardian technical differences
across regions, fewer goods than factors, or any other reason that would cause factor price
equalization to fail. In this sense, our test is similar in spirit to that used by Davis, Weinstein et al.
(1997), with one difference. In that paper, it was crucial that households consumed in the same
regions in which they produced, so regional trade vectors could be constructed. Since the
consumption theory is irrelevant for our tests of the Rybczynski theorem, however, it is not
essential that all workers in each prefecture conduct their consumption in that location. We need
simply to have accurate production and factor endowment data for each prefecture. This enables
us to use data from all 47 Japanese prefectures as opposed to the 10 aggregated regions used by
Davis, Weinstein et al. Our X vector contained data on gross output for 29 sectors for each

22
prefecture, and our V vector included three factors: workers with less than a college education,
college-educated workers, and capital. 23
Table 5 presents the average prediction errors of the HOV model of production. The
prediction errors are generally quite small, averaging 13% across all observations (where each
observation is prefecture-factor specific). As explained earlier, we also calculate average errors
over each prefecture and over each factor. There are few outliers among the prefectures; only
three have average errors in excess of 25%, and none has an average error greater than 33%.
Among the factors, the model works best for capital and worst for non-college-educated labor.
Figures 4 and 5 present plots of the predicted and actual factor endowments for each
prefecture. Since we do not want differences in prefectural size to affect our results, each
observation is deflated by the total amount of the corresponding factor for Japan and also in
Figure 5 by the square root of the region’s GDP. The graphical evidence confirms our basic
intuition from Table 1. To the extent that economies of scale or technological differences exist,
they are not significant enough to invalidate the HOV production predictions. This evidence
corroborates the findings of Davis, Weinstein et al. (1997) for more aggregated regions in Japan:
production techniques are (approximately) identical across Japanese prefectures, and the HOV
model of production performs very well in areas where it is reasonable to assume factor price
equalization.
We also conduct the sign and correlation tests suggested by Ethier. Recall that the sign
test entails an examination of the off-diagonal elements of the three matrices (one for each factor)
corresponding to the left-hand side of equation (3). According to theory, the R(R-1)/2 offdiagonal elements, which for our sample involves 1,081 possible pairwise comparisons of different
prefectures for each factor, should all be non-negative. Once again, this is a test of whether
prefectures that are relatively more endowed with a given factor tend to produce larger quantities
of products that use that factor intensively.

23See

the Data Appendix for information on how the sample was constructed.

23
The results from these sign tests are presented in Table 6. Of the 3,243 possible sign
checks, only 5.2% (168) were negative. Without a well-specified null, it is difficult to say whether
predicting 95% of the signs correctly is good or bad. In order to get a sense of how a random
mix of output and endowment vectors would perform, we randomly assigned actual endowment
vectors to actual output vectors and reran the tests. These simulated results revealed that if
outputs and endowments were independently distributed, slightly more than 50% of the signs
were negative. While this experiment enables us to reject the hypothesis that the real data were
generated by a coin flip, it is unfortunately not a very meaningful test, since no one believes that
output and endowments are completely uncorrelated. However, based on the sign test, it seems
reasonable to conclude that regions more endowed with a particular factor generally produce
more outputs intensive in that factor. In this sense, the data corroborate Ethier’s Rybczynski
“correlation.”
Our second test of Ethier’s multidimensional Rybczynski formulation uses the correlations
between the elements comprising the matrices on the left- and right-hand sides of equation (3).
First, we conduct “within-factor” tests, holding f constant and examining the variation across
prefectures in the endowment and utilization of a given factor. The results of this experiment are
reported in the second panel of Table 6. The rank and raw correlations exceed 0.95, indicating
that differences in production structures across prefectures are very tightly linked with differences
in factor endowments, in a manner consistent with theory. Of course, it is possible that this result
is being driven by size differences rather than differences in relative factor endowments.
To eliminate the possibly confounding influence of size-based variation, we also conduct
“cross-factor” tests. Here we hold constant the prefecture pair and examine correlations between
the measured and actual absorption of factors. In effect, this test tells us whether relative factor
abundances translate into relative differences in production structure, in accordance with the HOV
production model. The bottom panel of Table 2 reports the cross-factor correlations. The
average raw correlation (averaged across all 1,081 prefecture pairs) was 0.84, and the average
rank correlation was 0.78. Though somewhat lower than the within-factor correlations, these

24
results still manifest a close connection between outputs and factor endowments as posited by the
HOV production model. We believe that this is the first empirical verification of the Ethier’s
multidimensional Rybczynski “correlation.”

B. Assuming the Even Case: Tests of Equations (4) and (5) for Regional Data
Thus far we have established that the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek production model describes
the regional data quite well. However, the links between endowments and production that we
have explored so far have been “correlations” that one can derive from the assumptions of the
HOV model. The question examined in this section is whether the data support a stronger
relationship between factor endowments and production. In particular, is there a linear, one-toone functional relationship between factor endowments and outputs, or are “correlations”
between these two variables the most that we can expect to obtain? As noted earlier, this
amounts to asking whether there are an equal number of goods and factors.
To examine this question, we regressed output on factor endowments. Before discussing
the results, we need to address three minor econometric issues. First, our dependent variable is
truncated at zero, and even though only nine observations were zeros, we decided to use a Tobit
procedure to correct for a bias in these industries.24 Second, larger regions are likely to have
larger errors, so it is important to correct for heteroskedasticity. Following much of the literature,
we deflated all observations by the square root of prefectural GDP.25 Third is the issue of
whether to include a constant term. In a model with equal numbers of goods and factors, a
constant would not be necessary unless the error did not have a mean of zero. If we assume that
the error incorporates omitted factors, then there is good reason for not forcing the error term to
have a mean of zero. In a world with more goods than factors, the equation is misspecified with
or without the constant. Since there seemed to be good arguments both for including and

24The

industries with zeros in them were rubber, leather, and non-ferrous metals.
an alternative specification we adjusted for heteroskedasticity using endogenous weights, where the
weights were chosen by assuming that the variance of the error term is proportional to GDP raised to some power.
The results were qualitatively similar to those obtained using the square root of GDP as the weight.
25In

25
excluding the constant, we ran the model both ways. We report only the results from the
regressions with a constant, because the results without the constant were similar although the fits
were somewhat worse.
The results of regressing X on V are presented in Table 7. We report standard errors to
indicate the precision of the point estimates. It is often the case that one or more of the
coefficients is statistically significant and in almost all specifications we can reject the hypothesis
of zero slopes. It is important to recognize, however, that without an alternative hypothesis we
cannot provide an interpretation of a coefficient that is statistically different from zero. As long as
BX = V, output and factor endowments will be correlated, as Ethier has demonstrated
theoretically and we have verified empirically. However, this does not imply that X is a wellbehaved function of V.
In Table 8, prediction errors are expressed as percentages of the actual values.26 We have
calculated average deviations for each prefecture (across all industries) and for each industry
(across all prefectures). Strikingly, the average error is more than an order of magnitude larger
than that obtained when we compared BX and V. The typical error exceeds 300%—almost 25
times larger than the 13% average prediction error for factor endowments shown in Table 1.
What makes this enormous discrepancy even more astonishing is the fact that our B matrix is
given as data, while our Ω matrix was estimated in a way designed to minimize the residuals.27
Figure 6 plots predicted and actual output levels. Output in every sector has been divided
by the total Japanese amount in that sector, so all points are distributed between zero and one.
The plots reveal several interesting features of the data that are harder to see in Tables 7 and 8.

26We

dropped the nine observations with zero reported output, for which this measure is undefined. We
also acknowledge a potential problem with this measure: it may generate exceptionally large errors for observations
in which actual production is close to zero and predicted production is negative. Although this possibility exists, it
does not explain why we obtain such large average errors. Relatively few points (nineteen in Figure 5, three in
Figure 6) fall into this category, and the average error for these observations is 348%, which is not much larger
than the average error for the entire sample.
27We also tried regressing V on X. In general, this produced tighter fits than those obtained from using
the Japanese technology matrix and almost all coefficients could not be statistically distinguished from the values
of the B matrix. Unfortunately with 30 parameters to estimate (29 coefficients plus a constant) and only 47 data
points, the standard errors were quite large. Since our tests had very little power, we decided not report the results.

26
First, there is a lot more variance in the distribution of normalized output than in the distribution
of normalized factor endowments. Indeed, the median variance of normalized output is 17 times
larger than the median variance of normalized endowments.

Second, there are many more

extreme outliers in the production data than in the factor endowment data.

The average

maximum value in the production data was eleven times larger than the median value, while the
maximum/median ratio for the endowment data was only about two. One possible reason for this
difference in variances is the existence of Jones magnification effects. Alternatively, far greater
variation in production patterns than in factor endowments is also consistent with production
indeterminacy. Whatever the reason for these extreme outliers in virtually every industry, their
existence means that the R2’s tend to overstate the ability of regressions to fit the typical point.28
We care not only about the accuracy of the model, but also about the interpretation of the
coefficients. We argued previously that if BX = V (as in our data set) and if X = ΩV, then it must
be the case that BΩ = I. In other words, if there is a one-to-one relationship between factor
endowments and outputs, then there should be a relationship between input requirements (the
elements of B) and the coefficients obtained by regressing output on factor endowments. In order
to test whether our coefficients are capturing the underlying technology, we regressed output on
factor endowments and imposed the nine linear constraints implied by the relationship BΩ = I.
The appropriate test uses the Wald criterion, which has a χ2 distribution with nine degrees of
freedom.

We used two estimating methods, iterative and non-iterative seemingly-unrelated

regression. The critical value (1% level) of the Wald statistic was 22, but we obtained 1403 and
1053, for the iterative and non-iterative tests, respectively. The data clearly reject the hypothesis
that our estimated coefficients are actually Rybczynski derivatives, since they are not related to
technology in the manner required by theory.
Thus, our results using regional data demonstrate that the FED model fails to hold. Why
is this so?
28One

Since previous studies have used international data, they have been unable to

approach to dealing with these outliers is to use an estimator obtained by minimizing absolute
deviations. We reran our tests using a minimum absolute deviations estimator, but the results remained
qualitatively similar.

27
distinguish among the many potential reasons that the FED model of production might fail.
However, BX = V in our regional data, so we can eliminate virtually all of the problems that made
Harrigan's (1995) results difficult to interpret. Technological differences (e.g., increasing returns),
lumpy regions, regional industrial policy, or any other reason that might cause factor price
equalization to fail within Japan would cause both BX = V and X = ΩV to fail.29 Similarly, if
there were fewer goods than factors, we would either have found both relationships failing or,
with factor mobility, both working. Since the first relationship holds and the second does not,
either the B matrix is not invertible due to the existence of more goods than factors, or our
analysis has omitted some important factors.

C. Missing Factors
Since it is impossible to be certain that all relevant factors have been included, there is no
way to prove that the structure of production is indeterminate.30 For example, college graduates
who studied engineering may represent a different type of labor than those who majored in
English. Indeed, every individual may constitute a different factor. However, there is a danger in
using factors that are excessively disaggregated, since they may generate tautologically true
relations between, say, agricultural workers and agricultural output. Moreover, if our tests fail
because of the unavailability of data on finely specified factors, then the theory itself is ultimately
not very useful, since researchers do not have access to this type of information in practice. We
therefore focus on the set of factors that can be found in national or international data sets to see
if these additional variables can improve the fit of the FED model.31
29See

Courant and Deardorff (1992) for a discussion of problems arising from lumpiness.
is related to the more general problem of determining what are economically meaningful factors
and goods. As Melvin (1968, p. 1265) and Leamer and Levinsohn (1995, p. 1363) acknowledge, we have not
made much progress toward answering this fundamental question.
31One possible approach to searching for omitted factors is to test if the residuals have a factor analytic
structure. The idea being that if there were omitted factors, they might turn up in the residuals. At the suggestion
of a referee we conducted principal components analysis of the residuals. This did uncover a variety of correlations
between residuals across sectors. Unfortunately, it is difficult to interpret these results. The problem with this
approach can be seen by contemplating a three-good, two-factor model. While this is a classic case of
indeterminacy the aggregate resource constraint will impose a clear structure on the residuals. If one region has
low output in sectors one and three then output in sector two must be high and vice versa. Hence correlations
30This

28
Previous studies using international data suggest that additional factors (for which we can
obtain measures) are unlikely to provide great improvements of the fits of cross-sectional
regressions of trade on factor endowments. For example, when Leamer (1988b) looked at the
question of how many factors should be included in a model predicting international trade flows
on the basis of factor endowments, he found that he could reject models using more than nine (out
of eleven potential) factors. Many of the factors that Leamer considered potentially relevant for
international trade, such as illiterate workers, tropical land, desert land, coal production, oil and
gas production, and mineral production are either non-existent in Japan or exist only in extremely
small amounts.

Consequently, it is doubtful that these factors significantly affect Japanese

production.32 Even before we begin the search for missing factors, then, there is reason to be
skeptical that adding more factors will greatly improve the fits.
The most obvious missing factor is land. In principle, we could have used eight different
land factors, but since many of the land categories just represent different types of fields or
construction, we decided to use two aggregated land variables. The first category was usable
urban and farm land, and the second consisted of undeveloped mountain and forest land. To
consider the effects of using finer measures of human capital, we also decomposed our two
measures of labor endowments into four educational classes: 4-year college and above, 2-year
college, high school, and less than high school.
We considered three specifications: (1) the basic three-factor model, with unskilled labor,
skilled labor, and capital; (2) a five-factor model, with the original three factors plus two types of
land; and (3) a seven-factor model, with four categories of labor, two land variables, and capital.
Prediction errors and R2’s for the last two specifications are presented in Tables 9a and
9b. (Complete regression results are reported in Table A1 and A2 of the Results Appendix.)
Overall, there is some improvement in the adjusted R2's of the regressions, especially in land-

among residuals will quite naturally occur even in the absence of omitted factors. Thus, while factor analysis
shows finds some correlation our residuals, we are hesitant to interpret this as evidence in favor of omitted factors.
32Japan has no deserts or tropical land. Leamer (1984) reports that less than 1% of the labor force is
illiterate in Japan. Furthermore, only 0.1% of the labor force is employed in mining.

29
intensive sectors like agriculture. However, the average prediction errors do not improve. Even
after incorporating additional factors, the FED production model yields prediction errors that are
around 25 times larger than those obtained from the HOV model of production. Thus, additional
factors do not contribute to the predictive power of the FED production model.
Through statistical tests, we can determine more formally the optimal number of factors.
In particular, we followed Bowen et al. (1987), Leamer (1988b), and Trefler (1995) in applying
the Schwartz criterion:
log(Li) - p/2*log(n)
where Li is the maximized likelihood under hypothesis i, p is the number of parameters and n is
the number of observations. The preferred specification is the one with the largest Schwartz
criterion. The Schwartz criterion has a number of inherent advantages: it is derivable from
Bayesian principles, it performs well in Monte Carlo studies, and it asymptotically identifies the
correct model with probability one.33
Table 6 shows that the basic three-factor model is the preferred specification, as evaluated
by the Schwartz criterion. Combined with the fact that equation-by-equation estimation using
more factors did not produce better estimates of production, this evidence suggests that missing
factors (at least those for which we can obtain data) cannot explain the poor fit of the FED
production model. We conclude that production indeterminacy is a major problem for this data
sample.

referee made the useful suggestion that we employ the likelihood ratio test. By this standard, the
seven-factor model performs best, with a test statistic of χ2[116] = 270 (p-value = 0.000) relative to the three-factor
model, and χ2[58] = 126 (p-value = 0.000) relative to the five-factor model. This divergence between the results
obtrained from the likelihood ratio test and those from the Schwartz criterion is not unusual. Indeed, the authors
of Bowen et al. (1987), Leamer (1988b), and Trefler (1995) would have all chosen more highly parameterized
specifications had they used the likelihood ratio test rather than the Schwartz criterion. These discrepancies arise
from the fact that the two procedures answer different questions. The likelihood ratio test gives the probability of
finding points where our data are, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. By contrast, the Schwartz criterion
takes the data distribution as given and asks which model specification best describes the data. Our analysis is
more concerned with the latter question.

D. Trade Costs and Indeterminacy
We argued earlier that trade costs may help resolve production indeterminacy arising from
the existence of more goods than factors. This provides us with two additional ways to analyze
the data. First, we examine whether there are any differences between the performance of the
FED model across tradable and non-tradable sectors in the regional data. Then we employ the
same battery of tests used earlier on an international data set, where trade costs are likely to be
ubiquitous, and compare the results with those obtained previously on regional data.

1. Trade Costs and Regional Data
Figure 3 demonstrates that in a data set where the number of traded goods exceeds the
number of factors and in which certain sectors are traded at cost while other sectors are freely
traded, the FED model should work for non-traded goods but not for tradables. This is precisely
what we see in the regional data. The average prediction error for non-tradable sectors is only
20%, which is quite close in magnitude to the 13% average error obtained from tests of the HOV
model of production. By contrast, the average prediction error for manufactures exceeds 400%,
or 20 times that for non-tradables. This huge divergence is consistent with a world in which trade
costs partially alleviate the production indeterminacy arising from the existence of more goods
than factors.

2. Testing the HOV Model on International Data
We now examine how our results change when we apply the same tests used on Japanese
prefectural data to cross-country data. There are two principal differences between the two types
of data. First, technology differences, measurement errors, and other problems are likely to
plague the HOV framework when applying it to international as opposed to regional data. Most
of these problems are likely to generate worse fits for both the HOV and the FED models of
production.

The second important difference, higher trade costs at the international level, has

differential effects on the two models. To the extent that trade costs mitigate indeterminacy, the

31
FED model may perform better on international than on regional data, even if the HOV model
fails at the international level. Whether this is actually the case is an empirical question to which
we now turn.
We begin by first examining how well the HOV model of production describes the
international data. In Table 11, we calculate the average percentage deviations between BX and
V for international data, just as we did for the regional sample in Table 5.34 The fit of the HOV
model is far worse at the international level. The average prediction error (|BX - V|/V) is 81% for
international data, or about six times larger than the 13% obtained using regional data.35 Notice
that even the smallest error for the cross-country sample (22% for Finland) exceeds the average
error for the regional data.
Reinforcing this point are the results obtained from running the Rybczynski “correlation”
tests on the international data. Of course, given that BX ≠ V, there is no sound theoretical
foundation for performing these tests at the international level. However, when juxtaposed with
the regional results, the international results provide a useful indication of the tests’ explanatory
power. Table 12 shows that the multidimensional Rybczynski “correlation” performs relatively
poorly at the international level. Of the 570 possible sign checks, 154 elements (27%) have the
wrong sign, compared to only 5% in the tests using prefectural data. In general, the within-factor
correlations are far lower than the extremely high values obtained for Japanese regions. More
significantly, when we eliminate the influence of size by conducting cross-factor correlations, we
obtain values approximating 0.35 rather than the 0.81 obtained using regional data. At the
international level, there is not the tight link between technology, factor endowments, and outputs
predicted by the HOV model and prevailing at the regional level. This tends to support the
growing literature that suggests that there exist important differences in international production
techniques.

34We

could not include Japan in our sample since it would fit by construction.
In an earlier draft, we reported a higher number for a sample that included the Netherlands. This was
due to an incompatibility of the Netherlands data with the rest of the sample. We therefore have deleted the
Netherlands from the sample.
35

3. Testing the FED Model on International Data
We next examine the FED model using a cross-section of countries. Having established
that our sample of countries does not use identical production techniques and given that data
problems such as measurement error are likely to be more severe for countries than for regions,
we might reasonably expect the fits of the FED model to be worse on the international data.
However, it is possible that higher trade costs at the international level could work in the opposite
direction, leading to better fits of the FED model.
We address this empirical question by regressing output on factor endowments for the
OECD, using the same set of manufacturing industries employed in the analysis of prefectures.36
In our international regressions, we include the three factors used in our basic specification, as
well as arable land and mineral endowments. We add the latter two factors because they have
been used in previous studies, and because they are likely to be more relevant for international
comparisons.
One striking feature of the results is that the explanatory power of these regressions, as
measured by the adjusted R2, is much higher than those obtained for the regional sample (cf.
Tables 9a and 9b). As Table 13 indicates, the regressions of output on factor endowments using
international data have an average R2 of 0.86 and an average adjusted R2 of 0.84—almost double
those of our five-factor runs on prefectures.37

The high adjusted R2’s obtained from the

international regressions are of the same magnitude as those obtained in other studies of this type,

36Note

that the sample used in testing the FED model of production is different from that used to test the
HOV model of production. The reason for the difference in sample coverage is as follows. To compare BX = V,
we needed production data on all 29 sectors. Thus, we had to omit some OECD countries for which we did not
have the necessary data (e.g., Great Britain), and we included a number of non-OECD countries for which we did
have this data (e.g., Argentina). We could have included more nations in the regressions of X on V, but we elected
to use only the OECD countries to facilitate comparisons with previous studies by Harrigan (1995) and Davis and
Weinstein (1996).
37We were also concerned that the higher R2's might be the result of using only 22 observations and 6
regressors, so we also reran our prefectural results with only 22 prefectures but obtained R2's and adjusted R2's
similar to those obtained from runs with 47 prefectures.

33
such as Harrigan (1995) and Davis and Weinstein (1996), and provide a preliminary indication
that the FED model performs better at the international level than at the regional level.38
Turning to the prediction errors, which we consider to be a more telling measure of the
model’s accuracy, we find that the factor-endowment-driven production model fares worse than it
did in previous studies of international data. The average prediction error is 67%, or more than
1.5 times the value reported by Harrigan in a time-series analysis of the same data.39 The crosssectional variation in OECD output appears even harder to explain than the time-series variation.
Nonetheless, like the R2’s, the prediction errors exhibit better performance for the international
sample than for the regional sample. The 67% average prediction error is only one-sixth as large
as that obtained for the same tradable industries using regional data. These results cast further
doubt on the conjecture that missing factors may be explaining our regional results. If missing
factors are important in explaining the poor fits of the regional runs, then these missing factors
must be relatively unimportant in explaining international specialization. Since most missing
factors that one might think of would matter more for international rather than intranational
specialization, the possibility that missing factors are driving our results seems even more remote.
Trade costs, however, do offer a potential explanation for the superior international fits.40
It is reasonable to conjecture that trade costs are larger and more pervasive at the international
level, and thus eliminate more of the overall indeterminacy. If so, the high R2's obtained from
international data may tell us less about the performance of the factor-endowments-driven
production model per se than about the interaction between the production model, the
consumption model, and trade costs.
(1984) obtained R2's of around 0.6, but his data sample included a much larger and more
diverse set of countries than our study and the other two papers mentioned in the text.
39 Aside from the fact that we use cross-sectional data and Harrigan used time-series, the main reason for
the difference in the fits is that we include two countries that are large outliers in productivity and endowments that
were dropped from Harrigan’s analysis: Turkey and Yugoslavia. If we had dropped these countries our fits would
have improved, but since our point was to show that the international fits are significantly better than the regional
ones, we were hesitant to trim the sample in our favor.
40 Another possibility is that the higher variance in the international data makes it easier to obtain higher
2
R . To correct for this possible bias, we deleted the largest and smallest countries in the sample (the US and New
Zealand). As one can see in Table 3, this reduces the variation in the international sample to a level similar to that
in the regional. Using this smaller variance sample had no impact or actually improved the international fits.

34
In summary, the production estimates derived from regressions of outputs on factor
endowments are far from perfect at the international level, with an average prediction error of
67%.

As at the regional level, there appears to be a significant amount of production

indeterminacy, consistent with the existence of more goods than factors. However, the output
estimates for the OECD sample are substantially more accurate than those obtained for the
regional one. At first glance, this finding seems odd, since identical production techniques prevail
across Japanese prefectures but not across countries. We can explain this discrepancy, along with
the dramatically better fits of the FED model for non-tradables than for tradables within the
regional sample, by invoking trade costs. In theory, trade costs can impose some structure on
production patterns when there are more goods than factors; in practice, we find that production
indeterminacy is lowest in contexts where we would expect trade costs to be highest.
Notice that this result is precisely the opposite of what is commonly assumed in empirical
analysis. Several investigators [e.g., Saxonhouse (1983, 1986, 1989), Leamer (1988a, 1988b),
and Noland (1993)] have regressed trade on factor endowments and then interpreted large
residuals as an indication of trade barriers. Our results suggest that the residuals will be larger in
the absence of trade barriers and other trade costs. Using these residuals to estimate trade
barriers is therefore likely to produce a backward result.

Indeed, our analysis provides an

explanation for the puzzle identified by Pritchett (1996), namely the negative correlations between
Leamer’s (1988b) measures of openness and observed measures of tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and
price distortions.
VI. Conclusion
Trade economists have long known that, if there were more goods than factors, it would
be impossible to predict outputs solely on the basis of factor endowments. However, for the most
part the implications of this theoretical conclusion have been disregarded. In empirical work, it is
often assumed that the world behaves “as if” production were determinate. Theorists, too, have
sometimes dismissed the possibility of production indeterminacy, as exemplified by Xu’s (1993)

35
contention that “the problem of indeterminate trade pattern should be regarded as an intellectual
curiosity, rather than a real world phenomenon.”
However, in this paper we demonstrate that production indeterminacy is substantial in the
type of real-world data sets typically used by empirical trade economists. Moreover, we discover
that the degree of indeterminacy is greatest when trade barriers and trade costs are relatively low,
e.g., for regional data and for manufactured goods.
We arrived at these conclusions by utilizing both regional and international data. Using
regional data, we verified the HOV model of production and the multidimensional Rybczynski
relationship derived by Ethier. In doing so, we established that the regional data sample was not
subject to many of the possible reasons that the HOV model might fail—e.g., scale economies,
heterogeneous technologies, regional industrial policy, lumpy regions, and measurement error.
Given this, our finding that the FED model of production performs terribly at the regional level
suggests either that the world is best described as having more goods than factors, or that there
are missing factors.

Unable to identify additional factors that improved our predictions of

production patterns, we therefore concluded that the “square” assumption of equal numbers of
goods and factors does not provide a good approximation of reality.
For international data, by contrast, the HOV model of production is an empirical failure.
Countries do not appear to use identical techniques of production. Nonetheless, when we used
international data on factor endowments to predict outputs, the regression fits (as measured by
R2) were substantially better and the prediction errors much smaller than they were for the
regional data set. We surmised that the improved ability to predict production patterns at the
international level is the result of trade barriers and other international trade costs putting some
structure on national production patterns. Much the same phenomenon was observed in the
regional data, where prediction errors were 20 times lower for non-tradables than for tradables.
These results thus support Leamer’s (1984) and Xu’s (1993) contention that trade costs act to
reduce production indeterminacy. They do not completely eliminate the indeterminacy, however.

36
A practical implication of our results is that one should exercise great caution in
interpreting regressions of production (or commodity trade) on factor endowments.

These

regressions typically generate high R2's on international data, but this result is merely reflective of
the correlation between trade and factor endowments and of the interaction of these two elements
with trade costs. The estimated coefficients do not correspond to Rybczynski derivatives in the
theoretically specified manner.
A primary application of such regressions has been the estimation of trade barriers. Some
previous researchers [e.g., Saxonhouse (1983, 1986, 1989) and Leamer (1988a, 1988b)] have
regressed trade on factor endowments and then interpreted the residuals as an indication of trade
barriers. Ironically, we find that the residuals are likely to be much larger in the absence of trade
barriers and other trade costs. Our results therefore explain the disconcerting finding of Pritchett
(1996): the observed negative correlation between Leamer’s (1988b) measures of openness and
conventional measures of tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and price distortions.
One important finding of ours is that, within sets of regions that are not separated by trade
barriers or segmented by high trade costs, the strongest relationship between outputs and factor
endowments that can be maintained is the HOV model of production. However, trade costs do
render a certain degree of determinacy at the international level. This two-tiered structure of
production suggests that theorists and empirical economists should try to build trade costs
explicitly into their trade models.
In order to make progress in understanding the location of production (and hence patterns
of commodity trade), it is necessary to acknowledge that the world is not square. Instead of
treating production indeterminacy as a nuisance to be eliminated by assumption, we must confront
this phenomenon directly.

DATA APPENDIX
PREFECTURAL ENDOWMENTS
The numbers of workers by educational attainment were entered by prefecture directly from the
Employment Status Survey of 1987 (Shugyo Kozo Kihon Chosa Hokoku). The capital stocks were
imputed from prefectural investment data. Japan’s yearly Prefectural Accounts (Kenmin Keizai
Keisan Nempo) give investment flows for each prefecture from 1975 to 1985. These flows were
used to impute capital stock levels for each prefecture in 1985, using capital goods price deflators
from the National Accounts (Kokumin Keizai Keisan Nempo) and a rate of depreciation of 0.133
(This was the same rate of depreciation used by Bowen, Leamer, and Sveikauskas (1987)). Each
year’s flow was deflated using a capital deflator from the National Accounts.
WORLD ENDOWMENTS
World endowments of capital stocks were calculated using investment flows between 1975 and
1985 from the Summers and Heston (1988) data set. As in the prefectural data, we used a
perpetual inventory method (with a depreciation rate of 0.133) and capital price deflators from
Summers and Heston to calculate capital stocks. In order to maintain compatibility with Davis,
Weinstein et al. (1997) world endowments of labor force by educational level were taken from the
UNESCO Statistical Yearbook. Once again we had a scaling problem arising from the fact that the
Summers and Heston numbers and the UNESCO numbers did not match the Japanese numbers
exactly. We therefore scaled each country’s capital stock by the ratio of our calculated Japanese
capital stock to the Summers and Heston value for the Japanese capital stock. The imputed
international labor endowments were similarly scaled by the proportional difference between the
UNESCO numbers and the actual Japanese endowments. For our regressions of international
output on endowments, land data was taken from Leamer (1984) and mineral output data from
Davis and Weinstein (1996). Education data was taken from Reeve (1998). Reeve assembled a
broad cross-section of education endowment data by using Barro and Lee data on shares of the
population over 25 with various levels of education (from the UNESCO source above) and
multiplying it by labor force numbers from Summers and Heston.
PREFECTURAL PRODUCTION
The gross output of 20 manufacturing sectors in each prefecture was taken from the Japanese
Census of Manufactures for 1985. The gross output of 9 non-manufacturing sectors in each
prefecture was taken from the Prefectural Accounts for 1985. Finally, these totals were scaled so
that the 47-prefectural total for each sector exactly matched the total Japanese output as reported
in the 1985 Input-Output Table of Japan. Thus, in effect, the data from the Census of
Manufactures and from the Prefectural Accounts was used in order to distribute total Japanese
output for each sector across the 47 prefectures as accurately as possible.
WORLD PRODUCTION
Data on international levels of production used in tests of BX = V came from the United Nations'
National Accounts Statistics: Main Aggregates and Detailed Tables, 1985. These numbers
differed slightly from the numbers reported in the Japanese IO table, so the output of each sector
in every country’s output was scaled by the factor necessary to make the international data on
Japan match the IO data. Where countries only reported value added rather than gross output,
we scaled the value added by the ratio of gross output to value added in that sector in Japan. The

data were then converted to Yen using exchange rate data from the IMF’s International
Financial Statistics.
Because the COMTAP database provides more detailed sales numbers than the UN, we used
COMTAP data for our regressions Data on OECD production was taken from the COMTAP
Database. This data was graciously provided by James Harrigan and is available in Feenstra et al.
(1997)
TECHNOLOGY
Each element of the 3x29 technology matrix B was calculated by dividing Japanese total output
for the 29 sectors into the number of each factor present in each sector. Most of the data on
college and non-college workers in each sector came from the 1988 Wage Census. There were
some gaps in this data as follows: 1) There was no data for college and non-college workers for
agriculture, forestry, and fisheries or for government. These numbers were taken from the 1987
Employment Status Survey. 2) There was also no data for the petroleum/coal and leather
industries. Total employment for each of these sectors was taken from the 1985 Census of
Manufactures. The number of college workers per unit output for each was then imputed by
assuming that petroleum/coal has the same fraction of college workers as the chemicals sector and
that leather has the same fraction as manufacturing overall. The capital stocks in each of the 29
sectors were imputed from investment numbers, using the Annual Report of the Corporation
Survey for non-manufacturing and the Census of Manufactures for manufacturing.
