Introduction
Every major proposal for national tobacco legislation introduced during the past two

years called for significant increases in the price of cigarettes as a way to discourage teens from
smoking. The original June 20, 1997 agreement between the tobacco industry and states'
Attorneys General called for the costs of the settlement to be passed on to smokers in the form of
higher prices, which would have increased cigarette prices by 62-cents per pack, or more
(Federal Trade Commission, 1997). Senator McCain's proposal included a $1.10 increase to be
phased in over five years while Senator Kennedy proposed a $1.50 increase phased in more
rapidly, with both calling for adjustments to keep pace with inflation. Larger increases of up to
$2.00 per pack were proposed by various public health groups.
A number of issues concerning the effectiveness and appropriateness of using large price
increases to discourage youth tobacco use were raised in the debate over these proposals and
ultimately led to their defeat. In addition, opponents of the price hikes suggested that even if
they did succeed in discouraging youth from smoking, large cigarette price increases would lead
youths to substitute towards other substances, particularly marijuana. While there is little, if any,
empirical evidence that this type of substitution would occur, there is considerable evidence to
suggest the opposite could result. That is, in addition to reducing youth smoking, higher
cigarette prices could reduce other substance use among youth. For example, cigarettes have
long been thought to be a “gateway drug,” in that early experimentation with cigarettes
encourages youths to try marijuana and other illicit substances (i.e. Kandel, 1975; Ellickson,
Hays and Bell, 1992; Kandel and Yamaguchi 1993). Other research has concluded that cigarette
smoking is a significant predictor of both the probability and frequency of other drug use (i.e.
Clayton and Ritter, 1985; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1988; Henningfield,

2

Clayton, and Pollin, 1990). For example, citing data from the 1985 National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse, the 1988 Surgeon General Report states that teens who smoke are three times
more likely to use alcohol, eight times more likely to use marijuana, and twenty-two times more
likely to use cocaine (USDHHS, 1988). Using the same data, Henningfield and his colleagues
found that young daily cigarette smokers were 114 times more likely to have used marijuana
heavily (11 times or more in the past 30 days). This suggests that cigarettes and other substances
are complements for one another and that higher cigarette prices, by discouraging smoking
among youth, could also lead to significant reductions in youth and adult drinking and illicit drug
use.
The fact that policy makers are considering the ripple effects of policies targeting one
substance on the use of other substances is a major leap forward in the area of substance control
policy. However, the economic research exploring the relationship between the demands for
different drugs that is needed to inform these discussions is sorely lacking. This paper begins to
address the gap in existing research by examining the relationship between the contemporaneous
demands for cigarettes and marijuana in a nationally representative sample of eighth, tenth, and
twelfth grade students from the 1992 through 1994 Monitoring the Future Study. In particular,
this paper examines the impact of cigarette prices, tobacco control policies, marijuana policies,
and alcohol prices on youth cigarette smoking and marijuana use. Estimates generated from two
part models indicate that higher cigarette prices, in addition to reducing youth smoking, will
significantly reduce the average level of marijuana used by current users. They further suggest
that higher cigarette prices will reduce the likelihood that youths use marijuana, although these
findings are not significant at conventional levels. Elasticities calculated from short and long
form specifications suggest that a 10% increase in the price of cigarettes would reduce the

3

probability of using marijuana between 3.4%-7.3% and decrease the average level of marijuana
use by regular users between 3.6%-8.4%.

II. Literature Review
In part because of the lack of good data on the prices for and use of illicit drugs,
economists have contributed little to the debate over the relationship between cigarette smoking
and other drug use. To date, only three studies have analyzed the economic relationship between
the demands for cigarettes and marijuana. In the only published analysis, Pacula (1998a) used
data from the 1984 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to estimate the current
demand for alcohol and marijuana for a sample of young adults between the ages 19 and 26.
Although she did not estimate a demand equation for cigarettes directly, she included the current
state cigarette tax as an additional regressor in her models in order to identify whether a
significant cross-price effect exists. Her analyses also included state and federal beer taxes, the
minimum legal purchase age for alcoholic beverages, an indicator for decriminalized states, and
the crime per officer ratio, which was her proxy for the monetary price of marijuana. Pacula
found that cigarette taxes had no significant effect on the current likelihood of using marijuana or
the conditional quantity consumed. She reached the opposite conclusion, however, in later work
that focused on the intertemporal relationship between alcohol and marijuana using data from the
1983 and 1984 NLSY (Pacula, 1998b). In this analysis, which controlled for persistence in the
consumption of both drugs over time, Pacula found that cigarette prices have a negative and
statistically significant effect on the probability of using marijuana, suggesting that cigarettes and
marijuana are economic complements for young adults. She also found that higher past prices of
cigarettes have a negative and significant effect on the probability of using marijuana, supporting

4

an intertemporal complementary relationship between the two substances. Although much of
the inconsistency in findings across these two studies can be attributed to differences in controls
and model specification, this variation in findings is still unsettling.1
In a working paper using more recent data, Farrelly, et al (1998) estimated the decision to
use alcohol, tobacco and marijuana for a nationally representative sample of youths (ages 12 to
20) and young adults (ages 21 to 30) from the 1990-1996 National Household Surveys on Drug
Abuse. Measures of the real price of beer, the real price of cigarettes, marijuana possession
arrests over total arrests and cannabis eradication (used as a proxy for the monetary price of
marijuana) were included in probit specifications of the probability of using each substance,
making it possible to analyze cross-price effects. They further controlled for unobserved timeinvariant state-specific effects that may be correlated with policy measures by including a series
of dummy variables for each state. Their results indicated that tobacco, marijuana and alcohol
are economic complements for youth. Higher cigarette prices decreased the probability of using
marijuana, as did higher beer prices. The calculated cross-price participation elasticities of
cigarette prices and alcohol prices on marijuana use were –0.49 and –1.05, respectively. Crossprice effects for adults, however, were insignificant although the signs indicated a weak
complementary relationship.
This paper builds on this limited econometric research by further investigating the
relationship between the demands for tobacco and marijuana among youths. Unlike previous
studies, this study examines the prevalence and average level of use of cigarettes and marijuana
among a nationally representative sample of eighth, tenth and twelfth graders. This age

1

In the contemporaneous analysis (Pacula, 1998a), the natural logarithm of the state tax was employed, which
significantly reduced the variation in this measure of price and reduced its expected predictive power. The later
analysis (Pacula, 1998b) entered the state average price of cigarettes, inclusive of taxes, linearly into the model.

group is particularly important for examining substance use behavior since most youths initiate
use during these years. Findings from this study can help inform the current debate over the
potential unintended consequences of raising cigarette prices.

III.

Data and Methods
The data on youth cigarette smoking and marijuana use employed in this study come

from the 1992 through 1994 Monitoring the Future Surveys of eighth, tenth and twelfth grade
students. The Monitoring the Future Survey is an annual school-based survey focused on youth
perceptions of, attitudes towards, and use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. The survey was
developed and is conducted by the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the University of
Michigan. Each year since 1975, ISR has surveyed a nationally representative sample of high
school seniors; beginning in 1991, comparable surveys of eighth and tenth grade students have
been conducted. Detailed information on the survey design and sampling methods is available
in Johnston, et al. (1998). Given the focus of the surveys on youth substance use, great care is
taken to ensure that the youths' responses are reliable and valid. See Johnston and O’Malley
(1985) for a detailed discussion of validity of these data.
Two measures of youth cigarette smoking are constructed from the survey data. First, a
dichotomous indicator of smoking participation is created from the answer to the question: “How
frequently have you smoked cigarettes during the past 30 days?” Anyone reporting a positive
amount is defined as a current smoker while those reporting having not smoked at all in the past
thirty days are considered nonsmokers. Second, a quasi-continuous measure of average daily
cigarette consumption is constructed by assigning the median value of the categorical responses
provided to that same question. The possible responses (and their assigned values) include: less

6

than one cigarette per day (0.5); one to five cigarettes per day (3); about one-half pack per day
(10); about one pack per day (20); about one and one-half packs per day (30); and two packs or
more per day (45).
Similar measures of marijuana use are constructed based on the responses to the question:
“On how many occasions (if any) have you used marijuana (grass, pot) or hashish (hash, hash
oil) during the last 30 days?”2 A dichotomous indicator of current marijuana use is set equal to
one for youth reporting one or more occasions and zero otherwise. A quasi-continuous measure
reflecting the frequency of use in the past month is constructed by assigning midpoint values to
the categorical responses as follows: 1-2 occasions (1.5), 3-5 occasion (4), 6-9 occasion (7.5),
10-19 occasions (15), 20-39 occasions (30), and 40 or more (40). While neither of these quasicontinuous measures is ideal for capturing total amount consumed, they are helpful in gauging
the impact of price and public policies on average daily cigarette consumption and the frequency
of marijuana use among teens.
A simple cross-tabulation of current cigarette and marijuana users obtained from the
1992, 1993 and 1994 surveys is reported in Table One. Less than one-quarter of the respondents
report using either of these substances in the past thirty days, with 22.7% reporting cigarette
smoking and 10.9% reporting marijuana use. While the majority of cigarette smokers (65.8%)
smoked only cigarettes, over seventy percent (71.0%) of marijuana users also report current
cigarette smoking.
In addition to the information on youth smoking and marijuana use, detailed
socioeconomic and demographic information is also collected in the surveys. A variety of
2

On Form 1 of the high school senior surveys, this question is broken out so that information pertaining to the use of
marijuana can be identified separately from the use of hashish. Forms 2-6, however, ask only the question shown
above. To make the responses compatible, the responses to the separate questions in form 1 are combined. If the

7

potential determinants of youth cigarette smoking and marijuana use are constructed from these
data, including: indicators of gender (male or female), race (white, African-American, and
other), current grade (eight, tenth or twelfth), marital status (married or engaged versus being
single), parental education (less than a high school education, high school graduate, and more
than a high school education for mother and father separately), family structure (live alone, live
with mother, live with father, both parents present, or other living arrangement), mother’s work
status while growing up (full-time, part-time, or stay at home), the presence of siblings, living in
a urban or rural area, and frequency of participation in religious services (no participation,
infrequent participation and frequent participation), and continuous measures of age, average
weekly income from all sources (employment, allowances and other), and average number of
hours worked weekly. Sample means and standard errors for these variables are provided in
Table Two.
Location-specific price and policy measures based on the county and state in which the
respondent lives were merged with the survey data. Several measures reflecting the full cost of
cigarette smoking by minors were included in the empirical models. The first is the state-level
price for a pack of 20 cigarettes, including generics, obtained from the Tobacco Institute’s annual
Tax Burden on Tobacco. This price represents the weighted-average price of a pack from single
packs, cartons and vending machine sales, and includes state-level cigarette taxes. These prices
are deflated by the national CPI (1982-1984=1) to obtain the real price of cigarettes. In addition,
a variable measuring the largest real price difference for a pack of cigarettes between the youth’s
state of residence and states within 25 miles of the youth’s county of residence is included to
capture potential cross-border shopping for cigarettes by young smokers. A larger difference in

respondent reports any use of either marijuana or hashish, he or she is defined as a current user. Frequencies were
summed after medians were assigned to each category separately.

8

border price is expected to have a positive impact on the probability of using cigarettes as well as
the average level of use.
Four additional measures of tobacco control policies were included to capture the general
state and local sentiment towards tobacco and youth access to tobacco products. The first is an
index of state and local restrictions on smoking in public places and private work sites. This
index is constructed as the sum of five variables capturing the fraction of the population in the
youth’s county of residence that is subject to state or local restrictions in each of the following
areas: private worksites, restaurants, retail stores, schools, and other public places. The second is
a similarly constructed index of state and local limits on youth access to tobacco. This index is
constructed as the sum of two state-level dichotomous variables - one indicating that the
minimum legal purchase age for cigarettes is at least 18 years and a second indicating that signs
stating the minimum legal age are required at the point of purchase - and three continuous
measures - representing the fraction of the population in the youth’s county of residence subject
to restrictions on vending machine cigarette sales, limits on the distribution of free tobacco
samples to youth, and licensure requirements for tobacco retailers. Third, a dummy variable
equal to one in states that earmark a portion of the revenues generated by cigarette excise taxes
to fund anti-tobacco activities, and zero otherwise is included. Finally, an indicator of smoker
protection laws is added. Data on state level policies were obtained from various years of the
Coalition on Smoking OR Health’s (CSH) annual State Legislated Actions on Tobacco Issues.
The primary source of information on local level restrictions was the National Cancer Institute’s
1993 Monograph summarizing major local control policies, updated with information from CSH.
To capture the full price of marijuana, a series of alternative measures reflecting the
potential legal costs associated with the possession of marijuana are included. The first is a

9

dichotomous indicator set equal to one in those states that have decriminalized the possession of
small amounts of marijuana, generally less than an ounce. In these states, it is not a felony to
possess small quantities of marijuana although it is still a crime. In addition, measures of the
median fine and jail time that can be imposed for possession of an ounce of marijuana on the first
offense are included. These data were obtained from various years of the Bureau of Justice
Statistics’ annual Sourcebook on Criminal Justice Statistics, augmented with information from
the states’ Controlled Substance Acts. In a few states, these measures could be constructed for
1994 only. Rather than lose respondents in these states, the penalties for marijuana possession
that were in place in 1994 were assumed to exist in 1992 and 1993 as well and a dummy variable
was created to identify the observations affected by this assumption. Sensitivity analyses are
conducted to evaluate the impact of this assumption on the estimates.
Because many teens that smoke cigarettes and/or marijuana also drink, a measure of the
price of alcohol is included in the cigarette and marijuana demand equations to control for the
possible relationships between cigarette, marijuana, and alcohol use. The real state tax on a case
of 24 12-ounce cans of beer is used as a proxy the price of alcohol because beer is by far the
drink of choice for youths these ages and because these data are available for all states. The beer
tax data were obtained from the Brewers Almanac.
After eliminating respondents with missing or inconsistent data, a sample of 109,612
youths remains.3 Given the limited nature of the dependent variable, two-part models are
employed to estimate youth cigarette and marijuana demand. In the first stage, the likelihood of
being a current cigarette or marijuana smoker is estimated using a probit specification. In the
second stage, the conditional quantity of cigarettes smoked daily and frequency of marijuana use

10

are estimated using log-linear least square methods. Robust standard errors that correct for the
clustering of observations at the state level are reported. These are obtained in STATA using the
robust cluster option, which is equivalent to requesting Huber-corrected standard errors. This
correction accounts for any unobserved correlation in the error terms across individuals within
the same state, which could be caused by an unobserved public sentiment toward healthy
behaviors for example, but assumes that this correlation is independent of the other regressors in
the model.
Two alternative specifications are presented for each equation. The first is a relatively
limited specification including the cigarette price and border price difference, beer tax, a
decriminalization dummy variable and a variety of socioeconomic and demographic variables
constructed from the survey data. The second is a more complete specification that includes the
four tobacco-related policy measures and the marijuana possession penalty variables. It is likely
that these additional variables are correlated with the unobserved state sentiment toward general
use of these substances and are therefore potentially endogenous. By including them as
additional regressors, however, we hope to obtain more precise estimates of the effect of
cigarette prices and marijuana decriminalization, whose estimates might otherwise be biased
upward because of potential correlation with this same unobserved state sentiment.4

3

Preliminary analyses including indicators for observations with missing data suggested that these data were
missing randomly and that the findings would not be significantly altered by deleting observations with incomplete
data.
4
A more precise way of dealing with the potential correlation between policy variables and the error term would be
to estimate a fixed-effect model, which we tried to do. Our relatively short panel does not provide us with sufficient
within state variation to estimate the model efficiently however. We therefore present results from the approach
described above.

11

IV.

Results
Table Three reports the marginal effect of a change in each of the independent variables

on the average probability that an individual currently smokes cigarettes or uses marijuana.5
Column one contains the estimates for cigarette smoking from the relatively limited specification
while column two contains those from the expanded specification. Similar estimates for the
probability of using marijuana are contained in columns three and four. Table Four reports the
estimates from the conditional demand equations in a similar fashion as Table Three.
Cigarette prices are found to have a negative effect in all estimated equations. The
estimated coefficients are significant at better than the one-percent significance level in three out
of the four cigarette equations. 6 When additional tobacco control measures are included in the
cigarette equations, the marginal effect of the cigarette price falls in the prevalence equation but
increases slightly in the conditional demand equation. The implied own-price elasticity for the
prevalence of cigarette smoking calculated from the short- and long-form specifications of the
model are –0.66 and –0.42, respectively, while those for the conditional demand equations are
–0.62 and –0.71. These are consistent with previous findings using these data but omit the
alcohol and marijuana policy variables (Chaloupka and Grossman, 1996; Chaloupka and Pacula,
1998).
Cigarette prices are also found to have a negative and generally significant effect in the
marijuana demand equations. Higher cigarette prices have a statistically significant effect on the
average level of marijuana use in both the long and short form specifications. In the prevalence
equations, the estimates remain negative but are no longer significant at conventional levels. The
5

Marginal effects for dichotomous variables are calculated as a change in these variables from “0” to “1”, not as a
one unit change from the mean.

12

estimate from the long form specification, however, is significant at the 7% level. The inclusion
of additional tobacco control and marijuana policy measures, shown in column four of both
tables, leads to a doubling of the estimates, raising some concerns regarding the precision of
these estimates. It is clear from these results, however, that higher cigarette taxes will not lead
youth to substitute marijuana for cigarettes. The implied cross-price elasticities from the shortand long-form specifications of the prevalence equations are –0.34 and –0.73, respectively, while
those from the conditional demand equations are –0.36 and -0.84. These estimates suggest that,
for teens, cigarettes and marijuana are economic complements for one another. The estimates for
the border-price variable generally support this finding of complementarity. Lower border
cigarette prices have a positive and, at times, statistically significant effect on the alternative
measures of cigarette smoking and marijuana use.
More comprehensive restrictions on cigarette smoking are estimated to have a negative
and significant impact on the probability of youth smoking, but appear to have little impact on
conditional cigarette demand. In contrast, these restrictions are not found to affect the
probability of youth marijuana use, but, surprisingly, are estimated to have a positive and
significant impact on the conditional frequency of use. None of the other tobacco-related policy
measures is significant in any of the eight equations. These findings suggest that laws limiting
youth access to tobacco products, earmark tobacco taxes for anti-smoking media campaigns,
and/or protecting smokers do not affect youth smoking or marijuana use. However, no controls
for the implementation or enforcement of these policies have been included in the models, which
are likely to influence these findings.

6

In general, statements concerning the significance of variables capturing alternative aspects of the own-full price
are based on one-tailed significance tests given the law of demand. Those concerning cross-prices are based on twotailed significance tests given the potential substitutability or complementarity of various licit and illicit substances.

13

With respect to the various proxies for the full price of marijuana, we find that youths
living in decriminalized states are significantly more likely to report currently using marijuana
and may consume more frequently. The positive effect on the average level of marijuana used
by current users is only statistically significant when additional tobacco controls and marijuana
policies are included. The magnitudes of the coefficients are also substantially influenced by the
inclusion of these policy variables. In contrast, the estimates indicate that youth smoking is
unaffected by state decriminalization status.
Youths who currently use marijuana and live in states where higher median fines can be
imposed for the possession of up to an ounce of marijuana consume less frequently than those
living in states with less severe fines. The comparable measures for jail sentences, however, were
not significant in either equation. It should be noted, however, that the indicator for youth in
states where the 1994 values of the penalty variables were assumed to apply in earlier years is
negative and significant in both of the marijuana use equations in which it is included, suggesting
that the findings for the penalty variables could change if more accurate measures were
available. Additional runs of the model, which are not presented here, verify that the estimates
for other key variables are unaffected by the inclusion or exclusion of the penalty data.
Neither of the marijuana penalty variables or the indicator for states where these data are
problematic is significant at conventional levels in the youth cigarette smoking equations. In
general, these estimates suggest that while youth marijuana use is reduced by increases in the full
price of marijuana, youth cigarette smoking is unaffected. To some extent, these findings
support the hypothesis that youth substance use progresses from cigarette smoking to the use of
other licit and illicit substances, as described above. That is, increases in the price of cigarettes
reduce the likelihood of marijuana use, but increases in the price of marijuana do not

14

significantly affect youth smoking. More research using longitudinal data is needed, however,
before this can be clearly established.
In contrast, the beer tax is found to have a generally insignificant effect on youth cigarette
smoking and marijuana use. The one exception to this is in the expanded version of the
conditional frequency of marijuana use equation where it is positive and approaches significance
at the 7% level, consistent with the hypothesis that alcohol and marijuana are economic
substitutes for at least young marijuana users. This lack of a consistent finding is consistent with
the mixed findings from prior research on the complementarity or substitutability of alcohol and
marijuana. DiNardo and Lemieux (1992) and Chaloupka and Laixuthai (1997), for example,
conclude that the two were substitutes among youth. In contrast, Farrelly et al (1998), Pacula
(1998a, 1998b) and Saffer and Chaloupka (1998) concluded that alcohol and marijuana were
complements for youth, young adults, and adults, respectively.
The findings with respect to the socioeconomic and demographic variables are generally
consistent with those obtained in other studies. Males are significantly less likely to report
currently using cigarettes than females, but among those who do smoke cigarettes young men
consume more on average than young women. Young males are also more likely to use
marijuana and to consume it more frequently than young females. African American and other
non-white youth smoke significantly less than whites, although only African-Americans are
significantly less likely to smoke marijuana. Older youths are both more likely to use either
substance and, for users, to use more frequently. Teens that work more hours, on average are
significantly more likely to smoke cigarettes, but not to use marijuana; among users, however,
those working more hours consume more cigarettes per day, and may use marijuana less
frequently. Income has a positive and significant impact on both the probability and conditional

15

use of both substances. Interestingly, however, the positive effect of income on the probability
of using both substances diminishes as income gets larger while the positive effect of income on
the conditional use of both substances increases with income.
Youths who attend religious services either frequently or infrequently are significantly
less likely to use both substances than youths who do not attend such services and, for users, to
consume less. Youths living in nontraditional families are significantly more likely to use either
substance and to use more often than those in families where both parents are present. Youth
with siblings, however, are less likely to consume either cigarettes or marijuana and, for users, to
consume less. Youths with mothers that worked more while they were growing up are
significantly more likely to use cigarettes or marijuana than those with mothers who stayed
home; among users, however, there are few significant differences. Youth cigarette smoking
appears to be inversely related to parental education, while marijuana use appears to have a Ushaped relationship with parental education, although the estimates for marijuana use are not
consistently significant. Finally, youths living in the Western states are less likely to smoke
cigarettes and smoke significantly less on average than youth living in the South, Midwest or
Northeast. They are more likely to use marijuana, however, and use significantly more on
average than youths living in other regions of the country.

V. Conclusions
Based on the estimates described above, the answer to the question posed in the title of
this paper is clearly "No" - higher cigarette prices will not increase youth marijuana use. Instead,
these estimates indicate that higher cigarette prices, in addition to reducing youth cigarette
smoking, would certainly lower the average frequency of marijuana use among youth users and

16

would likely lower the probability of using marijuana. According to these estimates, a tenpercent increase in cigarette price is predicted to lower the prevalence of youth marijuana use
between 3.4% – 7.3% and decrease the average level of marijuana use by regular users between
3.6% - 8.4%.
This finding is consistent with the evidence that youth substance use typically progresses
from cigarette smoking and other tobacco use to other licit and illicit substance use, implying
that policies that would be effective in reducing youth smoking would also lead to reductions in
youth drinking, marijuana use, and other illicit drug use. In addition, this finding is consistent
with the evidence emerging from the qualitative research conducted by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention's network of prevention research centers. This research, based on focus
groups of young smokers from around the country, suggests that at least some young marijuana
users use cigarettes to enhance the high they obtain from smoking marijuana, implying that there
are complementarities between youth cigarette and marijuana smoking. Similarly, teens in these
groups consistently indicate that there are important qualitative differences between cigarette
smoking and marijuana use that would keep them from substituting towards marijuana should
cigarette prices increase dramatically (personal communications, George Balch and Robin
Mermelstein).
This research clearly takes a very small first step towards evaluating the impact of
changes in prices and control policies for one substance on youth use of other substances. Much
more research, ideally using appropriate longitudinal data that contain information on the
initiation and progression of youth substance use, is needed to adequately address these issues.
