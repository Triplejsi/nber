1. Introduction
Illicit drugs impose significant costs on society and on the individual users. These costs
include increased crime, health problems and employment problems. Because of these
considerable costs, both the federal government and state governments have made drug control an
important budget priority. According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)
1995, federal spending on drug control increased from $1.5 billion in fiscal 1981 to $17.8 billion
in fiscal 1999. This is an annual growth rate of over 14 percent. Spending on criminal justice,
interdiction and international programs has remained at about 60 to 70 percent of total drug
control spending. State government drug control expenditures are also for both criminal justice
programs and public health programs. Criminal justice programs include the enforcement of laws
pertaining to the use and sale of illicit drugs through expenditures on police, courts, prosecution,
and corrections. Public health programs include expenditures on drug education and treatment.
In addition, government must provide for the defense of individuals who are unable to provide
their own defense. Although the available data on state and local level spending are limited to
1990 and 1991, these expenditures have probably also grown over time. In 1991, state and local
governments spent $15.8 billion on drug control (ONDCP, 1993). Spending on criminal justice
was about 80 percent of total state and local spending on drug control. The purpose of this paper
is to estimate the effects of state level expenditures on criminal justice and public health in
reducing drug use.
To analyze the effects of criminal justice and public health spending, economists (i.e. Lee,
1993; Wagstaff, 1989) have employed a supply and demand model. This model assumes a
demand function which is downward sloping with respect to price and a supply function which is
horizontal or upward sloping with respect to price. Criminal justice spending directed at drug

1

dealers may increase the cost of doing business which would raise the price of illicit drugs and
reduce drug use. Criminal justice spending directed at users may shift the demand curve to the
left which would reduce drug use and reduce drug prices. Public health programs inform
potential buyers of the health risks associated with drug use and may also shift demand to the left,
reducing drug prices and reducing drug use. Public health spending may affect supply since some
users finance all or part of their consumption by selling drugs. Public health spending can reduce
the number of these low level user-suppliers and thus reduce supply. The effect of a given
expenditure on criminal justice or public health is dependent on the magnitude of the resulting
shifts in the two functions and the supply and demand price elasticities. While the supply and
demand model of drug markets is an important theoretical framework, there has been very little
quantification of this model until recently. The new empirical research is limited to estimation of
drug demand price elasticities. There is no empirical evidence concerning the effectiveness of
expenditures of criminal justice spending and public health spending in shifting supply and demand
functions and thus reducing drug use.

2. Theoretical Model
The empirical equations are derived from a supply and demand model of the illicit drug
market. The most general specification of the model includes criminal justice and public health
spending in both the demand curve and the supply curve. Public health spending may affect the
demand curve since these expenditures are assumed to increase knowledge of the negative health
consequences of drug use and thus reduce demand. Criminal justice spending may enter the
demand function since some part of criminal justice expenditure goes to enforcing sanctions
against users. Criminal justice enters the supply function since these programs increase costs.

2

Public health spending may also enter the supply curve since many low level drug suppliers are
also users and public health spending can reduce the number of these dealer-users. The demand
curve can be written as:
Q IJ = β1 P J + β2 PH J + β3CJ J + β4Z IJ + µ IJQ

(1)

and the supply curve can be written as:
P J = δ1 PH J + δ2CJ J + δ3X J + µ JP

(2)

where the J subscript refers to the Jth state and Q IJ = drug use by the Ith individual in the Jth state,
PJ = price in the Jth state, PHJ = public health expenditures per capita in the Jth state, CJ J =
criminal justice expenditures per capita in the Jth state, Z IJ = other demand factors for Ith
individual in the Jth state, X J = other cost factors in the Jth state and the µ are disturbance terms.
The demand function (1) shows that the individual’s demand for drugs is a function of
drug price, public health expenditures, criminal justice expenditures, other demand factors and a
disturbance term. The supply function (2) shows that price is a function of public health
spending, criminal justice spending, other cost factors and a disturbance term. This supply
function is infinitely elastic, since price is assumed to be primarily determined by expected
penalties and independent of the market clearing quantity. Reuter (1988) argues that production
and distribution costs have no significant influence on price but rather that prices are primarily
determined by expected penalties. The effect of criminal justice spending and public health
spending can be measured by estimating these two structural equations.
Criminal justice and public health spending can affect drug participation directly through
deterrent, education and treatment effects but can also affect drug participation by raising drug
prices. The structural demand model holds the effect of drug prices constant. A reduced form
model can be defined which eliminates drug prices. Substitution of equation (2) into equation (1)

3

results in the reduced form equation (3), which estimates the effect of criminal justice and public
health expenditures on equilibrium drug use without holding drug prices constant. The reduced
form equation can be written as:
Q IJ = π1PHJ + + π2 CJ J + π3 X IJ + π4 Z IJ + µIJRF (3)
The coefficients, π1 and π2 measure the marginal effect of public health expenditures and criminal
justice expenditures on equilibrium drug use. This specification also eliminates the collinearity
between drug prices and criminal justice spending and public health spending which is present in
the structural demand model.
Four recent empirical studies provide evidence that drug use is responsive to market
forces. Saffer and Chaloupka (forthcoming), estimated the effects of cocaine prices, heroin prices
and marijuana decriminalization using data from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.
The results showed a participation price elasticity for cocaine of -.28 and a participation price
elasticity for heroin of -.94. Marijuana decriminalization was found to increase the probability of
marijuana participation by about 8 percent. Grossman and Chaloupka (1998) used the
Monitoring the Future data to estimate the price elasticity of cocaine demand for youth. They
used a rational addiction model and found price elasticities ranging from -.6 to -2.4. They also
estimated participation elasticities of -.4 to -2.0. Bretteville-Jensen and Sutton (1996) studied the
price responsiveness of 500 Norwegian heroin users. The price and consumption data are selfreported. They estimated a price elasticity of heroin demand of -1.23. A study by van Ours
(1995) employed data on opium use in Indonesia during the Dutch colonial period. Opium is
pharmacologically similar to heroin. He found a price elasticity of -.7 to -1.0 for use and -.3 to -.4
for participation.

4

There are no prior published empirical studies of the effect of criminal justice expenditures
and public health expenditures on drug use or related outcomes. There is, however, a simulation
study by Caulkins et al. (1997) which estimates the cost effectiveness of enforcement relative to
treatment. They find that treatment is more cost effective in reducing drug use than enforcement.

3. The Data Set
A data set derived from the 1990 and 1991 National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse
(NHSDA) was employed for estimation. This data set consists of over 40,000 observations,
which is important since a large sample increases the number of drug users surveyed and the
precision of the estimates. The NHSDA are cross-sectional surveys of the US household
population aged 12 or older and contain information on socioeconomic characteristics as well as
data on drug use.1 These surveys exclude residents of non-institutional group quarters (i.e.
college dormitories) and exclude residents of institutional group quarters (i.e. prisons). Also
excluded are those people with no permanent residence (i.e. homeless and residents in transient
hotels). Less than two percent of the population is excluded. The excluded two percent probably
have a higher percentage of frequent drug users than the included 98 percent. Although there is
no strict dichotomy between occasional and frequent drug users, these surveys are likely to be
more representative of occasional drug users rather than frequent drug users. The 1991 survey is
over three times as large as the 1990 survey.
The dependent variable is defined as equal to one if the respondent used any illicit drug
during the past year and is otherwise equal to zero. A dichotomous variable of this type is usually

5

referred to as a measure of drug participation. Drug use is usually defined as a continuous
variable measuring a specific quantity over time.
State and local criminal justice spending for drug control, public health spending for drug
control and public defense spending related to drug control for 1990 and 1991 were taken from
State and Local Spending on Drug Control Activities prepared by the Office of National Drug
Control Policy (ONDCP), 1993. These data were collected as part of a special survey on drug
control done by the US Bureau of the Census. The data estimate expenditures for drug control
only. All of these variables were divided by state population since spending is likely to be higher
in states with larger populations. These data were appended, by state, to the data taken from the
NHSDA.
Criminal justice expenditures include expenditures on police activities, judicial activities,
prosecution and corrections. Increased police spending on drug enforcement is expected to have
a negative effect on drug participation because of its deterrent aspect and because it increases the
number of users who are incarcerated. Judicial activities include the cost of court activities
exclusive of prosecution and defense. These expenditures may or may not have a deterrent effect
on drug participation. Prosecution includes the cost of attorneys general, district attorneys and
other prosecutors. These expenditures may have a negative effect on drug participation to the
extent that they increase the probability of conviction. Corrections include the cost of
confinement and rehabilitation of those convicted or awaiting trial. This variable may have a
negative effect on drug participation if increased corrections expenditures proxy for longer
sentences. Correction might also have a negative effect on drug participation since some drug

1

Drug use data from DC were deleted since there were no drug control expenditure data collected from DC.

6

treatment was also provided by correctional institutions during the sample period. Since the work
of the police, judicial, prosecution and corrections programs are linked together, it is also
interesting to examine the collective effect of all of these criminal justice expenditures. To do
this, the four categories were aggregated to create a single criminal justice expenditure variable.
Public health expenditure includes expenditures on education and treatment. Treatment
includes expenditures for hospital facilities directly operated by state or local government and for
payments to private facilities. Treatment is expected to reduce drug participation. Education
includes expenditures by state and local government for elementary and secondary school drug
education and is also expected to reduce drug participation. Since these education expenditures
are limited to youth, the effect is expected to be greater for youth.
In addition, a public defense variable was created from the ONDCP data. This variable
measures expenditures on legal counsel paid by the court, or paid by government contributions to
private legal aid societies and bar associations sponsored programs and the costs of established
public defender programs. Increased defense spending may increase drug participation since more
resources go into defending users. This reduces the probability of conviction.
Economic theory predicts that the price of illicit drugs is a determinant of drug
participation. The ideal price variables for this study would be an index of the price of any illicit
drug, the price of marijuana and the price of cocaine. The drugs included in the any illicit drug
participation variable are marijuana, cocaine, heroin, psychedelics and a variety of other illicit
substances. An illicit drug price index variable should reflect the mix and proportions of these
substances. Drug price data, however, are very limited. Only the price of cocaine and the price
of heroin are available on a national basis. These data come from the US Department of Justice,
Drug Enforcement Agency's STRIDE data set. Drug Enforcement Administration agents and

7

police narcotics officers purchase cocaine and heroin regularly. The price, purity, weight and
other information are recorded in the STRIDE data set. The procedure described in Saffer and
Chaloupka (forthcoming) was followed to estimate state level cocaine and heroin prices.2 A state
level dichotomous indicator of marijuana decriminalization is also available. Marijuana
decriminalization is a law which specifically eliminates criminal sanctions for possession of small
amounts of marijuana and eliminates imprisonment for most first offense possession violations.
As a proxy for an illicit drug price variable, the price of cocaine, the price of heroin and marijuana
decriminalization are included in the regressions. Cocaine prices and heroin prices may be good
indicators of the price of any illicit drug since distribution problems are an important determinant
of drug prices and these problems tend to be similar for any illicit drug.
Additional economic and dichotomous demographic variables have been defined. These
include total personal income from all sources including wages, self-employment, social security,
public assistance, child support and other pension income. Income is a continuous variable
measured in 1983 dollars. The demographic variables are indicators of age, race, gender and
marital status. A variable defined as age and its square are also included to capture differential
age effects. A dichotomous variable equal to one if the individual reports that they are Black has
been defined. A similar variable was defined for Hispanics. A dichotomous variable equal to one
if the individual is male has also been defined. A variable for married has also been defined. There
were a number of missing values for this variable. Rather than deleting these observations or
omitting this variable, the missing values were estimated. A probit regression using the nonmissing marriage data as the dependent variable with income, age, education, race and ethnicity as

2

These data were appended at the state level since, due to confidentiality requirements, only the individual’s state

8

independent variables was estimated.3 This equation was used to predict the values of the
marriage variable for the missing observations. A variable measuring sentiment regarding
intervention by the state is also included. This variable is defined as the total state government
budget divided by the state population. The data on the total state budgets for fiscal 1990 and
1991 were also taken from State and Local Spending on Drug Control Activities. Finally, the
regressions include a time dummy variable for 1991. Summary definitions and means of all the
variables are presented in Table 1. The means for all variables for a subsample of individuals age
30 or less are also presented in Table 1.

4. Regression Results
In each of Tables 2 through 5 there are three probit specifications.4 In each table, specification
1 includes total spending on drug control. Specification 2 disaggregates total drug control spending
into criminal justice spending, education, treatment and public defense. Specification 3 further
disaggregates criminal justice spending into police, court, prosecution, and correction spending and
also includes education, treatment and public defense. Tables 2 and 3 are structural demand models
while Tables 4 and 5 are reduced form models. Tables 2 and 4 are for the overall population and
Tables 3 and 5 are limited to individuals age 30 or less. Estimation of the effects of drug control

of residence was available for the entire data set.
3
This equation used age, income, education, Hispanic and Black as independent variables. All variables were
highly significant. All variables were positive except Black. The regression correctly predicted 73 percent of the
known values.
4
All specifications were also estimated with state dummy variables, non-clustered robust standard errors and with
robust standard errors clustered by state. The state dummy variable specifications resulted in considerable
collinearity problems. The non-clustered robust standard errors were almost identical to the unadjusted standard
errors. The state clustered robust standard errors were in some cases significantly larger than the unadjusted
standard errors. These alternative specifications are not presented.

9

spending for this age group is interesting since this group has higher participation in illicit drugs
than older individuals.
It is important to estimate both the structural demand models as well as the reduced form
models since drug prices and drug control expenditures are highly correlated. The structural
models include both drug prices and drug control expenditures. Since drug price is assumed to be
independent of quantity there is no presumption of endogeneity between price and quantity in
estimating this demand model. However, there is collinearity between the drug control variables
and the drug price variables which affects the test of significance. The drug control coefficients in
the structural demand model estimate the effects of drug control on drug participation, holding
drug prices constant. That is, these coefficients represent the effect of drug control programs,
exclusive of the indirect effect that these programs have on drug prices. The reduced form model
eliminates drug prices by simultaneously solving the structural demand function and the structural
supply function for quantity. This eliminates the collinearity problems between drug control and
drug prices. The drug control coefficients in the reduced form model include the direct effects of
drug control on drug participation and the indirect effects of drug prices on drug participation.
The results for the structural models presented in Tables 2 and 3 show that total drug control
spending has a negative and significant effect on drug use. Criminal justice spending is also negative
and significant when disaggregated from total drug control spending. When criminal justice spending is
disaggregated into four expenditure categories the results are mixed. Police and correction
expenditures are significant for both the full sample and the younger sample. Court and prosecution
expenditures are each alternately significant in one sample or the other. The two categories of public
health expenditure are both insignificant. Defense spending is always positive and significant as
expected. The drug prices have the expected sign and are generally significant. Marijuana

10

decriminalization is also found to increase drug use. Heroin price is only significant in one
specification, but cocaine price is significant in all four specifications. The results for the remaining
income and demographic variables are discussed with the results for these variables from the other
tables.
The results for the reduced form model presented in Tables 4 and 5 again show that total drug
control spending has a significant negative effect on drug use. Criminal justice spending is again
negative and significant when disaggregated from total drug control spending. Police and correction
expenditures are also negative and significant. Education remains insignificant as in the structural
model. The most interesting change from the structural model is in treatment which becomes negative
and significant. This may suggest that treatment reduces the number of user-dealers which raises prices
and reduces use. Defense spending remains positive and significant as in the structural model. The
reduced form model has, in addition, the size of state government variable which is positive and
significant in all specifications.
The remaining variables are income and demographic. Income is in general negative in the
overall sample, but insignificant in the age 30 or less sample. Illicit drug participation increases
with age and then decreases. The results generally indicate that drug participation by Blacks is
either lower or about the same as the overall population. Drug participation by Hispanics is lower
than the overall population. This study confirms the results found in other studies that illicit drug
participation is higher for men and lower for married individuals.

5. Discussion
The main findings from the regression results are that overall drug control spending
reduces illicit drug participation and that police work and drug treatment are the most important

11

drug control programs. The results for police work are consistent with the empirical economic
literature on crime which in general concludes that increasing the certainty of arrest is more
effective than increasing the severity of the sanction. The results for drug treatment are also
consistent with the literature on drug treatment which finds that treatment reduces drug use for
both the general population and for individuals in the criminal justice system (ONDCP, 1999).
The limited results for drug education may result from the fact that, during the sample period,
state spending on drug education was limited to elementary and secondary schools and may also
be a result of poorly designed older programs. These problems are being addressed by the newly
funded, five year, $2 billion multimedia campaign designed to educate youth about drug use.
There are two interesting policy questions which can be examined with these regression
results. The first question is: What is the benefit-cost ratio for government drug control? That is,
is the marginal dollar value of the social benefits from drug control greater than the marginal
expenditure on drug control? The second question is: If social benefits exceed costs, is criminal
justice spending more efficient than public health spending?
These questions can be addressed by the assumption that the probability of drug use (the
dependent variable) is approximately equal to the number of drug users in the population and by
computing the marginal effects of the drug control variables.5 The estimated marginal effects are
equal to the change in the number of drug users, over population, with respect to drug control
expenditures, over population. Since population is in both the numerator and denominator, it
cancels out. The marginal effect thus approximates the effect of a unit increase in a drug control
spending variable on the number of drug users. The drug control variables are measured in

12

thousands of dollars. For example, the marginal effect of criminal justice spending is -.5770
which means that a $1,000 dollar increase in criminal justice spending would reduce the number
of drug users by .5570. This can be solved for the amount of added criminal justice spending
needed to deter one additional person from using drugs. This value, which is $1,733, is
convenient to compare with the social benefits of deterring one person from using drugs.
The marginal reduction in drug use from drug control can be estimated with the reduced
form models estimated for the overall population and presented in Table 4. These regressions
may be the best to use for this exercise since they include the entire population and they include
both the direct effect of drug control on drug use as well as the indirect effect of drug control on
price, which also affects drug use. To answer the first question, the marginal effect of total drug
control spending is estimated from equation 1 in Table 4. The estimated value is -.2395. This
suggests that an additional expenditure of $4,170 on drug control will deter one person from
using drugs.
The social costs of drug use were computed by Rice (1990) and are reprinted in Rydell
and Everingham (1994) and updated in ONDCP (1999). The Rice calculations include costs of
drug use from property destruction, victims of crime, short hospital stays of users, and morbidity
and mortality of users. Rice also includes costs from pursuing a criminal career and costs from
losing productivity of individuals who are incarcerated. These latter costs are not included in this
analysis since the NHSDA only includes individuals who are living at home rather than in prison
or who are homeless. The total cost of drug use in 1985 was $18,427 million which is equal to
$23,324 million in 1991 dollars. In 1991, the population of the US age 12 or over was

5

The marginal effects are calculated by multiplying the density function for the equation by the variable’s
coefficient.

13

approximately 200 million and 13 percent of the population included in the NHSDA used illicit
drugs which is equal to 26 million drug users. With a total cost of $23,324 million and 26 million
drug users, the social cost of one drug users is $897.
The regression suggest that an additional expenditure of $4,170 on drug control will deter
one person from using drugs. The social cost of a drug user is estimated at about $897. That is,
the estimated cost of deterring one person from drug use is greater than the cost to society of
letting that person use illicit drugs.
These cost calculations must be viewed with some caution since the costs of drug use are
inherently difficult to estimate. In addition, the costs and the estimated number of users include
both users of marijuana and other illicit drugs. The limited empirical evidence indicates that
marijuana is far less costly to society that other illicit drugs.6 However, a very large percentage of
the estimated total number of drug users, use only marijuana. The result of these caveats is that
the $897 estimated social cost of drug use is probably more reflective of the social cost of
marijuana rather than the social cost of other illicit drug use. The social cost of marijuana maybe
somewhat lower than the $897 estimate, while the social cost of other illicit drugs maybe much
higher than the $897 estimate.
The second question regarding whether criminal justice is more effective than public health
is somewhat more complicated. The complication, in part, results from the connection between
the criminal justice programs. Police spending was found to be a significant deterrent to drug use,
but for police work to be effective it must be followed by court, prosecution and in the event of
conviction, some type of sanction. The criminal justice variable in specification 2, in table 4,

14

includes all of these programs. The marginal effect of criminal justice spending is -.5770 which
means that $1,733 of added criminal justice spending will deter one person from using drugs. The
marginal effect of treatment is -.8286 which means that $1,206 must be spent on treatment to
deter one person from using illicit drugs. This suggests that treatment is more cost effective than
criminal justice in deterring drug use. Another complication in this question results from the
connection between criminal justice and treatment. Criminal justice and treatment are not
necessarily alternative approaches to drug control, and may be combined. The corrections
variable is never significant, while treatment is significant. This suggests that a more effective
method of reducing drug use might be to direct drug using offenders into a treatment and
rehabilitation environment rather than into a prison environment. That is, illicit drug participation
might be viewed as more of a public health problem than as a criminal justice problem. According
to ONDCP, 1999 the availability of treatment in prisons and through the new drug court system,
which provides alternatives to incarceration, has increased since the sample period. A recent
report issued by the Arizona Supreme Court (Wren, 1999) concludes that the state saves money
by offering convicted non-violent drug offenders probation with treatment, in lieu of prison. The
regression results presented in this study also suggest that treatment in place of prison is a cost
effective approach to spending the drug control budget.

6

The Drug Abuse Warning Network indicates that for all drug related emergency room visits, only about 10
percent are for marijuana.
