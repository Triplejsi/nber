ABSTRACT
The United States transformed itself from a rural to an urban society over the last three

centuries. After a century of unremarkable growth, the pace of urbanization was historically
unprecedented between the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In the twentieth century, the

urban population continued to increase but in a much more dispersed maimer as the suburban
population increased. Throughout these developments, cities also exhibited considerable variation

in their population sizes. This paper find that the pace and pattern of U.S. urban development are

explained by changes in regional comparative advantage and in economies in transportation and

local public goods, which in turn were determined by the changes in the economic structures of
cities. This paper also finds that cities varied considerably in size because the larger cities reduced
market transaction costs associated with coordinating greater geographic division of labor.

I. Introduction.
The growing interest in the phenomena of increasing returns in economics has led to a
great deal of work on issues concerning the causes of industrial location and city formation. One
body of this work has been concerned with establishing the relative importance of natural

advantages and increasing returns in determining the location of industries. For scholars like
Krugman (1991) and Arthur (1994), the overall patterns of industrial location and city formation

are driven by increasing returns. On the other hand, Kim (1995, 1998, 1999) suggests that the
long-run trends in U.S. regional specialization are consistent with explanations based on
comparative advantage and Ellison and Glaeser (1999) find that natural advantages may explain

about half of the geographic concentration of industries. However, for scholars like Henderson
(1988), there is no conflict between comparative advantage and increasing returns. Indeed, some
types of increasing returns may be nested in comparative advantage. Henderson argues that while
comparative advantage may drive the overall proportion of economic activities of regions and
cities, increasing returns are likely to play an important role in explaining why cities exist and

where they locate.
Another growing body of work in urban and regional economics has attempted to identify
the nature of increasing returns. In particular, numerous studies have attempted to measure which
of the Marshallian externalities, technological spillovers, labor market pooling, or non-traded
industry specific inputs, is empirically most significant. In addition, studies have attempted to
identify whether these externalities are ones of localization or urbanization and whether they are

dynamic or static.' This paper stresses the importance of economies in transportation and in the

For example, see Ellison and Glaeser (1997), Dumais, Ellison and Glaeser (1998), Glaeser Ct. al
(1992), Henderson, Kuncoro, and Turner (1995), Black and Henderson (1997, 1998), Henderson (1998),

provision of local public goods. Trade involves transactions in information and in physical transfers

of goods between buyers and sellers. If there are economies in physical, port and terminal

operation in transportation, then the costs of trade are lower in cities. In addition, if there are
economies in the provision of local public goods such as water, gas, electricity, and

communications, cities may lower the costs of trade between firms and workers and between firms
themselves.2

Over the years, urban economists have also been interested in explaining why city sizes

differ. Despite the apparent historical persistence of this phenomenon, there seems to be little
consensus of the exact causes as to why city sizes differ. The standard textbook explanation for the
existence of an urban hierarchy is Christaller's (1966) central place theory which explains the size
distribution of cities based on economies of scale in retail markets. More recently, Dobkins and

loannides (1998) propose a central place theory based on mercantile or wholesale trade rather than
retail trade. However, there are a number of alternative theories. For example, Henderson (1988)
argues that the distribution of city sizes is due to economies of scale in manufacturing while others,
such as Krugman (1996) and Gabaix (1997), argue that the size distribution of cities is a statistical
artifact generated by a simple growth model.

This paper attempts to shed some light on the causes of industrial location and city
formation by documenting and examining the historical patterns of U.S. urban development. This

formation using local public goods (or market places) and transportation. Alternatively, the provision of

(1990)).

paper finds that the pace and pattern of U.S. urban development are explained by changes in
regional comparative advantage and in economies in transportation and local public goods. These
in turn were affected by changes in the economic structure of the American economy from
agriculture to manufacturing and then to services. In addition, the examination of the economic
structures of cities by their sizes suggests that cities varied considerably in size over time because
the larger cities performed special market-making functions.3 Regional comparative advantage led

to trade, but gains from trade did not come freely. In addition to the physical cost of transporting
goods, the geographic division of labor increased market transaction costs. The concentration in
large cities of market coordinators, as well as institutions which inspected, certified and enforced

contracts, reduced the transaction costs associated with this greater geographic division of labor.
In particular, the traders who held diverse private information concerning the supply and demand

of goods through the market process revealed their information so that the buyers and sellers
needed only to know the price and stochastic factors in the economy.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II documents the historical patterns of U.S.
urban development. Section III examines the causes of the long-run trends in U.S. urban
development. Section IV studies the relationship between the economic structures of cities and the
size distribution of cities. Section V concludes with a summary.

II. U.S. Urban Development, 1690-1990.
The history of cities in the United States has witnessed dramatic developments over the last

Like Dobkins and loannides (1998), this paper suggests that the size distribution of cities can be
explained by a mercantile theory of cities. However, whereas Dobkins and loannides (1998) motivate their
discussion using models from Fujita and Mon (1997), Krugman (1993), and Prod (1972, 1977), this
paper's theoretical motivation comes from Grossman (1989).

three centuries. In the late seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries, cities were few in number,
concentrated along the eastern seaboard, and their activities were dominated by merchants who

facilitated trade with Europe. In the early nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries, the onset of
industrialization and the expansion of the domestic market significantly increased the number and
size of cities. Moreover, a new type of city emerged in different places; unlike cities of the earlier

period, large industrial cities sprang up in the northeastern and mid-western regions. The growing
relative importance of services since the mid-twentieth century altered, once again, the overall

pattern of urban development. The importance of the urban population continued to rise, but in a
much more dispersed manner. The share of population in urban areas increased when measured in
terms of metropolitan areas, but in terms of cities defined by political boundaries, it peaked and
stabilized. Finally, this period witnessed a geographic shift in the share of large cities toward the

southwestern regions of the United States.
Table 1 presents data on the number and size of cities where city is defined as an area
having a population of greater than 2,500. Between 1690 and 1790, the number of cities increased

moderately from 4 to 24, but the percentage of urban population declined from 8.3% to 5.1%. In
the period between 1790 and 1880, the number and size of cities grew at historically
unprecedented rates. During this period, the number of cities increased from 24 to 939 and the
percentage of urban population increased from 5.1% to 28.2%. The era of industrial cities reached
its zenith between 1880 and 1920 when the number of cities increased from 939 to 2722, the
number of cities with populations of more than 100,000 increased from 20 to 68, and the
percentage of urban population increased from 28.2% to 51.2%. Although the number of cities
continued to increase during the second half of the twentieth century, the level of urbanization
4

peaked at 65% in 1960 and declined between 1960 and 1990 to 62%. Moreover, between 1960
and 1990, the proportion of urban population decreased in the largest cities with populations of
more than 500,000.
In the second half of the twentieth century, urban development in the United States was
also characterized by a dispersal of the population out of central cities into suburban areas. Table 2
shows the changes in the number and size of metropolitan areas.4 The information by metropolitan

areas provide a strikingly different picture of U.S. urban development than that painted above. The
data indicate that there was significant growth in the number of metropolitan areas in most size
categories and that the percentage of population in metropolitan areas increased from 5 1.0% to
77.5% between 1940 and 1990. Moreover, unlike the patterns exhibited in Table 1, the data in
Table 2 show a reduction in the metropolitan population in the two smallest-sized categories, a
slight increase in the middle-sized category, and a significant increase in the two largest-sized

categories. Thus, the urban population not only continued to increase over the second half of the
twentieth century as measured by metropolitan areas, but the very largest metropolitan areas
continued to thrive during this period.
The data indicate that the historical pace and pattern of U.S. urban development are closely
linked to the changes in the economic structures of cities. In the late seventeenth and the

As the definition of cities using political jurisdictions became unsatisfactory, the census officials
developed the metropolitan area concept using counties. For 1940, the data are from the CountyData Book
which defined the metropolitan area as a central city or cities having population of 50,000 or more and its
adjacent minor civil divisions which have a population of 150or more per square mile. While the essential
concept of metropolitan areas has not changed, the definition has been refined over the years. For 1990, the
data are from the Census of Population. The sample of metropolitan areas used in this paper consist of
primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSA's), broken up from consolidated metropolitan areas
(CMSA's) and metropolitan statistical areas (MSA's).

eighteenth centuries, the economic structures of cities were dominated by the merchants and the
surrounding hinterland activities in agriculture and other extractive industries. In the nineteenth
century, the economic activities of the majority of cities were dominated by manufacturing. By

1820, the cities in the United States already had a significant portion of their populations engaged
in manufacturing activities.5 Industrial activities continued to play a significant role in city

economies between the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries. Table 3 shows that
manufacturing employment as a percentage of population for large cities was 14.9%, 17.1% and
18.2% in 1880, 1900, and 1920 respectively.6 Since the mid-twentieth century, the importance of
manufacturing in cities declined significantly. In the two years 1940 and 1990, less than 10% of the

population in cities was engaged in manufacturing and by 1990, approximately 34% percent of the
population was engaged in services.7

The data in Table 4 show that large cities became concentrated in different geographic

regions over time. In the period between 1690 and 1820, the majority of cities were located along

In their study of Northeastern cities, Williamson and Swanson (1966) show that approximately 60%
of the labor force was engaged in manufacturing activities between 1820 and 1840. Since 33% of the
population was in the labor force during those years, about 20% of the population was engaged in
manufacturing. Williamson and Swanson (1966) derive their figures from the labor force data in the
censuses of population whereas the figures presented in Table 3 are based on the censuses of
manufacturing.
6 The census bureau provides more detailed information on large cities. However, the size criterion has
changed significantly over time. In general, large cities are defined as follows: in 1790, cities with
populations of greater than 2,500; in 1820, greater than 5,000; in 1880, greater than 20,000; in 1900,
greater than 25,000; in 1920 and 1940, greater than 50,000; and, in 1990, greater than 100,000. In Table
3, large cities for 1940 are defined as cities with populations of greater than 90,000.
Similar results are obtained for metropolitan areas.

Leven (1993) presents data on the geographic distribution of all urban and metropolitan population
between 1790 and 1988. In general, the overall historical trends are similar to those found in Table 4.

the eastern seaboard in the New England, Middle Atlantic and South Atlantic regions. In the
period between 1820 and 1920, large cities emerged in new areas of the New England and Middle
Atlantic regions and in the East North Central region. During this period, 60% of large cities were
located in these three regions. The second half of the twentieth century ushered in yet another
significant change in the geographic distribution of cities. The share of cities in the northeast

decreased dramatically as the share in the southwest increased. The New England and Middle

Atlantic regions' shares of large cities fell from an apex of 21% and 25% at the turn of the century
to 4.6% and 6.6% respectively, whereas the shares in the West South Central, Mountain and
Pacific regions rose from 5%, 2%, and 5% to 14%, 9%, and 26% respectively.
Despite these dramatic historical changes in the number, size, location, and the economic
structure of cities, one characteristic of cities has remained remarkably stable. At any given point in
time, cities varied enormously in their population sizes. In particular, the size distribution of cities

has followed, what urban economists refer to as, the rank-size rule. The rule states that the
population of a city is equal to the population of the largest city divided by the rank of the city in
question. Surprisingly, the population size distribution of cities has been relatively stable despite
significant movements in the ranks of many cities.9 While some cities such as New York were able

to maintain their rankings throughout the last two centuries, the rankings of the majority of cities

Zipf's (1949) rank-size rule is a special case of the Pareto distribution: P = c R where P is
population, c and a are constants, and R is city rank. Zipf observed that constant a was equal to one and
constant c was equal to the population size of the largest city. The rank-size rule can be easily estimated
using least squares in the following logarithmic form: log (P) = log (c) - a log (R). The existence of a ranksize rule means that a equals 1. While the hypothesis that a equals I can be easily rejected for most time
periods, the log-linear specification does quite well. For cities, the estimated coefficient a, which was
statistically significant at the one percent level for all years, was -0.98 in 1880, but declined to -0.94, -0.91,
and -0.91 in 1900, 1920 and 1940 respectively, and then fell further to -0.76 in 1990. On the other hand,
for metropolitan areas, the estimated coefficient rose from -0.98 to -1.09 between 1940 and 1990.

have shifted considerably over time.'°
Thus far, the information on U.S. urban development has been based on a definition of a
city given by census and other government officials at any given point in time. However, defining a
city, especially a definition that is meaningful over time, is a non-trivial issue. While the census

definition of a city in the eighteenth century as being an area with a population of over 2,500 might
be useftil, that definition is unlikely to be useful in the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries.
The government officials have recognized this fact and have accordingly raised the threshold

population level for what constitutes a "large city" over time. However, the population cutoff
values have been based on absolute and arbitrary population levels. While the census and other
government officials' definition of a city may still provide valuable information on U.S. urban
development, it is important to examine whether an alternative definition of a city, perhaps one that
is more consistent over time, provides a different view of U.S. urban development.
Rather than defining a city based on a different absolute population cutoff value for various
points in time, it is possible to define a city based on relative cutoff values which are consistently

defined over time. In order to define a relative measure, the city population was divided by the
mean of the sample for cities in 1880, 1900, 1940 and 1990, and for metropolitan areas in 1940
and 1990." At any given point in time, for a city to be included in the final sample based on
relative values, a city's population divided by the mean of the sample needed to above the value of
the smallest city in 1990. The smallest city and metropolitan area were Chandler, Arizona and

cities for a consistently defined metropolitan area between 1900 and 1990.

Enid, Oklahoma and their populations divided by their sample means were 0.278 and 0.099
respectively. The relative definition eliminated a number of cities from the final sample for some

years, but the relative and the absolute cutoff values did not differ much for metropolitan areas.
Figure 1 presents the probability density estimates of the normalized city distribution for
large cities and metropolitan areas.12 In general, these estimates suggest a pattern of U.S. urban
development that is consistent with information given using the census definition of cities based on
absolute cutoff values. The density estimates for cities show three distinct density distributions for
cities. In 1820, when agriculture still dominated U.S. economic activities, the distribution of cities
was characterized by many small cities and a few very large cities relative to the mean. In 1880, as
manufacturing became more important, the distribution of cities shifted toward larger cities relative

to the mean. Since the middle of the twentieth century, however, as services became more
dominant, the importance of smaller cities has increased once again. On the other hand, consistent
with the information provided above, the trend is reversed for metropolitan areas. For these areas,
the density estimates show a greater importance for cities whose sizes are greater than the sample
mean.

III. Explaining the Historical Trends in U.S. Urban Development.

The American economy in the late seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries was dominated
by agriculture, fishery, and other extractive industries. Each of the regions of colonial British
America was endowed with a different climate, soil, and topography and as a result specialized in
different industries. The New England colonies specialized in fish, livestock, wood, and whale

values represent cities whose populations were below or above the mean respectively.

products, the Middle colonies in grain, the Upper South in tobacco, and the Lower South in rice
and indigo.13 These colonial economies were integrated with Europe and the West Indies for

political and economic reasons. Since the colonies were subjects of England, trade in some goods

such as tobacco was restricted to England. But more importantly, the potential benefits to trade
with Europe and the West Indies were far greater than inter-colonial trade due to the patterns of
comparative advantage and the transportation and communications technologies.
The cities during this period located near ports and navigable rivers and specialized in

providing mercantile services for an economy based on foreign trade. The concentration of
merchants in cities facilitated the coordination of the supply and demand over great distances. The
regular gathering of merchants in tea houses and merchants' exchanges and the establishment of
newspapers and trade papers provided timely information.'4 Cities also provided insurance and
banking services which also facilitated trade. However, given the prohibitive costs of transmitting
information during this period, the potential benefits of providing these intermediary services were
largely limited by the size of a city's hinterland.'5

Industrialization in the United States first took root between the late eighteenth and the

' If

the geographic distribution of the cities in this period is mainly determined by the size of a city's
hinterland economy, then there is a puzzle. From this perspective, the cities were over-represented in New
England and under-represented in the Upper South. In 1770, the New England region's population stood at
581,038 and its per capita value of exports was £0.85 whereas the Upper South had 649,615 people with a
per capita value of export of1.80 (see Shepherd and Walton (1972, 101)). However, New England
possessed a disproportionate number of cities when compared to the share of cities in the Upper South (see
Bridenbaugh (1995, 2 16-217)).

10

early nineteenth centuries in the Northeast and then spread to other regions.'6 The growing
importance of manufacturing, which coincided with the rise of the national domestic market,
increased the level and scope of trade dramatically. The economic integration of the regional

economies not only led to growth in regional specialization and trade, it also led to an increase in
the pace of urbanization. This section examines which theory of cities is most consistent with the
patterns of city formation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

The manufacturing data on cities are sparse for the early part of U.S. industrialization but a
rich data set exists for large cities in the latter part. The census bureau began collecting industrial

data on cities in 1880 and has continued to do so for every census year thereafter. Yet, despite the
existence of excellent data on cities since the late nineteenth century, few scholars have examined
them in any detail. One major reason for this neglect is that the information on cities during this

period is reported by very specific products since standard industrial codes (SIC) were not used
until the mid-twentieth century. In this paper, the data on cities for 1880 and 1940 were
aggregated to the 2-digit SIC using definitions from Niemi (1974) and the census bureau.'7
The sample of cities for 1880 and 1940 depended upon the decisions made by census

officials. In 1880, the Census of Manufactures reported data on the 100 largest cities; in 1940, it

reported data on 87 cities with populations of more than ioo,ooO.' The data on these large cities
16

See

Sokoloff (1986) and Goldin and Sokoloff (1984).

The industrial data on cities were constructed for 1940 rather than for 1920 because the data on

cities for 1940 are one of the most complete. For the 1940 census, officials devised a means to provide
more complete information on cities by reporting the data in a more aggregate industry level comparable to
the 2-digit industries and/or by aggregating the city data with county data.
18

In 1940, there were 92 cities with populations of greater than 100,000. However, information on 87

cities is available. The census officials omitted data on 7 cities for disclosure reasons, but then added two
cities, Lynn and Evansville, whose population sizes were slightly fewer than 100,000.
11

shown in Table 4 indicate that the average and median population in cities increased five-fold

between 1880 and 1940 from 91,000 to 424,422 and from 35,092 to 177,662 respectively. In
1880, the 100 largest cities represented about 18.1% of the total U.S. population and about 53.1%
of U.S. manufacturing employment whereas in 1940, the 87 largest cities represented about 28%
of the total population and 39% of total manufacturing employment.'9
The data in Table 6 indicate that cities were quite specialized in their manufacturing
structures at the 2-digit industries.20 In 1880, for 22% of the large cities, one industry accounted

for at least, and often far more than, half of their manufacturing employment and for another 24%
of the cities, two industries accounted for at least half of their manufacturing employment. In 1940,
despite a significant increase in their sizes, cities were equally specialized. In that year, 21.8% of
the cities had at least half of their manufacturing employment in one industry and another 25.3% in
two industries. However, within any given year, the larger cities were likely to be more diversified
than smaller cities because industries such as food, apparel, and printing were always well
represented in these cities.

In general, a city's manufacturing structure reflected that of the census region in which it
resided. The regression estimate of city industrial structures on their regional industrial structures

'

The growth rate in city population may be biased upward since the sample for 1940 may overrepresent larger cities as a result of the change in the cutoff procedure for reporting. However, similar
information from a consistent sample of cities indicates that the potential upward bias is small. From the
reported cities in 1880 and 1940 it is possible to construct consistent panel data for 60 cities which appear
in both years. This consistent sample eliminates 40 cities from the 1880 sample which were large enough to
be considered for reporting in 1880 but fell below the cutoff value in 1940 and 27 cities which were too
small to be in the 1880 sample but grew in size to populations of more than 100,000 by 1940. For the
consistent sample of 60 cities, the average and median populations increased four-fold from 123,141 to
513,002 and from 50,584 to 238,674 respectively.
20

Regional specialization and industry localization increased between 1880 and 1940. See Kim (1995)

for details.

presented in Table 7 suggests that they are significantly correlated. The data in Table 8 provide
more detailed information on the industrial structures of cities and their regions. In 1880, the cities
in the New England region were specialized in textiles and leather; cities in the Middle Atlantic
region were specialized in textiles and apparel; cities in East North Central were specialized in

food, lumber and wood; cities in West North Central were specialized in food, lumber and wood,
apparel, and stone, clay and glass; in the Southern and Pacific regions, cities were specialized in

food, tobacco, apparel, and lumber and wood. However, there were some important differences
between the industrial structures of cities and their regions. Some industries such as the apparel
and printing industries were over-represented in cities whereas the lumber and wood industry was
severely under-represented.2' In some regions such as the East South Central, West South Central,
and Pacific regions, tobacco manufacturing was over-represented in cities.

As the U.S. regions became more economically integrated between 1880 and 1940,

patterns of U.S. regional specialization changed. However, despite the changes in the patterns of
U.S. regional specialization, the correspondence between the manufacturing structures of cities and
their regions remained stable. In 1940, the large cities in New England maintained their
specialization in textiles, but also became more specialized in apparel and machinery; the cities in

the Middle Atlantic remained specialized in apparel and textiles but became more specialized in
food; the cities in the East North Central regions remained specialized in food but also significantly
shifted their specialization to primary metal, machinery, and transportation; the cities in the West
North Central region became significantly more specialized in food; South Atlantic cities became

specialized in food, tobacco, and apparel; the cities in the East South Central region became

21 See Alexanderson (1956).

13

specialized in food, textiles, furniture, and primary metal, in the West South Central region, they
became specialized in food, textiles, and apparel; the lone Mountain city became specialized in
food, tobacco, apparel, and primary metal; and cities in the Pacific region became specialized in
food and apparel (see Table 8).

In 1940, as in 1880, there were some systematic differences between the manufacturing
structures of cities and their regions. Once again, the large cities, when compared to their regions,
had a greater proportion of their manufacturing employment in apparel and printing whereas the
smaller cities had a larger share in lumber and wood. However, some new patterns also emerged.
Unlike in 1880, the textile industry became a small city industry in 1940. The South Atlantic and

East South Central regions had 41% and 23% of their manufacturing employment in textiles, but
only 7.8% and 10.6% respectively for cities in those regions. Petroleum manufacturing was also

overly represented in the smaller cities in the West South Central region. Petroleum accounted for
more than 10% of employment in that region, but was responsible for less than one percent in its
large cities. Tobacco manufacturing was, once again, centered in the large cities in the South
Atlantic and East South Central regions, but the pattern reversed in the Pacific region.
The study of the industrial composition of cities may not fully identify the sources of city

formation, but it does provide some important clues. The fact that the industrial structures of cities
reflect that of the census region in which they resided seems to suggest that city specialization is
driven by regional comparative advantage. Thus, increasing returns do not seem to explain the
overall proportion of regional and city specialization. However, increasing returns are likely play
an important role in explaining why cities form and where they locate within the region.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine exactly which kinds of increasing returns are at work.
14

One source is Marshallian externalities but they must be of localization rather than of urbanization

type. Other important sources are the economies in local public goods and in transportation of
inputs and final goods.
In addition, the fact that the large cities in the New England, Middle Atlantic, and East
North Central regions had a significantly higher proportion of the population engaged in
manufacturing and the fact that the large cities were concentrated in these three regions both
suggest that these regions had an overall regional comparative advantage in manufacturing. The
data in Table 3 show that, in 1880, the large cities in the New England, Middle Atlantic, and East

North Central regions had, respectively, 24.1%, 16.2%, and 14.0% of their populations in
manufacturing whereas the other regions, except for South Atlantic, had less than 10%; in 1920,
the three regions in the manufacturing belt had more than 20% of their population in
manufacturing whereas other regions had less than 14%. The data in Table 4 show that the three
regions, New England, Middle Atlantic, and East North Central, contained more than 60% of large
cities between 1880 and 1920.
The second half of the twentieth century has been characterized by a significant shift in

economic activities away from manufacturing into services. In the early part of the century, the
percentage of the population employed in services and in manufacturing was relatively even in

large cities. However, by the late twentieth century, the percentage of employment in services
reached almost three times that of manufacturing.22 The growth in the importance of services led to

22 Between 1920 and 1990, the average percentage of the population employed in manufacturing in
large cities fell from 18% to 9.5% whereas the percentage in services rose from 20.0% to 27.3%. The data
on manufacturing employment are from the Census of Manufaci'ures, but the data on services come from
two different sources. The 1920 service employment is from the labor force data in the Census of
Population whereas the 1990 data are from the Census of Services. The labor force data from the Census

significant changes in the nature and scope of trade. Services, unlike manufacturing, involve little
physical trade in final goods and raw materials. While trade in services may benefit from economies
in the communication infrastructure, it is unlikely to derive much benefit from physical economies

in transportation. In addition, during this period, further developments in manufacturing lowered
the physical economies of transportation as electricity replaced coal as the dominant form of final
energy, as raw material intensities and plant sizes of manufacturing fell, and as products became
significantly lighter. These developments had a significant impact on the pace and pattern of U.S.
urban development in the second half of the twentieth century.

The changes in the economic structures of cities and in the economies of inter- and intraurban transportation modes altered the relative growth rates of cities of different size classes since
the mid-twentieth century. In the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries, significant
economies in both inter- and intra-urban transportation led to the concentration of population in

very large cities. The large scale economies and production intensity in relatively immobile
resources, in conjunction with existing water and railroad transportation modes, led to significant
economies of scale in transportation.24 Moreover, intra-urban transportation based on trolleys and

of Population for the entire economy indicate that the percentage of population engaged in services was
13.0% in 1920 and rose to 33.9% in 1990.
23 Moses and Williamson (1967) argue that the physical form of cities during this period was influenced
significantly by the inter- and intra-urban transportation modes.
24 Although there is little evidence for economies of scale at the firm level, most studies indicate
significant increasing returns in traffic density in railroad transportation. Most estimates of returns to
density are between 1.76 and 1.92. See Kecler (1983, 57) and Caves, Christensen, Tretheway, and Windle
(1985, 112). Studies indicate that there are moderate scale economies in the provision of local public
goods. Most studies indicate that scale economies in police protection, fire protection and schools occur up
to a population of about 100,000. Scale economies in the provision of water and sewage services are likely
to be some what higher. See Hirsch (1959), Hines (1969), and Waizer (1972).
16

electric rail was also subject to significant economies in commuting. Since the mid-twentieth
century, as services became more important, economies in inter-urban transportation fell.25

Moreover, the increase in consumption of certain types of services such as housing and retail
goods and the rise of automobiles as the dominant form of commuting led to a decline in the
density of cities.26 This decline was not only accounted for by a fall in density of older cities as they

became more suburban, but also by the addition of new cities which were less dense than the
existing ones.

The growing importance of services and other developments in the manufacturing sector
greatly altered the geographic location of cities. The concentration of large cities in the second half
of the twentieth century shifted away from the New England, Middle Atlantic and East North

Central regions to the Southwestern regions of the United States. The geographic redistribution of
large cities was caused by the decreased importance of comparative advantage in resources of the
manufacturing belt. As services became an increasingly dominant portion of city economies and as
factors in manufacturing became more mobile over time, geographic differences in factor
endowments diminished across the U.S. regions.27 Consequently, between 1920 and 1990, the

percentage of large cities in the New England, Middle Atlantic, and East North Central regions fell
25 The economies in inter-urban transportation also fell as scale economies in manufacturing fell, as
manufacturing became less intensive in resources, and as transportation modes shifted to trucks and
airplanes.

26 See Mieszkowski and Mills (1993) and Margo (1992) for explanations concerning the rise of
suburbanization.
27 Kim (1995) documents that regional industrial structures in manufacturing converged over the
second half of the twentieth century. Kim (1998) shows that the convergence in industrial structures is even
more dramatic when services are included. While, due to disclosure laws, it is difficult to construct
accurate industrial structures of many major cities in the second half of the twentieth century, it is highly
unlikely that a city's industrial structure strayed significantly from that of its region.

Pacific regions rose from 15% to 50%.

IV. Explaining the Size Distribution of U.S. Cities, 1900-1990.
This section explores whether cities of different sizes possess different economic and social
structures. The analysis of the economic structures of cities by size distribution is based on samples

of large U.S. cities between 1900 and 1990. In 1900, data were available for cities with 25,000 or
more inhabitants; in 1920, 1940, and 1990, the threshold levels were 50,000, 100,000 and 100,000
inhabitants, respectively. Data on cities were derived from a variety of sources: the Censusof
Population, 1900-1990; Census of Manufactures, 1900-1987; Census of Business, 1940-1987;

Census of Services, 1990, and County and City Data Book, 1994.
The dependent variables in each of the cross-sectional regressions are the log of
population, population, city rank, and city density. The set of independent variables differ from

year to year as the occupational structure has become more refined over time. Although not
available for all years, they include the percentage of foreign-born, black, and educated, and the
percentage of employment in agriculture, mining, manufacturing, wholesale trade, retail trade,

transportation, FIRE, business services, personal services, amusement, professional services and
government as a percentage of total population.
Some simple descriptive statistics of these variables are presented in Table 9. The mean

population of large cities was 123,000, 228,300, 413,000, and 326,000 in 1900, 1920, 1940, and
1990 respectively. The density of cities in the sample rose slightly from 7,377 to 8461 persons per

square mile between 1900 and 1920, but then declined significantly to 4,233 persons per square
mile in 1990. The percentage of the foreign born population in large cities was almost 21% in
18

1900, but declined steadily to about 11% in 1990. On the other hand, the percentage of the black
population in large cities was less than 10% before 1940, but then rose to 18.6% in 1990. The
average percentage of population engaged in manufacturing in cities fell from 17.1% to 9.3%

whereas the percentage in services rose from 20.0% to 27.3% between 1900 and 1990.
The regression results in Table 10 show that large cities differed from smaller cities in many

ways. Large cities consistently had a greater proportion of their population in transaction
services.28 In 1900 and 1920, a standard deviation increase in the percentage of the population

engaged in trade related activities is associated with a more than 40% increase in city population
and an increase in the size ranking of cities by 25 places. In addition, in 1920, a standard deviation
increase in clerical workers also led to an increase in population by 35% and a rise in rank of about

20 places. In 1940, standard deviation increases in the percentage of population engaged in
wholesale trade and business services increased the population by 34% (10 places in rank) and
54% (16 places in rank) respectively. While still significantly positive, the influence of transaction

services declined somewhat in 1990. In that year, business and legal services were significant, but
wholesale trade was significant only when these variables, due to problems of multicollinearity,
were excluded from the regression.
The size of cities was significantly correlated with demographic variables on immigrants

and blacks. While the relationship between the foreign-born and city size has weakened over time,

the correlation between city size and the percentage of black population has strengthened. City size
was significantly correlated with the foreign born population in 1900, 1920, and 1940, but became
insignificant in 1990. Except for 1900, the foreign-born resided in dense cities. City size, except for
28

and North (1986) for a definition of transaction services.
19

dense cities in 1920, did not correlate with the proportion of the black population for most years,
but became significantly correlated in 1990.

The larger cities also had a greater proportion of their populations in government and
amusement activities in 1940 and 1990. However, most other economic variables showed negative
or little correlation with city size. Since agricultural activity requires large amounts of land relative

to population, it is not surprising that it was negatively correlated with city size and city density for
most years for which data exist. The transportation variable was positively correlated with dense
cities in 1920, but was negatively correlated with population size in 1940. The level of education,
proxied in different years by illiteracy rates, median years of schooling, or graduation rates of high

school or greater, tended to correlate negatively with city size but the relationship was rarely
significant.

The data appear to support the hypothesis that the size distribution of cities is explained by
the concentration of transaction services in the higher-ranked cities. However, the data seem to
reject two other popular theories. City sizes were not correlated with retail nor manufacturing
activities. Contrary to the predictions of the central place theory based on economies in retail
trade, the data indicate that smaller cities had a greater percentage of their population engaged in
retail trade. For example, in 1940 and 1990, a standard deviation increase in the percentage of the
population engaged in retail trade was associated with a 10% and 23% decline in city population
respectively. Data also indicate little correlation between city size and manufacturing activities. For

most years, the percentage of the population engaged in manufacturing was unrelated to city sizes
and in 1990, the relationship was significantly negative.

20

V. Conclusion.

This paper has attempted to document the long-run pace and pattern of U.S. urban
development and to shed some light on the forces which produced them. The data indicate that
there were two significant turning points in the history of U.S. urban development. The first
turning point coincided with a shift from an agricultural to a manufacturing economy between the
late nineteenth and the turn of the twentieth centuries and the second coincided with a shift toward
a service economy in the mid-twentieth century. This paper suggests that the historical pace and
pattern of U.S. urban development are adequately explained by changes in regional comparative

advantage and economies in transportation and local public goods which in turn were determined
by the changes in the structure of the economy.

Throughout the history of U.S. urban development, cities exhibited considerable variation
in their sizes because the larger cities lowered the costs of market transactions. When markets
were still relatively small, the larger cities lowered the cost of coordinating supply and demand by

concentrating in one location merchants, newspapers, trade journals, and insurance firms, and
developing auction markets. As the size of markets grew, the development of organized exchanges
and the concentration of specialized merchants continued to perform similar functions.29 However,

the geographic area serviced by the very largest cities grew as merchants in these cities
coordinated the national and international supply and demand of goods. These very largest cities
exhibited considerable persistence in their rankings over time. On the other hand, the fortunes of

29

For example, in the case of the grain market, the establishment of the Chicago Board of Trade, which
had significant powers of inspection, certification and enforcement of contracts, significantly lowered the
costs of market transactions. The standardization of grades and amounts in grain, the acceptance of bills of
lading and warehouse receipts as negotiable instruments of title, and futures contracts enabled Chicago to
transact a significant amount of grain at a very low cost to buyers and sellers (see Cronon (1991, 123)).

21

medium to large cities, which serviced their regional markets, depended a great deal on the
fortunes of their regional economies and exhibited considerable movements in their rankings over
time.

In recent years, the most significant trend in economic geography has been the general
dispersal of economic activities. Since the middle of the twentieth century, there has been a
significant decline in specialization and localization of industries at the regional level. The

convergence in regional industrial structures has also been accompanied by convergence in

regional income per capita. From an urban standpoint, the trend toward population dispersion
began much earlier. The introduction of more efficient intra-city transportation modes such as
street railways allowed the population density to fall in the central cities as residences radiated

outwards. However, since the middle of the twentieth century, the pace of spatial dispersion in
cities increased significantly. The growth of low-density, so-called edge-cities, has significantly
changed the American urban landscape and its local political jurisdictions. The study of the long-

run trends in U.S. urban development suggests that the persistence of this trend is likely to depend
upon future turning points in the structure of the American economy.
