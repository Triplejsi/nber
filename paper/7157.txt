I. Introduction
The starting point of this paper is the observation of Flood, Hodrick, and Kaplan (1986)
that stock returns are predictable. Flood, Hodrick, and Kaplan (1986) argued that one could not
test for bubbles in stock prices without controlling for the rational movements in stock prices that
are caused by fluctuations in expected rates of return. They used annual data and demonstrated
that dividend yields, the ratio of the annual dividend to the current stock price, provided
statistically significant forecasts of future stock returns, especially at the two-year horizon.
Subsequent research by Campbell (1991) and Hodrick (1992) demonstrates that a vector
autoregressive approach with monthly data generates significant time-varying forecasts of stock
returns at any future horizon and has better small-sample properties than the direct long-horizon
approach.
While theories of stock return predictability have been available since Merton (1973), the
links between the theories of stock return predictability and the empirical analysis of this issue
have been weak. 1 The intuition of Merton’s model is that risk-averse consumer-investors want
to hedge against adverse changes in their consumption and investment opportunity sets. Thus,
the cross-section and time-series patterns of expected asset returns are determined by more than
just the covariances of the returns on the assets with the return on the market portfolio, as in the
static capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Expected returns also depend on the covariances of
the returns on the assets with the state variables that describe the consumption and investment
opportunity sets. The generality of this specification provided little basis for a tight econometric
test of Merton’s theory.
Predictability of international equity returns is inconsistent with the static CAPM. Some
researchers, Harvey (1991), Bekaert and Hodrick (1992), and Ferson and Harvey (1993) for

3

example, have characterized the predictability of country returns and developed tests of
conditional CAPM’s in which the conditional expected return on an asset is related to the
conditional expected return on the market portfolio with a conditional, time-varying beta. The
main problem with this approach is that it lacks a sound theoretical foundation.

Once the

conditional distributions are allowed to vary, Merton’s (1973) logic indicates that additional
hedge portfolios, other than the market, may be priced. This paper develops a formal test of an
international, intertemporal, asset-pricing model in which state variables may be priced.
Our analysis builds on the work of Campbell (1993, 1996).

The failure of the

consumption-based, asset-pricing literature of the 1980’s motivated Campbell (1993) to develop
a theoretical model that avoids direct measurements of consumption. Campbell (1996) extended
this theoretical model and generated empirically testable specifications directly linking the crosssection of expected stock returns to time variation in expected returns on the market portfolio.
Campbell (1996) applied his model to a cross-section of returns on 25 portfolios of U.S. stocks
taking the value-weighted U.S. market return as the market portfolio. 2 While the theory was
marginally rejected, the pricing errors of the model were small on most portfolios. Most of the
explanatory power of the model was in the market portfolio, as is predicted by the CAPM.
The purpose of this paper is to determine whether variation in expected returns on the
world market portfolio induces significant hedging motives, which are reflected in average
returns across countries. We extend Campbell’s (1996) model to an international environment,
and we utilize recent evidence of Lamont (1998) to specify the state variables in the forecasting
equation.
Our analysis is effectively a constrained arbitrage-pricing model. Korajczyk and Viallet
(1989) and Ferson and Harvey (1993) have tested multi-factor, international, arbitrage-pricing

4

models. The problem with these specifications is that one must pre-specify the identity and
number of factors with little theoretical guidance. Our framework imposes the restriction that
the factors affecting the cross-sectional asset pricing must be those that forecast market returns.
As with many studies of international asset pricing, we assume that national equity
markets are integrated, with no barriers to investment, transaction costs or differential taxes. We
will also assume a representative agent framework, which raises the issue of aggregation across
countries and the failure of purchasing power parity, see Adler and Dumas (1983).
Section II provides a review of Campbell’s (1996) model. Section III describes the data.
Section IV discusses forecasting of real and excess nominal stock returns and compares the
results of our analysis with Lamont’s (1998) analysis. Section V discusses the econometric
aspects of the asset-pricing model, while section VI provides the estimation and testing of the
model. Section VII contains concluding remarks.

II. A Review of Campbell’s (1996) Model
Campbell’s (1996) model uses a representative agent framework, and hence, it shares the
weaknesses of the consumption CAPM and Euler equation methods that were developed in the
1980’s to test intertemporal asset-pricing models. 3 Nevertheless, there is an advantage to the
approach because Campbell uses log-linearization to eliminate observations on consumption
from the asset-pricing model.

Ultimately, the model relates expected returns on assets to

covariances of returns with the market portfolio, as in the traditional static CAPM, and to
covariances of returns with changes in the expected future returns on the market portfolio. 4
The representative agent’s budget constraint is written in real terms as
Wt +1 = Rm ,t +1 (Wt − Ct ),

5

(1)

where Wt is real wealth, Ct is real consumption, and Rm,t+1 is the gross return on aggregate
wealth, which is the return on the market portfolio.
Campbell (1996) divides equation (1) by Wt and log-linearizes the resulting expression in
a first-order Taylor approximation around the mean log consumption-wealth ratio, c – w. The
result is
∆wt +1 = rm ,t +1 + k w + (1 − (1 / ρ))( ct − wt ),

(2)

where lower case letters are natural logarithms of upper case counterparts, ρ / 1 – exp(c – w),
and k w is a constant.
When the log consumption-wealth ratio is stationary, equation (2) implies that the
innovation in logarithm of consumption can be written as the innovation in the discounted
present value of the return on the market minus the innovation in the discounted present value of
consumption growth:
∞

c t +1 − Et ct +1 = ( Et +1 − Et ) ∑ ρ j rm ,t +1 + j
j =0
∞

− ( Et +1 − Et )∑ ρ ∆ct +1 + j

(3)

j

j =1

Equation (3) indicates that an unanticipated increase in consumption today must be due to an
innovation in the return on wealth, either today or an expected increase in the future, or it must
coincide with a planned reduction in the growth rate of consumption in the future.
Campbell (1993, 1996) next uses a log-linear Euler equation to eliminate expected future
consumption growth from the right-hand side of equation (3). The consumer’s preferences are
modeled as in Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1989) with separate parameters for the
coefficient of relative risk aversion, γ, and for the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, F. The
objective function is defined recursively by

6

U t = [(1 − β )Ct(1 −γ ) / θ + β ( E tU t(+11−γ ) )1 / θ ]θ /(1 −γ ) ,

(4)

where 2 / (1 - ()/[1 – (1/F)]. Campbell (1996) notes that θ can have either sign, θ → 0 as γ →
1, θ → 4 as σ → 1, and θ → 1 as γ → 1/σ.
Epstein and Zin (1989) solve for the Euler equations associated with maximizing
equation (4) subject to the budget constraint given in (1). When asset returns are conditionally
homoskedastic and log-normally distributed, the Euler equations may be written in log-linear
form as
Et ∆ct +1 = µm + σEt rm ,t +1

(5)

and
Et ri ,t +1 − r f ,t +1 +

Vii
V
= θ ic + (1 − θ )Vim .
2
σ

(6)

In equation (6), rf,t+1 is the riskless real interest rate, Vii = var(ri,t+1 - Etri,t+1 ), Vic = cov(ri,t+1 Etri,t+1 , ct+1 - Etct+1 ), and Vim = cov(ri,t+1 - Etri,t+1 , rm,t+1 - Etrm,t+1 ).
Equation (5) indicates that consumption growth is linearly related to the expected return
on the market portfolio, and this fact is used in conjunction with the linearized budget constraint
to eliminate consumption from the asset-pricing model.

Equation (6) indicates that the

continuously compounded risk premium on an asset plus one-half of the asset’s variance is
determined by the covariances of the asset’s return with consumption and with the return on the
market.
By substituting equation (5) into equation (3), Campbell (1996) derives
∞

c t +1 − Et ct +1 = rm ,t +1 − Et rm , t +1 + (1 − σ )( E t +1 − Et ) ∑ ρ j rm ,t +1 + j .

(7)

j =1

Equation (7) indicates that the innovation in consumption, which enters the asset-pricing
equation (6), can be eliminated by focusing on the innovations in the return on the market
7

portfolio and in the discounted expected future returns. Intuitively, consumption responds onefor-one to the current return on the market portfolio because the objective function is
homogeneous of degree one. The response of an innovation in consumption to an innovation in
expected future returns depends on income and substitution effects. When the elasticity of
substitution, F, is less than one, the income effect dominates causing current consumption to rise.
When F is greater than one, the substitution effect dominates; and current consumption falls.
By substituting from equation (7) into the asset-pricing equation (6), we find
cov( ri ,t +1 − E t ri ,t +1 , ct +1 − E t ct +1 ) ≡ Vic = Vim + (1 − σ )Vih ,

(8)

where Vih ≡ cov[ ri ,t +1 − Et ri ,t +1 , ( E t +1 − Et ) ∑ j =1 ρ j rm ,t +1 + j ] , which is the covariance of the return on
∞

an asset with the revision in expectations about discounted future market returns.
After substituting equation (8) into equation (6) and using the definition of 2, the assetpricing equations become
Et ri ,t +1 − r f , t +1 +

Vii
= γVim + (γ − 1)Vih .
2

(9)

Equation (9) demonstrates that an asset’s risk premium (adjusted for one-half its own variance)
depends on the asset’s covariance with the market portfolio, with weight (, and on its covariance
with the innovation in discounted expected future market returns, with weight (( - 1).
The coefficient of relative risk aversion determines the compensation that investors
demand for covariance risks. When ( = 1, the model’s predictions coincide with those of the
static CAPM. When ( > (<) 1, investors require higher (lower) expected returns on assets that
covary positively with innovations in discounted expected future returns. Campbell (1996) notes
that a positive covariance carries a mixed blessing. On the one hand, investors like assets that
have good payoffs when expected future returns are high. But, on the other hand, investors

8

dislike the fact that such assets provide poor hedging against deterioration in future investment
opportunities. When ( is greater than one, the latter effect dominates the former.
While the derivation of equation (9) follows Campbell (1996) in assuming conditional
homoskedasticity, Campbell (1993) discusses several conditions under which such an equation
can be derived in a more realistic environment of conditional heteroskedasticity. 5 The most
straightforward approach is to assume that the elasticity of substitution, F, equals one. In this
case, equation (9) holds in terms of conditional expected returns with all second moments
replaced by conditional second moments.

Below, we derive and test the unconditional

implications of such a specification. 6

III. The Data
Table 1 presents some summary statistics for the primary data set that will be used in our
study. We use monthly data from 1970:1 to 1998:4. The first variable is the real return on the
MSCI world market portfolio (RRET). The units are percent per month, so the mean return of
0.546% corresponds to an annualized value of 6.55%. The next four variables are the additional
state variables that are the predictors of real returns. The first is the logarithm of the annualized
payout-ratio of world dividends relative to world earnings (LOGDE).

The second is the

logarithm of the annualized world dividend-price ratio (LOGDP). The third is the relative bill
rate (RREL), which is the one-month U.S. interest rate minus its previous twelve-month moving
average, in percent per month. The fourth variable is the Treasury bond term spread (TSPD)
between the 30-year U.S. interest rate and the one-year U.S. interest rate, in percent per month.
The next seven variables in Table 1 are the dollar rates of return on the MSCI G7 country
portfolios in excess of the one-month U.S. Treasury bill rate of return. The countries are the
United States (US), Japan (JP), Germany (GE), the United Kingdom (UK), France (FR), Canada

9

(CA), and Italy (IT). These variables are also measured as percent per month. The mean excess
rates of return range from Italy’s 1.056% per annum to the U.K.’s 6.732% per annum. The U.S.
has the lowest standard deviation, and Italy has the highest.

IV. The Forecasting Model
The first task in developing testable restrictions from equation (9) is to determine that the
real return on the world equity market portfolio is forecastable. Since the theoretical model
requires multi-period forecasts of the equity return, it is useful to stack the equity return as the
first element of a k-dimensional vector of state variables, zt , and use a vector autoregression
(VAR) as in the following:
z t +1 = Az t + εt +1 .

(10)

The representation of the VAR as a first-order system is not restrictive, as the variables can
always be stacked into a first-order companion form. We report the results of the first-order
specification as this is the order chosen by the Schwarz (1978) criterion.
Panel A of Table 2 presents a five-variable, first-order vector autoregression. The first
variable is the real return on the MSCI world market portfolio (RRET). The other four variables
are the payout ratio, LOGDE; the dividend yield, LOGDP; the relative bill rate, RREL; and the
term spread, TSPD. We use RREL and TSPD because we are pricing the excess dollar returns
on the G7 equities.
Lamont (1998) finds that the payout ratio is an important predictor of the U.S. S&P 500
excess return. Rozeff (1984), Campbell and Shiller (1988), Fama and French (1988), and Flood,
Hodrick and Kaplan (1986) emphasize the importance of the dividend yield in forecasting stock
returns at short and long horizons. Campbell (1991) and Hodrick (1992) use the relative bill rate.

10

Fama and French (1989) find that the term structure of interest rates predicts stock and bond
returns.
For the return forecasting equation, the value of the chi-square statistic with five degrees
of freedom is 15.56, which indicates that real equity returns are predictable at standard levels of
statistical significance. Nevertheless, the adjusted R2 for the real return equation is only 3.3%.
This pattern of strong statistical significance with low percentage predictability is to be expected
in monthly data. In efficient markets, most of the observed return will be unexpected, unless
economic agents are extremely risk averse.
The most important features of the other forecasting equations are the coefficients on the
own lags, which indicate that there is strong positive serial correlation in the log payout ratio, the
log dividend-price ratio, and the term premium. There are also important off-diagonal terms
indicating significant dynamics between the dividend yield, the payout ratio, the relative bill rate,
and the term spread.
Panel A of Table 2 also reports the Cumby-Huizinga (1992) L-tests for residual serial
correlation of the first eight lags in each equation. Except for the relative bill rate equation, a
first-order VAR appears to be a good approximation to the data-generating process.
Panel B of Table 2 reports unconstrained excess return forecasting equations for the G7
countries. Here again, the evidence for predictability of the excess returns is not overwhelmingly
strong. These equations are provided as a comparison to the constrained equations that will enter
the asset-pricing model.
Table 3 reports the covariances and correlations of the innovations in the VAR. The
correlations are in bold above the diagonal. The innovation variance of the real stock return is
much larger than the other innovation variances, and the innovation in the real stock return is

11

highly negatively correlated with the innovation in the log dividend yield. The log dividend
yield is positively correlated with the log payout ratio and the relative bill rate.
Our results on the predictability of returns present a striking contrast to those of Lamont
(1998). We explore these differences in Table 4, which adopts a quarterly measurement interval
for comparison purposes. 7 Lamont (1998) forecasts the excess nominal return on the S&P 500
and reports a significantly higher R2 for the sample period 1947:Q1 to 1994:Q4.

We use

Lamont’s (1998) data and our programs to produce the first line of Table 4, which coincides with
the first line of Lamont’s (1998) Table VI. Aside from the higher R2 in the return equation,
Lamont (1998) also reports that the dividend-payout ratio positively forecasts returns, which he
interprets as a business-cycle effect. The argument is that the payout ratio is countercyclical as
earnings fluctuate more than dividends across business cycles.

Since expected returns are

thought to be countercyclical, being higher in recessions than in booms, the coefficient linking
the payout ratio to returns should be positive. Line 2 of Table 4 demonstrates that this effect
persists in Lamont’s data for the sample period 1970:Q2 to 1994:Q4, which is the part that
overlaps most with our sample.

Line 3 of Table 4 demonstrates that the effects are not

diminished by the inclusion of the term spread in the regression. Line 4 of Table 4 presents an
analogous regression to line 3, but the data are changed. Line 4 uses the excess nominal return
on the MSCI-US portfolio, which has a correlation of .997 with the S&P 500 return, and
employs the associated MSCI-US dividend and earning series. LOGDE loses significance, and
its sign changes from positive to negative. The R2 for the return equation also falls from .12 to
.06. Line 5 of Table 4 demonstrates that extending the sample to 1998:2 causes the dividend
yield to lose significance.

The last line of Table 4 presents the forecasting regression for the

12

MSCI-World excess nominal return, which is similar to the forecasting equation for the real
return in Table 1.
Innovations in Forecasts of Future Stock Returns
The next step in the analysis is to calculate the innovation in the discounted expected future stock
returns, since this is the other factor in the asset-pricing framework. To generate the innovation
in the discounted present value of the market equity returns from the VAR, define the kdimensional indicator vector e1, whose first element is one and whose other elements are zero.
Because Et zt + j = A j z t , the innovation in the discounted expected future value of the stock
market returns is
∞

∞

j =1

j =1

( Et +1 − Et ) ∑ ρ j rm ,t +1 + j = e1′∑ ρ j A j εt +1
= e1′ ρA( I − ρA) −1 ε t +1
= λh′εt +1 .

(11)

The last line of equation (11) defines the vector 8h to be a nonlinear function of the VAR
coefficients equal to e1NDA(I - DA)-1. The subscript h is used to identify this coefficient with the
hedging demands of investors.
The differences in the variances of the innovations and the correlations between
innovations make it hard to interpret the estimation results for a VAR factor model unless the
factors are orthogonalized and scaled in some way. To deal with this problem, Campbell (1996)
employs Sims’s (1980) triangular orthogonalization of the innovations.

He also scales the

innovations such that they have the same variance as the innovation to the real return. We adopt
a similar procedure. Thus, the orthogonalized innovation in the real return is unaffected, and the
orthogonalized innovation in the payout ratio is the component of the payout ratio that is
orthogonal to the real return.

The orthogonalized innovation in the dividend yield is the

13

component of the dividend yield that is orthogonal to the real return and the payout ratio, etc.
Since fluctuations in the payout ratio are dominated by fluctuations in earnings, the
orthogonalized innovation is essentially an earnings shock that is uncorrelated with returns. The
orthogonalized innovation in the dividend yield becomes a dividend shock, and the innovations
in the relative bill rate and the term premium become shocks to short-term and long-term interest
rates that are orthogonal to returns, earnings and dividends.
Table 5 reports the coefficients of 8h for the raw innovations and for the orthogonalized
innovations using a D = 0.9949. Asymptotic standard errors are reported in parentheses under
the coefficients. We find that shocks to the dividend yield, the relative bill rate, and the term
premium have positive influences on the innovation in discounted expected future returns, while
the innovation in the stock return and the payout ratio have a negative effect. Although none of
the coefficients is particularly large relative to its standard error, the P2 (5) statistic that tests
whether all five coefficients are zero is 10.940, which has a p-value of .053. Hence, the group of
variables as a whole does have some predictive power.
Campbell (1996) notes that the coefficient on the orthogonalized innovation to the real
return in the 8h vector represents the percent of an innovation in returns that is expected to be
reversed over the long run.

Our point estimate implies considerably less reversion in

international stock returns than Campbell finds in post-war U.S. data. Our coefficient is -0.23,
whereas Campbell reports a coefficient of -0.92. We also find somewhat different results on the
importance of the term premium.

Here, we find a coefficient on the orthogonalized term

premium of 0.65 while Campbell reports 0.21. Since the scale of the orthogonalized variables is
quite similar because our variance is 16.42 versus Campbell’s 17.04, fluctuations in the term

14

premium are much more important for the international equity markets than for the U.S.
domestic market.
Panel B of Table 5 reports the covariances and correlations of the two sources of risk in
the asset-pricing model, e1Nε t+1 and 8h Nεt+1 . We find that innovations to discounted expected
future real returns are slightly more than half as variable as innovations to current returns,
whereas Campbell (1996) finds them to be approximately equal, and we find a correlation
between the two factors of -.324, whereas Campbell’s is -.915. The decline in the correlation
between e1Nε t+1 and 8h Nεt+1 may be due to the decline in the importance of the dividend yield in
predicting future stock returns.

V. The Econometric Asset-Pricing Model
The next task is to develop the econometric specification to test the asset-pricing model.
We use Hansen’s (1982) generalized method of moments (GMM), which requires that the
econometrician define a set of orthogonality conditions specified by the theoretical model.
Three basic sets of orthogonality conditions are used. The first set is derived from the
requirements that the errors in the VAR equations are required to be orthogonal to the righthand-side forecasting variables:
Et [ε t +1 ⊗ (1, z ′t )′] = 0.

(12)

The second set of orthogonality conditions involves the equations that define the
innovations in the excess country returns. Here, as in Panel B of Table 1, the excess rate of
return for country i at time t+1 is projected onto the same information set, (1, zt N), that is used to
forecast the real return on the world market portfolio:
ri , t +1 − r f ,t +1 = µi + δ i′z t + ηi , t +1 .
Thus, the orthogonality conditions for the i-th country excess rate of return are

15

(13)

Et [ηi ,t +1 ⊗ (1, z ′t ) ′] = 0.

(14)

The third set of orthogonality conditions involves the asset-pricing equations. Since the
asset-pricing equations are written in terms of conditional expectations at time t, and the
innovations to the first two sets of orthogonality conditions are defined above, the asset-pricing
equations (9) can be written as
Etηi2,t +1
Et ri ,t +1 − r f ,t +1 +
= γEt (ηi , t +1e1′ε t +1 ) + (γ − 1) Et (ηi ,t +1 λh′ε t +1 ).
2

(15)

By substituting for the expected return and using realizations for conditional expectations, we
can define the innovation in the i-th asset-pricing equation relative to the time t information set
as
ui ,t +1 = µi + δi′z t +

ηi2, t +1
− γ (ηi ,t +1 e1′ε t +1 ) − (γ − 1)(ηi ,t +1 λh′ε t +1 ).
2

(16)

In the first set of empirical results, we only impose the orthogonality conditions
E (ut +1 ) = 0,

(17)

where ut+1 is the vector of the ui,t+1 ’s. We do not impose additional restrictions because all of the
orthogonality conditions of the model must be estimated simultaneously.
With seven country returns and five forecasting variables, there are thirty orthogonality
conditions in the first set, forty-two in the second set, and seven in the third for a total of
seventy-nine. There are also thirty parameters in the first set, forty-two in the second, and one in
the third for a total of seventy-three parameters. Thus, the entire system of equations has six
more orthogonality conditions than parameters, and the test of the overidentifying restrictions of
the model is a P2 (6).

16

VI. Estimation of the Model
Table 6 reports the seventy-three parameter estimates of the model associated with the
VAR forecasting equations, the G7 excess-return forecasting equations, and the asset-pricing
equations, as well as the constrained prices of risks. As might be expected, there is little change
in the parameters of the VAR forecasting equations or the excess return forecasting equations
relative to their respective unconstrained estimates that are reported in Table 1.

The key

parameter of the model is the coefficient of relative risk aversion, (. Its estimated value is 5.06,
with a standard error of 2.54. Often, in the consumption-based asset-pricing literature and in
Campbell (1996), the estimated coefficients of relative risk aversion are implausibly large, but
our value is quite reasonable.
The overidentifying restrictions of our model are not rejected, since the P2 (6) statistic has
a value of 1.23, which corresponds to a p-value of 0.975. Thus, Campbell’s dynamic assetpricing model explains the cross-section of the G7 country equity returns. When we estimate the
model without imposing the constraint that the coefficient on Vih is (( - 1), the estimated value of
the coefficient is 3.056 with a standard error of 12.330. The resulting chi-squared test that the
coefficient on Vih equals the coefficient on Vim minus one has a value of 0.004. The fact that the
coefficient on Vih is insignificantly different from zero suggests that more restricted models may
adequately represent the data.
Test of Restricted Models
There are several conditions that allow the predictions of the dynamic model to collapse
to the predictions of the CAPM. This section investigates whether we can reject these conditions
or not.

17

The first way that the dynamic model reduces to the CAPM is if ( = 1, since then
expected returns are determined only by the covariance of an asset with the market portfolio. A
GMM likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis that ( = 1 involves estimation of the model under
this restriction with the same GMM weighting matrix as is used without the restriction. The
difference in the values of the criterion functions is a P2 (1) = 4.512, which coincides with a pvalue of .033 indicating that it is unlikely that ( = 1.
The second way that the model reduces to the CAPM is if the covariances of the asset
returns with the hedge portfolio are all zero. The test of these restrictions is a P2 (7) = 54.035
with a p-value less than .0001 indicating very strong evidence that the covariances with the
hedge portfolios are important in pricing the cross-section of asset returns.
The third way that the dynamic model can be reduced to the CAPM is if each Vih is
proportional to its Vim with the same factor of proportionality. The test of these restrictions is a
P2 (6) = 4.512. Hence, we are unable to reject that the dynamic model collapses to the CAPM for
this set of assets. The importance of the hedge portfolios in the pricing of the assets indicates
that the hedge portfolios might be important in pricing other assets in which the proportionality
does not hold.
Estimated Prices of Risks
The asset-pricing model implies that expected returns on assets adjust to reflect the
covariances of asset returns with the return on the market portfolio and with the other underlying
factors that forecast the market portfolio. These covariances are the asset’s risk characteristics,
and the compensations or prices of the risks are constrained by the model. The price of risk that
arises from the traditional covariance of an asset’s return with the market return is ( + (( - 1)8h1 ,
where 8hk represents the k-th element of 8h . The price of the k-th risk that arises from the

18

covariance of an asset’s return with the innovation in a variable that forecasts the market return is
(( - 1)8hk . Thus, this model provides a clear link between the coefficient of relative risk
aversion, (, and the prices of risks that arise from covariances between asset returns and various
factors.
The prices of risks are given in Panel C of Table 6 for the orthogonalized innovations.
The covariance of a return with the return on the market portfolio indeed commands the largest
price of risk, which justifies the important role of this variable in the traditional CAPM. The
estimated price the risk caused by covariance of the return with the market return is 4.065 with a
standard error of 1.541. The covariance of a return with the term premium also incurs a large
price of risk, a value of 2.411 with a standard error of 1.834. The prices of other covariance risks
are an order of magnitude smaller than these coefficients and have standard errors larger than the
coefficients. The results for the prices of risks for the market return and the term premium are
comparable to those estimated by Campbell (1996), but he finds much larger prices of risks for
the dividend yield and the relative bill rate. These findings are consistent with Korajczyk and
Viallet (1989) and Ferson and Harvey (1993) who also find significant risk prices for factors
other than the risk generated by covariance with the return on the international market portfolio.
It is also possible to estimate unconstrained prices of risks. That is, the asset-pricing
model is simply postulated to be
Et ri ,t +1 − r f ,t +1

5
Etηi2,t +1

= ∑ π k Et (ηi ,t +1ε k ,t +1 ),
2
k =1

(18)

where the Bk parameters represent the five unconstrained prices of risks associated with
covariances between the asset returns and the innovations in the factors that forecast the market
return. This specification is essentially a five-factor asset-pricing model as in Ross’s (1976)
arbitrage pricing theory (APT). Table 7 presents the estimated parameters of this model, and the
19

unconstrained prices of risk are given at the bottom. Compared to the results of the constrained
model, there is a slight reduction in the price of risk associated with the covariance of an asset’s
return with the real return on the world market portfolio. There are large changes in the prices of
the other covariance risks, which are also very imprecisely estimated. Because this model uses
the same orthogonality conditions as the constrained model and estimates four additional
parameters, the overidentifying restrictions of this unconstrained model also are not rejected.
The P2 (2) statistic has a value of 0.133, which corresponds to a P-value of 0.936.
Pricing Errors from the Dynamic Model
Table 8 provides the average adjusted excess rates of return for the seven country
portfolios for two samples, which have units of percent per month. The first is our base sample
of 1970:01 to 1998:04. The second is a sub-sample from 1975:01 to 1995:12, which corresponds
to the Fama-French (1998) sample. The average adjusted return corresponds to

where the estimated residuals are used. This is simply the average risk premium, which is
adjusted for the Jensen’s inequality effect that arises because we are using log returns instead of
gross returns. The dynamic pricing model predicts that the average adjusted return contains two
parts: a part corresponding to risk induced by covariance with the world market portfolio, (Vi,m,
and a part corresponding to risk induced by covariance with the innovation in discounted
expected future returns, (( - 1)Vi,h. The model does very well at pricing the average adjusted
returns. The pricing error for the U.S. is only 0.001 percent per month or 0.012 percent per
annum. The Canadian pricing error is the largest at –0.045 percent per month for the basic

20

sample or –0.54 percent per annum. The pricing errors are even smaller, in general, for the
Fama-French (1998) sub-sample.
Since the estimates of Vi,h are uniformly negative, each equity return covaries negatively
with the innovation in discounted expected future market returns. As we noted above, when ( >
1, investors view such negative covariation as desirable for hedging purposes. Hence, these
terms contribute negatively to the assets’ required rates of return.
CAPM Specification Tests
Our inability to reject the restrictions of the CAPM and the imprecision in the estimates
of the unconstrained prices of risks, for the factors other than the market portfolio, suggest that
the traditional CAPM may be an adequate representation of the expected returns on the seven
country portfolios in the sense of having comparable pricing errors.

To investigate this

conjecture, we set up the following system of equations:
rm , t +1 = µm + ε m ,t +1
ri ,t +1 − r f , t +1 = µi + ηi , t +1
u i , t +1 = µi +

ηi2, t +1
2

(20)
− γ (ηi , t +1ε m ,t +1 ),

for i = 1, …, 7. The system is estimated by making each of the error terms orthogonal to a
constant. Since there are nine parameters in the system of equations and fifteen orthogonality
conditions, the test of the overidentifying restrictions is a P2 (6).
This version of the CAPM is estimated in Panel A of Table 9. For the full sample, the
estimated value of ( for is 3.776, with a standard error of 1.478. The P2 (6) statistic that tests the
overidentifying restrictions of the model is 1.079, which corresponds to a p-value of 0.982.
Hence, the CAPM is not rejected by the data. The average returns are larger in the sub-sample,
but inference about the validity of the CAPM is similar.

21

The pricing errors of the CAPM for the two samples are given in Panel B of Table 9. The
largest pricing error is again smaller than 0.05 percent per month.
Predictability of returns is generally inconsistent with the CAPM. Only if (=1, or if Vih
is proportional to Vim, does Campbell’s (1996) theory collapse to a conditional CAPM. If the
static CAPM is true, the pricing errors should not be predictable with conditioning information.
We test this predictability restriction by examining the additional orthogonality conditions that
the asset-pricing errors from the CAPM model should be orthogonal to zt . Since there are seven
assets, five elements in zt , and no additional parameters to estimate, we can calculate a P2 (35)
statistic directly from the value of the GMM objective function for these thirty-five orthogonality
conditions. The value of this statistic is 69.553, with a p-value of 0.0005. This indicates
considerable evidence against the static CAPM.
Of course, we also did not require the pricing errors of the dynamic model to be
orthogonal to the zt information set. When we calculate the analogous P2 (35) statistic for these
restrictions on the dynamic model, we find a test statistic of 178.87, with a p-value smaller than
.00001. Thus, the dynamic model also fails this test of dynamic asset pricing.
High Book-to-Market Returns
Fama and French (1998) further demonstrate the inadequacy of the static international
CAPM by constructing portfolios of stocks for each country based on book-to-market ratios. 8
They find that portfolios with high book-to-market (HBM) ratios are particularly troublesome for
the CAPM to price. The average returns on high book-to-market firms are significantly higher
than those predicted by the CAPM. Our version of these results is presented in Table 10, which
excludes Canada because of data availability. Notice that the average adjusted returns on the
HBM portfolios are considerably higher than the returns on the value-weighted MSCI market

22

portfolios, except in the case of Italy. For example, the average adjusted return for the German
HBM portfolio is 0.213 percent per month higher than the German market portfolio. For the
U.K. the incremental value is 0.369. Table 9 indicates that this range is also the magnitude of the
pricing errors from the CAPM, as well. The estimation uses the estimated value of ( from the
analogous sample for the CAPM estimation with the country market portfolios, and the mean
parameters for the HBM return equations are estimated prior to examining the pricing equations.
Table 11 examines whether the dynamic model can successfully price the HBM country
portfolios. The answer here, too, is negative. The pricing errors from the dynamic model are
approximately equal to the pricing errors from the CAPM.

VII. Conclusions
This paper develops the implications of stock-return predictability for cross-sectional
international asset pricing using the framework developed by Campbell (1996). The dynamic
model explains the average returns on the dollar-denominated excess returns on the market
portfolios of the G7 countries quite well, but the static CAPM does also. The hedging terms of
the dynamic model are non-zero, yet we are unable to reject that they are proportional to
covariances with the market portfolio, in which case they have no direct role in the crosssectional international asset pricing.

Because the static CAPM is inconsistent with return

predictability, which exists in the data, our specification tests demonstrate that instrumental
variables can predict the asset-pricing errors from the static CAPM. Unfortunately, these same
specification tests reveal that the dynamic model fails along the same dimensions. Neither
model can price the high book-to-market country portfolios that Fama and French (1998)
construct.

23

A rational explanation of the data requires a bridge between the intertemporal
predictability of international equity returns and the cross-section of asset returns. Harvey
(1991) and Ferson and Harvey (1993) develop an eclectic, empirical approach. Harvey (1991)
postulates a conditional CAPM, and Ferson and Harvey (1993) develop conditional beta-pricing
models in which expected returns equal the sum of several betas times their associated prices of
risks. They allow the betas to vary over time depending on local information, but they require
the prices of risks to vary only with global information. The problem with such approaches is
that they are not tightly linked to theory.
Fama and French (1996) argue that the static CAPM is flawed, but they develop multifactor explanations of the data. In domestic U.S. asset pricing, they allow expected returns to
depend on sensitivities of returns to three factors. The first is the excess return on a broad
market portfolio. The second is the difference between the return on a portfolio of smallcapitalization stocks and the return on a portfolio of large-capitalization stocks. The third is the
difference between the return on a portfolio of high book-to-market stocks and the return on a
portfolio of low book-to-market stocks. For international asset pricing, Fama and French (1998)
use two factors: the excess return on the world market portfolio, and the difference in returns
between the world high and low book-to-market portfolios. Since the Fama-French (1998)
model successfully prices the problematic returns on high book-to-market country portfolios, a
risk-based theoretical explanation for the presence of the second risk factor seems plausible.
But, Fama and French (1998) note that their tests do not cleanly identify the consumptioninvestment state variables that would link their analysis to intertemporal asset-pricing theories.
The Campbell (1996) model provides a tight theoretical framework that allows us to test
the implications of a truly dynamic asset-pricing model of international equity returns. We

24

demonstrate that this particular dynamic model provides only a marginal improvement over the
static CAPM. Our extension of the model to price international assets involves some strong
assumptions. Perhaps the strongest is the assumption of a representative international investor.
Adler and Dumas (1983) note that failure of purchasing power parity implies that an
international representative investor does not exist. They demonstrate that in such a world
expected equity returns depend on hedging terms involving foreign exchange rates. Vassalou
(1997) provides some tests of unconditional restrictions implied by this approach by developing
indexes of exchange rates and inflation rates. She finds support for the pricing of foreign
exchange risk in equity returns. Dumas and Solnik (1995) postulate a version of the AdlerDumas model that allows time-varying world prices of foreign-exchange risk that are postulated
to depend on the conditioning information of the econometrician. They, too, find that
conditioning information is important and that foreign-exchange risk is priced. De Santis and
Gerard (1998) develop tests of the Adler-Dumas model using a conditional approach that
estimates parametric conditional means and covariances. Since there is strong evidence against
purchasing power parity, modifying the model to allow for different real returns in different
countries is an extension that we are pursuing.
Another weakness of our approach is its assumption that the value-weighted real stock
return correctly measures the return on real wealth. Both Jagannathan and Wang (1996) and
Campbell (1996) stress the importance of labor income and human capital in asset pricing.
While Jagannathan and Wang (1996) and Campbell (1996) treat labor income as tradeable in a
domestic asset-pricing context, such an assumption appears untenable in a multicountry model.
Unfortunately, the required extension of the Campbell (1996) model to allow non-traded human
wealth in different countries appears non-trivial.

25

As Flood, Hodrick, and Kaplan (1986) note, asset return predictability is not inconsistent
with rational, maximizing behavior.

Indeed, modern asset-pricing theories link this return

predictability to hedging motives of investors. Different sensitivities of asset returns to the
underlying state variables that generate time-varying market returns cause risk premiums on the
assets to differ. This paper investigates the links between return predictability and the crosssection of country returns. Hedging demands may play a role in cross-sectional asset pricing, but
there are still many puzzles that remain to be investigated.

Panel A contains a five variable VAR in the real return on the MSCI world market portfolio (RRET), the logarithm
of dividends relative to earnings (LOGDE), the logarithm of the dividend-price ratio (LOGDP), the one-month
Treasury bill interest rate minus its twelve-month moving average (RREL), and the 30-year minus one-year

Table 5: Innovations to the Long-Run Stock Return
Panel A reports the coefficients of the vector defining the innovation in the discounted present value of
the future world stock market returns in equation (11). The variables of the VAR are the real return on the
MSCI world market portfolio (RRET), the logarithm of dividends relative to earnings (LOGDE), the
logarithm of the dividend-price ratio (LOGDP), the one-month Treasury bill interest rate minus its
twelve-month moving average (RREL), and the 30-year minus one-year Treasury bond term spread
(TSPD). The sample period is 1970:01 to 1998:04. The P2 (5) test examines whether the five coefficients
are jointly equal to zero. The second set of coefficients is orthogonalized by triangularizing the
innovations and scaling them to have the same variance as the innovation in the real return. Panel B
reports the covariances and correlation (in bold) of the innovation in the real return and the innovation in
the discounted expected future returns.

Endnotes

1

Hodrick (1981) and Stulz (1981) extended the Merton (1973) analysis to develop international,

intertemporal asset pricing models.
2

The model also incorporates human capital as an additional asset.

3

The Euler equation approach of Hansen and Singleton (1982) provided researchers with

econometric tools that allowed tests of models in which expected returns on stocks were allowed
to fluctuate, but the approach requires correct specification of a representative agent’s utility
function and direct observations on the consumption of this agent. Both aspects are problematic.
4

Campbell (1996) also allows for an additional factor in the asset-pricing model related to

human wealth. He argues that the return on the real wealth portfolio is appropriately measured
as the value-weighted sum of the return on assets and the return on human wealth. Jagannathan
and Wang (1996) also include labor income in their analysis. While there may be an assetpricing role for labor income, in a global economy the variable would have to be some measure
of the world’s labor income. We have made no attempt to measure such a variable.
5

Chang and Hung (1999) independently develop an international version of Campbell’s (1996)

model allowing for time-varying conditional second moments.
6

While it is tempting to substitute F = 1 in equation (7) and conclude that intertemporal

considerations are not important in this case, which would imply that equation (9) is wrong, the
correct derivation follows Giovannini and Weil (1989) who note that L’Hopital’s rule must be
applied because θ → 4 as σ → 1.
