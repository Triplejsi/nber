ABSTRACT
The effect of interracial contact in public schools on the enrollment of whites has been an important
concern in assessments of desegregation since the 1970s. It has been feared that “white flight” -- meaning
exit from or avoidance of racially mixed public schools -- could undermine the racial contact that
desegregation policy seeks to enhance. This study examines this question using recent data. It also
expands coverage from large urban districts to entire metropolitan areas, paying attention to the spatial
context within which enrollment decisions are made. To do so, it examines data for 1987 and 1996 on
racial composition and enrollment in all schools and school districts in 238 metropolitan areas. The study
finds that white losses appear to be spurred both by interracial contact in districts where their children
attend school and by the opportunities available in metropolitan areas for reducing that contact.
Implications for metropolitan segregation are examined.

Are Whites Still "Fleeing"? Racial Patterns and Enrollment
Shifts in Urban Public Schools, 1987-1996

Charles T. Clotfelter

In sharp contrast to the firestorm of controversy it generated into the 1 970s, school

desegregation has receded from prominence as a national issue in the last two decades. One
reason for its virtual disappearance has been the Supreme Court's clear resolve to place limits on
aggressive efforts to achieve and maintain racial balance in public schools.1 Yet school

desegregation survives as national policy, and most of the issues that surrounded its

implementation in the 1960s remain important today. Among the most significant issues is what
effect desegregation itself has on the tendency of white and middle class families to leave — or
avoid — racially mixed,

largely urban school districts. Such departures are important, of course,

because they tend to undercut desegregation, to the extent that they result in greater racial
disparities among districts.

The aim of this paper is to examine recent changes in the racial composition and
enrollment levels in urban public schools and, in particular, the factors associated with white

losses. These white losses, sometimes dubbed "white flight," arise not only when white families
move from one district to another or enroll in private schools, but also when they simply avoid

moving into districts with high interracial contact. Utilizing data covering all public schools and
districts in a sample of metropolitan areas, the study assesses trends over the period 1987 to 1996

for all major districts in these metropolitan areas, not just central city districts. It examines
changes in white public school enrollments as well as changes in racial compositions, levels of
interracial contact, and segregation. The data, which are taken from the Department of
Education's Common Core of Data, include the enrollment by race and ethnic group of virtually
every public school in 238 metropolitan areas in both 1987 and 1996.2 In contrast, the
comparable data used in most previous research were collected only for selected districts, making
it necessary to restrict attention to large urban, mostly central city districts.3 The data used in the

current study cover all districts, thus making it feasible to obtain a complete picture of each
metropolitan area's public schools and to examine patterns over time in those metropolitan areas.
Thus it is possible to see if the kinds of patterns observed in the 1960s and 1970s are still

evident, with the maturation of school desegregation as a policy. It is particularly interesting to
trace the effects of recent demographic trends, including significant ethnic shifts arising from

immigration, as well as public policies aimed at fostering integration. It will be important as
well to reflect insofar as possible the tremendous heterogeneity among metropolitan areas — by

size, region, age, number of central cities, and number of school districts. One dimension of
heterogeneity is the physical distance separating districts. Fortunately, the data set's complete
coverage of districts allows one to take into account the geographical proximity of districts to

which whites might consider moving in order to escape high concentrations of nonwhites.
The study addresses two sets of questions. First, it will be useftil to describe recent trends

in enrollment and racial composition. Is the movement of whites out of central cities slowing or
2

accelerating? Are interracial contact and segregation increasing or decreasing? And, is there
evidence that the South, whose previous patterns were deeply influenced by the existence of legal

segregation in schools, is evincing patterns increasingly similar to the North? Second, it is
important to raise again the perennial question of whether and how desegregation contributes to

white enrollment losses. Is there evidence of tipping points in these losses, as previous research
has suggested?4 Do white reactions to interracial contact differ by nonwhite group?
What makes these questions important to ask are the ramifications of racial patterns in

schools for socially significant outcomes. Racial contact in schools may affect such things as the
level and distribution of academic achievement in the population, racial attitudes, subsequent
social and economic outcomes of students, and patterns of residential integration.5 These
important issues, however, are beyond the scope of the present paper.
Section I provides background for the analysis, including a brief review of related

statistical studies. Section II describes the data used and the variables defined in the current
study. Section III presents and discusses regression analysis for a sample of districts, and section
IV examines the implications for changes at the metropolitan level. There is a brief concluding
section.

I. Background
Although the landmark Brown v. Board of Education was handed down in 1954, it was
not until the late 1960s that many Southern school districts had undertaken substantial efforts to
desegregate their schools. But when desegregation did take place, it typically produced dramatic
changes in interracial contact. Between 1968 and 1972 the percentage of black students going to

schools with 90 to 100 percent minority enrollments fell from 78 to 25 percent in the South, by
far the biggest change in any region (Orfield 1983, p. 4). Concomitantly, the exposure of whites
to blacks increased, largely but not exclusively in the South.6 In urban areas this desegregation
often took the form of cross-town busing, a policy that was endorsed by the Supreme Court in its
1971 decision Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg Board of Education.

Research on Desegregation and "White Flight"

One major concern that developed in the wake of this and other federal court decisions
was whether these actions would cause white families to leave desegregating districts, thereby

undercutting the potential for racial integration. To examine the question of whether school
desegregation itself caused "white flight,"7 James Coleman and two colleagues (Coleman et
a!. 1975) examined enrollments in a sample of districts data over time, concluding that larger

white enrollment declines were associated with declines in measured segregation and with higher

proportions of black students. Although this conclusion met with initial opposition, the bulk of
subsequent empirical research has supported the main thrust of that study.
With a few exceptions, the empirical studies of the effect of desegregation on white

enrollment have utilized school-level data on enrollment by race, collected since 1967 by the
Office for Civil Rights (OCR), data which allow the calculation of indices of interracial contact

and segregation as well as changes in total enrollment. The unit of observation has generally
been the school district, with most studies focusing on urban districts. In general, the studies
have attempted to distinguish changes in white enrollment that are attributable to desegregation

policies from those that would have occurred in their absence. That is, since whites have been
4

declining as a percentage of all public school students in the country, and many central cities
have witnessed the decline in white population for years, it would be incorrect to attribute all of

those declines to desegregation policies. Two studies that sought to assess the Coleman et al.
results were Clotfelter (1979) and Farley, Richards, and Wurdock (1980), the former reanalyzing

the original data set and the latter using a sample of 104 urban school districts. Both studies
supported the basic Coleman et al. findings.
Subsequent studies likewise suggested that white enrollments are sensitive to the

presence of nonwhites in the public schools. Wilson (1985) contended that racial contact,
irrespective of the form of the policy, is the central cause of such losses. But a number of
subsequent studies concluded that the form of the policy was important, with white losses being

greater under mandatory desegregation plans than under voluntary plans. Welch and Light
(1987), Rossell (1990, 1994), and Rossell and Armor (1996) all compared the effects of different
desegregation techniques, and concluded that mandatory plans such as pairing or clustering lead
to bigger white losses. Some recent evidence offered by Armor (1995, p.1 79) further supports
the hypothesis that whites are sensitive to changes in racial composition in schools attended by

their children. Focusing on formerly minority schools to which whites were assigned as part of
mandatory desegregation plans, Armor shows abnormally high proportions of "no-shows" among

the whites. Similar sensitivity to racial composition is apparent in Lankford and Wyckoff's
(1997) study using the school choices of individual families in metropolitan areas in New York
State. All of this empirical work supports the working assumption stated by James (1989, p.
966): "white parents make decisions based on the actual or potential exposure of their children to
blacks, not how equally students are assigned to schools by race."

Recent Patterns and Trends
Before analyzing recent data on school racial patterns and white enrollment changes, it is

useful to consider broader patterns and trends in metropolitan areas. A basic fact is that public
schools at the metropolitan level tend to be quite segregated, in that the observed patterns of

enrollment by school depart markedly from racial balance. This divergence is greatest in the
largest metropolitan areas. By region, metropolitan-level segregation tends to be most severe in
the Northeast and Midwest, least in the West and South. The bulk of this observed segregation
can be attributed to disparities in racial composition among the various school districts in

metropolitan areas, as opposed to segregation within districts.8 Thus a considerable portion of
existing school segregation in metropolitan areas is associated with segregated housing patterns.

Combined with the Supreme Court's decision in the 1974 Milliken v. Bradley case, this
residential segregation virtually guarantees public school segregation in urban America for the
foreseeable future. Although Cutler, Glaeser and Vigdor (1999) find that neighborhood
segregation declined after 1970 and Parley and Frey (1994) report some lessening of residential
segregation in metropolitan areas during the 1980s (especially in younger, smaller areas), those

residential patterns remain highly segregated. Moreover, Massey and Hujnal (1995) argue that
segregation among jurisdictions has been increasing. Movements inside metropolitan areas
continue to be dominated by suburbanization by the middle class, both white and nonwhite,
leaving concentrations of poor people in parts of central cities.
Another set of trends with important implications are demographic. The racial and ethnic

composition of the school-age population is changing. Owing to immigration and differences in
birth rates, the black and Hispanic school-age population is growing faster than that of the white
6

population. As shown in Table 1, between 1986 and 1996, while the number of whites in public
elementary and secondary schools was increasing by 3 percent, the number of black students rose
by 14 percent, and the number of Hispanic students rose by 45 percent. According to Frey
(1995), the recent, ethnically diverse immigration that underlies some of these changes has
profoundly influenced patterns of internal migration, so that immigrants have come to supplant

natives in some metropolitan areas. Combining these demographic trends with ongoing
suburbanization, it should come as no surprise that public schools are becoming, on average,
increasingly nonwhite.9 Beyond that, however, the implications for school segregation and white
enrollments are by no means obvious.
Another set of changes, related to education policy rather than demography, arise from

consolidations of school districts. Although the findings in the present study suggest that any
movement in this regard is relatively minor, the temporal comparisons examined in this paper

require consistency in the definition of districts over time. Thus it will be necessary to pay
attention to consolidations and other changes in district boundaries.
A final trend with obvious relevance has to do with changes in attitude and race relations.
Although changes in this area are nothing if not complex, it appears that, over the last two
decades, interracial contact has slowly increased and white racial prejudice has declined

steadily.'°

II. Data and Methodology
The principal source of data used in the present paper is the National Center for
Education Statistics' Common Core of Data, which includes information on the racial
7

composition of individual schools." The research strategy for the current study was to collect
information for similarly-defined metropolitan areas at two points in time in order to assess

changes over that period. Data were not available for all metropolitan areas, however. The data
are supplied voluntarily by states, and, while the number of participating states has increased

steadily, a significant number did not participate during the 1980s. Weighing the advantages of a
longer period against the disadvantages of a smaller sample size, the decision was made to use
1987 as the beginning year. The Common Core for the fall of that year lacked data for 17 states,
compared to only two states that were missing in 1996.12

Calculations were made for metropolitan areas in both 1987 and 1996, using the
component counties (or, in New England, towns and cities) for each defined by the Census in
1990. Thus, while the definitions of metropolitan areas are periodically updated, the present
paper utilizes the definitions as of 1990 in order to achieve comparability over time. Given these
definitions and the states for which data were available, sufficient data were available for 238

metropolitan areas to make comparable calculations for both 1987 and 1996. In 1996 these 238
areas contained almost 4,000 districts. As in the case of the metropolitan areas, it was desirable

to have consistent definitions of the school districts over the period. However, this aim was
frustrated by changes in district boundaries over time, most commonly consolidations of two or

more 1987 districts into one 1996 district. Through careful accounting, comparable districts
were formed, typically by combining the components of the consolidated district into a "virtual"

district in 1987. These virtual districts constituted only about 2 percent of the districts in the
sample.13

Measures and Variables

The basic measure of white behavior is changes in white public school enrollment. This
measure is necessarily a net measure, reflecting the difference between departures and new

enrollments. As such, the measure cannot measure the absolute number of departures, nor can it
identify whether departures take the form of moving to another district, enrolling in a private

school, or simply graduation. Nor can it reflect the choice not to move into a district in the first
place, a decision having much the same impact as a departure. Where W0 and W are white
enrollments in years 0 and t, the change in white enrollment is expressed as the exponential
growth rate g in the equation

W0 e.
Expressed as a percentage, the growth rate between 1987 and 1996 is
100 g = 100 in (W96/W87)/9.

Measures of composition and segregation are based entirely on racial and ethnic

categories used in the survey. No measure of economic status is included.'4 The basic measure
of interracial contact is the exposure rate of whites to nonwhites, which is the percent nonwhite

in the average white student's school. It is defined as:
E= (11W)

W [N. /(W + N)]

,

(1)

where W and N1 are the number of whites and nonwhites, respectively, in school i and W and N

are their totals for the district. If schools were racially balanced, each white child would attend a
school whose racial composition was PCN = N/(W+N), the overall proportion of students who
are nonwhite. The gap between this theoretical maximum and the actual rate of racial contact,
9

expressed as a proportion of the area's racial composition, represents one measure of the extent of
segregation.15 This gap-based index,
S = (PCN - E)/PCN,

ranges from zero, signifying perfect racial balance among schools, to one, signifying total

segregation. Since the measures of exposure and segregation are based on school-level
enrollment data, they do not measure racial contact in classrooms or in school groups. Nor do
these measures differentiate between voluntary or mandatory desegregation plans.
To account for differences in overall growth among metropolitan areas, the population
growth rate, expressed as a percentage, is included as an explanatory variable:
PG = 100 in (P901P80)/l0.

Finally, to account for the differing legal history of school segregation and other, otherwise
unmeasured regional differences, metropolitan areas were assigned to one of five regions: South,
Border, Northeast, Midwest, and West.16

Patterns and Trends in the Data
Before discussing the last set of variables, it is useful to examine the sample of 238

metropolitan areas for patterns and trends. It is helpful to begin by examining aggregate figures.
Table 1 compares total public school enrollment for the nation with the enrollment in the 238

metropolitan areas analyzed in the current study. Not only does it give a sense of overall
demographic changes over time, the table also allows an assessment of how representative the

data used in the present analysis are. As indicated by the total enrollment figures, the present
sample -- although it omits all schools outside of metropolitan areas as well as metropolitan areas
10

for which complete data were not available -- still covers more than half of all public school

students. As expected, the racial composition of these metropolitan areas differs from the nation
at large, featuring higher percentages of blacks, Hispanics, and other nonwhites than the U.S. as a

whole. It is clear also that the racial composition of the nation and metropolitan areas is
changing over time, with nonwhites assuming a continually increasing share. The reason behind
this changing composition is illustrated in the table's last column, which lists average annual
growth rates for each racial and ethnic group. Enrollment of whites grew at 0.5 percent a year,
slower than the rate for blacks (2.0 percent) , and considerably slower than the 5.4 percent rate
for Hispanics and the 4.4 percent for other nonwhite students.

To illustrate the sort of data examined, Table 2 presents several measures for 16
metropolitan areas of various sizes and from different regions. The table makes plain the great
differences in size of metropolitan areas: public school enrollment in these 16 areas in 1987
ranged from 1.3 million in the 83 districts in the Los Angeles-Long Beach PMSA to 32,000 in

the two districts covered by the Tallahassee MSA. In keeping with the findings of Clotfelter
(forthcoming), larger metropolitan areas, and those in the Northeast and Midwest, tended to have

more districts than smaller areas and those in the South and West. The areas also differed
markedly in racial and ethnic composition. The percentage of students who were nonwhite
(which includes Hispanic whites) ranged from 3 percent in Johnstown to 71 percent in Los

Angeles-Long Beach, with other nonwhites outnumbering blacks in the latter. Blacks were
relatively most numerous in the Southern areas, Columns F and U of the table give the average
annual growth rate in white and nonwhite enrollment for metropolitan areas. Reflecting the
national trends shown in Table 1, nonwhite enrollments were increasing in all these metropolitan
11

areas, while whites increased in only about two thirds of them.

Racial segregation at the metropolitan level differed quite a bit among the 16 areas
shown, but the calculated indices for individual metropolitan areas did not change greatly over

the period. Clotfelter (forthcoming) shows that segregation in the public schools is most
pronounced in the largest metropolitan areas, and the calculations for the areas shown in this
table bear out that generalization; Detroit, in fact, was found to have the most segregated schools

among all metropolitan areas studied in 1994. However, some of the areas, in particular the
seven with indices less than 0.20, exhibited quite low levels of segregation, suggesting near
racial balance throughout the public schools in each metropolitan area.

Because much of the interest in white withdrawals from public schools has focused on
individual school districts, especially central city districts, it is useful to examine data for some

illustrative districts as well. Table 3 presents information for the two largest districts in each of
the 16 metropolitan areas shown in Table 2. For a majority of the metropolitan areas, the largest
district also shares the name of the area's primary central city. In 1987 these districts ranged in
size from 582,871 in Los Angeles to 3,104 in Somerset, PA. As a percentage of their respective
metropolitan areas, they ranged from 74.1 percent in Hillsborough County, Florida to 2.9 percent

in Lynn, Massachusetts. In most cases, the largest district in each metropolitan area had both a
higher nonwhite percentage and a slower growth rate of white students than the metropolitan area

as a whole. (Exceptions were in Raleigh-Durham and Tallahassee.) Their growth in nonwhite
enrollments was less predictable, however, with 19 of the 32 districts having faster nonwhite

growth than their metropolitan areas. Revealing their generally low levels of segregation,
exposure rates were quite close to their overall nonwhite proportions.
12

The last three columns relate to the opportunities open to white families to reduce their
children's exposure to nonwhites in the public schools by moving to other districts in the

metropolitan area. As one simple measure of such opportunities, column H shows, for each
district, the number of districts in its metropolitan area that satisfied these conditions in 1987:
enrollment 5,000 or more, no more than 10 miles away, and an exposure rate to nonwhites at

least 10 percentage points less than the listed district. Using this criterion, one discovers that
whiter! alternative districts did exist for almost half of these districts, with as many as 21 such
districts, in the case of Boston. The last two columns present more refined measures of access
that are discussed in the following section.
To get a more representative picture of racial composition and white enrollment growth
in districts, Table 4 presents weighted mean values by size and region of metropolitan area. The
table shows clearly that the nonwhite percentage tended to rise with metropolitan area size: while
the smallest metropolitan areas had enrollments that averaged 25 percent nonwhite, those in the

largest metropolitan areas averaged 54 percent. By region, the components of the nonwhite
percentage differed markedly, with blacks being most numerous in Midwest districts and

Hispanics and other nonwhites most numerous in the West. Overall, white enrollments were
declining over the nine-year period. They declined most rapidly in districts contained in the
largest metropolitan areas, and they grew slightly in districts within the smallest metropolitan

areas.

The Spatial Context of Enrollment Choices
An important aspect of enrollment shifts in metropolitan areas lies in their spacial
1-,

L)

context. White families which, for whatever reason, desire to enroll their children in public
schools with a smaller proportion of nonwhites usually can bring this about by moving to another

district. If they are moving into a metropolitan area, they can simply avoid districts with high
nonwhite enrollments. But locating in predominantly white districts may entail longer commutes
to work. Thus the desirability of moving from or avoiding a given urban district will likely
depend on the existence of alternative public school districts with lower nonwhite percentages,
the extent of the difference in racial compositions, and the distance from that given district to the
alternative districts.
To illustrate the variegated jurisdictional landscape in metropolitan areas, Table 5
presents data for the largest districts in three metropolitan areas. The largest of these three,

Detroit, features a dominant central city district surrounded by a multitude of other districts,

many of which would accurately be described as "suburban." True to the stereotype of big U.S.
urban areas, the Detroit district is overwhelmingly nonwhite in composition, while most of the

surrounding districts are predominantly white. Within the Detroit district, the racial makeup of
individual schools deviated from racial balance, as indicated by the segregation index of 26.6.
During the nine-year sample period, the number of whites in the Detroit district fell by a rate of

more than 5 percent a year. White families in Detroit who wanted to move from or avoid moving
into the Detroit district could certainly find alternative districts with lower exposure rates to
nonwhites, but locating in one of the biggest of these would require being more than 10 miles
away from the center of the Detroit district. Many virtually all-white enclaves did exist, however,
among the more than 100 smaller districts not listed in the table.
In contrast to the dominating size of one central city district, the Anaheim metropolitan
14

area features much more balance among the top eight districts. The racial composition also
differs markedly, with Hispanics and other nonwhites being much more numerous than blacks.
Distances to the largest district, Santa Ana, tended to be less, but so too were the differences in

potential exposure rates for whites. As in the Detroit area, the largest district was characterized
by an exposure rate over 80 percent and a declining white enrollment. A third pattern is
illustrated by the smaller Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area, which contains only five districts.
The largest of these, the county containing Raleigh, features growing rather than declining white
enrollment. It is the second-largest district, Durham, that is characterized by the high exposure
rate and white decline usually associated with central city districts.

As these three examples amply illustrate, districts can differ greatly in how easy it is for
white families to lower their exposure to nonwhites by avoiding or moving from some districts.
As illustrated by the largest two districts in each of the 16 illustrative metropolitan areas shown
above, comparatively white alternatives are not uncommon, but in some metropolitan areas they

simply do not exist. As an illustration of how common such alternatives were in 1987, a
tabulation showed that over a third of white students in the 975 largest districts in the current
sample could have lowered their exposure rate by at least 0.10 by moving to a district within 10
miles.17 If one wishes to model white enrollment shifts, it is important to take such alternatives

into account. While a few studies of school segregation and white flight have included variables
that are designed to reflect the opportunities for avoidance on a very aggregated level within

metro areas, none to my knowledge has incorporated data on distance among districts in a
metropolitan area. In the present paper I propose two measures to characterize the options facing
white families in metropolitan areas. Each of these measures is designed to account for three
15

spatially-related factors that would impinge on any white family's decision to move to another
district, to avoid moving into a district in the first place, or to enroll in a private school:

a)How many other options for enrollment are available in the local housing market? One
way of measuring this is by enrollment: how large are the whiter alternative districts compared to
the enrollment of the family's own school system?

b)How close in distance are those other districts? If one must move a long way away to
attend a different district, that might mean changing jobs or commuting farther, given that the
current location is otherwise logical, if not optimal. The farther away, the less good the option.
c)How much can the exposure to nonwhites be reduced (the postulated objective for

changing schools) by moving? If other districts offer similar rates of exposure, there would be
little gain from moving no matter how far away they are.
Two variables of accessibility to whiter districts, which take these three factors into

account, are defined below. District i is the "origin" district, from whose perspective the
calculations are made; districts j are possible alternative districts. D1 is the distance between
districts i and j. E1 is the average exposure rate of whites to nonwhites in district i and T is the
enrollment in district i.

and T are defined similarly. The bigger, the more numerous, and the

closer the alternative districts featuring lower exposure rates to nonwhites, the greater are the

options for reducing nonwhite exposure through relocation. The first measure selects as possible
alternatives those districts that are within 10 miles distance and feature an exposure rate at least
10 percentage points (0.10) less than the origin district. In order to account for the relative size
of these possible destination districts, this measure of accessibility is based on the ratio of the

enrollment of such districts to that of the origin district:
16

Al = [

(T/T) ] for allj s.t. E-E

0.10 and D1 10 miles,

where r is a factor reflecting the importance of alternative enrollments. If r 1, the accessibility
proxy rises in proportion to the enrollment of neighboring districts offering the 10 percentagepoint potential reduction in exposure; if r = 0.5, it rises with the square root. The threshold values
of 10 miles for distance and 10 percent for exposure are quite arbitrary, of course. In order to
account for distance and exposure on a continuous basis, a second measure adds these two

factors multiplicatively:

A2 =

(T/T) (1/ D)a (E.E)JS for (E-E)>0,

where a is a constant indicating the effect of distance on the attractiveness of a particular
alternative district and s is another constant.

Both Al and A2 are proxy variables having no exact interpretation. Their values are
arbitrary, depending on the parameters a, r, and s. All that can be said about these proxy
variables is that a given district will have large values for them the more a district is surrounded
by close, relatively large, and predominantly white districts. In the analysis described below, the
values of a and s are both assigned 0.5, while r

1. In order to approximate distances between

pairs of districts, I measure the distance between the centroids of the zip codes in which the
district offices are located.19

To give a sense of the values for Al and A2, Table 3 presents calculations of these

indices for the two largest districts in each of the 16 metropolitan areas listed in Table 2. Both
indices suggest considerable divergence in accessibility to whiter enclaves among this group of
32 districts. The indices are highly correlated: the districts in which white families have the best

17

opportunities to lessen their exposure to nonwhites tend to have higher values of both indices,
although the differences are less stark with A2, owing to the continuity built into it.2° Districts
where whites are deemed to have more opportunities for avoidance are Lynn, MA, Aldine, TX,
Boston, and Providence, all of which feature high exposure rates and proximity to districts with

much lower ones. At the other end of the opportunity spectrum are large districts with relatively
low exposure rates: Leon County, FL, Wake County, NC, and Warwick, RI. Despite the arbitrary
nature of these two accessibility measures, it seems clear that they both reflect the same basic

phenomenon. Not surprisingly, these two accessibility measures yield similar results in

tabulations and estimation. In the estimates presented below, Al is used because it is the
simpler of the two measures, but the qualitative results are not affected by which measure is
used.

III. Analysis of White Enrollment Changes by District
A perusal of Table 3 suggests that the districts having the fastest white enrollment
declines tended to be those with high proportions of nonwhites and more opportunities for
avoidance of nonwhites. To see whether this relationship exists more generally, Table 6 shows
the average growth rate of whites in 374 larger districts (all with school enrollments of 5,000 or
more and at least 10 percent of its metropolitan area's enrollment), broken down by accessibility

(Al) and whites' exposure rate to nonwhties. In line with the tendencies noted in the previous
table, the growth rate of white enrollment tends to decline as both variables increase, suggesting
that white enrollment trends over this period were influenced both by the "push" of interracial
contact and the "pull" of nearby whiter school districts.
18

In order to examine more fully the forces that influence changes in white enrollment, I
estimated equations explaining the growth rate in white enrollment between 1987 and 1996.
Previous analysis of "white flight" from urban school districts focused almost entirely on large,
central city districts, most of which were in large metropolitan areas. Indeed, Coleman (1975, p.
11) stated: "The flight from integration appears to be principally a large-city phenomenon."
Because of the continuing significance of their enrollment patterns, these big urban districts
should obviously remain a major focus of research. However, it seems possible if not likely that

urban districts differ in the enrollment patterns they exhibit. For example, small metropolitan
areas, owing to the comparative ease of traversing them, may evince different residential and

enrollment patterns than large metropolitan areas. Another possibility worth examining is that
enrollment patterns for districts which are small relative to their metropolitan areas might be

easier to avoid or be otherwise different from dominant districts. Given the large number of
metropolitan areas and districts encompassed by the current sample, it is possible to analyze
separately districts according to metropolitan area size. It is also possible to distinguish between
districts that account for a significant share of their metropolitan area's total enrollment (defined
here as a 10 percent share) and those that are small in relation to the whole.

The 3,933 districts in the sample were divided into four samples. The first three samples
were restricted to districts at least 5,000. Not only are these the most important districts to study,
measured enrollment growth for them is less subject to error or undetected changes in district

definitions. The first sample includes those sorts of districts which have traditionally received
the bulk of attention in studies of white enrollment losses; these are districts in metropolitan
areas with public school enrollments of 50,000 or more which account for at least 10 percent of
19

the total enrollment of their respective metropolitan area. The second sample includes districts in
metropolitan areas with enrollments smaller than 50,000, again with at least 10 percent of the

metropolitan total. The third sample includes districts with less than 10 percent of their
metropolitan enrollment; given the 5,000 minimum size, these districts were thus all in

metropolitan areas of 50,000 or more. The remaining fourth sample, composed of districts
smaller than 5,000, is by far the most numerous, containing over three quarters of all the districts

studied.
Previous econometric studies of white enrollment losses have sought to explain white
losses, usually measured by percentage change, as a function of variables describing racial
composition, segregation, and other factors thought to be important in the decisions of white
families. One early and influential study, by Coleman et a!. (1975), noted above, used panel data
on a set of large urban districts to estimate the equation:

%Wa+b1 Sb+b2Pb+ b3lnT+ XZ+u,
where %W is the percentage change in white enrollment, Sb is the change in the segregation

index (using blacks in place of nonwhites), b is the proportion of blacks in the district, T is
district enrollment, Z is a vector of other variables, a, the b's, and the vector X are coefficients,

and u is an error term. As noted above, Coleman et al. found that greater white losses were
associated with higher black proportions and decreases in segregation, leading to their conclusion
that school desegregation was causing white flight, and was therefore contributing to the
resegregation of schoo1s.2

20

The present study employs a similar model, but with a wider variety of school districts
and with a single cross-section of one-year changes in place of the pooled annual changes

analyzed by Coleman et al. Change in white enrollment is measured by the exponential annual
growth rate.22 In place of the district percentage black, I used the exposure rate of whites to

nonwhites, because exposure, not overall district racial composition, affects the experiences of
whites, and to reflect the large and growing significance of Latinos and Asian-Americans in

urban school systems. Accessibility to whiter alternative districts is measured by Al, as
described above. The growth rate of metropolitan area population from 1980 to 1990 is included
to account for overall metropolitan growth. It seems reasonable to treat this growth as an
exogenous variable. Finally, a set of dummy variables is included to reflect regional differences
in the growth of white enrollments.
Table 7 presents for each of the samples of districts the mean values for the basic

variables used in estimation. Among the four samples, the growth rate of white enrollment, as
well as interracial exposure and accessibility, differs noticeably. The two samples of districts in
the largest metropolitan areas, I and III, show declines in white enrollments on average, whereas
white enrollments in the average district in sample II remained steady over the period and those
in the smallest districts grew. The sample I districts had much higher rates of exposure of whites
to nonwhites than those in II and III, fitting the common image of large central city districts,
while the smallest districts displayed the lowest exposure rates. Accessibility to districts with
lower exposure rates also differed, with the smaller districts in III and IV having the highest

indices. It is also worth noting that samples III and IV have relatively fewer districts in the
South, owing to the large average size of districts in that region.
21

Table 8 presents the basic model explaining growth in white enrollments estimated for

each of the four samples of school districts. Since the measured index of segregation depends in
large part on the district's desegregation policy, and that policy could be influenced by white
enrollment trends, it is not altogether clear that the change in segregation should be treated as

exogenous as Coleman et al. did. Accordingly, the basic model is estimated using instrumental
variables as an alternative to ordinary least squares.

The similarity of the estimates across the four samples is quite striking. Three variables
are consistently important in explaining white growth rates in this basic model, regardless of the
sample or estimation technique employed. First, the exposure of whites to nonwhites in 1987 has

large and statistically significant estimated coefficients. Equation (1), for example, implies that
in the most important districts in the large metropolitan areas an increase in exposure of 0.10 —
say from 0.15 to 0.25 — in 1987 would have been associated with an acceleration of white losses,

in the form of a decrease in the growth rate of white enrollment of -0.7 percent a year. The
estimated effect is somewhat smaller in sample II, but it is considerably larger in samples III and
IV, implying a responsiveness half again as large in the smaller and less "significant" districts.
The strong effect of exposure in all four samples is very much in line with Coleman et al.'s

results for the district's proportion of blacks and with James' (1989) stated assumption that
whites respond to interracial contact, not segregation per Se.

A second consistent finding, indicated by the negative estimated coefficients for Al, is
that white losses were greater where there were more opportunities in the metropolitan area for
whites to find districts with lower rates of exposure — the "pull" factor. This finding is, of

course, quite complementary to the first.23 The third consistent finding is that white enrollment

trends were — not surprisingly — influenced by overall metropolitan growth. Where the

metropolitan population was growing, white enrollments in large districts tended to grow rather
than shrink, but where the metropolis was stagnant there was less impetus to maintain white

enrollments. This correspondence is much higher in the smaller metropolitan areas of sample II
and the small districts in sample IV.
The major policy variable in the equations is the change in the segregation index.
Holding constant interracial exposure in 1987, an increase in segregation would be expected to
hold whites and thus increase the white enrollment growth rate (or decrease the rate of loss).
This is what Coleman et al. (1975) found in their study of larger urban districts. And it is also
what is implied in equation (1) in Table 8, the OLS equation covering the sample most similar to

the ones they analyzed. The estimated coefficient in that equation implies that an increase in the
segregation index S of 0.10 would have decreased the rate of white enrollment decline by 0.83,

say from its mean of -1.55 to -0.72 percent a year. The corresponding coefficients in the other
equations are not statistically significant, however. The estimated effect of this variable loses its
statistical significance when it is treated as endogenous in the instrumental variables estimation
in equation (5), as it also does in equations (6) and (7). Equation (8) actually yields a significant
negative coefficient, but comparison to the OLS version suggests that that coefficient is quite
unstable. Unfortunately, the first stage equations in all these equations are poor predictors of the
change in segregation, resulting in estimated coefficients that are generally small relative to their
standard errors, though with little change in the other coefficients of interest.

For the most part, the equations reveal little regional variation in white enrollment growth
apart from that which is explained by the other included regressors. Only in samples III and IV is

Li

there a statistically significant regional effect: in those relatively small districts, whites were less
likely to leave or avoid districts in the South.

Central to these estimates is the reaction of white parents to the presence of nonwhites in
the schools their children attend. It is especially germane to ask at least two questions related to

that reaction. First, are whites more sensitive to one group of nonwhites than to others? To
examine this question the first four equations in Table 9 split up the exposure rate of whites to

nonwhites into three components, corresponding to blacks, Hispanics, and other nonwhites. For
all but sample II, an F-test rejects at the 99 percent level the hypothesis that all the coefficients
are the same. In each of those cases, the estimates suggest that whites respond most sharply to
exposure to blacks24

The other exposure-related question addressed in Table 9 is whether the reaction of
whites to nonwhite exposure in the schools is nonlinear, specifically whether there is a "tipping
point," or a threshold exposure rate beyond which white departures and avoidance accelerate. To
allow for such nonlinearities, both cubic and spline functions were estimated, with much the

same result. Plots of the former are shown in the table and illustrated in Figure 1, which gives
the predicted rate of growth of whites, calculated at mean values, as a ftinction of exposure to

nonwhites in 1987. They are remarkably similar, implying growth in white enrollments where
exposure rates are below about 0.25 and losses beyond that point. Over most of the range of
exposure rates the rate of loss is approximately linear. There is no evidence of a threshold
beyond which losses accelerate. In fact, losses are reversed somewhat at very high exposure rates
in samples I and III.

The conclusion that arises from these regressions is that the phenomenon of "white
24

flight," the loss of whites from school districts featuring significant interracial exposure, first

identified and studied in the 1970s, was still at work in the 1990s. To be sure, white enrollment
losses are made more likely by a slowing growth rate among the white population nationally and
in metropolitan areas that are not growing, but they continue to be stimulated by exposure to

nonwhites in the public schools, especially where those rates become large. Such white losses
are moderated by configurations of school districts that minimize the opportunities for avoidance,

such as the large county-wide districts common in parts of the South and West. But in the
absence of a dramatic reversal of the Supreme Court's ban on cross-district desegregation plans,
as well as the continuing influx of nonwhite immigrants, we are likely to see a continuation of
these trends.
Before turning to the implications of these findings for school segregation, it is instructive

to compare them to the earlier study by Coleman et al. (1975). Like Coleman et al., I find that
districts with higher rates of white enrollment losses also had higher exposure rates to nonwhites.
Changes in segregation are less clearly implicated, although the OLS estimates for sample I are

consistent with Coleman et al.'s earlier findings. In order to compare present patterns of white
withdrawal with those observed by Coleman et al. two decades earlier, a similar specification
was estimated for sample I, the sample most similar to the group of large districts analyzed in the
earlier study. The racial composition and segregation variables were redefined using blacks
instead of nonwhites, to conform to Coleman et a!. Table 10 compares the Coleman et al.

regressions with this reestimated one using sample I. For both change in segregation and
exposure, the responses implied using the recent data in sample I are considerably smaller than

those implied by the sample of largest districts in 1968-73. They are, however, much closer in
25

magnitude to those based on the sample of 46 smaller central city districts. In another
specification, not shown here, the estimated effect of between-district segregation based on the
current sample I is quite similar to that reported by Coleman et al.25 Like the regressions

presented above, this comparison suggests that the factors contributing to white losses from
urban public school districts have not changed substantially in the 20 years since this topic first

arose as a serious policy concern. While the magnitude of white response is not as large as that
which Coleman et al. found for the very largest central city districts, it remains substantial.

IV. Implications for Segregation in Schools
The estimates presented above make clear that white losses from urban public schools are
not evenly distributed, but rather are systematically related to interracial contact and the ease of
avoiding that contact. This kind of systematic avoidance was documented in research done in the
1 970s. The present paper shows that it remained an important phenomenon in the 1 990s. Since a

principal concern about white enrollment losses has been that they would lead to resegregation, it
is useful to conclude by considering the impact of these white enrollment trends on measured
segregation.

Overall, public schools in metropolitan areas became more segregated between 1987 and

1996. Figure 2 shows the distribution of metropolitan areas by segregation index S. It reveals a
perceptible shift to the right, with a decline in the number of metro areas in the lowest two
categories and increases in most of the higher categories.

Table 11 presents a more detailed summary of changes in metropolitan-level school
segregation. The entries give the weighted average of the segregation index S for the 238
26

metropolitan areas in the present sample, broken down by size and region. In addition, the
segregation indices are decomposed into two components: the portion that is attributable to
segregation between districts and that which is attributable to segregation within districts.26 The

table's top row shows that, for the entire sample of 238 metropolitan areas, school segregation
increased over the nine-year period; the average value of S increased from 0.3 02 to 0.317. As
there was actually a decline in within-district segregation, this overall increase was entirely
attributable to an increase in between-district segregation. In other words, the racial
compositions of school districts tended to diverge over this period, a change that would have
been aided by systematic white losses from racially mixed school districts. Table 11 makes plain
the tendency noted in Clotfelter (forthcoming) for segregation to rise with the size of the

metropolitan area; this relationship is clear for both 1987 and 1996. The last set of columns
shows, however, that segregation grew in all but the largest metropolitan areas over this period.
When the data are classified by region, the effect of the balkanized metropolitan areas of the
Northeast and Midwest are evident: not only do those regions feature the highest rates of
segregation, they also have the biggest increases in segregation — again attributable to growing

disparities between districts. The South had the highest level of within-district segregation in
both years. Overall, the picture that arises is one of entrenched segregation, caused mainly by
racial disparities between districts rather than segregation within school districts, and steady

increases in that segregation. This picture is very much in line with Coleman et al.'s (1975, p.
80) statement: "The emerging problem of school segregation in large cities is a problem of
metropolitan area residential segregation, black central cities and white suburbs, brought about

by a loss of whites from the central cities." Barring any change in the legal status of
27

metropolitan desegregation, the only prospect for a reduction in school segregation is a lessening
of residential segregation, a possibility raised by the recent work of Farley and Frey (1994).

V. Conclusion
This paper uses recent data to examine an old question: what factors are associated with

white losses from urban public schools? Using data covering all public schools in 238
metropolitan areas in 1987 and 1996, the present analysis suggests that much the same set of
forces were at work in the 1990s as in the 1970s. The rate of white loss is affected by the "push"
or exposure to nonwhites as well as the attraction of more predominantly white districts

elsewhere in the same metropolitan area. Since segregation within districts by 1996 was rather
mild in most districts, the key element in predicting whether whites would rapidly abandon

central city districts is the size and homogeneity of all the districts in a metropolitan area. In
particular, where the dominant districts are large, the prospects for avoiding large white losses
are good. Furthermore, these forces appear to work similarly both inside arid outside the South.

To be sure, the world of urban public schools did change over the two decades. The proportion
of nonwhites grew, in significant part due to immigration. In addition, the relative affluence of
those at the upper end of the income distribution rose at the same time that Catholic parochial
schools were in decline, probably increasing the socioeconomic gap between public and private
schools.

Not surprisingly, the current paper leaves some important questions unanswered. For
example, the models used do not distinguish between residential location and private school

enrollment as alternative avenues for white avoidance of racial exposure. The relative cost of
28

these options surely affects their use; this relative cost is only crudely proxied by the measures

used here to reflect accessibility to white enclaves. Nor does the paper examine the effects of
contact across socioeconomic groups, as opposed to the racial and ethnic groupings used here

and elsewhere. In addition, the data used in the paper contain no information on racial contact
within schools, which is affected by the extent of academic tracking. Nor do the measures used
here distinguish between mandatory desegregation plans and the various alternative policies that

have been used to desegregate schools. Such factors as these are likely to be important
considerations for parents — both white and nonwhite — deciding where to send their children to

school. Given the implications of these decisions for the racial composition and segregation of
the public schools, research on this topic remains as important today as it was two decades ago.

was based on several different criteria, including whether districts were under courtorder, the
coverage of minority enrollments, and the ability to project sample findings to national totals.

Increases over the same period in cities outside the South were: 7 to 14 percent in Dayton, 6 to

10. These trends are illustrated by annual surveys of high school seniors done as part of the
Monitoring the Future project. The percentage of white seniors who reported that they "do
things (conversation, eating together, playing sports) with people of other races" increased from
an average of 50 percent in 1976-78 to 65 percent in 1993-95. (The percentage for blacks stayed
about the same.) The percentage of white seniors who felt it would be desirable for their

"(future) children go to schools where some of the children are of other races" increased over the
period from an average of 28 percent to 31 percent. Interestingly, the comparable average
percentage for blacks declined, from 37 to 31 percent over the period. (Tuch, Sigelman, and

11. Specifically, the data were taken from Public Education Agency Universe and Public School
Universe of the Common Core of Data (http:/nces.ed.gov/ccdl and
http ./nces. ed. gov/surveys/SDDB/introd.html). Enrollment by racial group (American Indian,
Asian or Pacific Islander, Hispanic, Black, non-Hispanic, White, non-Hispanic) was available for
all schools for the academic year 1996-97. Virtually all districts reported consistent and clean
data. A few did not; the sums for schools did not match the totals reported for districts. For
those whose school-level data gave different sums, I based all calculations on the school-level
data. Some districts reported no school-level data whatsoever; these had to be dropped.
A handful of(33) state-wide schools (such as the N.C. School of Science and Math) are listed
as districts. Since they should not be considered to be part of the metropolitan areas where they
are located, they were dropped from the sample.
12. Because one of the missing states in 1996, New Jersey, was not missing for 1987, there were
a total of 18 omitted states for the matched sample.
13. Data from the Common Core data sets for 1987-88 and 1996-97 were matched by district,
and organized by county and metropolitan area. In an effort to see if there were errors in the
data, printouts of schools by district were examined in detail. Growth in total enrollments by
county were compared to growth in population. Where they deviated significantly or where
district enrollments or numbers of schools differed greatly or where districts disappeared or
appeared from the first to the second year, school names were used in matching to determine how
the districts compared. In a few cases, schools in two districts were reorganized into two new
districts, creating for the present sample two virtual districts, defined according to the schools
each contained in 1996. Of the 875 districts with enrollments of 5,000 or more, there were 18
virtual districts created due to consolidation. Those that underwent consolidation were, on
average, smaller and had lower nonwhite percentages, but there was no significantdifference in
the change in their segregation indices.
14. Counts of students receiving free and reduced price lunches are available in the data set, but
this information was not used because of variations across states in eligibility criteria and the
likelihood that existing criteria are unevenly applied.

15. This measure, denoted R, is used by Coleman et al. (1975). For a discussion of this measure
and its relationship to measures of exposure, see Clotfelter (1978).
It is useful to note that the value of S is invariant with respect to which of two groups is
used as the basis for calculating the exposure rate. That is, S can be calculated using the
exposure of nonwhites to whites, where W, the overall percentage of students who are white, is
the maximum for this exposure rate: S = (W - ENW) I W.
16. Following Orfield and Monfort (1992, p. 2), I defined regions as follows: South: Alabama,
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee,

Texas, Virginia; Border: Delaware, District of Columbia, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri,
Oklahoma, West Virginia; Northeast: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont; Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Ohio, Wisconsin; West:
Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah,
Washington, Wyoming. In the 13 cases where a metropolitan area (MSA or PMSA) had
components from two regions, I classified it in the region containing the largest enrollment.

Cos D = (Sin Li) (Sin L2) + (Cos Li) (Cos L2) (Cos DL)
(Fitzpatrick and Modlin 1986, p.XI). The distance in miles is 69.16 D.
The use of centroids for ZIP codes of the district offices generally yields locations that
are quite central to the population center of each district, but not always. An example where this
approach does not work as well is Chapel Hill, N.C., for which the centroid of the district
office's ZIP code (27516) lies altogether outside the district boundaries.
20. The correlation between Al and A2 in the three samples discussed below are 0.86, 0.85, and
0.86.
21. The estimates of Coleman et al. (1975) are discussed below.

22. For comparison, Appendix Table A4 presents equations employing a slight modification of
the Coleman et al. specification, wherein the percentage change in whites is replaced by its
growth rate. Like the estimates obtained in the 1975 study, both change in segregation and
district black proportion show up as statistically significant in all three equations. White losses
are spurred by the black proportion and declines in measured segregation.
23. Regressions using A2 rather than Al produce quite similar estimates.
24. The calculated test statistics based on the sum of squared residuals were 5.2, 0.3, 6.3, and
45.1 in the four equations. The corresponding critical value for two restrictions at the 99 percent
level of confidence ranges from 4.60 to 4.75.
25. The variable RSMSA, which is the between-district segregation index for the metropolitan
area based on blacks and whites, operates like Al to indicate the availability of predominantly

white districts with the metropolitan area. Whereas the coefficient on this variable reported by
Coleman et al is -21.0 and -10.2 in their two samples, it was -12.6 in the comparable equation
estimated for sample I.
26. As shown in Clotfelter (forthcoming), the segregation measure S can be decomposed in the
following way. Consider the hypothetical exposure rate for the metropolitan area that would
occur if each district were to racially balance its schools. Just as any district's racial composition
(measured by the percent nonwhite, N) represents the maximum attainable exposure rate of
whites to nonwhites, the maximum exposure rate for the metropolitan area that could be achieved
within the constraints imposed by the existing racial compositions of school districts this
hypothetical rate. Where this hypothetical exposure rate is E*, the gap that is due to inter-district
disparities between districts is S1 (N - E*)IN. The gap due to segregation within districts is
S2 = S - S = (E* - E)/N, that is, the difference between the exposure rate if all districts were
racially balanced and the actual exposure rate, as a proportion of the overall nonwhite proportion.

Note: The sample consists of districts in the 238 metropolitan areas which had
enrollments in 1987 of 5,000 and which had a least 10 percent of the
metropolitan area's growth rate of white enrollment, weighted by district enrollment.
The top number in each cell is the weighted average annual growth rate of white
enrollment, weighted by district enrollment. The number of districts in each cell
is below the mean in italics.

(a) For each district, Al is positive only if there existed other districts in its
metropolitan area not more than 10 miles away with a white-nonwhite exposusre rate
at least 0.10 less than the district in question. Al is the square root of the ratio of the
enrollments of all such districts to the enrollment of the district in question. See text.
(b) No districts.
