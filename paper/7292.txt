Affiliates of U.S. and Japanese Multinationals
in East Asian Production and Trade

NBER Working Paper No. 7292

JEL No. F19, F23
ABSTRACT
Since 1977, and in some cases starting before that, most East Asian countries’ export patterns in
manufacturing have been transformed from industry distributions typical of developing countries to
distributions more like those of advanced countries. The process of change in most cases started with
inward FDI to produce for export in the new industries, particularly by U.S. firms in electronics and
computer-related machinery. The U.S. firms were followed, in electronics, by Japanese multinationals.
Over time, in most cases, the U.S.-owned affiliates turned more to sales in host-country markets and their
share in host country exports declined, although the host countries’ specializations in the new industries
continued.
U.S. and Japanese firms played somewhat different roles. U.S. firms’ investments were always
distributed more along the lines of U.S. export comparative advantage, far from the previous patterns of
the host countries. The industry distribution of Japanese investments initially followed more the lines of the
host countries’ comparative advantage and Japanese affiliates were less export-oriented than U.S. affiliates.
However, Japanese affiliates have become more like U.S. affiliates in both export orientation and industry
composition.

Their early concentration in textiles and apparel faded and they are more heavily

concentrated than U.S. affiliates and more export-oriented in both electrical machinery and transport
equipment.

Affiliates of U.S. and Japanese Multinationals in East Asian Production and Trade
Robert E. Lipsey*
Introduction
FDI is one of the Main avenues for the movement of technology and modern business methods
across national borders. FDI from the more developed countries is presumably more likely to carry
advanced technology than that from developing countries. Developing countries, those in Asia have
been among the more receptive to inward direct investment than those in other regions. Of all the direct
investment by developed countries in the developing countries of Asia, the United States and Japan
account for by far the largest shares, together over 80 per cent of the outward FDI stock from
developed countries at the end of 1996 (OECD, 1998). This combination of reasons is the motivation
for the focus in this paper on the roles of U.S. and Japanese multinationals (MNCs), in particular the
affiliates of these MNCs, in the growth and composition of production and trade in the countries of East
Asia.
There are two basic types of data with which one can study the role of multinational firms in the
host countries where they operate. One type is home country data on the foreign activities of the
multinational firms based there. The other is host country data on the activities of foreign-owned firms
within their borders. Each type of data has advantages and drawbacks. The home country data have
the advantage of comparability across host countries and coverage of all host countries, although not
always in published form for each of them individually. The U.S. data have a high degree of coverage of

Development Institute and Prof. Yuzo Honda of Osaka University, the discussants at the meeting, and to

U.S. investing firms and extensive published descriptions of the data. Unfortunately, few home countries
collect such data and among those few, Japan issues data that are deficient in many respects
(Ramstetter, 1996, and Lipsey, Blomström, and Ramstetter, 1998). The U.S. data, despite their high
quality, suffer from the extensive suppression of information for confidentiality reasons, especially for
individual countries, industries, and industries within countries. Because of the suppressions, we
alternate here between two definitions of developing Asia. One is called by that name and covers all
Asia and Oceania except the Middle East, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. The other consists of
eight individual entities, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea (South), Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.
These account for over 85 percent of sales of U.S. affiliates in “Developing Asia.”
Host country data have the advantage of comparability within each country. There is
comparability between information on foreign-owned firms or establishments and on domesticallyowned ones and among data for establishments owned by different home countries. They are
presumably comparable with respect to definitions, such as those for sales, employment, wages, value
added, and other variables, and also with respect to industry definitions. However, there are differences
from host country to host country in industry coverage, size or type of firm coverage, and in definitions
of concepts and industries, so that regional summations are questionable. For that reason, this paper,
with its concentration on the region, is based mainly on home country data, but some comparisons with
host country data are added in the discussions of individual countries.
This paper is focussed mainly on the role of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the
development of the exports of their host countries, with some attention also to their role in the
development of host country production. One reason for this focus is that MNEs play a particularly

2

large role in trade, larger than in host country production, at least in manufacturing and mining, and
especially larger than in employment. Another reason is that there exists, in comprehensive and long
term series on the trade of individual countries, classified by product, a natural basis for comparison
between the activities of the MNEs and those of other firms within host countries. Some much less
detailed data are available on production in some host countries, covering shorter time periods than
those of the trade data.
An additional difference between production for export and production for host country
domestic sales is that export production is probably more footloose and less under the influence of host
country governments’ restrictions than production for local sale, although export production can be
influenced by host country incentives. Given that incentives are expensive to host governments, the
pattern of exports may reflect the comparative advantages of the host countries better than the more
easily influenced production for domestic use.
An earlier examination of the role of multinational firms in developing country trade concluded
that in the late 1960s and the 1970s, when exports of manufactured goods by developing Asian
countries grew by almost 800 per cent, U.S. affiliates were the sources of about 6&1/2 per cent of that
growth, and of an increasing share of exports. Up to 1983, the export growth of these countries was to
almost 20 times the 1966 level and U.S. firms accounted for a little over 6 per cent of the increase.
Over a shorter period, from 1974 to 1983, Japanese firms’ affiliates were responsible for another 7 per
cent, so that the two sets of foreign firms together may have been responsible for about 13 per cent of
the export growth, not an insignificant share but certainly not a dominant one ( Blomström, Lipsey, and
Kravis, 1988).

The roles of the two countries’ MNCs in developing Asia in these early years become clearer if
we look at the industry distribution of manufactured exports. Between 1966 and 1977, for example,
the Asian developing countries remained predominantly exporters in “Other manufacturing,” mainly
textiles and apparel, which made up half of the enormous growth in their manufactured exports. U.S.
firms’ manufacturing affiliates in these countries played no role in this export growth, and if we judge by
their 1977 share, discussed below, Japanese affiliates could not been very important either. There were
two major changes in export composition. One was a shift out of food products, an industry in which
U.S. affiliates were unimportant, and, by 1977, so were Japanese affiliates. The other was a move into
machinery, which grew from 4 to 14 per cent of exports. More than a quarter of the growth in
machinery exports, and a higher proportion of that in electrical machinery, was in exports by U.S.
affiliates in these countries (Lipsey and Kravis, 1985, Table A-6). The 1977 data suggest that Japanese
affiliates played a negligible role in nonelectrical machinery, but a larger one in the growth of exports of
electrical machinery.

Developing Asia as a Whole in 1977
The export pattern of developing Asia in manufacturing as of 1977 and the position of U.S. and
Japanese affiliates in manufactured exports at that point are summarized in Table 1. The Japanese
affiliate data are subject to major problems, worse for the industry distribution than for the total, but
serious for the total too, as is explained in Ramstetter (1996) and in Lipsey, Blomström, and Ramstetter
(1998). However, the general outlines of the picture are probably correct.
The developing Asian countries were, within manufacturing, still predominantly exporters of
Foods and “Other manufactures” in 1977. These industries were the source of over two thirds of their
4

manufactured exports and, with Metals, three quarters of the total. Electrical machinery had already
reached some importance, at 13 per cent of the total. The specializations of Japanese and U.S.
manufacturing affiliates in this group of countries were different from those of the countries and from
each other. Japanese affiliate exports were relatively larger than U.S. affiliate exports in Transport
equipment, and particularly in Other manufacturing, mainly Textiles and apparel, almost half of Japanese
affiliate exports. U.S. affiliate exports were more concentrated in Electrical machinery, which made up
two thirds of U.S. affiliate exports, and to a smaller extent in Chemicals and Nonelectrical machinery.
In their relatively large shares in Foods and especially in Textiles and apparel and the rest of
Other manufacturing, the export pattern of the Japanese affiliates was much closer than that of the U.S.
affiliates to the comparative advantage of the host countries. Relative to the exports of the host
countries, those of U.S. affiliates were extremely high in Electrical machinery, and a little high also in
Chemicals and in Nonelectrical machinery, all industry groups of U.S. home-country export
comparative advantage, and also relatively R&D-intensive industries. Thus, one could say that, as of
the mid-1970s, both U.S. and Japanese affiliates, but especially the U.S. affiliates, were pushing the
Asian host countries toward specialization in Electrical machinery. Japanese affiliates differed from U.S.
affiliates in being much more involved in exploiting the traditional comparative advantages of these host
countries.
U.S. and Japanese affiliates together were responsible for 14 per cent of the region’s
manufactured exports, but the share varied widely across industries. Despite the concentration of
Japanese affiliate exports in Other manufacturing, they were a minor part of total exports in this industry
group. In Electrical machinery, however, the two countries’ affiliates were responsible for over half of

5

their host countries’ exports, and affiliates accounted for between 10 and 15 per cent of total exports in
Chemicals, Nonelectrical machinery, and Transport equipment.
The comparative advantages of U.S. and Japanese affiliates relative to their host countries are
described by the ratios in the last two columns of Table 1. Both countries’ affiliates had large
comparative advantages relative to their host countries in Electrical machinery. U.S. affiliates, but not
Japanese affiliates, also had them in Chemicals and Nonelectrical machinery, and Japanese, but not U.S.
affiliates, in Transport equipment and, more surprisingly, in Textiles and apparel.
The industry distributions of production, as measured by gross product, for U.S. affiliates and of
sales for U.S. and Japanese affiliates are shown in Table 2. There are no comparable data for
production and sales in the region. As was the case for exports, U.S. affiliate sales were more
concentrated in Foods, Chemicals, and Machinery and Japanese affiliate sales in Metals, Transport
equipment, and Other manufacturing, particularly Textiles and apparel. The most extreme
concentrations in industry distribution that were seen for exports, such as for U.S. and Japanese
affiliates in Electrical machinery and for Japanese affiliates in Other manufacturing, are somewhat muted
in production and sales, although they are still visible.
The difference between the industry distributions for exports and for sales implies that
export/sales ratios, or export orientation, differ among the industries. As can be seen by comparing
Tables 1 and 2, U.S. affiliates were far more export-oriented than Japanese affiliates in Metals and in
both Machinery groups, with Electrical machinery the least focussed on its host-country markets, selling
only 15 per cent or less there. In the Food industry, Japanese affiliates exported a little more than half
of their sales, considerably more than U.S. affiliates did, and in Chemicals, Transport equipment, and
Other manufacturing the export ratios of the two countries’ affiliates were similar. For the most part (6
6

out of 8 industries), higher shares of an industry in exports by one country’s affiliates were associated
with higher export/sales ratios in that country’s affiliates. U.S. firms’ machinery affiliates’ were the only
group exporting far more than they sold in their host countries. Other high export ratios were found in
Foods, Japanese Electrical and Nonelectrical machinery affiliates, and both countries’ affiliates in Other
manufacturing.
Thus, by 1977, there was a group of foreign-owned affiliates that had been drawn to
Developing Asia to produce for export and another, smaller group, mainly in Chemicals and Transport
equipment, drawn there by prospects in selling to the host countries themselves. The exporting activities
of the affiliates that did export only accounted for about 14 per cent of the region’s exports because
most of the region’s exports were in Foods, Metals, and Other manufacturing, where foreign firms
seemed to have little advantage over local firms.

The Trade of Individual Countries in 1977
The export patterns of eight East Asian countries had one common feature in the mid-1970s, as
is shown in Table 3. Exports of Food products and Other manufacturing were more than half of total
manufactured exports in every country except Singapore. But there were also some sharp differences.
In the four NIEs, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, led by Singapore, Electrical machinery
accounted for at least 10 per cent of exports. Malaysia was not far behind, but in the other three
countries, Electrical machinery exports were a minor part of the total, less than 4 per cent.
Nonelectrical machinery was much less important than Electrical machinery but the comparative
advantages seemed to be related. Three of the four countries in which Electrical machinery made up a
large part of exports were also the ones with the largest shares of their exports in Nonelectrical
7

machinery. However, comparative advantage in Chemicals, the other group in which R&D is relatively
high, appears to be unrelated to that in machinery.
Thus, even by 1977, the region was dividing into two groups of countries. One, consisting of
four or five countries, was, with the participation of foreign affiliates, moving into the export of
machinery and chemicals. The other group showed little indication of a move away from their traditional
export specializations.

The Growth of the Region’s Production and Exports, 1977-1995
The story of Developing Asia’s growth over the 15 or 20 years after 1977 is a familiar one.
The eight countries of Table 3 grew more than twice as fast, in terms of their GDP, as the world as a
whole. Their exports of manufactured goods grew to 16 times the 1977 level by 1995 and their share
of world manufactured exports from 6 per cent to 15 per cent (18 per cent if China was added). The
composition of the eight countries’ exports changed drastically, with Foods and Other manufacturing
declining from 68 per cent to 38 per cent and Machinery rising from 17 per cent to 44 per cent (Table
4). While 41 per cent of the increase in exports was in the older sectors Foods, Metals, and Other
manufacturing, more than half of the growth came from the Chemicals and Machinery sectors.
Another way of describing the export patterns is by the extent to which exports are the product
of industries characterized by high, medium, or low ratios of R&D expenditures to output, recognizing
that the particular products that make up a country’s exports in one of these industries may not
themselves be the ones resulting from the R&D. The U.S. parent companies investing in Developing
Asia, even in 1977, were not only in relatively high R&D industries but, within those industries, were
R&D-intensive relative to other firms. Parents in the Nonelectrical machinery industry with direct
8

investments in Developing Asia in 1977 were over 50 per cent more R&D-intensive than those with
investments in Europe, the next-highest area in this respect. Parents in the Electrical machinery industry
with direct investments in Developing Asia were almost 40 per cent more R&D-intensive than those
with European investments (Lipsey, Blomström, and Kravis, 1990).
The exports of the eight developing East Asian countries in 1977 were mostly from industries of
low R&D intensity. The main ones were Foods, Metals, and, within the broad Other manufacturing
group, Textiles and apparel, Lumber and furniture, and Leather and leather products. By 1995, the
export distributions, especially those of Singapore, Malaysia, and Taiwan, were much more tilted
toward high R&D industries. The shares of high R&D industries in the manufacturing exports of
Singapore and Malaysia were far above those in the exports of the United States and Japan, and their
share in Taiwan’s exports was a little above that for those two high-tech leaders. In all the East Asian
countries, except Indonesia, the share of high R&D-intensity industries in manufactured exports was
higher than in such advanced countries in Europe as France and Germany (Table 5).
What role, if any, did the affiliates of U.S. and Japanese companies play in these
transformations? From 1977 to 1995, the region’s dependence on U.S. affiliates for exporting, never
large, declined. The share of U.S. affiliates in total manufactured exports declined from 7 per cent to
about 5&1/2 per cent. In 1977, U.S. affiliates accounted for more than 4 per cent of East Asian
exports only in Chemicals and Machinery, concentrated in a share of more than a third in Electrical
machinery. By 1995, the two machinery industries were the only ones with U.S. affiliate shares over 4
per cent (Table 6). The role of U.S. affiliates in the region’s exports shrank substantially in both
Chemicals and Electrical machinery, but grew in Nonelectrical machinery to 18-20 per cent. These
changes can also be seen in the shares of U.S. affiliates in the growth of exports, large in both machinery
9

industries in the first period, from 1977 to 1982, around 15 and 25 per cent, but after that concentrated
in the Nonelectrical machinery sector. In that industry, U.S. affiliates still accounted for about 20 per
cent of export growth in 1989-1995, but the U.S. affiliate share was below 6 per cent in the other
broad industry groups.
These broad industry group categories and aggregations of countries conceal differences among
individual industries and individual countries. Many of these are hidden in the published data by
suppression rules, but for a few industries we can compare total sales, including both exports and local
sales, by U.S. affiliates in Asian countries other than Japan and Australia, but including New Zealand,
with total exports by the eight East Asian countries. A high ratio of affiliate sales to exports could mean
that the industry is dominated by the U.S. affiliates or it could mean that the U.S. affiliates are producing
for sale in the host country rather than for export. The available information on these affiliate sales ratios
by industry is shown in Table 7. The high ratio for Soaps, Cleansers, and Toilet goods, far over 100 per
cent, indicates that U.S. affiliates in the industry are focussed on host country markets, rather than
export markets. Within Electrical machinery, the U.S. affiliates’ importance is concentrated in
Electronic components and accessories.
Japanese affiliates accounted for a little less of Southeast Asia’s exports than U.S. affiliates in
each of the years for which we can make a comparison, through 1989 and their share of the region’s
exports also declined. After that, however, their exports and their shares of the region’s exports rose
sharply through 1995, considerably surpassing those of U.S. MOFAs (Table 8). The major differences
among industries were that the Japanese affiliates were a negligible factor in exports of Nonelectrical
machinery, the industry in which U.S. affiliates were most important as exporters in 1995, but were
more important than U.S. affiliates in exports of every other industry group, particularly Transport
10

equipment and Electrical machinery. The original Japanese share in Textile and apparel exports almost
vanished between 1977 and 1989.
The region’s dependence on U.S. and Japanese affiliates together as sources of exports
declined between 1977 and 1989 from about 13&1/2 per cent to 10&1/2 per cent, and then rose again
to almost 13 per cent with the large growth in exporting by Japanese affiliates. The combined U.S. and
Japanese affiliate shares fell in four or five of the seven industry groups, most notably in Electrical
machinery, where the affiliates were responsible for over half of exports in 1977 but only 22 per cent in
the mid-1990s, indicating some maturing of the domestic industry. The outstanding exception was
Nonelectrical machinery, where the affiliate share grew to over 20 per cent by 1989 and remained close
to that level in the next six years. Thus, at the regional level, there seems to have been some growing
out of dependence on foreign affiliates, except in the case of U.S. affiliates in Nonelectrical machinery,
mainly involved in computer related products.

Production and Exports in Individual Countries
Although East Asia has been treated here so far mainly as a unit, there are large differences
among the countries. A separation by country gives a picture of the differences and also provides a
larger number of observations.
Singapore has been the country most dependent on U.S. affiliates as exporters, with their share
close to 20 per cent in 1977 and 1995 (Table 9). The Philippines are next, still at about 7 per cent, and
in Malaysia these shares were high in 1982 but fell sharply after that. In Hong Kong and Taiwan, and
even more in Indonesia and Korea, U.S. affiliate shares in manufactured exports were low and falling,

11

although U.S. affiliates were important as exporters in Indonesia’s petroleum industry, not included in
the manufacturing totals here.
The great importance of U.S. affiliates in the Electronics industry, especially in the early stages
of development of the industry, stands out in the table. At the first appearance of the industry in the data
here, which does not mean the beginning of the industry itself for the earlier entrants, the shares of U.S.
affiliates are very high. They range from 97 per cent in the Philippines (ignoring the anomalous 1982
ratio, which shows the affiliates exporting almost twice the national total), to three quarters in Malaysia
and Thailand in 1982, over half in Singapore and close to 30 per cent in Hong Kong and Taiwan in
1977. Only Indonesia and Korea show no such high ratios, and Indonesia hardly entered the industry.
After those initial high ratios, which suggest that the U.S. firms were the initiators of the industries in
these countries, the role of the U.S. affiliates diminished sharply in the most successful exporting
countries, to 3 per cent in Hong Kong, 6 per cent in Singapore and 7 per cent in Taiwan.
On a smaller scale, the Chemicals industries went through a similar evolution, although the U.S.
affiliate shares of exports were never as high and the pattern was not as consistent. The shares did
decline from 12 to 3&1/2 per cent in Hong Kong, 18 to 3 per cent in Taiwan, 27 to 1&1/2 per cent in
Indonesia, 8 to 1&1/2 per cent in Malaysia, and 42 to 5 per cent in the Philippines. In this case also,
the affiliates may have been teachers with apt students.
The major exception to the pattern of receding importance of U.S. affiliates as exporters is the
Nonelectrical machinery industry in Singapore. The industry was already an important exporter in 1977
and the share of U.S. affiliates in 1982, the first year we can calculate it, was over 30 per cent. That
share grew to 37 and 45 per cent in 1989 and 1995 even as the industry’s share in Singapore’s exports

12

grew steadily from 11 per cent in 1977 to over a third in 1995. In the last period, U.S. affiliates
accounted for almost half of Singapore’s export growth in this industry.
The declining role of affiliates in the region’s exports does not necessarily mean that there were
similar declines in their role in production. As their export role was declining, U.S. affiliates were being
naturalized, in the sense that they were selling more of their production in host country markets (Table
10). The overall exports/sales ratios for U.S. manufacturing affiliates fell in six out of the seven countries
for which they could be calculated between 1977 and 1995 and also, more often than not, in individual
industry groups within countries. Shifts toward host country markets over time were more common
than shifts toward export markets in each industry in each period in each country, wherever the data
were available. That predominance suggests that production for export preceded production for host
country markets on the part of the U.S. MNEs. Perhaps the MNEs were more knowledgeable about
export markets than about host country markets or perhaps host country markets did not develop until
after production for exports had begun. The export production itself may have stimulated the growth of
host country markets in general or in the same industries.
Japanese manufacturing affiliates in East Asia have generally been less export-oriented than U.S.
affiliates. About a third of their sales were outside host countries in 1977 (Tables 1 and 2), as
compared with 57 per cent for U.S. affiliates. In 1995, the export/sales ratio for U.S. affiliates was
down to 54 per cent (Appendix Table 2) and those for Japanese affiliates were up to 43&1/2 per cent
in the NIEs and 38 per cent in the ASEAN-4 (Appendix Table 4). Thus the Japanese affiliates have
become a little more like the U.S. affiliates as time passed. Among the major industries, Japanese
affiliates were much less export oriented in Non-electrical machinery than U.S. affiliates in 1995, but
had become considerably more export-oriented in Electrical machinery.
13

Some of the country studies in Dobson and Chia (1997) offer a closer look at trade-investment
relations in Southeast Asia, particularly in the two machinery industries. In Singapore, for example, in a
category called “Electronic products and accessories,” which encompasses most of the two machinery
groups in our tables, foreign affiliates accounted for almost 90 per cent of the capital. Over 90 per cent
of sales were exports and constituted almost 80 per cent of Singapore’s manufactured exports in 1995
(Chia, 1997, and Appendix Table 7). U.S. and European affiliates were particularly export-oriented
and each group sent about half its exports to its home region (ibid, Table 2.8). Japanese affiliates, more
involved in consumer electronics, sold the highest proportion locally among all the foreign-owned
operations. Chia concludes that the data demonstrate “…differences in U.S. and Japanese corporate
strategies for offshore production, the former to supply the home and third-country markets, the latter to
supply largely the host and third-country markets…” (p. 449).
A study of a sample of foreign-owned firms in Taiwan by Tu (1997) covering electronics and
chemicals firms did not find such large differences in export behavior between U.S. and Japanese
affiliates as in the Singapore study but did note two points that help to explain aggregate behavior. One
is the effect of the age of an affiliate. Younger affiliates relied much more than older affiliates on their
home markets; as an affiliate matured, and perhaps as the local market matured at the same time, it
tended to sell more in its local market. This process could be one explanation for the similar tendency
visible in the aggregate data. A more disturbing finding in this study is that affiliates reported as sales to
parents products that were actually shipped to third countries. Such a practice would put into question
the reliability of the division between exports to home countries and exports to third countries (Tu,
1997, p. 75).

14

The study of foreign firms in Hong Kong in the same volume, also based on a non-random
sample survey, suggested large differences between U.S. and Japanese firm behavior, as was reported
for Singapore (Chen and Wong, 1997). Japanese affiliates were more tightly tied to their parents in the
sense that more of their exports went to them, while U.S. affiliates sold somewhat more to other
affiliates and much more to unrelated firms. Japanese affiliates were also more dependent on their
parents for “… the supply of capital, machinery, components, and parts…” (ibid, p.91). One gets the
impression that U.S. firms have gone further than have Japanese firms in the division of labor among
affiliates.
In Thailand, the differences between U.S. and Japanese firms do not appear as large
(Ramstetter, 1997). Both are focussed substantially on their home markets, although that dependence
has been rising for Japanese firms and declining for U.S. affiliates. Japanese affiliates are much more
important than U.S. affiliates, accounting for 22 per cent of Thai exports of non-petroleum manufactured
exports, as compared with 8 per cent for U.S. affiliates. Exports are concentrated in electric and
computing machinery (Non-electrical machinery in the aggregate data), especially on the part of U.S.
affiliates (pp. 122-123).
Japanese affiliates in the electrical and electronic industries in Malaysia differed from U.S. and
European affiliates in being to a larger extent producers of final products, and much less exporters to
home markets (Sieh and Yew, 1997, pp.138-139). U.S. affiliates purchased few inputs from unrelated
suppliers in third countries but much more from affiliates in those countries, the main reason being that
“… U.S. affiliates as semiconductor producers were higher up on the value-added chain and could use
imports only from their proprietary sources whereas Japanese firms turning out intermediate products
half way down the value-added chain had more procurement options…” (p. 140). One U.S. firm was
15

described as having “… a no duplication policy, which divided production activities among affiliates in
different locations to avoid duplicating the output of another affiliate…” (p. 140).
In a study of the location of export production by U.S. and Japanese MNEs Kumar (1997)
distinguished between production for export to the MNEs’ home markets and production for export to
the rest of the world., and found some differences in determinants for the two types and between
Japanese and U.S. firm practices. Although the study is not specific to FDI in Asia, Kumar attempted
to measure the attractiveness of the “…first generation of NIEs…” and of a “second tier,” the
ASEAN-4 and China. One conclusion is that the first generation NIEs were favored by U.S. MNEs
over other locations for production for the U.S. market in 1982 and 1989, but that they had lost their
advantage by 1994. “Favored” in that study means favored beyond the degree expected from the
measured determinants of export production location. These same countries were attractive to
Japanese MNEs in 1989, but not before, and they had lost that advantage by 1994. The explanation
offered is that export-oriented investment was discouraged by the combination of “…rising wages,
appreciating currencies, loss of GSP benefits and MFA quotas…” At the same time, coefficients
representing membership in the “second tier” in equations explaining exports to U.S. and Japanese
markets were increasing over time. Among industry groups, these trends were clearest, and the
coefficients most frequently statistically significant for U.S. affiliates in the Electrical machinery industry,
confirming the impression from the data reported here.
Kumar also suggests that there are differences in the behavior of U.S. and Japanese affiliates, as
appears to be the case in our data here. His interpretation is that “…U.S. MNEs tend to relocate
production of intermediate products for home consumption, whereas Japanese MNEs seem to shift
production of more finished goods in relatively simpler technology industries. The offshore production
16

by U.S. MNEs would seem from this more of ‘globalized production’ which links subsidiaries in home
and host countries vertically.” ( pp. 33-34). This picture of the close relationships between parents and
affiliates within U.S. firms fits with the finding in Lipsey (1998) that exports to individual markets from
U.S. affiliates in Asian countries are larger when parent exports to affiliates in those markets are also
large. This phenomenon was particularly noticeable in the Electronic components and accessories
industry, part of the Electrical machinery industry reported on here.

Conclusions
The composition of manufacturing production and of the manufactured exports of Southeast
Asian countries has been completely transformed over the last 20 years or so. To varying degrees, these
countries went from a pattern of exports within manufacturing fairly typical of developing countries to
one much more like that of highly developed countries. In some cases they have moved quite far up the
scale into R&D-intensive industries, although not necessarily in the more sophisticated sectors of these
industries. Foods, Textiles and apparel, and Other manufactures, mainly labor-intensive products of
industries of low R&D intensity, declined from almost 68 per cent of exports to 38 per cent, and
exports from the Chemicals and Machinery industries rose from 21 per cent to more than half of
exports. In all the countries, the share of exports from R&D intensive industries at least doubled and in
most cases grew much more than that.
It would be hard to explain these changes by the initial comparative advantages of these
countries in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The decisions to welcome foreign firms as direct investors,
taken at different times and to different degrees among the countries, seem to have been a crucial
element in these developments. Foreign firms, particularly American firms at the beginning, saw a way
17

to integrate these countries into worldwide networks of production, first in electronics and then in
aspects of the computer industry. Foreign firms supplied the technology and the links to other parts of
the production networks that completed the set of resources necessary for the growth of these
industries. The most typical pattern seemed to be the establishment of affiliates almost completely for
export production, followed by the development of these affiliates over time to produce more for
domestic sale, and by the growth of production by non-affiliated host country firms in the same or
related industries.
Although this is a general description, each country has its own story. Indonesia does not fit the
pattern except a bit for Chemicals. Korea looks to be a country that transformed almost entirely
without inward FDI, although the paper in this volume by Kim and Huang suggests that there was more
influence from that source than is visible from our data. The smallest countries have been, as we would
expect, most dependent on trade for the growth of these industries.
U.S. and Japanese firms seem to have played somewhat different roles. U.S. firms were earlier
major investors and their investments and affiliate exports were distributed across industries along the
lines of U.S. comparative advantage, while the industry distribution of Japanese affiliate production and
exports was closer to that of the host countries. Thus the U.S. investments initially did more to drive the
changes in the composition of their host countries’ production and trade. Over time, however, the U.S.
and Japanese affiliates have become more alike in transmitting home country technologies and
comparative advantages, the U.S. firms more in computer equipment, the Japanese more in motor
vehicles, and both in electronics.
It is a little difficult to match the growth of exports by foreign-owned affiliates in these countries
with the total export growth. Of the two fast-growing machinery sectors, in Electrical machinery, U.S.
18

and Japanese affiliates alone were responsible for half of exports in 1977 and their share diminished in
the next 20 years. In Nonelectrical machinery, mainly computers and accessories and parts, the share
of the two home countries’ affiliates, chiefly U.S. affiliates, increased substantially between 1977 and
1995.
By 1995, the two machinery industries’ exports were 30 per cent or more of total manufactured
exports in seven out of the eight countries we cover here. The exception is Indonesia, where
“…investments in export-oriented electronic components by multinational enterprises (MNEs) failed to
take off…because of the lack of a conducive investment climate between 1973 and 1985.” Two
semiconductor investments that had been established by major American firms were closed in 1985-86
(Pangestu, 1997, p.204). In the other seven countries, except for Korea, which seems to have
managed without much inward FDI, the earliest data for the Electrical Machinery industry show large
initial shares in exports for U.S. affiliates alone (we do not have individual country data for Japanese
affiliates). The large early affiliate shares of exports were followed by declines in every case. The data
seem to say that the U.S. affiliates were extremely important in the initial stages of this now major
industry for the region, but have been replaced to some extent, at least in their export roles, by firms
from other home countries, especially Japan, and by local firms. While their role in exports was
declining, U.S. affiliates were shifting their sales to their host country markets to some extent.
A somewhat similar pattern of initially high U.S. affiliate shares in exports, declining in later
years, can be observed in the Chemicals industry, although the shares were never as high as in Electrical
machinery, and the U.S. affiliates in Chemicals were always much more oriented to their host-country
markets than those in Electrical machinery.

19

The major exception to this trend was the Nonelectrical machinery industry, mainly computers
and parts. In this case, the share of U.S. affiliates in the region’s exports grew over time. The industry
was particularly important as an exporter in Taiwan, where it was a larger exporter than Electrical
machinery, and in Singapore, where it was a little smaller. The U.S. and Japanese data are not available
in sufficient industry detail to test whether what appear to be differences in behavior are explainable by
the detailed industry composition of their investments, and the data that do exist are undermined by
differences in consolidation rules, by the extent of transshipments with little value added, and by many
other problems. There do seem to be many individual cases where detailed industry composition is the
explanation, as in the distinction between consumer electronics and semiconductor specializations in
individual countries within the Electrical machinery industry, which seems to explain the extent of
exporting relative to host-country sales.
The declining share of U..S. and Japanese affiliates in exports of most manufacturing industries
in East Asia does not reflect any withdrawal from the region or decline in affiliate activity. Exports by
U.S.-owned affiliates grew by almost 12 times their original level between 1977 and 1995 and by 20
per cent in 1995 alone. Local sales in host countries grew even faster. Exports by Japanese affiliates
grew by 17 times their original value during the same period and more than tripled between 1989 and
1995. The declines in affiliate shares of exports over time reflect the enormous growth of local firms
and of other countries’ affiliates, particularly the former, and the local firm growth may itself have been
partly a result of the growth of the U.S. and Japanese affiliates.
