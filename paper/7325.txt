Stock Repurchases in Canada: Performance and Strategic Trading

NBER Working Paper No. 7325
August 1999
JEL No. G14, G32
ABSTRACT
During the 1980s, U.S. firms that announced stock repurchase programs earned favorable long-run
returns. Recently, concerns have been raised regarding the robustness of these findings. This comes at a
time of explosive worldwide growth in the adoption of repurchase programs. This study provides out-ofsample evidence for 1,060 Canadian repurchase programs announced between 1989 and 1997. As in the
U.S., the Canadian stock market seems to discount the information contained in repurchase
announcements. Value stocks announcing repurchase programs have particularly favorable returns.
Canadian law requires companies to report how many shares they repurchase on a monthly basis. We find
that managers are sensitive to mispricing as completion rates are higher in cases where undervaluation may
be a more important factor. Moreover, trades are linked to price movements; managers buy more shares
when prices fall and reduce their buying when prices rise.

1. Introduction
In recent years, corporations have dramatically increased the amount of capital devoted to
repurchasing their own shares. In the mid-1980s, repurchase program announcements in the U.S.
amounted to roughly $25 billion per year. Between 1996 and 1998 however, more than 4,000 open
market repurchase programs were announced which, if fully completed, amount to roughly $550 billion. 1
During the first quarter of 1999 alone, Securities Data Company reports nearly 350 program
announcements totalling $40 billion. Interest in corporate repurchase programs is not limited to the U.S.
as repurchase activity worldwide has grown in recent years. Countries such as Hong Kong and Japan
recently implemented new regulations allowing companies for the first time to repurchase their shares. A
recent Goldman Sachs study (March 1999) foresees stock repurchases becoming more common in
Europe and discusses the potential impact on European equity values.
The literature is rich with motives as to why firms might repurchase their own stock. The list
includes, for example, tax benefits, distributing excess cash and adjusting capital structure. Yet these
reasons are not as popular with managers who often suggest when announcing buyback programs that
current market prices are too low and hence their stock is an attractive investment (Dann (1983) and
Wansley, Lane, and Sarkar (1989)). Several studies report evidence consistent with this managerial story
of undervaluation. In a comprehensive examination of U.S. open market repurchase programs during the
1980s, Ikenberry, Lakonishok and Vermaelen (1995) find that the market's initial response to repurchase
announcements is not complete. They report annualized abnormal performance of 2.9% over a four-year
period following the announcement. For value stocks, where a stronger case can be made for

For comparison, the NYSE reports that aggregate cash dividends paid by member firms over this period was
approximately $490 billion.

1

2
undervaluation, the annual abnormal return was 6.4% over the same post-announcement period. 2
Although previous studies have examined hundreds of repurchase program announcements, the
history of this transaction is rather short, only becoming pervasive in the U.S. in the late 1980s.
Moreover, international evidence regarding repurchases is limited as many countries have only recently
allowed firms to repurchase stock. Thus, a degree of skepticism regarding the existing evidence on share
repurchases is warranted. As Merton (1985) suggests, we are biased toward publishing "exciting" results.
Indeed, recent papers have drawn into question the results of several studies that examine long-run stock
performance because of the sensitivity of the results to the methods used to calculate abnormal returns.3
Studies on stock repurchases have been included in these critiques.
Given the recent growth in repurchase activity worldwide, fresh evidence on long-run
performance of repurchasing firms is of interest. While many countries now allow repurchases, the only
country outside the U.S. that has a reasonable sample at this point is Canada. Thus, we examine open
market programs announced by firms trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE). Moreover, we
utilize programs announced between 1989 and 1997, a time period that generally follows the sample
period examined in earlier U.S. studies. Our sample is comprehensive and contains 1,060 program
announcements authorizing $35 billion in repurchases. This analysis is supplemented with evidence of
long-run stock performance following the issuance of shares. Specifically, we consider Canadian
seasoned equity offerings and acquisitions that were at least partially financed with equity. A result
consistent with repurchases would show a downward drift in stock performance after an announcement
of an increase in shares outstanding.

2

In an earlier paper on fixed-price tender offer repurchases, Lakonishok and Vermaelen (1990) also find evidence
of positive abnormal returns lasting at least two years following the announcement.
3

For example, Fama (1998) and Mitchell and Stafford (1997).

3
Canadian data is of particular interest, however, because firms must report each month the
number of shares they actually repurchase. This information is summarized by the exchanges and
published on a timely basis. Precise, periodic information on repurchase activity does not exist for U.S.
firms. Moreover, U.S. reporting conventions even make it difficult to obtain good estimates of overall
completion rates (Stephens and Weisbach (1998)). Our unique data allow us to accurately measure
program completion rates and examine factors that affect these managerial decisions.
Access to monthly repurchase data allows us to study whether managers execute share
repurchases strategically in response to market movements. Managers repurchase stock for a variety of
reasons, many of which may not relate to mispricing. For example, to the extent that firms repurchase
shares to avoid dilution in earnings from the exercise of options, or use repurchases as a tax efficient
alternative to paying cash dividends, one would not expect to find a relation between price movements
and the level of repurchase activity in a given month. Also, if managers view the market as efficient, we
would not expect them to react to price movements. However, managers often mention undervaluation
as an important motive for repurchasing shares. To the extent that they believe prices deviate from their
intrinsic value, we expect to observe managers repurchasing shares more aggressively when prices are
falling. Likewise, we expect the incentive to repurchase shares to diminish after a rise in prices. Data
from Canada enable us to assess the extent to which managers trade strategically and thus should help us
better understand what motivates repurchase activity.
We find that undervaluation appears to be just as important a consideration for repurchasing
shares in Canada as earlier findings suggest for the U.S. Using the Fama-French (1993) three-factor
model, Canadian firms repurchasing shares show abnormal performance of 0.59% per month over a
three-year period following the announcement. In the year prior to the announcement, abnormal returns
are negative, -0.35% per month. Such poor pre-announcement performance and subsequent out

4
performance are consistent with undervaluation being a motivating factor for stock repurchases. A
stronger case for undervaluation as a motive for repurchasing shares can be made for value stocks. The
results are consistent with this hypothesis. Canadian value stocks that announce repurchases experience
abnormal returns of 0.76% per month whereas the comparable return for growth stocks is only 0.28% per
month.
We also evaluate performance subsequent to an increase in shares where firms either issued
seasoned equity or acquired other firms with stock. Here, the results are again consistent with the notion
that mispricing is a factor in managerial decision making. Abnormal returns are high prior to SEOs or
equity-financed acquisitions made by TSE firms, yet subsequent abnormal return performance is
substantially negative.
The results suggest that managers trade strategically. Price changes seem to have a major
impact on repurchase activity. Consistent with the undervaluation story, an increase in prices leads to a
reduction in the number of shares repurchased, whereas a drop in stock prices leads to a larger fraction
of shares repurchased. Completion rates are also higher for value stocks than for growth stocks.
Moreover, firms that actively repurchased shares experience only modest returns while the program was
in effect. Yet, these firms enjoy sizeable abnormal returns in subsequent years. Conversely, companies
that did not buy any shares show strikingly large excess returns while the program is in effect, yet no
evidence of positive abnormal returns in subsequent years. Overall, the results suggest that managers'
repurchase decisions are sensitive to prevailing market prices, a result consistent with the undervaluation
hypothesis.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the institutional setting surrounding
repurchase programs in Canada and also describes how we formed our sample. Section 3 reviews the
methodology used to evaluate long-run performance. Section 4 provides descriptive information regarding
sample programs and documents the short-run market reaction to repurchase announcements. Section 5

5
presents evidence on subsequent long-run performance. Section 6 reports evidence on program
repurchase completion rates and the extent to which managers execute repurchase programs
strategically. Section 7 further examines the strategic nature of repurchase decisions by examining longrun performance conditional on various levels of repurchase activity. Section 8 provides results for the
opposing case where managers issue equity either through SEOs or stock-financed acquisitions.
Concluding remarks are provided in section 9.

2. Repurchases in Canada
a. Institutional aspects of repurchases in Canada
The regulatory environment affecting Canadian open market repurchase programs differs from
that in the U.S. In Canada, these programs are referred to as "Normal Course Issuer Bids." The primary
oversight mechanism for these programs is provided by the exchange where the company's stock trades.
Unlike U.S. firms, Canadian firms must receive approval from the exchange before initiating a repurchase
program. The application process to repurchase stock at the TSE is generally straightforward and is
usually completed in a limited number of days. As in the U.S., these programs are the most common
mechanism firms use to repurchase shares.4 Once authorized, programs last one year and are limited to
the maximum of either 10% of public float or 5% of shares outstanding. Thus, in many cases, the number
of authorized shares exceeds 5% of the share base.
TSE rules also govern how listed firms execute their repurchase programs.5 Briefly, these rules

4

Fixed-price tender offers, referred to as "Substantial Issuer Bids," are also permitted in Canada and do not have
limits on the amount of stock that can be repurchased. As in the U.S., this form of repurchase is not common.
Dutch-auction tender offers, though permitted by law, have only recently occurred in Canada. In this study, we only
examine repurchase programs executed via open market transactions, or Normal Course Issuer Bids.

6
state that TSE firms may commence repurchasing stock two days after receiving approval from the TSE.
Programs must be executed through a single broker. Cumulative repurchases over the trailing 30
calendar days must not exceed 2% of the outstanding shares. Firms are also restricted from repurchasing
shares on an up-tick. Similar rules exist in the U.S. 6
b. The Sample
We obtained the complete record of common stock repurchase programs announced by TSElisted firms between 1989 and 1997. Information regarding all authorized repurchase programs is
published periodically in The Daily Record, a TSE publication. Once a month, the TSE publishes a
comprehensive overview of the status of all authorized programs including the program's size, termination
date, the number of share purchased in the previous month (including those purchased on other
exchanges) and the total shares repurchased to date in the program. During this time period, 1,159
program authorizations were announced by TSE firms.
Monthly stock returns were obtained from the TSE/University of Western Ontario database, a
dataset free of survivor bias. However, our returns from this database end in December 1995. Thus,
from January 1996 to December 1998, monthly returns were obtained from Compustat and Datastream.
From these sources, we located returns for 1,060 repurchase programs.
Some of our analysis requires fundamental information, specifically the book-to-market ratio.
Compustat was our primary source for this information. However, Compustat's coverage of Canadian
firms is not complete. In addition, Canadian firms that are de-listed are not included in Compustat's
6

U.S. securities law governing stock repurchases has evolved gradually, adopting its present form in 1984 when
Congress adopted S.E.C. Rule 10b-18, a "safe-harbor" provision relating to stock repurchases. This rule does not
impose strict limits as is the case in Canada, but rather provides firms protection from legal liability for price
manipulation when repurchasing stock if firms execute repurchase trades within certain limitations relating to price,
volume and time-of-day. These provisions are not statutory rules. Companies often voluntarily repurchase shares
outside of these limits (Cook, Krigman and Leach, 1997). Moreover, Rule 10b-18 does not apply to all types of
repurchase transactions including, for example, pension-plan related (ERISA) trades. In addition, at certain times (for
example, following the crash of 1987), some of the Rule 10b-18 limitations are lifted.

research file. For these cases, we obtained book-equity values from a special file prepared for us by
Standard and Poor's. As a further step, we hand collected missing book-equity values from Moody's
International Manuals. From these sources, book-to-market ratios were obtained for 86% of our sample.
3. Methodology
a. Portfolio formation
Our examination of long-run performance focuses on portfolio returns produced in calendar-time.
Several recent papers report evidence based on this approach including Ikenberry, Lakonishok and
Vermaelen (1995), Loughran and Ritter (1995), Womack (1996) and Mitchell and Stafford (1997). To
use this approach, we calculate monthly returns in calendar-time for a portfolio of repurchase firms.
Firms are added to the portfolio at the beginning of the month following their repurchase announcement
and retained for the next three years or until the stock no longer trades. At the beginning of each month,
the portfolio is rebalanced so that each stock receives the same weight. Over time, new companies enter
the portfolio and old companies leave, causing the number of stocks in the portfolio to vary. In some
months, the number of stocks in the portfolio is small. To reduce the impact of idiosyncratic noise,
particularly when we partition our dataset into various sub-samples, months where a portfolio contains six
stocks or less are dropped from our analysis.
The portfolio described above assumes that repurchase firms are held for three years, beginning
in the month following the announcement. In addition to this strategy, we calculate portfolio returns for
other investment horizons including year 1, year 2 and year 3 following the announcement. For example,
for the year 1 portfolio, a monthly time-series of returns is calculated for firms that announced a program
in the previous 12 months. Similarly, we also report performance for year -1.
b. Benchmark models and index returns
Using the calendar-time portfolio approach, we estimate abnormal performance using two

8
benchmarks. We first evaluate performance using a standard one-factor, CAPM approach. Here, we
regress the time-series of monthly excess returns to the repurchase portfolio on excess market returns:
rp,t - rf,t = á + â m (rm,t - rf,t) + åt

(1)

where rp,t is the monthly return to a given calendar-time portfolio. The risk-free return, rf,t, is the return to
the 30-day Canadian government bill. The return to the TSE Index is our market return, rm,t . Abnormal
performance is measured by á.
The focus of our performance analysis relies on the Fama-French (1993) three-factor model:
rp,t - rf,t = á + â m (rm,t - rf,t) + â vmg (rvalue,t - rgrowth,t ) + â s m l(rsmall,t - rlarge,t) + åt

(2)

The first term in equation (2) controls for general market movements in a given month t. The last two
terms in equation (2) are value/growth and size factors. These factors are calculated using BARRA's
Canadian style returns for small-cap-value stocks, small-cap-growth stocks, large-cap-value stocks and
large-cap-growth stocks.7 For its Canadian indices, BARRA defines its large-cap universe as the largest
200 firms trading on the TSE. The next largest 300 TSE firms define the small-cap universe. These two
groups are each subdivided into growth and value portfolios. BARRA accomplishes this by calculating a
measure that gives two-thirds weight to the market-to-book ratio and one-third weight to dividend yield.
The small-cap and large-cap portfolios are sorted on this measure and split into two groups so that the
value and growth portfolios have the same total market capitalization. For the three-factor model above,
the book-to-market factor is defined as the average return for BARRA's two value portfolios (large-capvalue and small-cap-value) minus the average return to BARRA's two growth portfolios (large-capgrowth and small-cap-growth). This factor is labeled as the value minus growth portfolio, or vmg.

7

BARRA is a U.S.-based firm that provides software and information services to investment managers, pension
fund consultants, plans sponsors and others in the investment community. The style indices used in this study
were obtained from BARRA's Canadian internet site: www.barra.ca. Although not reported in this paper, we
examined the behavior of the three-factor model using BARRA style indices. Overall, the model appears to work well
in Canada.

9
Similarly, the size factor is obtained by taking the average return of BARRA's two small-cap portfolios
(small-cap, value and small-cap, growth) and subtracting the average return of BARRA's two large-cap
portfolios (large-cap-value and large-cap- growth). This factor is labeled as small minus large, or sml.
BARRA updates these style indices in January and July of each year. These series start in July of 1990.
Thus while we include repurchase programs announced during 1989 and the first half of 1990, we do not
begin measuring excess performance until July 1990. 8

4. The market reaction to open market share repurchase announcements
Panel A of Table 1 reports summary statistics for our repurchase sample. Looking at all years
together, the 1,060 programs in our sample, if fully completed, amount to $35.6 billion. The mean program
is for 5.22% of shares outstanding, similar in magnitude to the typical open market repurchase program in
the U.S. The mean market reaction to open market programs in our sample is modest. The average
abnormal return relative to the TSE index in the month the program is announced is 0.93%.9 This is
somewhat less that the market reaction observed for U.S. announcements.
Panel B reports the mean market reaction for various program sizes. A substantial number of
programs cluster right at 5% of shares outstanding. Thus, we report evidence for all programs announced
for between 4.5% and 5.5% of the share base. Those programs below 4.5% or above 5.5% are reported

8

To maximize the number of repurchase firms in our sample, we begin recording repurchase announcements in
January 1989, the first month for which copies of The Daily Record were available from the TSE archives. We begin
measuring performance in July 1990 when the BARRA style factors are available. Of course, an alternative to using
BARRA factors would be to construct our own factors, thus allowing us to measure performance for 18 more months
prior to July 1990. While possible, the portfolios would have less seasoning and, thus, be less populated and more
noisy. Moreover, for much of the 1990 to 1998 period, BARRA calculates and reports its style factors in real-time,
thus reducing concerns over potential biases.
9

As a check, we also calculated the market reaction adjusting for book-to-market and size effects. Using
Ibbotson's (1975) RATS technique, the market reaction is nearly the same as obtained using the simple marketadjusted approach, 1.05%.

10
in two separate groups. There is little apparent difference in the market reaction between large and small
programs. The mean abnormal return for programs between 0 and 4.5% of shares outstanding is 0.90%.
For the largest programs in our sample, those for more than 5.5% of shares outstanding, the mean market
reaction is slightly lower, 0.69%.
In spite of managers' frequent claims of undervaluation when announcing a repurchase program,
the announcement return is small. This is consistent with managers either being overly optimistic relative
to the market about their firm's value or, alternatively, the market being wrong and thus underreacting to
the repurchase signal. An investigation of the long-term performance of repurchasing firms is a way to
sort out the two competing hypotheses.

5. The long-term performance of Canadian open market repurchasing firms
a. The general case
In Table 2, we report performance of the repurchase strategy using both one-factor and threefactor models. Assuming a three-year holding period, we observe abnormal performance using the onefactor model of 0.62% per month (t = 2.70). Using a two-year holding period, our estimate of abnormal
performance is slightly higher, 0.70% per month (t = 2.90). Focusing on one-year holding periods,
abnormal performance is positive in each of the three years following the announcement.
After controlling for both size and book-to-market using the three-factor model, the results are
generally the same. The three-year holding period strategy shows abnormal performance of 0.59% per
month (t = 4.11) or roughly 7% per year. In this study, the similarity between the one- and three-factor
models is not unexpected given the relatively small premiums associated with the additional two factors.

11
The mean return on the vmg factor during our sample period was less than 1.5% per year while the mean
return to the sml factor was nearly zero, -0.25% per year. Given these modest premiums, alternative
approaches to adjust for size and value-growth should not substantially change the results.
A calendar-time approach weighs each month equally in the analysis even though the number of
companies in the portfolio is not the same over time. Thus, in Table 3, we report evidence using an eventtime methodology where each announcement receives the same weight. Here, we apply Ibbotson's
Returns Across Time and Securities (RATS) procedure (1975) and, as before, measure abnormal
performance using a three-factor model. Using this procedure, we continue to observe evidence of
positive abnormal returns. After three years, the total cumulative abnormal return is 21.40% (t = 6.87).
This translates to an abnormal return of 0.59% per month, a result which exactly matches that obtained
using the calendar-time approach.
To examine the robustness of our results, we performed additional tests in the context of the
calendar-time approach. We estimated abnormal performance using weighted least-squares to deal with
the problem of an uneven number of securities in the portfolio over time. We also calculated
performance using a value-weighted portfolio strategy. In both cases, the results were similar to our basic
approach.
b. Cross-sectional differences in long-run performance: value versus growth
One way to sort out the different motivations managers have for repurchasing shares is to
consider the book-to-market ratio. Managers in growth firms, with relatively low book-to-market ratios,
may repurchase shares for a variety of reasons such as avoiding dilution of earnings. For value
companies where book-to-market ratios are relatively high, undervaluation may be a more important
motivating factor.
Thus, in June of each year, we obtain book-to-market ratios (assuming a three-month reporting

12
delay following fiscal year-end for book-equity values) for all TSE-listed firms for which we have data.
This universe is sorted each year by book-to-market ratio. Those firms with above median book-tomarket ratios are called value stocks, while those with below average ratios are labeled growth stocks.
For each of these two groups, we estimate long-run performance using the calendar-time approach, the
results of which are reported in Table 4.
Value companies announcing a repurchase program substantially outperform growth companies.
Assuming a three-year holding period, the abnormal return for value stocks using the three-factor model is
0.76% per month or 9% per year. For growth stocks, the comparable return is less than half this amount,
0.28% per month. This spread between value and growth firms in Canada announcing buybacks is
consistent with the pattern observed for U.S. firms (Ikenberry, Lakonishok and Vermaelen (1995)).
Prior to the announcement, we also see evidence consistent with the undervaluation story. 10
Although, value firms perform well subsequent to a program announcement, performance in the prior year
is poor; -0.91% per month (t=-3.80). Growth firms, on the other hand, perform well in the year prior to
the announcement with abnormal performance of 0.51% per month (t=2.19).

6. Actual share repurchase activity in Canada
a) The evolution of repurchase activity over time and completion rates
Canadian law differs from the U.S. in that the progress of all authorized repurchase programs is
reported each month regardless of whether firms are buying shares or not. This information is
summarized in Table 5. Panel A reports the distribution of repurchase completion rates. The fraction of
shares actually repurchased is surprisingly low. At termination of the program, roughly a quarter of the

10

Similar evidence of negative abnormal returns prior to repurchase announcements is reported by Vermaelen
(1981) and Comment and Jarrell (1991).

13
firms did not repurchase any shares. Less than 5% of the firms fully complete their repurchase program.
Overall, the mean completion rate is 28.6%. For comparison, Stephens and Weisbach (1998) report oneyear completion rates ranging between 46% and 75% for a sample of U.S. programs announced between
1981 and 1995. 11
Panel B reports cumulative repurchase activity at various points during the program. This is
reported for the overall sample and for various sub-samples. Slightly less than half of all repurchase
activity occurs during months 0 to 3. The completion rate in Canada has increased over time. In the first
two years, it was 21.4% whereas in the last two years it increased to 35.1%. Perhaps a more interesting
result relates to the difference in completion rates between value and growth stocks. Value stocks have a
higher completion rate, 30.9%, in comparison to growth stocks, 25.1%. Extreme value stocks, defined as
companies in the top book-to-market decile, have an even higher completion rate of 37.7%. On the other
hand, extreme growth stocks have an average completion rate of only 19.6%. The difference in
completion rates between value and growth firms, both overall as well as in extreme cases, is significant
at traditional confidence levels.
b) The determinants of completion rates and strategic trading
Next, we consider in greater detail factors that influence repurchase completion rates. If
undervaluation is an important reason leading managers to repurchase stock, one would expect price
movements during the program to be an important consideration. A run-up in stock prices after a
repurchase announcement would seemingly diminish the attractiveness of buying shares. Conversely, a
drop in prices would provide an increased incentive to buy stock. Thus, the first factor we consider is the
excess stock return during the year of the program relative to the TSE index, which we label as Year 1

11

Because U.S. firms are not required to disclose repurchase activity directly, Stephens and Weisbach (1998) use
a variety of approaches to estimate completion rates for U.S. stocks.

14
Excess Return.
The next two variables considered are the firm's Book-to-Market Decile Rank and Size Decile
Rank compared to all TSE firms as of the previous June. Earlier, we observed that repurchasing firms
with high book-to-market ratios experienced higher post-announcement abnormal returns compared to
firms with lower ratios, a result consistent with undervaluation. If undervaluation is an important motive
for buybacks in value companies, we expect them to have higher completion rates compared to growth
stocks where the motives for buying stock are more complicated. We saw traces of this behavior earlier
in Table 5. The variable Size Decile Rank also relates to the undervaluation hypothesis. Evidence
suggests that smaller firms are less efficiently priced. Thus, one might expect to see higher completion
rates among smaller firms in comparison to larger, more efficiently priced firms.
Two additional control variables are included in the regressions reported in Table 6. The dummy
variable, Repeat, is assigned a value of one if the company announced a repurchase within the past 15
months. Our sample contains quite a few firms with consecutive program announcements, including
Seagrams for example. It is possible that managers in these companies are behaving opportunistically
(Ikenberry and Vermaelen (1996)) and will attempt to buy shares only if prices fall. Thus, lower
completion rates are expected from such bargain-hunter like companies. A similar rationale exists for the
second control variable, Program Size, the percentage of outstanding shares authorized for repurchase, is
similar. Some firms may authorize program amounts than are greater than they initially intend to buy,
completing the full program only if prices fall. Thus, we expect to find lower completion rates for large
authorizations.
The regression evidence reported in Table 6 is generally consistent with the undervaluation story.
The coefficient for Year 1 Excess Return is negative suggesting greater repurchase activity as prices fall.
The impact of book-to-market is positive as expected, even after controlling for other factors. Moreover,

15
given that the unconditional completion rate is 28.6%, the impact of book-to-market is material. For
example, a move from the lowest to the highest book-to-market decile changes the estimated completion
rate by 10.9% (0.0121 x 9). Similarly, size is also important; a move from the highest to lowest size decile
rank increases the expected completion rate by 6.0% (-0.0067 x -9). These results suggest that
completion rates depend on whether managers perceive their stock to be undervalued. The results also
suggest that companies with repeat announcements and those that authorized large programs end up
buying less.
To further investigate the possibility of strategic repurchase behavior by managers, we focus on
month to month repurchase activity. Such data allow us to assess the extent to which managers trade in
response to price movements before, during and subsequent to a given month. Thus, we estimate
equation (3):

Boughti,t = á + â 1 •Repeati + â 2 •Program Size i + â 3 •Size Ranki + â 4 •B/M Ranki +
â 5 •Excess Returni;t-1,t-k + â 6 •Excess Returni;t + â 7 •Excess Returni;t+1,t+k

(3)

where Boughti,t is the portion of the program firm i repurchased in month t. Our key variables of interest
are price changes in the current month t measured relative to the TSE index, Excess Returni;t , and
similarly, excess returns preceding and following month t, Excess Returni:t-1,t-k and Excess Returni:t+1,t+k ,
respectively. We consider three horizons for these leading and trailing windows: one month, three months
and six months. As in Table 6, we control for size, book-to-market, program size and repeat.12
Evidence is reported in Table 7 for all months in the program pooled together as well as for the first-half

16
and second-half of the program. Overall, managers trade strategically in response to market movements;
as prices fall, managers respond by buying more stock. This is true for price movements both in the
current month and in preceding months. In addition, these regression coefficients are highly significant.
Regression coefficients for each of the forward excess return horizons are essentially zero indicating the
difficulty in predicting future stock prices over relatively short horizons.
Managers respond differently to stock price movements in the first half versus second half of the
program. Generally speaking, response coefficients for both concurrent and past excess returns in
months 7 to 12 are double that observed in months 0 to 6. Moreover, coefficient estimates from this later
period are quite material. For example, the expected increase in the monthly completion rate for a
company with an excess market return of -50% over the previous 3 months and a concurrent excess
monthly return of -20% is roughly 1%. Given that the unconditional repurchase rate in months 7 to 12 is
roughly 1.6% per month, such a move in stock prices translates to roughly a 65% increase in the rate of
repurchase activity. One reason for this increased sensitivity is because early in the program, the
possibility to postpone repurchases to later months exists. Later in the program, this option begins to
expire. As a result, repurchase activity becomes more sensitive to price movements.
Overall, these results point to underpricing as a motivating factor for managers to repurchase
shares. If non-valuation reasons had a predominant effect on repurchase activity, one would not expect
to see such behavior. For example, if managers thought that the market efficiently priced their stock and
were using repurchases as means of returning capital to shareholders in lieu of a dividend, we would not
expect to see repurchase activity linked to market movements. However, this not the case. We see
rather substantial swings in repurchase levels associated with past and current market movements. These
results suggest that managers are indeed cognizant of market prices and execute trades accordingly.

17
7. Long-term performance conditional on program completion
In this section, we further investigate the role of undervaluation and the extent to which managers
strategically repurchase stock by examining performance using the three-factor model conditional on
completion rates. If managers are repurchasing strategically, we expect them to buy more shares as
prices decline. Similarly, we expect them to repurchases fewer shares as prices rise and mispricing
dissipates. Thus, in Table 8, we report evidence for three scenarios. First, we consider cases where
firms repurchased no shares at all after authorizing a program. The remaining programs are sorted into
two groups; those cases where managers bought less than 30% versus where they were more aggressive
and bought more than 30% of the authorized amount.
Focusing on abnormal performance in year 1, noticeable differences are observed across the
three groups. For cases where no shares were repurchased, abnormal performance is 0.96% per month
(t = 2.99) or nearly 12% per year. Yet, abnormal performance in year 1 decreases as we move to cases
where firms were active buyers. For those completing more than 30% of their program, the abnormal
monthly return is 0.22% per month (t=1.07).
Interestingly, after the programs have expired, there is no evidence of abnormal performance in
cases where no shares were repurchased. Yet, in cases where companies did repurchase shares,
substantial abnormal returns are observed in years 2 and 3 after the program is over. This pattern in
returns is consistent with evidence reported earlier and suggests that managers are sensitive to stock
prices.
In Table 9, we provide one last piece of evidence of strategic trading behavior by focusing on
trading during the last-half of the repurchase program. We partition our sample into two groups:
companies that bought shares in the last six months of the program versus companies that had no

18
repurchase activity during this period. 13 For cases where firms were active buyers late in the program,
we expect to see relatively low return performance during months 7 to 12, followed by high abnormal
returns in years 2 to 3. Conversely for those cases where no shares were bought after month 6, we
expect to see higher abnormal performance in months 7 to 12 and comparatively modest returns in years
2 to 3.
For both groups, abnormal returns during months 1 to 6 are similar; 0.47% per month in cases of
no further buying and 0.56% in cases of at least some further buying. However, abnormal performance
between the two groups diverges as expected in months 7 to 12. Firms that purchased no shares during
this period report abnormal performance of 1.14% per month(t=2.98). Yet firms which did buy shares
during this period have essentially no abnormal performance, -0.09% (t=-0.28). Moreover, if we look at
abnormal returns subsequent to the repurchase program in years 2 and 3, we see substantial excess
performance in cases where firms were buying in months 7 to 12 of 0.87% per month (t=3.89) compared
to cases where no further buying occurred, 0.26% (t=1.18).
In short, the evidence suggests that managers do appear to repurchase shares in response to
undervaluation. Moreover, managers seem to execute their trades strategically and are sensitive to price
movements.

8. A robustness check: The long-term performance Canadian equity issuances
As a final check, we examine cases where Canadian firms issued shares. A result consistent
with the repurchase evidence would show a downward drift in stock prices subsequent to an issuance of
shares. We look at firms that issued seasoned equity or issued shares to finance acquisitions. Several

13

Here, only companies which bought less than 15% of their total program by month 6 are included. This allows
us to focus on cases where the vast majority of the program remains available for repurchase during the last half of
the program. Sample sizes for the repurchase and no repurchase groups are 259 and 399, respectively.

19
studies using U.S. data report a downward drift following seasoned equity offerings, including Loughran
and Ritter (1995) and (1998) and Spiess and Affleck-Graves (1995). Following acquisitions by U.S. firms,
papers such as Agrawal, Jaffe and Mandelker (1992) and Rau and Vermaelen (1998) also report a
deterioration in performance.
Our sample was obtained from Securities Data Co. and covers the period 1989 to 1995. For both
offerings and acquisitions, we limit our sample to cases where the transaction involved at least $10 million.
Moreover, because of our focus on the issuance of equity, we remove acquisitions where stock comprised
less than one-third of the financing in the transaction. Over our sample period, there were 134 offerings
and 27 acquisitions for which we could obtain return data.14
Table 10 reports long-run abnormal performance using the three-factor model for offerings and
stock acquisitions together as well as separately. For the two events combined, abnormal performance
during the three-year post-announcement period is -0.54% per month (t = -2.60). This is similar, though
opposite in sign, to those cases where managers are repurchasing shares (0.59% per month). Prior to the
announcement, we see positive and significant abnormal performance, 1.11% per month (t = 1.98). This
compares with negative abnormal performance prior to the announcement of a stock repurchase.
Looking at equity offerings and acquisitions separately, the results are consistent with the overall sample.
For equity offerings, the results are more dramatic. Prior to the announcement, abnormal returns are
higher in comparison to acquisitions. Following the announcement, abnormal performance is
comparatively lower.
Overall, this evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that managers' decisions to expand or
contract the firm's equity base depend on the market valuation of the stock. In cases where prices

14

Securities Data reports many more acquisitions than included here. Nearly all of these deals were cash deals
or involved the acquisition of very small firms.

20
appear to be cheap, managers tend to repurchase shares. Conversely, when prices are high, managers
tend to issue shares.

9. Conclusions
Stock repurchases are an important corporate event and have been announced with increasing
frequency in recent years. In the U.S. between 1996 to 1998, companies announced nearly 4,000
repurchase programs amounting to $550 billion. This trend is apparent worldwide as many countries have
recently adopted new laws allowing firms to repurchase stock. Earlier research reports evidence of
abnormal returns following open market repurchase announcements made by U.S. firms in the 1980s,
suggesting underreaction by markets. In this paper, we provide out-of-sample evidence by focusing on
repurchases announced by Canadian firms during the 1990s.
The Canadian experience is similar to the earlier evidence obtained for U.S. buybacks. The initial
market reaction to repurchase programs is small; the abnormal return is less than 1% in the
announcement month. The market, on average, seems to underestimate the information contained in
repurchase announcements. Using a three-factor model, abnormal performance over a three-year
holding period is about 7% per year. For comparison, we also examine cases where Canadian firms
issued shares. Consistent with well-documented findings in the U.S., long-run abnormal stock returns for
these cases are negative.
Of course, undervaluation is not the only motive managers have for repurchasing stock. Other
considerations may also be at work. However, better long-run performance is expected from
repurchases that are driven more by undervaluation than by other motives. For example, one might
expect undervaluation to be a more important factor for value stocks choosing to buy back shares than for
growth stocks. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis. Companies with high book-to-market

21
ratios that announced a repurchase program tend to experience higher post-announcement abnormal
returns than low book-to-market firms.
Aside from providing out-of-sample evidence on stock returns, repurchases in Canada are
particularly interesting to study because of the legal requirement that firms report their trading activity on
a monthly basis. These unique data enable us to better understand what drives repurchases. If managers
believe that markets are efficient, we would not expect to see price changes impact trading activity.
However, the evidence suggests otherwise. Completion rates are higher in cases where undervaluation
may have been a primary motive for the repurchase, such as in value stocks and small-cap stocks, for
example. Moreover, monthly trading activity depends on price changes, suggesting that managers behave
strategically. When prices rise, managers tend to buy fewer shares whereas a drop in prices triggers an
increase in repurchase activity. This sensitivity to stock prices suggests that perceived undervaluation by
managers is an important consideration for buybacks.

Table 2
Long-run Performance of TSE-listed Firms
Announcing Open Market Stock Repurchase Programs

Portfolios are formed in calendar time for TSE-listed firms announcing an open market stock repurchase program. As time proceeds, firms are introduced to a
portfolio at various points relative to the announcement month. For example, for the portfolio labeled year 1, firms are included in the portfolio at the beginning of
the month following the announcement (month 1) and remain in the portfolio until month 12. Portfolios are also formed for year 2 (months 13 to 24), year 3
(months 25 to 36), years 1 to 2 (months 1 to 24), years 1 to 3 (months 1 to 36) and year -1 (months -12 to -1). Excess performance (in %) is measured using both a
one-factor CAPM approach and a three-factor model as suggested by Fama and French (1993):
rp,t - rf,t = á + â m (rm,t - rf,t) + åt
rp,t - rf,t = á + â m (rm,t - rf,t) + â vmg(rvalue,t - rgrowth,t) + â sml(rsmall,t - rlarge,t) + åt
where rp,t - rf,t is the excess portfolio return in month t, (rm,t - rf,t) is the monthly excess return to the TSE. In the three-factor model, (rsmall,t - rlarge,t) and (rvalue,t - rgrowth,t)
are size and book-to-market factors respectively. Both factors are derived from large-cap-value, large-cap-growth, small-cap-value and small-cap-growth style
indices defined by BARRA using 500 TSE-listed firms. The value minus growth factor is calculated by taking the difference between the average small-cap-value
and large-cap-value indices and the average small-cap-growth and large-cap-growth indices. Likewise, the small minus large factor is calculated by differencing
the average small-cap-value and small-cap-growth indices with the average large-cap-value and large-cap-growth indices. Calendar-time portfolios are
constructed beginning July 1990 and ending December 1998. Months where the portfolios contained 6 or fewer stocks are ignored. t-statistics are provided in
parentheses and test the hypothesis that the parameter value is zero, except for â m where the hypothesis test value is 1.0.

Table 3
Abnormal Performance for TSE-listed Repurchases
Estimated Using RATS
Monthly returns (in %) for sample firms are aligned in event-time, where month 0 represents the announcement
month. Abnormal performance is measured monthly using Ibbotson's (1975) Returns Across Time and Securities, or
RATS, methodology and applying the Fama-French (1993) three-factor model:
ri,t - rf,t = á t + â t(rm,t - rf,t) + â vmg,t(rvalue,t - rgrowth,t) + â sml,t(rsmall,t - rlarge,t) + åt
Here, ri,t - rf,t is the excess return to firm i in month t. For that same month, (rm,t - rf,t) is the excess return to the TSE,
(rsmall,t - rlarge,t) is the return for the size factor and (rvalue,t - rgrowth,t) is the return to the book-to-market factor,
respectively. Both factors are derived from large-cap-value, large-cap-growth, small-cap-value and small-cap-growth
indices defined by BARRA using the 500 firms included in the TSE index. The value minus growth factor is
calculated by taking the difference between the average small-cap-value and large-cap-value indices and the average
small-cap-growth and large-cap-growth indices. Likewise, the small minus large factor is calculated by differencing
the average small-cap-value and small-cap-growth indices with the average large-cap-value and large-cap-growth
indices. Using this approach, á t is our estimate of abnormal return (AR) which is estimated each month and
cumulated over time (CAR).

Table 4
Abnormal Long-run Performance
for Value versus Growth Repurchase Programs
Portfolios are formed in calendar time for TSE-listed firms that announce an open market stock repurchase program. In June of each year, value and growth cutoff values are determined by sorting TSE-listed stocks into two groups on the basis of book-to-market. Those with relatively low book-to-market ratios are
labeled Growth Stocks while the rest are labeled Value Stocks. Excess performance (in %) is measured using a three-factor model:
rp,t - rf,t = á + â m (rm,t - rf,t) + â vmg(rvalue,t - rgrowth,t) + â sml(rsmall,t - rlarge,t) + åt
where rp,t - rf,t is the excess portfolio return in month t, (rm,t - rf,t) is the monthly excess return to the TSE. In the three-factor model, (rsmall,t - rlarge,t) and (rvalue,t - rgrowth,t)
are size and book-to-market factors, respectively. Both factors are derived from large-cap-value, large-cap-growth, small-cap-value and small-cap-growth style
indices defined by BARRA using 500 TSE-listed firms. The value minus growth factor is calculated by taking the difference between the average small-cap-value
and large-cap-value indices and the small-cap-growth and large-cap-growth indices. Likewise, the small minus large factor is calculated by differencing the
average small-cap-value and small-cap-growth indices with the average large-cap-value and large-cap-growth indices. Calendar-time portfolios are constructed
beginning July 1990 and ending December 1998. Months where the portfolios contained 6 or fewer stocks are ignored. t-statistics are provided in parentheses
and test the hypothesis that the parameter value is zero, except for â m where the hypothesis test value is 1.0.

Table 5
Stock Repurchase Completion Rates in Canada
This table reports cumulative share purchase activity (in %) by month for sample firms. Normal course issuer bids are
defined to last exactly one year. Thus, months 0 and 12 are partial months. This table reports activity for all firms,
including those that departed the sample prior to one full year. Repurchase activity is reported overall, by year, by
program size, by market-capitalization and by whether the firm is ranked as value or growth. Market-cap is determined
using June cut-off values each year for all TSE-stocks. Firms below median market-cap in a given June are labeled as
Small-cap while those with above median market-cap are labeled Large-cap. Similarly, each June, all TSE-listed firms are
used to determine book-to-market cut-off values. Those repurchase firms whose book-to-market ratio is below median
are labeled Growth while those above median are labeled Value. Extreme value and Extreme growth are those firms
whose book-to-market ratio ranks them in the highest or lowest deciles respectively compared to all TSE-listed stocks in
a given June.

Table 6
Determinants of Program Completion Rates
This table reports coefficients for regressions of the program completion rate as a function of firm characteristics and stock
price performance. Year -1 Excess Return is the firm's total return during the program relative to the TSE index return. Bookto-Market Decile and Size Decile Rank are determined in the prior June. Program size is the fraction of outstanding common
stock authorized for repurchase. Repeat is a dummy variable set to one when the program the firm has announced a program
within the past 15 months.

Where Bought i,t is the fraction (ranging between 0 and 1) firm i repurchased in month t relative to the total program authorization. The first four control variables are defined the same as in
Table 6. The last three terms relate to firm i's excess total return over a given period preceding, coincident and following month t. Excess return is measured relative to the TSE 300 index
over the same period. Months where firms have completed 90% or more of the program's stated amount are deleted. Panel A reports evidence for all months 0 through 12. Panel B report
evidence using only months 0 to 6 relative to the announcement. Panel C reports evidence for months 7 through 12. t-statistics are in parentheses.

Table 8
Long-run Performance Conditional on Completion Rate
Portfolios are formed in calendar time for TSE-listed firms that announced an open market stock repurchase program. Firms are sorted into three
portfolios: those that purchased no shares, those that repurchased less than 30% of the authorized amount and those that repurchased more than 30%
of the authorized amount. Excess performance (in %) is measured using a three-factor model:
rp,t - rf,t = á + â m (rm,t - rf,t) + â vmg(rvalue,t - rgrowth,t) + â sml(rsmall,t - rlarge,t) + åt
where rp,t - rf,t is the excess portfolio return in month t, (rm,t - rf,t) is the monthly excess return to the TSE. In the three-factor model, (rsmall,t - rlarge,t) and
(rvalue,t - rgrowth,t) are size and book-to-market factors, respectively. Both factors are derived from large-cap-value, large-cap-growth, small-cap-value and
small-cap-growth style indices defined by BARRA using 500 TSE-listed firms. The value minus growth factor is calculated by taking the difference
between the average small-cap-value and large-cap-value indices and the small-cap-growth and large-cap-growth indices. Likewise, the small minus
large factor is calculated by differencing the average small-cap-value and small-cap-growth indices with the average large-cap-value and large-capgrowth indices. Calendar-time portfolios are constructed beginning July 1990 and ending December 1998. Months where the portfolios contained 6 or
fewer stocks are ignored. t-statistics are provided in parentheses and test the hypothesis that the parameter value is zero, except for â m where the
hypothesis test value is 1.0.

Long-run Performance Conditional on Trading Activity in the Second-Half of the Repurchase Program
Firms where no more than 15% of the repurchase program was completed by the end of month 6 are sorted into two portfolios. The first group contains those firms
where no shares were purchased during months 7 through 12 and are labeled "no buying". The second group contains the balance of firms which repurchased at
least some stock during months 7 to 12 and are labeled "at least some buying." Portfolios are formed in calendar time for both portfolios and excess performance (in
%) is measured using a three-factor model:
rp,t - rf,t = á + â m (rm,t - rf,t) + â vmg(rvalue,t - rgrowth,t) + â sml(rsmall,t - rlarge,t) + åt
where rp,t - rf,t is the excess portfolio return in month t, (rm,t - rf,t) is the monthly excess return to the TSE. In the three-factor model, (rsmall,t - rlarge,t) and (rvalue,t - rgrowth,t) are

Table 10
Long-run Performance of TSE-listed
Seasoned Equity Offerings and Completed Stock Acquisitions

Equal-weighted portfolios are formed in calendar time for TSE-listed firms which made either a seasoned equity offering or completed a stock (or partial stock)
acquisition of another company. For acquisitions, only cases where common stock was used to finance at least one-third of the transaction are retained. Firms where
the market value of the offering or acquisition was less than $10 million are excluded. The resulting sample includes 134 offerings and 27 acquisitions. Excess
performance (in %) is measured using a three-factor model:
rp,t - rf,t = á + â m (rm,t - rf,t) + â vmg(rvalue,t - rgrowth,t) + â sml(rsmall,t - rlarge,t) + åt
where rp,t - rf,t is the excess portfolio return in month t, (rm,t - rf,t) is the monthly excess return to the TSE. In the three-factor model, (rsmall,t - rlarge,t) and (rvalue,t - rgrowth,t) are
size and book-to-market factors, respectively. Both factors are derived from large-cap-value, large-cap-growth, small-cap-value and small-cap-growth style indices
defined by BARRA using 500 TSE-listed firms. The value minus growth factor is calculated by taking the difference between the average small-cap-value and largecap-value indices and the small-cap-growth and large-cap-growth indices. Likewise, the small minus large factor is calculated by differencing the average small-capvalue and small-cap-growth indices with the average large-cap-value and large-cap-growth indices. Calendar-time portfolios are constructed beginning July 1990 and
ending December 1998. Months where the portfolios contained 6 or fewer stocks are ignored. t-statistics are provided in parentheses and test the hypothesis that
the parameter value is zero, except for â m where the hypothesis test value is 1.0.
