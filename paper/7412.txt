The Transition to Smoking Cessation:
Evidence from Multiple Failure Duration Analysis

JEL No. I1
ABSTRACT
While much is known about the impacts prices and tobacco control policies have on smoking
participation and frequency of cigarette use, little is known about their impacts on smoking cessation.
This paper addresses the dynamics of smoking cessation using longitudinal data on young adults from
the Monitoring the Future Surveys. Site-specific prices and several measures of clean indoor air
restrictions are added to the survey data. Both parametric and semi-parametric duration models are
used to model multiple cessation attempts of young adults. The estimates indicate that increases in
the price of cigarettes increase the probability of initial smoking cessation as well as subsequent
cessation for those individuals who are unable to remain smoke-free after at least one prior cessation
attempt. The average price elasticity of cessation is 0.343. In addition, stronger restrictions on
smoking in private worksites and public places other than restaurants increase the probability of
young adult smoking cessation.

I. Introduction
Since the publication of the first Surgeon General’s report on the health
consequences of cigarette smoking in 1964, numerous studies on the determinants of
cigarette demand have been published. These studies have used diverse data, theoretical
modeling, and statistical techniques to examine the impacts prices and other policyrelated variables have on individual’s consumption of cigarettes. While a significant
number of these studies have concluded that cigarette prices and smoking participation
are inversely related, they have been unable to distinguish whether or not a decrease in
participation, due to a price increase, is a result of decreased smoking initiation or
increased smoking cessation. Economists have neglected the dynamics of smoking
transitions in their investigation of cigarette demand. Very little attention has been
devoted to investigating the determinants of smoking pathways and trajectories including:
experimentation, addiction, and cessation. Determining why individuals start smoking,
and what factors cause smoking cessation should be a central focus in formulating
appropriate anti-smoking policies. This paper addresses the dynamics of smoking
cessation and provides the first econometric analysis of the impact prices, clean indoor air
laws, and other socio-economic factors have on multiple quit attempts of young adults.
Cigarette smoking is the single most preventable cause of premature death and
disability in the United States, responsible for more than 400,000 premature deaths each
year. (CDC, 1999) According to the 1990 Surgeon General’s report, smoking cessation
represents the single most important step that smokers can take to enhance the quality and
length of their lives. In fact, many researchers consider smoking cessation the “gold

2

standard” of healthcare cost effectiveness, producing higher quality and length of life at
costs that are well below other health care interventions. (Warner, 1997)
II.

II. Previous Research
Many studies of cigarette demand have been published over the past three
decades. One general conclusion emerges from these studies – the demand for cigarettes
is responsive to changes in the price of cigarettes. According to a recent National Cancer
Institute (NCI) sponsored gathering of economists and other experts, the overall price
elasticity of cigarette smoking falls in the range of –0.3 to –0.5. (NCI, 1993)
Only three studies have examined the impact economic factors have on
individual’s decisions to quit smoking. Douglas (1998) used the 1987 National Health
Interview Survey: Cancer Risk Factor Supplement to investigate the determinants of the
decisions to start and quit smoking in the context of an economic model of addiction. He
estimated several alternative parametric duration models in his assessment of smoking
initiation and cessation. Douglas concluded that current, future, and past prices of
cigarettes have an insignificant effect on the probability of initiation. Likewise, current
and past prices were found to be statistically insignificant in the probability of quitting.
However, his estimates suggest that increases in future cigarette prices will significantly
increase quitting rates. Douglas estimates a quitting hazard elasticity of 1.07 to 1.30 with
respect to future price. This suggests that a 10% percent permanent increase in the future
price of cigarettes will reduce the average duration of smoking by 11%-13%. In addition,
the study indicated that information dissemination regarding the adverse health
consequences of smoking, bans on cigarette advertising, and state level regulations
significantly increase the probability of quitting.

While the study by Douglas (1998) made significant contributions to the
investigation of the determinants of the decision to start and quit smoking, many of his
findings, particularly those that deal with prices, are at odds with a majority of the
research on the determinants of cigarette smoking conducted over the past several
decades. One possible explanation why Douglas finds insignificant current and past price
effects may be due to the fact that he uses one year of cross-sectional data. The
application of duration methods in the econometric analysis of cigarette smoking requires
relatively high quality longitudinal data that can accurately measure cigarette
consumption, cigarette prices, government enacted policy variables, income, and sociodemographic variables over a relatively long time period. Indeed, Douglas’ study
employs cross-sectional data with retrospective information on smoking initiation and
cessation. Therefore, incorrect recall by participants can dramatically influence any
results obtained. A second possible explanation stems from the error in matching prices
to respondents’ previous states of residence. Douglas bases all previous prices that a
respondent would have paid for cigarettes on the respondent’s current state of residence.
Therefore, if a respondent lived in a different state in the past, significant errors in price
matching would be likely. As Douglas notes, the panel data requirements needed to use
duration modeling are not met in this study, and future investigation is needed using true
longitudinal data.
In a more recent study, Forster and Jones (1999) use both parametric and semiparametric techniques to investigate the determinants of smoking initiation and cessation.
As did Douglas, Forster and Jones use cross-sectional data (British Health and Lifestyle
Survey) with retrospective information on cigarette smoking to approximate the length of

4

time each individual smokes and abstains from smoking. Furthermore, in line with
Douglas’ work, they allow cigarette tax to act as a time-varying covariate.1 They find
cigarette taxes to be an insignificant determinant of smoking initiation. In addition, they
find that the estimated elasticity of the number of years smoked before quitting with
respect to tax falls in a range of -0.40 to -0.63, suggesting that a 5% increase in tax would
lead to a reduction in smoking of approximately 6 to 9.5 months. However, the authors
find strong evidence of 5 and 10 year recall bias in their quitting models. To control for
the effect of recall bias, they include dummy variables equal to one for individual’s who
recall quitting either 5 or 10 years ago and zero otherwise. The authors conclude that
recall bias had limited impact on the parameter estimates.
Finally, Tauras and Chaloupka (1999) employ data from the Monitoring the
Future Surveys (MTFS) to estimate smoking cessation equations for young adult men and
women separately. The MTFS are longitudinal data that track individual’s smoking
behaviors and other socio-economic characteristics over time for up to fourteen years.
Using a single-failure semi-parametric Cox regression model, they conclude that price
has a positive and significant impact on the probability of first-time cessation for both
young adult males and females. In addition, they find that policies restricting smoking in
private worksites increase the probability of smoking cessation among employed females.
While much has been learned over the past 30 years from economic research on
the determinants of cigarette demand, there is much more to learn. In general, cigarette
price increases appear to increase the probability of first-time smoking cessation.
However, due to the addictive nature of cigarettes and the withdrawal (disutility)

1

Although Douglas allowed price to vary at the state level over time, whereas Forster and Jones allow tax
to vary solely at the national level over time.

associated with termination of cigarette use, many smokers are unable to remain smoke
free and revert back into daily smoking. To date, no research has attempted to model the
dynamics of multiple quit decisions by smokers. This paper proposes to address this
issue by providing the first analysis of the impact prices and clean indoor air laws have
on multiple cessation attempts by individuals.

III. Data
The empirical models that are estimated in this study employ panels formed from
the nationally representative cross-sectional surveys of high school seniors conducted by
the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the University of Michigan. Each year since
1975, ISR has conducted a nationally representative random sample of between 15,000
and 19,000 high school seniors as part of a national research program titled Monitoring
the Future: A Continuing Study of American Youth (MTF)2. These surveys focus on the
use of cigarettes, alcohol, and illegal drugs and provide an accurate cross-sectional
representation of United States high school seniors.
The senior year of high school is an extremely interesting and relevant point in
time to start tracking individuals. According to the 1994 Surgeon General’s report,
nearly all first use of cigarettes occurs before high school graduation, and most adults
who regularly smoke are addicted to cigarettes by the time they are twenty years old. In
addition, the completion of high school, for many, means the end of living under parental
supervision and undergoing a transition into a different social environment.

2

In the past, the Monitoring the Future Study was sometimes called the National High School Senior
Survey.

6

One limitation that exists in the MTF data is that the surveys do not include
individuals who have dropped out of high school or who were absent the day the
questionnaires were administered. Johnston, O’Malley and Bachman (1996) have argued
that dropouts in general have substantially higher smoking prevalence rates than do inschool students. Similarly, they argue that students who are consistently absent from
school have higher prevalence rates than do regular school attendees. DeCicca, Kenkel,
and Mathios (1998) take the argument one step further and conclude that students who
drop out of high school have higher smoking prevalence rates years before they actually
drop out of high school.
Starting with the class of 1976, approximately 2,400 individuals from each senior
class are chosen to participate in follow-up surveys. The 2,400 selected respondents are
divided into 2 groups of 1,200 individuals each. One group is surveyed on evennumbered calendar years, while the other group is surveyed on odd-numbered calendar
years. As a result, one group is resurveyed for the first time one year after baseline
(senior year in high school), while the other group is resurveyed for the first time two
years after the baseline year. Subsequent follow-ups are conducted at two-year intervals
for both groups for up to seven follow-ups and then less frequently.
The questionnaires used in the follow-up surveys are very similar to those used in
the baseline. Many of the questions that were asked in the baseline are also asked in all
subsequent follow-ups so that changes in behaviors and experiences can be measured.
High school specific questions are dropped from the follow-ups and relevant post-high
school questions are added such as college education, employment status, marital status,
etc.

7

The most prominent advantage of using the MTF data is that it is the only
longitudinal data set that tracks individual’s smoking habits as they age from teenagers
through early adulthood. This is an extremely important time to analyze, because for
many, a transition from initiation/experimentation to regular smoking to cessation takes
place during this period.
A variety of cigarette consumption, socioeconomic, and demographic variables
was constructed from the survey data for all respondents. Of particular importance for
this research was the information collected on each individual’s monthly cigarette
consumption. In the baseline year and all subsequent follow-ups, all respondents were
asked the frequency with which they smoked cigarettes during the past 30 days. The
response to this question was used to construct a dichotomous smoking participation
indicator equal to one if the respondent indicated that they had used cigarettes in the
thirty days prior to the survey, and equal to zero otherwise. Tracked over time, the
participation variable maps out each individual’s smoking trajectory for up to fourteen
years or until loss due to censoring occurs.
In addition to the cigarette consumption variables, a variety of independent
variables was constructed from the surveys to control for other factors affecting cigarette
demand. These include: the age of the respondent, in years; average real yearly income
from employment (deflated by national Consumer Price Index (CPI) 1982-1984=100);
number of years of formal schooling, in years; average number of hours worked weekly;
race/ethnicity (White, Black – omitted); gender (male, female – omitted); indicators of
college student status (full-time, half-time, less than half-time, no college - omitted);
indicators of frequency of participation in religious services (never - omitted, infrequent

8

participation, moderate participation, and frequent participation); indicators of marital
status (married, engaged, separated or divorced, and single - omitted); indicators of
family structure (live alone, live with parents, live with spouse, live with child); and
indicators of type of city/town (urban - omitted, suburban, and rural).
In addition, indicators of region according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (New
England, East, South East, Midwest, South, Plains, Mountain, North West, New
York/New Jersey, and West - Omitted) and dichotomous indicators of variables capturing
the year the questionnaires were administered were constructed from the surveys to
control for region and time trends.
Based on the site identifiers, cigarette prices were added to the surveys. The price
data were obtained from Tobacco Institute’s annual Tax Burden on Tobacco. Each year,
the Tobacco Institute publishes state level cigarette prices as of November 1. These
prices are weighted averages for a pack of 20 cigarettes based on the prices of single
packs, cartons, and vending machine sales where the weights are the national proportions
of each type of sale. These prices are inclusive of state level sales taxes applied to
cigarettes, but are exclusive of local cigarette taxes. Since the price published is as of
November 1, and the survey is conducted between mid February and early June and the
dependent variables are based on past month smoking, a weighted average price for the
first six months of the year is computed. The average price for the first six months of
every year is calculated by subtracting state and federal excise taxes from the current
year’s price and the previous year’s price and weighting the pre-tax prices accordingly
(7/12 previous year and 5/12 current year). Then the average federal tax and average
state tax for the first 6 months of the year are added to the first six month’s average

9

pretax price. To account for changes in the relative price of cigarettes over time, all
cigarette prices are deflated by the national Consumer Price Index published by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (1982-1984=100).
Based on state identifiers, a set of variables reflecting the presence of state level
clean indoor air laws was added to the data. These data were obtained through special
agreement with the Centers for Disease Control from an unpublished database. The data
were used to construct three dichotomous indicators for state level restrictions on
smoking in private worksites, restaurants, and any other public place.
Finally, with the exception of gender, race/ethnicity, and parental education,
which are time-invariant across individual specific observations, all other covariates enter
the models as time-varying regressors.

IV. Methods
In the case of cigarette smoking, an individual can occupy one of two discreet
states: smoking and nonsmoking. At any point in time, each of these states is associated
with a certain level of utility for each individual. Each individual decides which state to
occupy based on the discounted present value of utility for each of the states. If the
remaining discounted lifetime utility of the smoking state exceeds the remaining
discounted lifetime utility of the nonsmoking state, then the individual chooses to become
a smoker or remain a smoker. If on the other hand, the remaining discounted lifetime
utility of the nonsmoking state exceeds the remaining discounted lifetime utility of the
smoking state, then the individual decides to abstain from smoking or quit the habit. An
individual’s utility for each state fluctuates over time in response to changes in

10

exogenous covariates including: information on the health hazards of cigarette smoking;
tobacco control policies such as clean indoor air laws, excise taxation, and youth access
laws; level of addiction; peer pressure; tastes; and various others.
Duration modeling is the appropriate statistical technique to examine the
structural determinants of the decision to make a transition from one discrete state to
another. This paper employs both parametric and semi-parametric duration models to
examine the impact economic factors have on individual’s decisions to quit cigarette
smoking. The semi-parametric model takes the form of a stratified multiple-failure Cox
regression in which the hazard at time t for a subject in group i is assumed to be:
hi(t,x(t)) = hoi(t)exp(x(t)Bi).
hoi(t) is the baseline hazard at time t, which is unknown, x(t) is a vector of time-varying
explanatory variables, and Bi is a vector of parameters, which is unknown. Group
stratification is conditional on the number of previous quit attempts. That is, each subject
is assumed not to be at risk for a subsequent event (quit attempt) until a prior event has
occurred. This is equivalent to estimating separate Cox models for each consecutive
failure under the constraint that the coefficients are the same regardless of the number of
failures, but assumes that the baseline hazard function differs across successive quit
attempts. Parameter estimates are obtained by maximizing the following partial loglikelihood function:



 
ln L = ∑  ∑ xkB − dj ln ∑ exp( xiB)  
j =1 
i ∈Rj
 
k ∈Dj
D

11

where j indexes the ordered time until cessation t(j) (j=1,…,D), Dj is the set of dj
observations that quit smoking at t(j), and finally, Rj is the set of k observations that are at
risk of cessation at time t(j).
The parametric model employed in this study takes the form of a Gompertz
regression. Unlike the semi-parametric Cox regression described above which left the
baseline hazard, ho(t), unspecified, the Gompertz model assumes that the baseline hazard
takes on a specific parametric functional form. The Gompertz parameterization yields
the following hazard, survival, and density functions:
h(t,x(t)) = exp(γt)exp(xB)
S(t,x(t)) = exp[(-exjB)/γ)(eγt –1)]
f(t,x(t)) = exp[(xjB + γt) – {1/γ (exjB+γt - exjB)}]
This distribution implies that the baseline hazard ho(t) = exp(γt), where γ is a shape
parameter that determines the shape of the distribution curve. The hazard rate increases
with time if γ>0, decreases with time if γ<0, and remains constant if γ=0. The Gompertz
distribution is therefore well suited to model the hazard of quitting, which is
monotonically increasing with time. Since the Gompertz model assumes an underlying
functional form for the baseline hazard, stratification based on previous failures cannot be
incorporated. The baseline hazard remains unchanged regardless of the number of
previous quit attempts. That is, the hazard of quitting changes over time, but is
independent of when the last cessation attempt occurred. Parameter estimates are
obtained by maximizing the following full log-likelihood function:

12

U

ln L = ∑ ln{ f (t , x (t )} +
j =1

N

∑ ln{S (t , x(t )}

j =U +1

In which f(t,x(t)) and S(t,x(t)) are the Gompertz survival and density functions
respectively, N is the number of observations, U of which are uncensored. This implies
that a subject known to fail at time t will contribute the value of the density function to
the log likelihood function, whereas a censored observation will contribute the value of
the survivor function to the log likelihood function.
According to Moffitt (1985), parametric estimates can be very sensitive to the
assumed shape of the baseline hazard. If the parametric functional form for the baseline
hazard is misspecified, inconsistent estimates of the coefficients will result. However,
when the baseline hazard is specified correctly, a parametric approach will usually
provide a small increase in efficiency (Meyer, 1990). The Cox semi-parametric model
uses variation in the covariates across observations to estimate the covariate coefficients,
while the over-time variation in the mean of the covariates is absorbed by the baseline
hazard. Parametric estimation uses the part of the variation in the mean of the
explanatory variables not accounted for by the baseline hazard component to estimate the
regressor coefficients.
To account for the correlation among the observations on an individual subject
and the correlation due to observing multiple quit attempts within the same subject, a
robust method of calculating the variance-covariance matrix proposed by Lin and Wei
(1989) is used.

V. Results

13

Estimates from the stratified Cox regressions are presented in Table 2, with the
corresponding estimates from the Gompertz regressions presented in Table 3. Each table
contains eight alternative models. The model presented in the first column of each table
(model 1) contains estimates from a specification which includes real average price, three
dichotomous clean indoor air indicators reflecting state level restrictions on smoking in
private worksites, restaurants, and any other public place, and a variety of socioeconomic variables including: race, gender, income, type of community, marital status,
family structure, parental education, mother’s work status while growing up, religious
participation, hours worked, formal years of schooling, college enrollment status, and
dummy year variables to control for year fixed effects. In addition, with the exception of
price, clean indoor air indicators, year and region indicators, and indicators of family
structure, indicators for respondents with missing data for all the above variables are
included in the models. These missing value indicators were created to prevent the loss
of a large number of observations. For example, if mother’s work status while growing
up is unknown, each of the mother’s work status variables take on a value of zero, while
an additional indicator, unknown mother’s work status takes on a value of one. This
missing value indicator takes on a value of zero for all respondents whose mother’s work
status is known.
The models estimated in the second, third, and fourth columns of each table are
identical to the first column, except the three dichotomous clean indoor air indicators are
replaced by at most one clean indoor air indicator (model 2 contains private worksite
restrictions, model 3 contains restaurant restrictions, and model 4 contains any other
clean indoor air restrictions). These models are specifically designed to minimize the

14

collinearity of included state-level variables reflecting tobacco control efforts that may be
correlated over time. The inclusion of highly correlated state-level controls may result in
misleading estimates of the correlated covariates. Models 5 through 8 are identical to
models 1 through 4, except models 5 through 8 contain nine dichotomous region
indicators to control for regional fixed effects.
The real price of cigarettes is found to have a positive and significant impact on
the quitting hazard in all the models estimated using the stratified Cox regression.
Similarly, the real price of cigarettes is found to have a positive impact on the quitting
hazard at at least the 5% significance level for all the models estimated using the
Gompertz regression, with the exception of models 5 and 6 which were significant at the
6% significant level. These estimates clearly indicate that increases in the real price of
cigarettes increase the probability of initial smoking cessation as well as subsequent
cessation for those individuals who are unable to remain smoke free after at least one
cessation attempt. Table 4 contains the estimates of the price elasticities of cessation
based on the semi-parametric and fully-parametric estimates presented in tables 2 and 3.
The estimated price elasticities derived from the Cox models are very similar to those
derived from the Gompertz models. The Cox elasticities range from 0.269 to 0.466 and
have an average elasticity of 0.350, whereas the Gompertz elasticities range from 0.245
to 0.464 and have an average elasticity of 0.336. These estimates imply that a 10%
increase in the real price of cigarettes will increase the probability of cessation among
young adults by approximately 3.4% - 3.5%.
Policies restricting smoking in private worksites are found to have a positive
impact on smoking cessation in all of the models using both Cox and Gompertz

15

techniques. However, when region fixed effects are controlled for (models 5-8), the
coefficients for private worksite restrictions are no longer significant at conventional
levels. Policies restricting smoking in public places other than restaurants are found to
have a positive and significant impact on smoking cessation in both the Cox and
Gompertz models when region fixed effect are not controlled for, but have a negative and
insignificant impact on smoking cessation when region dummies are included. In
general, restaurant restrictions have an insignificant impact on young adult smoking
cessation decisions.
Briefly reviewing the estimates for the other independent variables: Males are
significantly less likely to quit smoking than are females. With respect to race and
ethnicity, the probability of cessation is higher among Caucasians than for those of
African American descent, however, the estimates are only significant at the 5% level for
the models employing Gompertz regressions.
The results are mixed with respect to real yearly income. In the Cox regressions,
individuals with higher yearly incomes from employment are significantly more likely to
quit smoking than are individuals with lower yearly incomes. This positive relationship
implies that cigarette smoking is an economically inferior behavior, and supports much of
the recent empirical evidence on adult cigarette demand (i.e. Wasserman, et al., 1991).
However, in the Gompertz regressions, individuals with higher yearly incomes are
significantly less likely to quit smoking than are individuals with lower yearly incomes,
implying that cigarette smoking is an economically superior behavior for young adults.
This view is consistent with Chaloupka and Grossman’s (1996) and Tauras and
Chaloupka’s (1999) estimates for youth and young adult smoking behaviors. Given the

16

high correlation between age and income, the discrepancy between methodologies on
how income effects smoking cessation is likely due to how each method controls for
respondent’s age in the models. 3 That is, the Cox model uses variation in the
independent variables across observations to estimate the regressor coefficients, while the
over time variation in the mean of the covariates is absorbed by the baseline hazard. The
Gompertz regression uses the part of the variation in the mean of the independent
variables not accounted for by the baseline hazard to estimate the covariate coefficients.
Given this, the effect of age is likely to be fully controlled for in the Cox model allowing
differences in income at each age level to directly impact the probability of cessation. In
the Gompertz model however, if the baseline hazard is misspecified, inconsistent
estimates of the income coefficients may result. Therefore, it is likely that income plays
a positive role on young adult smoking cessation decisions.
No significant differences are observed between the variables capturing the
type of community individuals reside in and the probability of smoking cessation.
Individuals who are either engaged or are separated or divorced are significantly less
likely to quit smoking than are individuals who are single. Married individuals are also
less likely to quit than are individuals who are single, although the estimates are not
significant at conventional levels using the semi-parametric techniques. Young adults
who live with their parents are significantly more likely to quit smoking than are
individuals who do not live with their parents. Young adults who live with their children
are significantly less likely to quit smoking than are individuals who do not live with

3

In both methodologies, age is treated as a time variable. That is, age measures how time is recorded in the
data. Therefore, explicit control of age as a covariate is not feasible given its perfectly collinear
relationship with the time variable.

17

their children. No other significant differences are observed with respect to family
structure.
Individuals whose mothers have at least some college education are much more
likely to quit smoking as young adults than are individuals whose mother’s education did
not exceed the high school level. No significant differences are observed between
paternal education and the probability of smoking cessation. Individuals whose mothers
worked while they were growing up are less likely to quit smoking as young adults than
individuals whose mothers did not work while they were growing up, although the
relationship is not significant at conventional levels for mothers who worked full-time
employing Gompertz techniques.
Young adults with a strong attachment to religion, as measured by the frequency
of attendance at religious services, are much more likely to quit smoking than are young
adults with little or no attachment to religion. Individuals who work many hours a week
as young adults are significantly less likely to quit smoking than are individuals who
work less hours per week. Individuals who attend college full time are significantly more
likely to quit smoking than are individuals who do not attend college at all, however,
young adults with more years of formal schooling are significantly less likely to quit than
are those with less formal education. Individuals who live in the East, Midwest, New
England, New York/New Jersey, Plains, South, and South East regions of the United
States are significantly less likely to quit smoking than are individuals who live in the
West region. Finally, young adults were much more likely to quit smoking in 1977-1993
than they were in 1976.

V. Discussion
Since the release of the first Surgeon General’s report on the health consequences
of cigarette smoking in 1964, the United States government has been involved in a
sporadic and often unsynchronized campaign to reduce the use of cigarettes among the
American people. Throughout the 25 years following the onset of the government’s
campaign, significant progress was made in reducing cigarette smoking in all segments of
the population. Overall smoking prevalence declined from 40.4% in 1965 to 25.5% in
1990. (CDC, 1999) Much of this success can be attributed to tobacco control strategies,
including wide-spread dissemination of information on the health hazards of cigarette
smoking, anti-smoking advertisements, limits on cigarette manufacturers advertisements,
cigarette excise tax increases, restrictions on smoking in public places and private
worksites, and restrictions on youth access to cigarettes. (USDHHS, 1991)
However, recent data suggests that the decades of steady decline in smoking
prevalence have not been sustained. The prevalence of smoking among adults declined
very slightly in the 1990’s. According to the National Health Interview Surveys, 25.5%
of U.S. adults were current smokers in 1990 as compared to 24.7% in 1995.4 Even more
troubling however is the increased prevalence of cigarette smoking among youth and
young adults in the 1990’s. According to the Monitoring the Future Surveys (MTFS), the
prevalence of cigarette smoking among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders has increased for the
better part of a decade. (University of Michigan News and Information Services
(UMNIS), 1998) Moreover, according to the Harvard University College Alcohol Study,

4

The definition used to assess smoking prevalence changed in 1992. As of 1992, some-day smoking was
included in the definition of current smoking. The inclusion of intermittent smokers in the new definition
will increase the prevalence estimates by approximately one percentage point over the previous definition.
(CDC, 1994)

19

smoking prevalence among college students increased by 28% between the years 1993
and 1997. (Wechsler, et al., 1998) These trends, coupled with the strong addictive nature
of cigarettes, have led policymakers to increase their efforts on discouraging cigarette
use, particularly by youth and young adults. Understanding the impacts prices (which
can be increased via excise taxation) and tobacco control policies, such as clean indoor
air laws, have on young adult’s decisions to quit smoking is essential to formulating
appropriate policies aimed at reducing young adult cigarette consumption.
This paper uses both parametric and semi-parametric techniques to estimate the
impact prices and clean indoor air laws have on young adult’s decisions to quit smoking.
The estimates clearly support the hypothesis that increasing the price of cigarettes would
increase the probability of smoking cessation among young adults and therefore decrease
the amount of time they smoke. The estimated price elasticity of smoking cessation fell
in a narrow range of 0.245 to 0.466, with an average price elasticity of 0.343 for all the
models using both methods. In addition, the estimates indicate that stronger restrictions
on smoking in private worksites and public place other than restaurants generally have a
positive impact on young adult smoking cessation.
Given the estimates above, and the well-documented (USDHHS, 1990) benefits
of smoking cessation, a significant increase in cigarette excises taxes may be an
extremely effective means to reduce the death and disease caused by tobacco use in the
United States.
