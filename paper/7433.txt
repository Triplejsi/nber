Do Taxes Affect Corporate Debt Policy?
Evidence from U.S. Corporate Tax Return Data
Roger H. Gordon and Young Lee
NBER Working Paper No. 7433
December 1999
JEL No. H25, H52, G32

ABSTRACT
Past attempts to measure the impact of taxes on corporate debt policy have focused on larger firms.
Given that the top statutory corporate tax rate has varied little in recent years, tax incentives vary among
these firms, almost entirely due to current or prospective tax losses. Results are inevitably mixed, given that
firms with losses or nondebt tax shields may have different propensities to borrow even ignoring taxes.
This paper uses US Statistics of Income balance sheet data on all corporations, to compare the
debt policies of firms of different sizes. Given the progressivity in the corporate tax schedule, small firms
face very different tax rates than larger firms. Relative tax rates have also changed frequently over time.
Our results suggest that taxes have had a strong and statistically significant effect on debt levels.
In particular, the difference in corporate tax rates currently faced by the largest vs. the smallest firms (35%
vs. 15%) is forecast to induce larger firms to finance an additional 8% of their assets with debt, compared
with smaller firms.

1. Units of the variables are percents except for real assets per return and average Dow Jones index / GDP,
for which units are million US $ and a fraction, respectively.
2. Dow Jones indices are downloaded from www.forecasts.org and The Flow of Funds Accounts in the
United States are download from the Federal Reserve Board’s wet site (www.bog.frb.fed.us).
3. A small discrepancy between the means of τ st − mt and of τ t − mt occurs because the number of asset
groups varies by year.

Note: Since the dependent variable is an asset-weighted average of the debt-asset ratios, the tax incentive
a

variable, τ t − mt , is now a weighted average corporate tax rate, weighting by the size of corporate
assets in each category. The instrument is also constructed as an asset-weighted average of
τˆ st − mt .
