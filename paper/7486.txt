A large proportion of the labor force apparently would like to be their own bosses. Selfemployment presents an opportunity for the individual to set his or her own schedule, to work when
they like, to answer to nobody and possibly even as a way to become rich. Unfortunately on the
downside, if the business fails the individual may lose their job, their savings, their home if as often
happens it is used as security on a loan, and perhaps even their marriage because of the stresses and
strains. If we have learnt anything from portfolio theory it is that an individual should diversify their
portfolio and not to pool their resources into a single risky activity.
Governments on the other hand frequently see self-employment as a route out of poverty and
disadvantage and for this reason offer aid and assistance for small businesses. The justification for these
actions are usually that it is argued that self-employment will help promote invention and innovation and
thus create new jobs; new firms may also raise the degree of competition in the product market bringing
gains to consumers; greater self-employment may also go along with increased self-reliance and well
being. Unfortunately economists have little evidence on whether these hypothetical benefits exist in
practice. Even the widely held view, best expressed in Birch (1979), that small firms disproportionately
are the creators of jobs has been challenged by Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996) who have
undertaken the most careful empirical analysis of the job creation process to date1 . They argue
persuasively that “conventional wisdom about the job creating powers of small businesses rests on
statistical fallacies and misleading interpretations of the data” (1996, p.57). Indeed, they go on to
conclude the following.

1 Studies of Canadian employers by Picot, Baldwin and Dupuy (1994), of Dutch manufacturing by Huigen, Kleijweg
and van Leeuwen (1991), of Australian manufacturing establishments by Borland and Home (1994) and of German
manufacturing firms by Wagner (1995) also find that standard measurement procedures exaggerate the relative
growth performance of small firms.

2
“It is true that small businesses create jobs in disproportionate numbers. That is gross job
creation rates are substantially higher for smaller plants and firms. But because gross job
destruction rates are also substantially higher for smaller plants and firms, they destroy jobs in
disproportionate numbers. We found no strong systematic relationship between employer size
and net job growth rates….Finally, and in contrast to the lack of a clear-cut relationship
between employer size and job growth,…(we found)..clear evidence that large employers offer
greater job durability” (1996, p.170).
Despite the lack of clear and convincing evidence (I learnt that phrase from the Starr report!) of
the benefits of having a larger small business sector and/or having a higher proportion of the workforce
self-employed, as noted above, many governments around the world provide subsidies to individuals
set-up and to remain in business. In Britain and France, for example, government programs provide
transfer payments to the unemployed while they attempt to start businesses.2 In the U.S. similar
programs are being started for unemployment insurance and welfare recipients. Many countries,
including the UK and the United States, have government programs to provide loans to small
businesses, and even exempt small businesses from certain regulations and taxes. Furthermore, many
states and municipalities in the U.S. have had programs to encourage minority and female-owned small
businesses3 .
Probably the greatest interest in entrepreneurship springs from a belief that small businesses are
essential to the growth of a capitalist economy. While the view that small businesses are responsible for
a disproportionate share of job creation and innovation is disputed4, this view is a common one. It is

Zimmerman (1998). The existence of these programs that offer preferential treatment to minorities and women is the
subject of a series of challenges in the US courts. This paper is also being presented at this conference.

often argued that many of the problems of Eastern Europe come from the lack of entrepreneurs.
Academics have been interested in self-employment as a safety valve where the unemployed and victims
of discrimination could find jobs 5. Interest in self-employment has also been prompted by the belief
that they face a different set of economic incentives, and thus could be used to test various theories 6.
The simplest kind of entrepreneurship is self-employment. There is recent survey evidence to
suggest that, in the industrialized countries, many individuals who are currently employees would prefer
to be self-employed. Although it cannot be definitive, this evidence suggests that there may be
restrictions on the supply of entrepreneurs. The International Social Survey Programme7 of 1989 asked
random samples of individuals from eleven countries the question:
“Suppose you were working and could choose between different kinds of jobs.
Which of the following would you choose? I would choose ...
(i) Being an employee
(ii) Being self-employed
(iii)Can’t choose.”
As can be seen from Table 1, large numbers of people gave answer (ii) and thus stated that they would
wish to be self-employed. This answer was given by, for example, a remarkable 63% of Americans
(out of 1453 asked), 48% of Britons (out of 1297), and 49% of Germans (out of 1575). Answers are
similar when the sample is restricted to employees only. These numbers can be compared with an
actual proportion of workers that are self-employed in these countries of approximately 15%. As
pointed out by a referee, one possible interpretation of the answers to this question is that individuals

would like to be considered as self-employed by the tax authorities, thereby paying less tax. Numerous
expenses such as travel-to-work costs are tax deductible for the self-employed but not for employees.
The data raise a puzzle: why do not more of these individuals follow their apparent desire to run
a business? This paper explores the factors that may be important in determining who becomes and
remains an entrepreneur across many countries. A number of other issues are examined including a) to
what extent do the characterisitics of the self-employed vary across countries; b) the relationship
between the self-employment rate, variously defined, and the unemployment rate across countries; c)
how satisfied the self-employed are with their jobs; d) whether higher levels of self-employment increase
the real growth rate of the economy; e) how mobile the self-employed are across neighborhoods,
regions and towns. Finally I develop a flexibility index across countries based upon individuals’ reports
on how willing they are to move. According to this index the US economy was the most flexible,
followed by Canada, Germany and the Netherlands. Latvia, Russia and Hungary are found to be the
least flexible countries.
The paper uses data for a number of countries drawn from a variety of sources. The main
source of data is the Eurobarometer Surveys conducted by EUROSTAT which provides information on
member countries of the European union. These data are supplemented with cross-country data from
the International Social Survey Programme series as well as the General Social Surveys for the United
States and the Surveys of Consumer Finances in Canada. In the first section of the paper we discuss
previous research findings. Section 2 describes measurement of a self-employment rate and the
important role the agricultural sector plays in any analysis of the determinants of self-employment. It
initially models the determinants of the self-employment rate using a panel of 23 countries for the period
1966-1996 and then performs a similar analysis of the determinants of self-employment at the level of

5
the individual using a time-series of cross-sections for the period 1975-1996 for 19 countries. Section
3 examines whether the self-employed are more satisfied with their job than are individuals who are not
their own boss.

Section 4 examines whether self-employment enhances labor marker flexibility,

Section 5 contains our conclusions.
1. Previous research
After years of comparative neglect, research on the economics of entrepreneurship—especially
upon self-employment—is beginning to expand. Microeconometric work includes Fuchs (1982) Borjas
and Bronars (1989), Evans and Jovanovic (1989), Evans and Leighton (1989), Fairlie (1999), Fairlie
and Meyer (1996, 1998), Reardon (1998) for the United States, Rees and Shah (1986), Pickles and
O’Farrell (1987), Blanchflower and Oswald (1990, 1998a); Blanchflower and Freeman (1994),
Meager (1992), Taylor (1996), and Robson (1998a, 1998b) for the UK; DeWit and van Winden
(1990) for the Netherlands; Alba-Ramirez (1994) for Spain; Bernhardt (1994), Schuetz (1998), Arai
(1997), Lentz and Laband (1990) and Kuhn and Schuetz (1998) for Canada; Laferrere and McEntee
(1995) for France; Blanchflower and Meyer (1994) and Kidd (1993) for Australia and Foti and
Vivarelli (1994) for Italy. There are also several theoretical papers including Kihlstrom and Laffonte
(1979), Kanbur (1982), Croate and Tennyson (1992), and Holmes and Schmitz (1990) plus a few
papers that draw comparisons across countries i.e. Schuetze (1998) – Canada and the USA,
Blanchflower and Meyer (1994) – Australia and the USA; Alba-Ramirez (1994) for Spain and the
United States and Acs and Evans (1994) for many countries.
One possible impediment to entrepreneurship is lack of capital. In recent work using US micro
data, Evans and Leighton (1989) and Evans and Jovanovic (1989) have argued formally that
entrepreneurs face liquidity constraints. The authors use the National Longitudinal Survey of Young

6
Men for 1966-1981 and the Current Population Surveys for 1968-1987. The key test shows that, all
else remaining equal, people with greater family assets are more likely to switch to self-employment
from employment. This asset variable enters probit equations significantly and with a quadratic form.
Although Evans and his collaborators draw the conclusion that capital and liquidity constraints bind, this
claim is open to the objection that other interpretations of their correlation are feasible. One possibility,
for example, is that inherently acquisitive individuals both start their own businesses and forego leisure to
build up family assets. In this case, there would be a correlation between family assets and movement
into self-employment even if capital constraints did not exist. A second possibility is that the correlation
between family assets and the movement to self-employment arises because children tend to inherit
family firms.
Blanchflower and Oswald (1998a) find that the probability of self-employment depends
positively upon whether the individual ever received an inheritance or gift. This emerges from British
data, the National Child Development Study; a birth cohort of children born in March 1958 who have
been followed for the whole of their lives. Second, when directly questioned in interview surveys,
potential entrepreneurs say that raising capital is their principal problem. Third, the self-employed report
higher levels of job and life satisfaction than employees. Fourth, psychological test scores play only a
small role. Work by Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian and Rosen (1994a, 1994b) drew similar conclusions using
different methods on US data. The work of Black et al (1996) for the UK discovers an apparently
powerful role for house prices (through its impact on equity withdrawal) in affecting the supply of small
new firms. Cowling and Mitchell (1997) find a similar result. Again this is suggestive of capital
constraints.

Finally, Lindh and Ohlsson (1994) adopts the Blanchflower-Oswald procedure and

provide complementary evidence for Sweden. Bernhardt (1994) in a study for Canada using data from

7
the 1981 Social Change in Canada Project also found evidence that capital constraints appear to bind.
Using the 1991 French Household Survey of Financial Assets, Laferrere and McEntee (1995)
examined the determinants of self-employment using data on intergenerational transfers of wealth,
education, informal human capital and a range of demographic variables. They also find evidence of the
importance played by the family in the decision to enter self-employment. Intergenerational transfers of
wealth, familial transfers of human capital and the structure of the family were found to be determining
factors in the decision to move from wage work into entrepreneurship.
There has been relatively little work on how institutional factors influence self-employment.
Such work that has been conducted includes examining the role of minimum wage legislation (Blau,
1987), immigration policy (Borjas and Bronars, 1989) and retirement policies (Quinn, 1980). Studies
by Long (1982) and Blau (1987) and more recently by Schuetze (1998) have considered the role of
taxes. In an interesting study pooling individual level data for the US and Canada from the Current
Population Study and the Survey of Consumer Finances respectively Schuetze (1998) finds that
increase in income taxes have large and positive effects on the male self-employment rate. He found
that a 30 percent increase in taxes generated a rise of 0.9 to 2 percentage points rise in the male selfemployment rate in Canada compared with a rise of 0.8 to 1.4 percentage point rise in the US over
1994 levels.
A number of other studies have also considered the cyclical aspects of self-employment and in
particular how movements of self-employment are correlated with movements in unemployment.
Meager (1992) provides a useful summary of much of this work. Evans and Leighton found that white
men who are unemployed are nearly twice as likely as wage workers to enter self-employment.
Bogenhold and Staber (1991) also find evidence that unemployment and self-employment are positively

8
correlated. In Blanchflower and Oswald (1990) we found a strong negative relationship between
regional unemployment and self-employment for the period 1983-1989 in the UK using a pooled crosssection time-series data set8 . In Blanchflower and Oswald (1998a) we confirmed this result, finding that
the log of the county unemployment rate entered negatively in a cross-section self-employment probits
for young people age 23 in 1981 and for the same people aged 33 in 1991. Taylor (1996) confirmed
this result using data from the British Household Panel Study of 1991, showing that the probability of
being self-employed rises when expected self-employment earnings increase relative to employee
earnings, i.e. when unemployment is low. Acs and Evans (1994) found evidence from an analysis of a
panel of countries that the unemployment rate entered negatively in a fixed effect and random effects
formulation. However, Schuetze (1998) found that, for the US and Canada that the elasticity of the
male self-employment rate with respect to the unemployment rate was considerably smaller than he
found for the effect from taxes discussed above. The elasticity of self-employment associated with the
unemployment rate is about 0.1 in both countries using 1994 figures. A decrease of 5 percentage
points in the unemployment rate in the US (about the same decline occurred from 1983-1989) leads to
about a 1 percentage point decrease in self-employment. It does seem then that there is some
disagreement in the literature on whether high unemployment acts to discourage self-employment
because of the lack of available opportunities or encourage it because of the lack of viable alternatives.
There is, however, a good deal of agreement in the literature on the micro-economic correlates

over the years 1983-1989 were as follows (Source: OECD Economic Outlook).

of self-employment (see Aronson, 1991) on this. It should be pointed out that most of this work is
based on US data and, as we shall see below, the results do not necessarily carry through elsewhere.
Subject to that caveat it appears that self-employment rises with age, is higher amongst men than
women and higher among whites than blacks. Increases in educational attainment are generally found to
lead to increases in the probability of being self-employed. The more children in the family the higher
likelihood of (male) self-employment. Workers in agriculture and construction are also especially likely
to be self-employed.
2. The determinants of self-employment
The self-employed are a very disparate group. They are likely to include farmers, craftsmen,
shopkeepers, lawyers, doctors, architects, entertainers, sportsmen and women, computer programmers
and analysts amongst others. Unfortunately most of the data files we have access to do not report the
occupation of the self-employed person – self-employment is the reported occupation. It would be a
good idea, as suggested by a referee, to analyze self-employment for a distinct occupational group such
as cleaning and catering, but unfortunately this is not possible with the data we have available to us.
It turns out it is also not a simple matter to determine whether an individual is actually selfemployed or not. It is certainly not a simple task to do so in a consistent way across countries. Some
of the individuals who report being self-employed are unpaid family workers. This is considerably
more prevalent in the agricultural sector than it is in non-agriculture – the unweighted average over the
sixteen countries for which I have data in 1996 is 19.6% in agriculture and 7.3% in the non-agricultural
sector and 11.6% overall. There is also considerable variation by country – overall 33.6% of the selfemployed in Japan are unpaid family workers compared with 1.7% in the USA; 12.9% in Germany;

10
14.0% in Italy and 3.7% in Canada9 . The extent to which individuals report being unpaid family
workers is likely to be a function of both the tax regime and the welfare system prevailing within a
country. It does not seem to be appropriate to simply throw away these individuals from any analysis;
not least because there are other ways of remunerating the self-employed than via a wage. An example
would be that an individual’s expenses can be charged to the business and/or the value of the business
may increase over time even though no salary is being paid. In my experience this is more of a problem
in Europe than it is in North America. Earnings data for the self-employed seem to convey some
information in the US. In the UK, for example, earnings of the self-employed are low and frequently
zero or negative.
There is a further issue which needs to be confronted – how to deal with the owners of larger
businesses – know in the USA as the incorporated self-employed. In the USA they are usually treated
as employees (see Bregger, 1996). In Europe, and as far as I am aware in most of the rest of the
OECD, they are included in the self-employment count. In a paper like this it is difficult to reconcile
these differences. The approach we take in this paper to overcome these definitional problems is as
follows.
1. Analyze a series of micro-data files that have been collected across several countries with similar
sample design, definitions and questions.
2. Pool data across countries and through time and include a group of country and year fixed effects in
an attempt to control for the nuances of the economic and legislative environment within which the
self-employed operate.

9

The proportion of the self-employed that are unpaid family workers in the remaining countries in 1996 was
Australia 6.1%; Denmark 10.6%; Finland 4.6%; Iceland 2.3%; Ireland 5.1%; Netherlands 9.6%; Norway 10.3%;

11
3. Work with the official data published by the OECD who have made considerable efforts over the
years to make these estimates as comparable as possible across countries (see Annex 4A, OECD,
1992).
There is also considerable disagreement on how the self-employment rate should be measured.
As we show below differences in results across papers are on occasions to be explained by differences
in what is included in the denominator of the self-employment rate as well as on the sample restriction
rules used. The problem is twofold. First, there is a good deal of disagreement in the literature whether
the self-employed to be examined should include individuals working in both agriculture and nonagriculture. Second, there are three main ways of measuring the denominator
a) employees,
b) the labor force (employees plus unemployed),
c) the population and sometimes restricted to include the population ages 16 - 65.
In this section we consider what if any differences arise in modeling self-employment as a result
of such differences in definition and sample selection.. Table 2 reports data on the change in the
proportion of all workers who were self-employed for the years 1966, 1976, 1986 and 1996 in our
sample of 23 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UK, USA). Data are taken from various issues of the OECD Economic
Outlook. In 1996 the highest proportions were found in Turkey (58%) and Greece (46%) and the
lowest in Luxembourg (7.5%) and the USA. (8.4%). If we compare the two end years we observe that
over the last 30 years this rate fell in all countries except Iceland, New Zealand, Portugal and the UK.
______________________
Portugal 5.8%; Spain 14.3%; Sweden 3.4%.

12
Table 3, which presents the proportion of non-agricultural work that is accounted for by the
self-employed also shows considerable diversity in experience across countries. However, now there
are several additional countries where there has been an upward trend between 1966 and 1996
(Australia, Canada, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden, New Zealand and the United
Kingdom) than was found in Table 2, which included both the agriculture and non-agricultural sectors.
Clearly there are broad similarities with the trends in self-employment identified in the two tables.
Overall, the predominant trend in self-employment is downward; the main exceptions are New Zealand,
Portugal and the UK where there have been substantial increases in the self-employment rate, however
measured.
The next issue we examine is what are the determinants of self-employment and to what extent
do they vary across countries? We do so in Table 4 by estimating five self-employment equations using
different definitions of the dependent variable. Total observations are 626 for the years 1966-1996;
using a lagged dependent variable reduces the sample size to 600. The data set is an unbalanced panel.
As we move across the columns the definition of self-employment is varied10 . Included in each of the
regressions is a lagged dependent variable, a time trend (1966=zero), the percentage of total
employment in agriculture, 21 country dummies, the natural logarithm of the unemployment rate and a
full set of interactions between the country dummies and the log of the unemployment rate. The main
conclusions are as follows

10 Definitions of the dependent variables in Table 7 are as follows -- column 1=self employment/total emplo yment;
column 2=self employment/labor force; column 3= self employment/ population aged 16-64; column 4=(selfemployed/all workers) –in the non-agricultural sector; column 5 =(self-employed/all workers) in the agricultural sector.

13
1) In the first four equations the trend in self-employment is positive and significant. It is negative in the
final column for the agricultural sector.
2)

As might be expected, the higher the percentage of workers in agriculture, the higher the various
self-employment rates. The variable is insignificant in the agricultural sample in the last column of the
table.

3) The unemployment rate enters significantly with a negative coefficient when entered on its own
without any interaction terms when the dependent variable is defined only as in column 3 (results not
reported) but is insignificant in the other specifications of the dependent variable used in Table 4
(results also not reported). The significance of the various interaction terms suggests there is
considerable variation across countries in the influence of unemployment, both in terms of the
direction and magnitude of any effect. If we look at the first column where self-employment is
expressed as a proportion of total employment, the unemployment rate enters negatively in Austria,
which is the excluded category

11 .

There is an even larger negative effect in Japan. Most of the

other coefficients are positive, although in a number of cases the t-statistic is low suggesting that the
effect of the unemployment rate is not significantly different from that of Austria (i.e. Denmark,
Luxembourg, Portugal, Canada, France, Netherlands, Germany, USA). Even though most of the
other interaction terms have significant t-statistics, implying that the effect of unemployment in that
country is significantly higher than it is in Austria, only in Iceland and Italy (t=2.3 and 6.0
respectively) does the unemployment effect turn positive. There is evidence of even stronger
negative unemployment effects when the sample is restricted to agriculture in the final column. Some

11 T h e t-statistics re ported on the unemployment and country interaction terms test whether the coefficient is
significantly different from the excluded category Austria whose coefficient is that on the unemployment rate (-.0190).

14
experiments were done with lags on the unemployment rate in all five columns and the results were
similar.
Any labor economist worth his salt is not going to limit him or herself to time-series data, so in
the time honored fashion I move on to modeling self-employment using micro data. I make use of a
data file I have constructed at the level of the individual for 19 countries12 and just under 575,000
people. Data are taken from various Eurobarometer Surveys conducted by the European Commission
for the years 1975-1996 which was merged with a set of data drawn from the United States from the
General Social Surveys. The Eurobarometer Surveys cover member countries in all years as well as
potential members even before they join – hence information is available on Norway for a few years
even though the Norwegians actually voted not to join the EU. A considerable amount of preliminary
data work had to be conducted to put these 45 separate surveys on a comparable basis. The numbers
of observations by country and the years for which data are available are as follows

We now look at a series of probit equations in Table 5 that model the probability that an
individual is self-employed in their main job. The numbers of controls are limited because of the need
for comparability over time and countries – they include age, education, gender, household size and the
number of children under the age of 15 in the household. I have also mapped onto the data file the
gender-specific country unemployment rate for each year. I am unable to distinguish agricultural and
non-agricultural employment in my data files currently. As we move across the columns the definition of
the dependent variable is changed from a 1 if self-employed and a zero if an employee in column 1.
Column 2 a zero also includes the unemployed and in column 3 those out of the labor force are added
with the sample restricted to those individuals between the ages of 16 and 65. Eighteen country
dummies and the log of the unemployment rate plus a full set of interactions between the country
dummies and the unemployment rate also included. Robust standard errors are estimated with an
adjustment to allow for the so-called Moulton problem (Moulton, 1986, 1987, 1990) because
unemployment rates relate to groups that have common components in their residuals; without such an
adjustment standard errors would be biased downwards. For a discussion of this procedure see p.238
of Stata Release 5 User’s Guide (1997) and Rogers (1993).
The probability of being self-employed rises with age, is higher for men than women and is
higher the larger is household size. Interestingly the least educated (age left school < age 15) and the
most educated (age left school >=22 years) have the highest probabilities of being self-employed. The

16
time trend in all cases has a significant U-shape minimizing towards the end of the 1980s. When entered
on its own without the country interactions the log of the unemployment rate is significantly positive in the
first two columns and zero in the third (results not reported). The inclusion of the interaction terms in all
three cases significantly improves the overall fit. Hence specifications with interactions are the ones
reported. The coefficient on the unemployment rate refers to the US, which is not significantly different
from zero in all three specifications. In column 1 significant negative effects are found in Austria,
Denmark and Finland (based on a t-test of whether the overall effect for the country is significantly
different from zero). On the other hand significant positive effects are found in Belgium, the United
Kingdom, Germany, Norway and Sweden. No evidence of any effect from unemployment was found
in France, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Greece, Spain and Portugal, These results are little changed as
the measurement of the dependent variable, and hence the size of sample, is altered as we move across
the columns.
In order to get a clearer picture of how the determinants of self-employment vary across
countries I estimated a series of equations for each country. I also report results for Canada using a time
series of cross sections of the Surveys of Consumer Finances for the years 1984-1995 (for details see
the Data Appendix). Results are reported in Table 6. I exclude the unemployment rates as there are
only two unemployment observations per year—one each for males and females. I group Austria,
Finland, Norway and Sweden together as there are only two years of data available for each of these
countries and include three country dummies. Analogously I combined East and West Germany and
Great Britain and Northern Ireland. To examine the role of education two dummy variables, which
distinguish the highest and lowest education categories, were also included. With only a couple of
exceptions both the age and male variables are significantly positive. The results for the time trend,

17
household size and the number of children are much more mixed across countries. Interestingly the
findings in Table 8a are broadly confirmed; self-employment is highest for individuals at the tails of the
education distribution. Individuals with the least education have the highest probability of being selfemployed which is consistent with the recent findings of Reardon (1998) for the USA. The main
exception is the UK where the reverse is the case.
To conclude this section it appears that there is little consistent evidence that self-employment is
correlated with unemployment consistently across countries. On balance there is probably more
evidence in support of a negative effect but there is evidence of positive effects in a number of countries.
Second, there is also a good deal of variation in the determinants of self-employment. Common to most
countries is the fact that self-employment is dominantly male and more prevalent among older age
groups than it is among the young (see Blanchflower and Oswald, 1998c for more on this). There is
some evidence that self-employment is more prevalent among groups at the two ends of the education
distribution and especially so for the least educated.
3. Job satisfaction
In this section I examine how satisfied the self-employed are with their jobs in comparison with
employees. Questions about job satisfaction are difficult to interpret due to the subjective nature of the
variable and the problem of making interpersonal comparisons (Freeman, 1978). Still, the econometric
literature based upon satisfaction data has yielded interesting and consistent results across data sets that
show links between satisfaction and economic and demographic variables. The small economics
literature on this issue includes Hamermesh (1977), Borjas (1979), Freeman (1978), Meng (1990),
Clark and Oswald (1992, 1996), Clark (1996), Blanchflower and Freeman (1996) and Blanchflower
and Oswald (1999). Comparisons of responses to satisfaction questions across countries are fraught

18
with even greater dangers, and we are aware of only one study making satisfaction comparisons across
countries (Blanchflower and Freeman (1994) who compare job satisfaction in 10 countries). People in
one country may “scale” responses differently than those in another. For instance, Americans may be
relatively optimistic, with an “everything will work out” mentality that leads people with the same true
satisfaction (on some objective scale) to respond more positively to a “Are you satisfied with your
job?” question than the potentially more reserved British. Subject to these caveats it is not without
interest to compare the satisfaction of the self-employed with that of employees.
In two earlier jointly authored papers paper I found that the self-employed reported being more
satisfied with their jobs than was the case for employees. In Blanchflower and Oswald (1998a) we
examined data for the UK from the National Child Development Study of 1981 for a sample of 23-year
and found that the self-employed were more satisfied with their jobs13 . Approximately 46% of the selfemployed said that they were in the top category of ‘very satisfied’, whereas the figure was 29% for
employees. Ordered probit equations which also included controls for union membership, marital
status, gender, disabled status, region, highest educational qualification, part-time, ever unemployed in
the previous 5 years, a dummy for problems with arithmetic, months of experience, and job tenure
confirmed this result. As an experiment into the effects of access to capital, we split the data into two
sub-samples – those who had received no inheritance (the capital constrained) and those people who
had received an kind of inheritance or gift – that we suggested might be considered to be less capital
constrained. There is some evidence that the self-employment dummy variable had a smaller impact in

13 The question asked was "Taking everything into consideration, how sa tisfied or dissatisfied
are you with your job as a whole" (Q19j, p.9: NCDS4 questionnaire). The responses were coded
into five categories -- very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neither, satisfied, and very satisfied.

19
the group who inherited; the dummy even goes negative. Such evidence, we argued, might be taken to
be consistent with the idea that those with capital—through an inheritance—are more able to enter the
self-employment sector and drive down the rents available there.
In Blanchflower and Freeman (1997) a series of job satisfaction equations across 11 countries
were estimated using data from the International Social Survey Programme of 1989 (for details see the
Data Appendix) and found that the self-employed had higher levels of job satisfaction than employees in
an equation where the countries were pooled14 . Job satisfaction was especially low in Hungary. Table
7 reports levels of job satisfaction using these same data for the self-employed and employees and
confirms the finding that the self-employed report higher levels of satisfaction than do employees in
every country except Hungary. Table 8 reports the results of estimating an ordered logit with a full set
of country dummies (Blanchflower and Freeman (1997) only included a Hungary dummy). The higher
level of job satisfaction of the self-employed is confirmed. When separate equations by country were
estimated (results not reported) the coefficient on self-employment is significantly positive in all countries
except Ireland and Hungary where it is insignificantly different from zero.
New data on job satisfaction has recently become available for the 15 member countries of the
European Union from one of the special supplements to the Eurobarometer Survey #44.2 (available
through ICPSR as survey #6722) that was collected between November 1995 and 1996. The survey
included a series of questions on working conditions that included a question on job satisfaction15 . The

14

The question asked was "How satisfied are you in your main job?” (Q21 ISSP 1989 questionnaire). The
responses were coded into seven categories -- completely dissatisfied, very dissatisfied, fairly dissatisfied, neither,
fairly satisfied, very satisfied and completely satisfied.
15 The question asked was "on the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, very satisfied or not at all satisfied
with your main paid job? (Q36). These data were also examined by Blanchflower and Oswald (1999).

20
weighted responses by country are tabulated in Table 9 separately for employees and the selfemployed. Despite the rather small sample sizes for the self-employed once again it appears to be true
that the self-employed have higher levels of job satisfaction than those who are not their own boss. The
only exception to this is Greece. The survey is rich in information on other aspects of the job which can
be included in a job satisfaction in an attempt to distinguish the source of this higher level of satisfaction.
In Table 10 ordered logit equations are estimated with job satisfaction as the dependent variable (1=not
at all satisfied, 2=not very satisfied and so on) which include controls for industry, occupation, age and
its square and gender in column 1 and confirm the finding that the self-employed have significantly higher
levels of satisfaction than employees (t=7.8). In column 2 further controls for commuting time, job
tenure, shift working, establishment size, and public sector are added and find the same self-employment
result (t=4.6). Reading from column 2, job satisfaction is U-shaped in age; lower for those who work
shifts, who work alone or are employed in agriculture or live in Greece. Job satisfaction is higher for
legislators/managers; for those in public sector jobs, with longer job tenure, with shorter commuting time
to their place of work and who live in Denmark. When column 1 is re-estimated separately for each
country, the coefficient on the self-employment dummy is positive in every case. It has a t-statistic
above 2 for 6 countries (Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Sweden), between
1.8 and 2 for a further three countries (Ireland, Great Britain and Finland) and 1.5 for Denmark. It is
insignificantly different from zero in Greece, Spain, France, Portugal and Austria.
Data on job satisfaction is also available for the United States in the General Social Surveys for
the years 1972-199816 and are shown below for the employed and self-employed.

Job satisfaction levels for the self-employed are considerably higher than for employees. This result is
confirmed in column 1 Table 11 with the sample pooled over 21 years of data (this is not a panel of
individuals but a rolling cross-section and which includes age and its square, gender, race, hours of
work, years of schooling plus a time trend in addition to a dummy for self-employment. The selfemployed report being more satisfied with their work than employees using this long time run of data for
the United States. Indeed, this result is robust to the inclusion of per capita household in column 2
which leaves the size and significance of the self-employment variable essentially unchanged.
I conclude this section with a simple statement. The self-employed are more satisfied with their
jobs than are individuals who work for somebody else.
4. Labor Market Flexibility and Macro-economic Performance
Over the last couple of decades many countries – and especially the United Kingdom and New
Zealand – implemented reforms focused directly on the labor market. Such reforms were expected to
improve the workings of the economy by changing the labor market: industrial relations laws that
weakened union power; measures to enhance self-employment; privatization of government-run or
owned businesses; reduction in the value of unemployment benefits and other social receipts relative to
wages; new training initiatives; tax breaks to increase use of private pensions; lower marginal taxes on
individuals; elimination of wage councils that set minimum wages. In the price-theorists’ ideal world,
these changes were intended to reduce market rigidities, increase mobility, and raise incentives. They
were intended to create the micro-institutional base for a more effective market economy with higher

22
productivity, lower unemployment, improved living standards, and possibly a higher permanent rate of
economic growth as well. Unfortunately there is relatively little empirical evidence available to support
these contentions and especially so in the case of entrepreneurship and self-employment17 . Indeed,
relatively little is known about the macro-economic correlates of self-employment.
Table 12 examines the relationship between the growth in real GDP, and changes in the selfemployment rate, using time series data on 23 countries for the period 1966-1996 (the countries are:
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Eire, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy,
Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UK and
the USA). The regressions should be thought of as a Cobb-Douglas production function, where the
change in the numbers of employees over the previous period is included to distinguish the labor input.
Capital is assumed to grow linearly and as the model is estimated in changes the effect of capital will be
in the constant. Also included in the regressions are a set of country dummies plus a lagged dependent
variable. The three columns experiment with different measures of the change in self-employment over
the preceding period where the number of self-employed is expressed as a percentage of all workers in
column 1; of the labor force in column 2 and the population age 16-64 in column 3. Increases in the
proportion of self-employment appear to produce lower not higher GDP; this result is significant in
columns 1 and 2 but not in 3. These results presume a particular direction of causation – from selfemployment to growth and not the reverse, which is clearly a possibility—and are meant to be
illustrative. Clearly more work is warranted on this question, but it certainly does not appear that more is
better in this instance, contrary to the assertions of some.

17 For a discussion of the relative lack of success of the Thatcher labor market reforms in transforming the UK
economy see Blanchflower and Freeman (1994).

23
There seems to be a widely held belief that the self-employed are inherently more flexible and
adaptable than are employees. Clearly their earnings tend to be more cyclically volatile than that of
employees: small firms are continuously dying as others are being born. There is another aspect of
flexibility that does not seem to have been considered – are the self-employed more or less mobile
geographically than are employees? A recent sweep of the International Social Survey Programme
(ISSP) conducted in 1995 asked respondents in 23 countries the following questions
“if you could improve your work or living conditions, how willing or unwilling would you be to
•
•
•
•

move to another neighbourhood (or village); Q2a
move to another town or city within this (county): Q2b
move to another region: Q2c
move outside your country? Q2d

Possible responses were “very willing, fairly willing, neither willing nor unwilling, fairly willing
and very unwilling”
Table 13 reports four ordered logit equations relating to each of these questions.

The

dependent variable is set to 1 if very unwilling and so on, hence a positive coefficient can be interpreted
as indicating that the individual is more willing to move. The sample is restricted to 13 OECD countries
(Austria, Canada, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the UK
and the USA). Information is also available on 7 ex-Communist countries (Hungary, Czech Republic,
Slovenia, Bulgaria, Russia, Latvia and Slovakia) plus the Philippines but these countries were dropped.
There is some evidence that males are more willing to move regions and country than are females – but
there is no difference between the sexes by town or neighborhood. Being prepared to move is
negatively correlated with age and years spent living in the current location and positively correlated with
education, whether or not an individual had lived abroad and for how long. The unemployed seem to
be more mobile than the other labor market groups. The self-employed appear to be less prepared to

24
move neighborhood, town or region than are employees. This presumably arises because of the
presence of a customer base for the self-employed along with business and personal contacts.
One possible interpretation of the coefficients on the country dummies reported in Table 13
would be as a flexibility index. This seemed an intriguing possibility, so in Part A of Table 14 I simply
ranked the countries by the coefficient on the country dummy from the separate regressions in Table 13,
for the sub-sample of OECD countries. Columns 1-3 relate to responses to questions on whether the
individual was willing to move neighborhood, town or region respectively. The next to last column is the
sum of the ranks in the first three columns and the next column is a rank ordering derived from these
sums. I exclude from these calculations the information on whether an individual is prepared to move to
another country as this is not strictly relevant to the task in hand. Americans are the most willing to
move within their country followed closely by the Dutch, whose labor market has performed remarkably
well over the last decade or so18 . The Irish are the least mobile followed closely by the Italians and the
Japanese. The last column is the proportion of the total population that is self-employed in 1996. The
results here are intended to simply be suggestive but it should be noted that countries with a low
proportion of self-employment appear to the most flexible, confirming our earlier results.
In an attempt to validate these results I re-estimated the equations in Table 13 but now with the
full sample of countries which includes seven ex-communist countries and the Philippines (sample size
now just under 24,000). The results are reported in Part B of Table 14. The results are slightly
different from those reported in Part A for the OECD countries; the main difference is that now the US

18

The Dutch economy has had strong growth in employment over the last decade or so and unemployment
perfomance has also been strong. It’s (standardized) unemployment rate in 1996 was well below that of other
European countries at 6.3% (Source: OECD Economic Outlook, June 1998). This compares with 9.7% in Belgium,
6.9% in Denmark, 15.3% in Finland, 11.6% in Ireland, 8.2% in the UK, 8.9% in Germany, 12.4% in France and 12.0% in
Italy.

25
is ranked first, as the most flexible country, on all three measures, and Canada, Germany and the
Netherlands all rank equal second. Latvia and Russia are the least flexible followed by Hungary. The
highest ranked ex-Communist country is Slovakia which ranks eleventh. Our only developing country,
the Philippines, is in the middle of the pack ranking fourteenth. One of the considerable advantages of
this measure of flexibility is that it seems to match closely most people’s priors. It certainly matches
them more closely than my earlier attempts to generate a wage flexibility index across countries by
comparing how individual’s wages are influenced by local area unemployment rates19 .
5. Conclusions
The main conclusions are as follows.
1. The overall trend in self-employment, at the economy level in the years since 1966, has been down
in most countries. The main exceptions to this are Portugal, New Zealand and the United Kingdom
where the trend has been upward.
2. As a proportion of non-agricultural employment self-employment has declined in some countries
(Austria, Belgium, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Spain and the USA) but increased in
others (Australia, Canada, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Portugal, Sweden and the
United Kingdom).
3. For most countries there is a negative relationship between the self-employment rate (variously
defined) and the unemployment rate. From the time series regressions evidence of positive effects is
found only in Iceland and Italy. The effects are more strongly negative in the agricultural sector.
There is more evidence of positive unemployment effects in the individual level equations.
4. The probability of being self-employed is higher among men than women and rises with age. The
least educated have the highest probability of being self-employed, however, evidence is found that
the most highly educated have relatively high probabilities.
5. The self-employed have higher levels of job satisfaction than employees.

______________________
19 There is now a large literature that estimates wage curves across countries. Interestingly most of the estimates of
the so-called unemployment elasticity of pay which crowd closely around –0.1. That is a doubling of unemployment
lowers wages by 10% almost everywhere. For a discussion see Blanchflower and Oswald (1994, 1996).

26
6. I could find no evidence that increases in the self-employment rate increased the real growth rate of
the economy.
7. The self-employed are less willing to move from their neighborhoods, towns and regions than are
employees, presumably because of the pull of their customers.
8. I developed a flexibility index based on information provided by individuals in 1995. According to
this index the US economy was the most flexible, followed by Canada, Germany and the
Netherlands. Latvia, Russia and Hungary were found to be the least flexible countries. Of the
OECD countries examined, Austria and Ireland were ranked lowest.
