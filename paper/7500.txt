The Role of Alcohol and Drug Consumption in Determining Physical
Fights and Weapon Carrying by Teenagers

ABSTRACT

The purpose of this study is to examine the question of whether alcohol or drug use causes
teenagers to engage in violent behaviors as measured by physical fighting, carrying a gun, or carrying
other types of weapons. Simple OLS estimation of the effects of drug and alcohol consumption on
violence may be biased because of the possibility that both behaviors are determined by unmeasured
individual traits. Two-stage least squares estimates are employed to establish causality. This method
first predicts consumption using the prices of beer, marijuana and cocaine and then enters predicted
consumption in the violence equation. This technique allows the consumption measures to be
purged of their correlation with unobserved characteristics. Data come from the National SchoolBased Youth Risk Behavior Surveys, which are nationally representative samples of high school
students. Results indicate that beer and marijuana consumption do cause teens to engage in more
physical fights, while cocaine use appears to have no relationship. None of the substances lead to
increased probabilities of carrying a gun or other weapon.

INTRODUCTION
The issue of teenage violence has been thrust into the national spotlight by a recent string
of shootings in our nation’s high schools, although during the past few decades, teenage violence
has become an increasingly growing problem. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (1994 and 1999a)
reports that violent victimization rates against youths who are between the ages of 16 and 19
have been rising since the 1970s. The rate in 1973 was 61.4 per 1,000 persons. This rate grew to
64.8 in 1983, to 77.9 in 1992, and to 91.1 in 1998. Using data from the 1994 National Crime
Victimization Survey, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (1996) also reports that teens of ages 16-19
have the highest rates of victimization as compared to all other age groups for all types of violent
crimes, including rape and robbery (121.7 per 1000 people) and assault (104.8 per 1000 people).
The homicide victimization rate for teens ages 14-17 increased almost 125 percent from 19851995, whereas the same rate increase by only 9 percent from 1976-1985. The rate at which teens
commit homicides have also been increasing. These rates fell between 1976 and 1985 from 10.6
to 9.8 offenders per 100,000 population, but then increased to 23.6 in 1995 (Bureau of Justice
Statistics, 1999b).
A Recent Gallup poll highlights the prevalence of violence and weapons in the lives of
teenagers. A 1999 survey finds that 17 percent of student say that “students bringing weapons to
school” is a “very big” or “big” problem in their school. “Gangs and violence” are the third most
often cited problem teenagers say faces people their age. Three in ten teenagers fear for their
physical safety when they are in school (Newport, 1999).
An important question for designing policies to reduce violence is to know what causes
teens to engage in violence and to carry weapons. Certainly a wide variety of factors contribute

to the culture of violence faced by today’s teenagers including family structure, environment,
and peer behavior. One of the most widely cited correlates of violent behavior is alcohol and
drug use, although it is not clear from the current literature that there exists a direct causal
relationship from drugs or alcohol to violence. This paper will examine the causal role of
alcohol and drug consumption in determining the probabilities of being in a physical fight,
carrying a gun, or carrying weapons other than guns. While the later two acts are not necessarily
violent acts, carrying a weapon implies the potential for violence. Simple ordinary least squares
regression models are compared to two-stage least squares models in which the potential
unmeasured correlation between substance use and violence is purged by the use of instrumental
variables. Prices of drugs and alcohol serve as instruments. Results indicate that beer and
marijuana consumption do play a causal role in instigating physical fights, while cocaine use
appears to have no relationship. None of the substances lead to increased probabilities of
carrying a gun or other weapon. Given that there is evidence of a causal relationship for physical
violence, a secondary aim of this paper is to examine the direct effects that increases in the price
of beer, marijuana and cocaine may have in reducing the incidence of fighting.

THE LITERATURE
The link between violent behaviors and substance use
The association between drug or alcohol use and violent behaviors is well documented
for both youths and adults. In research on adult violence, alcohol and drug consumption has
frequently been shown to be a correlate of criminal violence (see Miczek et al. 1993 for a
complete review of this literature). Studies by Kwon et al. (1997), Jarrell and Howsen (1990)
and Kellermann et al. (1993) all show that higher alcohol consumption or availability is

2

associated with higher rates of gun-related fatalities. Kellermann et al. (1993) shows that illicit
drug use positively associated with homicides. Studies on domestic violence also show a link
between alcohol consumption and violence (Gelles and Cornell, 1990 and Leonard, 1993).
In considering violence by youths, Rossow, et al. (1999) and Bernburg and Thorlindsson
(1999) show that when violence is measured as specific acts such as beating or threaten to beat
someone or having been in a fight with a weapon, frequent intoxication will lead to increased
violence, as will use of marijuana or other drugs. Salts and Lindholm (1995) find that alcohol
and marijuana use are highly associated with increased violent behaviors in both black and white
adolescent males. Similar findings hold for teens of both genders when examining drug use and
violence in school (Furlong et al. 1997).
Weapon carrying by youths is also correlated with drug and alcohol use. Miller et al.
(1999) find a strong association between drinking, drugs and gun ownership by college students
in the College Alcohol Study. Their results show that among students who binge drink, 4.3
percent own a gun as compared with 2.9 percent who do not binge drink. A more striking
number is that 12.4 percent of the students who report they need a drink first thing in the
morning own a gun. Seven percent of gun owners used crack or cocaine during the semester as
compared to 3 percent of students who did not own a gun. Sheley and Brewer (1995) find that
drug activity (either using or selling) positively influences the likelihood of carrying a gun.
Hemenway et al. (1996) find the same result for alcohol consumption.

The causality issue
It is important to note that none of these studies establish a direction of causality from
alcohol consumption or drug use to violent acts. In fact, there is no general agreement in the

3

existing literature on the direction of the causality. One prominent theory is that alcohol use
does cause violence by acting through a pharmacological mechanism that alters behavior
(Pernanen, 1981 and Fagan, 1993). A competing theory proposes reverse causality where
violence may cause alcohol consumption in that people who plan on being violent may drink in
order to give themselves courage or an excuse for the behavior (Fagan, 1990 and Cordilia, 1985).
Finally, a third theory states that alcohol and violence are both outcomes of an unobserved third
factor, for example, a risk-taking personality (Fagan, 1990).
Even less is known about why youths carry weapons. One commonly cited reason is that
of protection (Hemenway et al. 1996), while other research has shown that weapon carrying is a
result of antisocial attitudes and behaviors (Page and Hammermeister, 1997). A third hypothesis
is the “replicative externalities” model where adolescents feel less safe when their classmates
carry guns causing them in turn to acquire guns (Hemenway et al. 1996). These theories all
imply that the link between substance use and weapon carrying are a result of a third factor, be it
measureable or unmeasurable. While there is little reason to believe that short-term alcohol use
will directly cause teens to carry weapons, participation in the illegal drug market may promote
weapon carrying (Goldstein 1985). In addition, long-term use of alcohol, marijuana, opiates,
amphetamines or PCP can alter the nervous system in a way that actually promotes tendencies
towards violence, while cocaine use can lead to paranoid or psychotic states in which violence
may occur (National Research Council, 1993 and Goldstein, 1985).

Evidence from the economics literature
Some evidence of a causal relationship from drugs and alcohol to physical violence has
emerged from the economics literature. This literature looks at the direct effects of substance

4

prices and other related regulations on violence. Any observed direct effects of the price of
alcohol on occurrences of violence implies causality from consumption to violence because there
is no reason to expect any correlation between prices and violence except through consumption.
Grossman and Markowitz (forthcoming) examine the relationship between the price of alcohol
and violence on college campuses. The measures of violence used in this paper are indicators for
whether the student has gotten in trouble with authorities; has damaged property or pulled a fire
alarm; has gotten into an argument or a fight; and has taken advantage of another person sexually
or has been taken advantage of sexually. Results of this paper show that increasing the price of
alcohol would be a viable mechanism to reduce the incidence of these measures of violent
behaviors. In addition to the reduced form estimates of price on violence, this paper also uses a
two-stage least squares estimation technique similar to the one used in this paper to examine the
direct effects of consumption on violence. Results show that alcohol consumption does in fact
cause college students to engage in violent activities.
Other evidence of a causal link comes from studies on domestic violence (Markowitz and
Grossman, 1998, forthcoming and Markowitz, 1999) and crime (Cook and Moore, 1993 and
Chaloupka and Saffer, 1992). The studies on domestic violence show that higher alcoholic
beverage prices lead to lower incidence of both child abuse and wife abuse. In studies on crime,
Cook and Moore (1993) and Chaloupka and Saffer (1992) examine the effects of alcohol prices
on a time series of aggregate state crime rates in the United States. In particular, both sets of
authors look at rates of murder, rape, assault, and robbery. Results of these studies indicate that
increasing the tax on beer reduces most types of violent crimes (with the exception of assault).
Other evidence on the effects of alcohol consumption and its availability on crime rates comes
from Scandinavian studies. Lenke (1975) and Takala (1973) look at changes in alcohol prices,

5

incidence of strikes by employees of liquor stores, and introduction of new sales points (i.e.
selling beer in grocery stores) to explain changes in violent crime rates. Both studies show that
violent crimes decrease when alcohol is less available.

ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK
Two simple equations highlight the possible relationships between violence and drug or
alcohol consumption:
1) Vit = α 0 + α 1 Ait + α 2 Ejt + α 3 Xit + α 4 ui + ε it ,
2) Ait = β 0 + β 1 Vit + β 2 Pjt + β 3 Yit + β 4 ui + ωit ,
where V represents a measure of violence or weapon carrying, A is a measure of alcohol or drug
use, P is the full price of alcohol or drugs, E represents variables affecting violence levels such
as law enforcement or gun control measures, and X and Y and represent observed individual
characteristics which may affect violence (X) and drug and alcohol use (Y). The vectors X and
Y may have many of the same elements in common. Unobserved individual traits, such as
personality or propensity towards violence, which do not vary over time are represented by ui.
The subscripts i, j, and t, refer to individuals, geographic area, and time, respectively.
Many of the studies discussed in the literature review have used ordinary least
squares (OLS) regression to estimate equation 1. However, estimating equation 1 by OLS
can lead to biased and inconsistent coefficients if there is reverse causality present (β 1 ≠ 0)
or the unmeasured individual-level factor is correlated with violence and substance use (α 4
≠ 0 and β 4 ≠0). If either is the case, drug and alcohol consumption will be correlated with
the error term in equation 1, thus estimating the coefficients by OLS will violate the
requirement that the right-hand side variables be orthogonal to the error term. In the case of

6

reverse causality when there is no third factor present, alcohol is correlated with the error term in
the violence equation because all the same exogenous variables, including the error term, that
determine violence also determine alcohol consumption. This can be seen by substituting
equation 1 into equation 2. In the case where the third factor is present but there is no reverse
causality, ui is present in both the violence and alcohol equations, thus, alcohol consumption is
correlated with the error term in the violence equation.
In order to avoid the problems presented by OLS estimation, the two-stage least
squares (TSLS) technique is used to estimate equation 1. This instrumental variable
technique requires at least one exogenous variable (instrument) that will predict drug and
alcohol use but which is not correlated with the error term in the violence equation. When
estimating equation 1 by TSLS, drug and alcohol consumption are first predicted by the
instruments and then the predicted values are used as regressors in equation 1. The
predicted values of consumption are purged of their correlation with the error term in the
violence equation, leading to unbiased estimates of drugs and alcohol use on violence. A
positive coefficient on predicted alcohol or drug consumption will indicate that increased
substance use causes increased violence. A zero coefficient rules out causality.
A reduced form violence equation can be derived by substituting equation 2 into
equation 1:
3) Vit = δ 0 + δ 1 Pjt + δ 2 Ejt + δ 3 Yit + δ 4 Xit + δ 5 uI + ηit ,
where δ 0 = (α 0 + α 1 β 0 )/(1-α 1 β 1 ); δ 1 =α 1 β 2 /(1-α 1 β 1 ); δ 2 =α 2 ; δ 3 =α 1 β 3 /(1-α 1 β 1 ); δ 4 =α 3 /(1α 1 β 1 ); δ 5 =(α 1 β 4 + α 4 )/(1-α 1 β 1 ); and ηit = (ε it + α 1 ωit )/(1-α 1 β 1 ). Estimating the reduced form
equation shows the direct effect of changes in the prices of drugs and alcohol in reducing
violence or weapon carrying. A negative price coefficient implies that violence is caused

7

by consumption since there is no intuitive reason to believe that the prices of drugs and
alcohol are determinants of violence holding consumption constant.1 An insignificant
coefficient would provide evidence against causality. Thus, the reduced form estimation
will serve as a check on the validity of the results from the instrumental variable estimation
as well as directly providing the magnitude of the effect of changing prices on the
incidence of violence or potential violence.

DATA
Data on violent behaviors and drug and alcohol consumption come from the 1991, 1993
and 1995 National School-Based Youth Risk Behavior Surveys.2 These surveys contain
nationally representative samples of high school students in grades 9-12. In each year, a
different sample of students is interviewed. Dependent variables are constructed from the
questions on physical fighting and the carrying of weapons. The first dependent variable is a
dichotomous indicator for whether the respondent had been in a physical fight in the past year.
The second is a dichotomous indicator for whether the respondent has carried a gun in the past
30 days, and the third is a dichotomous indicator for whether the respondent carried a weapon
other than a gun, such as a knife or club, in the past 30 days. Information on yearly weapon
carrying or fighting in the past 30 days is not available from the survey questionnaire. Caution
must be exercised in interpreting the meaning of the weapon carrying variable. While the survey
question does ask the respondent specifically about carrying a weapon, it may be possible that
teens who carry pocket knives (such as Swiss Army knives) and who have no violent intentions
will respond positively to this question.
The questions on alcohol include the number of days in the past thirty days on which the
respondent had at least one drink of alcohol (termed drink), and the number of days in the past

8

thirty days on which the respondent had five or more drinks of alcohol in a row within a couple
of hours (termed binge). Questions on drug use include the number of times in the past thirty
days the respondent used marijuana (termed marijuana) and the number of times in the past thirty
days the respondent used any form of cocaine including crack, powder, or freebase (termed
cocaine).
The socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the respondents are very limited
in that only age, gender, and race, are consistently reported in all surveys. All of these variables
are included in each model. Four additional measures which may help control for the
respondent’s personality or propensity towards risk are also included. The first is an indicator of
how often the respondent wears a seatbelt when he or she is a passenger in a car, the second is if
the respondent seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, the third is the number of
sports teams run by either the school or an outside organization on which the respondent plays,
and the fourth is the number of days in the past thirty days on which the respondent smoked.
These variables may be endogenous in that they may be determined by the same unmeasured
factors that predict violence and/or drug and alcohol use. They are included because these
variables should not be causal determinants of violence, with the possible exception of suicide.
Models were tested which first exclude only the suicide indicator and second, exclude all four
measures of risk. For each of the substances, in models which exclude only the suicide variable,
the results are virtually unchanged. In models without all four variables, the OLS coefficients on
drugs and alcohol become larger in magnitude, although statistical significance is unaffected.
The TSLS estimates become smaller in absolute value and statistical significance is unaffected
for fighting and gun carrying. The TSLS estimates of the drinking and drug use variables on
weapon carrying remains negative but become insignificant in all equations, thus the results for

9

other weapons will be discussed with this caveat in mind.
Since the set of individual characteristics is very limited in these data, some state-level
variables are included to proxy for some of the unmeasured individual-level characteristics. All
models include the percentage of the respondent’s state that are Mormon, Protestants, Southern
Baptist and Catholic, as well as real income per capita and the unemployment rate. Data on
religious affiliation in 1990 and come from Bradley et al. (1992). Data for 1991, 1993 and 1995
are interpolated based on a rate of growth from 1980 to 1990. Data on real income come from
the Bureau of Economic Analysis and unemployment figures come from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.

Instruments
Variables measuring the price of drugs and alcohol will serve as instruments which
are used to predict consumption but not violence. The prices are theoretically valid
instruments because there is little reason to believe that the prices of drugs and alcohol are
predictors of teen violence or weapon carrying, holding consumption constant. Prices
should, however, predict consumption. Previous research has show that consumption of
these goods is negatively related to their prices. (Leung and Phelps, 1993; Grossman, et al.
1998; and Grossman and Chaloupka, 1998; Saffer and Chaloupka, 1999).
Three variables will be used as instruments: The real (1982-1984=1) state-level
excise tax on beer, the real price of cocaine, and an indicator for whether a state has
decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. Prices of
marijuana are generally not available so the decriminalization indicator is used instead.
For this variable, a value of 1 means the state has decriminalized, thus users in these states

10

face a lower expected penalty and a lower price of possessing marijuana. Beer taxes come
from the Beer Association’s Brewer’s Almanac, cocaine prices come from the Drug
Enforcement Administration's System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence
(STRIDE) and information on decriminalization of marijuana comes from the Bureau of
Justice Statistics (1995). Cocaine prices are available until 1994, so the 1995 data are
assigned cocaine prices for 1994. The methodology for creating the cocaine price series is
described in detail in Grossman and Chaloupka (1998). In addition to the three true
instruments, all the above mentioned state-level and individual-level characteristics are
used to predict consumption, although these variables also appear in the second stage
equations as well.

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations of all the variables for the full sample
and by response for the three measures of violence. Any observations with missing data are
omitted from the analyses. Forty percent of the sample report having been in at least one
physical fight in the past year, seven percent report carrying a gun in the last 30 days, and 15
percent report having carried a weapon other than a gun in the last 30 days. In addition, 48
percent of the sample drank, 19 percent binge drank, 17 percent used marijuana and 2 percent
used cocaine in the last 30 days. These rates of teenage substance use are similar to that found in
the Monitoring the Future Study (Johnston, et al. 1998).
The rates of drug and alcohol use by respondents who report positive instances of
fighting or weapon carrying are much higher than that for respondents who do not fight or carry
weapons. For respondents who fight, the rates of participation are 61 percent, 30 percent, 26

11

percent and 5 percent for drinking, bingeing, marijuana and cocaine use, respectively. The same
rates for respondents with no fighting history are 39 percent, 13 percent, 11 percent and one
percent, respectively. For respondents who carry a gun, participation rates for drinking,
bingeing, marijuana and cocaine use are 77 percent, 48 percent, 44 percent, and 13 percent,
respectively. Again, the drug and alcohol use is much lower for respondents who do not report
carrying a gun; 46 percent drink, 17 percent binge, 15 percent use marijuana and 2 percent use
cocaine. Similar trends hold for respondents who carry other types of weapons (64 percent
versus 45 for drinking, 30 percent versus 18 for bingeing, 26 percent versus 16 for marijuana,
and 4 percent versus 2 percent for cocaine use.) All of these proportions are statistically
different from each other.
The Youth Risk Behavior Surveys record the number of occasions on which the
respondent used an illegal substance. As with the participation rates, the number of occasions on
which the respondent drank, binged, used marijuana or used cocaine is much higher for
respondents who report fighting or carrying a weapon (see Table 1).
Along with higher rates of substance use, people who fight are more likely to carry a gun
(14 percent) or other weapon (23 percent) than those who do not fight (3 percent and 9 percent,
respectively). In addition, of the people who carry guns, 75 percent have been in a physical
fight. This is compared to only 37 percent of people who do not carry guns. Finally, of the
people who carry other weapons, 63 percent have been in a physical fight versus 36 percent of
people who do not carry other weapons. Unfortunately, because of the wording of the survey
question, it is impossible to determine the rates of multiple weapon carrying, i.e. the rates of gun
carrying given other weapon carrying.

ESTIMATION AND RESULTS
The structural model
Linear probability methods are used to estimate equation 1. Logit models were tested but
the conclusions remain unchanged. Models were also tested which correct the standard errors
according to White (1980) and the standard errors remain virtually unchanged.
Tables 2 and 3 show the results of bingeing, drinking, marijuana use and cocaine use
separately on the probability of being in a physical fight (columns 1 and 2), carrying a gun
(columns 3 and 4), and carrying a weapon other than a gun (columns 5 and 6).3 Table 2 presents
the results for binge drinking while Table 3 shows the results for drinking, marijuana use and
cocaine use. For brevity, the coefficients on all variables are shown in Table 2 while only the
coefficients on the illicit substances are shown in Table 3. The results of the other variables in
the regressions do not vary depending on the inclusion or exclusion of a particular substance.
Columns 1, 3 and 5 of these tables show the OLS results and columns 2, 4, and 6 show the TSLS
results. Three tests of the validity of the TSLS regressions are reported. The first is an Ftest on the set of true instruments. Bound et al. (1995) show that as the F-statistic on the
instruments gets smaller, the bias in the TSLS estimates approaches that of OLS. Thus, is it
important for the instruments to have explanatory power in predicting consumption. Second, the
Basmann (1960) overidentification test is presented. An insignificant value of this test indicates
that the overidentification restrictions are valid. In other words, an insignificant value indicates
that the instruments are not mistakenly left out of the second stage, and they are not correlated
with the error term. Finally, the Hausman (1978) test shows if the OLS estimators are consistent.
The first stage results for binge drinking, drinking, marijuana use and cocaine use are shown in
Appendix Table 2. The first stage models presented are based on the regressions for physical

13

fighting since the first stage results are very similar to that of the other two dependent variables,
and vary only because of missing values on the dependent variables.
The OLS results of Table 2 show that binge drinking is positive and statistically
significantly related to physical fighting, carrying a gun and carrying an other type of weapon.
These OLS results are consistent with the literature discussed above. The TSLS estimates tell a
slightly different story. For physical fighting, the TSLS estimate confirms the OLS estimate.
Here, the coefficient on binge drinking is positive and significant, although the magnitude is ten
times larger than the OLS estimate. The interpretation of the TSLS coefficient is that one less
day on which the average respondent binges will lead to an decrease in the probability of being
in a physical fight by 0.108 (or 10.8 percentage points). While this effect seems large, one must
recognize that a one day decrease in the average number of days binged represents a 47 percent
decrease in the mean number of days binged. In elasticity form, a one percent decrease in
number of days on which a respondent binges will decrease the probability of being in a physical
fight by 0.293 percent.4
The statistics at the bottom of the even numbered columns check the validity of the TSLS
estimates. In column 2, the F-test on the instruments shows that the prices of drugs and beer are
statistically significant predictors of binge drinking. Second, the overidentification restrictions
are valid, and third, consistency of the OLS coefficient is rejected. These tests provide evidence
that the TSLS is the appropriate technique for estimation and that the TSLS results for physical
fighting are unbiased.
The TSLS results for the probability of carrying a gun do not confirm the OLS results.
The coefficient on binge drinking in the TSLS model (column 4) is negative and not statistically
significant. Interestingly, the F-test of the instruments in the first stage are statistically

14

significant, and the overidentification restrictions are valid. However, the difference in the two
estimates is not large enough to result in a significant value of the Hausman test, thus
consistency of the OLS estimator cannot be rejected.
As with the probability of carrying guns, the OLS estimation of binge drinking on the
probability of carrying weapons shows a positive relationship, however this result becomes
negative once the unobserved correlation between binge drinking and carrying a weapon has
been purged. The coefficient on the TSLS estimate in column 6 of Table 2 is –0.08, indicating
that a one percent decrease in the number of binge drinking occasions will actually raise the
probability of carrying a weapon by 0.675 percent. The TSLS results for other weapons are
trustworthy because the first stage instruments are significant, the overidentification restrictions
are valid and consistency of OLS is rejected.
The negative coefficients on binge drinking in the weapon carrying equation and the gun
carrying equation (the latter of which is not statistically significant) are at odds with the evidence
provided by the simple means presented in Table 1 and with the OLS estimation in Table 2. At
this point, some additional checks on the validity of this result are offered. One explanation for
this result may be based on the states the teenagers live in. The TSLS estimation relies on
variations in the state level prices of drugs and alcohol to predict consumption. In order for the
TSLS coefficient to be negative, states which have higher prices of drugs and alcohol also must
have higher probabilities of weapon carrying. If higher beer taxes are observed in states that are
traditional hunting states (as is the case in the southern states) then a positive relationship would
appear between taxes and weapon carrying, leading to a negative relationship between binge
drinking and weapon carrying. Estimates in Table 4 attempt to control for unobserved area
effects, although as shown below, adding dummies for the region of the country still results in

15

negative coefficients on the TSLS estimates for guns and other weapons, although the standard
errors of these coefficients increase. In order to further test the theory that the some weapons are
being carried for recreational purposes, a new dependent variable was created which takes on a
value of one only if the respondent carried any type of weapon to school. This question is only
available in the 1993 and 1995 cross sections. Results are not shown, but the TSLS coefficient
on binge drinking remains negative and significant at the 10 percent level in a two-tailed test
when using this dependent variable. In light of this evidence, the most plausible explanation for
the contradictory results is that the OLS estimates are biased and there is indeed no positive
causal relationship between substance use and weapon carrying, rather the positive simple
correlation between the two behaviors is a reflection of some other unmeasured trait.
The results of the other independent variables generally do not depend on the method of
estimation (OLS versus TSLS) and are fairly consistent across the dependent variables as well.
For example, older teens are less likely to fight or carry guns and other weapons, as are females
and teens who report wearing a seatbelt when they are a passenger in a car. Being black,
Hispanic or of another non-white race is associated with higher probabilities of being in physical
fights and carrying guns. There is no association with other weapons for blacks, while Hispanics
and other races are less likely to carry other weapons. Teens who smoke are more likely to
engage in all three acts, although with the exception of the regressions that include cocaine use,
this result only holds in the OLS estimates. The most likely explanation for the insignificant
coefficient in the TSLS models is that smoking is being used to predict consumption in the first
stage, and since smoking, drinking and marijuana use are highly correlated, the effects of
smoking are being picked up by the predicted values of consumption in the second stage.5 Teens
who have thought about committing suicide are more likely to engage in violent behaviors, as are

16

teens who play on sports teams. This last result does not hold for other weapons. Finally, the
larger the percentage of the state that is reported to be Southern Baptist the lower the probability
of physical fighting but the higher the probability of carrying weapons other than guns. More
Catholics in a state leads to a lower probability of carrying a gun.
Table 3 shows the coefficients on drinking, marijuana use and cocaine use on the
probability of physical fights, carrying a gun and carrying other weapons. The effects of
drinking (panel A) and using marijuana (panel B) on these three variables are very similar to that
of binge drinking. The OLS and TSLS estimations both show that drinking and marijuana use
are positively related to the probability of physical fighting. The TSLS estimates show that a one
percent decrease in the mean number of days of drinking will decrease the probability of fighting
by 0.42 percent, while a one percent decrease in the mean number of occasions on which
marijuana is used will decrease the probability of fighting by 0.25 percent. Whereas the OLS
results show that drinking or using marijuana is positively related to carrying a gun or other
weapon, the coefficients from the TSLS estimations are negative and insignificant for gun use
and negative and significant for other weapon carrying. For all three dependent variables, when
drinking is being considered, the instruments in the first stage are statistically significant
predictors, the overidentification restrictions are valid and consistency of OLS is rejected. The
same holds for marijuana use. The results of cocaine use on physical fighting and weapon
carrying are less trustworthy. The OLS results show that cocaine use is positively related to
physical fighting and gun use, but has no statistically significant relationship with other weapon
carrying. The TSLS coefficients for fighting and other weapon carrying are positive but are not
statistically significant, however, consistency of OLS is never rejected.
Table 4 re-estimates the models in Tables 2 and 3, but includes three dummy variables

17

for the region of the country in which the respondent lives. The areas are the Northeast,
Midwest, and South. The West is the omitted category. Regions are included in order to further
control for unobserved state-level variation that may be correlated with teenager’s substance use
and violent behaviors. Recall that the measures such as religion, unemployment and real per
capita income also help control for unobservables. State dummies were tested, but are not used
for two reasons. First, only 38 states are represented in the three years of the survey and not all
states are available in all years. In order to include dummies for every state, a state would have
to appear in more than one year so as to not be collinear with the other state level variables.
Including only the respondents who live in states that are surveyed in multiple years reduces the
number of respondents by about 12 percent and includes only 23 states. Secondly, by including
the state dummies, the TSLS estimates become biased because the first stage results are
unreliable. This is a result of the state level prices being highly collinear with the state dummies
which leads to the problems associated with severe multicollinearity.6 Nevertheless, including
state dummies does not alter the OLS results.
Including dummies for the broader regions of the country rather than the state dummies
allows the entire sample to be included, as well as minimizing the problem of multicollinearity in
the first stage.7 Table 4 shows the coefficients on the illicit substances. Across all models, the
OLS results remain unchanged from the corresponding estimates in Tables 2 and 3. The TSLS
estimates are also similar in sign and magnitude, but generally lose statistical significance. For
example, without regional dummies, the TSLS estimate of binge drinking is 0.108 and is
significant at the 5 percent level. With the regional dummies the coefficient falls to 0.062 and
becomes insignificant at conventional levels. Note that the F-statistic on the instruments in the
first stages have fallen. This indicates that with the regional dummies, the instruments are only

18

weak predictors of substance use, thus the bias in the TSLS estimate approaches that of OLS.
Interestingly, the coefficients on binge drinking and drinking in the other weapon equation
remain negative and are statistically significant at the 10 percent level in a two-tailed test when
regional dummies are included.
In summary, the TSLS results in Tables 2-4 show evidence that higher alcohol and
marijuana use leads to an increased probability of physical fighting. These results also show that
increased drug and alcohol use do not lead to a higher probability of carrying guns or other types
of weapons. What is not clear, however, is why a possible negative relationship appears
between drinking or marijuana use and carrying weapons other than guns after the correlation
with the error term has been purged. Recall that the coefficients on bingeing and drinking are
negative and statistically significant in equations which both include and exclude regional
dummies, although in models of other weapon carrying which exclude the four potentially
endogenous measures of risk the coefficients on the substances are not statistically different from
zero.
The existence of, and possible explanation for the negative coefficient on weapon
carrying needs further investigation. One suggestion for why the negative relationship emerges
is that weapons and drugs are substitute goods, that is, that teens spend their income on either
drugs or weapons. As is discussed further below, the reduced form estimates presented in Table
5 presents some evidence that the alcohol and weapons are net substitute goods. A second
possible explanation deals with the costs of engaging in criminal behavior. Becker (1968)
describes a model of crime in which the criminal’s choice level of crime is determined by
weighing the probable costs and benefits of crime. The model can be expanded to include the
role of alcohol or drugs in affecting the probability of getting caught and facing penalties. In

19

other words, if it is the case that alcohol or drug consumption affects an individual’s behavior in
such a way as to impair judgement, then a careful criminal would be less likely to consume these
substances for fear of raising the probability of getting caught (Cordilia, 1985). This argument
may be more relevant for property crimes than violent crimes, and in fact, Markowitz and
Grossman (1998, forthcoming) argue that alcohol consumption lowers rather than raises the
probability of getting caught in the case of domestic violence where alcohol can be used as an
excuse for the violence.

The reduced form
Estimating the reduced form model as shown in equation 3 provides indirect evidence for
or against the causality link from substance use to violence, as well as providing the magnitude
of the direct effect of changes in the prices of the substances on the probability of violence. If
drinking alcohol, for example, actually causes teens to engage in physical fights, and beer taxes
are negatively related to drinking, then one would expect the beer tax to be negatively related to
physical fighting in the reduced form. If there is no causal relationship from substance use to a
measure of violence then the prices should have no direct effect on violence. In the case of
weapons, since both goods are purchased with income, the reduced form will also show whether
the goods are net substitutes, complements, or have no relation to each other.
Table 5 shows the results of the reduced form estimates for physical fighting (column 1),
carrying a gun (column 2) and carrying an other type of weapon (column 3). The negative and
statistically significant coefficient on the beer tax in the physical fight equation confirms the
TSLS estimates from Table 2. This result indicates that a one percent increase in the beer tax
will lower the probability of physical fighting by 0.02 percent. The marijuana decriminalization

20

indicator and the price of cocaine have no direct effects on physical fighting. For cocaine, but
not for marijuana, this result is consistent with the TSLS results. The likely explanation for the
contradictory marijuana result is that the decriminalization indicator is a poor measure of the
price of marijuana and thus has no direct effect on fighting. Nevertheless, marijuana
consumption may still be adequately predicted by the models in Table 3 if the price of beer
predicts marijuana use due to complementarity or substitutability between the two substances.8
As shown in Appendix Table 2, the first stage results for marijuana use confirm that this is the
case since the coefficient on the decriminalization indicator is positive (although not statistically
significant), and the coefficient on the beer tax is negative and statistically significant.
The TSLS results in Tables 2 and 3 for the probability of carrying a gun show no
statistically significant relationship between drinking or drug use and carrying a gun, although
the coefficients on binge drinking, drinking and marijuana use are all negative. The reduced
form is in agreement with these results, for column 2 of Table 5 shows that none of the prices are
statistically significant predictors of carrying a gun.
Finally, column 3 of Table 5 shows the reduced form equation for other weapon carrying.
Recall that the TSLS estimate predicts that the more days on which a respondent drinks will lead
to a lower probability of weapon carrying. This result is confirmed by the reduced form where
the tax on beer is positively related to weapon carrying. The marijuana decriminalization
indicator and cocaine price have no relationship with other weapon carrying. These results also
provide evidence that beer consumption and weapons such as knives are net substitute goods
since increasing the price of beer will increase the probability of carrying a weapon, holding real
income constant. Note that the income effect estimated here is imprecise since income is
measured by a state-level per capita income and is not adjusted for the cost of living faced by

21

teens.
Including the 3 regional dummies does not alter the sign or the magnitude of the reduced
form equations in Table 5 (results not shown). However, the addition of the dummies does raise
the standard errors of the three price coefficients. For physical fighting, the beer tax coefficient
becomes significant at only the 13 percent level in a two-tailed test. For guns, the beer tax and
marijuana decriminalization coefficients remain insignificant, and for other weapons, the beer
tax remains positive and significant at the 10 percent level.

CONCLUSION
The purpose of this study is to examine the question of whether alcohol and drug use
cause teenagers to engage in violent behaviors as measured by physical fighting, carrying a gun,
or carrying other types of weapons. Evidence from simple means and OLS regression estimation
show that drinking (as measured by number of days the respondent had a drink and by the
number of days the respondent had 5 or more drinks in a one sitting), marijuana use and cocaine
use are all positively related to the probability of physical fighting, carrying a gun and carrying
an other type of weapon. While drugs, alcohol and violent behaviors may be linked, these
simple results do not provide evidence of causality from drugs and alcohol to violence or
potential violence. In fact, the OLS estimates may be biased because of the possibility that both
substance use and violent behaviors are determined by unmeasured individual traits.
Causality can be established by using two-stage least squares to estimate the drug and
alcohol consumption coefficients. The technique predicts consumption using the prices of beer,
marijuana and cocaine, and then predicted rather than actual consumption is used in the violence
equation. This technique allows the consumption measures to be purged of their correlation with

22

unobserved individual characteristics. Results from the two-stage estimation show that binge
drinking, drinking and marijuana use are all causal determinants of physical violence. Cocaine
use has no relationship with physical fighting. None of the substances lead to increased
probabilities of carrying a gun or other weapon. The magnitudes of the effect on fighting of a
decrease in drinking or marijuana use may be very small. A one percent decrease in the mean
number of days on which a respondent binges will decrease the probability of being in a physical
fight by 0.29 percent. The percentage reductions in fighting from a one percent decrease in the
number of days of drinking or using marijuana are 0.42 percent and 0.25 percent, respectively.
Reduced form estimates provide additional evidence of the causal link from drinking to
physical violence, and also show the direct effect of raising substance prices on the probability of
physical violence. Policies aimed at reducing alcohol consumption, such as raising the price of
beer through increased taxes, would be effective in reducing both consumption the incidence of
physical fights, although again, the magnitude may be very small. A one percent increase in the
beer tax will lower the probability of physical fighting by 0.02 percent. Re-criminalizing
marijuana or raising the price of cocaine through increased enforcement of drug laws would have
no direct effects on violence.

One exception may be if the violence is committed by illegal drug sellers trying to

maintain monopoly prices or exclusive territories. In this sample, the proportion of teenagers
who sell illegal drugs is unknown. However, in the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth, the proportion is fairly low, about 6.6 percent sell or help to sell illegal drugs. In
addition, only 1.4 percent of the sample sold drugs regularly, that is, more than once a month for
12 months, and the majority report earning less than $100.00.
2

Data are available for 1997 as well. Since cocaine prices are only available until 1994,

the 1997 data are not used. However, Appendix Table 1 shows results for models which use all
4 available years of data by excluding the cocaine price and consumption variables from all
models. The magnitude and statistical significance of the OLS coefficients are very similar to
those in Tables 2 and 3. The TSLS coefficients are similar in magnitude, but the standard errors
increase, and the F-tests on the instruments in the first stage are only significant in the binge
drinking equation.
3

Each substance is entered into a violence equation separately since including

consumption of all three substances together in one TSLS model leads to severe multicollinearity

28

between the predicted values. This occurs because all three substances are predicted using the
same set of variables.
4

The elasticity is calculated by multiplying the coefficient on binge drinking by the ratio

of the average number of days binged to the proportion of respondents who fight. A similar
fromula is used for the other measures of substance use and violence.
5

The simple correlation coefficients between smoking and binge drinking, drinking and

marijuana use are all approximately 0.40.
6

In fact, a combination of state and time dummies almost perfectly predict the beer taxes.

The R-squared from a regression of the beer tax on the state dummies and year dummies is
0.985. The R-squared is 0.886 for a regression of the decriminalization on the state and year
dummies and is 0.953 for cocaine price on state and year dummies.
7

The R-squares of substance price on region and year dummies are much lower: 0.28,

0.33, and 0.28 for the beer tax, marijuana decriminalization and cocaine price, respectively.
8

Saffer and Chaloupka (1998) and Farrelly et al. (1999) show evidence that beer and

marijuana are complement goods.
