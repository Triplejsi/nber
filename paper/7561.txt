The Effect of Immigration on Native Self-Employment
Robert W. Fairlie and Bruce D. Meyer
NBER Working Paper No. 7561
February 2000
JEL No. J23, J61
ABSTRACT
A rapidly growing literature examines the impact of immigrants on the labor market
outcomes of native-born Americans. However, the impact of immigration on natives in selfemployment has not been examined, despite the over-representation of immigrants in that sector.
We first present a new general equilibrium model of self-employment and wage/salary work. For
a range of plausible parameter values, the model predicts small negative effects of immigration on
native self-employment rates and earnings. Using 1980 and 1990 Census microdata, we then
examine the relationship between changes in immigration and native self-employment rates and
earnings across 132 of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States. We find evidence
supporting the hypothesis that self-employed immigrants displace self-employed natives. The effects
are much larger than those predicted by simulations of the theoretical model. Immigrants, however,
do not have a negative effect on native self-employment earnings. Our findings are similar if we
weight immigration rates by the propensity of immigrant groups to be self-employed or if we try
alternative estimation techniques and specifications.

Notes: From 132 metropolitan area sample of those aged 16-64. The self-employment rate is the
fraction of the employed that is self-employed. The self-employment ratio is the fraction of the
noninstitutional, not in school population that is self-employed. Census sample weights are used
in 1990.

Notes: From 132 metropolitan area sample of native-born nonblacks aged 16-64. The IV columns use the
1980 immigration variable to instrument for the change between 1980 and 1990. Standard errors are reported
in parentheses. The scaled derivative approximates the change in the number of self-employed natives when
the number of self-employed immigrants increases by one. The weighted immigrant share weights immigrant
groups by their self-employment rate (or ratio). All specifications include 1980 to 1990 changes in log average
income of natives, native unemployment rate, and log native population.
