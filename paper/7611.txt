Low Wage Services: Interpreting the US - German Difference
Richard Freeman and Ronald Schettkat
NBER Working Paper No. 7611
March 2000
ABSTRACT
Is the expansion of jobs in low-wage services in Europe restricted by high wages? With
services now the main sector source of employment growth this question becomes crucial and we
examine it through a detailed comparison of the role of low-wage services in the US and Germany.
We find a clear low-wage service ‘jobs deficit’ in Germany but this is not due to excessively high
German wages. Relative wages in low-wage sectors are extremely similar in the two countries. This
is a striking finding given the much wider wage distribution in the US. The explanation for this
phenomenon is the much greater intra-industry wage dispersion in the US producing similar industry
mean wages as the much narrower German distribution.

Services are the main sector of employment growth in advanced countries, and the principle area of
difference between US and Western European employment. Between 1970 and 1995 the US
increased the ratio of service employment to adult population by 15 percentage points while
manufacturing employment per adult fell. In Germany (West) manufacturing employment relative to
the population also fell while service sector employment per adult rose. Employment in service
sector jobs per adult increased by about 9 percentage points in Germany -- 6 points less than in the
US. The 6 point difference in the growth of service sector jobs per adult accounts for about 75% of
the 1980-1995 increased gap between the German and US employment-population ratios. Since
Germany and the US had similar employment-population rates in 1970, the service sector difference
also explains roughly 3/4ths of the actual 1995 US-German difference in employment-population
ratios overall.

Thus, service industries are crucial for any explanation of the US-German

differentials in employment trends.
The part of the service sector that has attracted most attention in discussions of German
unemployment are low wage service industries, where many low skill workers who make up a
disproportionate share of the unemployed might seek work. Analysts have argued that more
flexibility in both supply and demand at the low-wage end of the labour market would increase
employment in Germany and in the EU more broadly (e.g, Siebert 1997). Welfare state arrangements
in Germany, like social assistance, may create reservation wages for low-skilled workers above the
wages in low-paid jobs. On the demand side, collectively bargained wages may set a wage floor,
which pushes costs for low-skilled services to a level prohibitive for private service demand,
particularly when combined with non wage labour costs like social security contributions.
Reductions in social assistance and in labour costs would presumably generate more low wage
service employment, and thus lower German and EU unemployment.

2
Despite much policy discussion, there is little detailed empirical work comparing US and German
low-wage services. Analyzes have been either highly aggregative or based on a priori thinking,
rather than quantitative estimates of the key differences between low wage services in the US and
Germany, much less of the relevant elasticities of demand or supply that might explain these
differences. As a result there is some confusion about the basic facts regarding employment and
wages in low wage service sectors in the two countries, and little hard evidence about the nature and
causes of differences.
How much, in fact, does employment differ in low wage service sectors between the US and
Germany?
Are the same sectors low wage in both countries, and if so, how far are they below average pay in
each country?
Do the service sectors use similar proportions of low wage or low skill labour or do they employ
different skill mixes in the two countries?
What explains any low wage service sector jobs “deficit” in Germany relative to the US -- high
reservation wages? High labour costs? Or other differences between the two economies?
This paper seeks to provide facts to answer these questions and to clarify debate about the
contribution of the low wage service sector to the German employment problem. We find that:
1. Germany has a smaller low wage service sector than the US, though the ratio of low wage service
employment to population rose in Germany relative to the US from 1980 to 1995.
2. Low wage service industries are further below the national average in wages in Germany than in
the US. Adding to this difference, low wage service industries employ proportionately more skilled
workers in Germany than in the US, though women workers make up a much larger share of

3
employees in these areas in Germany.
3. A majority of low wage workers in Germany are found in a limited number of low wage service
sector industries and in a few low-paying occupations. By contrast, low wage workers are found
throughout the US job market.
In short, we find little support for the notion that the German-US deficit in low wage services is due
to excessively high wages in those industries in Germany. Given the existence of open
unemployment, we also see little support for the claim that low wage services face a labour shortage
due to high reservation wages in Germany. The difference in sectoral employment must thus lie in
some other differences between the economies, on which we offer some speculations.

1. The service sector employment difference
The starting point for our analysis is the basic fact that Germany has a smaller service sector than the
US. In Germany shares of national production, consumption and employment in services fall
below the equivalent shares in the US. (See table 1). Differences in shares, however, have no clear
implications for employment since by definition, a smaller share in one sector implies a larger share
in another. In this case the lower share of services in Germany implies that the country has relatively
higher output and employment in manufacturing than in the US.
To analyze the link between levels of employment and sector, we calculated the ratio of employment
in a sector to adult population: the number of workers employed in that sector per person of working
age. Since sectoral employment-population ratios add up to the total employment-population ratio,
they provide the appropriate statistic to assess the contribution of sectors to aggregate employment.
These statistics, also given in table 1, show that Germany has a somewhat higher manufacturing
employment to population ratio than the US but a much lower service sector employment ratio. As
noted in the opening paragraph, it is this difference that accounts for the decline and gap in the
employment–population ratio in Germany relative to the US.

4
Where do the low wage service industries fit into this picture?
To answer this question and provide a more detailed analysis of low wage services in Germany and
the US we use data from a new micro-based data set, the Comparable German-American Sectoral
Database (CGAS). The CGAS classifies workers in the two countries into comparable detailed
occupations (about 95) and industries (about 65) for the period 1970 to 1995. Within industry and
occupation it contains cells based on wages, occupation, industry, age, sex, and nationality, rather
than observations on individuals (which we could not get for Germany). Theoretically the data
allows for differentiation of about 1.2 million cells per year. The underlying sources of the data for
the CGAS database are the US Census of Population, the Current Population Survey, the German
Mikrozensus and German social security data (Beschaeftigtenstatistik). Combining these data files
provides us with hundreds of thousands of cells which allow for the detailed analysis of international
employment growth differentials after controlling for educational variables, gender, age etc. (for
more details see Freeman/ Schettkat 1998).
The first step in our analysis was to identify the major low wage services. We rank-ordered
industries in the CGAS by mean level of pay within Germany and the US. Table 2 lists the 15
industries at the low end of the distribution and gives their share of employment and employment to
population ratios in 1989 and 1995.

The upper panel uses the US wage structure to order the

industries. The lower panel uses the German wage structure. Both wage structures place essentially
the same industries at the bottom. Twelve out of the fifteen lowest paying industries are identical,
and six of the seven low paying service sector industries are the same. The key low wage services in
terms of number of employees are (in order) eating, drinking, and care facilities, retail trade, nonfood, retail trade, non-food. The other low wage services are private households, personal services,
services to dwellings, and business services, and other repair services. The figures on the share in
overall employment show that the service industries dominate the low wage sector.
Looking across countries, the share of workers in the low-paying industries in overall employment is
substantially higher in the US (27% upper panel, 28% lower panel) than in Germany (22% upper

5
panel, 20% lower panel), independent of the US or German ranking,. The difference is almost
entirely due to low wage services. In particular, the US employs a higher share of workers in 'eating,
drinking, care facilities' (7.7% compared to 4.9% in Germany), 'retail trade' (10.5% in food and nonfood retail trade compared to 9% in Germany), 'business services' (2.3% compared to .3% in
Germany). In 'personal services' relatively more persons are employed in Germany (1.7%) than in the
US (1.0%).
From 1989 to 1990, however, the employment to population rate for low wage service sectors in the
US barely changed, while the rate rose by about 2 percentage points in Germany. This reduced the
gap or deficit with the US by about one third. In 1989, the US had 6 percent more adults employed
in low wage services than Germany. In 1995, the US had about 4 percent more adults employed in
low wage services than Germany. Put differently, during the period of rising joblessness in
Germany, low wage services expanded more than in the US.
2. Low paying services in the industry wage structure
One possible reason for Germany having fewer workers in the low paying service sector than the US
is that wages in this 'low pay' area are higher relative to average pay than in the US. Given that
Germany has a much narrower distribution of wages overall than the US, this would seem to be a
reasonable possibility. If true, higher relative pay in German low wage services would provide some
support for a demand side interpretation of the German low wage service employment deficit: the
workers cost too much.
Surprisingly, the “wage difference” story turns out to be false. Table 3 displays industry-specific
wages relative to the mean wage in the US and Germany respectively. These data show that relative
wages of low-pay industries are strikingly similar in the two countries. Indeed, in 1995 the seven
lowest paying service sectors have an average pay that is 67 percent of mean wages in the US and 61
percent of mean wages in Germany. The lowest paying service, private households, pays about 45%
of the overall mean wage in both sectors; while pay in retail trade, both food and non-food, is 9
percentage points closer to the average in the US than in Germany. It is hard to argue, on the basis of

6
this evidence, that German low wage services are paying such relatively high wages as to reduce
greatly demand for these services, and thus that high wages in those sectors explains the lack of
employment.
The similarity in the position of low wage services in the industry wage structure between the US
and Germany seems to conflict with the well-established fact that the US has a much wider
distribution of wages overall than does Germany and that the bottom deciles of the US wage
distribution are much further from the median than the bottom deciles of the German wage
distribution (OECD, Employment Outlook, 1993).
The explanation that reconciles the difference between the distribution of wages among industries
and the overall distribution of wages is that the US has much greater intra-industry dispersion in
wages (Freeman/ Schettkat 1998). Table 3 records the standard deviation of log wages among cells
within the sectors. Taking the low pay industries, the average (unweighted) standard deviation of log
wages among cells within industry is about 0.4 in the US compared to 0.3 in Germany for the fifteen
lowest paying industries ranked by US wages. The main differences in the within-industry
differentials occur at the higher end of the low-paying industries rather than at the low end.
The similarity in the difference in pay by industry in the US and Germany also seems in conflict with
the fact that the distribution of wages by occupation is wider in the US than in Germany
(Freeman/Schettkat, 1998). The explanation that reconciles similarity in the distribution of wages
among industries and differences in the distribution of wages among occupations is partly arithmetic.
Consider pay in an industry that employs two types of workers, high wage and low-wage workers. In
the country with the wider skill structure for wages (the US) let high paid workers receive 1.50 while
the low paid workers receive .50. Then an industry that employs high and low-wage workers in
equal proportions will pay 1.00 on average. Compare this to the pay in a country (Germany) where
high skill occupations are paid 1.10 and low skill occupations are paid .90. Here, too the industry
average pay will be 1.00. More broadly, by mixing high and low paid workers, a country with a
highly unequal skill structure can produce the same industrial wage structure as a country with a
more narrow distribution of wages overall.

7
3. Occupations in low wage services
Do low wage services in the US and Germany use the same types of workers (as in the preceding
example) or does their employment composition differ in response to differences in the skill
structure of pay or relative supplies of workers with different skill attributes?
Labor demand analysis suggests that faced with differences in relative wages, the same industry
should employ different skill mixes of workers. The industry in the high skill premium country
should economize on skilled workers and hire disproportionately more less skilled workers than the
industry in the low skill premium country. This would reduce average pay in the industry in the
high skill premium country, though it would not necessarily lower pay relative to other industries,
which would face a similar incentive to substitute less skilled for more skilled workers. In any case,
substitution in response to differences in the structure of pay across skill groups should produce
differences in the composition of workers in low paid services in Germany rather than in the US.
Table 4 presents evidence that suggests considerable substitution of workers within sectors. It
records the proportions of workers working in low-paying occupations and high wage occupations
and the proportions with the characteristics (age, sex, education, and occupation) that would make
them high or low paid. Consistent with substitution, German low paying services have
proportionately more high wage workers defined by occupation or detailed characteristics than
American low paying services. For example in the large eating, drinking, and care facilities
category, 40 percent of Germans compared to 33 percent of Americans are in high-paying
occupations, and 50 percent of Germans compared to 28 percent of Americans are in high paying
cells.
4. Low-wage workers vs low-wage services
To what extent are low wage workers concentrated in low wage service industries or in particular
low wage service type occupations rather than being dispersed throughout the economy? How

8
important are low wage services in the employment of low-wage workers in the US and Germany?
Defining low pay as wages below two-thirds of the mean wage, about 15% of workers in the CGAS
are in cells with a wage below two-thirds of the German mean wage (below median wage: 15%) in
Germany. In the US the proportion with wages below 2/3rds the mean is about 30% (while those
with wages 2/3rds below the median is 24%)1. The share of low-wage workers is thus twice as high
in the US than in Germany.
Who are these workers, and where do they work?

Table 5 presents information on their

demographic characteristics and their concentration among sectors. The most striking difference in
demography is that women workers are more highly represented among low wage employees in
Germany than in the US. Given male-female wage gaps, this may help explain why relative wages in
low-pay services are further below the average wage in Germany compared to the US.
To examine the concentration of employment of low wage workers among sectors we calculated
Herfindahl indices by industry and occupation. A larger Herfindahl implies a greater concentration
of employment in a limited number of sectors. The Herfindahls in table 5 show a striking difference
between Germany and the US in the concentration of low wage workers by industry and occupation.
In the US low wage workers are widely distributed across the economy. In Germany low wage
workers are highly concentrated in low pay industries and occupations. Fully 70 percent of low wage
workers work in the fifteen lowest paying industries. This contrasts to fifty-eight percent of low
These shares are bit higher if one computes the share of German workers who are below
two-thirds of the US mean wage. Using OECD-PPPs for 1989 (1 PPP US $ = 2.104 DM) we find
19% of German workers below the two-third limit.

9
wage workers in the US employed in the fifteen lowest paying industries. The situation with respect
to occupations is even more striking: 37 percent of low wage Americans work in the fifteen lowest
paying occupations whereas 63 percent of low wage Germans work in the fifteen lowest paying
occupations.
Table 6 displays the industries and occupations that have shares of low-wage workers above the
economies average. By themselves, the major low paying services – eating, drinking facilities; retail
trade food; retail trade nonfood, and personal services – account for over half of Germany’s low
wage workers, and for around 40 percent of US low wage workers. Nearly 30 percent of all low
wage German workers are in sales, which is nearly twice the contribution of sales to low wage work
in the US.
The underlying reason for these differences is the very different within-industry or withinoccupation dispersions of wages in the two countries. A wide within-sector dispersion of wages
translates into low wage workers throughout the economy while a narrow within-sector dispersion
translates into a concentration of low wage workers in low wage industries and occupations.
5. Skill and the low wage services
The analysis thus far has treated workers within the low wage sectors in Germany and the US as
comparably skilled. A worker in an eating or drinking facility in Germany is similar to one in the
US. While this is a defensible proposition for at least some activities -- the hamburger flipper does
pretty much the same task in a German McDonald’s as in an American McDonald’s -- it is also a
proposition that is probably wrong for other activities. The bottom tail of Germans on educational
tests is invariably closer to the German mean than the bottom tail of Americans is to the American
mean, and the German mean score on tests usually exceeds the American mean.2 This suggests that

one important reason why the US has a higher share of low-wage workers within services and a
higher share of low wage service employment per adult in the population may simply be that the US
has more less skilled workers.
Comparing skills across countries is difficult. The standard measure of skills are inputs like years of
schooling or the highest degree achieved, which differ depending on the institutional features of
educational systems. In addition if the quality of education differs, even well-chosen comparisons of
educational levels may be misleading. The fact that the US educational system is based at a local
level, with relatively little national or even state control, implies moreover that to a greater extent
than in most countries, a year of schooling has different meaning within the country.
Still, difficulties notwithstanding, we want to assess the extent to which US-German differences in
low wage employment can be attributed to differences in the distribution of skills between the
countries. In the following analysis we use two different classifications of skill: one that we have
derived that seeks to transform German and US schooling levels into comparable measures on the
CGAS; and one based on Green-Steedman, who have developed another such comparison (see table
7).
We begin with years of schooling as derived from the national data sets. Then we develop a
comparable classification scheme, which accounts for differences in skill levels attached to years.
We distinguish four levels, in which to classify workers into equivalent skill groups. Hillary
Steedman and Andy Green developed a somewhat different classification scheme, based on 'detailed
scrutiny of syllabuses, examination papers and assessment procedures' (Green/ Steedman, 1997, 2)
that provides
a useful alternative to ours. Green and Steedman correct for the difference in actual skill levels by

11
shifting the German scale up across the entire skill levels. i.e., the German educational system is
estimated to produce higher skill levels in general. Our classification scheme shifts the German scale
up only at the lower end of the schedule.3 We do not regard years of schooling in Germany at the
higher levels to be superior to the American schooling. Since this paper focuses on the lower end of
the scale, the two systems of contrasting education should yield roughly comparable results in terms
of explaining differences in employment.
Table 8 shows the share of employment in the four levels of education by the two categorizations.
For the lowest level the two systems give comparable employment and log wages.

Our

categorization puts more US workers in the second and third lowest levels and fewer in the highest
level than does Green/Steedman. For Germany our scheme gives more weight to the second level
and much less to the third and fourth level whereas in the Green-Steedman scheme level three covers
almost 60% of the workforce and level four constitutes 25% of the workforce. Our top group are
masters’ and above whereas their top group consists of all bachelors’ degrees and above, on the US
schooling. If one takes the standard deviation of log wages as a measure for the quality of the
classification schemes – the lower the standard deviation for wages within a grouping the better the
grouping – there is no difference between the two schemes for the US but our scheme produces
substantially lower standard deviations for Germany.
Whether the skill distribution is based on the Green-Steedman or on our classification does not make
a difference in the US. The fifteen lowest paying industries in the US are also low-skill industries. In
many industries about 80% of all workers are in the lowest skill level. For Germany, however, the
distribution differs strongly between the Green-Steedman and our skill classification. In general, skill
level 1 has a much lower share in Germany than in the US and our classification puts a high share on
skill level II. According to skill classification the low-paying industries would be low skill in the
sense that the lion share of workers in these industries is in skill level II or below. Using the GreenSteedman classification however, would make these industries high skill, which we feel is probably

3 This may be justified by the fact that in the International Adult Literacy Survey (OECD 1997) among the low
educated adults (not completed upper secondary education) about 50% scored at level 3 and 4/5 on the document
reading scale but only about 18% of the Americans.

inappropriate.

6. Conclusion: Wages or Wedges or What?
This paper has documented that Germany does indeed have fewer workers in low wage service
industries than the US and that this difference is closely linked to Germany’s overall lower
employment to population rate compared to the US.
There are four possible reasons why Germany has fewer workers in the low wage service sector.
The first is that the cost of labour in Germany for those sectors is sufficiently high as to produce high
prices that discourages consumer purchases. This paper finds little evidence in support of this
proposition in terms of wages. Still, the fact that our data relate to the hourly wage ‘normally paid’
leaves open the possibility that non-wage costs or charges may contribute to lower service sector
employment. Labour costs include paid vacation time, which adds additional costs of 4% in the US
and about 12% in Germany. This difference would eliminate the lower relative wages found in
several low wage services in Germany in Table 3. Social security contributions are an additional
7.5% of employer costs in the US but 20% in Germany. If we assume that the incidence falls largely
on employers and consumers, this would create a sizeable labour cost gap, but the higher labour costs
would be found in all industries in Germany. Any impact on demand for low wage services would
require that low wage services have higher labor shares in gross output (so that the same change in
cost would produce a greater change in prices) than other sectors and/or higher elasticities of demand
for the product. There are a lot of dubious assumptions for this explanation to fly.
The second explanation is that high social assistance payments reduce the supply of workers to low
wage industries in Germany. In Germany, workers have to pay social security contributions and
income taxes, which reduces their take-home pay to about 64% in Germany, compared to about 76%
of gross earnings in the US. But the fact that Americans purchase their health care at the workplace
or at home and must buy other services which taxes pay for in Germany would reduce this

13
differential. In any case, our analysis of the German benefit structure (Freeman and Schettkat, table
9) suggests that this is an improbable explanation as well.
The third explanation is that Germany’s work force is too skilled for low wage service jobs. The
evidence that Germany uses more skilled occupations and workers in low wage services than the US
raises doubts about this explanation, though we have not finished our analysis of this issue.
The fourth explanation is a more subtle one, regarding the interrelation between other aspects of the
German economy and life-style and demand for low wage services. Germans work shorter hours and
they may substitute service consumption by 'do-it-yourself'. This reasoning would fit the desire of
Germans to work less and Americans to work more (Bell/ Freeman 1996). For it to stand up,
however, we would need time use data showing that low wage services are purchased
disproportionately by workers who put in many hours and that the specific services bought in the
market in the US are in fact produced in the home in Germany.
