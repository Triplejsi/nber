Foundations of Technical Analysis: Computational Algorithms, Statistical Inference,
and Empirical Implementation

NBER Working Paper No. 7613
March 2000

ABSTRACT
Technical analysis, also known as "charting," has been part of financial practice for many
decades, but this discipline has not received the same level of academic scrutiny and acceptance as

more traditional approaches such as fundamental analysis. One of the main obstacles is the highly
subjective nature of technical analysis—the presence of geometric shapes in historical !price charts is

often in the eyes of the beholder. In this paper, we propose a systematic and automatic approach to
technical pattern recognition using nonparametric kernel regression, and apply this method to a large

number of U.S. stocks from 1962 to 1996 to evaluate the effectiveness to technical analysis. By

comparing the unconditional empirical distribution of daily stock returns to the conditional
distribution—conditioned on specific technical indicators such as head-and-shoulders or double-

bottoms—we find that over the 31-year sample period, several technical indicators do provide
incremental information and may have some practical value.

One of the greatest gulfs between academic finance and industry practice is the separation

that exists between technical analysts and their academic critics. In contrast to fundamental
analysis, which was quick to be adopted by the scholars of modern quantitative finance, tech-

nical analysis has been an orphan from the very start. It has been argued that the difference

between fundamental analysis and technical analysis is not unlike the difference between
astronomy and astrology. Among some circles, technical analysis is known as "voodoo fi-

nance." And in his influential book A Random Walk Down Wall Street, Burton Maildel
(1996) concludes that "[ujnder scientific scrutiny, chart-reading must share a pedestal with
alchemy."

However, several academic studies suggest that despite its jargon and methods, technical
analysis may well be an effective means for extracting useful information from market prices.

For example, in rejecting the Random Walk Hypothesis for weekly US stock indexes, Lo and
MacKinlay (1988, 1999) have shown that past prices may be used to forecast future returns to

some degree, a fact that all technical analysts take for granted. Studies by Tabell and Tabell

(1964), Treynor and Ferguson (1985), Brown and Jennings (1989), Jegadeesh and Titman
(1993), Blume, Easley, and O'Hara (1994), Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok (1996), Lo and

MacKinlay (1997), Grundy and Martin (1998), and Rouwenhorst (1998) have also provided

indirect support for technical analysis, and more direct support has been given by Pruitt
and White (1988), Neftci (1991), Broth, Lakonishok, and LeBaron (1992), Neely, Weber,

and Dittmar (1997), Neely and Weller (1998), Chang and Osler (1994), Osler and Chang
(1995), and Allen and Karjalainen (1999).

One explanation for this state of controversy and confusion is the unique and sometimes
impenetrable jargon used by technical analysts, some of which has developed into a standard

lexicon that can be translated. But there are many "homegrown" variations, each with its
own patois, which can often frustrate the uninitiated. Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997,
pp. 43—44) provide a striking example of the linguistic barriers between technical analysts
and academic finance by contrasting this statement:

The presence of clearly identified support and resistance levels, coupled with
a one-third retracement parameter when prices lie between them, suggests the
1

presence of strong buying and selling opportunities in the near-term.

with this one:

The magnitudes and decay pattern of the first twelve autocorrelations and the

statistical significance of the Box-Pierce Q-statistic suggest the presence of a
high-frequency predictable component in stock returns.

Despite the fact that both statements have the same meaning—that past prices contain
information for predicting future returns-—-most readers find one statement plausible and
the other puzzling, or worse, offensive.

These linguistic barriers underscore an important difference between technical analysis
and quantitative finance: technical analysis is primarily visual, while quantitative finance is
primarily algebraic and numerical. Therefore, technical analysis employs the tools of geom-

etry and pattern recognition, while quantitative finance employs the tools of mathematical
analysis and probability and statistics. In the wake of recent breakthroughs in financial engineering, computer technology, and numerical algorithms, it is no wonder that quantitative
finance has overtaken technical analysis in popularity—the principles of portfolio optimiza-

tion are far easier to program into a computer than the basic tenets of technical analysis.
Nevertheless, technical analysis has survived through the years, perhaps because its visual
mode of analysis is more conducive to human cognition, and because pattern recognition is

one of the few repetitive activities for which computers do not have an absolute advantage
(yet).
Indeed, it is difficult to dispute the potential value of price/volume charts when confronted

with the visual evidence. For example, compare the two hypothetical price charts given in
Figure 1. Despite the fact that the two price series are identical over the first half of the
sample, the volume patterns differ, and this seems to be informative. In particular, the lower

chart, which shows high volume accompanying a positive price trend, suggests that there
may be more information content in the trend, e.g., broader participation among investors.

The fact that the joint distribution of prices and volume contains important information is
hardly controversial among academics. Why, then, is the value of a visual depiction of that

joint distribution so hotly contested?
2

In this paper, we hope to bridge this gulf between technical analysis and quantitative
finance by developing a systematic aiid scientific approach to the practice of technical analysis, and by employing the now-standard methods of empirical analysis to gauge the efficacy

of technical indicators over time and across securities. In doing so, our goal is not only to
develop a lingua franca with which disciples of both disciplines can engage in productive
dialogue, but also to extend the reach of technical analysis by augmenting its tool kit with
some modem techniques in pattern recognition.
The general goal of technical analysis is to identify regularities in the time series of prices

by extracting nonlinear patterns from noisy data. Implicit in this goal is the recognition
that some price movements are significant—they contribute to the formation of a specific

pattern—and others are merely random fluctuations to be ignored. In many cases, the
human eye can perform this "signal extraction" quickly and accurately, and until recently,
computer algorithms could not. However, a class of statistical estimators, called smoothing

estimators, is ideally suited to this task because they extract nonlinear relations the) by
"averaging out" the noise. Therefore, we propose using these estimators to mimic, and in
some cases, sharpen the skills of a trained tec]mical analyst in identifying certain patterns
in historical price series.

In Section I, we provide a brief review of smoothing estimators and describe in detail the

specific smoothing estimator we use in our analysis: kernel regression. Our algorithm for
automating technical analysis is described in Section II. We apply this algorithm to the daily

returns of several hundred U.S. stocks from 1962 to 1996 and report the results in Section

III. To check the accuracy of our statistical inferences, we perform several Monte Carlo
simulation experiments and the results are given in Section IV. We conclude in Section V.

I. Smoothing Estimators and Kernel Regression
The starting point for any study of technical analysis is the recognition that prices evolve

in a nonlinear fashion over time and that the nonlinearities contain certain regularities or
patterns. To capture such regularities quantitatively, we begin by asserting that prices {P}

3

satisfy the following expression:

Pt =

m(Xt)

+ c , t=1,...,T

(1)

where m(X) is an arbitrary fixed but unknown nonlinear function of a state variable X,
and {e} is white noise.
For the purposes of pattern recognition in which our goal is to construct a smooth function

nze) to approximate the time series of prices {pt}, we set the state variable equal to time,
X = t. However, to keep our notation consistent with that of the kernel regression literature,

we will continue to use X, in our exposition.
When prices are expressed as (1), it is apparent that geometric patterns can emerge from

a visual inspection of historical prices series—prices are the sum of the nonlinear pattern
im(Xt) and white noise—and that such patterns may provide useful information about the
unknown function me) to be estimated. But just how useful is this information?
To answer this question empirically and systematically, we must first develop a method

for automating the identification of technical indicators, i.e., we require a pattern recogni
tion algorithm. Once such an algorithm is developed, it can be applied to a large number of
securities over many time periods to determine the efficacy of various technical indicators.

Moreover, quantitative comparisons of the performance of several indicators can be conducted, and the statistical significance of such performance can be assessed through Monte

Carlo simulation and bootstrap techniques.'

In Section A, we provide a brief review of a general class of pattern-recognition techniques known as smoothing, and in Section B we describe in some detail a particular method

called nonparametric kernel regression on which our algorithm is based. Kernel regression

estimators are calibrated by a bandwidth parameter and we discuss how the bandwidth is
selected in C.

A. Smoothing Estimators
One of the most common methods for estimating nonlinear relations such as (1) is smoothing,

in which observational errors are reduced by averaging the data in sophisticated ways. Ker4

nel regression, orthogonal series expansion, projection pursuit, nearest-neighbor estimators,

average derivative estimators, splines, and neural networks are all examples of smoothing

estimators. In addition to possessing certain statistical optirnality properties, smoothing
estimators are motivated by their close correspondence to the way human cognition extracts
regularities from noisy data.2 Therefore, they are ideal for our purposes.

To provide some intuition for how averaging can recover nonlinear relations such as

the function me) in (1), suppose we wish to estimate mC) at a particWar date to when
X0=x0. Now suppose that for this one observation, X0, we can obtain repeated independent

= Pi,-• . ,

observations of the price P,0, say

= p, (note that these are ii independent

realizations of the price at the same date to, clearly an impossibility in practice, but let us

continue with this thought experiment for a few more steps). Then a natural estimator of
the function mC) at the point zo is

ñt(xo) =

=

1pi
ni=1
m(xo)

= 1[m(xo)+efl

+ —Ed,

(2)

(3)

and by the Law of Large Numbers, the second term in (3) becomes negligible for large ii.

Of course, if {P} is a time series, we do not have the luxury of repeated observations
for a given X,. However, if we assume that the function mC) is sufficiently smooth, then
for time-series observations X near the value x0, the corresponding values of P should be
close to m(xo). In other words, if mC) is sufficiently smooth, then in a small neighborhood
around x0, m(xo) will be nearly constant and may be estimated by taking an average of the
Pr's that correspond to those Xe's near x0. The closer the Xi's are to the value x0, the closer
an average of corresponding Pt's will be to m(xo). This argues for a weighted average of the

Pt's, where the weights decline as the X,'s get farther away from x0. This weighted-average
or "local averaging" procedure of estimating m(x) is the essence of smoothing.

More formally, for any arbitrary x, a smoothing estimator of m(x) may be expressed as
rui(x)

lT

w(z)Pt
t= 1

5

(4)

where the weights {wt(x)} are large for those Ps's paired with Xe's near x, and small for those

Pr's with Xe's far from x. To implement such a procedure, we must define what we mean by

"near" and "far." If we choose too large a neighborhood around x to compute the average,
the weighted average will be too smooth and will not exhibit the genuine nonlinearities of

mC). If we choose too small a neighborhood around x, the weighted average will be too
variable, reflecting noise as well as the variations in mC). Therefore, the weights {wt(x)}
must be chosen carefully to balance these two considerations.

B. Kernel Regression
For the kernel regression estimator, the weight function Wt(x) is constructed from a probability density function K(x), also called a kernel:3

K(x) 0

,

fK(n)d'u=

1.

(5)

By rescaling the kernel with respect to a parameter h>0, we can change its spread, i.e., let:
Kh(u)

K(u/h) ,

fKh(u)du

=

1

(6)

and define the weight function to be used in the weighted average (4) as
— Xt)/gh(x)

wt,h(x)

gh(x)

fLKh(x—Xt).

(7)
(8)

If h is very small, the averaging will be done with respect to a rather small neighborhood
around each of the Xe's. If h is very large, the averaging will be over larger neighborhoods of

the Xe's. Therefore, controlling the degree of averaging amounts to adjusting the smoothing

parameter Ii, also known as the bandwidth. Choosing the appropriate bandwidth is an
important aspect of any local-averaging technique and is discussed more fully in Section C.

6

Substituting (8) into (4) yields the Nadaraya- Watson kernel estimator 'thh(x) of m(x):

1 '"
Kh(x — X)Y
mnh(x) = —EWt,h(X)Yt = >i::1
T
T
E=1 Khfr — X)

(9)

Under certain regularity conditions on the shape of the kernel K and the magnitudes and

behavior of the weights as the sample size grows, it may be shown, that ñth(x) converges to
ni(x) asymptotically in several ways (see Hãrdlle (1990) for further details). This convergence

property holds for a wide class of kernels, but for the remainder of this paper we shall use
the most popular choice of kernel, the Gaussian kernel:

Kh(x) =

(10)

C. Selecting the Bandwidth
Selecting the appropriate bandwidth h in (9) is clearly central to the success of ñzhC) in
approximating mO—too little averaging yields a function that is too choppy, and too much

averaging yields a function that is too smooth. To illustrate these two extremes, Figure II
displays the Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator applied to 500 datapoints generated from
the relation:

= Sin(Xt) + 0.5 c , c 'S-' N(0, 1)

(11)

where X is evenly spaced in the interval [0, 2ir]. Panel 11(a) plots the raw data and the
function to be approximated.
Kernel estimators for three different bandwidths are plotted as solid lines in Panels 11(b)—

(c). The bandwidth in 11(b) is clearly too small; the function is too variable, fitting the
"noise" 0.5 t as well as the "signal" Sin(S). Increasing the bandwidth slightly yields a much
more accurate approximation to Sine) as Panel 11(c) illustrates. However, Panel 11(d) shows

that if the bandwidth is increased beyond some point, there is too much averaging and
information is lost.

There are several methods for automating the choice of bandwidth h in (9), but the most

7

popular is the cross-validation method in which h is chosen to minimize the cross-validation
function:

CV(h) =

(P

- rnh,t)2

(12)

where

Tflh,t

= >W,hYr

(13)

The estimator iuih,t is the kernel regression estimator applied to the price history {P,-} with

the t-th observation omitted, and the summands in (12) are the squared errors of the ihh,t's,

each evaluated at the omitted observation. For a given bandwidth parameter It, the crossvalidation function is a measure of the ability of the kernel regression estimator to fit each

observation P when that observation is not used to construct the kernel estimator. By
selecting the bandwidth that minimizes this function, we obtain a kernel estimator that
satisfies certain optimality properties, e.g., minimum asymptotic mean-squared error.4
Interestingly, the bandwidths obtained from minimizing the cross-validation function are

generally too large for our application to technical analysis—when we presented several
professional technical analysts with plots of cross-validation-fitted functions ni4e), they all

concluded that the fitted functions were too smooth. In other words, the cross-validationdetermined bandwidth places too much weight on prices far away from any given time t,
inducing too much averaging and discarding valuable information in local price movements.

Through trial and error, and by polling professional technical analysts, we have found that
an acceptable solutioft to this problem is to use a bandwidth of 0.3 x h*, where h minimizes

CV(h).5 Admittedly, this is an ad hoc approach, and it remains an important challenge for
future research to develop a more rigorous procedure.

Another promising direction for future research is to consider alternatives to kernel re-

gression. Although useful for its simplicity and intuitive appeal, kernel estimators suffer
from a number of well-known deficiencies, e.g., boundary bias, lack of local variability in

the degree of smoothing, etc. A popular alternative that overcomes these particular defi8

ciencies is local polynomial regression in which local averaging of polynomials is performed

to obtain an estimator of tm(x) 6 Such alternatives may yield important improvements the
pattern-recognition algorithm described in Section II.

TI. Automating Technical Analysis
Armed with a mathematical representation the) of {P} with which geometric properties can
be characterized in an objective manner, we can now construct an algorithm for automating
the detection of technical patterns. Specifically, our algorithm contains three steps:

1. Define each technical pattern in terms of its geometric properties, e.g., local extrema
(maxima and minima).

2. Construct a kernel estimator thC) of a given time series of prices so that its extrema
can be determined numerically.

3. Analyze the) for occurrences of each technical pattern.
The last two steps are rather straightforward applications of kernel regression. The. first step

is likely to be the most controversial because it is here that the skills and judgment of a
professional technical analyst come into play. Although we will argue in Section A that most

technical indicators can be characterized by specific sequences of local extrema, technical
analysts may argue that these are poor approximations to the kinds of patterns that trained
human analysts can identify.

While pattern-recognition techniques have been successful in automating a number of

tasks previously considered to be uniquely human endeavors—fingerprint identification,
handwriting analysis, face recognition, and so on—nevertheless it is possible that no algorithm can completely capture the skills of an experienced technical analyst. We acknowledge

that any automated procedure for pattern recognition may miss some of the more subtle nu-

ances that human cognition is capable of discerning, but whether an algorithm is a poor
approximation to human judgment can only be determined by investigating the approximation errors empirically. As long as an algorithm can provide a reasonable approximation to

9

some of the cognitive abilities of a human analyst, we can use such an algorithm to investi-

gate the empirical performance of those aspects of technical analysis for which the algorithm

is a good approximation. Moreover, if technical analysis is an art form that can be taught,

then surely its basic precepts can be quantified and automated to some degree. And as
increasingly sophisticated pattern-recognition techniques are developed, a larger fraction of
the art will become a science.
More importantly, from a practical perspective, there may be significant benefits to devel-

oping an algorithmic approach to technical analysis because of the leverage that technology

can provide. As with many other successful technologies, the automation of technical pat-

tern recognition may not replace the skills of a technical analyst, but can amplify them
considerably.

In Section A, we propose definitions of ten technical patterns based on their extrema. In
Section B, we describe a specific algorithm to identify technical patterns based on the local

extrema of kernel regression estimators, and provide specific examples of the algorithm at
work in Section C.

A. Definitions of Technical Patterns
We focus on five pairs of technical patterns that are among the most popular patterns of
traditional technical analysis (see, for example, Edwards and Magee (1966, Chapters VII—
X)): head-and-shoulders (HS) and inverse head-and-shoulders (IRS), broadening tops (BT)

and bottoms (BB), triangle tops (TT) and bottoms (TB), rectangle tops (RT) and bottoms
(RB), and double tops (DT) and bottoms (DB). There are many other technical indicators
that may be easier to detect algorithmically—moving averages, support and resistance levels,

and oscillators, for example—but because we wish to illustrate the power of smoothing
techniques in automating technical analysis, we focus on precisely those patterns that are
most difficult to quantify analytically.
Consider the systematic component me) of a price history {P} and suppose we have identified ii local extrema, i.e., the local maxima and minima, of tm{';). Denote by E1, E2,. . . ,
the ii extrema

and t, t,. . . , t the dates on which these extrema occur. Then we have the

following definitions:
10

Definition 1 (Head-and-Shoulders)

Head-and-shoulders (HS) and inverted head-andshoulders (IHS) patterns are characterized by a sequence of five consecutive local extrema
E1,. . , P25 such that:
a maximum

IfS =—

E1 and P25 within 1.5percent of their average

P22 and P24 within 1.5percent of their average
P21 a minimum

IHS =
—

F1 and F5 within 1.5percent of their average

F2 and F4 within l.5percent of their average
Observe that only five consecutive extrema are required to identify a head-and-shoulders
pattern. This follows from the formalization of the geometry of a head-and-shoulders pattern:

three peaks, with the midifie peak higher than the other two. Because consecutive extrema
must alternate between maxima and minima for smooth functions,7 the three-peaks pattern

corresponds to a sequence of five local extrema: maximum, minimum, highest maximum,
minimum, and maximum. The inverse head-and-shoulders is simply the mirror image of the

head-and-shoulders, with the initial local extrema a minimum.
Because broadening, rectangle, and triangle patterns can begin on either a local maximum

or minimum, we aUow for both of these possibilities in our definitions by distinguishing
between broadening tops and bottoms:

Definition 2 (Broadening) Broadening tops (BTOP) and bottoms (EBOT) are characterized by a sequence of five consecutive local extrema F1,.. . , F5 such that:

a maximum

BTOP P21<E3<E5

BBOT

,

I F1 a minimum

1E2<P24
Definitions for triangle and rectangle patterns follow naturally:

Definition 3 (Triangle) Triangle tops (TTOF) and bottoms (TBOT) are characterized by
a sequence of five consecutive local extrema Er,.. . ,E5 such that:
TTOP=—

(F1 a minimum

I E1 a maximum

TBOT=

,

IE2>E4

L.E2<P24
11

Definitign 4 (Rectangle) Rectangle tops (RTOP) and bottoms (RBOT) are characterized
by a sequence of five consecutive local extrema E1,. . . , E5 such that:

RTOP —
=

a maximum
tops within 0. 75 percent of their average
bottoms within 0.75 percent of their average
lowest top> highest bottom

RBOT —
=

a minimum
tops within 0.75 percent of their average
bottoms within 0.75 percent of their average
lowest top > highest bottom

The definition for double tops and bottoms is slightly more involved. Consider first the

double top. Starting at a local maximum E1, we locate the highest local maximum Ea
occurring after E1 in the set of all local extrema in the sample. We require that the two

tops, E1 and E,

be

within 1.5 percent of their average. Finally, following Edwards and

Magee (1966), we require that the two tops occur at least a month, or 22 trading days,
apart. Therefore, we have:

Definition 5 (Double Top and Bottom) Double tops (DTOP) and bottoms (DBO T) are
characterized by an initial local extremum E1 and a subsequent local extrema E and Eb such

that:

sup{Pç : t>t, k=2,...,n}

B. The Identification Algorithm
Our algorithm begins with a sample of prices {P1,.

one for each subsample or

window

..

Pr} for which we fit kernel regressions,

from t to t+l+d—1, where t varies from 1 to T—l—d+1,
12

and I and d are fixed parameters whose purpose is explained below. In the empirical analysis

of Section III, we set I = 35 and d = 3, hence each window consists of 38 trading days.
The motivation for fitting kernel regressions to rolling windows of data is to narrow our

focus to patterns that are completed within the span of the window—i + d trading days in
our case. If we fit a single kernel regression to the entire dataset, many patterns of various
durations may emerge, and without imposing some additional structure on the nature of the

patterns, it is virtually impossible to distinguish signal from noise in this case. Therefore,
our algorithm fixes the length of the window at I+d, but kernel regressions are estimated on
a rolling basis and we search for patterns in each window.
Of course, for any fixed window, we can only find patterns that are completed within l+d

trading days. Without further structure on the systematic component of prices me), this is
a restriction that any empirical analysis must contend with.8 We choose a shorter window
length of 1 = 35 trading days to focus on short-horizon patterns that may be more relevant
for active equity traders, and leave the analysis of longer-horizon patterns to future research.

The parameter d controls for the fact that in practice we do not observe a realization of

a given pattern as soon as it has completed. Instead, we assume that there may be a lag
between the pattern completion and the time of pattern detection. To account for this lag,
we require that the final extremum that completes a pattern occurs on day t+l—1; hence d is

the number of days following the completion of a pattern that must pass before the pattern

is detected. This will become more important in Section III when we compute conditional

returns, conditioned on the realization of each pattern. In particular, we compute postpattern returns starting from the end of trading day t+l+d, i.e., one day after the pattern
has completed. For example, if we determine that a head-and-shoulder pattern has completed
on day t + 1— 1 (having used prices from time t through time t + 1 + d —1), we compute the

conditional one-day gross return as

Yt+l+d+1/Yt÷l+d. Hence we do not use any forward

information in computing returns conditional on pattern completion. In other words, the
lag d ensures that we are computing our conditional returns completely out-of-sample and
without any "look-ahead" bias.

Within each window, we estimate a kernel regression using the prices in that window,

where Kh(z) is given in (10) and h is the bandwidth parameter (see Section C). It is clear

that ñih(r) is a differentiable function of r.
Once the function ñ'ih(r) has been computed, its local extrema can be readily identified

by finding times r such that Sgn(ñz(r)) = —Sgn(n4(r+1)), where ñz denotes the derivative
of flih with respect to r and Sgn(.) is the signum function. If the signs of ñ%(r) ñt(r+1) are
+1 and —1, respectively, then we have found a local maximum, and if they are —1 and +1,

respectively, then we have found a local minimum. Once such a time r has been identified,
we proceed to identify a maximum or minimum in the original price series {P} in the range

[t—i, t+iJ, and the extrema in the original price series are used to determine whether or not
a pattern has occurred according to the definitions of Section A.

If th(r) =

0

for a given i-, which occurs if closing prices stay the same for several

consecutive days, we need to check whether the price we have found is a local minimum or

maximum. We look for the date s such that s = inf { s >

r : ñz(s) $ 0 }.

We then

apply the same method as discussed above, except here we compare Sgn(i%(r — 1)) and
Sgn(u14(s)).

One useful consequence of this algorithm is that the series of extrema which it identifies

contains alternating minima and maxima. That is, if the kth extremum is a maximum, then

it is always the case that the (k+l)th extremum is a minimum, and vice versa.
An important advantage of using this kernel regression approach to identify patterns is
the fact that it ignores extrema that are "too local." For example, a simpler alternative is

to identify local extrema from the raw price data directly, i.e., identify a price P as a local

maximum if P,1 C Pt and P, > P+1, and vice versa for a local minimum. The problem
with this approach is that it identifies too many extrema, and also yields patterns that are
not visually consistent with the kind of patterns that technical analysts find compelling.
Once we have identified all of the local extrema in the window [t, t + I + d — 1], we can

proceed to check for the presence of the various technical patterns using the definitions of
14

Section A. This procedure is then repeated for the next window [t+i, t+l+d] , and continues
until the end of the sample is reached at the window [T —i —d+ 1, T].

C. Empirical Examples
To see how our algorithm performs in practice, we apply it to the daily returns of a single
security, CTX, during the five-year period from 1992 to 1996. Figures 111—Vu plot occurrences of the five pairs of patterns defined in Section A that were identified by our algorithm.

Note that there were no rectangle bottoms detected for CTX during this period, so for completeness we substituted a rectangle bottom for CDO stock which occurred during the same

period.
In each of these graphs, the solid lines are the raw prices, the dashed lines are the kernel

estimators mh(•), the circles indicate the local extrema, and the vertical line marks date
t+l —1, the day that the final extremum occurs to complete the pattern.
Casual inspection by several professional technical analysts seems to confirm the ability of

our automated procedure to match human judgment in identifying the five pairs of patterns
in Section A. Of course, this is merely anecdotal evidence and not meant to be conclusive—

we provide these• figures simply to illustrate the output of a technical pattern recognition
algorithm based on kernel regression.

III. Is Technical Analysis Informative?
Although there have been many tests of technical analysis over the years, most of these tests

have focused on the profitability of technical trading rules.9 While some of these studies do

find that technical indicators can generate statistically significant trading profits, they beg
the question of whether or not such profits are merely the equilibrium rents that accrue to
investors willing to bear the risks associated with such strategies. Without specifying a fully

articulated dynamic general equilibrium asset-pricing model, it is impossible to determine
the economic source of trading profits.
Instead, we propose a more fundamental test in this section, one that attempts to gauge
the information content in the technical patterns of Section A by comparing the unconditional

15

empirical distribution of returns with the coriesponding conditional empirical distribution,

conditioned on the occurrence of a technical pattern. If technical patterns are informative,

conditioning on them should alter the empirical distribution of returns; if the information
contained in such patterns has already been incorporated into returns, the conditional and
unconditional distribution of returns should be close. Although this is a weaker test of the
effectiveness of technical analysis—informativeness does not guarantee a profitable trading

strategy—it is, nevertheless, a natural first step in a quantitative assessment of technical
analysis.

To measure the distance between the two distributions, we propose two goodness-of-fit
measures in Section A. We apply these diagnostics to the daily returns of individual stocks

from 1962 to 1996 using a procedure described in Sections B to D, and the results are
reported in Sections E and F.

A. Goodness-of-Fit Tests
A simple diagnostic to test the informativeness of the ten technical patterns is to compare the

quantiles of the conditional returns with their unconditional counterparts. If conditioning on
these technical patterns provides no incremental information, the quantiles of the conditional

returns should be similar to those of unconditional returns. In particular, we compute the
deciles of unconditional returns and tabulate the relative frequency 5 of conditional returns
falling into decile j of the unconditional returns,=j 1,. . ., 10:

number of conditional returns in decile
total number of conditional returns

15

Under the null hypothesis that the returns are independently and identically distributed and
the conditional and unconditional distributions are identical, the asymptotic distributions of

S and the corresponding goodness-of-fit test statistic Q are given by:
—0.10) Qi Af(0, 0.10(1—0.10))
Q

(nj_0J0n)2
16

(16)
(17)

where nj is the number of observations that fall in decile j and n is the total number of
observations (see, for example, DeGroot (1986)).

Another comparison of the conditional and unconditional distributions of returns is pro-

vided by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Denote by {Z1}1 and {Z2}1 two samples that
are each independently and identically distributed with cumulative distribution functions
Fi(z) and F2(z), respectively. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic is designed to test the null

hypothesis that F1 = F2, and is based on the empirical cumulative distribution functions N

of both samples:

i=1,2

k=i
where

(18)

1(.) is the indicator function. The statistic is given by the expression:

7m1,n2

=

(

n1n2
Ti1

+ n2 )1/2

sup

Ei(z)

—fr2(z)I

.

(19)

Under the null hypothesis F1 = F2, the statistic 'y,,22 should be small. Moreover, Smirnov

(1939a, 1939b) derives the limiting distribution of the statistic to be:
lim
mm(ni ,fl2)—*oC

Prob( 'y1,2 x) =k=—oo
E (_1)k exp(—2k2x2) , x> 0

(20)

An approximate a-level test of the null hypothesis can be performed by computing the
statistic and rejecting the null if it exceeds the upper lOOa-th percentile for the null distribution given by (20) (see Hollander and Wolfe (1973, Table A.23), Csáki (1984), and Press
et al. (1986, Chapter 13.5)).
Note that the sampling distributions of both the goodness-of-fit and Kolmogorov-Smirnov

statistics are derived under the assumption that returns are independently and identically

distributed, which is not plausible for financial data. We attempt to address this problem by normalizing the returns of each security, i.e., by subtracting its mean and dividing

by its standard deviation (see Section C), but this does not eliminate the dependence or
heterogeneity. We hope to extend our analysis to the more general non-lID case in future

17

research.

B. The Data and Sampling Procedure
We apply the goodness-of-fit and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to the daily returns of individual NYSE/AMEX and Nasdaq stocks from 1962 to 1996 using data from the Center for
Research in Securities Prices (CRSP). To ameliorate the effects of nonstationarities induced

by changing market structure and institutions, we split the data into NYSE/AMEX stocks
and Nasdaq stocks and into seven five-year periods: 1962 to 1966, 1967 to 1971, and so on.
To obtain a broad cross-section of securities, in each five-year subperiod, we randomly select
ten stocks from each of five market-capitalization quintiles (using mean market-capitalization

over the subperiod), with the further restriction that at least 75 percent of the price observations must be non-missing during the subperiod.'° This procedure yields a sample of 50
stocks for each subperiod across seven subperiods (note that we sample wjth replacement,
hence there may be names in common across subp eriods).
As a check on the robustness of our inferences, we perform this sampling procedure twice

to construct two samples, and apply our empirical analysis to both. Although we report
results only from the first sample to conserve space, the results of the second sample are
qualitatively consistent with the first and are available upon request.

C. Computing Conditional Returns
For each stock in each subperiod, we apply the procedure outlined in Section II to identify
all occurrences of the ten patterns deBited in Section A. For each pattern detected, we com-

pute the one-day continuously compounded return d days after the pattern has completed.

Specifically, consider a window of prices {P} from t to t+l +d— 1, and suppose that the
identified pattern p is completed at t + I — 1. Then we take the conditional return R' as

log(1 + R+1÷i). Therefore, for each stock, we have ten sets of such conditional returns,
each conditioned on one of the ten patterns of Section A.
For each stock, we construct a sample of unconditional continuously compounded returns

using non-overlapping intervals of length r, and we compare the empirical distribution func-

tion of these returns with those of the conditional returns. To facilitate such comparisons,
18

we standardize all returns—both conditional and unconditional—by subtracting means and
dividing by standard deviations, hence:
it

—
—

— Mean[Rt]

SD[Rj]

' 21

where the means and standard deviations are computed for each individual stock within each

subperiod. Therefore, by construction, each normalized return series has zero mean and unit
variance.

Finally, to increase the power of our goodness-of-fit tests, we combine the normalized returns of all 50 stocks within each subperiod; hence for each subperiod we have two samples—

unconditional and conditional returns—and from these we compute two empirical distribu-

tion functions that we compare using our diagnostic test statistics.

D. Conditioning on Volume
Given the prominent role that volume plays in technical analysis, we also construct returns
conditioned on increasing or decreasing volume. Specifically, for each stock in each subperiod,

we compute its average share-turnover during the first and second halves of each subperiod,

r1 and r2, respectively." If i-, > 1.2 x r2, we categorize this as a "decreasing volume" event;

if r2 >

1.2

x r1, we categorize this as an "increasing volume" event. If neither of these

conditions holds, then neither event is considered to have occurred.

Using these events, we can construct conditional returns conditioned on two pieces of
information: the occurrence of a technical pattern and the occurrence of increasing or decreasing volume. Therefore, we shall compare the empirical distribution of unconditional

returns with three conditional-return distributions: the distribution of returns conditioned
on technical patterns, the distribution conditioned on technical patterns and increasing volume, and the distribution conditioned on technical patterns and decreasing volume.

Of course, other conditioning variables can easily be incorporated into this procedure,
though the "curse of dimensionality" imposes certain practical limits on the ability to estimate multivariate conditional distributions nonparametrically.

19

E. Summary Statistics
In Tables I and II, we report frequency counts for the number of patterns detected over the
entire 1962 to 1996 sample, and within each subperiod and each market-capitalization quintile, for the ten patterns defined in Section A. Table I contains results for the NYSE/AMEX
stocks, and Table II contains corresponding results for Nasdaq stocks.

Table I shows that the most common patterns across all stocks and over the entire sam-

ple period are double tops and bottoms (see the row labelled "Entire"), with over 2,000
occurrences of each. The second most common patterns are the head-and-shoulders and
inverted head-and-shoulders, with over 1,600 occurrences of each. These total counts correspond roughly to four to six occurrences of each of these patterns for each stock during each

five-year subperiod (divide the total number of occurrences by 7 x 50), not an unreasonable
frequency from the point of view of professional technical analysts. Table I shows that most

of the ten patterns are more frequent for larger stocks than for smaller ones, and that they
are relatively evenly distributed over the five-year subperiods. When volume trend is con-

sidered jointly with the occurrences of the ten patterns, Table I shows that the frequency

of patterns is not evenly distributed between increasing (the row labelled "r(,)") and decreasing (the row labelled "r(N)") volume-trend cases. For example, for the entire sample
of stocks over the 1962 to 1996 sample period, there are 143 occurrences of a broadening
top with decreasing volume trend, but 409 occurrences of a broadening top with increasing
volume trend.
For purposes of comparison, Table I also reports frequency counts for the number of pat-

terns detected in a sample of simulated geometric Brownian motion, calibrated to match the
mean and standard deviation of each stock in each five-year subperiod.12 The entries in the
row labelled "Sim. GBM" show that the random walk model yields very different implications

for the frequency counts of several technical patterns. For example, the simulated sample
has only 577 head-and-shoulders and 578 inverted-head-and-shoulders patterns, whereas the

actual data have considerably more, 1,611 and 1,654, respectively. On the other hand, for
broadening tops and bottoms, the simulated sample contains many more occurrences than
the actual data, 1,227 and 1,028 as compared to 725 and 748, respectively. The number of

20

triangles is roughly comparable across the two samples, but for rectangles and double tops
and bottoms, the differences are dramatic. Of course, the simulated sample is only one realization of geometric Brownian motion, so it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the

relative frequencies. Nevertheless, these simulations point to important differences between

the data and independently and identically distributed lognormal returns.

To develop further intuition for these patterns, Figures VIII and IX display the crosssectional and time-series distribution of each of the ten patterns for the NYSE/AMEX and
Nasdaq samples, respectively. Each symbol represents a pattern detected by our algorithm,

the vertical axis is divided into five quintiles, the horizontal axis is calendar time, and
alternating symbols (diamonds and asterisks) represent distinct subperiods. These graphs
show that the distribution of patterns is not clustered in time or among a subset of securities.
Table II provides the same frequency counts for Nasdaq stocks, and despite the fact that
we have the same number of stocks in this sample (50 per subperiod over seven subperiods),

there are considerably fewer patterns detected than in the NYSE/AMEX case. For example,
the Nasdaq sample yields only 919 head-and-shoulders patterns, whereas the NYSE/AMEX

sample contains 1,611. Not surprisingly, the frequency counts for the sample of simulated
geometric Brownian motion are similar to those in Table I.
Tables III and IV report suumiary statistics—means, standard deviations, skewness, and
excess kurtosis—of unconditional and conditional normalized returns of NYSE/AMEX and
Nasdaq stocks, respectively. These statistics show considerable variation in the different re-

turn populations. For example, the first four moments of normalized raw returns are 0.000,
1.000,

0.345, and 8.122, respectively. The same four moments of post-BTOP returns are

—0.005, 1.035, —1.151, and 16.701, respectively, and those of post-DTOP returns are 0.017,

0.910, 0.206, and 3.386, respectively. The differences in these statistics among the ten con-

ditional return populations, and the differences between the conditional and unconditional
return populations, suggest that conditioning on the ten technical indicators does have some
effect on the distribution of returns.

21

F. Empirical Results
Tables V and Vi reports the results of the goodness-of-fit test (16)—(l7) for our sample of
NYSE and AMEX (Table V) and Nasdaq (Table VI) stocks, respectively, from 1962 to 1996

for each of the ten technical patterns. Table V shows that in the NYSE/AMEX sample,
the relative frequencies of the conditional returns are significantly different from those of the

unconditional returns for seven of the ten patterns considered. The three exceptions are the

conditional returns from the BBOT, TTOP, and DBOT patterns, for which the p-values of
the test statistics Qare 5.1 percent, 21.2 percent, and 16.6 percent respectively. These results

yield mixed support for the overall efficacy of technical indicators. However, the results of
Table VI tell a different story: there is overwhelming significance for all ten indicators in the

Nasdaq sample, with p-values that are zero to three significant digits, and test statistics Q

that range from 34.12 to 92.09. In contrast, the test statistics inTable V range from 12.03
to 50.97.

One possible explanation for the difference between the NYSE/AMEX and Nasdaq
samples is a difference in the power of the test because of different sample sizes. If the
NYSE/AMEX sample contained fewer conditional returns, i.e., fewer patterns, the corre-

sponding test statistics might be subject to greater sampling variation and lower power.
However, this explanation can be ruled out from the frequency counts of Tables I and II—
the number of patterns in the NYSE/AMEX sample is considerably larger than those of the

Nasdaq sample for all ten patterns. Tables V and VI seem to suggest important differences
in the informativeness of technical indicators for NYSE/AMEX and Nasdaq stocks.
Table VII and VIII report the results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (19) of the equality

of the conditional and unconditional return distributions for NYSE/AMEX (Table VII) and

Nasdaq (Table VIII) stocks, respectively, from 1962 to 1996, in five-year subperiods, and
in market-capitalization quintiles. Recall that conditional returns are defined as the one-

day return starting three days following the conclusion of an occurrence of a pattern. The

p-values are with respect to the asymptotic distribution of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
statistic given in (20).

Table VII shows that for NYSE/AMEX stocks, five of the ten patterns—HS, BBOT,
22

RTOP, RBOT, and DTOP—yield statistically significant test statistics, with p-values ranging from 0.000 for RBOT to 0.021 for DTOP patterns. However, for the other five patterns,

the p-values range from 0.104 for IRS to 0.393 for DBOT, which implies an inability to
distinguish between the conditional and unconditional distributions of normalized returns.
When we condition on declining volume trend as well, the statistical significance declines

for most patterns, but increases the statistical significance of TBOT patterns. In contrast,
conditioning on increasing volume trend yields an increase in the statistical significance of

BTOP patterns. This difference may suggest an important role for volume trend in TBOT

and BTOP patterns. The difference between the increasing and decreasing volume-trend

conditional distributions is statistically insignificant for almost all the patterns (the sole
exception is the TBOT pattern). This drop in statistical significance may be due to a lack
of power of the K-S test given the relatively small sample sizes of these conditional returns
(see Table I for frequency counts).

Table VIII reports corresponding results for the Nasdaq sample and as in Table VI, in

contrast to the NYSE/AMEX results, here all the patterns are statistically significant at
the 5 percent level. This is especially significant because the the Nasdaq. sample exhibits far

fewer patterns than the NYSE/AMEX sample (see Tables I and II), hence the K-S test is
likely to have lower power in this case.

As with the NYSE/AMEX sample, volume trend seems to provide little incremental
information for the Nasdaq sample except in one case: increasing volume and BTOP. And

except for the TTOP pattern, the K-S test still cannot distinguish between the decreasing
and increasing volume-trend conditional distributions, as the last pair of rows of Table Viii's

first panel indicates.

IV. Monte Carlo Analysis
Tables IX and X contain bootstrap percentiles for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the equal-

ity of conditional and unconditional one-day return distributions for NYSE/AMEX and Nas-

daq stocks, respectively, from 1962 to 1996, and for market-capitalization quintiles, under

the null hypothesis of equality, For each of the two sets of market data, two sample sizes,

23

in1 and in2, have been chosen to span the range of frequency counts of patterns reported
in Tables I and II. For each sample size m, we resample one-day normalized returns (with

replacement) to obtain a bootstrap sample of in1 observations, compute the KolmogorovSmirnov test statistic (against the entire sample of one-day normalized returns), and repeat
this procedure 1,000 times. The percentiles of the asymptotic distribution are also reported
for comparison under the column "-y".

Tables IX and X show that for a broad range of sample sizes and across size quintiles,
subperiod, and exchanges, the bootstrap distribution of the Kohnogorov-Smirnov statistic
is well approximated by its asymptotic distribution (20).

V. Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed a new approach to evaluating the efficacy of technical analysis. Based on smoothing techniques such as nonparametric kernel regression, our approach

incorporates the essehce of technical analysis: to identify regularities in the time series of

prices by extracting nonlinear patterns from noisy data. While human judgment is still
superior to most computational algorithms in the area of visual pattern recognition, recent
advances in statistical learning theory have had successful applications in fingerprint identification, handwriting analysis, and face recognition. Technical analysis may well be the next

frontier for such methods.

When applied to many stocks over many time periods, we find that certain technical
patterns do provide incremental information, especially for Nasdaq stocks. While this does
not necessarily imply that technical analysis can be used to generate "excess" trading profits,

it does raise the possibility that technical analysis can add value to the investment process.

Moreover, our methods suggest that technical analysis can be improved by using automated algorithms such as ours, and that traditional patterns such as head-and-shoulders and
rectangles, while sometimes effective, need not be optimal. In particular, it may be possible

to determine "optimal patterns" for detecting certain types of phenomena in financial time
series, e.g., an optimal shape for detecting stochastic volatility or changes in regime. More-

over, patterns that are optimal for detecting statistical anomalies need not be optimal for
24

trading profits, and vice versa. Such considerations may lead to an entirely new branch of
technical analysis, one based on selecting pattern recognition algorithms to optimize specific

objective functions. We hope to explore these issues more fully in future research.

25

1A similar approach has been proposed by Chang and Osler (1994) and Osler and Chang
(1995) for the case of foreign-currency trading rules based on a head-and-shouiders pattern. They develop an algorithm for automatically detecting geometric patterns in price or
exchange data by looking at properly defined local extrema.

3flespite the fact that K(x) is a probability density function, it plays no probabilistic
role in the subsequent analysis—it is merely a convenient method for computing a weighted
average, and does not imply, for example, that X is distributed according to K(x) (which
would be a parametric assumption).
4However, there are other bandwidth-selection methods that yield the same asymptotic
optimality properties but which have different implications for the finite-sample properties
of kernel estimators. See Hãrdle (1990) for further discussion.
5Specifically, we produced fitted curves for various bandwidths and compared their extrema to the original price series visually to see if we were fitting more "noise" than "signal,"
and asked several professional technical analysts to do the same. Through this informal process, we settled on the bandwidth of 0.3 x h and used it for the remainder of our analysis.
This procedure was followed before we performed the statistical analysis of Section III, and
we made no revision to the choice of bandwidth afterwards.

window.

9For example, Chang and Osler (1994) and Osler and Chang (1995) propose an algorithm
for automatically detecting head-and-shoulders patterns in foreign exchange data by looking
at properly defined local extrema. To assess the efficacy of a head-and-shoulders trading rule,
they take a stand on a class of trading strategies and compute the profitability of these across
a sample of exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The null return distribution is computed
by a bootstrap that samples returns randomly from the original data so as to induce temporal
independence in the bootstrapped time series. By comparing the actual returns from trading
strategies to the bootstrapped distribution, the authors find that for two of the six currencies

in their sample (the yen and the Deutsche mark), trading strategies based on a head and
shoulders pattern can lead to statistically significant profits. See, also, Neftci and Policano
(1984), Pruitt and White (1988), and Brock, Lakonishok, and LeBaron (1992).

in a given period, we estimate the security's drift and diffusion coefficients by maximum
likelihood and then simulate prices using the estimated parameter values. An independent

price series is simulated for each of the 350 securities in both the NYSE/AMEX and the
Nasdaq samples. Finally, we use our pattern recognition algorithm to detect the occurrence
of each of the ten patterns in the simulated price series.

Table I
Frequency counts for 10 technical indicators detected among NYSE/AMEX stocks from 1962 to
1996, in 5-year subperiods, in size quintiles, and in a sample of simulated geometric Brownian
motion. In each 5-year subperiod, 10 stocks per quintile are selected at random among stocks with
at least 80% non-missing prices, and each stock's price history is scanned for any occurrence of the
following 10 technical indicators within the subperiod: head-and-shoulders (HS), inverted headand-shoulders (IRS), broadening top (BTOP), broadening bottom (BBOT), triangle top (TTOP),
triangle bottom (TBOT), rectangle top (RTOP), rectangle bottom (RBOT), double top (DTOP),
and double bottom (DBOT). The 'Sample' column indicates whether the frequency counts are
conditioned on decreasing volume trend ('r(\)'), increasing volume trend ("r(4'), unconditional
('Entire'), or for a sample of simulated geometric Brownian motion with parameters calibrated to
match the data ('Sim. GBM').

Table III
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness, and excess kurtosis) of raw and conditional 1-day normalized returns of NYSE/AMEX stocks from 1962 to 1996, in 5-year subperiods,
and in size quintiles. Conditional returns are defined as the daily return three days following
the conclusion of an occurrence of one of 10 technical indicators: head-and-shoulders (HS), inverted head-and-shoulders (IllS), broadening top (BTOP), broadening bottom (BBOT), triangle
top (TTOP), triangle bottom (TROT), rectangle top (RTOP), rectangle bottom (RBOT), double
top (DTOP), and double bottom (DBOT). All returns have been normalized by subtraction of
their means and division by theft standard deviations.

Goodness-of-fit diagnostics for the conditional 1-day normalized returns, conditional on 10 technical indicators, for a sample of 350
NYSE/AMEX stocks from 1962 to 1996 (10 stocks per size-quintile with at least 80% non-missing prices are randomly chosen in each
five-year subperiod, yielding 50 stocks per subperiod over 7 subperiods). For each pattern, the percentage of conditional returns that
fall within each of the 10 unconditional-return deciles is tabulated. If conditioning on the pattern provides no information, the expected
percentage falling in each decile is 10%. Asymptotic t-statistics for this null hypothesis are reported in parentheses, and the x2 goodnessof-fitness test statistic Q is reported in the last column with the p-value in parentheses below the statistic. The 10 technical indicators
are: head-and-shoulders (US), inverted head-and-shoulders (IllS), broadening top (BTOP), broadening bottom (BBOT), triangleS top
(TTOP), triangle bottom (TBOT), rectangle top (RTOP), rectangle bottom (RBOT), double top (DTOP), and double bottom (DBOT).

Table VII
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the equality of conditional and unconditional 1-day return distributions
for NYSE/AMEX stocks from 1962 to 1996, in 5-year subperiods, and in size quintiles. Conditional
returns are defined as the daily return three days following the conclusion of an occurrence of one of
10 technical indicators: head-and-shoulders (HS), inverted head-and-shoulders (1115), broadening

top (BTOP), broadening bottom (BBOT), triangle top (PTOP), triangle bottom (TBOT), rectangle top (RTOP), rectangle bottom (RBOT), double top (DTOP), and double bottom (DBOT).
All returns have been normalized by subtraction of their means and division by their standard
deviations, p-values are with respect to the asymptotic distribution of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test statistic. The symbols 'r(x,j' and '-r(4' indicate that the conditional distribution is also
conditioned on decreasing and increasing volume trend, respectively.

TabLe VIII
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the equality of conditional and unconditional 1-day return distributions for NASDAQ stocks from 1962 to 1996, in 5-year subperiods, and in size quintiles. Conditional
returns are defined as the daily return three days following the conclusion of an occurrence of one of
10 technical indicators: head-and-shoulders (HS), inverted head-and-shoulders (IHS), broadening
top (BTOP), broadening bottom (BBOT), triangle top (TTOP), triangle bottom (TBOT), rectangle top (RTOP), rectangle bottom (RBOT), double top (DTOP), and double bottom (DBOT).
All returns have been normalized by subtraction of their means and division by their standard
deviations, p-values are with respect to the asymptotic distribution of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov

test statistic. The symbols 'r(N)' and 'r(4'

indicate that the conditional distribution is also

conditioned on decreasing and increasing volume trend, respectively.

Table IX
Bootstrap percentiles for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the equality of conditional and unconditional 1-day return distributions for NYSE/AMEX and NASDAQ stocks from 1962 to 1996, and
for size quintiles, under the null hypothesis of equality. For each of the two sets of market data,
two sample sizes, in1 and in2, have been chosen to span the range of frequency counts of patterns
reported in Table 1. For each sample size mj, we resample 1-day normalized returns (with replacement) to obtain a bootstrap sample of mj observations, compute the Kohnogorov-Smirnov test
statistic (against the entire sample of 1-day normalized returns), and repeat this procedure 1,000
times. The percentiles of the asymptotic distribution are also reported for comparison.
