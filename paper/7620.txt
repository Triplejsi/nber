Government Ownership of Banks

NBER Working Paper No. 7620
March 2000
JEL No.G21, L32, O4
ABSTRACT
In this paper, we investigate a neglected aspect of financial systems of many countries around
the world: government ownership of banks. We assemble data which establish four findings. First,
government ownership of banks is large and pervasive around the world. Second, such ownership
is particularly significant in countries with low levels of per capita income, underdeveloped financial
systems, interventionist and inefficient governments, and poor protection of property rights. Third,
government ownership of banks is associated with slower subsequent financial development. Finally,
government ownership of banks is associated with lower subsequent growth of per capita income,
and in particular with lower growth of productivity rather than slower factor accumulation. This
evidence is inconsistent with the optimistic “development” theories of government ownership of
banks common in the 1960s, but supports the more recent “political” theories of the effects of
government ownership of firms.

I. Introduction.
This paper discusses a neglected aspect of financial systems of many countries:
government ownership of banks. It shows that such ownership is pervasive around the world,
especially in countries with poor institutions, and that it has significant consequences for resource
allocation and economic development.
There are two broad views of the government’s participation in financial markets. The
first, basically optimistic, “development” view is associated with Alexander Gerschenkron (1962),
who focuses on the necessity of financial development for economic growth. Gerschenkron
argues that privately owned commercial banks have been the crucial vehicle of channeling savings
to industry in several industrializing countries in the second half of the 19th century, especially
Germany. However, in some countries -- most conspicuously Russia -- economic institutions
were not sufficiently developed for private banks to play the crucial development role. “The
scarcity of capital in Russia was such that no banking system could conceivably succeed in
attracting sufficient funds to finance a large scale industrialization; the standards of honesty in
business were so disastrously low, the general distrust of the public so great, that no bank could
have hoped to attract even such small capital funds as were available, and no bank could have
successfully engaged in long term credit policies in an economy where fraudulent bankruptcy had
been almost elevated to the rank of a general business practice” (p. 19). In such countries, the
government could step in and through its financial institutions jump start both financial and
economic development. Thus in Russia in the 1890s, “it was the government that generally
fulfilled the function of industrial banks” (p.22), with salutary effects.
Gerschenkron’s view was part of a broader sentiment in development economics which

3

advocated government ownership of firms in the strategic economic sectors (see Shleifer 1998 for
a summary). W. Arthur Lewis (1950), for example, explicitly advocates government ownership
of banks, as part of the “commanding heights” approach whereby the government would develop
certain strategic industries through both direct ownership and control over finance. Myrdal
(1968) is sympathetic toward government ownership of banks in India and other Asian countries.
A few days before the October Revolution, Lenin laid out his own perspective on banking:
“Without big banks, socialism would be impossible. The big banks are the ‘state apparatus’ which
we need to bring about socialism, and which we take ready-made from capitalism...” (Lenin 1917,
quoted in Garvy 1977, p. 21). These ideas were widely adopted around the world, particularly in
the 1960s and the 1970s, with governments nationalizing the existing commercial banks and
starting new ones in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
In contrast, a more recent “political” view of government ownership holds that
government control of finance, through its banks or otherwise, politicizes resource allocation for
the sake of getting votes or bribes for office holders, softens budget constraints, and lowers
economic efficiency (see, e.g., Kornai 1979, Shleifer and Vishny 1994). This view is buttressed
by considerable evidence documenting the inefficiency of government enterprises, the political
motives behind public provision of services, and the benefits of privatization (e.g, Megginson et
al. 1994, Barberis et al. 1996, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny 1997, Frydman et al. 1999,
La Porta and Lopez-de-Silanes 1999). Gerschenkron has some sympathy for this view: “There is
no doubt that the government as an agens movens of industrialization discharged its role in a far
less than perfectly efficient manner. Incompetence and corruption of bureaucracy were great.
The amount of waste that accompanied the process were formidable.” (p. 20). Still,

4

Gerschenkron considers government financing of industrialization in Russia a great success.
The government can participate in the financing of firms in a variety of ways: it can
provide subsidies directly, it can encourage private banks through regulation and suasion to lend
to politically desirable projects, or it can own financial institutions -- completely or partially -itself. The advantage of owning banks -- as opposed to regulating banks or owning all projects
outright -- is that bank ownership gives the government extensive control over the choice of
projects being financed while leaving the implementation of these projects to the private sector.
Ownership of banks thus promotes the government’s goals in both the “development” and the
“political” theories. In the development theories, ownership of banks enables the government
both to collect savings and to direct them toward strategic long term projects. Through such
project finance, the government overcomes institutional failures undermining private capital
markets, and generates aggregate demand and other beneficial externalities fostering growth. In
the political theories, ownership of banks enables the government to finance the inefficient but
politically desirable projects. In both theories, the government finances projects that would not
get privately financed. In the development theories, these projects are socially desirable. In the
political theories, they are not.
Using data on government ownership of banks from 92 countries around the world, we
address four related questions. First, how significant is government ownership of banks in
different countries? Second, what types of countries have more government ownership of banks?
Third, does government ownership of banks promote subsequent financial development? Fourth,
does government ownership of banks promote subsequent economic growth and, relatedly, how
does it effect factor accumulation, savings, and growth of productivity?

5

Both the development and the political view imply that government ownership of banks
should be more prevalent in poorer countries, countries with less developed financial markets, and
more generally, countries with less well functioning institutions. The development theories also
imply that, other things equal, government ownership of banks should benefit subsequent financial
and economic development, factor accumulation, and especially productivity growth. The
political theories, in contrast, imply that, other things equal, government ownership of banks
should displace (crowd out) the growth of private financing. Moreover, while government
financing through its banks can encourage savings and capital accumulation, the projects the
government finances are likely to be inefficient and have an adverse effect on productivity growth.
By looking at financial development and productivity growth, we can thus attempt to distinguish
the two theories of government ownership of banks.
Although our results support some elements of the development view, they are overall
more favorable to the political view. We show, first, that government ownership of banks is
common around the world: in an average country, 42 percent of equity of the 10 largest banks
was still owned by the government in 1995. We also show that government ownership of banks
is especially common in poor countries, as well as in countries with poorly defined property
rights, heavy government intervention in the economy, and underdeveloped financial systems.
The latter findings are consistent with Gerschenkron’s idea of where governments are likely to
own banks. However, our results on the effects of government ownership of banks on financial
and economic development do not support Gerschenkron’s optimism. We find that higher
government ownership of banks is associated with slower subsequent development of the financial
system, lower economic growth, and in particular lower growth of productivity. These results --

6

and particularly the finding of low productivity growth in countries with high government
ownership of banks -- are broadly supportive of the political view on the effects of government
interference in markets.
This research relates to a number of strands in the recent literature of financial
development and economic growth. King and Levine (1993), Levine and Zervos (1998), Rajan
and Zingales (1998), Beck, Levine, Loayza (2000), Levine (1999), and Wurgler (2000) all
document the benefits of financial development for economic growth. Young (1995) shows that
in several East Asian countries growth has taken the form of factor accumulation rather than
productivity growth. Since the allocation of financial resources in East Asian economies is
heavily politicized, our results suggest that the same problems that have influenced productivity
growth in East Asia may be pervasive when the government controls the flow of capital.
Two recent papers consider government ownership of banks. Sapienza (1999) finds that
Italian state-owned banks pursue political objectives in their lending policies, consistent with the
political view. Barth, Caprio and Levine (1999) present a comprehensive data base on
government regulation of banks around the world. Like our paper, they find that government
ownership of banks is higher in countries with less developed financial systems. This result is
consistent with both the political and the development views.
The next four sections deal with the four questions raised above: the pervasiveness of
government ownership of banks, the characteristics of countries that have it, its effect on financial
development, and its effect on the growth of output, factor accumulation, and growth of
productivity. Section VI concludes.

II. How common is government ownership of banks?
Variable Definitions
All the variables used in this paper are summarized in Table 1. We describe them at the
time we introduce them into the analysis.
We analyze government ownership of large banks in 92 countries. We use Polk World
Banking Profiles and the Thomson Bank Directory for 1996 to determine the number of countries
with sufficient data on banks. For each country in the sample, we identify the 10 largest
commercial or development banks (in terms of assets) that lend money to firms, regardless of their
ownership structure and of whether or not they take deposits. We include development banks
because their function is precisely to provide long term finance to development projects where
private finance may fail (Myrdal 1968), and hence they constitute one prominent form of
government entry into bank lending. Below we discuss the role of development banks at some
length. We do not include Central Banks, Postal Banks (which generally do not lend money to
firms and are described as non-banking institutions), investment banks, other specialized financial
intermediaries (trust companies, home loan banks) or world-wide development banks such as the
World Bank. If a country has fewer than 10 banks in Polk and Thomson, we add information
where we can from Europa Yearbook and Euromoney Bank Register 1996.
We identify ownership structures of banks in this sample using company reports as well as
national and international sources (Appendix A lists the sources for each country). Identifying
state versus private ownership is usually straightforward, but there are a few judgment calls.
First, we classify ownership by foreign governments as private rather than state ownership. This
reduces estimates of state ownership, but makes analytical sense since foreign governments are

8

less likely to support money-losing firms abroad. Second, we keep subsidiaries of foreign banks
in the sample as long as they make loans and extend credit locally. Third, some development
banks in the sample are regional, and owned by the governments of several countries. Some of
these banks also have private owners, as well as ownership by multilateral agencies such as the
World Bank. We take the equity ownership in a regional bank by a country’s government as the
estimate of the proportion of the bank’s assets that are in that country. These steps give us
estimates of government ownership of the 10 largest banks in each country.
Using these data, we compute five measures of government ownership of banks, each
calculated to emphasize a somewhat different aspect of ownership. In all these calculations, we
address the issue of indirect ownership by the government, i.e., governments owning shares in
holding or other companies which in turn own shares in sample banks. The first measure, GB
(government banking), is defined as follows. For each of the 10 largest commercial and
development banks in a country, we first calculate the percentage of government ownership by
multiplying the share of each shareholder in that bank by the share the government owns in that
shareholder, and then summing the resulting shares:

GB ik =

J

∑s

ji

s gj

j =1

where k = 1....92 indexes the countries in our sample, i = 1....10 indexes the ten largest banks in a
country, j = 1....J indexes shareholders of a given bank, GBik stands for the government’s share in
bank i in country k, sji is the share of bank i owned by shareholder j, and sgj is the share of equity
the government owns in j (sgj = 0 if j is a private individual). For example, the government of
9

Israel owns 86.2% of the shares in Bank Leumi. In this case, J = 1, s1i = .862 and sgi = 1 for this
bank.
GB for a country k is computed by multiplying GBik of every sampled bank i by its total
assets, summing the resulting numbers and dividing the sum by total assets of the top 10 banks:

10

GBk =

∑GB a

ik ik

i=1

10

∑a
i=1

ik

where GBk is the first measure of government bank ownership for country k, and aik are the total
assets of bank i. GB is the simplest measure we use: it captures the share of the assets of the top
10 banks in a given country that is “owned” as opposed to “controlled” by the government.
GB reflects government ownership of banks in the mid 1990s, well after privatization of
banks in many countries had gotten underway. Since we are ultimately interested in the effect of
government ownership of banks on economic development, we need to estimate the percentage of
banking assets owned by the government in the 1960s and 1970s, before privatizations. We could
not determine fully the history of ownership of each bank back to 1960, but did come up with
estimates of government ownership in our sample banks in 1985, roughly at the peak of
government ownership around the world and before bank privatization had started in any country
but Chile. Since we know which of the banks in our sample had been privatized after 1985, we
can determine government ownership in these banks before privatization. This variable, GBBP -government banking before privatization, is constructed like GB, except that if a bank was
10

privatized after 1985, we set GBBPik equal to the percentage of that bank actually owned by the
government before privatization. In the countries where we know that the entire banking system
was owned by the government in 1985, including Sri Lanka, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Mexico and
12 socialist countries, we set GBBP = 1. A possible problem with GBBP is that the top 10 list is
taken in 1995, so we may underestimate government ownership in 1985 if large state owned
banks circa 1985 were no longer the largest by 1995. We use GBBP in the regressions. Since the
correlation between GB and GBBP is .78, it does not matter which variable we use.
GB does not take into account the possibility that the extent of government control of a
bank, particularly when the government is a large shareholder, may exceed its equity ownership.
The next 3 variables, all based on government ownership in the mid-1990s, classify banks as
“government-owned” when the government’s equity ownership exceeds certain thresholds. We
use these variables to make sure that our two basic variables do not produce a misleading answer.
To construct the next variable, GB20, we start with government ownership measures for
each of the 10 largest banks. We then classify a bank as government-owned if GBik > .2 and the
government is the largest known shareholder or if GBik >.5 (in case we do not know the
percentage ownership by the largest shareholder). GB20 is the sum of assets of all governmentowned banks using this definition (among the 10 largest) divided by the total assets of 10 largest
banks in the country. This approach is in line with our earlier work which suggests that 20%
ownership is typically sufficient for control (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer 1999).
Along similar lines, we construct GB50 as a ratio of the assets of the banks in which the
government holds over 50% of equity to the total assets of the 10 largest banks; and GB90 as a
corresponding measure for banks where government equity ownership exceeds 90%. Before
11

presenting the results, we note that these measures of government ownership of banks are highly
correlated with each other: the correlation between GB and GB20 is .95; the correlation between
GB and GB50 is .97, and the correlation between GB and GB90 is .92. The correlations between
these variables and GBBP are in the .7-.8 range.

Findings
Table 2 presents our basic findings on the extent of government ownership of banks. We
divide countries into groups by the origin of their commercial laws (common law, French civil
law, German civil law, Scandinavian law and socialist law). Our previous research shows that the
nature of both financial markets and government involvement in economic life differs significantly
across legal origins (La Porta et al., or LLSV, 1997, 1998, 1999).
Government ownership of banks is large and pervasive around the world. Even looking at
the 1995 data, after bank privatization had been completed in many countries, the world mean of
government ownership is 41.7 percent, and a somewhat lower 38.7 percent if we exclude the
former socialist countries. The corresponding number for pre-privatization ownership is an even
higher 55 percent (and 48.3 percent if we exclude the former socialist countries). The magnitude
of the post-privatization number suggests that, while privatization has made a dent in government
ownership of banks, it has not reduced it to negligible levels.
Our adjustments for government control relative to cash flow ownership also increase the
world average compared to the basic variable. Using GB20 to measure government control, the
world average share of banking assets controlled by the government is 48 percent (43.9 percent
without former socialist countries). As we illustrate below, these magnitudes are considerably

12

higher than the measures of government participation in more general economic activity such as
production or investment. These findings establish our first proposition: government ownership
of banks is very large -- even after the wave of privatizations.
It is also pervasive across continents and legal origins of commercial laws. Outside of the
few rich common law countries and Japan (at the time we took the measurement), governments
nearly everywhere own a respectable share of bank equity. The common law average is a high
28.5 percent (37.2 percent before privatization), though still statistically significantly lower than
the French civil law origin average of 45.5 percent (56.3 percent before privatization). As is often
in these comparisons of financial structures, the German and the Scandinavian averages are
between the English and French ones, and close to each other. The former socialist countries still
have the highest average share of equity of the largest banks owned by the government (61.8
percent), although this share is down sharply from 100 percent 10 years ago. The corrections for
government control change these numbers somewhat, but do not alter the general picture of high
and pervasive government ownership of banks, occurring nearly everywhere but especially in
French civil law and socialist law countries.
Table 2B examines the importance of development banks in our sample. Its first column
shows, by legal origin, how much of the government ownership of top 10 banks is accounted for
by government ownership of development banks. On average, about 5.3 percent out of 41.7
percent overall level of government ownership is accounted for by development banks.
Development banks are particularly prevalent in French legal origin countries (largely in Latin
America), and utterly uncommon in German, Scandinavian, and socialist origin countries.
The second column of Table 2B reproduces the averages of GB from Table 2, and the

13

third column shows how these averages change when we take development banks out of the
sample (i.e., both the numerator and the denominator in the definition of GB). The corrected
variable, government ownership of commercial banks or GBC, has a worldwide average of 38.4
percent (compared to 41.7 percent for GB). The difference between French and English origins
remains large, though not longer statistically significant.
Conceptually, we believe it is appropriate to include development banks in the sample,
since in some countries these are precisely the banks allegedly addressing the GerschenkronMyrdal development problems. We therefore keep these banks in the results we present. To be
safe, we have redone every regression excluding them. The statistical significance of some results
falls a notch, but the important results presented below remain statistically significant.
The results on the differences in government ownership of banks among legal origins are
in principle consistent with both the development and the political view. Earlier research (LLSV
1997, 1998) shows that countries with French legal origin laws have less investor protection and
less developed private financial markets than do common law countries, which on the
development view would increase the demand for government provision of finance. Other
research (LLSV 1999) shows that French legal origin countries in general intervene more in
economic life. Consistent with the political view, then, government ownership of banks may be a
reflection of the greater politicization of economic activity in French legal origin (and socialist)
countries than in common law countries. In the subsequent sections, we present further evidence
that attempts to distinguish the two theories. Importantly, all the results presented below have
been rerun excluding socialist countries, and none of the conclusions we draw depend on them.

14

III. Which countries have high government ownership of banks?
In this section, we ask which characteristics of countries predict high government
ownership of banks. We do so by first considering the correlations between various country
characteristics and our first two measures of government ownership of banks (after and before
privatization). Because these correlations may be influenced by the fact that poorer countries
generally have higher GB and GBBP, we also present the coefficients from regressions of
government ownership of banks on country characteristics, a constant, and the log of 1960 per
capita GDP. These results crudely correct for the differences in per capita incomes.
Table 1 describes all the data used in this paper, including the country characteristics we
examine. An important point should be noted. Due to data availability, most of the country
characteristics we examine come either from the 1990s, or alternatively are averages of the data
from 1975 to 1995, i.e., either at the same time as GB or later than GBBP. We cannot therefore
argue that these country characteristics in some ways cause high government ownership of banks.
Rather, we are only looking at correlations, without structural interpretations. For one important
set of measures, namely those of the level of private financial development, we have data starting
in 1960 and in 1970, and hence can ask more dynamic questions.
We begin the analysis with the 1960 level of per capita income, simply to point out that
poorer countries indeed have more government ownership of banks. We then examine a number
of indicators of the quality of government, some of which we have studied in an earlier paper
(LLSV 1999). These include measures of government intervention in economic life (such as
regulation, price controls, black market premium, political rights, and government spending),
measures of the efficiency of government (such as tax compliance, corruption and bureaucratic

15

quality), measures of the security of property rights, rule of law, and investor protection,
measures of the importance of state-owned firms in the overall economy as opposed to just in
banking, measures of initial levels of financial development, and finally, measures of the incidence
of political and financial crises in the economy.
Table 3 focuses on post-privatization government ownership of banks. Panel A
establishes that such ownership is higher in countries that were poorer in 1960. In the subsequent
panels, in addition to correlations, we present the coefficients from regressions controlling for (the
logarithm of)1960 per capita income. Panel B shows that countries with more interventionist
governments also have higher government ownership of banks. Heavier regulation, higher
frequency of price controls, heavier banking regulation, and higher black market exchange rate
premiums are all associated with greater government ownership of banks, even controlling for
initial per capita income. These correlations are high and statistically significant. At the same
time, there is no relationship between the size of government, as measured by government
consumption or government transfers and subsidies relative to GDP, and government bank
ownership. This may be partly due to the fact that these measures of government spending are
high in developed market economies, which generally have both big and good government (LLSV
1999). Finally, the evidence shows that government ownership of banks is lower in countries that
have wider political rights or are more democratic. Social as well as economic interventionism is
associated with higher government ownership of banks.
Panel C considers government efficiency, which is related to interventionism but is not
necessarily the same thing. Countries with less efficient governments have greater government
ownership of banks. Higher tax compliance, higher bureaucratic quality, and lower corruption are

16

all associated with lower government ownership of banks. The corruption index is not statistically
significant in a regression controlling for income, but other variables are.
Panel D focuses on the security of property rights. The first three variables -- the property
rights index, rule of law, and the likelihood of government repudiation of contracts -- all show
that countries with greater security of property rights have lower GB. This result is consistent
with Gerschenkron’s emphasis on poor protection of property rights in Russia as the reason why
government participation in financial markets was necessary. There is also weak evidence that
countries with higher LLSV (1998) indices of shareholder and creditor rights have lower
government ownership of banks.
Panel E examines the relationship between government ownership of banks and measures
of the importance of state owned enterprises (SOEs) in the economy, including an index of their
prevalence as well as measures of relative output, investment, and employment of SOEs. Not
surprisingly, countries with greater roles of SOEs in the economy also have higher government
ownership of banks. Perhaps a more interesting question is how the government ownership of
large banks compares to the measures of the importance of SOEs. Figures 1 and 2 present the
relevant plots. On average, government ownership of banks is higher than the measures of the
relative size of the SOEs in the economy. The numbers presented here are not, however, directly
comparable, since we do not consider the smaller banks, where government ownership may be
lower.
Panel F examines the relationship between government ownership of banks and measures
of financial, particularly banking, development. Our preferred measures of banking development
follow Beck, Levine, and Loayza (2000). These authors choose and defend theoretically three

17

variables: credit by financial intermediaries to the private sector relative to GDP, liquid liabilities
of the financial system relative to GDP, and a ratio of commercial bank domestic assets to
commercial plus central bank domestic assets. We also agree with Beck et al. that the first of
these measures is theoretically the most satisfactory. For the period starting in 1970, we have
further measures of financial development: the ratio of quasi-liquid liabilities to GDP, the ratio of
domestic credit to the banking sector to GDP, and the ratio of claims on the private sector to
GDP. The data on the first three variables in Panel F are for 1960, and on the second three for
1970 (in which case we control for 1970 log per capita GDP in the regressions.)
The data in Panel F show negative correlations between these measures of financial
development and government ownership of banks, though the results are only occasionally
significant. This evidence is consistent with both the development view that the government steps
in to help in the underdeveloped financial systems, and the political view that the government
displaces private financial institutions when it politicizes resource allocation.
Finally, in Panel G we examine the question of whether government ownership of banks is
associated with economic and political instability, as measured by inflation, the incidence of
political crises and coups, as well as the incidence and depth of banking crises. The data on
banking crises pertain to the period 1970-1990. Here causality is a particularly thorny issue, since
government ownership may be a cause of instability because of politicized lending, but may also
be a response to instability through nationalizations. Ironically, except for some weak evidence
that countries with higher inflation have higher government ownership of banks, the association
between such ownership and the available measures of instability is weak. This may be because of
the timing problems in the data. Alternatively, such factors as the general interventionist stance of

18

the government, its efficiency, and the security of property rights may be more important
correlates of government bank ownership than are the assorted crises.
We have redone this analysis using the pre- rather than post-privatization measure of
government ownership of banks. The results are extremely similar both in terms of the
coefficients and in terms of the patterns of statistical significance. In our growth analyses in the
following sections, we use GBBP, since it stands a better chance of being predetermined relative
to the growth experiences we study. Recall that the correlation between GB and GBBP is .78.
The evidence in this section is consistent with both the development and the political
views of government ownership of banks. Countries with high government ownership of banks
are indeed more backward and more statist: they are poorer, have more interventionist and less
efficient governments, as well as less secure property rights. There is weak evidence that
countries with less developed financial systems have higher government ownership of banks.
Are these interventionist and inefficient governments able to step in and, through their ownership
of banks, jump start the financial system and accelerate development, consistent with the
development view? Alternatively, do such governments simply politicize resource allocation
without much benefit to growth, consistent with the political view? In the next two sections, we
attempt to address these questions.

IV. Does government ownership of banks speed up financial development?
Gerschenkron suggests that the government, by participating in the financial sector, can
encourage the subsequent development of private lending, as it evidently did in Russia at the end
of the 19th century. The government may help to develop the institutions of lending such as

19

standardized contracts or specialized courts, show by example that long term lending is possible
and profitable, or simply subsidize private banks. In this section, we consider the growth of the
measures of financial development introduced in Panel F of Table 3 as a function of initial levels
of financial development and per capita income as well as of our measure of pre-privatization
government ownership of banks.
The results are presented in Table 4. The first panel considers the growth in Beck, Levine
and Loayza’s (2000) measures of financial development between 1960 and 1995 as a function of
1960 initial conditions and GBBP; note that we have extended their sample to cover 89
countries. The second panel considers the growth in all six measures of financial development
between 1970 and 1995 as a function of 1970 conditions and GBBP. Two results stand out in
this Table. First, the initial level of financial development is negatively correlated with its own
subsequent growth. This may be a statistical artefact, or simply reflect some convergence in
financial development. Second, government ownership of banks ceteris paribus reduces
subsequent financial development. Using growth since 1960, this effect is only statistically
significant at the 10 percent level for our preferred variable -- the growth in the ratio of private
credit to GDP. However, for the post-1970 period, this effect has some statistical significance for
4 out of 6 measures of financial development.
These results are inconsistent with the development view of government ownership of
banks. They are, however, consistent with the political view.

V. Does Government Ownership of Banks Speed Up Economic Growth?
In this section, we examine the effects of government ownership of banks on capital

20

accumulation, savings, and productivity growth.
Table 5 presents growth regressions for the periods 1960-1995 and 1970-1995, where the
dependent variable is the growth in per capita income. In Panel A, we include only the initial per
capita income and GBBP. The results confirm the standard “convergence” finding, namely that
initially poorer countries grow faster (Barro 1991). In addition, for both time periods, higher
GBBP is associated with statistically significantly slower economic growth. A parameter estimate
of around -2.5 suggests that, as ownership rises by 10 percentage points, growth falls by .25
percent per annum -- by no means a small effect. Although this result requires a number of
qualifications and robustness checks, taken up below, on its face it does not support the
development view that government participation in finance promotes economic development.
In Panel B, we control for average years of schooling, as is standard in growth
regressions. The coefficient on GBBP falls by about 20%, but remains statistically significant. In
Panel C, we add alternatively the three measures of initial financial development from Beck,
Levine and Loayza (2000). For two out of three measures, including the initial private credit
relative to GDP, the initial level of financial development exerts a positive influence on future
growth, consistent with the work of Levine and his co-authors. Yet holding initial financial and
economic development as well as schooling constant, GBBP continues to exert a large and
statistically significant negative effect on subsequent growth. The coefficient remains between 1.5 and -2.

Controlling for the traditional variables in the growth regressions, government

ownership of banks has a negative impact on subsequent economic growth.
One concern with these specifications is that GBBP may simply proxy for some alternative
measure of distortionary economic policies or poorly protected property rights. These policies,

21

rather than government ownership of banks per se, may retard economic growth (Knack and
Keefer 1995). After all, we have already shown that government ownership of banks is more
prevalent in countries with interventionist and inefficient governments, as well as poorly protected
property rights. In Table 6, we include some of the standard measures of government
intervention, using to the extent possible the earliest data available so that we can interpret these
variables as having a possible causal effect on growth. The inclusion of some of these variables
may spuriously reduce the effect of GBBP. In all these regressions, we include initial private
credit relative to GDP, initial economic development, average years of schooling, as well as a
number of geographic controls to address the spurious correlation issue.
Measures of government distortions do not eliminate the statistical significance of the
effect of GBBP on subsequent growth. The coefficient stays at around -1.5 indicating a large
effect on growth. In contrast, the distortions we measure do not themselves have statistically
significant effects on future growth when included in the regression with GBBP.
Following Beck, Levine and Loayza (2000), we next consider specific channels through
which government ownership of banks can influence economic growth. Panel A of Table 7
focuses on savings and capital accumulation. There is some evidence that initial per capita income
exerts a negative influence on capital accumulation, and a positive influence on savings. There is
also evidence that higher years of schooling are associated with higher capital accumulation.
Finally, there is some unsurprising evidence that greater initial financial development is associated
with faster subsequent capital accumulation, consistent with Beck et al.(2000). However, there
does not appear to be much evidence that government ownership of banks has a significant
influence on either capital accumulation or savings. The tiny positive (but insignificant) effect of

22

government ownership of banks on savings provides mild support for the development view,
although the increased savings -- to the extent that there are any -- do not seem to go into capital
formation.
Panel B of Table 7 focuses on the growth in productivity. Following Beck, Levine and
Loayza (2000), we consider three measures of productivity growth (see Table 1 for exact
definitions). The first measure derives productivity growth as output growth adjusted for capital
accumulation. The second and third measures also adjust output growth estimates by the growth
of human capital. We have been able to expand the Beck et al. sample from 61 to 77 countries
for their first two measures of productivity growth, but not for the third one, since the data
needed for the last productivity measure were not available for the extra countries. As in the
various specifications, we also use the controls introduced earlier.
The results on productivity growth are striking. GBBP exerts a negative and, in most
specifications, statistically significant effect on future productivity growth, even controlling for
initial financial development and schooling. The coefficients, depending on the specification, are
between -1 and -2, indicating that a 10 percentage point higher measure of government ownership
is associated with .1 to .2 percent per annum lower rate of productivity growth. The bottom line
of these results is that productivity is the place where government ownership of banks negatively
impacts growth.
This evidence is broadly consistent with the political view according to which government
ownership creates resource misallocations that are detrimental to productivity growth and
ultimately economic growth itself. The evidence on resource misallocation is also consistent with
Sapienza’s (1999) findings for Italian banks, as well as with a large literature on state firms.

23

Finally, the data support Young’s (1995) interpretation of Asian growth. The evidence is not,
however, consistent with the development view of the beneficial effects of government ownership
of banks on productivity growth.
Table 8 presents some additional tests of the political theory, by asking what effects
government ownership of banks has on two rough proxies of the efficiency of resource
allocation. First, does the share of private credit that goes to firms outside the top 20 depend on
government ownership of banks? If that share is lower when GBBP is higher, it may suggest that
when a government controls banks it allocates a lion share of the credit to the largest firms,
thereby depriving the smaller firms of credit. Second, is the spread between the lending and the
deposit rate increasing with government ownership of banks? If it is, government ownership may
reduce the efficiency of the banking sector itself.
Table 8 shows that countries with higher GBBP allocate a lower share of private credit to
firms outside the top 20. Countries with a higher GBBP also have higher markups in the banking
sector. This evidence is consistent with the view that government ownership of banks is
associated with a misallocation of resources in the economy.
One possible concern about our growth analysis is the endogeneity of government
ownership of banks. We have presented in Table 3 some evidence indicating that financial and
economic crises do not appear to be good predictors of government ownership. But there
remains a concern that some deeper structural factors both cause government ownership of banks
and slow down the growth of productivity and output. Although there is no perfect way to
address this concern, we can try to address it in part by using instrumental variables to predict
government ownership of banks. As instruments, we use the variables that have been introduced

24

in our earlier work (LLSV 1997, 1998, 1999), and have been previously used in a similar context
by Beck, Levine and Loayza, namely legal origins and religious compositions of the populations in
different countries. These variables have the advantage of being historically predetermined,
correlated with government ownership of banks (see Table 2), and possibly uncorrelated with the
residual.
Table 9 presents the results of these instrumental variable regressions for the growth of
income, growth of capital, savings rates, and productivity growth, using various control variables.
In most specifications, the instrumental variable results are similar to the OLS results, although
the magnitude of the coefficients on GBBP in some instances increases sharply. The predicted
component of GBBP exerts a sharp negative effect on both the growth in income and the growth
in productivity, although not on capital accumulation and savings. In some productivity
specifications, the coefficient rises by a factor of 3 from its OLS levels, implying very large effects
on productivity growth. The last column in Table 9 presents the results of Lagrange Multiplier
tests of the null hypothesis that our instruments are uncorrelated with the residuals. The tests do
not reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are appropriate at the 5 percent or the 1 percent
significance levels. The instrumental variable results corroborate our earlier findings and support
the political view of government ownership of banks as detrimental rather than helpful to
economic development. There always remains a possibility, however, that some omitted factor
both increases the desirable level of government ownership of banks and reduces economic
growth.
Finally, Table 10 presents a somewhat different perspective on the development thesis. In
principle, it could be argued that the benefits of government ownership of banks appear only in

25

backward countries with extremely poorly developed economic, financial, and property rights
regimes. By grouping all countries into a regression, we may have failed to test this theory
correctly. In Table 10, we reproduce some of our analyses by dividing the sample into the
relatively rich and relatively poor countries as of 1960, relatively financially developed and
relatively financially underdeveloped countries as of 1960, and countries with good and poor
protection of property rights, for which an assessment is only available for the 1990s. The results
do not support the development thesis: GBBP has a particularly adverse effect on the growth of
income in the more backward countries, namely those with lower initial income, lower initial
financial development, and weaker property rights protection. In the more advanced countries,
the effect of GBBP on growth is still negative but often statistically insignificant. Perhaps the
richer countries can get around the distortions associated with heavy government involvement in
the financial sphere, whereas the more backward countries cannot, and pay with a sharply lower
rate of growth of output and productivity.

VI. Conclusion.
In this paper, we investigated a neglected aspect of financial systems of many countries
around the world: government ownership of banks. The data shed light on four issues. First,
government ownership of banks is large and pervasive around the world. Second, such ownership
is larger in countries with low levels of per capita income, underdeveloped financial systems,
interventionist and inefficient governments, and poor protection of property rights. Third,
government ownership of banks is associated with slower subsequent financial development.
Finally, government ownership of banks is associated with lower subsequent growth of per capita

26

income, and in particular with lower productivity growth rather than slower factor accumulation.
These retarding effects of government ownership of banks appear to be especially significant in
the less developed countries.
Some aspects of the empirical story are consistent with the 1960s development economics
view that government ownership of banks may arise as a response to institutional and financial
underdevelopment. However, the results reject the optimistic assessment inherent in this view of
the beneficial consequences of such ownership for subsequent development, advanced by
Gerschenkron (1962), Myrdal (1968) and others. In contrast, the results are consistent with the
political view of government ownership of firms, including banks, according to which such
ownership politicizes the resource allocation process and reduces efficiency. Ultimately, and in
line with the latter theories, government ownership of banks retards financial and economic
development, especially in poor countries.

Liquid liabilities of the financial system (currency plus demand and interest-bearing liabilities of the banks and non-banks
financial intermediaries) divided by GDP. The variable is constructed following the methodology of Beck, Levine and
Loayza (2000) based on data from the International Financial Statistics. Liquid liabilities is calculated using line 55l (liquid
liabilities) or line 35l (money plus quasi money), if liquid liabilities is not available. If none of these two numbers are
available, we use line 25 (time and saving deposits). Data for GDP uses line 99b, and data for CPI comes from line64 and
the monthly statistics from the IFS database. For most countries, the data is available for the period 1960-1995. Source:
International Financial Statistics database and Beck, Levine and Loayza (2000).

It is the ratio of commercial bank domestic assets divided by commercial banks domestic assets plus central bank domestic
assets. The variable is constructed following the methodology of Beck, Levine and Loayza (2000). Based on data from
the International Financial Statistics using lines 22a-d for the assets of deposit money banks, and lines 12a-d for the assets
of the central bank. For most countries, the data is available for the period 1960-1995. Source: International Financial
Statistics database and Beck, Levine Loayza (2000).

Claims on the private sector as a percentage of GDP. Claims on the private sector refers to financial resources provided to
the private sector --such as through loans, purchases of nonequity securities, and trade credits and other accounts receivable–
that establish a claim for repayment. For a few countries these claims include credit to public enterprises when it is not
available separately. Claims on the private sector include gross credit from the financial system to individuals, enterprises,
nonfinancial public entities not included under net domestic credit, and financial institutions not included elsewhere. The
data comes from line 32d of the International Financial Statistics. For most countries, the data is available for the period
1970-1995. Source: World Development Indicators based on data from the International Financial Statistics.

89

Quasi-liquid liabilities as a percentage of GDP. Quasi-liquid liabilities are the sum of currency deposits in the central bank
(M0), plus time and saving deposits, foreign currency transferable deposits, certificates of deposit, and securities repurchase
agreements, plus travelers checks, foreign currency time deposits, commercial paper, and shares of mutual funds or market
funds held by residents. They equal the M3 money supply less transferable deposit and electronic currency (M1). For most
countries, the data is available for the period 1970-1995. Source: World Development Indicators based on data from the

Domestic credit provided
by banking sector / GDP

Domestic credit provided by the banking sector as a percentage of GDP. Domestic credit provided by the banking sector
includes all credit to various sectors on a gross basis, with the exception of credit to the central government, which is net.
The banking sector includes monetary authorities and deposit money banks, as well as other banking institutions where data
are available (including institutions that do not accept transferable deposits but do incur such liabilities as time and savings
deposits). Examples of other banking institutions are savings and mortgage loan institutions and building and loan
associations. Data for domestic credit comes from lines 32an, 32b, 32c, 32d, 32f and 32g of the International Financial
Statistics. For most countries, the data is available for the period 1970-1995. Source: World Development Indicators based

Table 3
Which countries have more government ownership of commercial banks?
The first column shows the correlation between each variable and the extent of government ownership of commercial banks in 1995. The second column shows
the coefficients and their significance resulting from ordinary least squares regressions of the cross-section of countries. The independent variables are classified
into five different groups: (i) initial level of development; (ii) government intervention; (iii)government efficiency; (iv) property rights; (v) state owned enterprises;
(vi) initial level of financial development; (vii) crisis and instability . Each regression controls for the log of GDP per capita in 1960. Robust standard errors
are shown in parentheses.

Table 9
Instrumental variables: growth, capital accumulation and productivity growth
Instrumental variables (IV) regressions for the cross-section of countries in the sample. The first stage dependent variable
is “Government ownership in banks before privatization (GBBP).” This variable is instrumented by dummy variables that
reflect the legal origin of the country (Common law, French civil law, German civil law, Scandinavian civil law, and
Socialist legal origin) and by variables that capture the percentage of the population in each country that belong to the
largest religions in the world (protestant, catholic, muslim and the remaining religions grouped together). The second stage
dependent variables are: (1) GDP per capita growth rate for 1960-1995; (2) GNP per capita growth rate for 1970-1995;
(3) Physical capital per capita growth rate 1960-1995; (4) savings to GDP ratio for 1960-1992; (5) Productivity per capita
growth rate 1 for 1960-1995; (6) Productivity per capita growth rate 2 for 1960-1995; and (7) Productivity per capita
growth rate 3 for 1960-1995. Standard errors are shown in parenthesis. The last column shows the P2 results for a
Hausman (1978) Lagrange Multiplier test. The null hypothesis is that the instruments used are not correlated with the
residuals. Critical values of P2 for the L-M test (8 d.f.) are: 5 % = 15.5073; 1 % = 20.0902.

Table 10
Growth by groups of countries
Ordinary least square regressions (OLS) of different groups of countries classified according to country characteristics. The dependent
variable in all regressions shown is the average annual growth of GDP per capita for the period 1960-1995. The independent variables are
described in Table 1. The table has three panels corresponding to different classifications of the countries in the sample. Panel A divides
the sample in those countries with initial GDP per capita in 1960 below the median and those above the median. Panel B divides the sample
in those countries with initial level of financial development below and those above the median as measured by private credit as a proportion
of GDP in 1960. Panel C divides the sample in those countries with property rights in the 1990s below the median and those above the
median value for the sample.
