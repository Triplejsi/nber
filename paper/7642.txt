Trade and the Rate of Income Convergence

JEL No. F1, O1, O5

ABSTRACT
To the extent that trade policy affects trade flows between countries, the ramifications can
be far-reaching from an economic growth perspective. This paper examines one aspect of these
ramifications, namely the impact of changes in the extent of trade between countries on changes in
the rate of reduction in the size of the income gap that exists between them. Export and import data
are used as the criteria for determining bilateral trade between major trade partners, resulting in the
creation of 127 pairs of countries on the basis of export data and 134 pairs on the basis of import
data. An increase in trade between major trade partners - and in particular, increased exports by
poorer countries to their wealthier partners - is shown to be related to an increase in the rate of
convergence between the countries.

I. INTRODUCTION
In a world that exhibits non-decreasing income gaps (and in many cases, increasing gaps)
between most of the countries, there is nonetheless a small minority of countries exhibiting
income convergence. Not all of these instances of convergence are among the wealthy countries,
nor is it the case that all of the wealthy countries exhibit convergence.
In contrast to the conventional wisdom, convergence among the relatively developed
countries is far from a robust phenomenon (Ben-David, 1995). Some countries converge with
others, but not with the remainder. Other countries converge with yet different countries, but also
not with most. In short, a random grouping of the more developed countries will not yield
income convergence in more instances than it will yield non-convergence.
Thus, if one focuses on the non-poor countries, can a thread be found that ties together
the groups of converging countries in a manner that distinguishes them from the larger array of
non-convergence groups? This paper explores the contribution of international trade to the
convergence process.
Why should greater openness between countries be related to income convergence
between them? The traditional trade and traditional growth theories do not provide much
guidance in this regard.

From the perspective of traditional trade theory, the factor price

equalization proposition shows how

when certain restrictions are met

free trade can lead to

the equalization of factor prices. But this does not necessarily imply the equalization of incomes.
From the perspective of traditional growth theory, the Solow model can yield income
convergence, but this occurs within a closed economy framework without the need for trade. The
more recent endogenous growth models that deal with trade concentrate primarily on explaining
steady state growth rates and there is little emphasis on explaining convergence in levels.

1

So what might be the intuition underlying the possible link between trade and
convergence? It is probably not unreasonable to assume that greater openness is related to
increased competition, both at home and abroad, for domestic firms. The resultant sink or swim
environment makes it crucial for affected firms to absorb foreign knowledge and ideas. Hence,
greater openness is presumably tied to increased knowledge spillovers between countries. To the
extent that knowledge levels among countries converge to a common level, then intuition
suggests that this might lead to a convergence in the developmental levels of countries as well.
Grossman and Helpman (1991) and others have used the size of trade volumes as a proxy for the
extent of knowledge spillovers between countries. Ben-David and Loewy (1998) incorporate this
intuition into a model that details both the transitional, as well as the steady state, impact of trade
policy on convergence and growth in per capita output. The model shows how movement
towards free trade leads to higher trade volumes between the liberalizing countries, a reduction
in income differentials among the liberalizers, and to faster growth.
This paper focuses on the empirical facets of this issue by examining 127 country pairs
created on the basis of exports, and 134 country pairs created on the basis of imports. In each
case there will be a source country that is paired with one of its major trade partners. The goal
will be to examine how changes in trade relationships over time can lead to changes in the
degree of income disparity among countries.
The following section provides some background and discusses related studies. Section
three details the relationship between changes in trade and changes in the rate of convergence
within trade-based groups of countries.

Section four focuses on the trade-convergence

relationship within a bilateral setting. Section five concludes.

II. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
The upsurge in growth-related research in the past decade has included a number of
important contributions that have focused on the relationship between international trade and
output growth and convergence. Work that is directly related to the analysis below includes Coe
and Helpman (1995), for example, who focus on the impact of R&D spillovers on productivity
growth.

They find that a country’s productivity levels are affected not only by its own

investments in R&D, but also on the investments made by its trade partners. Keller (1996)
disputes the importance of the bilateral trade relationships in the Coe and Helpman study, though
his other work (Keller, 1997) also concludes that there does appear to be a general spillover
effect emanating from foreign R&D. Dollar (1992), Edwards (1993), Harrison (1995), Sachs and
Warner (1995), and Henrekson, Torstensson and Torstensson (1996) focus directly on the impact
of trade openness on economic growth and find a positive relationship between the two.
This study extends past research by Ben-David on the relationship between international
trade and income convergence. The issue of causality (i.e. is it the increased trade that causes
income convergence, or is it increasing income similarity between countries that causes increased
trade?) was explored during the initial phase of the research by establishing evidence on the
existence of the link between trade agreements and convergence. By choosing a small number
of countries that decided to formally liberalize trade, Ben-David (1993) was able to examine the
degree of disparity prior to, during, and following the implementation of the trade reforms. In
each of these instances, no income convergence was apparent during the decades prior to the
reduction of trade barriers. As the countries began their liberalization, income gaps began to fall,
and they continued to remain below the pre-liberalization levels in the years following the end
of the reform process.

3

To the extent that these agreements to liberalize trade are viewed as exogenous events,
this result is important, for it provides support for the hypothesis that it is the movement towards
freer trade that led to the convergence and not the other way around. Different groups that
embarked on liberalization at different times began to converge during their respective time
frames and not earlier or later.
This research on the impact of trade liberalization on incomes also showed a strong
positive relationship between the degree of openness and the volume of trade. For example, the
United States and Canada instituted a series of major trade reform measures between 1965 and
1973. These began with the implementation of the auto agreement between the two countries
in 1965 and continued with much broader reforms during the years 1968 through 1973 as the
Kennedy Round agreements were implemented (Preeg, 1970).
As is indicated in Figure 1, the liberalization of trade between the two countries had a
marked effect on trade between the two. The figure plots the ratio of bilateral trade to total GDP
of the two countries between 1948 and 1988 as well as the average trade-output ratio for the prereform period (1948-1965) and the average trade-output ratio for the post-reform period, (19741988). Trade grew at roughly the same rate as output prior to the reductions in trade barriers in
1965. The liberalization was accompanied by a substantial increase in trade. Upon completion
of the Kennedy Round reforms, the trade ratio stabilized once again

at a level nearly twice the

pre-reform level.
The formation of the European Economic Community (EEC) in the late 1950’s and its
expansion in the early 1970’s provides another example of the impact that trade reforms may
have on the volume of trade. The six founding countries of the EEC began to liberalize trade

4

with one another over a decade before the Community was actually formalized.1 Marshall Plan
aid in the late 1940’s was tied to the implementation of trade reforms. The reforms continued
throughout the 1950s with the signing of the additional agreements between the six original EEC
countries and culminated in the formation of the Economic Community which implemented a
series of further tariff and quota reductions. By the early 1970s, most trade barriers between the
countries were gone, and as the top panel in Figure 2 shows, the trade-output ratio
substantially until then

which rose

leveled off.

In 1973, the Community expanded with the inclusion of three new members.2 EEC
imports from the three countries prior to their inclusion into the Community (shown in the middle
panel of Figure 2) was relatively constant. The import-output ratio rose steadily following
membership in 1973. And finally, for comparison purposes, imports from the United States,
which was not a partner to the Community’s liberalization measures, did not display the kind of
changes that the liberalizations rendered the partner countries. The bottom panel in Figure 2
shows that EEC imports from the U.S. remained fairly stable throughout the postwar period.
While there are clearly many other factors that effect the extent of trade between
countries, trade liberalization appears to be a primary contributor in this regard. As the above
examples indicate, prior to, following, and in lieu of trade reforms, there is very little evidence
of substantial change in the extent of trade between countries. On the other hand, as countries
become more open, the extent of openness is reflected in the extent of trade between them. This
relationship will be utilized within the context of the following question: what kind of an effect

can the extent of openness, which will be proxied for here by the extent of trade, have on the
degree of income disparity between countries?
Ben-David (1996) examined the liberalization-convergence link by focusing on non-poor
countries (which were defined as countries with per capita incomes of at least 25% of the United
States, the lead country in 1960). For each of the resultant 25 source countries
be referred to here

as they will

an export-based group was created that included all countries importing at

least 4% of the source country’s exports. Similarly, a 4% cutoff point was used to determine
each source country’s import-based group.3
By grouping together countries that are major trade partners of one another, the study
showed a very high incidence of income convergence within the trade-based groups. As a
reference point for determining the uniqueness of the trade-based convergence results, the same
countries comprising the trade-based groups were grouped and regrouped repeatedly on a random
basis and did not exhibit a prevalence of convergence outcomes

supporting the earlier results

that, while convergence may be found among the more developed countries, it is more of an
infrequent finding than a frequent one.
These earlier studies by Ben-David established that grouping countries according to crosssectional trade criteria (at a given point in time) produces convergence results considerably more
often than do random grouping of countries. What is still not clear, however, is why some trade
groups converged faster than others. That issue is the focus of this paper. It delves deeper into
the trade-convergence relationship by asking whether changes in the extent of trade over time
between any set of countries are related to changes in the extent of income convergence over

criteria may be found in Ben-David (1996).

time between these countries.

In other words, did trade-based groups of countries that

substantially increased their trade over a 26 year period also experience faster rates of
convergence than those trade-based groups that only marginally increased their trade?

III. INTRA-GROUP CONVERGENCE
One possible way to examine this question is to calculate the ratio of each group’s total
internal trade to the group’s total GDP and determine whether this ratio is related to the group’s
convergence coefficient (which Ben-David, 1996, denotes as φ). A negative relationship might
be interpreted as an indication that heightened trade coincides with income convergence.
The main problem with a test of this kind is that small countries tend to trade a much
larger fraction of their incomes than do large countries.

Therefore, any cross-sectional

relationship between a group’s trade ratio and its convergence coefficient might reflect the
preponderance of small countries within groups rather than a trade-convergence relationship.
An alternative way to examine the magnitude of trade’s impact on convergence would be
to look at each group individually and examine the behavior of its intra-group trade as well as
the behavior of its intra-group income differentials over time, and then to determine the extent
of the relationship between the two.
The total volume of intra-group trade was calculated for each of the 25 export-based and
25 import-based trade groups, for each of the years between 1960 and 1985.4 To get a measure
of how intra-group trade grew (if at all) relative to the group’s total output, the total intra-group
trade was divided by the group’s aggregate GDPs.5 This ratio, represented by the variable Rik,t

(where i is the group’s source country and k identifies the group as being import-based or exportbased) was calculated for each of the 50 groups for each of the 26 years.
In Equation (1), each group i’s trade ratio at time t is regressed on trend (Tt).
(1)

As is evident from the results in Table 1, these ratios were found to have increased significantly
over time for every one of the groups. The question is, were these increases larger for the groups
that converged the fastest?
Groups exhibiting convergence would be expected to have declining standard deviations
(σik,t) while diverging groups should have increasing standard deviations.6 These are in fact the
results from an estimation of Equation (2),
(2)

where each of those groups found to be converging in Ben-David (1996) display significantly
negative trend coefficients in Table 2.
k
The trend coefficients on the trade ratios (α2,i
) and the trend coefficients on the income
k
differentials (β2,i
) provide an indication of the magnitude of the change in each variable during

the specified time period. A relationship between the two trend coefficients, in the form of
(3)

should provide some evidence of whether groups that had the largest increases in trade (that is,
k
k
the largest α2,i
) were also those that converged the fastest (i.e. had the most negative β2,i
).

Isolating α2,i
in Equation (1) and β2,i
in Equation (2) and then substituting these values

into Equation (3) yields

where

.

To eliminate the need to explicitly account for fixed effects,

Equation (4) is differenced, yielding
(5)

where Dxki,t is the log difference between xki,t and xki,t-1 for x = {σ, R}. The sign of λ1k, which was
the trend coefficient in Equation (4), indicates income convergence (if negative) or divergence
(if positive) within the groups.

Since aggregate output appears in the numerator used in

calculating σik,t and in the denominator of the trade ratios, Rik,t, the differenced lagged variable,
DRik,t-2 is used instead to avoid an overlap of the periods.7
The data for the 25 trade-based groups is pooled (once for the exports and once for the
imports) and Equation (5) is estimated. The results appear in Table 3. The significantly negative
intercept, for both the export and the import estimations, indicates that the trade groups exhibit
income convergence

which is consistent with the convergence results from Ben-David (1996).

The addition here is λ2 the estimated coefficient for the variable DR which measures the
contribution of changes in intra-group trade towards changes in intra-group disparity. These
estimated coefficients for the trade ratios are significantly negative for both exports and imports.

Specifically, since Dσik,t includes σik,t-1 and DRik,t-1 includes Rik,t-1, then an overlap would exist for period t 1. Hence
DRik,t-2 is used in Equation (5).

The implication of a negative λ2 is that increases in the extent of trade lead to further reductions
in the income differentials among the trade group members.

IV. BILATERAL CONVERGENCE
Rather than focus on the trade groups in their entirety, it is possible to add a measure of
precision to the analysis by focusing on the bilateral relationships between each of the source
countries with each of their primary trade partners. The volume of bilateral trade between each
source country i and each of its primary trade partners (j) is divided by the source country’s total
GDP. The log of this ratio, Rikj,t, is calculated for each of the 127 export-based pairs of countries
and each of the 134 import-based pairs for each of the 25 years. The income gaps, Gikj,t (which
now replace σik,t in the analysis), measure the annual differences of the logs of real GDP per
worker between each source country and each of their main partners. In the event that the source
country is wealthier, then Gikj,t is positive. Otherwise, it is negative. Pairs exhibiting convergence
would be expected to have declining income gaps (in absolute terms) while diverging groups
should have increasing gaps.8
The version of Equation (5) estimated in the bilateral case is

8

Note that, while country j might be one of country i’s primary import partners, it is also possible that country i is
a primary import partner of country j (with a similar type of overlap possible for export pairs as well). There are
25 such instances of overlap in the import case and 27 in the export case. In these instances of overlap, the
numerator of Rikj,t will be the same as the numerator of Rjki,t. Not so the denominator, which reflects the source
country’s aggregate output level. Hence, Rikj,t≠Rjki,t and in the analysis that follows, all of the import and export-based
pairs are used. However, to the extent that the inclusion of all pairs leads to any bias in the outcomes, each of the
following tests was rerun twice more: once with just one-half of the overlapping pairs, and then again with the other
half of the overlapping pairs. None of the results reported below are sensitive to these omissions, hence only the
overall results are reported.

10

(6)

where the variable DUMijk equals unity if the initial level of income of the source country is
greater than that of its partner country, i.e the income gap is positive. DUMijk equals zero when
the initial income gap is negative.
The baseline case in Equation (6) is one where the source country is initially poorer than
its partner country, i.e. DUMijk=0. When the income gaps are negative, convergence is indicated
when the gap become less negative over time. That is, λ1 should be positive in the event of
convergence. The opposite is true for instances when the source country is wealthier (DUMijk=1).
In this case, convergence is indicated when the gap falls over time and the sum (λ1+η1) is
negative.

To the extent that increased trade intensifies the convergence process, then the

expected signs would be λ2 > 0 and (λ2+η2) < 0.
Equation (6) is estimated for all of the 127 country pairs based on exports and all of the
134 pairs based on imports. The results are reported in lines 1 and 4 of Table 4. Since there
are a sizable number of country pairs characterized by income gaps that are always positive
or always negative

throughout the entire sample period, it is possible to re-estimate Equation

(6) separately for the positive-gaps-only cases and the negative-gaps-only cases. In these cases,
given the uniformity of the sign of the dependent variable, the equation can be estimated without
the need for dummies. The results of these estimations in the export case are reported in lines
2 and 3, while the import results appear in lines 5 and 6.
For both exports and imports, the intercepts (λ1) are significantly positive for negative
income gaps and significantly negative (λ1+η1) for pairs of countries with positive income gaps
which implies that the bilateral income gaps between the trade partners are falling over time.

11

These results are also evident in the negative-gaps-only cases as well as in the positive-gaps-only
cases, for both exports and imports. Thus, the results from these estimations support the earlier
outcomes that countries that trade extensively with one another exhibit significant convergence.
Does an increase in these already large trade flows lead to an increase in the speed of
income convergence? Recall that in the case of negative income gaps, a positive λ2 indicates that
increases in the trade-output ratios lead to less negative income gaps

i.e. faster convergence.

In line 2, when the source country remains poorer throughout the sample period, increased
exports by the poorer source country to the wealthier partner country significantly speed up the
convergence process. When the source country is the wealthier of the two, the results reported
in line 6 indicate that increased imports by the wealthier source country lead to significantly
faster convergence

a result that corroborates the findings in line 2 (which represent the flip side

of the same coin). In short, increasing the flow of trade from the poorer country to the wealthier
country (be they the poorer source country’s exports or the wealthier source country’s imports)
speeds up the convergence process.
The results regarding trade flows in the other direction are not as conclusive. On the one
hand, there are the results from line 3 indicating that increased exports by the wealthier source
country in fact widen the income gap, or at least act to diminish the convergence that is reflected
in the intercept. On the other hand, the results in line 5 provide weak evidence (they are not
significant) that when the poorer source country increases its imports, the income gap falls
further. These two outcomes are not consistent with one another. Furthermore, an examination

12

of the mixed gap estimations in lines 1 and 4 also do not suggest a significant contribution of
trade flowing from the wealthier country to the poorer country.9
There is a problem, however, with the above estimations of Equation (6) and it has to do
with the independence of the observations. Specifically, each source country has more than one
major trade partner and many of the major partners of one country are also major trade partners
of additional countries. Since Gij,t = yi,t

yj,t, where yi,t is the log output per worker in country

i, then any two error terms such as vij,t and vik,t, which are both related to country i, might be
correlated. In the event that the error terms are correlated, then the estimated standard errors of
the coefficients are inconsistent

though the estimated coefficients themselves are consistent.

One way to avoid this problem would be to estimate Equation (6) using a subsample of country
pairs in which each country would appear no more than once. The question is: which country
pairs should be chosen and how might it be possible to determine whether the results of the
estimations described in Table 4 are really representative of the bilateral convergence process?
The country selection algorithm adopted here is as follows. The first source country, i,
is chosen randomly from the list of 25 source countries. A partner country, j, is then chosen
randomly from the list of i’s major trade partners. Having selected the first pair, countries i and
j are removed from the list of available countries (for future selections). The selection process
is then repeated for the next pair of countries. As the list of selected pairs begins to grow, some
source countries may be chosen for whom all of the trade partners have already been selected.
These countries are then also omitted from the sample of available source countries. This process

9

Recall that not all of the source countries are major trade partners and not all of the major trade partners are source
countries. Hence there is room for discrepancies in comparisons of results for poorer source country exports vs
wealthier source country imports and for poorer source country imports vs wealthier source country exports.

13

continues until the last source country
country

for whom there remains at least one available partner

is chosen.

This selection algorithm yields a sample size of between 8 and 13 pairs of countries, each
of them different. If the selection process is repeated often enough, and Equation (6) is estimated
each time, it then becomes possible to examine the distribution of each coefficient and to
determine the degree of accuracy of the findings reported in Table 4.
Herein lies another issue. How closely do draws averaging 11 pairs per sample reflect
the 100+ import and export pairs that represent all of the major bilateral trade relationships
between the non-poor countries? In other words, a country like the United States, which is a
major export partner in 24 out of the 127 export-based pairs (or 19% of the pairs) can only
appear once in each sample, either as a partner, or alternatively, as a source country. Thus, it
will appear in only one of the roughly 11 trade pairs that are randomly drawn. On the other
hand, a country like New Zealand, which is a major export partner of only one other country
(Australia) has a higher probability of being included in the random samplings than in the overall
group of pairs.
This is illustrated in Figure 3, which provides a comparison between the squares (which
represent the actual number of appearances as a percentage of the total number of pairs, 127) and
the triangles (which represent the number of appearances in 1000 sample draws of all possible
pairs). Countries that appear often as major trade partners are under-represented in the random
sampling while countries that appear less frequently as major trade partners tend to get overrepresented in the sample draws. By truncating the random sampling process at 4 pairs per
sample (represented by the diamonds in the figure), it is possible to get pairings that more closely
resemble the actual frequency of appearance.

14

Thus, Equation (6) is estimated for each of 1000 random truncated samplings of four
pairs. The cumulative distribution of each of the estimated coefficients for the export-based pairs
appears in the four panels of Figure 4. The non-zero vertical lines are drawn at the values of the
overall export estimation that appear in line 1 in Table 4. As is evident in the figures, the
estimated coefficients in Table 4 are fairly close to the median of the plotted distributions. This
is also the case for imports in Figure 5.
Moreover, the number of coefficients that are significantly different from zero at the 10
percent level

listed in Table 4 in the two lines below each of the Equation (6) estimations

also tends to corroborate the overall estimation results. Recall that for negative income gaps,
convergence requires positive signs for λ1 and λ2 while in the case of positive income gaps, the
required signs for η1 and η2 are negative.
Starting first with the intercept
among these bilateral trade pairs

which provides an overall indication of convergence
in the case of exports, 343 of the estimated λ1’s are

significantly positive while only 37 are significantly negative. The estimated η1’s on the other
hand, are mainly negative. The results are similar for the similar-gap estimations of lines 2 and
3 as well as for the three import estimations. In other words, there appears to be very strong
evidence of convergence among the trade-based pairs of countries.
As for the question of the relationship between increases in the extent of trade and
increases in the speed of convergence, the evidence from the random groupings provides support
for the relatively strong earlier findings that increased trade flows from the poorer country to the
wealthier country increase the speed of convergence between the two. The evidence from the
random groupings also provides support for the earlier findings of an ambiguous impact of
increased trade flows from the wealthier country to poorer country.

15

V. CONCLUSION
This paper focused on the relationship between trade and income convergence over time.
Changes in the extent of trade (among heavy traders) appear to have an effect on the degree of
income disparity among countries.

Increases in intra-group trade intensified the speed of

convergence among the group members.
Breaking up the groups into the individual pairings of source and partner countries serves
to sharpen the findings. The bilateral pairs continue to exhibit significant convergence

be they

export-based or import-based pairs. Increased trade by the countries appears to further strengthen
the convergence when the flow being increased is from the poorer partner to the wealthier
partner. This result holds irrespective of whether the source country is the wealthier or poorer
trade partner.

Increased trade flows in the other direction, however, do not appear to be

conclusively related to changes in income convergence.
