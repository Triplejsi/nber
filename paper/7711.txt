ABSTRACT
This paper uses an updated and revised panel data set on ambient air pollution in cities worldwide to examine the robustness of the evidence for the existence of an inverted U-shaped
relationship between national income and pollution. We test the sensitivity of the pollution-income
relationship to functional forms, to additional covariates, and to changes in the nations, cities, and
years sampled. We find that the results are highly sensitive to these changes. We conclude that there
is little empirical support for an inverted-U-shaped relationship between several important air
pollutants and national income in these data.

1. Introduction
Several recent and often-cited papers on the relationship between pollution and economic
growth find that many forms of air and water pollution "initially worsen but then improve as incomes rise"
(World Bank, 1992). Grossman and Krueger (1995), in particular, report that for most pollutants, this
turning point in environmental quality typically occurs at incomes below $8000 per capita. Because of its
similarity to the pattern of income inequality documented by Kuznets (1955), this inverse-U-shaped
pollution-income pattern is sometimes called an "environmental Kuznets curve."
In response to these empirical findings, a number of researchers have sought further evidence
for inverse-U-shaped pollution-income relationships (Holtz-Eakin and Selden, 1995; Selden and Song,
1994; Hilton and Levinson, 1998; Shafik, 1994). Others have proposed theoretical explanations for the
relationship between pollution and economic growth (Selden and Song, 1995; Stokey, 1998; Jaeger,
1998; Jones and Manuelli, 1995; Andreoni and Levinson, 1998; Chaudhuri and Pfaff, 1997).1 There
are essentially two key questions being asked. The first is whether or not an inverted-U-shaped
pollution-income path can be consistent with Pareto optimality. This is the subject of much of the
theoretical literature. The second key question is whether there is sufficient empirical evidence to
conclude that environmental quality does improve eventually with economic growth, for at least some
subset of pollutants. This latter question is the focus of this paper. While the existing literature appears to
demonstrate numerous circumstances in which pollution follows an inverse-U, eventually declining with
income, we argue that the evidence is less robust than it appears.
Far from being an academic curiosity, this debate is of considerable importance to national and
international environmental policy. Based on the existing research, some policy analysts have concluded

2

that developing countries will automatically become cleaner as their economies grow (Beckerman,
1992; Bartlett, 1994). Others have argued that it is natural for the poorest countries to become more
polluted as they develop. These types of conclusions depend on the apparently growing conventional
wisdom that pollution follows a deterministic inverse-U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve.
In this paper we re-examine the empirical evidence documenting inverse-U-shaped pollutionincome relationships using the air pollution data studied by the World Bank (1992) and by Grossman
and Krueger (1995), with the benefits of a retrospective data cleaning and ten additional years of data.
We analyze three common air pollutants: sulfur dioxide (SO2), smoke, and total suspended particulates
(TSP). These are the three pollutants for which the most complete data are available.2 All three are
widely considered to cause serious health and environmental problems. Two of the three, SO2 and
smoke, exhibit the most dramatic inverse-U-shaped patterns in the World Bank (1992) and in
Grossman and Krueger (1995). We also test the sensitivity of the pollution-income relationship to the
functional forms and econometric specifications used, to the inclusion of additional covariates besides
income, and to the nations, cities, and years sampled. In addition, we construct 95-percent confidence
bands around the estimated pollution-income relationships.
Our conclusion is that the evidence for an inverted-U is much less robust than previously
thought. We find that the locations of the turning points, as well as their very existence, are sensitive to
both slight variations in the data and to reasonable permutations of the econometric specification.
Merely cleaning up the data, or including newly available observations, makes the inverse-U shape
disappear. Furthermore, econometric specifications that extend the lag structure of GDP per capita as a

dependent variable, include additional country-specific covariates, or include country-level fixed effects,
generate predicted pollution-income relationships with very different shapes.

2. Data
The data on ambient pollution levels underlying this study are collected by the Global
Environmental Monitoring System (GEMS), sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and
the United Nations.3 The EPA maintains these data in its Aerometric Information Retrieval System
(AIRS). For each pollution monitoring station, the data set we obtained contains the annual mean and
maximum for each pollutant monitored, along with descriptive variables about the neighborhood and city
in which the monitor is located.
Table 1 lists some descriptive statistics for both the original data used by Grossman and
Krueger (1995), which they have graciously made available, and for the data available from AIRS as of
December 1998. The new data contain substantially more usable observations than were originally
available. For sulfur dioxide, the number of observations goes from 1352 to 2381, with 25 new cities,
and three new countries. These data add 4 new years of observations, from 1989 to 1992, and 6
additional years of older observations, from 1971 to 1976. In addition, missing observations for existing
cities have been filled in.
The new AIRS data also include revisions of some of the original observations. To determine
the extent of these revisions, we matched the observations from the original data with those in the new
data, and then compared the pollution concentration numbers. These matches were not always easy to
make. We began by matching observations between the two data sets by pollutant, city, and year. In
most cases there were several monitoring sites per city, so observations were then paired by comparing

4

the number of measurements and mean values reported. For some cities the number of observations
was consistently the same, for others it was consistently different, and for still others it was a mix.
Using our best efforts to match the old and the new observations, we found that observations
that appeared to come from the same site and year often had very different reported pollution
concentrations. We also found that 92 of 1021 observations in the original TSP data were obvious
duplications, as were 76 of the 488 in the smoke data. These have been eliminated from the new data
set. Table 2 gives summary statistics showing the extent of the revisions. For the 485 SO2 observations
that we are most certain that we have correctly matched to the original data set, the correlation between
mean sulfur dioxide levels between the new and old data is only 0.75. For TSP and smoke this
correlation is 1.0 and 0.77 respectively. The lower part of Table 2 shows summary statistics for the
ratio of the new reported observation value to the value in the old data. If the data were identical, the
mean of this ratio would be one, and the standard deviation would be zero. For SO2 the mean of this
ratio is 1.21, while the standard deviation is 1.73. In sum, since some of the early empirical work on this
topic was completed, a large number of new observations have been added, and the existing data have
been substantially revised. We should also note that the matching procedure we followed probably
produces a downward biased picture of the extent of these revisions, because we are most likely to
match the observations that have not changed.
In the analyses that follow, we examine the data on ambient concentrations of SO2, TSP, and
smoke together with a set of variables describing national income, political structure, investment, trade,
and population density, as well as control variables that account for where the monitoring station was
located. For national income we use real per capita gross domestic product, in 1985 dollars, from the
Penn World Tables (PWT) as described in Summers and Heston (1991). This is the same income
3

GEMS was initiated in the early 1970s to coordinate the worldwide collection of comparable measures of ambient air

5

measure used by most previous studies. Our measure of political structure is an index of the extent of
democratic participation in government, from the Polity III data set described in Jaggers and Gurr
(1995). This index, which ranges from 0 to 10 with 10 being most democratic, is available for every
year and country in the AIRS data. We measure trade intensity using the ratio of imports plus exports to
GDP, and we measure investment as a fraction of GDP, both from the PWT. We use population and
country area data from a variety of sources to construct annual measures of national population density.4

3. The effects of changes in the data
To demonstrate the effects of the revisions to the existing data, we need to begin with a
benchmark econometric specification. Because Grossman and Krueger's (1995) paper is in many ways
the most carefully done and widely known work, we start with their specification. They estimate

Yit = Git β1 + Git2 β2 + Git3 β3 + Lit β4 + L2it β5 + L3it β6 + X it' β7 + µi + ν it ,

where Git is per capita gross domestic product at time t for the country in which monitoring site i is
located, Lit is a three-year average of lagged per capita GDP, and Xit are country and site-specific
descriptors. This model was estimated using random effects, so mi is assumed to be a site specific effect
that is uncorrelated with the right-hand-side variables, and nit is a normally distributed error term.
Table 3 estimates this equation for SO2. Column 1 replicates the Grossman and Krueger results
exactly, using their data. The dependent variable in column 1 is the median annual sulfur dioxide reading
from each monitor. Because the version of the data we obtained from the EPA reports mean values
and water quality. See Bennet et al. (1985) and UNEP and WHO (1983), (1984), (1992) and (1994) for reports on the
history and results of the GEMS air monitoring project.

6

rather than medians, in column 2 we report results from an identical specification substituting means for
medians, again using the original data. This difference in the dependent variable seems unimportant: the
pattern of coefficient signs, sizes, and statistical significance remains largely unchanged.
Figure 1 plots the predicted pollution-income paths with all regressors other than income set at
their means.5 Line 1 in Figure 1 plots the results of column 1 of Table 1. Line 2 uses mean values from
column 2, rather than the medians from column 1. The second line is virtually identical to the first, though
it is somewhat higher due to the fact that the pollution data are skewed, with means higher than medians.
Both plots peak at about $4000 per capita. Because the most recent public release of AIRS data
contains only mean pollution readings, in the rest of the analysis we use means, relying on the
comparison of columns 1 and 2 to show that the difference is insubstantial.
Column 3 of Table 3 uses the same sample of cities and years as columns 1 and 2, 1977 to
1988, but incorporates the corrections and additions in the latest release of the AIRS data. Since the
earlier release contained missing descriptive statistics, the regressions in columns 1 and 2 contain an
indicator variable for the cases when covariates were unavailable. The most recent data contain no such
gaps, and so we drop the corresponding indicator variable. Similarly, we dropped a variable
documenting the type of pollution monitor, available in the original data but not in the new version.6 As
can be seen from Table 3, even using the same observations and econometric specification, the changes
in the data result in large changes in the regression results and the shape of the GDP/SO2 relationship.
Line 3 of Figure 1 depicts these differences. Rather than increasing and then peaking at $4,000, line 3
declines initially, then starts to increase at about $7,000, at nearly the same point where the second

For the fixed effect models reported below, this amounts to a measure of population, since area does not vary with
time.

In drawing this and subsequent figures, we have set lagged GDP equal to current GDP, as was done in Grossman
and Krueger (1995), and for consistency we use the same method to calculate the peaks and troughs given in the
tables.

This variable was not significant in any of the original specifications.

7

regression line was actually decreasing at its highest rate. The line then starts to decrease again at about
$14,000, about where the second regression line starts to increase.
Column 4 in Table 3 uses the most recent AIRS data, and all available observations from 1971
to 1992. The individual GDP coefficients are generally highly significantly different from zero, which is
not true of all of the preceding regressions, perhaps due to the increase in sample size. Again, the
estimated pollution-income equations change significantly from those fit using the original data, though
the changes from column 3 are minor. Line 4 of Figure 1 plots the predicted values from column 4. The
difference in the shape of the curve is insubstantial.
For the other air pollutants we studied, TSP and smoke, there were fewer changes to the data
and therefore the regression results are less sensitive to those changes. (See Appendix Table 1.) In both
the original and new data, TSP decreases monotonically with GDP, although the slopes at $10,000 and
$12,000 are smaller in the new data. For smoke, in both the original and new data the pollution
concentrations exhibit an inverted-U, with a peak at about $6,000.
Finally, the last line of Table 3 presents chi-squared statistics from a Hausman test of whether
the random-effects error terms are uncorrelated across the monitoring stations. In three of the four
samples, this hypothesis can be rejected, suggesting that fixed monitoring-station effects are more
appropriate. Therefore, in the next section we use the most recent version of the AIRS data with a fixed
effects model to explore the effects of changing the econometric specification of the pollution-income
relationship.

8

4. The effects of changes in the specification
Because the reduced form relationships typically estimated in this literature are not driven by any
particular economic model, there is little theoretical guidance for the correct specification. Consequently,
we believe the best approach is to see if conclusions are robust across a variety of specifications. Table
4 summarizes the results of regressions for SO2 using fixed monitoring-station effects with different
covariates and functional forms. All these regressions use the most complete version of the data
available to us, the same as that used in column 4 of Table 3. Column 1 of Table 4 is a fixed-effects
version of the regression in column 4 of Table 3, excluding those regressors that do not vary over time.7
The results are comparable, suggesting that although a Hausman test may reject the random-effects
specification, in practice the predicted pollution income paths from the two models are comparable.
In column 2 we lengthen the lag structure of the income variable. Lagged values of GDP per
capita, averaged over the previous three years, were included in the original specifications as a measure
of permanent income. In other words, pollution is almost certainly positively correlated with temporary
changes in GDP, as increases and decreases in economic activity generate more or less pollution. Of
more interest are the effects of long-run secular changes in income, which may increase or decrease
pollution levels, depending on the sources of economic growth and on the nature of any induced policy
responses. If, for example, wealthier policymakers enact more stringent pollution regulations, then the
effect of permanent income on GDP may be negative. To separate these two effects more distinctly, in
column 2 we use a polynomial in the average GDP per capita for the past 10 years, rather than the 3year lag in the original specification. These longer lags eliminate more of the temporary fluctuations from
the measure of permanent income. They also provide more time for secular changes in GDP to become
incorporated in social values, for those social values to be used to determine government policy, and

9

then for those policy changes to be implemented. Comparing columns 1 and 2 of Table 4, these longer
lags do not dramatically alter the regression results.
Column 3 of Table 4 adds a number of covariates to the specification. First, it adds the square
of the time trend to measure nonlinearities in the time path of pollution. If environmental degradation or
improvement has accelerated over time for reasons unrelated to GDP growth, and if the econometric
models include only a linear time trend, the acceleration may be inaccurately attributed to GDP changes.
Column 3 also includes a measure of national trade intensity, an index of democratic
government, relative GDP (national GDP divided by the average of all countries' GDPs), and the
percentage of GDP going to investment. All are statistically significant, with the exception of relative
GDP. Including all of these additional covariates alters the magnitude of the coefficients on the GDP
polynomials, though not their general pattern.
In column 4 of Table 4, we include only trade intensity and the democracy index as additional
covariates. In column 5 we substitute annual year indicators for the year quadratic, allowing even more
flexibility in the aggregate time pattern of pollution. Neither change yields dramatic changes to the
pattern of GDP coefficients nor to the predicted pollution-income path.
Finally, in columns 6 and 7 of Table 4, we estimate models in which the dependent variable is
the log of the mean annual pollution reading at each monitoring station, rather than the level. Though the
pattern of the GDP coefficients' signs are similar to those in levels regression, in columns 6 and 7 the
measured effect of changes in income on pollution levels virtually disappears (even after re-scaling
pollution from logs to levels).

7

Column 1 also replaces the time-invariant city-level measure of population density with an annual national-level
measure.

10

Although there is no a priori reason to prefer any one of the specifications in Table 4 to the
others, the specifications generally show a U-shaped, rather than inverted U-shaped relationship
between income and sulfur dioxide pollution. This finding is troubling, for two reasons. First, if we
assume that when GDP is zero pollution must also be zero, then we know that the true pollution-income
relationship cannot be U-shaped. Second, even though the pattern of coefficients is similar across
specifications in Table 4, the slopes at any particular income and the location of the turning points vary
considerably. As a consequence, we feel that we can say very little about any underlying relationship
between GDP and ambient levels of SO2.
This conclusion, that we can conclude little about pollution-income patterns, holds even more
strongly for smoke and TSP. For these pollutants, we ran various specifications with the new AIRS
data, in a way similar to what we show in Tables 3 and 4 for SO2. (See Appendix Table 2 for the
results, and Appendix Figures 1 and 2 for the plots of those results.) For smoke and TSP the predicted
pollution-income paths have inverted-U-shapes, though the location and magnitudes of the peaks
depend on the specification.
Another means of demonstrating the uncertainty about the GDP-pollution relationship is to draw
confidence bands around the entire predicted path, rather than around individual coefficients. Since the
underlying variables, GDP, its polynomial, and lagged values, are correlated, the confidence bands will
be wider than might be inferred from the coefficients' standard errors. One approach would be to use
the joint confidence interval for all of the coefficients, not just the GDP coefficients. This approach might
be appropriate if we were interested in possible pollution paths for a country for which we knew the
values of the independent variables, but not the current pollution level. A second approach would be to
draw confidence bands for the future path of pollution, starting at current GDP, and assuming that we
know current pollution levels with certainty. This would result in a much narrower confidence band. We

11

compromise between these two approaches and ignore the uncertainty in all of the coefficients aside
from the GDP polynomials, including the intercept, and start at a GDP of zero.
Figure 2 depicts the confidence band for Grossman and Krueger’s (1995) SO2 specification,
column 1 of Table 3. These bands are based on bootstrapped 95 percent joint confidence intervals for
the GDP and lagged GDP polynomials. To interpret Figure 2, assume that the specification in column 1
of Table 3 is correct. In that case, we can say with 95 percent certainty that the "true" pollution-income
cubic equation falls within the indicated region. These confidence bands are obviously wide enough to
incorporate a variety of paths over the relevant range of GDP. We may have monotonically rising or
falling pollution, U-shapes or inverted-U-shapes, or more complicated relationships. Of course, the
confidence region shown assumes that the true relationship between GDP and pollution is the cubic
functional form estimated. If this is not correct, the true confidence band could be even wider.
Figure 3 depicts the 95 percent confidence band for the fixed-effects regression from column 4
of Table 4, constructed in a similar manner. Uncertainty about the shape of the pollution-income path is
equally apparent here. A variety of pollution-income paths may be described within the region depicted.
For smoke and TSP, the GDP coefficients have higher standard errors and the confidence bands (not
shown here) are wider than in the Figure 3 SO2 regressions.

5. Conclusion
In sum, for three important air pollutants, SO2, smoke, and TSP, we find that the estimated
relationship between pollution and GDP is sensitive to both sample and empirical specification. We
believe that, for these pollutants, there is little if any empirical support for the existence of an inverted-Ushaped "environmental Kuznets curve." However, we believe this statement deserves at least two
qualifications.

12

First, there are theoretical arguments, such as those cited in our introduction, which suggest that
an inverted-U-shaped relationship may not only be possible, but in fact may be quite plausible. It may
well be the case that the existing data on a few pollutants, drawn from a few monitoring stations in a
small non-representative sample of cities over a relatively short period of time, is simply insufficient to
detect the true relationship between pollution and economic growth, should that be an inverted U.
Alternatively, most of the world's nations may not yet have reached income levels sufficient to generate
the turning points predicted by those theories.
The second point worth highlighting here is that while this paper shows that air quality does not
necessarily improve with economic growth, we have found no evidence in these data that environmental
quality necessarily declines with growth either. Our conclusion is simply that, for these pollutants, the
available empirical evidence cannot be used to support either the proposition that economic growth
helps the environment, or the proposition that it harms the environment.

The expected mean of the ratio is 1 if the data has not been altered and if our pairing is correct.

The expected standard deviation of the ratio is 0 if the data has not been altered and if our pairing is
correct.
