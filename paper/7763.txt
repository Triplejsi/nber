ABSTRACT
We provide an analysis of real economic growth prospects in emerging markets after financial

liberalizations. In contrast with previous research, we identify the financial liberalization dates and
examine the influence of liberalizations while controlling for a number of other macroeconomic and

financial variables. Our work also introduces an econometric methodology that allows us to use
extensive time-series as well as cross-sectional information for our tests. We find across a number of

different specifications that financial liberalizations are associated with significant increases in real

economic growth.

1 Introduction
We present new evidence on the relation between financial market liberalizations and economic growth for a collection of emerging economies. We find that average real economic
growth increases between 1 and 2% per annum after a financial liberalization. Our results are
robust across a number of different economic specifications. This analysis, of course, reveals
no causality. However, even after we control for a comprehensive set of macroeconomic and

financial variables, our financial liberalization indicator retains significance.

There is a substantial literature that tries to explain the cross-sectional determinants of
economic growth. Barro (1991) and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) explore the ability of
a large number of macroeconomic and demographic variables to explain the cross-sectional

characteristics of economic growth rates. More recent research in the growth literature has
focused on the potential benefits of economic integration (the degree to which trade flows are

free) and general financial development. For example, Rodrik (1999) examines the relation

between openness to trade and economic growth with a standard cross-country regression

methodology. With a proxy for the general openness to trade, the evidence suggests that
the relation between economic growth and openness is statistically weak.
Following the development of endogenous growth models where financial intermediation

plays an important role, there is also an interest in determining the influence of the financial

sector on the cross-section of economic growth. King and Levine (1993) focus on several
measures of banking development, and find that banking sector development is an important
factor in explaining the cross-sectional characteristics of economic growth. Levine and Zervos

(1998) explore the degree to which both stock market and banking sector development can

explain the cross-section of economic growth rates. They find evidence in support of the
claim that equity market liquidity is correlated with rates of economic growth. Additionally,

they argue that banking and stock market development independently influence economic

growth. They also find that there is little empirical evidence to support the claim that
financial integration is positively correlated with economic growth.
Unlike previous work, we focus exclusively on the relation between real economic growth

1

and financial liberalization. Our work is partially motivated by Bekaert and Harvey (2000)
who examine the relation between financial liberalization and the dividend yield. While

the dividend yield contains information about the cost of capital, it also houses information about growth prospects. A reduction in the cost of capital and/or an improvement in
growth opportunities are the most obvious channels through which financial liberalization

can increase economic growth. Consequently, for countries that undergo financial liberal-

ization, Bekaert and Harvey also examine the relationship between economic growth and
liberalization at very short horizons and find a positive association.
Our work is also distinguished by the extensive use of time-series as well as cross-sectional

information. Indeed, the advent of financial liberalization suggests a temporal dimension to

the growth debate that is not captured by the standard cross-country estimation methodology. Typically, the growth literature focuses on either a purely cross sectional analysis or a

time-series dimension that is limited to at most three time-series observations per country.
We employ a time-series cross-sectional estimation methodology using Hansen's (1982) gen-

eralized method of moments (0MM). Our estimation strategy is considerably different from

the existing literature in that we exploit the information in overlapping time-series data.
Given the novelty of this approach, the econometric methodology is discussed extensively.

Furthermore, we conduct several Monte Carlo experiments to assess the properties of our
estimation strategy in this economic environment. Levine and Renelt (1993) discuss the cau-

tion one must exercise when interpreting cross-country regressions. They demonstrate that
the estimated coefficients are extremely sensitive to the conditioning variables employed. For

this reason, we also consider a variety of different specifications.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the variables we employ in our
empirical work. Section 3 explains the econometric methodology, and discusses the results
of a Monte Carlo analysis. Section 4 details the empirical results, and Section 5 concludes.

2 Financial Liberalization and Economic Growth
Our empirical design is to explore the relation between real per capita GDP growth over

various horizons and an indicator of official financial liberalization. The data are at the
annual frequency from 1980 through 1997. We provide the official liberalization dates in the

data appendix. These financial liberalization dates mainly represent the dates at which the
local equity market was opened up to foreign investors. A detailed analysis of these dates
and alternative sets of dates are provided in Bekaert and Harvey (2000).'
The set of variables that control for variation in economic growth rates across countries
not accounted for by equity market liberalization fall into three categories: macroeconomic
influences, banking development, and equity market development. More detailed information

on the control variables, including data sources, are contained in data appendix.
The first set of variables are linked to the condition and stability of the macroeconomy:

government consmnption divided by GDP, the size of the trade sector divided by GDP,
the annual rate of inflation, and the secondary school enrollment. Barro and Sala-i-Martin
(1995) argue that government consumption divided by GDP proxies for political corruption,
nonproductive public expenditures, or taxation. Bekaert and Harvey (1995, 1997, 2000) and
Levine and Zervos (1998) employ the size of the trade sector as imports plus exports divided
by GDP. This variable is employed as a measure of the openness of the particular economy to

trade. Barro (1997) provides evidence suggesting a negative relationship between inflation

and economic activity. Finally, Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) demonstrate the positive
relationship between education and economic growth.
Following the evidence presented in King and Levine (1993), we include a control variable

for the relationship between development in the banking sector and economic growth. In
this capacity, we employ private credit divided by gross domestic product. King and Levine

(1993) argue that this measure of banking development isolates the credit issued by private

banks, in contrast to that issued by a central bank. Furthermore, Levine and Zervos (1998)
'A chronology of important events related to financial market integration is available on the Internet in

the country risk analysis section of http://www.duke.edu/charvey.

provide evidence that the effects the banking sector and stock market development have
upon economic growth are separate, and they use this variable to capture the former.

The focus of this paper is on the relation between economic growth and equity market
liberalization. We examine three variables to proxy for the more general development of the
equity market: a measure of equity market size, the log of the number of domestic companies,

and equity market turnover as a measure of market liquidity. Both Bekaert and Harvey
(1997) and Levine and Zervos (1998) use the ratio of the equity market capitalization to gross

domestic product as a measure of the size of the local equity market. Large markets relative

to the size of the economy in which they reside potentially indicate market development.
Bekaert and Harvey (2000) employ the log of the number of companies as a measure of
market development. Atje and Jovanovic (1993) and Levine and Zervos (1998) provide
evidence for a strong relationship between economic growth and stock market liquidity, and,

therefore, we employ value traded divided by market capitalization in this capacity.

2.1 Summary statistics
Table 1 describes the sample of 30 countries that we employ in estimation, classified as
either emerging or frontier by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), for which there
are annual data extending from 1980 to 1997. Table 2 presents the summary statistics for the
macro economic variables. This includes average real per capita GDP growth rates across the

30 countries in our sample across two decades. For this variable, we provide means over the

1980's and 1990's, as well as the full sample. The average growth rates differ substantially
across time for many of the economies considered. Additionally, the rates of economic growth

vary widely across the economies included. This paper focuses on the extent to which the
time-series and cross-sectional differences can be explained by differing states of financial
liberalization of the equity market.
Figure 1 presents evidence on the rates of economic growth both before and after the offi-

cial liberalization date. Of the 21 economies that imdergo financial liberalization in sample,
17 exhibit larger average GDP growth rates after the official liberalization dates. While this

evidence implies no causality, it motivates the exploration of the relationship between eco4

nomic growth and equity market liberalization. Tables 2 and 3 present average values for the
various macroeconomic and financial, respectively, control variables across these economies.

As the average values of these control variables vary substantially in the cross-section, the

problem in examining the economic growth rates across these economies before and after
equity market liberalization is that the differences may be related to phenomena not related

to the liberalization itself, but captured by the control variables. For example, in many
countries macroeconomic reforms (including trade liberalization) happened simultaneously
or preceded financial liberalization (see Henry (2000a)). Also, as Table 3 shows, the nineties

displayed a marked increase in the size of stock markets of all countries. The number of
domestic companies and turnover also increased for most countries. - It is potentially true
that these variables are correlated with our financial liberalization indicator. Consequently,

we include in the regression specifications a set of variables, consistent with the existing
growth literature, that control for variation in economic growth rates across economies and
time potentially not accounted for by financial liberalizations.

3 Methodology
3.1 Econometrics Framework
The primary quantity of interest is the growth rate in the real per capita gross domestic
product (GDP):

=

= 1,..., N,

(1)

where Yi,t = ln( git / GDPt_J) POP is the population, and N is the number of countries
t,t

t,t—1

in our sample. Then, Yi,t--k,k represents the annual, k-year compounded growth rate of real

per capita GDP. In the growth literature, /c is often chosen to be as large as possible. Our
framework differs significantly in that we use overlapping data, facilitating the employment

of the time-dimension in addition to the cross-sectional.
Our regression specification is as follows:

= fl'Xi,t + Ei,t+kk,
5

(2)

for i =

1, . .

,N

and t =

1, . . , T.
.

Denote the independent (right-hand side) variables

employed, as discussed in Section 2, as x. While the error terms are serially correlated

= 0. The vector x

for /c > 1, E[ej,t+k,k ®

includes the country-specific logged real

per-capita GDP for 1980, which we call initial GDP hereafter. This variable is included to

capture the "conditional convergence" discussed extensively in Barro (1997). To estimate
the restricted system, consider the following stacked orthogonality conditions:
1,t+kk ® X1j
(3)
6Nt+k Ic ® XNt

With L the dimension of the 3, the system has L x N orthogonality conditions, but only L
parameters to estimate. This procedure differs from ordinary least squares, as j3 is restricted

to be identical across all countries, resulting in a system estimation that potentially corrects
for heteroskedasticity across time, heteroskedasticity across countries, and correlation among
country specific shocks (seemingly unrelated regression (SUR)).

Define Z, an N x (LN) matrix, as follows:
0

Then, one can rewrite the (LN) x 1 vector of orthogonality conditions in the following

manner:
gt+k = Z'tEt+k,

(5)

where
E1,t+k,k

(6)

To derive the GMM estimator (Hansen, 1982), it is useful to express these quantities in
matrix notation. Let
X1

= [x,j, Y = [v,t÷k,k], and e1 = [€i,t-s-k,kI.

Employing this notation, the GMM estimator satisfies

= argmin[gSgT],

(12)

where ST is the inverse of the GMM weighting matrix (see below). The First Order Condition

associated with this optimum is as follows:
(13)

Note that
7'
Hence, to set the first order condition to zero, we choose

= [(X'Z)S(z'x)]'[(x'z)S'(Z'Y)].

(14)

(15)

This is a well-known result from IV-estimators in a GMM framework. We optimally choose

the GMM weighting matrix to minimize the variance-covariance matrix of the estimated
parameter vector; ST is the estimated variance covariance matrix of (+

g4, taking all

possible autocovariances into account:

S

(16)

Using the identity matrix as the weighting matrix, first step parameter estimates are
obtained as follows:

=

{(X1'Z) (Z')]'

[(X'Z) (Z"Y)].

(17)

Then, construct the first step residuals as follows:
(18)

For the second step estimation, we use to construct the optimal weighting matrix Sf'.
In the case of overlapping data (k > 1), the residuals follow an MA(k-1) process. This
structure allows the consideration of four different specifications for the weighting matrix
that facilitate increasingly restricted variance-covariance structures across the residuals in
(2).

• Weighting Matrix I:
The most general specification facilitates temporal heteroskedasticity, cross-sectional
heteroskedasticity, and SUR effects.

=

t

+ [l
j=1

—

+ ](t=j+1 (Zt_j'Et+kjE+kZt +Zt'€t+kE÷kZt_j)).
(19)

In order to ensure that the variance-covariance matrix is positive-definite, the Newey-

West (1987) estimator is employed. K (> k) is chosen to be large enough to ensure
consistency. As the time dimension in our sample, T, is small, we do not consider this

weighting matrix specification in practice. In the interest of parsimony, we consider
three restricted variance-covariance structures.

8

• Weighting Matrix IT:
This specification facilitates cross-sectional heteroskedasticity and SUR effects, but not

temporal heteroskedasticity. Define the N x N matrix Oj as follows:

=

(20)

t=j+1

Then, the restricted variance-covariance matrix can be written as follows:

=
t

Zt'OoZt + {1 —

j1

K+ I(

(Z_'OZ + Z'OZ)).

(21)

Given the small time dimension in our sample, the small sample properties of the
estimator in this environment is questionable (see below). As a result, we restrict the

non-diagonal terms of O to be identical:
&I1j

&i

&22j
(22)

This structure greatly reduces the number of parameters in the weighting matrix struc-

ture, but retains some of the SUR flavor. When we refer to weighting matrix IT in the
estimation results section, this restricted form is employed.

• Weighting Matrix III:
This specification facilitates cross-sectional (groupwise) heteroskedasticity, but neither

temporal heteroskedasticity nor SUR effects. First, let the non-diagonal terms in O
equal zero:

5fl,j

U

o

&22j

...

0
0

(23)

•..

&NNj

where & is defined as follows:

=
t=j-4-1

9

(ej,t÷kke+kj.

(24)

Given the restricted form for I2, let 8T be determined as in (21). If GDP growth rates
across the countries in our sample are idiosyncratic, then this assumption is plausible.
Weighting Matrix IV:
The final specification facilitates neither temporal heteroskedasticity, groupwise (country-

specific) heteroskedasticity, nor SUR effects. In this case, the estimated parameters
are equivalent to those obtained from a standard pooled OLS estimation methodology,

correcting for the MA residual structure. From Q5 defined in (23),

=

trace(O5) Vj.

(25)

Then, define the restricted variance covariance matrix in the following manner:

=

+ [1 — K
+
5=1

t

t=j+1

(&Z_'Z + &_Z'Z_)).

(26)

Given the construction of the weighting matrix as in one of the preceeding specifications,
the GMM estimator is as follows:
130MM =

((X'Z)1 (Z'X)]' [(X'Z)' (Z'Y)].

(27)

The standard errors of I3CMM are determined from the variance-covariance matrix:
(28)

3.2 Monte Carlo Experiment
We explore the finite-sample properties of the GMM estimator in this economic environment. We consider three separate Monte Carlo experiments, one for each of the latter three
weighting matrix specifications, II, III and IV detailed above. We also started an experiment
using the more general SUR specification of weighting matrix II in (20) but the finite sample

properties of the estimator were quite poor.

10

3.2.1 Explanatory Variables
The first step of the Monte Carlo exercise is to generate the right hand side variables, x.
The first element of x is the logged initial real per capita GDP. We first identify the range
for this variable in the observed data, and then draw a simulated initial GDP from a uniform

distribution over this range for every country.

For the other right hand side variables, we follow a very different strategy. The macroeconomic and financial variables demonstrate significant serial and cross-correlation. We fit

a restricted VAR to the following variables: Government consumption to GDP ratio, Trade

to GDP ratio, Inflation, secondary school enrollment, Private credit to GDP ratio, market
capitalization to GDP ratio, the logged number of domestic companies, and turnover. These

are the control variables that we consider in our most general specification. As the time
dimension, T, is small in our sample, we restrict the VAR coefficients to be identical across

countries, but we allow for country specific intercepts. The restricted coefficient matrix,
reported in Appendix Table A, is estimated using pooled OLS. (We also report the standard

errors of the restricted VAR.) Given the restricted VAR coefficients, for each country we
begin the variables at their unconditional means from the observed data. We simulate 100 +
T values from the VAR for each country, and discard the initial 100 simulated observations.

Now, we have simulated observations for the right hand side variables, x, excluding the
official liberalization indicator, to which we will deal with below.

3.2.2

The Dependent Variable

The real per capita GDP growth is determined according to the model as a function of the
right hand side variables, x and the residuals, e. The null model is as follows:

= j3 Xit + Ei,t+k,k,

(29)

with no official liberalization indicator included in the right hand side variables. The vector comes from our growth model specification prior to introducing the indicator variables

presented in Table 7. As there are three separate Monte Carlo designs, that is, one for each

of the three weighting matrices under consideration,
[1

is chosen from Table 7 for each of

the three to reflect the particular weighting matrix under consideration. Given the use of
overlapping data, the residuals follow an MA(k-1) process. To mimic this environment, we
estimate a restricted MA(k-1) model for each of the residuals from the estimations performed

in Table 7, depending upon the length k. The restriction lies in the fact that we jointly
estimate the MA(k-1) process for each country, restricting the MA coefficients to be identical

across countries. This restriction is motivated in precisely the same way the VAR's are
restricted given the limited time series dimension. The restricted MA coefficients, reported
in Table A for Ac =

2,

..

, 5,

are estimated using QMLE which assumes uncorrelated errors

across countries and normal shocks in the likelihood. Then, we construct the simulated
residuals as follows:

=
6i,t+k,k

k—I

O( 8Ut+k_,),

(30)

j—o

where the Ut+k_j,j are drawn from a standard normal distribution,

is the estimated stan-

dard deviation for country i (given as the sample standard deviation of the residuals from
the regressions reported in Table 7), and the 8 are the cross-sectionally restriction MA coefficients, where 9 = 1.2 Notice that the error terms are independent of the right-hand side
control variables.

3.2.3

Official Liberalization Indicator

The construction of the liberalization indicator is very important to our Monte Carlo design.

We generate series for each country that are zeros and ones, to mimic the properties of the

observed liberalization indicator. First, we generate simulated liberalization dates drawn

from a uniform distribution over the time series dimension, i.e. from 1 to T, for each
country, so that each economy, as in our observed sample, liberalizes at some random time
in our simulated sample. Then, the liberalization indicator values for that country are fixed

at zeros prior to the simulated liberalization date and ones thereafter.
2One extension is to allow the errors to be correlated — This would better reflect the SUR estimation
structure, where as the groupwise heteroskedasticity estimation structure is related to crj.

12

The next step is to estimate the model:
Yit-f-k,k = /3x, +

i,t+k,k,

(31)

where * includes both the original control variables, jt, and the liberalization indicator.
We retain the estimated coefficient on the liberalization indicator and the corresponding
t-statistic. Under the null hypothesis of the constructed Monte Carlo model, this coefficient

should not be significantly different from zero. We perform this procedure a total of 1000

times, for each of the three weighting matrix specifications. As can be seen in Appendix
Table B, we report the summary statistics for the estimated coefficient and the t-statistic.
For weighting matrix TV, the asymptotic distribution appears to be a good approximation
to the Monte Carlo distribution for the t-statistic. For weighting matrices III and IV, there

appears to be some excess kurtosis in the t-statistic, indicating some differences from the
asymptotic distribution. For all statistics, the small sample distribution is more dispersed
than the normal distribution. We also report the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles for comparison

with the critical values we obtain in our regression specifications. For weighting matrices

III and liv, these values are substantially larger than the + 1.96 implied by the normal
critical values. This indicates that 5% statistical significance is only reached for T-statistics

larger than three (when k is larger than one). In all, the Monte Carlo analysis demonstrates
that this econometric methodology is a reasonable strategy to evaluate the effect upon GDP

growth in this economic environment, provided we account for the finite-sample nature of
the econometric environment.

4 Empirical Results
4.1 The Liberalization Effect Without Control Variables
Table 4 presents our estimates of the relation between real economic growth rates at various

horizons and an official liberalization indicator and initial real per capita GDP without any

additional control variables. Effectively, this is analogous to exploring the mean growth
rate before and after financial liberalization. Consistent with the evidence on the pre and
13

post-liberalization average growth rates presented in Section 2, these estimates demonstrate
a positive and statistically significant relation between financial liberalization and economic
growth across a variety of specifications and horizons.

In each case, the estimated coefficient is presented when the GMM weighting matrix is
constructed as in either specification II, III or IV in the previous section. Specification II is
the most general that we consider in that it allows for cross-sectional heteroskedasticity and

(restricted) SUR effects, whereas the latter two are more restricted versions. Regardless of
weighting matrix specification, the estimated coefficient is positive and significant in all cases.

The evidence implies that real GDP per capita growth rates increase following financial

liberalization by anywhere from 1.5% to as large as 2.3% per annum, on average. For
example, with a three-year horizon using weighting matrix II, the impact on real economic

growth rates is 2.0%. The evidence presented in Table 4 suggests that, on average, real
economic growth rates increase roughly 1.9% per annum following financial liberalization.

Next, we present evidence on how this relation changes when additional variables are
employed to control for various phenomena unrelated to the financial liberalization. Interestingly, the initial GDP appear to be positively related to the level of economic growth, in
contrast to the convergence theory; however, much like the purely cross-sectional growth regressions, this relationship will change dramatically as additional control variables are added,

lending credence to the concept of "conditional convergence" presented in Barro (1997).

4.2 Allowing For Control Variables
The shortcoming of exploring the changes in real economic growth rates before and after
financial liberalization is that the observed change may be related to various economic and

political phenomena unrelated to the financial liberalization. For example, periods of financial liberalization may be contemporaneous with periods of political reform or economic
3The idea is that once you control for the variables that potentially reflect the different steady states across

countries, the relationship should be negative. In this sense, the convergence across countries is conditional
on the approach of each one to differing steady states (and these additional variables potentially account for

this). See Barro (1997).

14

restructuring. When estimating the relation between growth and financial liberalization, it
is important to account for these potentially confounding effects. Consequently, we develop a

hierarchical estimation strategy that evaluates the ability of incrementally increasing control
groups to explain the cross-sectional and time-series characteristics of real economic growth.

First, we begin by estimating the relation between economic growth rates and several
macroeconomic variables that are commonly employed in the literature to explain crosssectional differences. Second, given the evidence presented in King and Levine (1993), we

then add control variables which represent banking development. Third, we add equity
market variables. These control variables encompass many of the variables deemed important

in explaining the cross-section of economic growth rates in Atje and Jovanovic (1993) and
Levine and Zervos (1998). Finally in section 4.3, we add the official liberalization indicator,

and reexamine the relation between financial liberalization and economic growth having
controlled for unrelated effects using variables employed frequently in the literature.
In accordance with our tiered strategy, the first set of regressions we consider involve the
use of three macroeconomic conditioning variables and a human capital variable: government

consumption as a share of GDP, the size of the trade sector as a share of GDP, the annual
inflation rate, and secondary school enrollment.

Table 5 presents evidence on the relation between these variables and economic growth.
As before, we present the evidence obtained using the different GMM weighting matrix spec-

ifications. While the estimated relation between these variables and real economic growth

is not entirely consistent across samples and estimation specifications, several patterns do
emerge. First, as in Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995), high levels of government consumption
are negatively (significantly) related to economic growth rates, suggesting that the instabilities or taxation associated with government consumption are obstacles to economic development. However, this relationship is statistically insignificant for weighting matrix II. Second,

the relation between the size of the trade sector and economic growth is statistically weak,
and varies across the weighting matrix specifications which is consistent the result in Rodrik

(1999) [also see Edwards (1998)]. The relation between inflation and economic growth gen-

erally is mostly statistically insignificant and switches signs. Moreover, the measured effect
15

is very small from an economic perspective. Additionally, secondary school enrollment is
generally positively and significantly related to economic growth across all weighting matrix
specifications. Finally, the relationship between initial GDP and economic growth is negative

for weighting matrices IT and III, indicating "conditional convergence" once these additional

control variables are included.
Based upon the evidence presented in King and Levine (1993), we augment the previous
set of conditioning variables by including a measure of banking sector development, the level

of private credit as a share of gross domestic product. In Table 6, we present the regressions

that include this measure. We find that the relation between the three macroeconomic
variables, secondary school enrollment and initial GDP and economic growth is generally

unaffected by the inclusion of private credit divided by GDP. The one notable change is
that inflation is now significantly predicts lower growth. Interestingly, the relation between

banking sector development and real economic growth is fairly weak. Across the GMM
weighting matrix specifications, the relationship is statistically insignificant, which is in
sharp contrast to the evidence presented by King and Levine (1993) and Levine and Zervos
(1998).

Levine and Zervos (1998) explore the degree to which banking and stock market development explain the cross-sectional characteristics of economic growth. They find that
two measures of stock market liquidity are positively related to economic growth, and that
stock market and banking development have separate effects upon growth. We employ eq-

uity market turnover as our development indicator. Additionally, they find a positive, but

statistically weak, relationship between stock market size and GDP growth. We employ
the number of domestic companies and the equity market capitalization divided by GDP as
measures of stock market size. These variables can also proxy for market development.

In Table 7, we present the estimated regression coefficients when we add these three
measures of equity market development to the control variables presented above, including

the measure of banking development. The estimated relation between the macro economic
variables and economic growth is qualitatively and quantitatively affected by the inclusion

of. the three equity market variables. The government/GDP and trade/GDP variables have
16

now generally a larger sign, and are economically and statistically significant. The infation

effect has lost robustness across specifications. The enrollment variables is still important,
but its effect is weaker both in an economic and statistical sense. The relation between initial

GDP and economic growth is now negative and significant across almost all specifications.
Additionally, the measure of banking development is now positively and significantly related

to growth at longer horizons, which is consistent with the evidence presented in King and
Levine (1993) and Levine and Zervos (1998). The coefficient on equity market size is generally

negative and significant. Additionally, the relation between the logged number of companies

and the rate of economic growth is positive and significant. In accordance with the evidence

presented in Levine and Zervos (1998), the relationship between turnover and economic
growth is positive and significant in nearly all cases.

4.3 The Liberalization Effect with Control Variables
Having potentially controlled for unrelated phenomena by using the macroeconomic, banking

sector, and equity market variables employed in the existing growth literature, we return to
the relationship between economic growth and financial liberalization, where again the latter

is measured using the official liberalization indicator. Table 8 presents the regressions with

the financial liberalization indicator and all the control variables. The results in Table 8
show that the estimated relation between the control variables and economic growth are
generally unaffected by the inclusion of the liberallzation indicator. As before, the relation
between economic growth and banking sector development is positive and significant only

at longer horizons. The enrollment variable now proves fragile. However, it is striking
that across all weighting matrix specifications, financial liberalization is associated with a
higher level of real economic growth. The evidence implies that real GDP per capita growth

rates increase following financial liberalization by anywhere from 0.7% to as large as 1.4%

per annum. Despite the large Monte Carlo critical values presented in Appendix Table B,

these estimates retain statistical significance at the 95% confidence level in many of the
specifications considered.

Overall, the evidence presented in Table 8 suggests that on average real economic growth
17

rates increase roughly 1.1% per annum following financial liberalization. This finding is con-

sistent with that presented in Table 4, when no control variables are employed, suggesting
the relation between financial liberalization and economic growth is robust across weighting matrix specifications and conditioning variables. Levine and Renelt (1994) demonstrate

that the estimated coefficients in cross-country regressions require extreme caution in interpretation, as they are sensitive to the set of control variables employed. Consequently,
the evidence presented in Table 8 strengthens the argument that financial liberalization explains an important part of the cross-sectional and time-series characteristics of real economic
growth.

4.4 Regional Integration
We consider an alternative specification that allows for regional differences in the measured
effect of financial liberalization on economic growth. In particular, the high level of economic

growth observed in Latin American countries after the debt crisis may significantly affecting

the relationship between liberalization and growth discussed above. Although this higher

growth after the "lost decade" may be due in part to financial liberalization, this is open

to debate. Therefore, we explore whether Latin American countries drive our results by
estimating the following regional regression equation:
Y1t+k,k = ,3'x + 81(lib indicator1 Latin) + 52(lib indicator1 . (1-Latin1)) + 61t+kk,

(32)

where Latin1 takes the value of 1 if country i is a Latin American country, and 0 otherwise.
This specification allow the relationship between financial liberalization and economic growth

to differ across Latin American and non-Latin American countries.
Given the evidence presented in Table 9 for these estimated regressions, the regional effect

is negligible. If anything, the growth affect appears considerably weaker in Latin American

countries relative to other countries. This suggests that the observed liberalization effect
discussed above (and presented in Table 8) is not being driven by regional economic success

in Latin America during our sample period.

5 Conclusions
The goal of the paper is to explore the relation between financial liberalization and real
economic growth. While considerable effort in the past has been expended on the economic

and financial fundamentals that explain the cross-section of economic growth, we focus on
financial liberalizations. We emphasize the time-series èomponent of growth in addition to
the cross-sectional relation. Our results suggest that financial market liberalizations are as-

sociated with higher real growth, in the range of one percent per annum. The impact of
financial market liberalizations is robust to the inclusion of the usual set of control variables representing the macroeconomic environment, banking development and stock market
development.

Although this empirical result is intriguing, it warrants further analysis. First, we have
focused only ow emerging financial markets. In the standard cross-sectional growth literature, larger cross-sections are used including developed countries. Second, dating financial

liberalization is problematic (see Bekaert, Harvey, and Lumsdaine (1999)), and we should
consider further robustness checks on the financial liberalization dates we consider.4 Finally,
the results remain inherently empirical. How do financial liberalizations result in higher eco-

nomic growth? Bekaert and Harvey (2000) and Henry (2000a and 200Gb) provide evidence

that the cost of capital may have decreased and investment increased after capital market
liberalization. Table 8 reveals that the turnover coefficient decreases when the liberalization

indicator is introduced, suggesting perhaps a liquidity/efficiency mechanism for enhanced
growth. We plan to carefully examine all of these research questions in future work.

4We performed one robustness check reestimating the model without control variables using the 16 coun-

tries that Bekaert and Harvey (2000) show have breaks in their net capital flows. The results using this
alternative indicator or liberalization are broadly consistent with what we have reported.

6 Data Appendix
In the system estimation described in econometric methodology section, all data are employed at the annual frequency.

GDP growth. Growth of real per capita gross domestic product. Available for all
countries from 1980 through 1997 from the World Bank Development Indicators CD-ROM.

Trade. 'hade is the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a
share of gross domestic product. Available for all countries from 1980 through 1997 from
the World Bank Development Indicators CD-ROM.

Government Consumption. Government Consumption divided by gross domestic
product. General government consumption includes all current expenditures for purchases
of goods and services by all levels of government, excluding most government enterprises. It
also includes capital expenditure on national defense and security. Available for all countries
from 1980 through 1997 from the World Bank Development Indicators CD-ROM.
Inflation. Inflation as measured by the annual growth rate of the gross domestic product
implicit deflator. Available for all countries from 1980 through 1997 from the World Bank
Development Indicators CD-ROM.

Secondary School Enrollment. Secondary School Enrollment Ratio is the ratio of
total enrollment, regardless of age, to the population of the age group that officially corresponds to the level of education shown. Available for all countries from 1980 through 1997
from.the World Bank Development Indicators CD-ROM.

Private Credit. Private credit divided by gross domestic product. Credit to private
sector refers to financial resources provided to the private sector, such as through loans,
purchases of non-equity securities, and trade credits and other accounts receivable that
establish a claim for repayment. Available for all countries from 1980 through 1997 from the
World Bank Development Indicators CD-ROM.

Market Capitalization. Equity market capitalization divided by gross domestic product. Equity market capitalization is from the International Finance Corporation's Emerging
Stock Markets Factbook. The gross domestic product data are from the World Bank Development Indicators CD-ROM. Data are available from 1980 through 1997.
Number of Companies. The log of the number of domestic companies covered taken

data are available from 1980 through 1997.
Thrnover. The ratio of equity market value traded to the market capitalization. Both
are available from the International Finance Corporation's Emerging Stock Markets Factbook. The data are available from 1980 through 1997.

Official Liberalization Indicator. The variable takes a value of one when the equity
market is liberalized, and zero otherwise. Liberalization dates are based upon the chronology
presented in Bekaert and Harvey (2000) for the markets covered by the International Finance
Corporation's Global Indices. These dates are as follows:
