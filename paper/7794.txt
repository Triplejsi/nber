Background

Unions have well‚Äìdocumented effects on their members and on the firms that employ
these workers. (See Freeman and Medoff (1984) for one review). One question that has
received less attention is the extent to which unions have effects on non-union workers and
firms which do not employ union workers. A limited and narrowly‚Äìfocused literature in
labor economics on ‚Äúunion threat effects‚Äù (effects of unionization on the wages of the non‚Äì
unionized), for example, has been rather inconclusive. (See Freeman and Medoff (1981),
Neumark and Wachter (1995), DiNardo, Hallock and Pischke (1997) and Leicht (1989) for
example). Moreover, there appears to be little consensus on whether the combination of
direct effects (the effect of unionization on the unionized) and indirect effects (the effect
on the nonunionized) is even positive. (See Bound and Johnson (1995) for a clear recent
statement of the view).
A primary weakness of the most recent empirical literature, however, is that the magnitude and type of variation in unionization in the recent past is arguably insufficient (even
if appropriately exogenous) to estimate ‚Äúindirect‚Äù effects. For example, the most striking
aspect of recent research using information from union certifications over the last twenty
years is the small level of this type of activity. (Bronars and Deere 1993, DiNardo et al.
1997).
Our study begins with the premise that the extent of union effects is potentially easier
to detect when changes in unionization are large and important. Toward that end we focus
on the period between the two world wars, an important time for the U.S. labor movement.
After witnessing a prodigious and rapid increase in membership at the end of the nineteenth
century, American unionism experienced a decline of almost equal magnitude in the period
leading up to the first World War. Indeed the ferocity of business and government hostility
to the attempt to organize American workers left little doubt about the importance of the
struggle. As we will argue below, this period and the period leading up to World War II
2

provide a unique time to investigate the impact of strikes on firms.
We focus on the economic consequences of strikes during the interwar period as reflected
in the behavior of the stock market. Our point of departure is that the strikes we identify
during this period (especially as compared to the present) were primarily an attempt
by workers to change the ‚Äúterms of trade‚Äù between workers and their employers. We
then evaluate, using standard event‚Äìstudy methods, the effect of various important strike
characteristics on broad industry‚Äìlevel measures of equity prices. While several studies (e.g.
Becker and Olson (1986) Neumann (1990) Kramer and Vasconcellos (1996) and Persons
(1995)) have investigated the link between strikes and stock prices, these studies focus on
a much more recent period where data are publicly available, and the importance of the
strikes for the structure of industrial relations is arguably much smaller than in the time
period we consider.
Given our focus on strikes, our paper is directly related to two literatures. In one,
(see Neumann and Reder (1984)) the effect of strikes on industry wide output is measured
using industry-wide measures such as inventories, shipments, etc. In another, the lost
value associated with strikes is measured using data on market valuation (see Ruback and
Zimmerman (1984) for example). This literature is closely related to the ‚Äúevent study‚Äù
literature in finance and has focused exclusively on using stock market returns from individual firms. At its most basic level, our approach is a ‚Äúcombination‚Äù of both approaches.
Like the firm level studies, we use information from the capital markets; unlike that literature, and in common with the literature on the ‚Äúindustry-wide‚Äù effect of strikes, we focus
on broadly defined industrial aggregates.
Our paper then is essentially an examination of the impact of strikes on industry stock
prices at a time when unions were rapidly evolving. The outline of the paper is as follows.
In Section 2, we develop a simple analytical framework for examining the relationship
between strikes and stock prices. Section 3 briefly describes the historical context and in
Section 4 we describe our data. Section 5 is a brief description of the well‚Äìknown event
3

study method. Section 6 describes our empirical results, and Section 7 compares our
findings with those from studies using more recent data. Section 8 concludes.

Analytical Framework

At first glance, it might be surprising to find any effect of strike activity on industry wide
measures of output. The first puzzle involves why strikes should have any effect on the
returns of individual firms. In the context of an infinitely lived firm, and when strikes have
no effect on the terms of trade, the change in the value of discounted earnings streams would
be quite small. Given the considerable evidence that the measured change in market values
of firms resulting from strikes is not negligible (e.g. Becker and Olson (1986), Neumann
(1990), and Ruback and Zimmerman (1984)) we follow the earlier literature and presume
that it is meaningful to investigate the presence of such an effect.
Once we depart from the single firm and consider the entire industry, it is necessary for
us to consider the effect of union bargains on non‚Äìunionized firms or those not immediately
party to the contract negotiations.1 One‚Äôs a priori view of the sign/magnitude of these
indirect effects depends on the mechanism by which unions (in this historical context) raise
wages.
The simplest way to proceed is to adopt the view that unions act as a cartelling mechanism. In an otherwise perfectly competitive industry, the effect of unionization could be
quite dramatic. Indeed, in this view unionism is best characterized as a potentially fatal
infection as in Kremer (1999).2 The firm, uniquely targeted to pay above market wages
is replaced by other non-unionized firms. The evidence for this view is minimal. While
unions negatively impact market valuations of a firm, prima facie, the fact that unionized
and non‚Äìunionized firms coexist, suggests that it is not always the case that all the assets
1

See Lazear (1983) for some of the subtleties involved.
It should be noted however, that in Kremer‚Äôs (1999) more nuanced and articulated framework, firm
death is only one of several possible outcomes.

of the firm are reassigned to other (more productive and profitable) non-union firms even
in the very long run. Under this view, it is far from clear that the effect of a strike should
have significant effects on broad industry wide aggregates. If other non-unionized firms fill
in the breach, the impact of the strike will still be rather small.
Efficient contract or ‚ÄúNash bargaining‚Äù models provide yet another basis for expectations regarding the effect of strikes on the firm (Brown and Ashenfelter 1986, MaCurdy
and Pencavel 1986). In these models, firms have economic profits which the union seeks to
extract.
If one views a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù strike as a one time ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù change in the share of the
surplus going to workers, the effect of the strike on the value of the firm will be proportional
to the change in profits going to the firm. The effect on industrial activity at large will
be small to the extent that the strike‚Äôs effects are limited exclusively to the struck firm
and/or the firm‚Äôs share of output is small.
To prepare the way for our empirical analysis, consider the extreme case of when wage
bargains reached by unions accrue to all workers in an industry.3 Again for simplicity, we
assume a constant real rate of interest r. Before the strike, the industry faces a probability
œÄ of a one‚Äìtime permanent change in the value of firm due to the fact that the union calls
a strike and wins.4 If we denote earnings in a given time period by D, and the percentage
change in the share going to the firm by ‚àíŒ¥ the value of the firm prior to the strike decision
is:

E[V0 ] = œÄ

If the union strikes and wins, the value of the firm is merely:
3

The presentation could be made more realistic by considering a finite time horizon or the possibility
of future union wins or losses, but this would merely complicate the expressions without adding additional
insight.

1 - œÄ, then, is the probability that the union doesn‚Äôt call a strike or calls one and loses.

Vunion strike and win =

The percentage change in the value of the firm (or log difference) when the union wins
is then given by:

Percent change in the value of the firm =
1 ‚àí Œ¥œÄ
)
log(E[V0 ]) ‚àí log(Vunion strikes and wins ) = log(
1‚àíŒ¥
‚âà (1 ‚àí œÄ)Œ¥

(3)

(4)

This expression has a simple interpretation. The percentage change in the value of the
firm when the union strikes and wins an important fight is equal to the product of the
probability that the union loses or does not strike at all (1 - œÄ) and the fraction of earnings
that flow away from shareholders towards workers (Œ¥). If firms completely anticipate a
union strike and victory (œÄ = 1) and this information were already incorporated into the
value of the firm, a strike would have no effect on excess returns.
The analysis is completely symmetrical for the case where the union does not strike
or strikes and loses. In this case, the magnitude of the measured effect of union losses on
stock prices will be largest when the probability firms attach to a union loss are small. The
measured effect of a union loss on stock returns will be small whenever a union defeat is
likely.
The interpretations are summarized in the table below. We interpret changes in excess
returns at the industry level as evidence that unions have industry‚Äìwide effects. If union
threat effects are unimportant, or unions only affect the ‚Äústruck‚Äù employer, we expect
changes in industry excess returns to be zero. On the other hand, if union threat effects are
important, we expect non‚Äìzero changes in excess returns. Furthermore, if the probability

6

of a union victory is small, we expect negative changes in excess returns when the union
wins, and much smaller positive values for union defeats.

Historical Context

As mentioned in the introduction, the interwar period is particularly interesting / unique
for our analysis. The role of the state during most of the sample period was either absent
or hostile to unionism. Moreover, it is clear that most participants firmly believed that
the outcome of the battle between capital and labor was of great significance and the immediate stakes were enormous. For example, at the beginning of our sample period the
Industrial Workers of the World began as ‚Äúthe last important national organization to challenge the philosophy of business unionism . . . [ but by the end of World War I had become]
a tiny organization whose status as a labor union was questionable.‚Äù(Rees 1977) Moreover,
it is quite clear (particularly before 1934) that ‚Äúunions existed in a predominately non‚Äì
institutionalized setting. Union recognition, collective bargaining and labor‚Äìmanagement
contractual agreements were not yet legal, and in fact much of the conflict between labor
and capital was over the right to organize.‚Äù(Rubin 1986) At the same time, the government‚Äôs attempts to avert strikes that might damage wartime production and other concerns
led to the passage of the Clayton Act. The Clayton Act abolished the legal framework
which had most limited union organizing ‚Äì the principle that unions violated the Sherman

7

Anti‚Äìtrust Act by acting as a ‚Äúrestraint on trade.‚Äù5 As a consequence, the interwar period
was arguably the crucible that set the terms of trade under which unions would be tolerated by business and the government after World War II and serves as an ideal context to
study the impact of strikes on stock prices.
In addition, unlike the period after World War II, the role of the state in providing
income support (sometimes viewed as an ‚Äúalternative‚Äù to unionism) was rather small.
Moreover, the institutional features that were to mark postwar industrial relations were
forged in part during this critical period. ‚ÄúPattern bargaining‚Äù and the creation of industrial relations schools were formed in light of the perception of the ‚Äúrelative permanence‚Äù of
collective bargaining. By way of contrast, during the interwar period the view of collective
bargaining as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù was not widespread. This belief was reflected in
the nature of the strikes which generally occurred over debates on fundamental aspects of
workplace relations.

Data

The two main data sources for this paper are the information on the specific strikes and
industry financial data. The first set of data come from a history of significant strikes from
the relevant time period (Filippelli 1990). The stock price data are from a Yale University
report (Cowles and Associates 1938). In each case, we had to go through the sources
by hand (or use scanning technology along with Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
software to collect the data).
We investigated a broad set of possibilities for collecting data on strikes from this
particularly important period in labor history including, for example, Peterson (1938).
However, only one that we were able to locate offered us the exact relevant dates associated
5

In practice, of course, the Clayton Act was not a panacea for American trade unionism. Indeed, in
the first twenty four years after its passage more cases of antitrust violations were brought against labor
than in the twenty four preceding years. See (Fisher 1940).

8

with the strike which are crucial to the event study method we employ and describe below.
This book, Labor Conflict in the United States: An Encyclopedia, gives detailed accounts of
various important strikes during our time period written by a host of authors and compiled
by Filippelli (1990). Obviously, we only focus attention on a certain select set of strikes.
Filippelli (1990) examines 254 total strikes over a very long time period. Over the time
period we consider, in part due to limitations of our financial market data, we examine 36
strikes. In describing the strikes selected in Filippelli‚Äôs (1990) book, he states that ‚Äú. . . it
is hoped that all of the conflicts that labor historians have agreed are pivotal in American
history are included. These are the strikes that appear in all standard labor histories.‚Äù
(page xii.)
Importantly, this same source also provides us with a wealth of other valuable information about the strike that allows us to create another set of variables including the duration
of the strike, the industry involved in the strike, whether the union was recognized by the
struck firm as a result of the strike, whether the union was new or established6 , the number
of strikers involved, whether there was violence during the strike, whether wages were increased, decreased or stayed the same after the strike, and who was the eventual ‚Äúwinner‚Äù
of the strike (union or management).
Simple statistics for each of the strikes are contained in Table 1. Obviously some of the
data in this table is based on purely ‚Äúobjective‚Äù criteria, such as the number of strikers,
or the date of the start of the strike and is therefore easily culled from the narratives of
the strikes. Other data, such as whether the union or firm ‚Äúwon‚Äù are more subjective. We
discuss these subjective measures below.
The first strike in our sample started in January of 1925 and the last one started in
6

We define an ‚Äúestablished‚Äù or ‚Äúold‚Äù union by first identifying the name of the union from accounts in
Filippelli (1990) and a variety of other sources (Gifford 1999, Reynolds and Killingsworth 1944, Fink 1977)
to identify the date the union was established: Unions older than three years were defined as established.
Our results are robust to different definitions of ‚Äúestablished‚Äù.

May of 1937 7 . The strikes occurred in 17 different industries. The average strike duration
was 5.5 months. Violence was mentioned in the narratives in just over half of the strikes.
Wages decreased in only a handful of cases, stayed the same in about half, and increased in
just over a third of strikes. Following Card and Olson (1995), we also attempted to identify
the ‚Äúwinner‚Äù of the strike.8 To situate our sample in the broader sample of all strikes that
occurred during this period, we present some information from Griffin (1939) who includes
a much larger set of strikes in his analysis of strikes from 1880-1937. Figure 1 (which was
generated using data from the Griffin study) reveals that for the period 1925-1937 (the
period we analyze), that the median annual percentage was 35 percent for ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù (from
the perspective of the unions), 33.4 percent for ‚Äúfailed‚Äù, and 30.7 percent for compromise.
Given the consistency with our estimates, we conclude that our sample of strikes, apart
from their greater ‚Äúimportance‚Äù, are not radically different from the broader sample of
strikes.
Our stock price data come from Cowles (1938) Common-Stock Indexes: 1871-1937.
This book contains several series for common stocks by industry by month over a relatively
long time period. One distinguishing characteristic of the book is that its description of
the data and industries are the product of a tremendous amount of effort and meticulous
attention to detail. The indexes covered include: dividend payments, price‚Äìearnings ratios, earnings, stock prices, and stock prices including cash dividends. For each industry,
we scanned in the stock prices including cash dividends for each month from 1916-1937
(although we only use the data from 1925 - 1937 here). Since there is no information
for a four month period during World War I, this leaves us with 380 months of data for
7

There are later strikes contained in the Filippelli (1990) volume but our stock price data (described
below) end at the end of 1937.
8
We identified the union to be the winner in 53 percent of the strikes. Obviously it is not always easy
to identify the ‚Äúwinner‚Äù of a strike. We determined the winner based our subjective evaluation of the
Filippelli narratives. In ten percent of the cases, see Table 1, the winner of the strike is not clear. Our
results are insensitive to our treatment of the ambiguous cases. Below, we further investigate the strikes
which led to union recognition, often one of the key goals of the strikers.

each industry. Since we collected information on 69 industries this gives us 36,220 industry/months of data.9 It is also worth noting that we do not have complete information
on security prices for all industries for the entire time period. One example is absence of
stock prices for automobiles and trucks, which as of the late 19th century, had not yet
been invented. Figure 2 displays the average stock price over time using these data. The
dramatic increase up to the great crash of 1929 is clear from the figure, as is the subsequent
increase.

The Event Study Method

A goal of our work is to assess the impact of strikes on industry stock prices during the
interwar period. The most straightforward method would be as follows: merely examine
industry stock returns before and after the strike and then attribute the entire stock price
change to the effects of the strike. This is only appropriate however, if general economy
wide conditions are unchanging during the strike period. If not, then we need to generate
an assessment of the movement of stock prices that would have occurred in the absence of
the strike.
The event study method has been widely used in industrial relations research, including
for example, Becker and Olson (1986), and Abowd, Milkovich and Hannon (1990). The
technical aspects of the method we employ are carefully described in Brown and Warner
(1985), Campbell, Lo and MacKinlay (1997), Fama, Fisher, Jensen and Roll (1969), and
MacKinlay (1997). We will therefore describe the basic ideas only briefly. We begin by
concentrating on the effect of a strike around the start of the strike.
Cumulative average excess returns are calculated using the very simple model outlined
below. Let t index time in trading months, let s indicate the ‚Äúevent month‚Äù (the month

well. We hand-checked each observation and found that only about 4 percent were in error.

of the start of the strike), and let i indicate industries. First the industry monthly stock
return, Rit , is regressed on Rmt , the average market return for month t, which we also
collected from the Cowles (1938) data. This regression,

Rit = Œ±i + Œ≤i Rmt + Œ∑it ,

(5)

is estimated for a period10 from month s ‚àí 24 to month s ‚àí 12. We estimate this regression
for a period preceding the strike so as to avoid potential contamination of our counterfactual
by expectations of a strike. This allows us to assess the behavior of the industry prices
relative to the market in the absence of the strike. The next step is to compute abnormal
returns (or excess returns) for each month around the event date in the following way:

ERit = Rit ‚àí (Œ±ÃÇi + Œ≤ÃÇi Rmt ),

(6)

where Œ±ÃÇi and Œ≤ÃÇi are the estimated regression coefficients from equation (5). ERit is then
the excess return for each industry i for each month t. It is the difference between the
actual return Rit and the predicted return (Œ±ÃÇi + Œ≤ÃÇi Rmt ) based on the estimated parameters
from equation (5). In the absence of strikes ERit should clearly equal zero on average.
The excess returns calculated for each month around the start of a strike are used
to calculate the average excess returns for each strike. These are easily computed by
averaging the monthly excess returns for each strike. We also compute the ‚Äúcumulative‚Äù
excess returns, which are computed by adding monthly excess returns for various intervals
(called event ‚Äúwindows‚Äù) around the date of the strike. Cumulative average excess returns
are, therefore, clearly just the average of these cumulative excess returns across all strikes.
The tests for statistical significance and the precise statistic used are discussed in Campbell et al. (1997). These tests proceed by observing that average excess returns and cumulative average excess returns, in the absence of ‚Äúnews‚Äù which permanently alters the value
10

We tried other prediction periods with no meaningful effect on the results.

12

of the firm, should be zero. The extent that these returns are different from zero is evidence
that supports the hypothesis that the events we have identified provided important news.
Another issue is the definition and timing of the event. In the typical event study,
where excess returns over a period of a few days are being evaluated, defining the timing
of the event is critically important and often very difficult. Researchers must be able to
carefully identify when participants in capital markets first became aware of news. We
are not as concerned with this issue, since our periods are measured in months. Other
implications of the timing are discussed below.

Empirical Results

In many traditional financial event studies, it is transparent how one dates an ‚Äúevent‚Äù; while
clear in most cases, it is not quite so clear in our example. In principle, the appropriate date
is the date at which most of the ‚Äúinformation‚Äù in the strike is incorporated. If the financial
markets are forward‚Äìlooking, and most of the information is revealed at the beginning of
the strike then the date of the strike announcement is most relevant. Table 2 presents our
estimates of cumulative average excess industry stock returns for various windows relative
to the strike announcement date.
Each column of the table reports results based on a different event window: month 0
(this is simply the excess return during the strike start month averaged over all strikes),
month 0 to month + 1 (this is the sum of the excess returns over the two month period
from the month of the strike announcement to the month after the announcement averaged
over all strikes), month -1 to month 0, month -1 to month + 1, month -2 to month +2,
and month -3 to month +3. In principle, results from all windows should be roughly
the same. If the frequency of our stock price information were daily, we could date strike
announcements perfectly, and if ‚Äúnews‚Äù is transmitted and markets react quickly, we would
expect that the shortest window to be the most appropriate window. However, given the
13

frequency of the stock data and our a priori expectations on the speed of transmission of
economic news from strikes during the interwar period, our preferred results are those that
use the windows from t = ‚àí1 to 1 month. For completeness, we also report results for
other wider windows.
The first row of the table summarizes the information for all strikes. The second pair
of rows in the table compares union wins to union losses. Subsequent sets of rows report
results contrasting ‚Äúviolent‚Äù strikes, whether wages went up, down, or remained the same,
many (more than the median of 3700) strikers or few strikers, short (less than the median
of 2 months) strikes to longer strikes, whether or the strike resulted in recognition of the
union by the firm, whether the strike was industry wide, and whether the strike was by an
established union (defined above).
The evidence from the table is generally consistent with the view that the financial markets viewed these strikes as important. In general, the results are economically significant
and statistically different from zero at conventional levels of significance. For example, the
point estimates in the row labeled ‚Äúunion win‚Äù indicate losses to the firm of about 7 percent for our preferred specification (month -1 to month +1) and are statistically different
from zero. In contrast, union losses led to generally quite small stock price changes (-0.1
percent) and not distinguishable from zero at conventional levels of significance.
More striking perhaps, is that when wages fell in response to the strike, the estimated
positive impact on the value of the industry was roughly 9 percent using our preferred
window width, and statistically different from zero. In contrast, when wages remained the
same or increased (a tiny fraction of our total observations) our point estimates indicate
that the value of the industry fell between 3 and 5 percent, although our estimates for the
cases of ‚Äúwages up‚Äù are imprecise.
It is also interesting to note that strikes leading to the recognition of the union by the
firm appeared to have had a much larger negative share price reaction than strikes which
did not lead to the recognition of a union. (Compare for example, -0.065 to -0.016, in
14

the month -1 to month +1 window in Table 2). Also, as expected, strikes that involved
an entire industry had a much larger negative effect (albeit imprecise) on industry stock
prices than strikes involving a single firm (or a small number of firms).
Strikes that involved new versus established unions are the subject of the last two rows
of Table 2. It appears that, on average, strikes by established unions lead to larger negative
industry share price reactions. Although these estimates are not precise they are consistent
with the view that more established unions have more power against management than
new unions.
Another interesting pattern in our results is that ‚Äúbad news‚Äù (from the firms‚Äô perspective) led to revisions much larger in magnitude than ‚Äúgood news.‚Äù In terms of the simple
model we sketched in the Section 2, this is consistent with a low value for œÄ, the probability
that the workers strike and win. Long strikes led to estimated losses of about 4 percent,
whereas short strikes led to very small losses (roughly 1 percent).
The only apparently anomalous results are those for the number of strikers: our point
estimates for the effect on stock prices are larger in magnitude for small strikes (-5.6
percent) than for large strikes (-0.8 percent.) This is less anomalous than meets the eye,
however, and is explicable by our mechanism for choosing strikes. If size is only one
aspect of ‚Äúimportance,‚Äù then strikes with fewer strikers that made it to the list had to be
more important in other dimensions. The results for other window widths are generally
insignificantly different from the results for our preferred window widths, and are generally
less precise.
Table 3 repeats the analysis, except windows are calculated around the end of the strike.
In general, the results are uniformly less precise11 and in generally insignificantly different
from zero at conventional levels of significance. This is consistent with the view that most
of the ‚Äúnews‚Äù in strikes occurs at the beginning of the strike, and with other research. The
11
One possible reason for this is that the end of the strike may be difficult identify correctly, especially
in those case where the management is defined as the winner.

15

principal exception is the subsample for which wages fell in response to the strike. In this
case, our point estimates of the increase in the value of the firm are on the order of 13
percent.
In Table 4, we combine both windows ‚Äì around the start of the strike and around the
end of the strike. This is appropriate if both the strike announcement and its conclusion
contain significant economic news. Perhaps surprisingly, our estimates become somewhat
more precise and the magnitude of the effects become much larger. For our preferred
window widths, union wins lead to roughly a 3 percent decrease in the value of the firm.
For wage changes, our point estimates are quite (almost implausibly) large. Strikes that
resulted in lower wages lead to increases of 22 percent in the value of the firm, and strikes
with no wage increases led to losses on the order of 7 percent. Likewise, short strikes lead
to an increase of roughly 7 percent and our longer strikes led to losses of about 8 percent.
In addition, with our preferred window width (month -1 to month +1) recognition strikes
appear to have led to losses on the order of 10 percent (non‚Äìrecognition strikes led to small
gains), industry wide strikes resulted in losses on the order of 18 percent and strikes by
established unions had much larger negative share price reactions than strikes involving
new unions.

Comparison With Other Work

We focus on the relationship between strikes and industry stock prices during the period
between the world wars ‚Äì specifically because this was a time that labor historians and
informed observers agree is quite important. Nevertheless, it is interesting to compare
our results to those of a host of studies using data from a much more recent time period.
Several are noteworthy. For example, in a comprehensive study of the impact of strikes

16

on individual firm stock prices from 1962-198212 , Becker and Olson (1986) find that the
average large strike represented a 4.1 percent decline in stock prices. Persons (1995) finds
that the share price reaction to struck automobile producers and steel suppliers was around
1.6 percent on the days around the strike. Neumann (1990) finds a share price reaction of
about 0.5 percent on the day of an announced strike for a sample of firms struck in the late
1960s and mid 1970s.13 Nelson, Amoako-Adu and Smith (1994) study 124 Canadian strikes
between January 1983 and July 1989 and find a loss in stock price of about 1 percent for
the 5 day window around the strike.14
Although each of these studies uses a different time period, sample of strikes and event
window, they all suggest a negative share price reaction of between 1 and 4 percent around
the start of the strike. As we discuss above, our baseline reaction to stock prices (in row
1 of Table 2) is a loss of 3 percent of stock price for the three-month event-window (our
preferred specification). Despite this similarity, we should again point out some important
differences between our study and the aforementioned studies.
First, our study concentrates on monthly returns; the others concentrate on daily returns. We argue that the decision to study monthly returns is more reasonable for our
time period. This assumption would most obviously be problematic for more recent time
periods; no doubt, markets react more quickly today than in the past.15 Second, our focus
is on industries and previous research has focused on share price reactions in individual
firms. Finally, we use data from a period where labor historians believe strikes were ‚Äúpivotal in American History.‚Äù In any event, our results suggest a relatively large share price
12

The Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) at the University of Chicago only published daily
stock prices after 1962. All of the previous studies concentrated after this date.
13
Neumann (1990) goes on to discuss that the stock market seems to predict the occurrence of strikes
quite well during this period.
14
Also see Kramer and Vasconcellos (1996), Davidson, Worrell and Garrison (1988), and Ruback and
Zimmerman (1984) for related studies.
15
Farber and Hallock (2000) discuss the changing stock price reaction to job loss announcements over
time using data from 1970-97 and briefly discuss whether changes in technology have somehow made news
less timely and therefore less ‚Äúnewsworthy.‚Äù They find very little support for this hypothesis.

17

reaction to strikes for entire industries and these effects are larger than those found in the
aforementioned studies excepting Becker and Olson (1986) although, like the others, their
focus was on the reactions of individual firms.
Given our concentration on industry returns, the magnitude of our estimates might be
surprising, since we expect industry wide reactions to strikes to be smaller than the effect
on specific firms (as business moves from struck to unstruck firms, for example). Moreover,
our evidence is roughly consistent with Kramer and Vasconcellos (1996) who find effects
on unstruck firms that are statistically indistinguishable from those on struck firms from
1982-1990. On the other hand, given our focus on the seminal industrial relations strikes of
the inter-war period, our results are consistent with historians and others who have singled
out this period as one of unusual importance in the development of postwar industrial
relations.

Concluding Comments

The primary motivation of this work is to investigate the effect of strikes on industry
stock prices at a time when unions were rapidly evolving. In contrast to recent work on
the subject which has utilized data from the recent past, we look to a period of time
where changes in the level of unionization were more important: it is easier to measure the
effect of ‚Äúlarge changes‚Äù than it is to detect small changes in the current era of declining
unionization.
The time between the world wars (1925 - 1937) was particularly important in the history
of unionization. Unlike many of the strikes of the current period, during this period of time
many were an attempt by workers to change the ‚Äúterms of trade‚Äù between workers and
employers.
Our empirical approach melds two previous literatures: in one, the effects of strikes
on industry wide measures of output, such as inventories, are studied, in the second, a
18

standard ‚Äúevent study‚Äù approach is used to examine the relationship between strikes and
individual firm stock valuations. In addition to developing a data set with a unusually rich
set of characteristics for each of the strikes for the time period 1925-1937 and combining
this information with stock return data, we use a very parsimonious model that helps
provide (one) consistent interpretation of our results.
On a descriptive level, we find that strikes have large negative effects on industry stock
valuation. In addition, longer strikes, violent strikes, strikes where the union wins, strikes
that led to union recognition, industry wide strikes, and strikes that lead to wage increases
affect industry stock prices more negatively than strikes with other characteristics. We
also examine industry stock price movements around the start and the end of the strike.
It seems that ‚Äúnews‚Äù about the strike seems to be revealed early - that is, there are much
larger industry stock price reactions around the start of strikes than at the end.
In the context of our simple model, effects of successful strikes are quite important.
The generally asymetric response of stock prices to wins and losses is consistent with the
view that firms generally expected unions to lose. Despite this, the size of the effects when
the union wins are consistent with the view that the effects of strikes were not limited to
the single firm being struck, but felt industry wide by investors. Our analysis suggests
that financial markets viewed union victories in the inter-war period as very important
determinants of the share of firm profits going to stockholders.
