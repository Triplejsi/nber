1. Introduction
During the 1980s, many developing countries abandoned their inward-looking development
strategies for drastic trade liberalization programs. The supporters of these reforms claimed that the
exposure of home producers to additional import competition and easier access of plants to foreign
technology would enhance productivity in domestic industries. Despite the high profile of this topic,
surprisingly little is known about the actual effects of trade policy changes on plant’s productivity.
The theoretical trade literature offers conflicting predictions about the evolution of plant-level
productivity following a trade liberalization episode, especially in cases where imperfect competition is
present. Rodrik (1988, 1995) provides an excellent survey of the main issues. On one hand, trade
liberalization exposes domestic producers to foreign competition, reduces their market power, and might
force them to expand output and move down the average cost curve; this might result in the exploitation
of the economies of scale. Gains from scale economies are not very likely in developing countries, where
the increasing returns to scale are usually associated with the import-competing industries, whose output
is likely to contract as a result of intensified foreign competition. In models such as Rodrik (1988),
where plants invest in superior technology to reduce their cost, their incentive to cut costs might increase
with their market share. If trade liberalization reduces the domestic market shares of unshielded
domestic producers without expanding their international sales, their incentives to invest in improved
technology will decrease as protection ceases. This effect reduces the benefits of tariff reductions that
lower the relative prices of imported capital goods and ease access to foreign technology for domestic
plants.
Although trade liberalization facilitates procurement of foreign technology, it is questionable
whether domestic plants actually adopt better technology. A recent series of papers by Eaton and

2

Kortum (1996, 1997) models how the benefits of innovation are spread from one country to another
either through diffusion of technology or through the exchange of goods. They find that the impact of
diffusion of knowledge on productivity depends crucially on the proximity of a country to the technology
source and the flexibility of the domestic labor force. In light of many models predicting that trade
diffuses innovation and knowledge, it is also puzzling that studies of convergence of productivity across
countries such as Bernard and Jones (1996) find convergence in service rather than manufacturing sector,
which is extensively affected by international trade.
While trade theory has considered intraindustry gains from trade liberalization through expansion
of economies of scale, it has so far not explored the implications of plant heterogeneity within an
industry as most of the traditional trade models rely strongly on a representative plant assumption.
Recent work explaining plant-level data by Olley and Pakes (1996), Roberts and Tybout (1996), and Aw,
et. al. (1997), introduces evidence of a significant degree of plant-level heterogeneity within an industry.
The presence of plant-level heterogeneity suggests that trade liberalization may yield productivity
improvements by reshuffling the resources among plants within the same industry and that plant
dynamics such as exit may contribute significantly to this process. In particular, high levels of protection
may accommodate the coexistence of producers with different levels of productivity. By reducing
protection, trade liberalization lowers domestic prices, potentially forcing high cost producers to exit the
market. This would lead to a reallocation of output from less efficient to more efficient producers.
These productivity gains emerge only if the irreversibility of investment in capital equipment does not
impede the exit of the less productive plants.
Even if trade liberalization enhances plant productivity, such improvements do not occur without
costs associated with the exit of plants and large reallocations and displacements of labor and capital.
Fear of the initial costs of labor displacement and plant bankruptcies often deters governments from
exposing their domestic markets to foreign competition. From a policy perspective, it is therefore
important to evaluate the incidence of productivity gains. The goal of this paper is to provide such an

3

evaluation. I approach this topic in two steps. In the first step I estimate a production function to obtain
a measure of plant productivity. I estimate the production function semiparametrically to correct for the
presence of selection and simultaneity biases in the estimates of input coefficients required to construct a
productivity measure. I explicitly incorporate plant exit in the estimation to correct for the selection
problem induced by liquidated plants. In the second step I relate productivity changes to trade
liberalization exploiting the variation in productivity over time and across traded and nontraded-goods
sectors.
I quantify the incidence of productivity gains using a panel of Chilean manufacturing
establishments. Chile presents an interesting setting to study the dynamics of plants’ adjustment process
to trade liberalization. During the 1974 to 1979 period, Chile implemented a large trade liberalization
program. The country eliminated most of its non-tariff barriers and reduced the tariff rates, often
surpassing 100% in 1974, to a uniform across industries 10% ad valorem tariff in 1979 (Dornbusch, et.
al. (1994)). Its commitment to free trade persisted during the 1980s, except for a transitory period of
increased tariff protection starting in 1983 in response to the 1982-1983 recession. These temporary
measures peaked in 1984, when tariffs increased uniformly to 35%. Yet Chile remained strongly
committed to free trade: it introduced no non-tariff barriers and the tariffs declined to a 20% ad-valorem
level in mid 1985 (UNCTAD, 1992). Overall, the variation in protection during the early 1980s appears
very small relative to the extensive trade liberalization experiment in the late 1970s. These trade
developments coincide with massive plant exit, which seems to suggest that plant liquidation played a
significant role in the adjustment process. My data is ideal for addressing this issue: it covers 1979-1986,
a period of significant adjustment, and includes all Chilean manufacturing plants with ten or more
employees. The comprehensive nature of the data enables me to analyze the dynamics of the smaller
plants that are often ignored due to data limitations.

Many empirical papers reviewed in the next section of the paper have tackled the relationship
between trade protection and productivity, but the questions remain far from settled.1 This paper
improves on previous methodology in three ways: the identification of trade policy effects, the
measurement of plant-specific productivity, and the incorporation of plant exit in the estimation
procedure. One of the main problems in the empirical literature on trade and productivity has been the
identification of the effects of trade liberalization. The identification in studies such as Tybout et. al.
(1991) and Harrison (1994) relies on the comparison of plant behavior before and after a trade policy
change. As the authors recognize, this approach might attribute productivity variation originating from
some other shocks occurring concurrently with trade policy changes, to trade policy reform.
Furthermore, these studies presume that plants instantaneously react to the implementation of the policy
change. Yet, the uncertainty about the nature and sustainability of government policy, and possible lags
in plant adjustment to regime changes prevent us from pinpointing the exact timing of reform outcomes.
To identify trade policy effects this paper relies not only on productivity variation over time, but also on
variation across sectors. I distinguish between sectors that are affected directly by trade liberalization
(import-competing and export-oriented sectors) and the nontraded-goods sector to separate productivity
effects stemming from trade liberalization from productivity variation stemming from other sources. It is
very difficult to capture trade policy with a single variable. I thus check the robustness of my findings
using other measures of exposure to trade such as import to output ratios, tariffs, and exchange rates.
In order to obtain a measure of plant-level productivity I estimate a production function in which
plant efficiency is modeled as an unobserved plant specific effect. As discussed in detail in section one
of the paper, a plant’s private knowledge of its productivity affects its behavior and thus biases the
estimates of the coefficients on inputs such as labor and capital in the production function. Since the
measure of productivity depends on these estimates, their consistency is crucial for the analysis. Most of
the previous studies correct for the biases by relying on simplifying assumptions about the unobserved

plant heterogeneity such as time-invariance. I employ semiparametric estimation as in Olley and Pakes
(1996) to account for unobserved plant heterogeneity. This approach yields a plant-specific, timevarying productivity measure based on consistent estimates of the production function coefficients; it
requires no specific functional form, and is tractable enough to incorporate in the estimation process. A
further improvement to previous work is that I explicitly incorporate dynamics like plant exit in the
analysis. In particular, I adjust my estimation for the selection bias that is introduced by exiting plants.
In the second stage I then investigate whether plant exit contributes to aggregate productivity
improvements and whether the effects of exit differ across the plants producing export-oriented, importcompeting and nontraded goods.
My research yields several important findings. First, my results show that selection bias induced
by plant closings and simultaneity bias induced by plant dynamics significantly affect the magnitude of
the capital coefficient in the production function. After I adjust for self selection and simultaneity, the
estimate of the capital coefficient increases on average more than doubles relative to the OLS estimate
for 5 out of 8 industries where the selection outweighs the simultaneity bias, and decreases on average by
22% relative to the OLS estimates elsewhere. This suggests that semiparametric estimation of a
production function provides a useful alternative to techniques used in previous studies. Second, I find
support for productivity improvements related to trade liberalization. I show that after trade
liberalization, the productivity of plants in the import-competing sectors grew 3 to 10% more than in the
nontraded-goods sectors. This finding is robust to several econometric specifications and measures of
foreign competition. It suggests that exposure to foreign competition forced plants in sectors that used to
be shielded from the outside competition to trim their fat. Third, I find that exiting plants are on average
8% less productive than the plants that continue to produce. Although it is hard to pinpoint the exact
mechanism of productivity improvements, this result implies that plant exit also contributes to the
reshuffling of resources within the economy. Evidence from the industry-level aggregate productivity

6

indices additionally suggests that the reallocation of market shares and resources from less to more
efficient producers is an important channel of productivity improvements.
My findings have important policy implications. Since productivity improvements partially stem
from the reshuffling of the resources in the economy, it is important to eliminate barriers to plant
turnover. Hurdles such as institutional arrangements that discourage the bankruptcy of less efficient
plants, for example, have been blamed to curb economic growth in recent discussions of East Asian
economic crisis in popular press (NYT, September 8, 1998). Finally, my empirical evidence indicates
that channels other than economies of scale yield intraindustry improvements from trade liberalization.
This suggests that incorporating plant heterogeneity in models exploring trade policy effects would be a
fruitful area of future research in trade theory.
The next section of the paper provides an overview of the empirical issues, and reviews previous
work in this area. Section 3 introduces the model. Section 4 looks at data and descriptive statistics.
Section 5 discusses the estimation results. Section 6 contains my conclusions.
2. Empirical Issues and Previous Literature
Most of the literature on trade liberalization and productivity obtains a plant-level productivity
measure by estimating a production function. Let us describe plant i’s technology at time t by a CobbDouglas production function:
(1)

yit = β 0 + β xit + β k kit + eit
eit = ω it + µit

where yit is gross output, xit is a vector of variable intermediate inputs such as labor and materials, and kit
is capital used by plant i at time t. I express all variables in logarithms so that the input coefficients
represent input elasticities. Plant specific term eit is composed of a plant-specific efficiency ωit that is
known by the plant but not by the econometrician and an unexpected productivity shock µit that is not
known either to the plant or the econometrician. I am interested in the former term. In this framework,
any plant-level productivity measure relies on the difference between a plant’s actual output and

7

predicted output. It is, then, crucial to obtain consistent estimates of the coefficients in the production
function. A plant’s private knowledge of its productivity ωit affects its decision about exiting or staying
in the market and its choice of hiring labor, purchasing materials and investing into new capital. Yet ωit
is unobserved by the econometrician. This information asymmetry introduces two biases in my
estimation: simultaneity and selection biases. Although the trade liberalization literature has addressed
the first one, it has so far disregarded selection bias stemming from plants’ exit.
Let us first focus on the simultaneity bias that arises because a plant’s private knowledge of its
productivity affects its choice of inputs. If more productive plants are more likely to hire more workers
and invest in capital due to higher current and anticipated future profitability, ordinary least squares
estimation (OLS) of a production function may lead to estimates of the input coefficients that are higher
than their true values. Previous studies have adjusted for this bias in various manners. Comparing preand post-trade reform cross-sectional data on the Chilean manufacturing sector, Tybout et. al. (1991)
impose normal distribution on the unobserved heterogeneity, assume that the plant-specific efficiency is
uncorrelated with the plant’s choice of inputs, and use maximum likelihood estimation. Studies such as
Harrison (1994) that employ plant-level panel data have corrected for simultaneity bias by assuming that
the unobserved plant-specific efficiency is time-invariant. I can then rewrite the production function
specified in (1) as:

yit = β 0 + β xit + β k kit + ω i + µit
where ωi is the plant-specific, time-invariant productivity and estimate it using a fixed effects model.
Although the fixed effects model partially solves the simultaneity problem, it only removes the effects of
the time-invariant plant’s productivity component. During times of large structural adjustments such as
trade liberalization, the assumption of unchanging productivity seems worrisome, and the fixed effects
methodology may lead to biased estimates of the input coefficients. More importantly, I am ultimately
interested in how plant efficiency evolves over time in response to a change in a trade policy regime.
The assumption that a plant’s productivity is constant over time prevents me from tackling this question.

8

To correct for this shortcoming, Cornwell, et.al. (1990) propose a plant-specific and time-varying
efficiency that can be described as a quadratic function of time. This methodology is also used in Liu
(1993), and Liu and Tybout (1996) for Chile. Using the notation in (1) their specification of a production
function yields:

yit = β 0 + β xit + β k kit + ω it + µit

ω it = α1i + α 2i t + α 3i t 2
They first estimate the production function by fixed effects to obtain the input coefficient vector

β. They then calculate the residuals by subtracting the actual from the predicted values of output, and for
each plant i regress this residual measure on a constant, time, and time squared (1,t ,t2). They construct a
productivity measure using the estimates of the coefficients from the last regression (α1i,α2i,α3i).
Although their approach improves on the fixed effects methodology, it requires a parametric
specification of productivity and many degrees of freedom are lost in the estimation process. Moreover,
in the presence of simultaneity bias this procedure still uses fixed effects estimation in the first step that
provides the residual for the construction of the productivity measure. So although the measure is timevarying, it is still likely to be based on biased coefficients. In the next section I propose a plant-specific,
time-varying productivity measure that requires no specific functional form assumption and is based on
unbiased input coefficients of the production function.
The trade liberalization literature has so far abstracted from the effects of self-selection induced
by plant closings. Unlike previous studies, I explicitly address the selection issue. In my sample, I only
observe those plants that continue to produce. A plant decides to stay in business if its expected future
profits exceed its liquidation value. A more productive plant is more profitable today, it anticipates
higher profits in the future, and is therefore less likely to close down. If a plant’s profits are also
positively related to the size of its capital stock, given the level of productivity, plants that are endowed
with more capital are more likely to continue their operations than are plants with a lower capital stock.
The expectation of productivity ωit conditional on the surviving plants is then no longer zero, but a

9

decreasing function of capital, yielding a downward bias on the coefficient on capital. Liu (1993) and
Liu and Tybout (1996) are the only studies that examine plant exit; they compare the aggregate
productivity indices for exiting and surviving plants in the case of Chile. Yet, the comparison is based on
the coefficients that are not adjusted for the selection bias induced by plant exit.
The literature on the links between trade liberalization and productivity presents conflicting
evidence. Tybout et. al. (1991) find scant support for productivity improvements in the Chilean
manufacturing sector after the trade liberalization. Bernard and Jones (1996) study productivity
convergence across countries on a sectoral level. They find that productivity growth does not converge
in manufacturing sectors, despite the belief that international trade flows expedite this process. Using
plant-level panel data from the Ivory Coast, Harrison (1994) finds a positive correlation between trade
reform and productivity growth. Tybout and Westbrook (1995) report productivity improvements related
to trade liberalization in Mexico. Furthermore, some of these studies are based on the data sets that
oversample large and medium-sized manufacturing plants. Chilean data also includes small
establishments, which are anecdotally more likely to quickly respond to the changes in the environment,
therefore presenting an opportunity to study an important part of plant dynamics. It is this conflicting
evidence in addition to the above mentioned econometric issues that motivates the present study.
3. Empirical Model
3.1 Theoretical Background
I base my econometric analysis upon the theoretical and empirical work on plant profitmaximizing behavior in a dynamic framework presented in Ericson and Pakes (1995) and Olley and
Pakes (1996). Although Olley and Pakes (1996) address the uncertainty regarding returns to investment
in research and development stemming from the regulatory changes in the U.S. telecommunication
industry, they provide a good framework to analyze plant dynamics resulting from trade liberalization.
Plants belonging to an industry face same input prices and market structure, but they differ in their levels
of efficiency and are subject to plant specific uncertainty about future market conditions and investment.

10

A plant’s goal is to maximize the expected value of its current and future profits (net cash flow). In each
period, a plant first decides whether to close down or continue to produce. A plant continues to produce
if its expected future net cash flow exceeds its liquidation value. Conditional on staying in the market,
the plant then chooses its inputs. This renders the plant’s optimal decision regarding exit and input
choices as a function of its observable characteristics such as capital and investment. The plant specific
uncertainty about the future market conditions affects these plant choices and leads plants to follow
different efficiency paths. This set up is consistent with imperfect competition. In each period, firms
consider the market structure and the actions of other firms when making their choice about exit and
investment. To capture these interactions among firms, a firm’s profits (and ultimately the equilibrium
exit and investment rule) are indexed by time.
To elaborate, in a given industry j, the profits Πijt of a plant i at time t are a function of its capital
kijt and unobserved productivity ωijt (kijt and ωijt are plant state variables):2

Π ijt = f t (kijt , ω ijt )
I assume that each plant can easily adjust its labor force and the use of intermediate materials and treat
labor and materials as variable inputs, whereas it takes time to adjust the capital stock. This is not a bad
assumption for Chile since it significantly liberated its labor laws and practices in the late 1970s.
Overall, the plant’s problem can be described by the value function for the dynamic program:

{

}

Vt (ω t , kt ) = max Lt ,sup Π t (ω t , kt ) − c(it ) + dE Vt +1 (ω t +1 , kt +1 ) Ωit 
and capital accumulation equation:
(2)

kt +1 = (1 − δ )kt + it

where L is the value of the plant if it liquidates, c() represents the cost associated with investment, d is
the discount factor, Ωt is the information at time t, and δ is the capital depreciation rate. In order for the
model to be econometrically tractable, productivity evolves as a 1st order Markov Process which assures

11

that the plant’s state variables in the current period depend on the value of the state variables in the
previous period. The market conditions that affect plant's profits, but are the same for all plants in a
given time period t and industry are captured by the index t.
As shown in Ericson and Pakes (1995) the solution to this dynamic program gives rise to a
Markov Perfect Equilibrium strategy for plant’s choice of exit and investment. The plant continues to
produce if its unobserved productivity exceeds some threshold value ωt that is a function of the plant’s
capital:

(3)

if ω t ≥ ω t ( kt )

1
Χt = 
0

otherwise,

where Χt=1 denotes that a plant stays in the market in period t and Χt=0 denotes a plant’s exit. A plant
chooses its investment based on its beliefs about future productivity and profitability. Its decision to
invest it , then depends on its capital stock and productivity:
(4)

it = it (ω t , k t )

The investment and exit rule can be used in the estimation of a production function to yield a measure of
productivity. This framework captures the market structure in which the firms compete with each other.
The competitive conditions that plants face in a given industry are depicted by a time index in the profit
function, and the time index in the investment function and the cut off productivity in the exit rule. In the
estimation, I allow the investment and exit function to vary over time.
Trade liberalization affects a plant's exit and investment decisions and its productivity process.
Differences in the exposure of plants to international competition might lead to divergence in their
behavior and different evolution of their productivity paths. For example, trade liberalization might force
the plants to use their resources more productively and trim their fat. In this framework the industry level
productivity improvements induced by trade liberalization could stem from several sources: the exit of

2

Each industry is characterized by its own profit function. I omit the industry and plant subscripts in my notation in
the rest of the paper.

12

less efficient plants, the reshuffling of the resources and output from less to more productive plants, or
within plant improvements in productivity--i.e. plants becoming leaner by reducing their X-inefficiencies
or eliminating some other agency problem, or by acquiring better inputs from abroad.
3.2 Empirical Implementation
I incorporate exit and investment rules into the estimation of a production function to identify the
coefficients on capital and variable inputs such as skilled and unskilled labor and materials. The
semiparametric procedure that yields consistent estimates of the labor and capital coefficients involves
three steps. In this section, I first summarize the estimation procedure and then discuss its
implementation in this paper.
Let us first focus on the coefficients on variable inputs, labor, and materials. Within each period
a plant can adjust its variable inputs to innovation in its private knowledge about its unobserved
productivity ωt. By inverting the investment rule specified in equation (4), unobserved productivity can
be expressed as a function of observable investment and capital:
(5)

ω t = it−1 (it , k t ) = θ t (it , k t )

Substituting (5) into (1) yields
(6)

yt = β xt + λt (kt , it ) + µt ,

where
(7)

λt (kt , it ) = β 0 + β k kt + θ t (kt , it ).

I can then obtain consistent estimates of the vector of coefficients on variable inputs β by estimating the
production function in equation (1) using the partially linear regression model in (6), where the function

λt is modeled as a polynomial series expansion in capital and investment. Since λt controls for
unobserved productivity ωt, the error term in the production function is no longer correlated with a

13

plant’s choice of labor hiring and materials, and the coefficient vector β is consistent.3 This specification
of productivity is plant-specific and time-varying, and it does not require productivity to be a function
with a specific parametric form as in Cornwell et. al. (1990).
After identifying the vector of variable input coefficients β, I still need to separate the effect of
capital on output from its effect on plant's decision to invest. If productivity is serially correlated, current
productivity contains information that a plant might incorporate in forming its expectations about its
future profitability. If the plant is not myopic, it bases its investment decision at time t on its expectation
of its future profitability and hence its productivity at time t. Since capital at t+1 includes investment
from the previous period it by (2), capital and productivity are then correlated at time t+1. In particular,
capital at t+1 is correlated with the expectation of productivity, E (ω it +1 |ω it , kit +1 ) = ω it +1 − ξ it +1
(productivity is here decomposed into expected and unanticipated parts). Expectation of the next period's
productivity is a function of productivity in this period. Let us denote this function as g (ωt ) . I can
substitute the expression for ωt from (5) into g() and then the expression for θt from (7) to yield:4

E[ω t +1 | ω t , kt +1 ] = g (ω t ) − β o = g (θ t (it , kt )) − β o = g (λt − β k kt ) − β o

(8)

Substituting (8) into (1) at t+1 yields

yt +1 − β xt +1 = β o + β k kt +1 + E[ω t +1 | ω t , kt +1 ] + ξ t +1 + µt +1
= β k kt +1 + g (λt − β k kt ) + ξt +1 + µt +1
Thus, I control for the expectation of productivity in (8) with observable variables. If no plant exits the
sample, controlling for the expectation of productivity at t+1 conditional on the information available at
time t yields consistent estimates of the coefficient on capital in the estimation of the above production
function.
Yet, I still need to consider that in my sample, I only observe those plants that select to stay in
the market. A plant continues to produce only if its expectation of future profitability exceeds its

Andrews (1991) shows that partially linear regression model with the series estimator of the nonlinear part yields
consistent and asymptotically normal estimates of coefficients on the linear part of the model, in my case, β.

liquidation value. Otherwise, the plant exits. Using the terminology of the exit rule in (3), a plant stays
in the market at time t+1 only if its productivity at t+1 exceeds some threshold value ωt+1. This
threshold depends on the plant’s capital stock. As explained in section 2, this truncation leads to a
nonzero expectation of productivity that is correlated with capital, thus biasing the coefficient on capital
in the estimation of a production function. Conditional on a plant staying in the market, the expression
for its expected productivity at t+1 becomes

E[ω t +1 | ω t , kt +1 , X t +1 = 1] = E[ω t +1 | ω t , ω t +1 > ω t +1 (kt +1 )] = Φ(ω t , ω t +1 ) − β o
(9)

where
Φ(ω t , ω t +1 ) ≡ E[ω t +1 | ω t , ω t +1 > ω t +1 (kt +1 )] + β o

The expectation of future productivity is thus a function of productivity in the previous period, ωt, and
the cut-off productivity, ωt+1. The effect of the latter attenuates the coefficient on capital in the
production function. In view of the substantial plant closings in Chile, the self-selection of plants
probably plays a significant role in the adjustment process. I already know how to control for ωt. Next, I
find a way to control for ωt+1 in estimating the production function.
I can extract information about the cut-off productivity ωt+1 by evaluating the probability that a
plant continues to produce at time t+1. The probability of a plant staying in the market at time t+1 can
be modeled as a function of its capital and investment:

Pr( X t +1 = 1)
= Pr{ω t +1 > ω t +1 (kt +1 ) | ω t +1 (kt +1 ), ω t }
(10)

= pt (ω t +1 (kt +1 ), ω t )
= pt (ω t +1 (kt , it ), ω t )
= pt (kt , it ) ≡ Pt

where the first line follows from the exit rule (3), the third line follows from the capital accumulation
equation (2), and the fourth line from the investment rule (4). The intuition is simple. A plant makes its
exit decision based on whether its expected future profits exceed its liquidation value. Since a plant’s

4

A constant β0 cannot be identified separately from the polynomial expansion in investment and capital.

15

productivity depends on its investment and capital, its probability of staying in the market is then also a
function of its investment and capital. Any selection correction is more credible if it does not rely solely
on distributional or functional form assumptions, but also on exclusion restrictions: variables that affect
the probability that a plant exits the market, but do not affect a plant's output. Investment can be viewed
as such a variable because it does not affect current output (assuming it takes time for investment to
become productive), but it does affect the future profitability of a plant, and therefore its exit decision.
Assuming that function pt is invertible, the threshold productivity value, ωt+1, can be expressed as
a function of a plant's survival probability, Pt, and its productivity, ωt. Φ(ω t , ω t +1 ) from (9) can thus be
rewritten as a function of productivity in the previous period, ωt, and the probability a plant stays in the
market, Pt:

{

}

Φ(ω t , ω t +1 ) = Φ ω t , p t−1 ( Pt , ω t ) = Φ(ω t , Pt ) .
Moreover, as discussed at the beginning of this section, I can express productivity ωt using (5) and (7), so
that Φ(ω t , Pt ) becomes Φ(ω t , Pt ) = Φ(λt − β k kt , Pt ) . After these substitutions, we can rewrite the
production function in (1) at t+1 as
(11)

yt +1 − β xt +1 = β k kt +1 + Φ(λt − β k kt , Pt ) + ξ t +1 + µt +1

This is the equation I estimate in the final stage of estimation to obtain a consistent coefficient on capital

β k.
Several estimation issues should be pointed out. First, when I estimate the partially linear
regression model in (6), I use a fourth order polynomial expansion in capital and investment to
approximate λt.5 I allow the polynomial to vary over time since the investment rule is indexed by time.6
This time index accounts for changes in the market structure that firms might adjust to over time.

5

The coefficients on the variables of interest and the sum of squares did not vary substantively when the reported
polynomial or a higher order polynomial was used to estimate (6).
6
I distinguish between 1979-1981, 1982-1983, and 1984-1986 by including time indicators corresponding to these
periods. I also interact time indicators with investment and capital.

16

This estimation yields an estimate of the coefficient vector β on variable inputs, βˆ , and an estimate of

λt, λˆt , that are subsequently used to estimate (11). Estimation of (11) also requires an estimate of a
plant’s probability of staying in the market, Pt. Expression (10) shows that the probability of staying in
the market, Pt, is a function of investment and capital. I estimate this probability using a probit with
regressors that are terms in the fourth order polynomial expansion of capital and investment. 7 As in the
estimation of (6), I allow the polynomial to vary over time since the exit rule is indexed by time to
account for changes in the market structure across periods. Finally, the estimates of the polynomial
expansion lambda λt, λˆt , the coefficients on variable inputs β, βˆ , and the estimate of the survival
probability Pt, Pˆt , can be used to eliminate the selection and simultaneity bias and obtain a consistent
estimate of the coefficient on capital βk in (11). Since the equation is nonlinear in the coefficient on
capital βk, I utilize the non-linear least squares technique, using a third order polynomial series expansion
in Pˆt and ωˆ t = (λˆt − β k kt ) to control for Φ():8
3− m 3

3− m 3

j =0 m =0

j =0 m =0

Φ(ω t , Pt ) = ∑ ∑ β mjωˆ tm Pˆt j =∑ ∑ β mj (λˆt − β k kt ) m Pˆt j
Second, unlike Olley and Pakes (1996), this paper uses series approximation in all the stages of
estimation. While the use of a series approximation for λt in (6) yields estimators with known limiting
properties (Andrews (1991)), the use of the series approximation to control for Φ() in (11) yields an
estimator that does not have a well-defined limiting distribution. Pakes and Olley (1995) prove
asymptotic results for the case when kernel estimator is used for Φ(). No asymptotic results are proven in
the case that uses the series estimator for Φ(). Nevertheless, the use of the series estimator has several
advantages. First, it is easier and faster than the kernel approximation. Second, Pakes and Olley (1995)

7

The fit and the predicted survival probabilities do not vary much when either the reported or the higher order
polynomials are used.
8
The coefficients on the variables of interest and the sum of squares did not vary much when the reported
polynomial or the higher order polynomial were used to estimate (11).

17

show that for their particular application, the results based on the series estimator in (11) do not differ
much from the results obtained using the kernel estimator, so they argue that the convergence of the
series estimator in the last stage of estimation is a technicality that still needs to be proven. I therefore
use the series estimator. However, since the limiting distribution has not been worked out, I compute and
report bootstrap estimates of the standard errors.
Third, the Olley and Pakes (1996) procedure relies on the observations whose investment is
nonzero. In order to be able to express unobserved productivity as a function of investment and capital
using the optimal investment rule (4), investment needs to be a strictly monotonic function of unobserved
productivity. Pakes (1994) shows that this is achieved as long as the marginal productivity of capital is
an increasing function of a firm’s unobserved productivity, and investment is strictly positive. In my
sample, many plants make no investments. In order to check whether the use of the observations with
nonzero investment significantly affects my findings, I also estimate production functions using only the
plants with positive investment and compare the estimates to those obtained when all plant observations
are used. As discussed in section 5.1 of the paper, the estimates are in most cases relatively close, so the
use of zero investment observations does not seem as problematic in practice. More importantly, my
estimates of the relationship between trade and productivity discussed in section 5.3, which is the main
goal of this paper, do not change at all if I use the measure of productivity constructed from production
function estimates based solely on the observations with strictly positive investment.
Finally, as is common in the literature, the estimation of a production function uses the real value
of output rather than physical units of output produced by a given plant as a measure of output. The
value of output is deflated using a four-digit industry price index. A measure of productivity based on
the real value of output might not reflect the ranking of firms in their productivity if plants charge
different markups. Differentiating between the true productivity and the plant specific markups across
plants within an industry is a big challenge in the productivity literature. Harrison (1994) is one of the
few studies that explicitly models plant markups. She assumes that plants are Cournot competitors and

18

allows the markups to vary over time and across industries, but not across plants within an industry. In
her setup, this is the same as assuming that all firms within an industry have the same market share.
In order to empirically distinguish the true efficiency from the plant specific markups within an
industry, one would need plant level price data. Otherwise, one needs to impose some assumptions on
the joint distribution of productivity and markups. Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum (1999) provide
an example. They set up a model in which they show that, on average, a more efficient plant charges a
higher markup. Measured productivity based on the real value of output is then on average higher for
plants with higher efficiency. Without detailed price data, one cannot identify if such a relationship
holds. This caveat should be considered when interpreting the results in section 5 of the paper. In my
estimation of the relationship between measured productivity and trade, I control for plant specific
markups with plant fixed effects. If plants change markups over time and a positive relationship between
efficiency and markups does not hold, the interpretation of the results in section five is more convoluted.
4. Data and Preliminary Results
4.1 Data
This paper draws on a census of Chilean manufacturing plants employing ten or more workers
provided by Chile’s National Institute of Statistics. The panel data set of 4379 plants extends from 1979
to 1986. A unit of observation is a plant, not a firm, however, over 90% of the plants are single-plant
establishments. The data set and the variable definitions and construction are described in detail in Liu
(1993) and Tybout (1996).9 Capital, investment, intermediate materials, value added, and output are
expressed in constant 1980 pesos. Skilled and unskilled labor is measured by the total number of

9

I use the information on 4379 plants after eliminating those with incomplete information. The capital variable was
initially constructed using a perpetual inventory method by Liu (1993) and is described in detail in Tybout (1996). I
have reconstructed the variable so that the capital stock at time t does not contain the investment at time t. Since the
balance sheet information was only available for the plants in 1980 and 1981, capital measures are based on the book
value of capital in those two periods. In my capital variable, I use figures based on the 1981 book value of capital if
both 1980 and 1981 are available. Otherwise, capital measure based on the 1980 book value of capital was used. I
experimented with several options and all capital measures are highly correlated.

19

employees in each skill group working in a plant.10 Descriptive statistics for the sample are given in
Tables 1and 2. I characterize each plant in terms of its trade orientation, as being in the export-oriented,
the import-competing, or the nontraded goods sector. The trade orientation of an industry is determined
at a four-digit ISIC level, on the basis of Chilean trade balance in that particular industry. The data used
to compute the trade balance are exports and imports from the UN Yearbook of International Trade
Statistics and Statistics Canada CD-ROM. A more detailed classification in the Statistics Canada enables
me to improve on the definitions provided by Tybout (1992) that are only at the three-digit ISIC level.
Although I have experimented with different cut-off points, all of the tables reported in this paper use the
following definition of trade orientation.11 Plants that belong to a four-digit ISIC industry that exports
more than 15% of its total output are characterized as export-oriented. Plants that belong to a four-digit
ISIC industry whose ratio of imports to total domestic output exceeds 15% are characterized as importcompeting. The rest of the plants belong to the nontraded-goods sector. Tables 3 and 4 provide import
to output and export to output ratios for specific three and four digit ISIC sectors in my data.
Defining trade orientation in this manner raises two concerns: the presence of intra industry
trade and the endogeneity of the definition. Neither of these presents a problem in the Chilean data.
Intra industry trade was rarely an issue within three or four digit ISIC classifications. The Grubel-Lloyd
index of intra industry trade averaged .30 from 1979 to 1986 on a four-digit ISIC level, and .35 on a
three-digit ISIC level. The median import-output ratio was .257, the median export-output ratio was
.017. As Table 3 and 4 indicate and Figure 1 illustrates, in the sectors that had both imports and exports,
one of the categories significantly prevailed over the other so that the trade orientation was easily
determined.
The endogeneity of trade orientation could arise from the traditional omitted variable problem:
unobserved factors that affect a plant's productivity might also affect a plant's trade orientation during

10

The data set does not provide the information on hours worked. It also does not provide the information on when a
plant was established.
11
In most cases, the results are robust to definitions based on any cut-off point between 10 to 25% (20% in textiles).

20

trade liberalization. Most obviously, trade liberalization could have changed also a plant's trade
orientation. One way of solving this problem is to define trade orientation of a sector using information
on imports and exports preceding the sample period. Interestingly, trade orientation of the three- and
four-digit ISIC industries does not change much over time, which implies that the endogeneity does not
seem to be a concern in the case of Chile. In my regression analysis I also use plant fixed effects, so that
this specification eliminates the effects of any permanent unobserved plant characteristic that influence
trade orientation and plant productivity. Moreover, Chile underwent a comprehensive reform that
enhanced the economy as a whole. I could have used a measure such as tariff concessions or changes in
protection. Yet, the change in tariffs does not completely depict the change in the trading environment.
Some sectors might not experience an increase in imports regardless of the drop in tariffs because of
transportation costs or other barriers to trade. Category 3117, manufacturing of bakery products is a
good example. Despite low tariffs, it involves a good that is nontraded because it is perishable.
Therefore, a definition of a trade orientation of a sector based on trade balance seems more appropriate.
In addition, if one considers political economy issues, measures such as tariffs might suffer from the
endogeneity issues as well (Trefler 1993), i.e. less productive industries might be more likely to lobby
and receive higher tariffs. One is unlikely to worry about this in terms of Chile during the 1980s,
however, since all tariff changes were uniform for all manufacturing sectors. Nevertheless, in the
estimation I employ other measures of trade and protection such as tariffs and import to output ratios to
check the robustness of my results. All measures lead to the same findings.
4.2 Preliminary Analysis
The Chilean manufacturing sector experienced significant changes following the trade
liberalization period, and plant exit played an important role in the adjustment process.12 As Table 5

12

Plant entry is also an interesting topic. This paper does not focus on entry because the magnitude of entry was
much smaller than the magnitude of exit. It is also unclear how to correct for selection bias from entry because we
do not know the population of possible entrants. However, selection bias due to entry might not be that important in
this particular application. The average capital level of entering plants is not statistically different from the average
capital level of the incumbents.

21

indicates, 35% of the plants that were active in 1979 ceased their production by 1986. The liquidated
plants accounted for 25% of the 1979 total manufacturing labor force, 13% of the 1979 investment, and
16% of the 1979 manufacturing output.13 Evidence in Table 5 suggests that the incidence of exit varied
across plants in the export-oriented, import-competing, and nontraded goods sectors. Out of the 35% of
the plants that exited the market, 13% belonged to the export-oriented sectors, 40% belonged to the
import-competing sector, and 47% exited from the nontraded-goods sector. Similarly, of the 25% of the
workers that were employed in 1979 but lost their job thereafter, 19% are displaced from the exportoriented sector, 43% from the import-competing sectors, and 38% from the nontraded goods sector.
Finally, out of 16% of the 1979 output attributable to the exiting plants, 15% belonged to the plants
exiting from the export-oriented sectors, 42% to the plants from the import-competing sectors, and 43%
to the plants from the nontraded-goods sectors.
The above figures suggest that plants in the import-competing sectors experienced the largest
displacements in terms of employment, whereas plant closings did not play as significant of a role for the
plants in the export-oriented industries. Yet, these results might be misleading due to the small size of
the export-oriented sector. The bottom section of Table 5 depicts the contribution of plants that are
active in 1979 but not in 1986 by using the shares of employment and output that these plants had in the
corresponding sectors. 42% of the plants in the export-oriented sector that were active in 1979 are no
longer active in 1986, these plants accounted for 30% of employment, 17% of investment and 13% of
output in the export-oriented sector in 1979. Similarly, 38% of plants in the import competing sector,
and 32% of plants in the non-traded sector, accounting for 26% and 22% of the 1979 employment in the
corresponding sectors respectively, are active in 1979 but no longer produce in 1986.
Overall, these descriptive statistics suggest that exit seems to play an important role in the
adjustment process after the Chilean trade liberalization. Part of these exit patterns potentially stems
13

Plants could either exit the data because they go bankrupt or their number of workers falls below 10. In this
application, I do not count as exit plants that disappear from the data due to low number of employees and then

22

from the large recession in 1982 and 1983. Regardless of the causes of the exit, I expect a large
attenuation of the capital coefficient in the estimation procedures that ignore self-selection induced by
plant closings. This would translate into skewed productivity measures.
5. Estimation Results
5.1 Estimates of the Production Function Coefficients
Table 6 presents estimates of the input coefficients from the production function specified in
equation (1). I follow the rest of the literature and estimate the production function on a two or three
digit ISIC industry level for all individual manufacturing industries: food manufacturing, textiles and
apparel, manufacture of wood and wood products, manufacture of paper and paper products, chemical
industry, glass, basic metals and manufacture of machinery and equipment. 14 This implies that plants
producing various four digit ISIC goods within a three or two digit ISIC classification use the same factor
proportions, but are imperfect substitutes in consumption, which can lead to different trade orientation
within an industry. This assumption is in line with the models of intra-industry trade where goods
require the same factor input coefficients in their productions, but play different role in a country's trade
(some are exported, some are import-competing and some are nontraded). Difference in their exposure to
international competition might lead to difference in their behavior and differences in the response of
their productivity to international shocks. I include skilled and unskilled labor, materials and capital as
factors of production.
Table 6 reports the estimates of the coefficients based on the OLS, fixed effects, and
semiparametric estimation, first using only plants that never exited the sample (balanced panel) and then
the full sample (unbalanced panel). According to the theory the coefficients on variable inputs such as
skilled and unskilled labor and materials should be biased upwards in the OLS estimation, whereas the

appear again later in the data. I also do not count as exit a plant switching its ISIC industry sector. Most of these
switches occur on a four digit ISIC level, so they do not affect the estimates of production function.
14
In an older version of the paper I have also repeated the analysis on a more disaggregated three digit ISIC level
and the level of aggregation did not affect my final results. I have also specified and estimated production function
in the value added form. Although the coefficients differ, the main findings of the study do not change.

23

direction of the bias on the capital coefficient is ambiguous. My results confirm this. The estimates of
the coefficient on labor, materials, and capital based on semiparametric estimation reported in column 5
significantly differ from the OLS and fixed effects estimates. They move in a direction that points at
successful elimination of simultaneity and selection bias.
Let us illustrate this point on the input coefficients obtained for the food processing industry.
The skilled labor coefficient from semiparametric estimation (.098) in column 5 is lower than the OLS
estimate in column 3 (.131) based on unbalanced panel. The above finding holds for all industries in my
sample but paper, as well as for unskilled labor and materials.15 Moreover, my estimates of the
coefficient on capital exhibit the biggest movement in the direction that points at the successful
elimination of the selection and simultaneity bias. Semiparametric estimation yields estimates that are
from 45% to over 300% higher than those obtained in the OLS estimations in industries where the
coefficient increases. For example, my estimate of the coefficient on capital in column 5 in food
processing industry is .079 compared to the OLS estimate .052 (column 3) and the fixed effects estimate
.014 (column 4). This finding holds in 5 out of 8 industries reported in Table 6 and reconfirms the
necessity of adjusting the estimation procedure for the self-selection induced by the exiting plants in a
country like Chile during the early 1980s. In three industries (textiles, paper, machinery) the coefficient
on capital actually declines, which might indicate that the selection bias is less important than the
simultaneity bias. The input coefficients suggest the existence of increasing returns to scale in all of the
sectors, with only slight presence in food processing and the highest in wood and glass industry.
Previous literature has often used fixed effects estimation that relies on the temporal variation in
plant behavior to pinpoint the input coefficients. The fixed effects coefficients are reported in columns 2
and 4, and they are often much lower than those in the OLS or the semiparametric procedure, especially
for capital. This is not surprising since the fixed effect estimation relies on the intertemporal variation
within a plant, thus overemphasizing any measurement error. Semiparametric estimation therefore

24

provides a useful alternative for estimation of a production function to techniques used in previous
studies.
As discussed in section 3.2, semiparametric estimation from Olley and Pakes (1996) technically
requires plants to have strictly positive investment. Table 6a compares the semiparametric estimates of
the production function based on all plant observations (column 1) and based only on plants with strictly
positive investment. In most cases, the coefficients do not vary significantly. The exceptions are the
coefficient on the unskilled labor and the coefficient on capital in paper and machinery. However, these
are also the two coefficients with the highest standard errors. More importantly, my estimates of the
relationship between trade and productivity, discussed in section 5.3, do not change when I use the
measure of productivity constructed from the production function estimates based solely on the
observations with strictly positive investment.
5.2 Productivity Measure and Aggregate Industry Productivity Indices
I use the input coefficients based on semiparametric estimation from column 5 in Table 6 to
construct a measure of plant productivity. In every industry, the productivity index is obtained by
subtracting plant i’s predicted output from its actual output at time t and then comparing it relative to a
reference plant r. This methodology has been employed in several studies using panel or cross sectional
data such as Aw et. al. (1997), Klette (1996) and Caves et. al (1981). It insures that the productivity
index has the desired properties such as transitivity and insensitivity to the units of measurement.16 I
obtain such an index by simply subtracting a productivity of a reference plant in a base year (plant with
mean output and mean input levels in 1979) from an individual plant's productivity measure:

prit = yit − βˆlslits − βˆlu litu − βˆ m mit − βˆ k kit − ( yr − yˆ r )
where
and

yr = yit
yˆ r = βˆls lit s + βˆlu litu + βˆm mit + βˆk kit

15

The unskilled labor coefficient obtained by OLS is actually lower than the coefficient obtained by semiparametric
method in glass and basic metals.
16
For a review of this literature see Good et. al. (1997).

25

where the bar over a variable indicates a mean over all plants in a base year. So, yr is the mean log output
of plants in my base year, 1979, and y!r is the predicted mean output in 1979. This productivity measure
presents a logarithmic deviation of a plant from the mean industry practice in a base year.
To check the importance of productivity gains stemming from the reshuffling of resources from
the less to more efficient plants I compute aggregate industry productivity measures for each year. In a
given year the aggregate industry productivity measure Wt is a weighted average of the plants’ individual
unweighted productivities prit with an individual plant’s weight sit corresponding to its output’s share in
total industry output in a particular year. Further, as in Olley and Pakes (1996) I decompose the weighted
aggregate productivity measure Wt into two parts: the unweighted aggregate productivity measure and the
total covariance between a plant’s share of the industry output and its productivity:

Wt = ∑ sit prit = pr t + ∑ ( sit − st )( prit − pr t )
i

i

where the bar over a variable denotes a mean over all plants in a given year. The covariance component
represents the contribution to the aggregate weighted productivity resulting from the reallocation of
market share and resources across plants of different productivity levels. If the covariance is positive, it
indicates that more output is produced by the more efficient plants. So, if trade liberalization induces a
reallocation of resources within industries from less to more productive plants, the latter measure should
be positive, and increasing over time in my sample.
The results of the above decomposition for the industries in my sample are reported in Table 7 in
terms of growth relative to 1979. Aggregate productivity, unweighted productivity and covariance
growth are reported in columns 1, 2 and 3, respectively. For each industry, the growth figures are
normalized, so that they can be interpreted as growth relative to 1979. Note that the figures in column 2
and 3 add to the figures in column 1 as required by the above decomposition.
First, the aggregate productivity column 1 indicates that the aggregate weighted productivity
increased from 1979 to 1986 in 6 out of 8 sectors: food processing, textiles, chemicals, glass, basic

26

metals and machinery and equipment; and declined in the wood and paper industry. The aggregate
productivity gains over the span of seven years range between 7.6% in the manufacturing of machinery
and equipment to around 18% in food, textiles and basic metals, to 33% in glass and 43% in chemicals.
Second, as column 2 shows, the growth in aggregate productivity was driven by a substantial growth in
unweighted productivity only in food manufacturing and textiles. The unweighted productivity actually
declined in wood, paper, and chemical industry. This suggests that most of the improvements in
aggregate productivity resulted from the reallocation of the resources and market share from the less to
more productive plants over time. Column 3 reports the growth stemming from this process. The figures
suggest that, over time, the more productive plants are producing an increasing share of output in six out
of eight industries. In many industries such as paper and basic metals, where the covariance grew by
19.5%, to glass (31%) and chemicals (48.8%), this component of aggregate productivity actually
counteracts the declining trend or unchanging unweighted mean productivity.
The above evidence indicates that the productivity of plants in Chile has changed after trade
liberalization. The bottom section of Table 7 reports the growth for the manufacturing as a whole and for
the sectors of various trade orientations. Aggregate productivity has increased by 19% over seven years:
6.6% due to increased productivity within plants, and 12.7% due to the reallocation of resources from the
less to more efficient producers. The table furthermore suggests that aggregate productivity, unweighted
productivity and covariance between output and productivity grew the most in the import-competing
sectors, and the least in the nontraded goods sectors. To further investigate and identify the effects of
trade liberalization on plant level productivity, I now proceed with the analysis of productivity evolution
in a regression framework.
5.3 Estimation of Variation in Plant-Level Productivity
Although the above evidence suggests that plants belonging to sectors of different trade
orientation reacted differently after a trade liberalization episode, I have not formally identified the

27

influence of trade policy on the evolution of a plant’s productivity. In order to address this question I
utilize the following regression framework:
(12)

prit = α 0 + α1 (Time)it + α 2 (Trade)it + α 3 (Trade * Time)it + α 4 Zit + ν it

where prit is the unweighted productivity measure for a plant i at time t, Time is a vector of year dummy
variables, Trade is a vector of dummy variables indicating trade orientation of a plant (export-oriented,
import-competing), Trade*Time is a vector of interactions of a trade orientation of a plant and a year (for
example, import-competing*year84), and Zit is a vector of plant characteristics such as industry
affiliation and whether it ceases to produce in a given year. The omitted macroeconomic variables are
captured by the year indicators. The nontraded-goods sector, the surviving plants, and year 1979 are the
excluded categories.
This difference in difference framework enables me to separate the variation in productivity due
to changes in Chilean trade regime from the variation emanating from other sources by exploiting not
only the productivity variation over time, but also across plants of different trade orientation. Previous
studies have based the identification of trade policy effects on the comparison of a plant’s behavior
before and after a trade policy shift. This approach might attribute the variation in productivity
originating from some other shocks occurring concurrently with trade policy change such as the 19821983 macroeconomic recession, to the trade policy reform. Furthermore, this intertemporal identification
presumes that plants instantaneously react to the implementation of a trade policy change. Yet, I do not
observe plants’ expectations about the nature and sustainability of the trade policy change. They might
have responded to the changes in trade regime only after they were convinced of the government’s lasting
commitment to a liberalized trade regime. Hence, the effects of trade liberalization are likely to persist
during the early 1980s, a period that is included in my data.
I therefore also utilize the productivity variation across plants belonging to sectors of different
trade orientation. Trade liberalization directly affects plants in the import-competing and export-oriented
sectors, but not the plants in the nontraded-goods sector. On the other hand, I expect other environment

28

changes, for example, the 1982-1983 recession, that occurred while plants were adjusting to the shifts in
trade regime, to impact all sectors.17 My difference in difference estimates of the effects of trade policy
are represented by the coefficient vector α3 from equation (12), whose components are the interactions
between the indicator of the trade orientation of a plant (export-oriented, import-competing) and the year
dummies. The coefficients indicate the productivity differential for traded goods compared to the
nontraded-goods sector that can be directly attributed to liberalized trade flows. By including a separate
term for each year in my sample, I allow the effects of trade liberalization on productivity to vary across
different years. Since I distinguish between the traded-goods and the nontraded-goods sectors, I could
also include a measure of the real exchange rate in my specification of equation (12). However, the
exchange rate only exhibits variation across years. The real exchange rate therefore does not affect my
estimates of the coefficient vector α3 once year indicators are included in my regression, unless it impacts
traded and nontraded-goods sectors differentially. I consider this possibility when I check the robustness
of my results.
I am trying to test whether trade liberalization makes plants more productive. If trade
liberalization improves plants’ productivity in the traded-goods sector, the coefficients in α3 should be
positive. Let us first focus on the implications for the plants in the import-competing sectors. If trade
liberalization lowers the domestic prices of import-competing goods, the domestic plants need to become
more efficient and trim their fat in order to survive. These are within plant productivity improvements
that I can identify with α3. Liquidation of less efficient plants presents an additional channel of
eliminating inefficiencies. I can directly test the incidence of industry rationalization by inclusion of an
indicator for the exiting plants. If plants ceasing to produce are less efficient, the coefficient on the exit
dummy should be negative.

17

Here I need to assume that trade policy does not interact with recession. In other words, I assume that the
international recession does not interact with domestic sectors differently.

29

Unfortunately, it is harder to pinpoint the impact of trade liberalization on productivity of plants
stemming from facilitated access to foreign technology and intermediate inputs. This potential channel
of productivity improvements affects the plants producing traded and nontraded goods. The presence of
within plant productivity improvements in a given industry in general might provide a weak support for
this mechanism, as opposed to the elimination of the X-inefficiencies that impacts only the plants in the
import-competing markets.
Trade theory does not offer much guidelines about the way exporting plants react to trade
liberalization. One possibility would be that only the best plants could export in the past because of the
anti-export bias in the import substituting regimes. Once that bias is eliminated, the exporters need to be
less productive to compete in the world market, which implies a reduction in productivity of the exportoriented sectors. On the other hand, we might not observe much change in their behavior over time.
Several recent studies have found that the exporting plants are in general more productive than the plants
catering solely to domestic market (Aw et. al (1997), Clarides et. al (1996), Bernard and Jensen (1995)),
Clarides et. al (1996)), but none of these studies investigates whether trade liberalization makes exporters
more productive relative to other plants.18
In my estimation, I pool productivity indices for plants in different industries while including the
industry indicators in the regression. Inclusion of the industry indicators controls for the variation of
productivity between industries, so the regressors such as the interaction between trade orientation of a
plant and a year indicator are picking up the effects of within industry variation.19 In addition to
accounting for different means of productivities across industries, I also consider a possibility that
observations are not identically distributed and might have different variance, which is just a problem of

18

These studies actually observe whether a particular plant exports. Chilean data does not provide such detailed
information.
19
Note that the subtraction of the reference plant discussed in section 5.2 is not necessary for my regression analysis
with industry indicators. If I include industry indicators, the reference plant gets absorbed in the means for
individual industries. This only changes the coefficients on the constant and industry indicators in the reported
regression, but does not affect the coefficients on the year and trade orientation interactions.

30

heteroskedasticity. I account for it by the Huber-White variance correction. Finally, I also use the fixed
effects estimation that is based solely on the variation of productivity within a plant.
The regression results are presented in tables 8 and 8a. Appendix table 1 and 1a repeat the
analysis in table 8 and 8a using the measure of productivity computed from the production function
estimates based on the plants with positive investment (reported in table 6a, column 2).20 The estimates
of the relationship between trade and productivity do not change when I use the measure of productivity
constructed from the production function estimates based solely on the observations with strictly positive
investment. Moreover, the reported results in table 8 and 8a are robust to experimenting with different
specifications. Because of the robustness of results across various specifications, let us now focus mostly
on the results obtained in the OLS regressions.
First, the coefficients on the exit indicator in column 3 of Table 8a suggest that the exiting plants
are on average 8.1% less productive than the surviving plants.21 My findings support the idea that the
high levels of trade protection in Chile during the 1970s enabled the coexistence of producers with
different levels of productivity, while some of those failed to survive in a more competitive setting during
the early 1980s. As protection ceased, the less efficient producers exited. I presumed that this kind of
behavior would be the most pronounced in the import-competing sector, which was sheltered from
foreign competition before the trade liberalization. As the relative prices of imports decline, I would
expect the most inefficient plants in the import-competing industry to exit. To check this hypothesis I
interact the exit indicator variable with an indicator for the trade orientation of the plant. As column 4 of
Table 8a indicates, I find no evidence that the exiting plants from the import-competing sector are any
less productive than the exiting plants from the export-oriented or the nontraded goods sector. The
coefficients on the interaction between exit and importables (-.007) and between exit and exportables

20

In addition, appendix tables 2 and 2a repeat the analysis in appendix tables 1 and 1a using only plant observations
with strictly positive investment. The main findings do not change.
21
The fixed effects coefficient in column 1 suggests that the exiting firms are on average only 1.9% less productive
than the surviving plants, but since it is based on the variation within a plant it excludes the firms that never ceased to
produce between 1979 to 1986. These firms are on average more productive, so the lower estimate is not surprising.

31

(-.021) are not significantly different from zero. So, although the exit of less efficient plants contributes
to productivity improvements, the exit effects do not vary across plants of different trade orientation.
Second, the positive signs of the coefficients on the interaction between the import-competing
sector and year dummy variables in column 3 in Table 8 and 8a indicate that plants in the importcompeting sectors are on average becoming more productive in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986
relative to the plants in the nontraded goods sector in the corresponding years. Moreover, this difference
in productivity increases with time; this suggests that liberalized trade flows positively influence the
productivity of plants in the import-competing sector. The productivity gains attributable to trade policy
liberalization range from 3% in 1982 to 10.4% in 1985. As other columns of Tables 8 and 8a indicate,
this finding is robust to all specifications of equation (12), and to the inclusion of an exit indicator. This
growth in productivity could result from the liquidation of the inefficient plants, which could increase the
average productivity in the import competing sectors without any within plant improvements. This,
however, is not the case. The results reported in Table 8a control for plant exit and show that the exit of
plants only partially explains productivity improvements. The comparison of the coefficients in column
3 in Tables 8 and 8a reveals that the inclusion of the exit indicator in the regression hardly changes the
coefficients on the interaction of a plant’s import-competing status and year indicators. This suggests
that the continuing plants in the import-competing sectors improved their productivity, as they adjusted
to a more liberalized trading environment. Possible mechanisms are elimination of the X-inefficiencies
or some other agency problem, or adoption of better technology from abroad.
The evidence for producers of exportable products is less robust and suggests slower productivity
improvements resulting from trade liberalization.22 Column 3 of Table 8 shows that although plants in
the export-oriented sectors are in general 11% more productive than the producers of the nontraded
goods, this productivity difference diminishes at the beginning of the sample in 1980 and 1981. The

22

The F-tests indicate that the coefficients on the trade orientation-year interactions are statistically different for the
firms in the import-competing and the export-oriented sectors in all years, except for 1984 for all of our
specifications of equation (12).

32

coefficient on the interaction of year and export-orientation becomes either positive or not significantly
different from zero in 1982 and onwards. This result is robust to various specifications of equation (12)
reported in Tables 8 and 8a. This finding is interesting as well. In an import-substituting regime such as
in Chile, the exporters face many discriminatory policies, so probably only the most productive plants
export. As trade liberalization diminishes the anti-export bias, the less productive plants can flourish on
the export market as well, a finding that would explain the declining productivity of plants in the
exporting sectors of the economy from 1980 to 1981. On the other hand, the lack of significant changes
in the productivity of exporters could imply that the exporters already needed to be very productive to
compete successfully on foreign markets, so that trade liberalization did not represent such a large
productivity shock to them as to the plants in the import-competing sectors of the economy. Aw et. al
(1997) find that the exporting plants in Taiwan are more productive than nonexporters because they need
to face extra transportation costs and tougher market conditions to survive, but not that exporters become
more productive through their exporting activity.
The analysis above relies on the identification of trade policy effects by comparing the response
of plants in traded goods sectors to plants in nontraded goods sectors, since only the first group could be
affected by the increased foreign competition. There are two other variables that could potentially
impact my interpretation: the real exchange rate and the temporary increase in tariffs in 1983 and 1984.
The Chilean real exchange rate appreciated until 1981 and then depreciated in 1982 due to a nominal
exchange rate depreciation.23 The real exchange rate might affect nontraded and traded sectors
differently if it affects the measured productivity through changes in the composition of demand for
nontradables and tradables. In particular, a real exchange rate appreciation (an increase in the exchange
rate by IMF definition) might increase the demand for nontradables and decrease the demand for
domestically produced import-competing goods. For example, in the case of appreciation, if plants do
not adjust their inputs instantaneously and plants have some spare capacity these demand fluctuations

33

could lead to an increase in measured productivity for the plants in the nontraded goods sector and a
decrease in measured productivity for the domestic plants in the import-competing sectors. Real
exchange rate depreciation would do the opposite.
Below I present several independent pieces of evidence that raise doubts that such real exchange
rate effects are driving my results. First, I observe persistent productivity improvement in the importcompeting sector over relatively long periods of time. These firms would then need to improve their
productivity based on spare capacity over six plus years, which is very unlikely. Second, the above
exchange rate mechanism suggests that productivity growth (decline) comes from expansions
(contractions) in output without changes in inputs due to spare capacity. If that is the case, plant
productivity growth should be strongly positively correlated with the output growth. Simple correlation
coefficients reported in table 9a suggest that the correlation between plant output growth and productivity
growth is very small (ranging from .086 to .224 in various industries). The lack of strong correlation
suggests that the measured productivity improvements could not be explained solely by the mechanism
through demand real exchange shocks. Third, if measured productivity changes occur through firms
eliminating (increasing) excess capacity due to demand booms (slowdowns), inventories are also likely to
fluctuate significantly. Firms facing demand booms are likely to reduce their inventories and vice versa.
I compare average inventories of plants of various trade orientations during times of the real exchange
rate appreciation and depreciations in table 9b. The level of inventories (and the share of inventories in
total output) does not fluctuate much and the fluctuations do not seem to correspond to the timing of the
real exchange rate fluctuations.
Finally, if Chilean plants have spare capacity and measured productivity reflects demand
changes, the correlation between measured productivity and the real exchange rate should be positive for
the plants in the nontraded-goods sectors and negative for the plants in the traded goods sectors (since an
increase in exchange rate means appreciation by IMF definition). To check this hypothesis I regress my
23

The real exchange rate is measured by the real effective exchange rate reported in the IMF’s International financial

34

measure of productivity on the real exchange rate, indicators for trade orientations, a time trend, and the
interaction of the time trend with trade orientation. The plants in the nontraded-goods sectors are the
excluded category. Results are reported in table 9c and do not support the demand fluctuation story. The
real exchange rate is positively correlated with measured productivity of the plants in the nontradedgoods sector (omitted category) and import-competing sectors. Moreover, the real exchange rate does
not impact the measured productivity in the two sectors differently. The coefficient on the interaction of
the real exchange rate and the import indicator is statistically insignificant. The correlation between
measured productivity and the real exchange rate is insignificant for plants in the export-oriented sectors.
Real exchange rate appreciation effectively implies less protection for the domestic sector, while
exchange rate depreciation implies more protection. Exchange rate movements could therefore also have
productivity effects similar to fluctuations in foreign competition. As the exchange rate increases
(appreciates) the plants in the import competing sectors would need to become more productive in order
to survive. The positive correlation between productivity in the import-competing sector and the
exchange rate in table 9c supports this story.
A second concern with the interpretation of my results regards the timing of my sample and the
impact of a temporary increase in tariffs in 1983 and 1984. Since tariffs increased by the same degree for
all manufacturing sectors and I use the Census of Manufacturers’, year indicators in the estimation of
equation (12) in the paper capture their impact on productivity, and I therefore do not include them in my
initial regressions. When I do regress tariff levels on plant productivity, the results reported in column 1
and 2 of table 9d indicate that plant productivity is negatively correlated with tariff levels, providing
support for my previous results.24
So far I have measured the trade orientation of a plant by an indicator variable. It is very difficult
to measure the impact of foreign competition and trade liberalization with one variable. In order to

statistics yearbook.
24
I cannot control for year indicators and tariff levels at the same time because tariffs only vary by year, and they do
not vary at all before 1983.

35

obtain a more direct relationship between foreign competition facing plants in various industries and
plant productivity, I also measure foreign competition with imports as a share of domestic output on a
four-digit ISIC level. When I regress productivity on this new measure of foreign competition I find that
plants in industries that face a higher share of imports are more productive: the coefficient on the import
to output ratio is positive (column 3 of table 9d). The positive correlation persists when I control for the
tariff and the real exchange rate (column 4). Appendix tables 3a, 3b, and 3c repeat the above analysis
using the productivity measure based on production function coefficient obtained using only plants with
positive investment. They yield the same findings and similar coefficient estimates.
Overall, the above analysis suggests that the exclusion of the real exchange rate from my initial
analysis is unlikely to affect the robustness of my results, because the exchange rate does affect plants in
the import-competing sectors differently than it affects plants in the nontraded goods sectors. The
additional findings based on the use of tariffs and import shares as measures of foreign competition show
that my initial result, i.e. that increased foreign pressure (trade liberalization) yields productivity
improvements, is robust to various measures of foreign competition.
6. Summary and Conclusion
This paper studies the effects of trade liberalization on the evolution of plant productivity. In my
analysis I pay particular attention to the methodological hurdles that have haunted the previous empirical
studies: construction of a productivity measure that is based on consistent estimates of the production
function coefficients, the identification of trade policy effects, and the role of plant exit and the transfer
of resources from less to more efficient producers within industries.
These methodological aspects turn out to be important. The coefficient on capital is on average
about double the OLS estimate after adjusting for self selection induced by plant closings, and declines
on average by 22% in sectors with strong simultaneity bias. This finding reconfirms Olley and Pakes's
(1996) finding that one cannot ignore selection and simultaneity issues in the estimation of a production

36

function, and that semiparametric estimation of a production function provides a useful alternative to the
methods used in previous studies.
I then analyze the effects of trade policy on plant productivity in a regression framework. I
identify the impact of trade liberalization on productivity by using both the variation of productivity over
time and the variation across traded and nontraded goods sectors. This framework allows me to separate
productivity variation resulting from trade policy from productivity variation stemming from other
sources. My results suggest that trade liberalization enhances plant productivity. In particular, using
unweighted productivity I show that the productivity of the producers of the import-competing goods
improved on average 3 to 10% more than the productivity of plants in the nontraded-goods sectors due to
a policy change. This finding suggests that the plants responded to intensified foreign competition by
trimming their fat. The evidence for the plants in the export-oriented sectors of the economy is less
robust and conclusive. The result that foreign competition affects productivity positively is also
confirmed when I measure foreign competition with import to output ratios in various industries, tariffs,
and exchange rate.
Third, exit in general contributes to productivity gains: exiting plants are on average about 8%
less productive than surviving plants. Aggregate industry-level productivity indices in addition suggest
that the reshuffling of resources in general from less to more productive producers contributes to
aggregate productivity gains, especially for the plants in the export-oriented and import-competing
sectors. The aggregate productivity grew by 25.4% and 31.9% in the export-oriented and importcompeting sectors over seven years, respectively, whereas the gains in the nontraded goods sectors
amounted to 6%. I find that in general, the Chilean manufacturing sector grew at an average annual rate
of 2.8% after trade liberalization, mostly due to the reshuffling of the resources within the economy
(about 2%).
Although it is hard to pinpoint the exact mechanism behind these productivity improvements, the
within industry heterogeneity of plants and the reallocation of market share towards more productive

37

plants seem to play a role in addition to the plants in the import-competing sectors trimming their fat. In
terms of policy implications, my finding suggests that the barriers to plant turnover are important
determinants of the success of trade liberalization. As such, the study complements the recent empirical
work by Aw et. al. (1997) analyzing the importance of plant turnover in Taiwan, where sunk cost do not
present a large barrier. My results also substantiate concerns raised in popular press regarding recent
economic turmoil in East Asia. When exit of plants and the reallocation of resources within industries
play an important role in the economic growth, the institutional arrangements that obstruct plant
liquidation as in Japan, or the confinement of such process to smaller businesses as in South Korea
(NYT, Sept. 8, 1998) can prove very harmful.
Finally, my findings suggest that incorporation of within industry plant heterogeneity in the
analysis of trade liberalization seems to be a fruitful area for the future theoretical work in trade
literature.

between missing observations (due to missing variables) and exit. **These
numbers reflect the actual plant exit. The definiton of exit in this paper is based
on the second set of numbers.

Note: This table continues on the next page. Under full sample, the number of observations is lower in the series than in the OLS column because
the series estimation requires lagged variables. I have also estimated OLS and fixed effects regressions excluding these observations. The
coefficients do not change. All standard errors in column 5 are bootstraped using 1,000 replications.

Note: ** and * indicate significance at a 5% and 10% level, respectively.
Standard errors are corrected for heteroskedasticity and repeated
observations on the same plant. The regression also includes a time trend,
export indicator, import indicator, and interactions of the time trend with
export and import indicators as regressors. The nontraded goods plants are
the excluded category. The reported p values are for the F-test of the
hypothesis that the total effect of real exchange rate on productivity of
export oriented plants is zero (similarly for imports).

The correlation coefficients report the correlation between plant productivity growth
and plant output growth in a respective industry. Productivity growth is based on the
production function coefficients obtained by using the observations with positive
investment (column 2, table 6a).

Note: ** and * indicate significance at a 5% and 10% level, respectively. Standard
errors are corrected for heteroskedasticity and repeated observations on the same
plant. The regression also includes a time trend, export indicator, import indicator,
and interactions of time trend with export and import indicators as regressors. The
nontraded goods plants are the excluded category. The reported p values are for the Ftest of the hypothesis that the total effect of real exchange rate on productivity of
export oriented plants is zero (similarly for imports). Productivity measure is based
on the production function coefficients obtained by using the observations with
positive investment (column 2, table 6a).
