Introduction

The Internet is expanding rapidly into every market and many geographic locations. While
much attention focuses on so-called ‚Äúnew economy‚Äù businesses, an interesting aspect of the
Internet revolution is the change being forced on traditional industries. The resulting threat
to intermediaries such as traditional brokerage and music labels were not hard to predict,
however, the impact of the Internet on some other industries was less clear. In 1995, for
example, the popular press devoted much discussion to predicting the products for which the
Internet would be a good sales channel. Cars were often considered to be a poor Ô¨Åt. After
all, went the argument, consumers would always want to ‚Äúkick the tires‚Äù before buying a car.
While consumers remain interested in physically inspecting a car, the Internet has nonetheless
become an important complement to the car-buying process. In 1999, for example, 25% of all
consumers who were in the market for a new car used the Internet in conjunction with buying
a car (J.D. Power and Associates, 1999).
This paper investigates web-based auto retailing to understand whether the Internet has
changed the product market behavior of established Ô¨Årms. In particular we investigate how
much and in what ways Internet car referral services aÔ¨Äect dealer pricing of automobiles in
California.
Internet car referral services are one of three types of sites related to new car purchases;
the other two types are informational sites and sites that oÔ¨Äer cars at posted prices. At the
core of both informational and referral sites is detailed information about individual cars,
including current market conditions and invoice pricing. While informational sites are only
indirectly involved in the car purchase, referral sites such as Autobytel.com, Autoweb.com,
and Carpoint.com establish contractual relations with dealers and pass on consumers‚Äô purchase
requests or ‚ÄúqualiÔ¨Åed leads‚Äù to contract dealers. Recently, sites have started operating that
oÔ¨Äer cars at posted prices (although the actual sale is still performed through an aÔ¨Éliated
dealership). These services are still in their infancy.
In this paper we capitalize on the fact that Internet purchase referral services do not control
the prices oÔ¨Äered by the dealer. This means that prices that are oÔ¨Äered to consumers continue
to be the choice variable of dealers, whether a consumer walked into the showroom or was
referred by an Internet service. The referring Internet services do not systematically learn
transaction prices. To date it has not been possible, except through self-reported surveys, to
assess what impact Internet referral services have on prices. The Ô¨Årst question we answer in
this paper is whether consumers who use Internet purchase referral services to buy a car pay
less for an equivalent car than consumers who do not. Analyzing purchase referral data from
Autobytel.com in combination with transaction data from J.D. Powers and Associates (JDPA),

2

the answer is yes. Conditional on the car, consumers that submitted a purchase request pay
on average $451 less than an oÔ¨Ñine customer. Of these savings $72 stem from the fact that
Autobytel.com steers consumers to low-price dealerships. Conditioning on the dealership (in
addition to the car), online consumers pay another $379 less than oÔ¨Ñine customer. We also Ô¨Ånd
that the level of price dispersion at a dealer declines in the dealer‚Äôs Autobytel.com business.
This indicates that the lower prices we Ô¨Ånd are not entirely driven by the selection eÔ¨Äect (good
bargainers move online). The combination of results and the fact that referral services save
consumers time seem to validate Autobytel.com‚Äôs value proposition to consumers (and perhaps
that of other referral services) and may explain why referral service usage has grown rapidly.
Secondly, we examine the level of dealer proÔ¨Åts from the vehicle and from other products
and services sold using the web. Dealer margins (price less invoice cost) on the sale of a
vehicle through Autobytel.com are signiÔ¨Åcantly lower than margins earned selling the vehicle
the traditional way; prices are lower and the costs of acquiring the vehicle from manufacturers
are not. In addition, proÔ¨Åts from ancillary products like Ô¨Ånancing and service contracts are
also lower (by about $160) when the customer arrives via the web. Because online customers
are substantially cheaper to serve, however, the dealer is likely to be better oÔ¨Ä working with
Autobytel.com.1 To our knowledge this is the Ô¨Årst study of the eÔ¨Äect of Internet purchase
referral services on car pricing using transaction data. This paper contributes to a small body
of empirical literature analyzing the eÔ¨Äect of the Internet on Ô¨Årms‚Äô product market behavior
(Brown & Goolsbee, 2000; Brynjolfsson & Smith, 1999; Carlton & Chevalier, 2000; Clay,
Krishnan, & WolÔ¨Ä, 2000; Clemons, Hann, & Hitt, 1999; Lucking-Reiley, 1999; Iyer & Pazgal,
2000). There are a number of papers that analyze automobile pricing (Ayres & Siegelman,
1995; Berry, Levinsohn, & Pakes, 1995; Goldberg, 1995, 1996; Pashigian, Bowen, & Gould,
1995; Verboven, 1999). Goldberg (1995) and Berry et al. (1995) estimate structural models
of demand for automobiles. Pashigian et al. (1995) investigates within-season pricing patterns
for automobiles, and Verboven (1999) tries to determine whether pricing practices on base
cars diÔ¨Äer from those of cars with options. Ayres and Siegelman (1995) and Goldberg (1996)
analyze race and gender discrimination by car dealers. Our paper is closest to these in that
we are explicitly interested in the diÔ¨Äerential pricing introduced by dealerships. However, in
contrast to all previous studies, our focus is on the Internet and how it aÔ¨Äects the level and
distribution of auto prices.
We proceed as follows. Section 2 describes Internet car retailing. Section 3 discusses some
of the eÔ¨Äects that the Internet may have on car pricing. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5
presents the results, and section 6 concludes the paper.

Internet car retailing

Informational sites do not have direct relationships with car dealers. Perhaps the best known
example of a for-proÔ¨Åt information site is edmunds.com, providing rich editorial content similar
to a car magazine (review, long term tests, etc.) supplemented with information on exact
options and invoice pricing for new and used vehicles. Sources of revenues are advertising,
detailed reports on vehicles, and commissions to other Internet sites such as the auto-loan site
peopleÔ¨Årst.com, the insurance company geico.com, and referral sites such as Autobytel.com.
There also exist many non-proÔ¨Åt information sites typically run by ‚Äúenthusiasts‚Äù that provide
information about vehicles, options, and dealers. A good example is audiworld.com.
Purchase referral sites were the Ô¨Årst Internet companies to contract directly with car dealers.
They try to capitalize on the large dissatisfaction of consumers with the car buying process
by shielding consumers as much as possible from direct interaction with dealers and ‚Äúarming‚Äù
them with information.2 In light of the regulatory constraints in all US states that give dealers
the exclusive right to sell cars to consumers, Autoweb.com, Autobytel.com, and Carpoint.com
(to name some of the largest sites) focus on referring consumers to car dealers with which they
have contracted.3 Autobytel.com, the Ô¨Årst of these sites, has been in operation since March
of 1995. Referral sites oÔ¨Äer consumers detailed information about individual cars, including
current market conditions and invoice pricing as well as editorial content.
At any given point a consumer may submit a free purchase request in which the consumer
speciÔ¨Åes which car she is interested in (including options and color), within which time frame
she intends to purchase, and where she can be reached. While there are some small diÔ¨Äerences
between referral sites, these purchase requests are generally e-mailed to a salesperson within a
dealership who is assigned exclusively to responding to Internet purchase requests. Consumers
are typically called back or e-mailed within 24-48 hours with a (supposedly) Ô¨Åxed price.4 They
can buy the car, if they wish to do so, without setting foot in the dealership until they pick
up the car. The referral service sends an e-mail to the customer a few days after the referral
asking whether she has been contacted by the dealer. Two weeks later another survey is sent to
consumers, inquiring whether a car has been purchased and whether the consumer was satisÔ¨Åed
with the dealership.
Referral sites send submitted referrals to dealers with whom they have contracted. Out
of the approximately 22000 dealers in the US as of 2000, Carpoint.com, for example, had

3,700 dealers under contract, and Autoweb.com and Autobytel.com each contracted with 5,000
dealerships.5 Dealers either pay an annual Ô¨Åxed fee based on the size of the dealership (between
$500 and $7500 for Autobytel.com) or a combination of annual fee and a per referral charge
($500-$1000 annual fee and $29 per referral for Autoweb).6 In exchange, dealers are assigned
exclusive or semi-exclusive territories such that customers in a speciÔ¨Åed geographic area that
submit a purchase referral for a speciÔ¨Åc car get referred to one dealer only (or two dealers in the
case of semi exclusivity). The contract usually also speciÔ¨Åes that the sales person who responds
to requests by the referral service does not sell to walk-in customers. This dedicated ‚ÄúInternet
sales person‚Äù is usually trained directly by the referral service. In addition, dealerships are
usually required to compensate this sales person by units sold, not as a percentage of car proÔ¨Åt.
These rules are intended to ensure that consumers receive a ‚Äúno-haggle‚Äù price. Dealerships are
encouraged to give referral consumers the lowest Ô¨Ånal price they would normally give a consumer
on the sales Ô¨Çoor. Purchase referral sites cannot monitor dealer performance directly. Instead
they rely on customer satisfaction surveys and on their estimates of ‚Äúconversion rates,‚Äù i.e.
how many referrals are sent to the dealer per sale made. Conversion rates are about 4 leads to
1 sale. If conversion rate numbers are low for a dealership, or many consumers complain about
the dealership, a referral site will terminate the contract with the dealer. Autobytel.com, for
example, terminated over 250 dealers between 1995 and 1999.7
Recently, some Internet sites have started oÔ¨Äering cars at posted prices to consumers. The
most prominent ones are CarsDirect.com and Greenlight.com. CarsDirect is an online broker
that has contracts with 1700 dealerships nationwide. A consumers buys a vehicle at a Ô¨Åxed
price on CarsDirect‚Äôs site but still interacts with the dealer to sign the papers. Greenlight is
founded by the Ashbury automotive group, a large owner of dealerships and and sells consumers
cars owned by its dealerships.

Hypotheses

The Internet can be expected to have a strong eÔ¨Äect on car retailing because many ‚Äî if not
most ‚Äî customers actively dislike contact with car dealerships and particularly salespeople.
This stands in contrast to some other industries such as brokerage, where customers might like,
or at least feel neutral about, their broker. Consequently, online auto referral services advertise
both their convenience and their ability to get low prices for consumers.

Consumers may gain from shopping online even if Internet referral services do not cause
dealers to oÔ¨Äer diÔ¨Äerent prices to online and oÔ¨Ñine consumers. This is because referral services
may simply sign up the lowest-cost/lowest-price dealers in each region. In this way a consumer
gains by using the service because she does not have to search for the cheapest dealership in
her area. In such a world, the Internet is causing mean prices to decline by reducing search
costs.
The contract between the Internet referral service and the dealer contains incentives that
may cause the dealer to oÔ¨Äer referred customers low prices. An Autobytel.com dealer pays a
yearly fee for the stream of leads and may decide whether and how to convert each lead into
a sale. However, the referral service expects a substantial proportion of leads to result in sale,
since this is the best way to keep customers happy.8 If the percentage ‚Äúclosed‚Äù (sales/leads) is
too low, the dealer may be terminated by the Internet referral service and replaced by another
dealer in that area. Provided the stream of customers generated by the Internet referral service
is valuable to the dealership, it has an incentive to quote low prices to keep its ‚Äúclose‚Äù percentage
up. In a sense, the referral service is bargaining on behalf of a group of consumers, although
that group is not yet formed. This bargaining feature of the referral service is one we expect
to lead to lower prices for consumers who use the service.
However, referral services also must attract and partner with dealers, who would not participate if their outside option were better. It may be that dealers participate to gain incremental
sales or to prevent incremental sales by a competing dealer that may otherwise sign up with
the referral service. It is also possible, however, that lower-priced Internet sales may be as profitable as conventional sales, depending on the dealership‚Äôs cost structure. Online buyers are
low cost because they have searched already (test-driving at some other dealership perhaps),
have decided what car they want, and are ready to buy. Therefore the dealer may be able to
spend very little time selling and little time haggling. Any incremental sales (business stealing)
may also create economies of scale for a dealership. Thus, dealers are put in contact with a
large volume of low-cost consumers and expected to oÔ¨Äer price reductions.
There are two arguments why consumers who use referral services may pay more than
other consumers. First, Internet purchase referral services are convenient because they allow a
consumer to engage in the car purchase process any time of day or night without leaving her
home. In addition, referral services shield consumers to some extent from direct interaction
with dealers. To the extent that consumers with a high utility for convenience are less price
sensitive, we should expect that dealers charge referral customers a higher price ‚Äî not lower
prices as claimed by Internet referral services. Second, the Internet may attract those consumers
8

This determination is made on the basis of customer satisfaction surveys.

who are bad bargainers because it allows them to avoid face-to-face negotiations. We would
expect dealers to recognize this in the long run and thus price higher for referred customers.
Overall, however, we expect bargaining on behalf of consumers and the lower cost of selling to
outweigh the potential eÔ¨Äect of convenience and negotiation avoidance.
Therefore, we hypothesize the following:
‚Ä¢ Dealerships that contract with an Internet referral service have lower oÔ¨Ñine prices than
other dealerships.
‚Ä¢ Consumers who submit a purchase request pay a lower price than other consumers at
that dealership.
The referred customers may also face lower search cost in obtaining detailed information
about current market conditions and invoice pricing from the referral site and other web sites.
They may therefore be well informed about what the price of their preferred car ought to
be. Dealers will have a harder time selling to this group with an unreasonably high price.
If these consumers were previously uninformed (and perhaps paying an unreasonably high
price), we expect to see the high end of the distribution of prices moving toward the mean as
Autobytel.com sales rise.
It is important to note that it is possible that the referral site has no eÔ¨Äect on the price
a particular consumer receives, despite average on-line prices being lower than average oÔ¨Äline prices. Suppose that all the educated people received low prices before the Internet was
invented because they read Consumer Reports and were good at bargaining. Now all the
educated consumers use the Internet to obtain price information and to conduct bargaining
over the purchase. The same customers continue to get lower prices than average, but because
they disproportionately use the Internet, Internet prices are lower than average. In this case
Autobytel.com prices will be lower than average, but the cause of the lower prices would
be unclear. If this story were true, the distribution of prices would remain unchanged with
the introduction of the Internet. Our conjecture above, that the Internet informs previously
uninformed customers, implies that price dispersion will decline with Internet use if these
consumers move from the far right of the price distribution toward the mean.
‚Ä¢ The dispersion of prices within a dealership will decline with the amount of Internet
(informed) customers.
In addition, we also explore how the price a consumer pays varies if that consumer uses the
Internet referral service but then purchases from another dealer, as compared to purchasing
from the dealer to whom she was referred. Normally, we would expect a consumer to abandon
7

one product choice in favor of another because it featured a lower price or higher quality. The
same holds in this market. Consumers may search further with their Internet referral quote
to extract more price concessions from other dealers. In this case, consumers who leave their
referred dealer should pay a lower price than those who stay. However, a consumers may also
leave the referred dealer because the competing dealer oÔ¨Äers better quality: for example, a
location near the customer‚Äôs home or work. For these customers we should see transaction
prices that are the same or higher in comparison with the prices of those who did not leave the
referred dealer.
‚Ä¢ If consumers who submit a purchase request and switch away from their referred dealer
do so to obtain higher quality (lower prices), transaction prices of these consumers will
be higher (lower) than those of consumers who purchase from the referred dealer.
This hypothesis also speaks to the convenience aspect of referral services. We do not expect
this hypothesis to hold if many consumers use Internet referral services for convenience and
dealerships price accordingly. Then, those consumers that are willing to spend time searching
for a low price should Ô¨Ånd a better price by switching to a dealership other than the one to
whom they were referred.

Data

Our data come from two sources. The Ô¨Årst is a major online car referral service, Autobytel.com.9
We have obtained the purchase requests submitted by consumers on Autobytel.com during 1999,
yielding slightly over 2 million observations. An observation consists of customer information,
desired car, the date the request was made, the dealer to whom Autobytel.com sent the referral,
and the time frame within which the consumer is interested in buying the vehicle.
The second dataset we employ comes from J.D. Power and Associates (JDPA). JDPA
collects transaction data from a sample of dealers in the major metropolitan areas in the US.
We have data from California dealerships, containing every new car transaction at a sample of
1101 dealerships from January 1, 1999 to February 28, 2000. We take the extra two months
of JDPA data to allow for referrals in late 1999 that result in a purchase in early 2000. Each
observation in the JDPA data contains customer information, the make, model and trim level
9

Autobytel.com had between 45 and 50% market share of online car shopping in 1999 (LA Times, 3/28/2000,
‚ÄúMergers and Acquisitions Report,‚Äù Securities Data Publishing 6/12/2000). According to February 2000 survey
by GreenÔ¨Åeld Online, Autobytel.com is the most visited Automobile site to research for a new car. It is visited
by 25% of consumers that researched online to shop for a car, followed by ford.com (24%), gm.com (16%),
toyota.com (14%), autoweb.com (12%), honda.com (12%), autovantage.com (12%), chryslercorp.com (11%),

of the car, Ô¨Ånancing, trade-in information, dealer-added extras, and the proÔ¨Åtability of the car
and the customer to the dealership.10
We consider a match between observations from Autobytel.com and JDPA when both the
address and the name associated with the referral and the purchase transaction are identical.
Thus, our matching is conservative. For example, if the purchase referral was submitted by a
family member with a diÔ¨Äerent name from the person who purchased the car, we would not
consider the observations to match, even if they live at the same address. Each observation in
the new dataset is a transaction from the JDPA data, augmented with the information from the
Autobytel.com data if there was a match. Hence, customers who get an Autobytel.com referral
but subsequently do not purchase will not be in the combined dataset. We are not interested in
these customers as there is no observable transaction. If the customer purchases a car, but not
from a dealership in the JDPA sample, she will not be in our dataset either. This information
is lost, but as we have no prices from Autobytel.com and no comparison data from JDPA, there
is no analysis that can be done with this group. Finally, there are online referral services other
than Autobytel.com. The customers in the combined dataset who are not identiÔ¨Åed as using
Autobytel.com may have used one of their competitors. This strengthens our test since we will
be comparing a group that used Autobytel.com to a group that may include users of competing
services.
The combined dataset contains 360255 vehicle purchases between January 1, 1999 and
February 28, 2000. There are 10288 customers in this dataset who submitted a purchase request
in 1999 through Autobytel.com (2.9% of all transactions). The new variables created after the
match between datasets are (1) an indicator for Autobytel.com customer (ABT ) indicating
that the customer who purchased the car submitted a purchase request using Autobytel.com
(irrespective of whether this purchase request went to the dealer that sold the car), (2) an
indicator for Autobytel.com franchise dealer (ABTFranchise) indicating that the dealer who
sold the car is an Autobytel.com aÔ¨Éliated dealer, i.e. is under contract with Autobytel.com and
receives purchase requests, (3) an indicator for same dealer (SameDealer ) marking cases when
the dealer that sold the car is the same dealer to whom the purchase request was submitted
(given that ABT=1).

Car deÔ¨Ånition and selection

Since consumers who use Autobytel.com may prefer diÔ¨Äerent cars than those who do not,
it is very important to control for the exact car that was purchased. We deÔ¨Åne a ‚Äúcar‚Äù as

every combination of make and model (e.g. Honda Accord, Toyota Camry), body type (e.g.
convertible, coupe, hatchback, sport utility), doors (e.g. 2 door, 4 door, 4D Ext Cab), trim level
(for Honda Accord, e.g. DX, EX, LX etc.), drive train type (e.g. 2WD, 4WD), transmission type
(automatic, manual), cylinders (e.g. 4 Cyl, 6 Cyl), displacement (e.g. 3.0 liters, 3.3 liters),
and model year (e.g. 1999, 2000).11 This results in many diÔ¨Äerent ‚Äúcars,‚Äù some of which
comprise very few observations. We drop cars for which there are fewer than 500 observations,
unless that car has has more than 1.5% share of its segment (as deÔ¨Åned by JDPA). In addition,
because there are so few units sold, we drop the ‚ÄúLarge‚Äù segment.
Although we have a great deal of information about the car purchased, we do not know
what options have been purchased unless they are represented by the trim level. While the
trim level captures most options, we do not observe exact dealer and factory-installed options
(a CD player for example). The prices we observe, however, will reÔ¨Çect all options. We believe
that the bias generated by this omitted variable will make our test stronger. People using the
Internet are on average more educated and more aÔ¨Ñuent than those not using the Internet.
Therefore, we would expect them to purchase unobservably fancier cars than the average buyer.
If this eÔ¨Äect is strong, we will Ô¨Ånd a ‚Äúbuying online‚Äù indicator predicts higher prices, not lower
ones.
Removing ‚Äúcars‚Äù with a small number of observations reduces the sample size by 46% to
195772. The dataset now contains 204 diÔ¨Äerent ‚Äúcars‚Äù sold through 810 dealers.

4.2

Dependent variables

There are many diÔ¨Äerent ways of deÔ¨Åning the price of a vehicle, for example one can take into
account the proÔ¨Åt/loss from a trade-in, dealer installed accessories, or manufacturer rebates.
11

46.5% of the cars in the full dataset have a transmission coded as ‚ÄòN/A‚Äô rather than automatic or manual.
Most cars have observations in all three groups or in just automatic and N/A. We treat the N/A group as
another type of transmission, since it is likely to be composed of both automatic and standard shift cars, but
we cannot tell in what mix.

10

For our main speciÔ¨Åcation we deÔ¨Åne Price as the price that the customer pays for the vehicle,
factory installed accessories and options, and dealer-installed accessories contracted for at the
time of sale, subject to two adjustments. First, we subtract the ManufacturerRebate given
given directly to the consumer, if any, since this is simply cash that reduces the price of the car
to the customer. Secondly, we subtract what is known as the TradeInOverAllowance. This is
the diÔ¨Äerence between the trade-in price paid by the dealer to the consumer and the estimated
cash value of the trade-in vehicle (as booked by the dealer). This is the negative of the dealer‚Äôs
projected proÔ¨Åt on the trade-in vehicle. We adjust for this amount to account for the fact that
dealers may oÔ¨Äer consumers, for example, a low price for the new car because they are making
a proÔ¨Åt oÔ¨Ä the trade-in. Table 4.2 shows an example where consumers A and B are contracting
with the dealer for a diÔ¨Äerent new car price but end up paying the same Price according to
our deÔ¨Ånition.

All factory and dealer accessories that contribute to the resale value of the car are contained
in Price; so called ‚Äúafter market options (AMOs)‚Äù such as rustprooÔ¨Ång or wax are not included,
nor are service contracts and other sources of income for the dealer.
The VehicleCost is the retailer‚Äôs ‚Äònet‚Äô cost for the vehicle and includes the cost of accessories
added by the factory and/or retailer and included in the customer‚Äôs contract that add to the
vehicle‚Äôs book value. The measure takes into account holdback and includes transportation
charges.12
We deÔ¨Åne VehicleProÔ¨Åt as the dollar proÔ¨Åt that the dealer makes on the vehicle, factory
installed accessories and options, and dealer-installed accessories contracted for at the time of
sale. Hence, VehicleProÔ¨Åt = Price ‚àí VehicleCost + ManufacturerRebate. We add manufacturer
rebate since it goes directly from the manufacturer to the consumer. We also use TotalProÔ¨Åt
which adds proÔ¨Åts from Ô¨Ånancing, service contracts, and credit insurance.
12
‚ÄúHoldback‚Äù is the trade‚Äôs term for additional proÔ¨Åt to the dealer built in to the invoice for the car, but not
itemized as such on the invoice. If a dealer sells a car at his invoice price, his proÔ¨Åt on the car will equal the
holdback amount on the car.

11

4.3

Controls

To control for time variation in prices we deÔ¨Åne a dummy EndOfMonth that equals 1 if the
car was sold within the last 5 days of the month. Dealers who want to meet volume targets
for the month often have sales or other inducements to purchase near the end of the month. A
dummy variable Weekend speciÔ¨Åes whether the car was purchased on a Saturday or Sunday for
the same reason. In addition, we introduce dummies for each month in the 14 month sample
period to control for other seasonal eÔ¨Äects and inÔ¨Çation.
We control for the number of months between when a car was sold and its introduction.
This proxies for how ‚Äúhot‚Äù a car is and what the opportunity cost of not selling it is for the
dealer. Judging by the distribution of sales after car introductions we distinguish between sales
in the Ô¨Årst four months, months 5-13, and month 14 and later and assign a dummy variable to
each category.
Finally, we also control for the region in which the car was sold according to the deÔ¨Ånition
of a region by JDPA as ‚ÄúNorthern California‚Äù and ‚ÄúSouthern California.‚Äù

Results

We will Ô¨Årst describe who uses Autobytel.com and how their behavior diÔ¨Äers from others. Next
we analyze whether use of Autobytel.com alters the average price a consumer expects to pay
for her car using hedonic regressions. We end with a discussion of trade-ins, dealer proÔ¨Åts, and
dealer costs.

5.1

Unconditional diÔ¨Äerences across customers and dealers

Table 1 contains descriptive statistics for the entire dataset. Three percent of customers submitted a purchase request through Autobytel.com on average. There is variation in this percentage
across segments in the data (see tables 9 to 15 starting on page 28 in the appendix). For example, less than one percent of pickup purchases but almost Ô¨Åve percent of van purchases used
the service. Twenty-eight percent of purchase requests resulted in a sale at the referred dealer,
although this also varies by segment. The luxury and van segments have lower close rates,
while pickup and SUV segments have higher rates. Thirty-three percent of transactions went
through dealerships who are signed up with Autobytel.com. The average car in the sample sold
for $23,580 and earned the dealer almost $1700 in gross proÔ¨Åt. Most segments (van, sporty,
SUV) earned close to $2000 proÔ¨Åt, while luxury cars earned more and compact and mid-sized
cars earned less ($1000) for the dealer. The price including aftermarket options, documentary preparation charge, service contract premium, license, title, registration, and sales taxes

12

is the TotalPrice listed in the table. It is three thousand dollars more than the vehicle price.
Most customers Ô¨Ånance their car through the dealer: about 75% in our sample. The average
amount Ô¨Ånanced, conditional on any Ô¨Ånancing is $22,350, corresponding to 83% of TotalPrice.
The average proÔ¨Åt earned by the dealer on Ô¨Ånancing is $312. The average vehicle stayed on
a dealer‚Äôs lot for 40 days before being sold. There is not enough diÔ¨Äerence between Northern
and Southern California to report the data separately, except that Southern Californians are
more likely to purchase from their referred dealer (32% vs. 26%).

We expect to see a diÔ¨Äerence between customers who use Autobytel.com and those who don‚Äôt
if Autobytel.com users have higher incomes or education levels and therefore behave diÔ¨Äerently
and buy diÔ¨Äerent kinds of cars. Table 2 contains means and medians for a subset of variables
according to whether the customer used Autobytel.com or not. Median price is higher for
the ABT customers ($1,172), as we expected (since we are not conditioning on car type in any
way). Mean proÔ¨Åts on the vehicle earned by the dealers are very similar between the two groups;
however, unconditional median proÔ¨Åts are $169 higher for non-ABT customers. TotalProÔ¨Åt on
the customer is also signiÔ¨Åcantly lower for Autobytel.com customers. Perhaps because they
are less aÔ¨Ñuent or less Ô¨Ånancially sophisticated, 76% of non-ABT customers obtain Ô¨Ånancing
from the dealer, while only 64% of ABT customers do so. The amount customers Ô¨Ånance,
conditional on obtaining Ô¨Ånancing, is slightly higher for non-ABT customers. Other notable
diÔ¨Äerences between the two groups are in DaysToTurn, which is very low for Autobytel.com
customers. This reÔ¨Çects the practice of re-setting the ‚Äúclock‚Äù to zero when the car changes
dealerships. A car that is obtained from another dealership especially for an online customer

will sit on its new lot a very short time. TradeInOverAllowance is lower for the ABT group,
which is something we will discuss in detail later in the paper.
Eighteen percent of ABT customers buy insurance or a repair contract from the dealer, as
compared to 29% of the rest of the sample. Table 3 contains demographics according to whether
the customer used Autobytel.com or not. These are census data from the block where the
customer lives. Unfortunately, we do not have individual buyer demographics. Autobytel.com
customers come from census blocks that are more male, more professional, and higher educated.
Average income in these census blocks is $67,000 rather than $58,000 for the non-Autobytel.com
group. Census blocks with Autobytel.com customers also have fewer farm workers and fewer
African-American residents.
ABT franchise dealers are also diÔ¨Äerent from non-ABT franchise dealers as shown in Table 4.
They are much larger: on average they sell 767 cars during our time period as compared to 346
for non-ABT franchise dealers. ABTFranchise dealers sell about 3.6% of their cars through
Autobytel.com. Non-ABTFranchise dealers pick up some ABT customers who switch dealers;

Conditional Prices

As discussed above, our primary interest is whether use of Autobytel.com alters the average
price a consumer expects to pay for her car. The dependent variable we use is Price as deÔ¨Åned
15

above. In order to provide the appropriate baseline for the price of the car, we use a standard
hedonic regression on log price. We work in logs because many of the attributes of the car, such
as being sold in Northern California or in December, are not appropriate to model as a Ô¨Åxed
dollar increment, but will be a percentage of the car‚Äôs value. Our explanatory variables are ‚Äúcar‚Äù
dummies (which are make * model * body type * doors * drive train * trim * transmission *
cylinders * displacement * model year), month dummies, an indicator for southern California,
and indicators for whether the car was sold on a weekend or at the end of the month. An OLS
regression of log price on only these controls (not reported) results in an adjusted R-squared
of .94. Such a high R-squared is an indication that the options we cannot measure are not a
large part of the variation in car prices.
Table 5 on page 17 shows the results when we include an ABT indicator in the regression.
Its coeÔ¨Écient is -.016 and it is signiÔ¨Åcantly diÔ¨Äerent from zero at below the 1% level. This
means a typical ABT consumer pays 1.6% less for her car, a savings of $379 for the average
car purchased by this group. In another regression (not reported) we include Ô¨Åxed eÔ¨Äects
for each dealer and the ABT indicator. In this speciÔ¨Åcation the coeÔ¨Écient on ABT drops to
negative 1.2%, which is a savings of $284 on the average ABT car. Again, these are conservative
estimates because the comparison group contains both ‚Äústreet‚Äù and Internet sales.
What do these estimates say about dealership‚Äôs proÔ¨Åtability? It depends crucially on both
how many of the Autobytel.com sales are incremental and the dealership‚Äôs costs of selling over
the Internet. If a dealer can use the low prices he oÔ¨Äers through Autobytel.com to capture share
from other dealers, the (possibly lower) margins on those cars are simply additional proÔ¨Åt, not
losses. In addition, the dealer may in fact earn a larger margin on his Autobytel.com sales
than his traditional sales due to the low costs of serving Internet consumers. We obtained
accounting data from one dealer in the midwest who breaks out his Internet sales separately.
We compared his costs (phone, computer, managerial time, oÔ¨Éce supplies, delivery charges,
etc.) to average dealer costs from the National Auto Dealers Association (NADA) and our
estimates.13 The diÔ¨Äerence between the average total cost of a traditional sale in our data
($1575) and his Autobytel.com average cost ($940) is over $600.14 Comparing this number to
our estimate of the expected price drop for Internet sales of between $300 and $500 provides one
reason for dealers to sign up with Autobytel.com: their margins may increase. This particular
dealership estimates that 60% of its Internet sales are incremental and 40% are cannibalization
of traditional sales. The net proÔ¨Åt per car sold through Autobytel.com at this dealership is
13

We use the proÔ¨Åt margin from NADA of $198 and the JDPA median gross margin of $1773 to infer average
cost.
14
Other estimates are higher. An analysts report states that ‚ÄúAccording to NADA numbers, the average new
car sales costs a dealer about $1,270 in personnel and marketing costs. The Autobytel.com service reduces these
costs by as much as $1,000.‚Äù Lehman Brothers, ‚ÄúAutobytel.com,‚Äù 5/12/1999

$440, while the average net proÔ¨Åt per car sold in the traditional manner is $198 according to
NADA. Summing the ‚Äúlost‚Äù margin from the traditional sales (at $198) and the additional
margin from Internet sales (at $440) leads to a net gain for this dealer of about thirty thousand
dollars from selling 89 cars per month over the Internet. However, we do not have an estimate of
the lost contribution to overhead from the traditional sales that now Ô¨Çow through the Internet
division, nor do we have an estimate of rental costs for the Internet division. Any estimate
of these costs that falls under $889 will leave the dealership better oÔ¨Ä from its Internet sales.
Notice that while these calculations suggest that referral services are beneÔ¨Åcial to an aÔ¨Éliated
dealer, since many Internet sales seem to be incremental, non-aÔ¨Éliated dealerships are likely
to be worse oÔ¨Ä as a result of referral services.
The second column of Table 5 shows the coeÔ¨Écients from our main speciÔ¨Åcation with ABT,
ABTFranchise, and SameDealer included. Purchasing a car from an Autobytel.com dealer
saves the purchaser .44% of the cost of the car, regardless of whether the customer ever went
online. Note, however, that the ABT coeÔ¨Écient is unchanged. There are two explanations for
these results. One is that Autobytel.com chooses the lower-priced dealerships to partner with
and this is another beneÔ¨Åt users receive, or alternatively, lower-cost dealerships gain more from
partnering with Autobytel.com. The second reason might be that dealerships interested in the
web often sign up with more than one referral service. Thus the lower-than-average prices at
these dealerships may represent sales to all online customers. However, because Autobytel.com
had a large market share in 1999, one would expect the ABTFranchise coeÔ¨Écient in a regression
by itself to be higher than when the ABT indicator is also included. However, the coeÔ¨Écient
only diÔ¨Äers by .0002, hardly any change at all. This favors the selection explanations above.
Hence we will include the savings from being sent to an Autobytel.com dealer as part of the
customer‚Äôs total gain from the service. The combined savings from the two eÔ¨Äects is $483 per
Autobytel.com customer. Since the average customer has a 33% likelihood of shopping at an
Autobytel.com dealer at random (weighted by sales volume), the overall expected savings to
an average customer is $379 plus $72 (two-thirds of .0044 times average price), or $451.
SameDealer ‚Äôs coeÔ¨Écient is insigniÔ¨Åcant, indicating consumers do not systematically gain
or lose by staying with the dealer referred to them by Autobytel.com. This result is likely due
to a mix of consumers who choose to leave their referral: some Ô¨Ånd a better price elsewhere,
others accept a higher price from a better (e.g. more conveniently located) dealer.
Figure 1 represents the distribution of ‚Äúbargaining outcomes‚Äù after we control for the characteristics of the car and transaction in the regression. It is a histogram of the residuals from
our baseline speciÔ¨Åcation (controls and an ABT indicator) omitting the residuals of customers
who used Autobytel.com. The very small residuals represent oÔ¨Ñine consumers who received
large discounts, while the long right tail represents customers who paid more than others. The

Figure 1: Histogram of residuals from Table 5 column 1 for ABT=0
coeÔ¨Écients on ABT and ABTFranchise from Table 5 column 2 sum to -2.04%. A vertical
line at this point is drawn on the Ô¨Ågure to show where the average Autobytel.com customer
appears in the ‚Äúbargaining outcome‚Äù distribution. The Ô¨Ågure shows that a consumer receiving
the mean Autobytel.com price does better than 61% of the customers who do not use the service. The spike of customers near the mean Autobytel.com discount suggests that other online
purchases might be located around this level also. To the extent this is true, our calculation of
the advantage of online purchasing is conservative.
We also run our main speciÔ¨Åcation on each segment of the data separately, to see if the ABT
coeÔ¨Écient is sensitive to the class of car being sold. The results are reported in Table 18 on
page 33 in the appendix. There is considerably variation across segment in the price discount
for online consumers. Consumers who purchase a pickup truck on the Internet pay 4% less
than oÔ¨Ñine consumers. Both ‚Äúsporty‚Äù and ‚Äúcompact‚Äù customers pay 2.4% less. In contrast,
the discount for luxury and van customers is below 1% and only signiÔ¨Åcant at the 5% level,
and the SUV discount is below average also. The anecdotal explanation for the ‚Äúluxury‚Äù result
is that due to the economic boom in 1999, demand was outstripping the supply of these cars
so that no matter what channel a customer used, the price was not discounted signiÔ¨Åcantly. A

19

similar story might hold for the SUV segment also.
We know the time frame the customer had in mind when at the Autobytel.com site: 48
hours, two weeks, or 30 days. We also know the number of days between submitting a purchase
request and the formal sale of the vehicle. (Coding the Ô¨Årst variable as 1,2,3 results in a
signiÔ¨Åcant correlation between them of 0.2.) If the Internet were primarily serving as a more
convenient method of purchasing, we might see higher prices for those consumers who are in a
hurry (time frame of 48hrs). If, instead, the consumers who use the Internet search, learn, and
make decisions in advance, then a short time frame indicates someone who knows exactly what
she wants. We include the buyer‚Äôs time frame lag in the price speciÔ¨Åcations above and report
the results in Table 5. We Ô¨Ånd that people ‚Äúready to buy‚Äù save 0.5% of the value of the car on
top of the slightly smaller 1.4% saved by using Autobytel.com overall in this speciÔ¨Åcation. In
this speciÔ¨Åcation the total decrease in price on the average car by a ready-to-buy consumer at
an ABT dealer compared to a non-ABT dealer is $550.
The next set of results reports similar speciÔ¨Åcations on a measure of price that includes extra
charges a customer can pay such as service contract premia and aftermarket options (AMOs).
Aftermarket options are the fabric protectors and paint sealants that as JDPA politely states,
‚Äúdo not add to the blue book value of the car.‚Äù We regress this Price w/ AMOs (logged) on the
same set of controls as well as ABT, ABTFranchise, and SameDealer. Our results, reported in
Table 6 on page 21, are very similar except that the ABT coeÔ¨Écient and the ABTFranchise
coeÔ¨Écient increase in magnitude (total 2.6%). We suspect that consumers who use the Internet
have better information about these high-margin products. Better information would lead a
consumer to back away from buying fabric protectant and service contracts. Although it could
be the case that educated customers choose to use Autobytel.com rather than the other way
around, we do know that the percentage of customers who buy either a service contract or an
aftermarket option or both is 10% higher for non-ABT customers.

5.3

Trade-in pricing, dealer proÔ¨Åts, and Ô¨Ånancing

An interesting diÔ¨Äerence between Autobytel.com customers and others appears in the distribution of proÔ¨Åts between the new vehicle and the trade-in. Autobytel.com customers make
less proÔ¨Åt on their trade-ins, although they end up better oÔ¨Ä overall. As reported in column
2 of Table 6, dealers oÔ¨Äer on average $350 less for an Autobytel.com customer‚Äôs old vehicle,
conditional on the value of the vehicle (this speciÔ¨Åcation does not contain car dummies, but
does contain dealer dummies). Dealers seem to compensate with higher new car prices for the
fact that they pay ‚Äútoo much‚Äù for trade-ins: an average of $770 above the ‚Äúactual cash value‚Äù

of the trade-in.15 Therefore, the average trade-in customer in our dataset sees an ABT contract
price that is about $800 less than non-ABT oÔ¨Ñine prices, but receives about $350 less for her
trade-in, making the net savings about $450. It is also interesting to note that consumers who
trade in their old vehicles pay on average 0.7% more for their new vehicle than consumers that
have no trade-in (see the dummy AnyTrade in column 3 of Table 6). Recall that the dependent
variable price above is adjusted for the TradeInOverAllowance. The interaction coeÔ¨Écient in
the table shows that the price premium that ABT customers pay when they trade in their old
car is no more or less than the premium paid by others whose transactions include trade-ins.
Since an online consumer is more likely to be comparing prices before the trade-in is discussed,
dealers may be unwilling to quote a high price for the new car in order to be able to subsidize
a trade-in later. However, it appears that a small overall price premium is charged to both
online and oÔ¨Ñine consumers who trade in an old car.
Perhaps the most interesting dependent variable to study is the proÔ¨Åts the dealer earns on
the car and on the customer. Since we do not have data on a dealership‚Äôs overhead expenses, we
will analyze the gross margin rather than true proÔ¨Åts. We use a standard linear speciÔ¨Åcation
and measure margins in dollars. The results are reported in Table 7 columns 1 and 2 on
page 23. Column 1 lists the results of regressing the dealer‚Äôs gross margin on the vehicle
on our set of controls and the ABT indicator. Autobytel.com customers earn dealers $303
less per car, on average. This point estimate compares well to the $379 discount estimated
above. Evidence previously discussed suggests that these customers are cheaper to serve than
traditional customers, so they may be as proÔ¨Åtable to the dealership overall. Turning our
attention to the total proÔ¨Åt on the customer (Ô¨Ånancing, service plans, insurance, etc. plus the
vehicle), we Ô¨Ånd that ABT customers give the dealer $464 less in proÔ¨Åt. This complements the
results above, where we saw that ABT customers pay less for, or are less likely to buy, these
aftermarket items. This larger estimate also increases the dealer cost savings required to keep
sales to ABT customers proÔ¨Åtable.
Table 7 also shows that the cost of acquiring the vehicle is not diÔ¨Äerent between ABT
customers and non-ABT customers (column 4). In addition, ABT franchises face a slightly
higher cost of vehicles: $57 according to the coeÔ¨Écient in the table. If Autobytel.com sales are
lower cost than conventional sales, this must be due to lower overhead costs such as salespeople‚Äôs
salaries and real estate rents.
Note that we are unable to discriminate between two diÔ¨Äerent interpretations of the above
results. If Autobytel.com or the Internet in general is helping to educate previously naive
15

This is consistent with Goldberg (1996) who analyzes contract prices and Ô¨Ånds that customers with trade-in
vehicles pay on average $600 more for their new car.

consumers who then avoid aftermarket options and insurance, or bargain harder for them,
then the use of the Internet by consumers is reducing dealer proÔ¨Åts. On the other hand, if
these customers would have obtained information from books and friends in the absence of the
Internet, there is no change in dealer proÔ¨Åts; this group would not have purchased aftermarket
options or insurance regardless of the Internet.
We present two analyses that begin to separate the selection eÔ¨Äect from the bargaining/lowercost eÔ¨Äect. Three-quarters of the customers in our sample obtain Ô¨Ånancing from the dealer.
Sixty-four percent of ABT customers use dealer Ô¨Ånancing and 76% of non-ABT customers do.
Autobytel.com and the Internet provide information and bargaining power that could help customers get the best rate. The most Ô¨Ånancially-savvy individuals will obtain Ô¨Ånancing over the
web or from a non-dealer source. We restrict the sample to customers who obtained Ô¨Ånancing
from the dealer in order to exclude these sophisticated buyers and weaken the selection eÔ¨Äect.
We run a tobit (censored regression) on dealer proÔ¨Åt from Ô¨Ånancing, which is often zero. The
results are reported in column 3 of Table 7. ABT customers contribute about $88 less to
dealer proÔ¨Åt from Ô¨Ånancing, although Autobytel.com franchises collect $18 more in Ô¨Ånancing
proÔ¨Åt from an average customer than other dealers. These results suggest Autobytel.com helps
customers with information and bargaining clout.
Table 8 examines how price dispersion at the dealer level varies with the amount of Autobytel.com business the dealership has. We use residuals from our baseline regression (no ABT
variables) to construct residuals. We create a dealer variance variable, which is simply the
variance of those error terms by dealer. We then regress this measure on the percentage of the
dealer‚Äôs sales that are to Autobytel.com customers and whether or not the dealership has a
contract with Autobytel.com. The second column in the table adds the dealership‚Äôs size, the
percentage of its customers who Ô¨Ånance their cars, and the percentage of its Autobytel.com
customers who do not switch dealerships. We see in both speciÔ¨Åcations that the coeÔ¨Écient on
Autobytel.com percentage is negative and signiÔ¨Åcant. Selling more cars through Autobytel.com
reduces price dispersion at the dealership level. This indicates that we are not simply seeing
the same customers and distribution of proÔ¨Åt levels Ô¨Çowing through new channels. Instead,
the Internet is altering the shape of the proÔ¨Åt distribution. Dealerships that engage in more
Ô¨Ånancing have higher levels of dispersion, but a contract with Autobytel.com is not related to
dispersion levels. We plan to investigate dispersion across and within dealerships more fully in
future research.

Concluding remarks

This paper investigates the eÔ¨Äect of Internet referral services on retail auto prices and dealer
proÔ¨Åts. We show that the Internet has changed the product market behavior of dealerships.
While the Internet performs the expected roles of reducing search costs and serving consumers‚Äô
information needs, it also is changing Ô¨Årm pricing behavior in an important sector of the
economy.
In this paper we capitalize on the fact that Internet purchase referral services do not control
the prices oÔ¨Äered by the dealer. This means that prices that are oÔ¨Äered to consumers continue
to be the choice variable of dealers, whether or not a consumer walked into the showroom or
was referred by an Internet service. We show that conditional on the dealer, consumers that
submitted a purchase request save about $379. Including the eÔ¨Äect of being sent to a low-price
dealer chosen by Autobytel.com the savings increase to $450. We also show that dealer gross
margins on the sale of a vehicle to a customer with an Internet purchase referral are signiÔ¨Åcantly
lower than gross margins earned selling the vehicle the traditional way. However, because online
customers are cheaper to serve, the dealer may nonetheless be better oÔ¨Ä working with Internet
purchase referral services. We also Ô¨Ånd that proÔ¨Åts earned by the dealer on extra services
are lower for an online than oÔ¨Ñine customer. We examine price dispersion at the dealership
level and Ô¨Ånd that it declines in the amount of Autobytel.com business the dealership has,
indicating that the Internet referral service is altering the distribution of prices. We conclude
that consumers can gain from using the Internet to help purchase a new car and that the
Internet has changed the product market behavior of dealerships.
By altering the size and distribution of dealer proÔ¨Åts, the Internet has the potential to

25

signiÔ¨Åcantly change the structure of the retail automobile industry. There are a number of
research avenues we intend to pursue that will help us understand these changes. We are
interested in the eÔ¨Äect of Internet sales on price dispersion within and across dealerships because
this could shed light on how rents are shifting between consumers and dealers and among dealers
themselves. We are exploring ways to decompose the online price decrease into the amount
due to the bargaining power of the Internet referral service and the amount due to the cost
savings inherent in being an online customer. We also plan to use the demographic information
in the dataset to examine whether race and gender discrimination is present and whether it is
aÔ¨Äected by using an Internet purchase referral service.
