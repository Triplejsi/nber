Introduction

Every four years it begins anew, the hand-wringing and finger-pointing over a
poor showing at the Olympics. The only real uncertainty is which countries
will feel the sharpest disappointment over their poor performances. After the
Barcelona Olympics, a headline in the New York Times read “Despite its 108
medals, U.S. rates mixed success.” In 1996, headlines in London trumpeted
“Olympic shame over Britain’s medal tally” and “Britain in danger of being
left at the starting line,”1 while in Mexico, Japan, Singapore, Colombia and
Egypt, medal totals below expectations led to national self-examinations.
After Sydney, in Canada the Globe and Mail bemoaned “Canada’s Olympic
fears come true: Despite a few bright spots, athletes not only won fewer
medals, they performed below their own and nation’s expectations.”2 In this
paper, we ask the straightforward question of how many medals countries
should be expected to win by considering what factors influence national
Olympic success.3
One possible avenue of inquiry would be to assess sport by sport the athletic talent in each country and predict the likelihood of success in each event.
We then could then generate a prediction for a national medal total by summing across sports. We suspect this is the method employed by most national
Olympic committees when oﬀering predictions about how many medals their
countries will win. We follow a diﬀerent path by generalizing from individual sports.4 While this has the disadvantage of missing nation-specific
expertise in a particular event, it has what we believe is the larger advantage
of averaging over the random component inherent in individual competition,
enabling us to make more accurate predictions of national medal totals.
1

The first paragraph of the subsequent editorial in The Times of London began, “John
Major wants a successful sporting nation, rightly believing that it reflects a healthy nation.
He needs to direct urgent attention to the somnolent government administration if Great
Britain is not to become an international laughing stock. The British Olympic Association
(BOA) today holds its annual meeting with a debriefing from Craig Reedie, the chairman,
on the Games in Atlanta, where Britain’s tally of 15 medals was perceived at home as
being unsatisfactory.”
2
Headlines in the U.S., Germany, New Zealand, India, and South Africa also worried
about pooring showings in Sydney.
3
We look only at performance in the summer Games. All references to the Olympics
or Games refer to the summer Games.
4
This is driven at least in part by our self-professed ignorance about the sports in
question. See footnote 24 for evidence on this point.

Even the most ardent xenophobes would not suggest that a single country
should win all the medals, or even all the gold medals, at a given Olympic
Games. The real question is how many medals qualify as a successful performance by a national team. There have been several attempts to put
national medal totals in some sort of perspective.5 In 1996 after the Atlanta Games, Eurostat announced that the European Union had “won” the
Olympic Games since the 15 member countries had both more medals and
more medals per capita than the United States (08/15/1996 USA Today).
The United Nations Population Information Network went a step further by
declaring Tonga the winner of the Games with a medal to population ratio
more than twice as high as the nearest competitor (9.4 medals per million
inhabitants).6
Population should play a role in determining country medal totals. Larger
countries have a deeper pool of talented athletes and thus a greater chance
at fielding medal winners. We present and test a simple theory of medal success based on population coupled with assumptions about the distribution
of Olympic calibre athletic talent. We consider both the probability that a
country wins at least one medal as well as the share of total medals it wins.
Pure population levels are not suﬃcient to explain national totals. If
they were, China, India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh with 43+ percent of the
world’s population would have won more than the 6+ percent of total medals
in 1996 that they actually won. We recognize the importance of available
resources in enabling gifted athletes to train for, attend, and succeed in the
Games. To this end, we extend the population based model to include a
measure of resources per person in the form of GDP per capita.
The addition of per capita GDP dramatically improves the ability of the
model to fit the data. While China, India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh have
a huge share of world population, together they account for under 5 percent
of world GDP in 1996, roughly equal to their share of medals. The main
results are quite sharp. Over time, a country’s real GDP remains the single
best predictor of Olympic performance. Population and per capita GDP
contribute equally at the margin implying that two countries with identical
levels of GDP but diﬀerent populations and per capita GDP levels will win
5

While there is nothing in the recent academic literature on national Olympic performance, it was an active area of research in the early 1970’s. See Ball (1972), Levine
(1974), and Grimes, Kelly, and Rubin (1974).

the same number of medals.
While GDP is most of the story, it is not the whole story. Host countries
typically win an additional 1.8 percent of the medals beyond what would
be predicted by their GDP alone. The forced mobilization of resources by
governments clearly can also play a role in medal totals. On average, the
Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries won a share of medals higher by 3+
percentage points than predicted by their GDP.7
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data
employed in the empirical analysis. Section 3 presents a population-based
model of Olympic success. Section 4 presents a national production function
for Olympic medals. Section 5 predicts medal-winning in the Sydney 2000
Olympics, and Section 6 concludes.

Data

The data for this project consist of two main components: Olympic medal
counts and socio-economic indicators. We obtained the medal data from
Wallechinsky (1992) and direct correspondence with the International Olympic
Committee (IOC). For our socio-economic indicators, we would ideally like
to have a range of indicators including population, income per capita, income
inequality and government spending. However, the diﬃculty of obtaining
such measures for more than 150 countries over 30 years precludes us from
considering anything but GDP and population. Our primary source for both
these measures was the World Bank and the U.N. (see the Appendix for a
more complete description).8

3

A simple theory of population and Olympic
success

To organize our thinking about the sources of Olympic success, we start by
considering the underlying distribution of athletic talent. As with most
7

Shughart and Tollison (1993) argue that the change in the structure in economic
incentives in the former Soviet countries is responsible for their lower medal totals in the
1992 Olympics.
8
There are numerous judgement calls required in assembling real GDP data for countries in the former Soviet Union, China, and many protectorates.

physical attributes, athletic talent is most likely distributed normally in the
world’s population. If we think of countries as being arbitrary divisions of
the world population, then we should expect to find medal-calibre athletes
in proportion to the country’s share of world population. If medals are
proportional to athletic talent, then we would expect to find the following
relationship in the distribution of Olympic medals. For country i
medalsi
olympic talenti
populationi
medalsharei = P
=P
=
. (1)
world population
j medalsj
j olympic talentj

Equation 1 will hold only if every country participates in the Olympics
which is not generally the case. The actual relationship predicted by the
talent distribution is therefore that the share of medals accruing to a country
should be equal to its share of the total population of countries participating
in the Olympics,
medalsi
populationi
=P
= popsharei .
medalsharei = P
j medalsj
j populationj

(2)

Equation 2 is easily tested empirically. Since there are many countries
that win no medals at all, another relevant implication of Equation 2 is that
the probability that a country wins at least one medal should be increasing
in the country’s population share.
There are several reasons related to the structure of the Olympics themselves to think that the linear relationship in Equation 2 will not hold in
practice. First, countries cannot send athletes in proportion to their populations to compete in each event. This is most easily seen in the team
competitions where each country has at most one entrant. Second, in medal
counts, team events count as one medal even though a country must provide
a number of athletes. This means that even if a country is able to send
athletes in proportion to its size, it may still win a smaller share of medals
than its size would predict. Finally, and perhaps most important for our
analysis, the number of athletes that a country may send to the Olympics is
determined by the IOC in negotiation with the country’s Olympic committee. As a result, not all the Olympic calibre athletes from a large country
are able to participate.9 We allow for these nonlinearities in our empirical
9

For example, qualifying to be a member of the US Olympic team in track and field is
considered to be as diﬃcult as winning a medal; former medalists regularly fail to qualify.
In the 2000 Olympic trials two record-holders, Michael Johnson and Maurice Green, failed
to qualify for the 200 meter dash.

Results

This section empirically tests the talent hypothesis as specified in Equation
2. We begin with a probit model that tests the more general implication
of Equation 2, namely that the probability of winning a medal should be
increasing in population share. The results of this estimation, reported as
marginal probability eﬀects, are reported in Table 1. As predicted by the
model, the probability that a country will win at least one medal is increasing
in its population share. However, the fit of the model seems quite poor.
Using a 0.5 cutoﬀ probability, the model correctly predicts the medal status
65 percent of the time. However, almost all these correct predictions come
from the pool of countries that do not win medals. The model predicts that
only 6 percent of the countries would win medals instead of the actual 39
percent.11
As mentioned above, we have reason to believe that medal winning will
not be directly proportional to population shares because of the structure of
the Olympics themselves. The nature of the deviation from the simple theory
is one-sided in that larger countries will win fewer medals than predicted by
their population shares while smaller countries will win more. There are an
infinite number of possible alternative specifications that we could implement
to account for these deviations but for the sake of simplicity we will limit
10

In a contemporaneous paper, Johnson and Ali (2000) investigate the economic and
political determinants of participation at the games.

The results of estimating a probit in log-levels of population shares are
given in Table 1. Again using 0.5 probability cutoﬀ, the fit of the specification is now dramatically improved. Over 72 percent of the observations
are predicted correctly, and the model predicts that 31 percent of the countries will win medals. Mispredictions are still more likely in the direction of
missing an actual medal winner.
Next we turn to the medal shares themselves. Equation 2 predicts that
medal shares will be increasing one-for-one in population shares. Results
from a tobit regression estimating this specification are reported in Table 2.
While population share is positive and significant, the estimated coeﬃcient
is significantly below one. The second column of Table 2 reports the same
tobit in log levels of the population share. The fit is substantially improved
with an increase in the log-likelihood. The coeﬃcient estimate in the second
column indicates that if average country were to double its population, it
would win an additional 1.5% of the medals awarded.
Figure 1 gives a visual depiction of the fit of the estimation. The number
of medals actually won by each country in 1996 is plotted along the horizontal
axis, with the predicted values from the tobit specification in log levels of
population share plotted on the vertical axis.13 If the model fit the data
perfectly, all observations would fall on the 45 degree line. The figure shows
that the specification does particularly poorly in capturing the countries with

This will apply for the rest of the paper as well.
Figure 1 omits countries that did not win a medal in 1996 to make the image less

A production function for Olympic medals

To augment our model we now turn to the role of economic resources in
generating Olympic medals. We choose to frame our analysis in terms of a
production technology. In the previous section, we assumed that talented
athletes were randomly distributed in the world population. However, there
is a large and lengthy process involved in becoming an Olympic athlete and
this process involves the allocation of resources, either by individuals or by
an organization, most likely the central government.
Our production function for generating Olympic calibre athletes for a
country i in year t requires people, money, and some organizational ability.14
Ti = f (Ni , Yi , Ai )

There is no theoretical guidance on the precise form of either f (·) or

the translation of relative talent to medal shares.

with the properties that increases in medals are less than one-for-one in

The term ‘organizational’ is merely a shorthand for all the possible reasons that countries may have high or low medal counts.

Results from the production function

As mentioned in Section 3, there are many participating countries who win
no medals in a given Olympics. For this reason, we estimate Equation 7 with
a tobit specification. Table 3 reports the results of this estimation. The
dependent variable is the country medal share and all specifications include
time dummies.
Both log population and log GDP per capita enter with positive and significant coeﬃcients. The addition of a measure of national income dramatically improves the fit over the univariate specification with log population
only, reported in Table 2. Interestingly, the coeﬃcients on the two variables,
although statistically distinguishable, are very similar, pointing toward log
GDP itself as the relevant determinant of the share of medals a country wins.
The second column of Table 3 reports the results including country random
eﬀects. We find again that the coeﬃcients on the two explanatory variables
are positive, significant, and of similar magnitude.
The coeﬃcients estimated in this section can be loosely interpreted to
mean that if the average country were to double its total GDP, it could
expect the number of medals it wins to rise by 1-1.5% of the total awarded.

4.2

Additions to the model

The empirical specification given in Equation 7 shifts all country-specific
information not included in GDP and population into the error term. In
this section we explore some of the additional factors that might augment
or diminish medal shares including the advantages of hosting, the medal
premium enjoyed by the former Soviet Union and its satellites, and the role
10

of large scale boycotts.
Hosts have several potential advantages over other Olympic participants.
First, the cost of attending the Olympics for individual athletes is minimized.
In addition, host countries can tailor facilities to meet the needs of their
athletes and may gain an edge if home crowd enthusiasm sways judges.16
Individual athletes may be more motivated to achieve Olympic fame when
the events are conducted in front of friends and family. Finally, host countries
are influential in the addition of new sports to the Games themselves. All
these factors suggest that hosts should enjoy supranormal medal shares when
the Games are in their country.
One of the most interesting questions regarding Olympic medal totals
over the past 40 years concerns the ability of countries to ‘manufacture’ gold
medals. Concern about this process stems from the apparent success of
the former Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. These countries
clearly accumulated large quantities of Olympic gold, silver, and bronze over
the years. However, the unconditional medal totals cannot tell us how
successful they were at mobilizing resources. We create two dummy variables
to capture these eﬀects. The first covers countries distinctly inside the Soviet
sphere of influence while the second includes other non-market, typically
communist, countries.17 We consider the additional medals for these groups
after controlling for income and population to provide a first estimate of the
power of central planning in the Olympic race.18
Two Olympics in the era we examine were subject to large scale boycotts,
those in 1980 and in 1984. Heretofore all our results have included those
Olympics.19 The coeﬃcients on the host dummy and the dummies for the
centrally planned economies are likely to be particularly sensitive to the
inclusion of these Games and so we provide some evidence on the robustness
of our results excluding the 1980 and 1984 Games.
16

This was certainly the US perception of the results for selected boxing matches in the
1988 Olympics.
17
The ‘soviet’ dummy includes Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the USSR, East Germany, Hungary, and Romania from 1960-1988, the Unified Team in 1992 and Cuba
throughout the period. The other ‘planned’ dummy include China, Albania, Yugoslavia
(through 1988), and North Korea.
18
We should caution again that our GDP per capita numbers for these countries are far
from perfect.
19
All the results of the previous sections are robust to the omission of these boycotted
Olympics.

Table 4 reports the tobit specification for medal shares with and without
the boycotted years. The results for population and GDP per capita are
largely unchanged; they are positive, significant and of the same magnitude
as each other and are similar to those reported in Table 3. In two of the
specifications, the coeﬃcients on population and GDP per capita are statistically identical. The ‘Soviet’ countries do successfully increase their medal
totals with shares more than 3 percentage points higher than other countries. Similarly, the group of other planned economies have shares that are
higher by roughly 1.7 percentage points than those in the benchmark noncommunist countries after controlling for income and population. Neither
of these eﬀects is sensitive to the exclusion of the boycotted Games.
The host eﬀect on medal totals is also positive and significant. The bump
in medal share from hosting a non-boycotted Olympics is almost 1.2 percentage points. During the boycotted Games the host eﬀects were enormous, on
the order of 19 percentage points, suggesting that the US and USSR were the
prime beneficiaries from each other’s boycotts in terms of medal counts.20
We finish by considering the adequacy of our sparse specification for the
purposes of prediction. Given the lack of adequate summary statistics for the
tobit, we instead present the results visually. Figure 2 shows the relationship
between the predicted medal shares and actual medal shares for 1996 from
our augmented tobit excluding the boycotted years (column II of Table 4).
If the prediction were perfect all the country codes would line up on the
45 degree line. Predictions below (above) the 45 degree line are low (high)
relative to the actual number of medals.21 The model underpredicts medal
shares at both the low and high ends of the range and overpredicts in the
middle. While the additions of log GDP per capita and several dummies
have improved the fit substantially, the overall predictive power of the current
model is lacking.
20

The US won 174 of 688 medals awarded in 1984, almost twice what it won in 1976
and 1988.

Figure 2 omits countries that did not win a medal in 1996 to make the image less

Table 4: Tobit of medal share on expanded explanatory set

Time to build

Until now we have implicitly modelled the production of Olympic athletes
and medals as a within period flow process with potentially persistent countryspecific organizational capabilities. However, it is quite likely that Olympic
athletes are more similar to durable capital goods in that they may provide
medal potential over several Olympics. This would suggest that investments
for one Olympics may increase the chance of winning medals in subsequent
Olympics.22 To capture such eﬀects we modify the medal production function
given earlier to include slowly depreciating talent.
In particular, we assume that national Olympic calibre talent is a function
of depreciated past talent and investment in new talent given by
Tit = (1 − δ) Tit−1 + Iit
Iit = f (Ni , Yi , Ai ) = ln Ait + γ ln Nit + θ ln Yit
22

(9)
(10)

There is direct evidence on the persistence of success and failure in the games. The
autocorrelation coeﬃcient of the within-country errors from the earlier specification with
random eﬀects is as high as 0.45.

where T̄t = j Tjt . Equation 12 implies that the coeﬃcients on GDP per

of talent. The coeﬃcient on lagged medal share will be constant over time if
the pool of talent is increasing at a constant rate. For purposes of comparison,
we first estimate the specification including lagged medal share with timeinvariant parameters; in the next section we will allow the parameters to vary
over time.

Results from this specification are given in Table 5. Because of the
inclusion of the lagged dependent variable, we omit the boycotted games
from the sample, and also the 1988 games since the 1984 medal shares are
distorted by the Soviet-led boycott. The coeﬃcients on population and per
capita GDP remain significant and of equal magnitude to each other. Lagged
medal share has a coeﬃcient of 0.76 and is strongly significant.

Changes over time

Equation 12 suggests that we might find changes in the estimated parameters
across years. If the overall pool of Olympic talent is increasing then we
will see decreases in the coeﬃcients on GDP per capita and population.
Intuitively, as the world pool of talent grows, a country needs an ever larger
GDP in order to win the same share of medal. As long as the rate of aggregate

Table 6: Year by year tobit of medal share on expanded explanatory set
talent increase has been roughly constant over time, the coeﬃcient on lagged
medal share will not vary across the years, as can be seen in Equation 12.
In Table 6, we report the coeﬃcients on the specification run year-by-year
without the host dummy (which would perfectly fit the medal share for the
host). The results provide broad confirmation of the simple accumulation
model we oﬀered above. The equality of the coeﬃcients on log population
and log GDP per capita is stable over time. However, the marginal eﬀects of
both variables has been systematically declining over time. The coeﬃcients
on both variables are less than half their 1964 values by 1996. Lagged medal
share is positive and significant in all the non-boycott years with a stable
coeﬃcient around 0.8. In addition, the year-by-year estimates suggest that
the influence of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is on the wane
in recent years.
Including lagged medal share and estimating year by year tobits improves
the fit of the specification substantially compared to the estimates reported in
section 4.2, especially for countries with large medal totals. Figure 3 shows
predicted and actual medals for 1996 from a tobit specification with lagged
medal shares estimated on the post-boycott Olympics.23 The model does

Figure 3 omits countries that did not win a medal in 1996 to make the image less
cluttered.

Figure 3: Predicted and actual medal totals for 1996 from the enhanced tobit
quite well in predicting totals for a number of countries including the USA,
Germany, and China. However, Russia wins more medals than predicted
while Cuba wins far fewer than predicted. Table 7 has a list of medals won
by country and the predictions from the model for that year.
To sum up, the production function approach adds considerably to the
simple talent hypothesis of Section 3. The statistical significance of GDP
per capita indicates, perhaps not surprisingly, that economic resources are
important in producing Olympic medalists. More surprising is the persistent
similarity of the coeﬃcients on log population and log GDP per capita. This
suggests that it is a country’s total GDP that matters in producing Olympic
athletes. This has the implication that two countries with the same GDP
will win approximately the same number of medals, even if one is relatively
populous with lower per capita income and the other is smaller with higher
per capita GDP. Furthermore, this section has identified some important
country characteristics that boost medal totals, including Soviet and host
eﬀects. Finally, there is strong evidence for durability to a country’s Olympic
“investments”. Past success is an indicator of current success; including
lagged medal share further improves the fit of the model.

Predicting Medals in Sydney

To provide a sterner test of our framework, we evaluate its out of sample
performance. To this end, we made public predictions based on the model
several weeks before the 2000 Sydney games.4 To do so, we extended our
data as best we could using recent data on population and GDP growth for
a subset of countries. The most recent, most complete data we had available were from the IMF for 1998 population and GDP. Among the various
specifications, we estimated the 1996 cross-section estimation from Table 6
including lagged medal shares. This specification does not estimate a host
eﬀect, so we use the coeﬃcient on the host dummy for the same specification pooled over all non-boycott years (Table 5). We predict the total medal
counts for the 36 countries that won at least five medals in 1996.
Table 8 contains two sets of predictions for the Sydney Games as well as
the actual medal totals for the 36 countries. Columns 1 and 2 represent the
predictions and standard errors the model would have made if it had been
implemented without error. Column 3 gives the ex-ante predictions made
public before the Sydney games, while column 4 gives the ex-post medal
totals.24
Both sets of predictions, error-free and error-laden, do quite well in matching the outcomes from the games. While the error-free predictions hit only
one total exactly, 9 countries are within one medal of their actual total, and
23 are within 3 medals. Using more formal distance metrics to measure our
forecast performance, the predictions have an R2 of 0.96 and 35 of the 36
countries were within 2 standard errors of the predicted values. The mean
absolute error is 4.3 medals.

Conclusions

In this paper, we examine the question of how many Olympic medals a country should win. We begin with a simple hypothesis that athletic talent is
24

The three mistakes we made in implementing the model were, in order of importance:
(1) using an incorrect total of 888 medals instead of the actual 929, (2) forgetting to include
year dummies in the pooled tobit which gives us the host eﬀect, and (3) estimating the
coeﬃcients with zeros for lagged medal share for both the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
The first mistake resulted from our deep ignorance about individual sports as we were not
aware that the sports of boxing and judo awarded double bronzes. Our perfect, ex-ante
predictions for the U.S. and France do not survive the corrections.

randomly distributed and that therefore medal winning should be proportional to population. We also consider a production function for Olympic
medals that encompasses resources, population and other national characteristics.
While the simple population hypothesis does have explanatory power, it
fails to adequately explain the distribution of medals across countries. We
find significant evidence that other resources, national income in particular,
are important for producing Olympic athletes. Interestingly, per capita
income and population have very similar eﬀects at the margin suggesting
that total GDP is the best predictor of national Olympic performance.
While GDP is most of the story, it is not the whole story. Host countries
typically win an additional 1.8 percent of the medals beyond what would
be predicted by their GDP alone. This host bounce led us to predict that
Australia would win 17 more medals in 2000 than it would have otherwise,
making our medal prediction only one short of the actual total. The forced
mobilization of resources by governments clearly can also play a role in medal
totals. On average, the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries won a share
of medals higher by 3+ percentage points than predicted by their GDP and
past performance during the 1960-1996 period.
We finish by exposing our simple specification to an out of sample test
and predict medal totals for the 2000 summer games in Sydney. The model
does quite well by most statistical metrics.

Appendix

Our primary source for population and GDP data was the World Bank. We
also used United Nations data sources, and for a few observations, the CIA
Factbook, The Economist magazine, and the Taiwan Statistical Planning
Book. Population figures could be found fairly readily; GDP measures were
more diﬃcult. For some countries, especially less developed countries, it
was necessary to interpolate or extrapolate using either reported or imputed
growth rates. Also, there is an ever-present concern about GDP figures from
the Soviet Union and its satellites, China, and protectorates. We do our best
to compile comparable and reasonable data. All GDP figures are converted
to 1995 US dollars using current exchange rates.
