Introduction
What new findings can this paper claim to offer given the wealth of research on PPP
in the past? It first should be noted that empirical support for PPP has waxed and
waned over the years. From an historical standpoint, there have been numerous studies
of PPP for various countries over the period in question, some covering a particular
era or monetary regime. McCloskey and Zecher (1984) argued that PPP worked very
well under the Anglo-American gold standard before 1914. Diebold, Husted, and Rush
(1991) explored a very long run of nineteenth century data for six countries, and found
support for PPP based on the low-frequency information lacking in short-sample studies.
Abauf and Jorion (1990) studied a century of dollar-franc-sterling exchange rate data
and verified PPP; Lothian and M. P. Taylor (1996) found the same for two centuries of
dollar-franc-sterling data. Lothian (1990) also found evidence that real exchange rates
were stationary for Japan, the U.S., the U.K., and France for the period 1875-1986,
although yen exchange rates exhibited only trend-stationarity‚Äîan oft-repeated finding
that the real yen exchange rate has appreciated over the long run against all currencies.
In full length monographs, both Lee (1978) and Officer (1982) found strong evidence
in favor of PPP based on analysis of long time-series running from the pre-1914 gold
standard to the managed float of the 1970s.1
Of late, new studies have appeared in abundance. In their recent comprehensive
review of the purchasing-power parity literature, Froot and Rogoff (1995) could declare
that what was a ‚Äúfairly dull research topic‚Äù only a decade ago has recently been the
focus of substantial controversy and the subject of a growing body of literature. Recent empirical research, mostly based on the time-series analysis of short spans of data
for the floating-rate (post-Bretton Woods) era led many to conclude that PPP failed to
hold, and that the real exchange rate followed a random walk, with no mean-reversion
property. However, a newly emerging literature exploits more data and higher-powered
techniques, and claims that, in the long run, PPP does indeed hold: it appears from
these studies that real exchange rates exhibit mean reversion with a half-life of deviations of four to five years (M. P. Taylor 1995; Froot and Rogoff 1995). The newer
findings use various steps to expand the size of samples used to test PPP. As noted, it has
been possible to use much longer-run time series for certain individual countries, spanning a century or more; typically such exercises have concentrated on more-developed
countries with good historical data availability (for example, U.S., Britain, France).
Alternatively, researchers have expanded the data for the recent float or postwar periods
cross-sectionally to exploit the additional information in panel data (Wei and Parsley
1995; Frankel and Rose 1995; Pedroni 1995; Higgins and Zakraj≈°ek 1999).
It is still too early to say whether the revisionist PPP findings will prove robust, and
already challenges to this interpretation have emerged. One may find fault with the
ways in which cross-section information and panel methodologies have been applied
(O‚ÄôConnell 1996, 1998). Some have noted that the inferences based on panel methods
are sensitive to sample selection, and many results appear sensitive to the choice of base
country, for example, the U.S. versus Germany (Papell 1995; Wei and Parsley 1995;
1 Obviously, this paper builds on a very strong foundation of historical work by a number of scholars,
covering various countries in different time periods. Other studies of long run data are numerous (Frankel
1986; Edison 1987; Johnson 1990; Glen 1992; Kim 1990).

Edison, Gagnon, and Melick 1995). Others caution that detecting a unit root in time
series may be complicated by the fact that price indices can be viewed as the sum of a
stationary tradable relative-price component and a non-stationary non-tradable relativeprice component (Engel 2000; Ng and Perron 1999). This finding echoes the venerable
Balassa-Samuelson objection to the pure PPP hypothesis based on differential rates of
productivity growth in traded and non-traded goods sectors (Balassa 1964; Samuelson
1964). Of course, such long-run trends may be purely deterministic (Obstfeld 1993).
The distinction of the present study is to bring very recent empirical innovations
to a longer span of historical data, both to investigate the robustness of the recent
findings and to explore the historical evolution of PPP. I proceed as follows. Section
2 introduces the real exchange rate data and preliminary analysis shows that old-style
univariate tests cannot reject the unit root null. Section 3 examines a multivariate test
of PPP by M. P. Taylor and Sarno (1998). In the search of a more powerful test, Section
4 applies the univariate efficient tests of Elliott, Rothenberg, and Stock (1996). We find
that long-run PPP can be supported in all cases with allowance for deterministic trends.
The importance of the long-run trends is explained in Section 5 where I model
the dynamics of real exchange rates at different times in the twentieth century. Four
regimes are investigated, the gold standard 1870‚Äì1914, the interwar period 1914‚Äì45, the
Bretton-Woods era 1946‚Äì71, and the recent float 1971‚Äì96. The important quantitative
differences found are in residual variance, and the floating regimes exhibit much larger
shocks to the real exchange rate process, accounting for the much larger deviations
from PPP during these eras. Thus, the history of PPP in the twentieth century shows,
surprisingly, that there was relatively little change in the ability of international market
integration to smooth out real exchange rate shocks. Instead, I argue, the changes in the
variance of the shocks reveal a great deal about the differing degrees to which monetary
policy was kept in check or not by commitment mechanisms (under fixed rates) or their
absence (under floating). In light of this, I end with a discussion that relates these
findings to the question of the political economy of monetary and exchange-rate regime
choice under the constraints imposed by the macroeconomic policy trilemma.

Data and Preliminary Analysis
The data consist of annual exchange rates E it , measured as domestic currency units
per U.S. dollar, and price indices Pit , measured as consumer price deflators‚Äîor, when
they are not available, GDP deflators. We will refer to the log levels of these variables,
denoted eit = log E it and pit = log Pit . The index i = 1, . . . , 20 covers the set
of countries Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The
index t runs over the set of years from 1850 to 1996, but a complete cross-section of 20
exchange rates does not exist before 1892, the starting date of the Swiss series.2
2 In constructing the dataset I have relied on standard sources. After 1948 the series are taken from the IMF‚Äôs
International Financial Statistics on CD-ROM. The principal pre-1948 price sources are the statistical volumes
of Brian Mitchell. For the provision of electronically-compiled price and exchange rate data from these and
other sources I am grateful to Michael Bordo. An appendix containing the data and full documentation is
available from the author upon request.

Given these data, some preliminary transformations and tests were performed. Let
the U.S. dollar-denominated price level of country i at time t be denoted by Rit =
Pit /E it , with rit = log Rit = pit ‚àí eit . As an initial step, missing data were filled in
for each series. In all cases, this amounted to imputing a value to a few wartime years
for certain countries, using linear interpolation on rit . This yields a balanced 20 √ó 105
panel of data from 1892 to 1996.
Such an interpolation procedure may be ad hoc, but it was deemed necessary to
give any stationarity test a fair chance on this data, since, in several cases, the missing
data appear after explosive inflations during which real exchange rate often depreciated.
Without interpolation in these periods, any subsequent reversion back toward the mean
(or trend) in this variable would be missed by any estimation procedure, and a bias
against stationarity would result. An important example would be the wide divergence
in real exchange rates in the 1930s following the collapse of the gold standard; this
episode was followed by war, leading to many missing observations in the data, and
thus much of the reversion of these divergent real exchange rates toward PPP during
and after the war would be omitted from the sample absent any interpolation.
With interpolations complete, the real exchange rate series was generated two ways:
first, relative to the U.S. dollar, as qit = rit ‚àí rUS,t ; and second, relativeto the ‚Äúworld‚Äù
1
3
(N = 20) basket of currencies, as qitW = rit ‚àí ritW , where ritW = N‚àí1
j =i r j t . The
second definition follows O‚ÄôConnell (1996), and may help us avoid problems associated
with the choice of the United States as a base country.4
The complete series qit and qitW for all 20 countries are shown in Figure 1. One
way to test the PPP hypothesis is to ask: are these real exchange rates stationary, that is,
mean-reverting? A cursory inspection suggests that for many countries real exchange
rates have been fairly stable over the long run, and we might expect to easily support the
hypothesis of stationarity. Nonetheless, our eyes are drawn to certain cases where there
appears to be a long-run trend or random walk. Here, the most obvious and well-known
problem would be the case of Japan, but similar symptoms of drift or nonstationarity
might also be perceived for Switzerland, Brazil, and in some other countries‚Äô experience
in specific periods, such as interwar Germany and Italy. Clearly, a powerful statistical
test will be needed to resolve this question.
We can begin analysis using more traditional unit root tests. Table 1 shows the
results of applying the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root tests to the univariate
real exchange rate series, and the results are expected given the findings in the previous
literature.5 In many cases, the unit root null cannot be rejected. Even allowing a trend
to be present does not seem to help very much, and the null is not rejected in most cases.
However, a simple OLS regression on a constant and a trend seems to indicate that, for
at least some of the series, a deterministic trend might be present; this trend component
is a sizeable 1.5% per annum in the case of Japan, 0.74% per annum for Switzerland,
3 Ideally, one might prefer to use trade-weighted real exchange rates, but such data do not exist in the form
of annual time series for the entire twentieth century for a wide sample of countries. Future research would
need to be directed to original sources to collate the necessary bilateral trade volumes, and this would be a
significant undertaking.
4 This discussion was omitted in O‚ÄôConnell (1998).
5 Lag lengths in the ADF tests were chosen by the Lagrange Multiplier (LM) criterion for residual serial
correlation, allowing up to a maximum of 6 lags.

but is small (no more than half a percent per year) in all other cases. All in all, we are
left with the conclusion that although some of the series may be I (1), many are I (0)
and most, in addition, have some deterministic drift. This impression is given whether
one uses the U.S as a base country, or one measures real exchange rates relative to the
‚Äúworld‚Äù basket.
One traditional response to such findings has always been to fault these tests for
their lack of power, and to point to the fact that, with slow convergence speeds, the
autoregressive parameter might be very close to unity, and one would need a very long
span of data to reject the null (Frankel 1990). With over a century of data, we might just
have sufficient span to have a reasonably powerful test, but we are still unable to find
broad evidence of stationarity. The recent literature suggests two possible directions:
the use of multivariate or panel methods, and the use of more efficient univariate tests.
We pursue both routes, to see which, if any, might lend support to the PPP hypothesis.

A Multivariate Test
If PPP holds among a set of N + 1 countries, this would imply that every single log real
exchange rate, for all N(N + 1)/2 bilateral pairs, would be stationary. One axiomatic
property of well-defined PPP measures is base country invariance. That is, the concept
of PPP must be invariant to the choice of base country. Thus we may, without loss of
generality, take a particular choice of a base country, and then consider the N bilateral
log rates relative to that country.6
An elegant test for the stationarity of these, and hence all, log rates was proposed
by M. P. Taylor and Sarno (1998). They note that a necessary and sufficient condition
that all N series be stationary would be the existence of N independent cointegrating
vectors among the series (Engle and Granger 1987). Conversely, if one takes the null
to be the absence of such a condition, that is, the existence of any nonstationary real
exchange rates, the null would correspond to a situation where the N series had fewer
than N cointegrating vectors.
These hypotheses permit some simple tests based on the cointegration methods of
Johansen (1988, 1991). To briefly review this approach, let qt = (q1t , . . . , q Nt ) be
the N √ó 1 vector of real exchange rates at time t. Under the PPP hypothesis, all N
components of q are I (0). The error-correction representation for the dynamics of q is
qt =  1 qt ‚àí1 + . . .  k‚àí1 qt ‚àík+1 +  k qt ‚àík + ¬µ + œât .
The N √ó N matrix  k has rank equal to the number of cointegrating vectors, so the
null hypothesis of one or more nonstationary series is: H0 : rank( k ) < N, and the
alternative hypothesis where all series are stationary is: H1 : rank( k ) = N. Since
full rank of  k would imply that all of the eigenvalues are nonzero, a test of H1 against
a null of H0 amounts to a test of the restriction that the smallest eigenvalue Œª N of the
estimated  k matrix is zero. The Johansen likelihood ratio test statistic for this case is
JLR = ‚àíT ln(1 ‚àí Œª N ) where JLR has an asymptotic distribution that is œá 2 (1).
6 All log real exchange rates between bilateral pairs can then be derived, assuming arbitrage amongst all
cross-rates in the exchange market, as linear combinations of the set of N log rates for the given base country.

Notes and Sources: See text and appendix. JLR is the Johansen Likelihood Ratio test statistic. The finitesample significance level is based on SIM simulations estimated under the assumptions of the null. The
power of the 5% test is based on 4, 096 simulations estimated under the assumptions of the alternative.

The chief merit of this test may be the clean specification of null and alternative
hypotheses. Other mutlivariate tests based on panel methods, such as the multivariate
form of the ADF test, may reject a unit root null when only some of the series are
stationary, but not all N.7 A multivariate approach also places further restrictions on
any empirical framework. Given the base-country-invariance postulate, the structure
imposes k lags of the qt in all equations of the system. Such a restriction is commonly
not a feature of univariate tests of PPP using single-country exchange rate series, yet it
ought to be present if we are really thinking in terms of a joint hypothesis test involving
the stationarity of all the series taken together. But what lag choice should one make?
In the previous section, the tests performed in Table 1 report a variety of lag lengths
selected by the Lagrange Multiplier criterion. By inspection, we note that, the maximal
lag length is two, so I chose k = 2 lags for the JLR test, as the minimal lag length that
should eliminate serial correlation from all univariate series.
The results of applying the Taylor-Sarno JLR test are shown in Table 2, with finitesample significance levels and power calculations. The results shown are those for the
real exchange rate relative to a ‚Äúworld‚Äù base, but the results using the U.S. as a base
country are similar and are omitted to save space. The width of the panel is potentially
a problem here: we have N = 20 where M. P. Taylor and Sarno had N = 4. Empirical
implementation would be inefficient, clumsy, and costly if I attempted to estimate a
20-equation VAR for the dynamic equation, so I elected to work with four subsets with
between four and six countries in each.8
7 Other tests may suffer from a ‚Äúmissing middle‚Äù ‚Äî the null is that all N series are I (1), but the alternative
of interest is that all N series are I (0). This structure fails to recognize that there are many intermediate
cases, where some series are stationary and some are not. This seems particularly relevant to our empirical
task, since the data in Figure 1 and the preliminary data analysis in Table 1 suggest that we might well have
such intermediate cases.
8 I thank a referee for suggesting this partitioning approach. Finite-sample significance levels and power
are derived by simulation. In simulations with N ‚â§ 6 series there are 2 N ‚àí 1 combinations of I (1) and
I (0) series that satisfy the null, and only one, with every series I (0), that satisfies the alternative. I ran
212 = 4, 096 simulations on each test, with each null combination simulated 212‚àíN times.

The JLR tests are somewhat favorable to the PPP hypothesis for most countries,
but only when allowance is made for a trend. In the cases with trend, stationarity is
accepted at a better than 10% significance level, except for the case of Norway which
just breaks that significance threshold. As expected, the power of test is low and it falls
dramatically when a trend is included. This reflects a common problem in the literature,
namely the low power of tests to detect trend stationarity in favor of a unit root null. In
the tests without a trend, stationarity is rarely accepted, except for Denmark, Finland,
Sweden, Australia and Canada, just 5 countries out of 20. The results suggest that the
JLR tests, in this particular sample, suffer from the weak power problem identified by
M. P. Taylor and Sarno. Accordingly, we might shift attention to a univariate approach
that uses the most efficient tests possible and is flexible enough to handle slowly-evolving
deterministic components.

A Univariate Test
The most powerful univariate unit root tests available at present are the generalizedleast-squares (GLS) versions of the Dickey-Fuller (DF) test due to Elliott, Rothenberg,
and Stock (1996). The tests are of broad applicability since they apply to cases where
the series have: (i) no trend; (ii) a deterministic constant term dt = (1); and (iii) a
deterministic constant term and drift dt = (1, t). We are, as always, working with
index numbers in PPP tests, and we also might want to allow for possible deterministic
trends in the spirit of Balassa-Samuelson, so the DF-GLS test is very relevant.
In the DF-GLS test, the series z t to be tested is replaced in the ADF regression by
zÀút = z t ‚àí Œ≤ÃÇ dt , where Œ≤ÃÇ is a GLS estimate of the coefficients on the deterministic trends
dt . That the DF-GLS test dominates others is shown via a local-to-unity asymptotic
approach, and the power envelope is close to the frontier. The unit-root PPP controversy
hangs on being able to pin down an autoregressive parameter œÅ that is less than, but
often very close to, unity. Hence, the DF-GLS test is an ideal tool for PPP testing.9
Table 3 shows the results of applying the DF-GLS tests to our real exchange rate
data. The format repeats that of Table 1. Four cases are considered: using the U.S.
and the ‚Äúworld‚Äù basket as a base; and using the series demeaned and detrended. These
results offer powerful support for the PPP hypothesis in the twentieth century. In all
cases without detrending the null of a unit root is rejected, and in most cases even with
a trend, though the test is less powerful there. Hence, with some allowance for the
possibility of slowly-evolving long-run trends, I conclude that PPP has held in the long
run over the twentieth century for my sample of 20 countries.10
If PPP holds in the long run, it is no longer productive to devote further attention to
the stationarity question. The more important and interesting problem is to explain what
drives the short-run dynamics of real exchange rates.11 That is, how do we account for
the amplitude and persistence of deviations from PPP, in different time periods and in
different countries in the last century?
9 The DF-GLS test gives support for PPP in the post-Bretton Woods era (Cheung and Lai 1998).
10 It would be desirable to follow up this study in the future with tests based on higher-frequency data. Still,

that we can find evidence in favor of PPP with annual series is very encouraging indeed, given the biases
introduced by temporal averaging in historical data (Taylor 2001).
11 The same conclusion was reached by Higgins and Zakraj≈°ek (1999).

criterion. Demeaned is the case where each series is replaced by the residuals from a regression on a

values corresponding to these significance levels are (‚àí1.62, ‚àí1.95, ‚àí2.58) for the demeaned series and
(‚àí2.57, ‚àí2.89, ‚àí3.48) for the detrended series, respectively. See Elliott, Rothenberg, and Stock (1996).

An Overview of PPP in the Twentieth Century
In this section, given the earlier findings, deviations from PPP will be measured relative
to the equilibrium real exchange rate. As we have seen, it is necessary to allow for
slowly-evolving deterministic trends. As an empirical matter, they are usually found
to be ‚Äúsmall.‚Äù However, their omission would undoubtedly upset any study of the
deviations of real exchange rates over the very long run.12 Accordingly, I will, for the
remainder of this paper, consider the dynamics of detrended real exchange rates in an
attempt to measure the reversion speed toward equilibrium.
The first question to ask is: what have been the extent of deviations from PPP over
the long run? One way to answer this question is to examine volatility via the size
of changes in the real exchange rate qit , since, according a mean-reversion theory,
this change would be proportional to the deviation from equilibrium plus some error.
Another approach would be to detrend the series qit and examine the deviations of
the resulting detrended level qit , that is, the error-correction term. For a cross section
of countries, the extent of these deviations at a given time t can be measured by the
standard deviations œÉ (qit ) and œÉ (qit ). Figure 2 shows these measures for our entire
sample and both exhibit similar trends.
12 A trend of, say, 0.5% per annum might make little difference over a one to ten year horizon, but over one
hundred years, if such a correction were left out, then log deviations from equilibrium could be mismeasured
by an additive shift of 0.5, or in levels by a multiplicative shift of 65%.

Real exchange rate deviations and volatility were relatively small prior to 1914 under
the classical gold standard regime, as expected. The interwar period was a major turning
point; deviations became much larger as many exchange rates began to float or stay fixed
for only a few years. There was some reduction in deviations after 1945, notably during
the heyday of Bretton Woods during the 1960s. Once the floating rate era began in the
1970s, deviations and volatility once again rose. This chronology offers some prima
facie reasons to view changes in the exchange rate regime as a major determinant of
real exchange rate behavior, an idea we will keep in mind.
Although we can now see from the data where and when deviations have been large
or small, we would like to know why they were large or small at particular times. In
an autoregressive model, any changes in the properties of the deviations can only be
attributed to two essential causes: either the dynamic process is subject to (stochastic)
shocks of different amplitude; or else the process itself exhibits different patterns of
(deterministic) persistence. To investigate this more fully, then, we need to apply and
estimate a model. Given that we are taking trend stationarity as given, based on earlier
findings, Table 4 reports the results of fitting an error-correction model to the detrended
U.S.-based real exchange rate qit , with a specification
qit = Œ≤0 qit + Œ≤1 qi,t ‚àí1 + Œ≤2 qi,t ‚àí2 + t .
The coefficients Œ≤1 and Œ≤2 are not reported; columns labeled i and t indicate the samples,
including pooled samples(P) across both countries and time periods; periods correspond
to the exchange rate regimes, Gold Standard (G), Interwar (I), Bretton Woods (B), and
Float (F); halflives in years are reported (H ); and significance levels are reported for
tests of pooling across periods (p1) and countries (p2).13
13 The lag choice k = 2 was sufficient based on LM tests in all cases except the cross-country pooled
samples. A uniform lag structure was imposed to facilitate pooling tests.

Note that these results are often for very short spans of data, so that we are not using
the coefficient Œ≤0 as a basis for a stationarity test. Rather, we now have a maintained
hypothesis of long run trend stationarity based on the earlier tests. The pooling restrictions are not always rejected, but sufficiently often that is seems safest to treat this as a
heterogeneous panel, and examine the nature of the dynamics in different periods and
countries. This is pursued in Table 5, by focusing on the two key features‚Äîone random,
one not‚Äîthat generate PPP deviations: the halflife of disturbances, calculated from the
estimated model via (deterministic) forecast; and the variance of the (stochastic) error
disturbances SEE = œÉ .14
The striking aspect of these results are the relatively small variations in halflives
across the four exchange-rate regimes. There are notable exceptions. One is Italy in the
interwar period, where the estimated root is explosive on this restricted sample; also,
interwar Germany has slow reversion which may not be surprising given the aftermath
of hyperinflation in the 1920s and the extensive controls on the economy in the 1930s
(see Figure 1).15 Still, all the other halflives in the table are in the low single digits as
14 For a simple motivation of this rough division of sources of deviations, consider an AR(1) process for the
real exchange rate, qt = œÅqt‚àí1 + t . The unconditional variance of qt is Var(q) = œÉ2 /(1 ‚àí œÅ 2 ). The halflife
is a simple function if the autoregressive parameter, H = ln 0.5/ ln œÅ. Thus, the numerator of Var(q) is a
function of the size of the (stochastic) shocks, and the denominator a function of the (deterministic) halflife.
With higher order processes the separation is not so clean, but the intuition is the same.
15 Tests for PPP in the 1930s for Britain, U.S., France and Germany were undertaken by Broadberry and
M. P. Taylor (1988). Consistent with the present interpretation, they found PPP except for bilateral exchange
rates involving the mark, a result attributed to the extensive controls in the German economy.

measured in years. The mean and median halflives hover around two to three years,
a timeframe even more favorable to rapid PPP adjustment than most recent empirical
studies. The variation in halflives around the mean or median is small, around one or two
years in most cases. There is evidence of only a modest decline in halflives after World
War Two, with a drop from 3.5 years to 2.5 on average, a decline of about one third. In
sum, we have found a new, quite provocative, and remarkable result. Looking across
the twentieth century, and despite considerable differences in institutional arrangements
and market integration across time and across countries, the deterministic aspects of
persistence of PPP deviations have been fairly uniform in the international economy.16
What, then, accounts for the dramatic changes in deviations from PPP during the
twentieth century seen in Figure 2? As one might guess, it is the stochastic components
that have to do most of the work to account for this given the fairly flat halflife measures.
Under the gold standard we find SEE = .05 on average, that is, a 5% standard deviation
for the stochastic shocks. This rises by a factor of three to 14% on average in the interwar,
then falls by a third to 10% under Bretton Woods, before climbing by over one-half to
16% under the float. Of course, there are some notable outliers here, such as the Latin
American economies that experience hyperinflation in the postwar period. We should
also note that, due to lack of accurate, synchronized data, the German hyperinflation of
the early 1920s is omitted from the data in this study, and is covered by interpolation.
To reinforce the point, Figure 3 shows a scatterplot of œÉ (qt ) versus œÉ for the AR
model fitted to each country during each regime. Given the model is linear, we may
write œÉ (qt ) = f (œÅ j )œÉ where the ratio f is a function of all the AR coefficients œÅ j .
With no persistence f = 1, and more persistence causes an increase in f > 1. What
is noteworthy here is how f has been uniform and almost constant over the twentieth
century. The correlation of œÉ (qt ) and œÉ has been 0.99 across all regimes. From the
regression we see that a forecast of œÉ (qt ) assuming f = 1.1 yields an R 2 of 0.9 and a
tiny standard error of 0.01. As we surmised, the persistence of the processes has played
little role here little, and changes in the stochastic shocks explain virtually all changes
in the volatility in the real exchange rate across space and time.
The error disturbances tell a consistent story, revealing much larger shocks to the real
exchange rate process under floating-rate regimes than under fixed-rate regimes. This
result has been observed in contemporary data, but this study is the most comprehensive
long-run analysis, based on more than a century of data for a broad sample of countries.
Of particular historical note is the emergence of the interwar period as an important
turning point, an era when PPP deviations shifted to dramatically higher levels.17 Given
the vast changes in institutions and market structure over a hundred years or more, the
relationship of real exchange rate deviations to the monetary regime now looks like a
robust stylized historical fact.
A final piece of evidence reinforces this notion. One approach to explaining real
exchange rate deviations in cross section has been to try to disengage the effects of
16 Another study that examines reversion to PPP across different monetary regimes is Parsley and Popper
(1999). They focus only on postwar data for the period 1961‚Äì92 in 82 countries, but this encompasses a wide
range of exchange rate arrangements. They find only slightly faster reversion under the dollar peg, about 12%
per year, versus pure floating, at 10% per year. This is consistent with the findings in this paper.
17 On the interwar period as a turning point see Obstfeld and A. M. Taylor (1998; 2001). Interwar studies
of PPP find results consistent with these findings (Eichengreen 1988; M. P. Taylor and McMahon (1988).

geography and currencies. Engel and Rogers (1996, 1998, 1999) have shown that
although ‚Äúborder effects‚Äù do matter, a very large share of deviations from parity across
countries is accounted for by the effect of currencies, that is, by nominal exchange
rate volatility.18 We can follow a similar tack here, by looking at the sample variances
for our four regimes and for each of the twenty countries. Of course, unlike Engel
and Rogers we cannot make within country comparisons, but we do have a somewhat
more controlled experiment: using an historical sample, as opposed to the post-Bretton
Woods era, we do obtain much greater sample variation in exchange rate volatility, even
as ‚Äúgeography‚Äù‚Äîneedless to say‚Äîhas remained constant.
Table 6 tabulates real and nominal exchange rate volatility in the various subsamples. Under the gold standard we see low real and nominal volatility among those
countries that clung hard to the rules of the game (those with zero nominal volatility); but for other countries, as the nominal volatility rose, so did the real volatility
(examine, for example, Japan and Switzerland, then Mexico, Portugal and Spain, and
finally Brazil and Argentina). Overall the cross country correlation is 0.74. Under the
mostly-floating interwar period a similar story can be told, although many more real
shocks were present in the form of terms-of-trade disturbances and financial crises, so
it is perhaps not surprising to see the correlation fall to 0.52. Another reason that the
correlations might be somewhat less than one in the early twentieth century is that price

‚Äúborder‚Äù dummy (equal to one when the locations are in different countries). Within Europe, for the 1980s
and 1990s, they find there is an almost one-to-one pass through from œÉ (eit ) to œÉ (qit ) (the coefficient is
0.92), and an inspection of the summary statistics for each is sufficient to convey the message (Engel and
Rogers 1999, Tables 2 and 3A).

flexibility was almost certainly higher in this earlier epoch, a result noted in international
studies of business-cycle fluctuations.19 In the postwar period the correlation is very
strong, 0.99 under Bretton Woods and 0.94 under the float for our sample. In the float,
Brazil and Argentina pose problems for the correlation because of their hyperinflation
experiences‚Äîepisodes when, again, large price adjustments went in tandem with nominal exchange rate movements. The correlation for the twenty countries over all regimes
is 0.87, and the message I take from these results is that the dominant source of PPP
failure is nominal exchange rate volatility, that is, the nature of the monetary regime.20
Finally, we might ask, why was this pattern of real and nominal exchange rate
volatility observed in twentieth century history, and what implications should this have
for our research? The empirical measures shown here appear very consistent with
historical changes in monetary regimes, the associated record of institutional changes,
and the tools from the political-economy nexus that have been invoked to explain them.
The widely accepted account of these major regime shifts relies on what Obstfeld and
19 See the survey of these issues in Basu and A. M. Taylor (1999).
20 Do all international relative prices move up and down together as per the aggregate real exchange

rate movement, or do they show different patterns that are less well correlated with nominal exchange rate
volatility? Absent detailed disaggregated data, we cannot show, like Engel and Rogers did (1995, 1996), how
much of these PPP deviations are common to all goods‚Äô relative prices as a source of deviations from the
law of one price (LOOP). This would be an excellent topic for future research. However, unless contradicted
by an array of large and offsetting LOOP deviations for various goods that virtually cancel out‚Äîan unlikely
outcome‚Äîthe patterns thus far are entirely consistent with the view that deviations from LOOP are similarly
traceable to deviations from aggregate PPP, which, in turn, are in large part determined by the nature of
monetary shocks, rather than barriers to trade or geography.

16

A. M. Taylor (1998, 2001) term the macroeconomic policy trilemma. This trilemma is
the well-known conflict facing policymakers when choosing between three competing
objectives, (i) a fixed exchange rate, (ii) capital mobility, and (iii) activist monetary
policy, where only two out of three are feasible. Under this schema, the gold standard
saw countries forsake monetary policy (iii). The interwar was a period when either
controls, sacrificing (ii), or devaluations, sacrificing (i), were employed. Bretton Woods
was a system of limited capital mobility, entailing the loss of (ii). The float brought
back capital mobility at the expense of fixed rates sacrificing (i). Several measures of
capital mobility in the twentieth century accord with the trilemma view of history, and
historical accounts paint a similar picture once we examine institutional change and the
actions of policymakers more closely (Eichengreen 1996).
The tight relationship between monetary volatility and real exchange rate volatility
sustains doubts about meaningful macroeconomic models that impose short-run money
neutrality. In the long run PPP holds, and so money appears to be neutral at that horizon;
but the fact that short-run PPP deviations may be large, and seem very closely associated
with monetary shocks, suggests a role for nominal rigidities. Since the real exchange rate
is a combination of price levels and exchange rates, another way to restate the conclusion
is that inflation volatility and nominal exchange rate volatility‚Äîeach one a monetary
phenomenon in itself‚Äîare jointly nonneutral in the sense that they are correlated with
a real effect, the size deviations from PPP (as noted by Cheung and Lai 2000). The
above correlations would then be consistent with a view that nominal exchange rates
can adjust very quickly even as other prices in the economy move more sluggishly,
an assumption common to many international macroeconomic models of older and
newer vintages (Dornbusch 1976; Obstfeld and Rogoff 1996). Further study will be
needed to incorporate these dynamics into an econometric PPP model and measure them
in historical (and contemporary) samples, but it does seem that monetary time series
would be extremely important as an explanatory variable, despite their considerable
endogeneity problems. In short we leave this study with the strong suspicion that for
the most part, to coin a phrase, deviations from PPP are always and everywhere a
monetary phenomenon.
