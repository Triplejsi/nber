Introduction
In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in public commitment to health

insurance coverage for children. Beginning in the mid-1980s, a series of federal laws uncoupled
Medicaid eligibility from eligibility for cash assistance (then Aid to Families with Dependent
Children, or AFDC), substantially expanding the population eligible for Medicaid. Because
AFDC eligibility depended partly on family structure and because the program’s income
threshold in most states was well below the federal poverty line, the tie to AFDC meant that
previously Medicaid had covered less than half the families with incomes below the poverty line.
The expansions raised the eligibility threshold from the AFDC level to at least 100 percent of the
poverty line and possibly higher, depending on the age of the child. Following the federal
expansions, many states expanded their Medicaid programs further to include children not
covered by the federal mandates. In addition, in response to pressure from states and a
continuing decline in private insurance coverage for children, in the summer of 1997 Congress
and the President enacted a law creating the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
which provides states with $40 billion over the next ten years in block grant funding (the largest
increase in public spending on insurance for children in three decades) to expand further
publicly-provided health insurance for children.
These expansions in public health insurance for children have led to two potentially
contradictory concerns for public policy. On the one hand, policy makers have been concerned
that the availability of public insurance may lead families to decline private insurance for
children in favor of public coverage ("crowding out"). This may occur if the cost of public
insurance for an eligible child is less for the family than the cost of employer-sponsored health
1

insurance, or if employers change their dependent health insurance provisions in response to the
expansions. On the other hand, recent research (Selden, Banthin, and Cohen 1998) has found
that over 20 percent of all Medicaid-eligible children still do not have health insurance, with
most of these children being eligible under Medicaid expansion programs. While lack of health
insurance may not seem to be an important issue when children who need care can receive it in
emergency room settings, research has shown that children who do not have health insurance
often do not get preventive care (see for example Marquis and Long 1994, Currie and Gruber
1996, and McNeil 1995).
In this paper, we use panel data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation
(SIPP), to examine how the Medicaid expansions affected insurance coverage. Specifically, we
estimate static and dynamic discrete panel data models of public and private insurance
participation. We first estimate static models of the effect of being eligible for Medicaid on
private insurance coverage (crowding out) and the effect on public insurance enrollment (takeup) that are identical to the models estimated previously in cross-sectional data. As our results
differ substantially from those of studies using the Current Population Survey, we explore
various reasons for these differences.
We then utilize the panel nature of the data to extend the cross section models. Panel
data in general, and the SIPP in particular, offer several advantages for studying the effect of
expanded public coverage. Such data allow us to observe directly and to analyze patterns in a
given child’s insurance coverage over time, particularly how these patterns change following an
expansion in public health insurance. We first extend the cross section models by allowing the
effect of eligibility for children who are newly eligible to differ from the effect for children who
2

have been eligible for a period of time, since an eligible child may not be enrolled immediately in
Medicaid. Second, panel data allow us to account for unobservable individual-specific factors
that may be correlated with the variables of interest in our analysis. Such factors may include the
unobserved health endowment of the child, the child’s parents’ taste for work, or other tastes. To
control for such factors we estimate models including individual fixed effects. Finally, we
estimate simple dynamic models of insurance participation which allow the short-run and longrun effects of eligibility to differ. These models allow us to address the possibility that whether a
person has insurance at a given time depends on that person’s insurance coverage in a previous
period. Thus by exploiting the panel nature of the SIPP, we are able to relax several of the
assumptions commonly made in past research.
The SIPP offers several additional advantages for studying Medicaid participation,
particularly tri-annual rather than annual data collection and more detailed income data.
Observing variables such as income and insurance on a monthly basis allows us to correlate
changes in these variables both with changes in Medicaid eligibility rules and with other timechanging variables. In addition, the detailed monthly information available in the SIPP allows us
to determine eligibility with a smaller degree of error than is possible with annual data.
We find little evidence in the SIPP of a negative relationship between eligibility for
Medicaid and private coverage in static models estimated using standard techniques. However
we do find that children who became eligible under the expansions are more likely to be enrolled
in Medicaid, a relationship that is somewhat weaker than that found in previous research.
Examining the differences between the SIPP results and previous results using the CPS, we find
that the difference in the private coverage results does not appear to be due to different samples,
3

attrition, or the annual nature of the CPS data collection. Including fixed effects to allow for
permanent unobserved characteristics of the child and family reduces the magnitude of the
estimated take-up effect, while the fixed effects estimates for the private insurance regression
become negative and marginally statistically significant in some specifications. However while
we find that persistence is an important feature of insurance status in the SIPP, we again do not
find evidence of crowding out using dynamic linear regression models. We find that the
immediate impact estimates from the dynamic models are smaller than the effects estimated from
the static models, but the estimates of the long run impact of eligibility from the dynamic models
are somewhat larger.

Background

A.

Expansions in Public Health Insurance
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program financed by state contributions and federal

matching funds.1 Program participants fall into three groups: low-income aged and disabled
people; the “medically needy” (people who have recently incurred large medical expenses); and
low-income families with dependent children. Members of the third group were the main focus
of the legislative changes, and in this paper we concentrate exclusively on them. Historically,
this group was comprised of families receiving cash assistance through the AFDC program.
Thus, Medicaid eligibility and participation were directly linked to the eligibility standards for

See U.S. Committee on Ways and Means (1984-1993), Congressional Research Service (1988,
1993), Health Care Financing Administration (1988, 1990), and National Governors' Association Center
for Policy Research (1988-1996) for more detailed descriptions of the Medicaid program and the
expansions.

AFDC. Generally, to qualify for AFDC a family must have had either a single parent or an
unemployed primary earner. The family’s income and resources also had to be less than stateestablished standards, most of which were well below the federal poverty line.
Starting in the mid-1980s, a series of federal law changes substantially diminished the
link between Medicaid eligibility and AFDC eligibility by relaxing the restrictions on two-parent
families and those with earned income, extending Medicaid coverage to families with incomes
above the AFDC thresholds.2 Beginning with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts (OBRA)
of 1986 and 1987, Congress gave states the authority to raise the income limits for Medicaid
coverage of certain groups (such as infants and very young children) above the AFDC level.
Congressionally mandated increases in state eligibility limits followed, most notably with the
passage of OBRA 1989 and OBRA 1990. OBRA 1989 required coverage of pregnant women
and children up to age 6 with family incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, and
OBRA 1990 required states to cover children born after September 30, 1983 with family incomes
below 100 percent of the federal poverty level. Further expansions (within certain guidelines for
age and family income) were permitted at state option. In total, the expansions raised the
eligibility threshold from the AFDC level to at least 100 percent of the poverty line and possibly
higher, depending on age and state of residence. Age plays a role because eligibility standards
for younger children were generally less restrictive, while state of residence is important because
states had the option of exceeding the federal minimum eligibility limits.

2

Prior to the expansions studied here, there had been minor expansions in Medicaid eligibility
(such as the Ribicoff program) which allowed states (at their option) to cover children or pregnant
women who met AFDC income standards but did not qualify due to family structure. The Deficit
Reduction Act (DEFRA) of 1984 began the process of expanding eligibility by requiring states to cover
children who lived in families that were income-eligible for AFDC, regardless of family structure.

Previous Literature
There have been a number of studies examining the impact of the Medicaid expansions

on insurance coverage, particularly focusing on the question of whether and to what extent the
expansions caused individuals to shift from private coverage to public coverage. Most research
in this area has used cross-sectional data, although a few papers have used panel data. The
largest estimate of substitution between private and public insurance comes from Cutler and
Gruber (1996). Using the expansions as a source of exogenous variation in eligibility, they use
Current Population Survey (CPS) data from 1988 to 1993 to examine the cross-sectional
relationship between eligibility for Medicaid and private coverage. They find a negative
relationship between eligibility and private coverage and conclude that roughly half of the
increase in Medicaid coverage due to the expansions was associated with a reduction in private
insurance. Dubay and Kenney (1996) use data from the March 1989 and 1994 CPS and compare
the change in private coverage for children to the change in private coverage for men, who were
theoretically unaffected by the expansion of Medicaid (although in the data reported Medicaid
coverage for men did rise over this period). They conclude that the increase in Medicaid
eligibility led to a reduction in private coverage beyond what would have occurred in the absence
of the expansions. Their estimate of the extent of substitution is that between 15 and 22 percent
of total enrollment in Medicaid over this period came from private insurance (a different measure
than that used by Cutler and Gruber 1996). Shore-Sheppard (1997) also uses data from the CPS,
for the years 1988 to 1996, to estimate the impact of the expansions on coverage of the newly
eligible children. She finds that state-age-income cells with larger fractions of newly eligible
children experienced a larger loss of private coverage. In addition, she finds that children who
6

were eligible at the beginning of the period experienced a more extensive loss of private
coverage than children who became eligible during the later expansions. Her estimates of the
extent of substitution range from 15 to 33 percent for children for the 1988-1993 CPS (depending
on the source of variation) and from 31 to 57 percent when the time period is extended to the
1996 CPS.
Three more recent studies use longitudinal data to examine insurance substitution:
Blumberg, Dubay, and Norton (2000) use data from the 1990 SIPP, while Yazici and Kaestner
(1998) and Thorpe and Florence (1998) use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
(NLSY). Blumberg, Dubay, and Norton (2000) compare the change in insurance status for
children who became eligible between the first and last interviews of the SIPP panel with the
change for children who remained ineligible due to their age, controlling for characteristics of the
children as of the first interview. Their estimate of the extent of substitution of public for private
coverage is 23 percent for children who already had private coverage and 0 percent for children
who began the panel uninsured. Although their focus is on displacement of private coverage by
public coverage, in the process of examining displacement they estimate the probability that a
child who is uninsured in the first interview is uninsured at the last interview. They find that this
probability decreased among children whose age made them possibly affected by the expansions.
Yazici and Kaestner (1998) compare changes in public and private coverage rates
between 1988 and 1992 for children who became eligible and those who did not, distinguishing
between eligibility onset based on income loss and eligibility onset due to the expansions. Their
estimates of the percent of Medicaid enrollment that came from private insurance range from 5
percent to 37 percent, depending on the groups of children considered; however the study design
7

does not account for the possible endogeneity of selection into the comparison group. Finally,
Thorpe and Florence (1998) perform a descriptive analysis and find that most children who had
private insurance coverage in one year and Medicaid in the following year have parents who both
lost private coverage and were unemployed in that year. Assuming that parents do not drop their
own coverage when their child becomes Medicaid-eligible (an assumption contrary to the
findings of Cutler and Gruber 1996), they measure crowding out as the fraction of children who
move from private coverage to Medicaid but whose parents retain private coverage. Using this
measure, they find that between 2 and 23 percent of previously privately insured children who
enrolled in Medicaid had parents who retained private coverage, depending on the year
considered and the income level of the family.
The NLSY data present a problem not encountered in the CPS or SIPP: the NLSY is
composed of one particular cohort of mothers who are aging over the time period of the
expansions, and thus trends in insurance coverage for children in the NLSY are different from the
trends in the general population. Insurance coverage rates among children in the NLSY
increased over this time period, while insurance coverage in the population of children more
generally was declining. Consequently, estimated effects of the expansions from the NLSY may
not be generalizable to the entire population of children. In addition, the authors of the NLSY
studies restrict their samples by age, income, or insurance status. These restrictions yield quite
small sample sizes from which the authors draw their conclusions.

III.

Econometric Approach
To examine the effects of the Medicaid expansions using the SIPP, we first consider

static models of insurance coverage using a random effects framework. This framework allows
us to use the same specification for the SIPP that has been used by previous researchers for the
CPS. Next we exploit the fact that we have panel data to allow the effect of eligibility to differ in
the first four months of eligibility and to estimate a fixed effects model. Finally, we consider
simple dynamic models of insurance coverage, using both a random effects framework and a
fixed effects framework.
A. Cross Section Static Models
Following the previous literature, we begin with a static model in which a family can
choose whether to obtain private insurance and/or public insurance for each child. One can think
of each choice having a utility associated with it (given the constraints facing the family), and the
family selecting the choice with the highest utility. This will lead to a model with two index
functions. The index functions in a given period t can be approximated as
(1)

k=p,s

where p denotes private and s denotes public insurance. The vector Zkit contains various
characteristics of the child and the family, including the age, sex, and race of the child, the age
and education of the highest earner in the family, and the size and composition of the family. It
also contains a variable ELIGit, coded one if the child is eligible for Medicaid and zero otherwise,
which depends on family income as well as the age of the child, the state, the month and the year.

9

Year and state dummies are included in Zkit to pick up unobserved differences over time and
across states such as differences in the cost of private insurance and the difficulty of the
enrollment process for public insurance. Finally, Zkit includes the monthly unemployment rate in
the state, since this may affect the constraints facing the family. (The employment status of the
head is likely to affect the family's constraints, and the unemployment rates will affect the
employment status of the head.)
A child is assumed to have private insurance (Ipit = 1) if the index I*pit > 0 and to have
public insurance (Isit = 1) if I*sit > 0. (The child has no insurance if Ipit = 0 and Isit = 0.) This is
essentially the model estimated by Cutler and Gruber (1996) using CPS data. Cutler and Gruber
use a linear probability model and two-stage methods to estimate the equations
(2)

, k=p,s.

As they note, ELIGit is likely to be endogenous. There are several reasons for this endogeneity:
because parental wages and benefits such as health insurance are likely to be correlated (for
example, low-skill household heads may both receive low wages and be less likely to be offered
dependent health insurance coverage); because eligibility is a function of (potentially
unobserved) individual and family characteristics that may be correlated with the demand for
insurance; because a transitory shock such as a job loss affects both eligibility and coverage; and
because it may proxy family income if that variable is not included as a regressor, perhaps
because it too may be endogenous. However the Medicaid expansions provide a source of
exogenous variation in eligibility, since children of different ages and in different states are made
eligible while others remain ineligible. For example, at the end of 1991 the mandatory rules
meant that a child younger than 6 years old would be eligible if his or her family income was less
10

than 133 percent of the poverty line, children between ages 7 and 9 would be eligible if their
family incomes were less than 100 percent of the poverty line, and older children had to have
family incomes that met AFDC eligibility criteria. In addition, there were state-implemented
rules that expanded the income limits further for some children. To take advantage of this
variation, Cutler and Gruber create an instrument for ELIGit by drawing a random sample from
the entire CPS, imputing eligibility to the sample according to the rules in each state, and
calculating the fraction eligible of each state-year-age cell. This instrument, which is essentially
an index of the expansiveness of Medicaid eligibility for each age group in each state and year,
varies only with the legislative environment towards Medicaid for that state-year-age group and
is thus uncorrelated with the error in (1), assuming that state generosity in Medicaid eligibility
standards is not correlated with the availability or cost of private insurance in the state or the
level of state income.
We first estimate Cutler and Gruber’s model, calculating an instrument (FRACELIGit )
analogous to theirs that varies by state, month, year and age.3 This instrument is the fraction of
children of a given age (drawn randomly from the SIPP) who would be eligible in the given state,
month and year. In our second specification, we replace the endogenous variable ELIGit with the
exogenous variable AGEELIGit, which equals one if the child would be eligible based solely on
the age criteria in the federal and state expansions effective that month and year and zero
otherwise. (This variable is similar to that used by Blumberg, Dubay, and Norton 2000.) The

3

While other previous research has used alternative but similar instruments (see, for example,
Shore-Sheppard 1997,) the Cutler and Gruber instrument proved the most straightforward to implement
in the SIPP data. We correct the standard errors to allow for correlation across time for the same
individual.

11

advantage of using AGEELIGit is that we do not have to treat it as endogenous.4 However,
AGEELIGit may overstate or understate eligibility. On the one hand, it will include children
from families with incomes above the Medicaid cutoff for that state in that year. On the other
hand, it will not capture children who qualify only because the family is on AFDC. We follow
the literature and estimate both specifications using a linear probability model.5 (See Heckman
and MaCurdy 1985 for a detailed examination of the simultaneous equations linear probability
model.)6
Given that our specifications estimated from panel data closely resemble (by design)
those estimated from cross-section data, it is useful to consider the relative merits of using the
SIPP compared to using multiple cross-sections for different individuals from the CPS. The
major advantages of the CPS are that it is nationally representative, the sample size is large, and
it does not suffer from problems peculiar to panel data such as attrition. One advantage to using
panel data from the SIPP is an improvement in the imputation of a child's eligibility for
Medicaid, since the SIPP provides monthly income data rather than annual data and more
detailed information about the birth dates of the children. Another advantage of the SIPP relative
to the CPS is in using time-changing explanatory variables. The primary explanatory variable of

4

Again, we must assume that the availability or cost of private insurance (or income levels)
across states and time are uncorrelated with AGEELIGi,t.
5

While both FRACELIG and AGEELIG may be used as instrumental variables for ELIG, for
comparability with previous results we estimate the static models using only FRACELIG. We have
estimated the model using both instruments and find that using the second instrument makes little
differences in the results.
6

We also estimate the specification with AGEELIG using a probit model. The estimated
marginal effects from the probit model (available upon request) differ very little from the linear
probability model coefficients.
12

interest, Medicaid eligibility status (ELIG), is one such variable. Suppose that a child is
ineligible in the first half of a given year and is eligible in the second half of that year because of
a Medicaid expansion on July 1. Then in an analysis based on annual cross section data, it is not
clear whether the eligibility variable should be averaged over the year or whether Medicaid status
at the end of the year should be used. Finally, in the March CPS there is uncertainty about
whether individuals respond to the questions about health insurance coverage in the previous
year with information about their entire previous year’s coverage (as the question is posed) or
about their coverage at a particular point in time (as many respondents appear to do–see Swartz
1986 and Shore-Sheppard 1996 for discussions of this issue.) In addition, when the question is
answered as posed, an individual who had private insurance over the entire previous year and an
individual who had coverage just in a single month would be observationally equivalent in the
CPS. In the SIPP we are able to match insurance coverage, eligibility, and other variables
month-by-month.
B.

Panel Data Static Models
The approach described above ignores two primary advantage of using panel data. First,

one can allow the effect of eligibility to differ depending on how long the child has been eligible.
Specifically, parents may not be immediately aware of their child's eligibility, or they may not
enroll the child until the child needs medical care (for example, a child may be enrolled at a
hospital emergency room while being treated for an injury or illness). If this is the case, then one
would expect the effect of eligibility on insurance coverage to be smaller in the first few months
of eligibility. To allow for this possibility, we redefine Zkit to contain two endogenous variables:
a dummy variable indicating the first four months of eligibility and a dummy variable indicating
13

that an individual has been eligible for five or more consecutive months. We use as instruments
FRACELIGit, FRACELIGit-1, FRACELIGit-2, and FRACELIGit-3.
A second advantage of panel data is that such data allow one to do a better job of
controlling for differences in permanent unobserved characteristics (such as tastes or unobserved
permanent health status) across individuals. With panel data it is not necessary to assume that
the time-changing explanatory variables are independent of the individual-specific component of
the error term if one uses a fixed effects model. For example, parents may have different tastes
affecting the type of insurance available to their children, and these tastes may be correlated with
unobserved factors affecting Medicaid eligibility such as income. Intuitively, with panel data we
can control for these omitted taste components by comparing the same child’s insurance status
before and after a change in Medicaid eligibility. Thus the effect of eligibility is identified from
children for whom Medicaid entitlement changes over the sample period. Further, the use of
FRACELIG as an instrument and of AGEELIG as an explanatory variable in a cross section
assumes that a family's location choice is uncorrelated with permanent tastes for public or private
insurance, and a fixed effects model also allows us to relax this assumption.7
We should note that care needs to be taken in comparing estimates from a fixed effects model
and a standard cross section model.8 The fixed effect may effectively control for the lifetime marginal
utility of income, and thus by including it we would implicitly be assuming that a life-cycle model of

7

Another advantage of the fixed effect specification is that it may help control for panel
attrition—if an individual has a permanent propensity to leave the sample which may be correlated
with characteristics such as eligibility, it will be eliminated in this specification.
8

For example, Keane and Wolpin (1998) note the difference in interpretation between models
of the effect of benefits on welfare participation that do, and do not, condition on state dummies.
They find that this difference is important in their simulations.
14

insurance choice is appropriate. The model without fixed effects implicitly assumes that a model of
insurance participation conditional on a static (period by period) utility function and budget constraint is
appropriate. If we consider an increase in the probability of being eligible for Medicaid as being
equivalent to a decrease in the price of Medicaid insurance, the fixed effects estimate will capture only a
positive (Frisch) substitution effect, while the cross section estimates will capture a positive (Slutsky)
substitution effect as well as a positive income effect. (Here we are ignoring the fact that health
insurance is not a continuous consumption good.) Thus the fixed effects approach and the cross section
approach estimate different parameters and we would expect the response from the fixed effects model to
be smaller (see, e.g., Browning, Deaton and Irish 1985).9

Using a linear probability model, the extension to fixed effects estimation is
straightforward, and we first estimate the fixed effects model by taking deviations from the
individual means in (2). As a specification check on our results, we also estimate the fixed effect
model by first differencing (2) to obtain
(3)

, k=p,s,

where

kit

refers to the time-changing explanatory variables. If the two sets of fixed effects

estimates differ, this would suggest that the model is misspecified; in particular, such a difference
could indicate that a dynamic model may be more appropriate.
C. Dynamic Models
Panel data allow researchers to consider dynamic models of insurance determination.
One potential drawback of (1) is that it implicitly assumes that families make a new decision
9

Intuitively, think of the fixed effect controlling for lifetime income in a perfect foresight model.
Then ignoring the differences in the substitution effects, the estimates conditional on the fixed effect will
not have any income effect, while estimates based on a cross-section model will have a large income
effect associated with them.
15

each period about whether or not to obtain public or private insurance for their children, and that
this decision is independent of last period’s decision. Thus, it may be more appropriate to relax
this assumption and consider a model of choice conditional on the lagged insurance state. For
example, as noted above, insurance outcomes are closely related to job outcomes—families often
gain access to private insurance when members find a job, and can lose private insurance when
they are laid off. Since there is substantial persistence in labor market histories of disadvantaged
women (see, e.g., Chay and Hyslop 1998), if we do not control for labor market histories in
estimation, we would expect this persistence to carry over into insurance determination. Also,
(1) does not incorporate the notion of fixed costs: a family with a child on Medicaid has already
paid the fixed costs of enrolling the child and is more likely to have the child on Medicaid next
month.
The simplest dynamic model is obtained by adding a lagged dependent variable to (2)
(4)

, k=p,s,

where Ipit-1 (Isit-1) equals one if the individual had private (public) insurance last period and zero
otherwise. If we adopt a random effects specification for the overall error term, in the
specification with ELIG, we must consider both ELIG and the lagged dependent variable as
endogenous (see, e.g., Hsiao 1986). In this case we can use FRACELIGit, FRACELIGit-1,
AGEELIGit, AGEELIGit-1 and lags of the other explanatory variables as instruments. For the case
where AGEELIGit enters equation (4) instead of ELIGit, we can use FRACELIGit, FRACELIGit-1,
AGEELIGit-1 and lags of the other explanatory variables as instruments. Dynamic models allow
the effect of changes in Medicaid eligibility to increase over time, as opposed to assuming that
the entire effect occurs immediately. One can also estimate the long-run effect of eligibility by
16

dividing its coefficient by one minus the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable.
If we assume a fixed effect specification for the error in (4), we cannot simply use least
squares (Nickell 1981). Instead, the easiest way to proceed is to first-difference (4) and obtain
(5)

, k=p,s.

Even if we assume that Ikit is white noise (i.e., no autocorrelation conditional on the fixed effect),
we must treat (Ikit-1 -Ikit-2) as endogenous given the correlation between Ikit-1 and Ikit-1 (Hsiao 1986,
Arellano and Bond 1991). If we use FELIGit as an explanatory variable in (5), we must also treat
it as endogenous. Assuming that Ikit is indeed white noise, we can use lagged values of the
dependent value from period t-2 and earlier as instruments. If we do not assume that Ikit is white
noise, we again use FRACELIGit, FRACELIGit-1, AGEELIGit, AGEELIGit-1 and lags of the other
explanatory variables as instruments. The case where we use FAGEELIGit as an explanatory
variable in (5) instead of FELIGit proceeds in a similar fashion.

IV.

Data
As noted previously, the data used in the empirical analysis are from the Survey of

Income and Program Participation (SIPP), a series of longitudinal data sets collected for a
random sample of the U.S. population by the Census Bureau. The SIPP is collected in a series of
panels, each one containing approximately 17,000 households, on average. For ease of
interviewing, the entire sample is randomly split into four rotation groups, and one rotation group
is interviewed each month. Each rotation group in a SIPP panel is interviewed once every four
months about employment and program participation during the previous four months (termed a
wave). Each SIPP panel lasts approximately 32 months, although the length of the panel varies,
17

from 24 months for the 1988 panel to 40 months for the 1992 and 1993 panels. A new panel is
introduced each year, which yields more than one panel with data covering a particular point in
time. We use the 1987, 1988, 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993 panels, which cover the period from
October 1986 to August 1995 (the 1989 panel is not used because it was ended after only three
waves).
Our analysis sample is composed of children in original sample households (that is,
households interviewed in the first wave) who are younger than 16 years old at the first time they
are observed and live in states that are identified in the SIPP (40 states and the District of
Columbia are identified—the others are grouped for confidentiality). We drop children who are
observed only once (<1 percent of the sample), have breaks in their data (children who leave the
sample and then return—<3 percent of the sample) and children who move between states during
the sample period (approximately 4 percent of the sample).10 To address the possibility that our
results may be driven by spurious transitions (for example when a child is erroneously coded as
having public insurance in a given period although in fact he does not have public insurance in
that period nor in the preceding or following periods), we recode the data to eliminate any spells
of one month duration. Comparing the estimated coefficients in the linear probability models
using this smoothed data to results using the original data, we find that with the exception of the
coefficients on the lagged dependent variables, the coefficients are well within the confidence

10

Children with breaks in their data are dropped because their insurance status while out of the
sample is unknown, and this creates difficulties in the dynamic models. We drop children who move
between states during the sample because the relatively small number of such children made estimating
fixed effects models with state dummies included difficult. Results from models without fixed effects
including these children in the sample are essentially the same as the results when these children are not
included, however.

18

intervals. Unsurprisingly, the coefficients on the lagged dependent variables are higher in the
smoothed data. We report the coefficients from the smoothed data regressions below.
Another measurement issue in the SIPP is that of "seam bias." Census Bureau
researchers have shown that there are a disproportionate number of transitions in the fourth
(interview) month (see, e.g., Young 1989, Marquis and Moore 1990). The approach to this
problem that has been used in the past is to use index functions or transition rates that apply to
the four month period covered by the interview. However, this approach has the disadvantage
that the information on the timing of transitions that reportedly occurred in months other than the
seam month is lost. To test the importance of this seam bias problem for our results, we estimate
the models two different ways: using all of the monthly data and using only the fourth month of
each wave (dropping the first three months). The results are overall quite similar, and there is no
consistent pattern in the differences between coefficients. It is not the case that one specification
produces consistently larger or smaller coefficients, for example. For completeness we report
results from the four-month specification in the Appendix, but they are discussed only in the
cases when they differ substantially from the monthly data results.
Finally, due to the number of person-months in the sample, it proved computationally
infeasible to estimate our models on the entire sample of 1,930,740 person-months.
Consequently, we draw a 50 percent random sample of individuals and use all months for
individuals in that sample in our regressions.11
In Table 1 we present the sample means for the variables used in our regressions. The

11

In future drafts we will estimate the model from each 50% sample and then obtain overall
estimates by combining the estimates from the two samples using minimum distance.

19

insurance variables are private insurance and Medicaid, where we define private coverage to
include CHAMPUS coverage. A child may report both private and public coverage, although
this is relatively uncommon (only 1.8 percent of the total months). As noted above, we use two
alternative eligibility variables—a variable coded one if the child is imputed to be eligible in the
month according to age, family income, and the rules in effect that month (ELIG), and a variable
coded one if an expansion affecting that age child had been passed (AGEELIG). As has been
shown previously in CPS data, both eligibility and Medicaid coverage rise across the period,
while private coverage falls. The age-eligible variable starts the sample period below the
imputed eligibility variable (2.3 percent of months in the 1987 SIPP have AGEELIG=1 while
19.6 percent have ELIG=1) but rises quickly, and by the end of the sample period over threequarters of months have AGEELIG=1. Characteristics of the child and the family are also
included in the regressions. As we are examining health insurance, we use the "health insurance
unit" as the family definition. This is the family unit relevant for health insurance purposes—that
is, the head, spouse, and any minor children (or older children who are full-time students).

Results

A.

Static Model
Table 2 presents results from the static model of equation (2) for public and private

insurance. The first two columns in each panel show results without including state effects and
with state effects, while the third column gives the estimates from the exact specification used by
Cutler and Gruber (1996) in CPS data. In all columns the state-year-month-age eligibility index
FRACELIG is used as the instrument for eligibility.
20

Looking first at the Medicaid participation equation, the coefficients on the individual
and family demographic variables enter as expected and appear to be relatively stable across
specifications. Children who are white, have older parents, parents with more education, two
parents or only a male head (relative to being in a female-headed family), smaller families, or
who have at least one earner in their family, are significantly less likely to be enrolled in
Medicaid. Addition of state dummies affects primarily the coefficients on no earner and only a
male head, increasing both in absolute value. The state unemployment rate is positive and
significant until the state dummies are added, when it becomes insignificant.
The eligibility variable, which is positive and significant in all specifications, as expected,
is also strongly affected by the addition of state indicators, with the magnitude of the coefficient
falling from 0.196 to 0.120. This latter estimate implies that a ten-percentage point increase in
eligibility results in a 1.2 percentage-point increase in Medicaid coverage. The coefficient
changes little when the exact CPS specification is used. It is interesting to note that this estimate
is smaller than the corresponding coefficient in the 1988-1993 CPS data, which is 0.235 (Cutler
and Gruber 1996, p. 408) or the coefficient in the 1988-1996 CPS data, which is 0.197 (ShoreSheppard 1997). We explore possible reasons for this difference below.
The private insurance equation results are presented in the right-hand panel of Table 2.
Again the demographic and family variables have the signs expected—generally the opposite of
the signs in the Medicaid regression with the exception of the variables for the number of earners
in the family, which indicate that the more earners a family has, the more likely the children are
to have private coverage. The sign of the coefficient on eligible is positive and (when state
dummies are included) statistically insignificant. Again this is unlike the results from the CPS,
21

which showed a significantly negative relationship between eligibility and private coverage
(>0.074 in 1988-1993 (Cutler and Gruber 1996) or >0.091 in 1988-1996 (Shore-Sheppard
1997)).12
B.

Exploration of the Differences Between CPS and SIPP Results
There are several possible reasons why the CPS and SIPP results differ. First, the CPS

identifies all states while the SIPP does not identify the smallest states and consequently they are
dropped from our sample. To check the importance of this explanation, we estimated the model
using the CPS data and omitting states and ages not represented in the SIPP sample. This yielded
estimates of the coefficient on eligibility for the Medicaid equation of 0.136 (0.013) and for the
private equation of -0.070 (0.016) (corresponding to columns (3) and (6) of Table 2,
respectively). The Medicaid coefficient is thus quite close in the CPS and SIPP when equivalent
samples are compared, while the private coefficient remains very different.
Another possible reason for the remaining difference is the composition of the SIPP
sample: if through attrition the SIPP sample has become selected in some way, the results may
not be comparable to the CPS results. We explore this issue by running the models using only
data from the first year of each panel, since such data should suffer less from attrition. We find
that the estimates of the effect of eligibility are similar although somewhat smaller in absolute
value than when the whole sample is used, indicating that the difference does not appear to be
due to attrition in the SIPP.

12

The results using one observation per wave (presented in Appendix Table A1) are similar to
the results in Table 2, although they are somewhat closer to the CPS results–the coefficient on
eligibility is slightly larger in the Medicaid equation and negative (although insignificantly different
from zero) in the private insurance equation. The differences are not significant, however.
22

A third possible explanation for the CPS-SIPP discrepancy is that it arises from the
different methods of data collection in the CPS and SIPP. One primary difference between the
CPS and SIPP is the reference period of each survey: annual for the CPS, and monthly for the
SIPP. In order to explore the impact of the reference period on the estimates, we create a CPS
"look-alike" from the SIPP data. That is, we use the monthly data in SIPP to create an annual
observation for each child. There are several issues which arise when creating this look-alike
sample. First, attrition is likely to be more severe in a longitudinal survey such as the SIPP.
Second, as noted above, it is not clear how the CPS respondents answer the insurance questions
(Swartz 1986, Shore-Sheppard 1996). To address these issues, we create annual data from the
SIPP using several alternative hypotheses about the sample to use and the way respondents might
answer the CPS. We try three alternative samples of SIPP data: children who have 12 months of
data from the first full year of the panel; children who have 12 months of data early in the panel
(although not necessarily from the first full year); and children who have at least 6 months of data
from the first year of the panel. We combine these three samples with five possible assumptions
about how respondents might answer an annual (CPS) insurance question: as posed (had
insurance at any time in the previous year); at a point in time (had insurance the last month of the
year); over a shorter reference period (had insurance at any time in the last 3 months or
alternatively the last 6 months); and for the majority of the year (had insurance over half of the
time). For each of the three samples, variables other than the insurance status are summed over
the months in the SIPP to create annual data. In particular, to create eligibility, family income is
added over all of the months and eligibility is imputed using the annual data. Characteristics
such as family size are obtained from the last month of each sample (corresponding to the use of
23

March data on such variables in the CPS.)
Health insurance coverage rates in the CPS and SIPP look-alike data match most closely
when the sample used is children who had at least 6 months of data. Mean coverage rates for the
CPS and for this sample under the various assumptions are given in Table 3. For Medicaid, the
CPS coverage rates appear to match most closely the rates under the hypothesis that respondents
are answering the question as posed. For private coverage, however, the CPS appears to be
eliciting a lower level of coverage, with the rates matching most closely the rates arising from the
hypotheses that respondents are answering as of the last 3 months or the last 6 months.
The results from regressions using the look-alike samples are presented in Table 4. For
each sample, there are four specifications, corresponding to columns (2), (3), (5), and (6) of
Table 2. The entries show the coefficients on eligibility from the various assumptions.
Comparing the coefficients from the SIPP results in Table 4 to those in Table 2 and to the CPS
results (in the top row of Table 4), it appears that annualizing the SIPP data gives results that are
somewhat closer to the CPS results (larger coefficients on Medicaid, and smaller coefficients on
private coverage). Notably, however, the coefficients on private coverage remain smaller than in
the CPS results, and are not statistically different from zero. We conclude from this exercise that
the annual nature of the CPS data collection is not the only source of differences in the results;
the SIPP consistently provides lower (and statistically insignificant) estimates of the magnitude
of private coverage loss than does the CPS.
C.

Alternative Specifications of the Static Model
As discussed above, an alternative specification of the eligibility effect is to use

AGEELIG, a variable that is based solely on the eligibility expansions in place for that state24

month-age cell and that is therefore plausibly exogenous. In Table 5 we show estimates of
equation (1) using this variable. The table is divided into two panels, with the left panel showing
estimates using the 50 percent sample and the right panel showing estimates using a sample of
children from families with incomes less than 200 percent of the federal poverty line at the first
month. Since AGEELIG equals one for many children who will never qualify for Medicaid due
to their family income, using this variable may understate the true effect of the expansions on the
targeted population. Consequently we examine the effect of this variable in a population with a
higher probability of actually qualifying for Medicaid.13
The effects of AGEELIG on Medicaid enrollment in the 50 percent sample are consistent
with the effects found for imputed eligibility—being age-eligible for Medicaid increases the
likelihood a child is enrolled in Medicaid. While statistically different from zero, the estimated
effects are much smaller, however, as would be expected given the inclusion of children who are
age-eligible but unlikely to be actually eligible. For private insurance, there appears to be no
relationship between expansion eligibility and having private coverage.
The results in the poor sample are similar to those in the 50 percent sample, although
consistent with the interpretation that the effect of age-eligibility will be understated in the 50
percent sample, the coefficients on AGEELIG in the Medicaid equations are somewhat larger in
the poor sample. They are still not as large as the coefficients on actual eligibility in Table 2,
however. The private regression results are essentially the same as in the 50 percent sample, and
again there is no evidence of a negative relationship between eligibility and private coverage.

13

This strategy is similar to that of Blumberg, Dubay and Norton (2000) who use an eligibility
variable that only depends on age and a sample consisting only of poor and near-poor children in their
examination of data from the first and last panels of the 1990 SIPP.

25

Finally, although the eligibility variable is different, the individual and family explanatory
variables have quite similar coefficients in the eligibility and AGEELIG equations.14
D.

Allowing for Different Effects of Eligibility Over Time
In the models above, we have implicitly assumed that the effect of eligibility is constant

over time. However the use of panel data permits us to relax this assumption and allow the effect
of eligibility to differ between children who are newly eligible and children who have been
eligible for several months. If parents do not immediately enroll their children when the children
become eligible, then the effect of eligibility may differ depending on how long the child has
been eligible. We split eligibility into eligibility in the first four months and eligibility for five
months or more to test whether this may in fact be the case. The results of this specification are
presented in Table 6.15 From these results it is clear that children are not always immediately
enrolled upon becoming eligible, lending support to the concern that parents are either not aware
of their child’s eligibility or are aware but do not enroll their child until urgent care is needed.
Indeed, in the Medicaid regression the coefficient on the first four months of eligibility is actually
negative, while the coefficient on eligibility after five or more months is positive and larger in
magnitude than the effect of eligibility in Table 2. The coefficient indicates only a 1.6
percentage-point increase in coverage with a 10 percentage-point increase in eligibility, however,
so that even among children who have been eligible for several months the enrollment rate is
still relatively low. In the private regression, the two effects are similar in magnitude (both are

14

The corresponding results from the 4-month observations (Appendix Table A2) are similar
to the results in Table 5.
15

We did not use this specification earlier in order to keep our specification as comparable as
possible to that of earlier work.
26

insignificantly positive in the regression with state effects), and it is not possible to reject that the
effects are equal. (In both the Medicaid and private regressions the effects of the other covariates
are essentially unchanged by allowing the effect of eligibility to vary over time.) Thus children
appear to be more likely to be enrolled in Medicaid, but no more likely to have lost private
coverage, after having spent some time eligible for Medicaid.16
E.

Models Including Individual Fixed Effects
Models including fixed effects are presented in Table 7.17 These models relax the

assumption that the individual component of the error term is uncorrelated with the explanatory
variables. Each model is run using differences from individual means to eliminate the fixed
effect, and then re-run in first-differences as a specification check. The coefficients from both
types of fixed effects models appear to be smaller in absolute value than the coefficients from the
simple static models. In particular, the coefficient on eligibility in the Medicaid equation is
reduced to 0.040 (0.013 in the first-differenced model) from 0.120, and the coefficient on ageeligibility is reduced to 0.007 (0.002 in the first-differenced model) from 0.017. Including
individual fixed effects in the private insurance equation also reduces the magnitude of virtually
all of the estimated coefficients, and changes the sign of some. The coefficient on eligibility is
now negative (as would be the case in the presence of crowding out), although it is statistically
significant only when age-eligibility is used in the differences from individual means

16

The results using 4-month observations (Appendix Table A3) are similar to the results in
Table 6, although the first wave eligibility effects are smaller in the Medicaid regressions and larger
in the private regressions. In addition, in the private regressions we can now reject that the effects
for the first wave of eligibility are the same as those for longer periods of eligibility.
17

For simplicity in this and the following specifications, we return to using a single-variable
parameterization of eligibility.
27

specification.
There are two possible explanations for the reduction in the estimated coefficients when
fixed effects are used. First, as discussed above, the cross-sectional and fixed effects models may
be estimating different parameters, with the fixed effects models estimating a substitution effect
rather than a combined substitution and income effect. Second, the smaller size of the eligibility
coefficient may indicate that once the between-child variation in eligibility is removed, the
probability of taking up coverage among the newly eligible is smaller. This would be the case if
the propensity to take up public coverage differs across children. As the eligibility effects are
identified from children who become eligible over the course of the sample (and consequently
are likely to be further up the income distribution and have greater access to private coverage),
this explanation for the smaller coefficients when fixed effects are included is plausible.18
Although the coefficients are similar in sign in the two types of fixed effects
specifications, they do differ, with the estimated coefficients from the difference from individual
means specification generally being larger. This suggests that a model that takes account of
dynamics in insurance coverage may be more appropriate.
F.

Simple Dynamic Models
In this section we relax the assumption that insurance choice in the current period is

independent of last period's choice by estimating simple dynamic models. The results are presented
in Table 8 (using the endogenous eligibility variable) and in Table 9 (using the exogenous age-

18

Again the results from the four-month data are similar, although the eligibility coefficients
are generally larger in the Medicaid regressions, and more negative in the private regressions (both
eligibility coefficients using differences from individual means are significantly different from zero).
The coefficients on family structure are also generally larger.
28

eligibility variable). In each table we present three specifications for the two insurance types. The
first specification in columns (1) and (4) is a levels specification, which assumes that the individual
component of the error is uncorrelated with the explanatory variables

. Since the lagged

dependent variable is likely to be correlated with the error term (i.e., we would expect to find
autocorrelation when not controlling for person-specific factors through a fixed effect), we include
FRACELIG, AGEELIG, and lags of those variables and the family characteristics in the first stage
regression for the lagged dependent variable but exclude these variables from the second stage
equation. The second specification in columns (2) and (5) relaxes the assumption of uncorrelated
individual effects, but assumes that there is no serial correlation in the transitory component error
term, (i.e., errors for the same individual are correlated over time only because of the person-specific
effect). This assumption allows us to use further lags of the dependent variable as additional
instruments in the first stage equation. The final specification in columns (3) and (6) allows for the
possibility of serial correlation in the transitory component of the error term. In this case the lags of
the dependent variable are no longer valid instruments, and we include the same explanatory
variables in the first stage equation as in columns (1) and (4). The corresponding estimates for the
data based on the 4 month observations are given in Appendix Table A5. Here we will discuss both
sets of estimates as there are substantial differences between the parameter estimates in Table 8 and
Table A5.
As a summary statistic we first estimate an autoregressive model with no explanatory
variables. Not surprisingly, there is a very high degree of persistence in the data–the coefficients
(standard errors) on lagged coverage in the monthly data are 0.951 (0.001) and 0.959 (0.0004) in the
Medicaid and private regresssions, respectively. In the four-month data the autoregressive
coefficients for the same equations are estimated as 0.814 (0.002) and 0.830 (0.001), respectively.
29

As noted above, columns (1) and (4) add regressors to the simple specification and treat the lagged
dependent variable as endogenous. As one might expect, the lagged dependent variable has
substantial and significant coefficients in both insurance equations, even when covariates are
included. The immediate impact of Medicaid eligibility in the public insurance equation is estimated
to be 0.013, and the estimated long run effect is thus 0.013/(1 - 0.948) = 0.25, which is substantially
larger than the estimate in column (2) of Table 2. The impact and long run effects of eligibility in
the private insurance equation are 0.024 and 0.072, with the long run effect being substantially larger
than the estimate in column (5) of Table 2. The long run effects from columns (1) and (4) of Table
A5 (based on the four-month data) are 0.235 in the public insurance equation and 0.056 in the
private insurance equation, which are quite close to the estimates from the monthly data. These
results indicate that eligibility for Medicaid may have a cumulative effect, with relatively low takeup rates in the short run, but higher take-up in the long run.
The results in columns (2) and (5) of Tables 8 and A5, which allow for fixed effects and
include lagged dependent variables while assuming the transitory error is serially uncorrelated, are
relatively unstable and implausible. First, the coefficients on the lagged dependent variable are
much smaller in the four-month data. Second, the long run eligibility effects differ widely between
the monthly and four-month data. The long run effects for public insurance are 0.090 and 0.115 in
the monthly and four-month data respectively, while the long run eligibility effects in the private
insurance equation are 0.857 and -0.071. Further doubt concerning the estimates in columns (2) and
(5) in each Table is generated by comparing them with columns (3) and (6) of each Table. If the lags
of the dependent variable are valid instrumental variables, the results in columns (3) and (6) should
be similar to those in columns (2) and (5), but should be less precise. While we have not carried out
a formal Hausman test, it is clear that this is not the case in Tables 8 and A5, with the differences for
30

the private insurance equation estimated from monthly data being the most pronounced. Considering
the public insurance equation in column (3) first, the long run effect of Medicaid eligibility is 0.048
in the monthly data and 0.094 in the four-month data. For the private insurance results shown in
column (6), the long run eligibility effects are -0.0024 and -0.044 in the monthly data and the fourmonth data respectively. Thus it appears that the assumption of serially uncorrelated errors is
unlikely to hold in the data. If we discard the estimates in columns (2) and (5) of Tables 8 and A5 as
being rejected by the data, the dynamic models produce a range of estimates similar to the range
produced by the static models. In particular, the long run estimates from the dynamic specification
in levels are similar to, though larger than, the estimates from the static levels models, while the
dynamic specification including fixed effects produces estimates that are similar to the static fixed
effects estimates but again are somewhat larger in magnitude.
Table 9 and Appendix Table A6 contain the dynamic specifications for the case where
AGEELIG is used as the measure of Medicaid eligibility. The results are quite similar to those in
Tables 8 and A5, except that the coefficient on eligibility is no longer implausibly large when first
differences are used and the lagged dependent variables are assumed to be valid instrumental
variables. There is a similar relationship to that described above between the dynamic and static
results using AGEELIG, with the long run results from the dynamic model in levels being generally
larger than the results from the static model, and similarly with the fixed effects. While most of the

long run results from the dynamic models are broadly in agreement with the static results, the
differences between the long run and impact results show that the underlying dynamics of
insurance choice are an important part of an examination of the behavioral effects of the
Medicaid expansions. As we have only begun to explore the dynamics of insurance choice in
this paper, this topic is an important one for future work.

VI.

Conclusions
In this paper we use data from the SIPP and static and dynamic discrete panel data models

to examine the impact of expansions in Medicaid eligibility on public and private insurance
coverage. Our results indicate that the expansions resulted in increased Medicaid coverage, but
unlike previous research, we find little evidence of a statistically significant negative relationship
between eligibility for Medicaid and private coverage. Further, not only are the estimates of the
impact on private coverage generally insignificant, but the SIPP estimates are also consistently
smaller than the estimates from the CPS. The SIPP also produces a somewhat lower estimate of
public insurance take-up than does the CPS. Our estimates do not change qualitatively when the
SIPP data are annualized to resemble the CPS. Consequently it does not appear that the
differences in the CPS and SIPP results are due solely to the annual nature of the CPS data
collection.
We use the panel nature of the SIPP to relax several econometric constraints in the static
specification of insurance coverage used in the CPS. Allowing the effects of eligibility to differ
for children who have just become eligible and children who have been eligible for several
months, we find that children appear to be more likely to be enrolled in Medicaid but no more
likely to have lost private coverage after having spent some time eligible. Including a fixed
effect to allow for permanent unobserved characteristics of the child and family reduces the
magnitude of the estimated take-up effect, while the fixed effects estimates for the private
insurance regression become negative and marginally statistically significant in some
specifications. Finally, we examine simple dynamic models of insurance choice, relaxing the
assumption that insurance choice in each period is independent of the previous period's choices.
32

We find that insurance choice is quite persistent. When dynamics are accounted for, the
estimated long run impact of eligibility is somewhat larger than the (constant) effect estimated
from static models, while the immediate impact of expanded Medicaid eligibility in the dynamic
models is smaller than the static estimate. Thus both the dynamic specification and the
specification allowing the effect of eligibility to differ with time indicate that in determining the
impact of the expansions, it is important to account for the fact that some children may not enroll
immediately. From a policy perspective, these results indicate that a strategy to increase the takeup of Medicaid among eligible children would be to inform parents about the possibility that
their child is eligible and/or to inform parents of the benefits of enrolling their child in Medicaid.
Such information may help reduce the apparent gap between eligibility onset and enrollment.
In this research we have used panel data to relax several implicit assumptions made in
static models and begun to explore the dynamics of insurance choice in the presence of public
insurance unrelated to cash assistance. However more research is necessary for a full
understanding of the underlying dynamic processes. For example, in future work we will explore
transitions between insurance states in more detail, examining when children move between the
states of private insurance, public insurance, and no insurance, and how those transitions are
related both to the expansion of public coverage and to employment changes in the child's family.
Using the SIPP we can address questions such as whether the expansions changed the length of
time children spend uninsured and how events such as job loss of the family head affect
insurance coverage. However it is important to recognize that while the SIPP is a rich source of
information on employment and insurance coverage over time, there are several questions we are
unable to answer using the SIPP. In particular, the SIPP does not provide information on
33

whether parents are offered health insurance for themselves or their dependents or any
information on the parameters of the insurance coverage they have (such as premiums or copayments). Finally, while there is information on health status of adults in the SIPP, such
information is very limited for the children in the data. Consequently, it is unlikely that
questions involving the effects of such factors on insurance dynamics can be answered for the
period of the Medicaid expansions.

Notes: Each entry in the table is the coefficient on eligibility from a regression on the look-alike sample created
using the specified reference period assumption and data. "Annual" assumes the respondents answer the CPS
insurance questions as posed, "last month" assumes the respondents' reference period is the last month of the period,
"last 3 months" and "last 6 months" assume the respondents use a reference period of the previous 3 months and 6
months, respectively, and "majority of year" assumes the respondents answer the insurance questions according to
the type of insurance they had for the most time in the previous year.
