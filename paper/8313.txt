Introduction

In this paper, we examine how open capital market policies would interact with the degree of
price rigidity in the domestic economy to affect the output-inflation tradeoffs and, similarly,
the volatilities of output and inflation in response to nominal shocks.

In the discussion, we extend to an open-trade and open-capital economy

the succinct exposition of Woodford (2000), which is conducted in the context of a closed
economy.
Why is such extension potentially useful? Evidently, the degree of price stickiness is
related to the organization of markets–for instance, whether the labor market is common
or segmented.

Similarly, the degree of price stickiness can be affected by the openness of

the economy both in commodity trade and capital mobility.
As an illustration, consider the evidence in Figure 1 below.

The left panel measures

the extent to which 4 groups of countries restrict capital movements based on the IMF’s
Annual Report on Exchange Rate Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions.

The right

panel provides their corresponding average output-inflation tradeoff parameters as estimated
by Ball, Mankiw, and Romer (1988).

The figure shows clearly that countries with greater

restrictions on capital mobility tend to have steeper Phillips curves.

This finding has been

recently substantiated by econometric estimations (see, Loungani, Razin, and Yuen (2001)).

>From now on, we shall focus on the relation between aggregate supply of goods and
consumption smoothing made possible by international capital mobility.

For this purpose,

we would not be concerned about the details of aggregate demand (including the demand for
money), international commodity trade, and the determination of the exchange rate.

For

simplicity, separability between consumption and real money balances is assumed for the
utility function.
The relevant utility-maximizing conditions for our purpose include an intratemporal
condition for the choice of labor supply of type

j:

vh (ht (j ); ξ t )
uc (Ct ; ξ t )

=

wt (j )
Pt

(2)

and an intertemporal condition for the consumption-saving choice:

uc (Ct ; ξ t )
uc (Ct+1 ; ξ t+1)

where

=

β (1 + r∗ ),

(3)

r ∗ is the world real rate of interest, assumed for simplicity to be time-invariant.

This

latter equality is a consequence of the covered interest parity and the Fisher equation.
As in the Dixit-Stiglitz model, demand for good

satisfies

(4)

The production function assumes the form

yt (j ) = At f (ht (j )),
where

A is a random productivity shock.

The variable cost of supplying

yt (j ) is wt (j )f −1(yt (j )/At ),

which implies a (real) marginal cost of

st (j ) =

wt (j )
.
Pt At f  (f −1 (yt (j )/At ))

Using (2), we can replace the real wage above by the marginal rate of substitution. Imposing

j

symmetry across firms (so that we can drop the index ), the above equation can be rewritten

The Phillips curve

This section derives the expectations-augmented Phillips curve of the kind hypothesized by
Friedman (1968) and Phelps (1970) for both open and closed economies.
In order to obtain a tractable solution, we log-linearize the equilibrium conditions
around the steady state. We assume that

As discussed in Woodford (2000), these sensitivity parameters are related to the degree of strategic complementarity among price setters.

In turn, the latter depends on the

organization of markets. For instance, strategic substitutability (complementarity) will prevail if all factor prices are (cannot be) instantaneously equalized across suppliers of different
goods, the case of common (segmented) factor markets. In our case, we show another example where the organization of the world capital market matters–in particular, the integration or not of the domestic capital market into the world market.

Consumption smoothing,

which comes with the opening of the capital market, will increase the degree of strategic
complementarity, thus rendering prices more sticky and magnifying output responses.
