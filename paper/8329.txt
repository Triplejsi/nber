Introduction

Social Security represents an important source of retirement wealth for most Americans. As shown in Table 1, Social Security represents a large fraction of the wealth
of retirees.1 For the median retiree, Social Security represents 25% of total retirement assets, and 49% of liquid retirement assets (assets that either yield cash, such
as Social Security and pensions, or assets easily converted to cash, such as financial
assets and IRAs). Social Security is even more important as a source of retirement
income for individuals in the lower lifetime earnings percentiles (i.e., excluding the
very lowest 5%). Further, the Social Security Administration reports that Social
Security represents 40% of all income to the aged population, and it accounts for over
50% of income for two-thirds of ‚Äúbeneficiary units‚Äù (couples or nonmarried persons).
Further, Social Security is the only sources of income for 18% of the aged population.2
Social Security is typically viewed as a very safe vehicle for retirement saving‚Äîin
fact, a major criticism of proposals to reform Social Security to allow participants
to hold financial assets such as equities is that there is much higher risk associated
with traded financial assets, compared with the traditional Social Security system.
A discussion of Social Security risk under the current system would probably focus
on the uncertainty regarding future changes in eligibility and the rules for computing
benefits. Yet there is an important, frequently overlooked source of Social Security
risk that is related to the way that Social Security contributions are indexed, or
‚Äúmarked up‚Äù during an individual‚Äôs working life. The Social Security system uses a
measure of aggregate labor income, called the Social Security Wage Index (SSWI), to
index individuals‚Äô contributions to the Social Security system. The rate of growth
of the SSWI is a measure of the return on Social Security contributions during an
individual‚Äôs working life. This return is uncertain, since the future rate of growth
of the SSWI is unknown. As with any other financial asset, the average return and
risk of Social Security will be important for portfolio construction for an individual
during his working life. Because Social Security represents an important source of
wealth, yet is not tradable in financial markets, an individual will want to structure
the tradable portion of his or her portfolio in a way that hedges, as well as possible,

the risk arising from Social Security.
Although Social Security wealth is an important element of an individual‚Äôs nontraded wealth, by far the largest component of total wealth is an the individual‚Äôs human capital, which is also nontradable. Table 2, taken from Baxter and King (1999),
shows that human capital is the dominant component of an individual‚Äôs wealth for
all individuals except those on the very brink of retirement. For most individuals,the
value of human capital is 5 to 20 times as large as the individual‚Äôs net worth; this ratio
is larger for younger individuals, and is smaller for individuals over age 55. But even
for these older individuals, human capital is still somewhat larger than net worth.
Given that human capital and Social Security are both important nontraded assets, a key element in evaluating the riskiness of the current Social Security scheme
will be the covariance between the return on Social Security (the growth rate of the
SSWI) and the return on human capital (roughly, the growth rate of labor income).
In particular, the higher is the correlation between the SSWI and the individual‚Äôs
own labor income process, the greater will be the individual‚Äôs interest in participating in a reformed Social Security system that permits investment of retirement funds
in traded financial assets that can help hedge this nontraded risk.
This paper investigates how Social Security risk during the accumulation phase
varies across individuals who dier according to gender; education; race; and age
group. The main finding is that there are important dierences across groups in this
component of Social Security risk, as captured by the sensitivity of individual-level
income growth to changes in the SSWI. This element of risk is most important for
women, especially women who are young-to-middle aged and with more education.
This analysis suggests that women would have more to gain, compared with men,
from a reformed Social Security system that would permit investment of retirement
funds in other forms of financial assets.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data, which are drawn
from the PSID and explains how the dierent sub-groups are structured. This section
also presents summary information on the income process for these groups. Section 3
describes the risk/return properties of the Social Security asset, and the relationship
between the SSWI and other measures of aggregate economic activity. Section 4
presents an illustrative model of the link between human capital returns and the
returns on the Social Security asset. Section 5 contains the paper‚Äôs empirical results
on Social Security risk across socio-economic groups; Section 6 concludes with a
3

discussion of the implications of our results for the potential benefits from a reformed
Social Security system.

Data

The data for this study were taken from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics. The
data are annual, covering the years 1967-1991. Further details concerning the data
can be found in the Data Appendix.
Since the focus of this study is on Social Security risk during the accumulation
phase (i.e., during an individual‚Äôs working life), individuals who were older than 66
years in the last year of our sample (1992) were discarded, as were non-working
individuals (those with zero labor income in every year). An individual was listed
as ‚Äúmarried‚Äù if they were married to the same person throughout the sample period;
an individual is ‚Äúsingle‚Äù if they were unmarried throughout the sample. We report
results separately for black and white individuals; there were too few individuals in
the remaining race categories to perform meaningful analysis. In terms of education,
individuals were assigned to one of three educational groups, corresponding to the
highest educational level achieved by the end of the sample period. The first group
has less than 12 years of education (less than a high school education); the second
group has exactly 12 years of schooling (a high school degree), and the third group
has more than 12 years of schooling. Finally, we also study three dierent age groups,
where age is measured at the end of the sample period. The first group has age less
than 46 years; the second group covers ages 46-55; and the third group covers ages
56-65.
Table 3 contains information on mean nominal income, income growth, and the
variability of nominal income growth for the various groups. As is well known, the
level of income is higher for men than for women; is higher for whites compared with
blacks, and is generally higher for higher education levels. Single women tend to
have higher incomes than married women.
The average change in income is reported in the next-to-last column of Table
3. Because many individuals had zero labor income in some periods, we cannot
report the growth rate of income; rather, this column reports the change in the level
of nominal labor income from one period to the next. The average income change
varies quite a bit across groups, tending to be higher for single females compared with
4

married females, and tends to be higher for groups with more education, although
this eect is not strong. Finally, the last column reports the average standard
deviation of income changes for individuals within the group. That is: the standard
deviation of income changes was computed for each individual in the group, and then
the average standard deviation across group members was computed; this measure of
income volatility varies widely across groups.

Social Security as a Risky Financial Asset

During their working years, individuals make ‚Äòcontributions‚Äô to the Social Security
system. Specifically, the individual and employer together contribute 12.4% of income
up to a cap, which is currently $72, 600. The Social Security Administration indexes,
or ‚Äòmarks up,‚Äô the individual‚Äôs contributions each year between the contribution date
and the individual‚Äôs retirement date. This is done so that benefits reflect the increase
in the general level of wages between the particular working year in which the wages
were earned (and contributions were made) and the retirement date.
This indexation is reflected in the computation of the individual‚Äôs ‚ÄúAverage Indexed Monthly Earnings,‚Äù or AIME. The AIME is constructed as follows. Let
W t+j denote the national average wage index for year t + j, and let W t+R denote the
national average wage index for the retirement year, t + R.3 The worker‚Äôs indexed
indexed
earnings Wt+j
are computed as follows:

A worker who contributes $1 to Social Security will have that $1 ‚Äòmarked up,‚Äô
according to the AIME formula (1), by the rate of change of the Social Security wage
indexing series for each period between the contribution date and the retirement date.
That is:
$1 at date t grows to:
√É

W t+1

The ‚Äúnational average wage index‚Äù computed by Social Security is actually a measure of average
income for covered workers. As such, it is comparable to a measure of average per capita labor
income, not an average wage rate.

Equation (2) shows that the nominal return during the accumulation phase to
$1 ‚Äòinvested‚Äô in Social Security is the growth rate of the wage indexing series, since
this is the amount by which the $1 is ‚Äòmarked up‚Äô each period up to the retirement
SS
date. Let‚Äôs use the notation rt+1

The individual‚Äôs Social Security benefit during retirement is a concave function of
the individual‚Äôs AIME. Specifically, the individual‚Äôs ‚ÄúPrimary Insurance Amount,‚Äù
PIA, equals 90% of the first $477 of AIME plus 32% of AIME over $477 through
$2,875 plus 15% of AIME over $2875. Through eq. (4) it is evident that the Social
Security benefit depends on the rate of return on the Social Security asset during the
accumulation phase.
To learn more about the properties of the Social Security asset, Figure 1 plots
the growth rates of nominal GNP, per capital nominal labor income, and the Social
Security Wage Index. As is evident from the figure, and can be seen in detail in
4

The AIME calculation may exclude some low-wage years and years of non-employment‚Äîa feature
not captured by our formula.

Table 4, these series are highly correlated with each other, and display similar levels
of volatility. Specifically, the mean growth rate for nominal GNP was 6.95% per
year over the period the 1951-1996 period, while per capita income grew at 5.66%
per year and the SSWI grew at 5.10% per year. GNP growth was somewhat more
volatile than labor income growth or SSWI growth: (GNP growth had a standard
deviation of 2.73% per year compared with 2.46% per year for labor income growth
and 2.23% per year for SSWI growth). The correlation between GNP growth and
per capita labor income growth was 0.92, whereas SSWI growth had a correlation of
only 0.71 with GNP growth and 0.72 with per capita labor income growth.

Human capital and Social Security:
trative model

An illus-

This section presents a model of the link between Social Security returns and human
capital returns during an individual‚Äôs working lifetime. To simplify the present value
calculations, we will assume that an individual lives forever. The period-t value of a
individual‚Äôs human capital, Ht is the present discounted value of current and future
labor income, Yt , where we assume that the discount factor, 4, is time-invariant:
Ht =

"
X

4j Et Yt+j .

j=0

7

(5)

To proceed, we must specify the statistical process for labor income and its relationship to the SSWI. We assume that the SSWI is a random walk, so that
SSW It = kSSW I + SSW It31 + 0t

(6)

where 0t  i.i.d. N (0, j 20 ).
An individual‚Äôs labor income, Yt , may depend on aggregate economic activity as
well as individual-specific factors. We let the aggregate factor be the SSWI, which we
have seen is strongly correlated with GNP and with the national accounts‚Äô measure
of aggregate labor income. Letting Xt denote the individual-specific variables, we
specify that:
Yt = kY + q(SSW It ) + Xt + ut
(7)
where ut  i.i.d. N (0, j 2u ). To simplify the analysis, suppose that Xt is a single
variable and is also a random walk, so that
Xt = kX + Xt31 + D t .

(8)

The change in the expected value of period-t human capital will then be given by:
Ht  Et31 Ht =

"
X

4j (Et Yt+j  Et31 Yt+j ) .

(9)

Equation (9) illustrates that eect of innovations in the permanent and temporary
components of income on the revision in the valuation of human capital. Recall
that 0t is the innovation in the stochastic trend that is identified with SSWI; D t is
the innovation in the individual-specific stochastic trend; and ut is the temporary,
individual-specific disturbance to income.
Innovations in the stochastic trends dominate the revision in the valuation of
human capital. For example, if an individual has a discount factor of 4 = 0.95, and
has q = 1 (which would be the average beta for all working individuals, as long as
the SSWI is exactly the same thing as average per capita labor income), then a 1%
increase in SSW It (0t = 0.01) will lead to a 20% upward revision in the individual‚Äôs
valuation of his human capital (1/(1  0.95) = 0.20). Even if an individual had a
8

low value of q, say q = 0.30, a 1% increase in SSW It would lead to a 6% upward
revision in the valuation of human capital (0.30/(1  0.95) = 0.06). By contrast, a
1% increase in the transitory component of income, ut = 0.01, will lead to only a 1%
increase in the value of human capital.
This analysis shows that the permanent components of income changes will dominate revisions in the valuation of human capital; this will be true even if these
permanent components explain, in a R2 sense, very little of the time-series variation
in income. To see this, imagine running a regression based on the first-dierence of
equation (7):
(10)
{Yt = k + q({SSW It ) + {Xt + {ut
where the operator { indicates the first-dierence in the levels of a variable, e.g.,
{Yt  Yt  Yt31 .5 The R2 from the regression (10) would then be:
R2 =

q 2 j 20 +  2 j 2D
.
q 2 j 20 +  2 j 2D + 2j 2u

(11)

For many individuals, income fluctuations may be dominated by individual-specific,
temporary influences. That is: 2j 2u may be much larger than (q 2 j 20 +  2 j 2D ), leading
to a low R2 . Yet the revisions in the value of human capital will still be dominated
by innovations in the trend components of income, since only these components have
a persistent eect on future income. The returns on an individual‚Äôs human capital
will be strongly related to the returns on SSWI if the dominant trend in an individual‚Äôs income is the trend that is shared with the SSWI. The next section provides
empirical evidence on this point.

5

Empirical evidence

This section presents empirical evidence on the time series behavior of labor income
for various socio-economic groups, and documents the extent to which labor income
is related to changes in the SSWI. The section begins with an informal look at the
data, and then proceeds to estimation of group-level regressions of income growth on
the SSWI.
5

The estimation of the income regressions carried out in Section 5 will use a dierenced version
of the income equation because we do not have data on the individual-specific variables, X. With
data on X, estimation in levels would be preferred; without data on X, potential problems with
spurious regression means that estimation in dierences is preferred.

5.1

Labor income and the SSWI: A first look

A typical individual‚Äôs labor income is much more volatile than the SSWI; this was
illustrated in Table 4. Yet the extent to which Social Security represents a security
with returns that are highly correlated with those of human capital depends on subtler
issues, which we explore in this section.
The most important determinant of the correlation of the returns between Social
Security and human capital is the relationship between the trends in the SSWI and
the individual‚Äôs labor income. To gain an idea of these trends, Figure 2-A plots the
SSWI together with labor income for the 9 individuals in the first socioeconomic group
reported in Table 2: married white females with less than a high school education
and age <46 at the end of the sample period. This figure suggests that there is
little relationship between the trend behavior of the SSWI and the trend behavior of
income for individuals in this group; indeed, there does not seem to be any trend at
all in group income.
Figure 2-B plots the SSWI together with labor income for the first 15 individuals
in our sample from the group of married white females with more than a high school
education, and aged 46-55 years at the end of the sample period (there are 69 such
individuals in the sample). In contrast to Figure 2-A, there does appear to be a
definite trend to income within this group, which might possibly be similar to the
trend in the SSWI. To explore this possibility, Figure 2-C plots income divided by
the SSWI for the same 15 individuals. The resulting variables appear to have much
less pronounced trends, and for many individuals it seems that a null hypothesis of
stationarity in this variable might not be rejected. In any case, normalizing the
SSWI appears to account for most of the trend in income for most individuals in this
category.

5.2

Specification of individual-level regressions

Following eq. (13), we specify the change in the SSWI as a random walk, possibly
with drift, and also allowing the possibility of a deterministic, as well as a stochastic
trend, as follows:
SSW It = kSSW I + ¬µSSW I t + SSW It31 + 0t

(12)

{SSW It = ¬µSSW I + 0t .

(13)

10

where 0t  i.i.d. N(0, j 20 ). We modify eq. (7), to include a possible time trend, and
we specify that the change in an individual‚Äôs labor income depends on SSW It , with
a coe!cient that depends on the individual‚Äôs socioeconomic group. :
Yijt = kij + ¬µYij t + q j SSW It +  ij Xijt + uijt

(14)

where uijt  i.i.d. N (0, j 2uij ). Finally, we modify the process for the individualspecific variables to allow a time trend:
Xijt = kXij + ¬µXij t + Xij,t31 + D ijt
with D ijt  i.i.d. N(0, j 2D ij ). We will further assume that there is no correlation
between aggregate influences on the individual‚Äôs wage, as reflected in SSW It , and
the individual-specific influences captured in Xijt .
Because of the potential presence of stochastic trends combined with the unavailability of data on Xijt , equation (14) was estimated in the following form, where
the { operator indicates the change in the level of a variable, e.g., {SSW It =
SSW It  SSW It31 :
{Yijt = (¬µYij +  ij ¬µXij ) + q j {SSW It + l ijt ,

(15)

where l ijt   ij ({Xijt  ¬µXij ) + (uijt  uij,t31 ).

5.3

Results

The results from the estimation of (15) are presented in Table 5. For each socioeconomic group, the table reports the estimate of q j and the standard error of the
estimate, and the R2 of the regression.6 Since our specification of the income process
assumes that the coe!cient on {SSW It depends on the group but not on individual
characteristics, it may be of interest to know how much explanatory power there is
in a regression of the change in group mean income, {Y jt , on {SSW It :
{Y jt = kj + q j {SSW It + l jt .

(16)

Table 5 shows that there are important dierences across groups in the sensitivity
of income growth to changes in the SSWI; there are also important dierences in the
extent to which growth in the SSWI explains income growth. Those groups that
have the highest estimates of q j are white females, especially those with at least a
high school education, and especially those who are in the middle age group (46-55
years) at the end of the sample. For example, the estimate of q j is 1.73 (s.e. = 0.35)
for married white females with more than a high school education and age between
46-55 years. The corresponding number for single females with otherwise the same
characteristics is qb j = 0.97 (s.e. = 0.18). There are many other instances of large
positive estimates of q j within the white female subgroups. By contrast, black
females tend not to have large estimates of q j : the exceptions are in those categories
described above: individuals with more education and who are at least 46 years old
at the end of the sample period. For example, married black females with more than
a high school education have estimates of q j equal to 0.47 (the age 46-55 group) and
1.20 (the age 56-65 group). The sample sizes are small within this group, and the
estimated standard errors are large, so it is less clear that there is a strong positive
dependence of income growth on SSWI growth for these groups. Table 5 also reports
estimates of q for larger groups, e.g., all married white females taken together, with a
single q j estimated for the group. These results confirm the earlier impression that
there is a strong, positive, and significant relationship between income growth and
SSWI growth for white women, both married and single, but not for black women.
Turning to the results for men, we find that here is very little evidence that income
growth for men is systematically related to changes in the SSWI. This is surprising,
since men are a larger share of the labor force; they account for most of labor income;
and are more likely to be continuously employed than are females. Since the SSWI is
a measure of aggregate labor income, it would have been natural to expect a strong,
significant relationship in the mens‚Äô regressions. While there are positive coe!cient
estimates in some cases, notably for the more-educated white men (in parallel with
the results for women), there is not the same strong systematic relationship that we
observed for women. This is reflected in the group estimates for q j , which are all
small and insignificant (with the exception of the Single Black Male category, which
contains only 1 individual).
There are also important dierences across socioeconomic groups in terms of the
explanatory power of SSWI growth for income growth. For the individual-level
12

regressions for women (estimation of (15)), the R2 s range from 0.00 to about 0.20.
Further, some of the largest values of the R2 correspond to those cases for which the
estimated q j are large and significant: specifically, women with at least a high school
education. The explanatory power of the individual regressions for men is much
lower. Finally, the last column of Table 3 presents the R2 for the group regression,
eq. (16). There is a great deal of heterogeneity across groups in the extent to which
SSWI changes can explain changes in group income, but once again the highest
R2 s occur for regressions of women‚Äôs income, especially white women. For example,
SSWI growth explains 83% of mean income growth for married white women with
more than a high school education and ages 46-55. SSWI growth explains 80% of
mean income growth for married white women, 50% of income growth for single white
women, 58% of income growth for married black females, but only 25% of income
growth for single black females. The results for the men show that the explanatory
power of SSWI changes is lower than for the corresponding category for women (e.g.,
SSWI growth explains only 39% of income growth for married white males, compared
with 80% for married white females). Further, there are only a few sub-categories for
which there is a large group R2 : most of these are sub-categories of married white
males.
Table 6 recomputes estimation of group-level q coe!cients using data on all individuals who had some labor income during the sample period, i.e., not excluding
those individuals who had a change in marital status during the sample period.7 On
the whole, the results from Table 6 reinforce the main impression gained from Table 5: women‚Äôs labor income tends to have a component that is closely related to
movements in the SSWI, while men‚Äôs labor income appears largely unrelated to the
SSWI. Labor income growth for white women, taken as a group, is strongly related
to the SSWI, with an estimated qb = 0.62 with a standard error of 0.13. By contrast,
the q for black women is only qb = 0.06. The estimate of q rises with educational
attainment, from a low of q = 0.03 (s.e. = 0.17) for women with less than a high
school education, to qb = 0.99 (s.e. = 0.22) for women with more than a high school
education. The link between the SSWI and labor income is also stronger for younger
women: the group with age less than 46 years at the end of sample has qb = 1.01
(s.e. = 0.28); the group aged 46-55 years has qb = 0.71 (s.e. = 0.15), while the group
7
This increases the number of women in the sample from 575 to 1012, and increases the number
of men in the sample from 509 to 632.

13

that is near retirement at the end of sample, ages 56-65 years, has a low estimate of
qb = 0.12 (s.e. = 0.21).
By contrast, there are few sub-groups of men for which there is a positive, significant relationship between labor income growth and SSWI growth. In fact, there
are only a few positive estimates of q. These groups are men with more than a high
school education, with q = 0.47; those with ages less than 46 years at the end of the
sample period (q = 0.56), and those aged 46-55 years (q = 0.70). However, the estimated standard errors of these estimates are much larger than for the corresponding
women‚Äôs groups, so that the estimated q coe!cients cannot be viewed as significantly
dierent from zero for any of the sub-groups.
The bottom panel of Table 6 computes estimates by sub-group when men and
women are taken together. Given the disparity between the results for women‚Äôs
sub-groups and men‚Äôs sub-groups, these results should be taken with a grain of salt.
That said, the impression from this combined sample is that the groups with the
highest sensitivity to SSWI growth are groups of individuals with more education
and young-to-middle-aged individuals.

Benefits from Social Security reform

The empirical results of the preceding sub-sections suggest that there are important
dierences across socio-economic groups in the sensitivity of labor income growth
to changes in the SSWI. Labor income growth is approximately the rate of return
on human capital, and because changes in the SSWI are related to the return on
Social Security during the accumulation phase (i.e., during an individual‚Äôs working
life). Since human capital and Social Security represent two important, non-traded
assets for an individual, a positive covariance between the returns on these assets is
undesirable. To see why, consider the following. Suppose an individual experiences
a period of low growth of labor income. If this individual has a large q on SSWI
growth, then the period of low growth of labor income is likely to correspond to a
period in which the Social Security return is low, i.e., the individual‚Äôs contributions
to Social Security will be marked up by a low percentage amount. That is: a period
in which low income means a reduced ability to consume in the present and save for
the future corresponds to a period in which the value of the Social Security asset also
grows by a small amount.
14

In fact, things can be much worse than this. The illustrative model of Section 4
and the informal empirical analysis of Section 5 suggested that labor income growth
and SSWI growth likely share a stochastic trend: if so, this stochastic trend will likely
dominate human capital returns. In this case, a negative innovation in this stochastic
trend corresponds to a large, negative shock to the value of an individual‚Äôs human
capital (with a corresponding negative impact on current and future consumption)
and at the same time corresponds to a large, negative shock to the expected future
value of the Social Security asset, thus reducing expected future consumption from
this source.
The first lesson of portfolio theory is that individual‚Äôs should hold diversified
portfolios, so that negative returns on one asset will tend to be oset by positive
returns on other assets. But in the scenario just sketched out, the individual has a
portfolio of assets‚Äîhuman capital and Social Security‚Äîwith highly correlated returns.
What can be done to improve this situation?
Ideally, the individual would like to trade in financial assets that have returns
highly correlated with the returns on these nontraded assets. In Section 3, we saw
that returns on the SSWI are highly correlated with the growth rates of GNP and
aggregate labor income. ‚ÄúMacro markets‚Äù of the type advocated by Robert Shiller
(1993) would be useful as hedging vehicles for the risk associated with the traditional
Social Security system. Specifically, an individual could sell claims on a ‚ÄúGNP
index‚Äù in an amount equal to his or her Social Security contributions, and could use
the proceeds to purchase other financial assets that were less highly correlated with
his/her nontraded human capital. In fact, the individual would ideally like to hedge
that component of labor income risk associated with aggregate risk (captured in the
model of Section 4 by the term  j SSW It in eq. (7)).
Absent the creation of these macro markets, individuals could still benefit from
Social Security reform that would allow the individual to choose the financial assets
in which contributions during the working lifetime would be invested. Individuals
would no longer be able to create hedges for Social Security risk, but at least they
could invest their Social Security ‚Äòcontributions‚Äô in assets whose returns were less
highly correlated with the returns on nontraded human capital. Our results for
disaggregated socio-economic groups suggest that women have the most to gain from
this type of Social Security reform, since the evidence shows that women‚Äôs labor
income growth is most closely related to changes in the SSWI. By contrast, men‚Äôs
15

labor income growth appears largely unrelated to SSWI growth, suggesting that men
may have less to gain from Social Security reform that permits investment in a broader
range of assets.

Notes:
1. All data from 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances, as summarized in Kennickell, et al. (1997).
2. Number of years of remaining working life generally assumed to be 23 years (midpoint of working
from age 20 to age 65). In the case of age groups, the number of years for an individual at the
midpoint of the age group is used.
3. Median income for the " income group" breakdown is the midpoint of the range, except for the
highest group (more than $100,000) where we have arbitrarily used the figure $200,000
as the median.
4. To calculate the ratio of the value of human capital to net worth, we capitalized current income
over the individual's remaining working life assuming that income rises at the rate g and using
a discount rate of r. This calculation assumes that current income consists of wage income
only, which may not be a good assumption for higher-income individuals. However, this error
will bias upward the human capital/net worth ratio for individuals with high net worth and thus
high non-wage income, thus reducing the disparity between high- and low-wage groups.
