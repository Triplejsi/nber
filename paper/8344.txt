1. Introduction
That wealthy people live longer and have lower morbidity, on average, than do poor people has
been well documented across countries, within countries at a point in time, and over time with
economic growth. The positive correlation between income and health is not limited to the bottom
end of the income distribution (Adler et al 1994). Indeed, the gradient in health status—the
phenomenon that relatively wealthier people have better health and longevity—is evident
throughout the income distribution. In this paper we present evidence that the income gradients
observed in adult health have antecedents in childhood, and suggest that part of the
intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status may work through the impact of parents’
long run average income on children’s health.
Using several large, nationally representative data sets, we find that children’s health is
positively related to household income, and that the relationship between household income and
children’s health status becomes more pronounced as children grow older. A large component of
the relationship between income and children’s health can be explained by the arrival and impact
of chronic health conditions in childhood. Children from lower-income households with chronic
health conditions have worse health than do children from higher-income households. Further, we
find that children’s health is closely associated with long-run average household income, and that
the adverse health effects of lower permanent income accumulate over children’s lives. These
children arrive at the doorstep of adulthood with lower health status and lower educational
attainment — the latter, in part, as a consequence of poor health.
Our findings are of interest not only because they provide insight into the determinants of
child well-being, but because they have implications for the sources of an income gradient in
adulthood health. Hypotheses on the causes of the relationship between income and health are
difficult to untangle in adulthood, and there is little consensus on the relative importance of
mechanisms that lead from low income to poor health and of those that lead from poor health to
low income. (Marmot 1999, Smith 1999, Fuchs 1982). By focusing on children, we can eliminate
1

the channel that runs from health to income. Generally in the United States children do not
contribute to family income, and so the correlation between poor health in childhood and low
family income cannot be explained by lower earnings of children (although it should be noted that
ill children could reduce parental labor supply, a point we address in what follows). This does not
imply that health status has no effect on income in adulthood. In fact, our results indicate that
children from poorer households enter adulthood in poorer general health, with more serious
chronic conditions, and having missed more days of school—all of which may compromise their
future earnings ability.
Wealthier parents may be better able to purchase medical care, nutritious foods, and safer
environments for their children and, in these and many other ways, income may have a causal
effect on children’s health. At the same time, children’s health may be influenced by a variety of
parental characteristics — including both genetic or behavioral factors — that are correlated with
parental income, and we find evidence for some ‘third factor’ explanations in our data.
We begin by establishing several facts about the relationship between children’s health and
household income. We then present a model of the evolution of children’s health status that is
consistent with the facts presented, and go on to test implications of the model. We then explore
the extent to which the relationship between income and health can be explained by other
characteristics of parents and the child’s environment, such as parental health and labor supply.
We conclude with a discussion of mechanisms that underlie the relationship between income and
health in childhood, and implications of this relationship for children’s human capital formation.

2. Data
In our analysis we use data from four sources: the annual National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS), the 1988 child health supplement to the NHIS (NHIS-CH), the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics with its associated 1997 Child Development Supplement (PSID-CDS), and the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
2

The NHIS is a cross-sectional survey that collects annual data on the health status and
chronic and acute medical conditions of a large nationally representative sample of American
adults and children. We pool NHIS data from 1986 to 1995, which yields roughly 62,000
observations for 1986, and 120,000 observations annually between 1987 and 1995. Our interest is
in understanding the relationship between family income and children’s health, and for this reason
we restrict our ‘core’ sample to all children aged 0 to 17 for whom household income is reported.
The NHIS contains information on total household income, presented by income band. We assign
incomes to these income categories using data from the 1986-1995 March Current Population
Surveys. (Detailed information on the sample and on the income assignment procedure is
provided in the Appendix.)
Summary statistics for our core NHIS sample of children are provided in column 1 of
Table 1. The children are on average 8.3 years old (we have roughly equal numbers at each age),
and are on average in very good or excellent health. Only 3 percent of them are reported to be in
only fair or poor health. Less than 2 percent of the children are living apart from a mother; 20
percent are living apart from a father. The sample is roughly 78 percent white and 15 percent
black.
The sample for the 1988 NHIS-CH consists of one child per family drawn from the 1988
NHIS. The respondents for these children were asked a wide variety of questions regarding the
child’s health. We use the NHIS-CH to examine issues related to the child’s health at birth and
the child’s health insurance coverage, for which there is no information in the core NHIS.
Most of our PSID data come from a Child Development Supplement that was conducted
in 1997, in which a battery of health-related questions was asked of (a maximum of) two children
aged 12 or under in all PSID households. Information was gathered on the children’s current
health status and their health status at birth. We supplement the 1997 data with information on
family income and their parents’ work histories and health status from earlier years of the PSID.

3

Summary statistics for the PSID sample are given in the second column of Table 1. The
PSID children are on average younger than the NHIS children (they range in age from 0 to 12,
instead of from 0 to 17). Their health is also generally very good or excellent. The PSID sample is
less white (52 percent) and more black (42 percent) than the NHIS. Part of our sample comes
from the PSID-SEO, which intentionally oversampled the poor.
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was conducted
between 1988 and 1994. As part of the survey, respondents were given an examination by a
physician, who was then asked to rate the individual’s general health status on a scale of 1
(excellent) to 5 (poor). We use data on 10,018 children aged 16 and under to compare the
relationship between family income and the doctor’s assessment of overall health with that
observed between family income and the child’s parent’s assessment measured on the same scale.
More details are provided in the Appendix. Sample statistics for the NHANES are shown in the
third column of Table 1. These (unweighted) means reflect the fact that the NHANES
oversampled young children from lower-income demographic groups: these children are younger
and poorer, with lower levels of adult education.

3. The income-gradient in children’s health status
We first look at the relationship between family income and overall health status, where health
status is a categorical variable with values 1=Excellent, 2=Very Good, 3=Good, 4=Fair, and
5=Poor. Finding appropriate measures of a child’s health status is a challenge. In developing
countries, infant mortality rates, anthropometric measures, and indicators for vaccination provide
a guide to child health. Using U.S. data, Korenman and Miller (1997) examine how the timing of
poverty is related to stunting, wasting, obesity, and several indicators of child development among
a sample of 5 to 7 year olds from the NLSY. However, in the U.S., stunting and wasting are quite
rare. For adults, a poor self-report of health is a powerful predictor of mortality, even when
controlling for physician assessed health status and health-related behaviors. Poor self-reports of
4

health are also a significant predictor of future changes in functioning among the elderly. (Idler
and Kasl 1995 presents results on changes in functioning, and an extensive set of references on
the studies of self reported health and mortality.) Much less is known about the predictive power
of reported poor health in children. In what follows, we find that this measure correlates strongly
with children’s chronic conditions, bed days, and hospitalization episodes.
The upper half of Figure 3.1 shows the conditional expectation of health status in the
NHIS as a function of the log of family income, for children by age group in the left-hand panel,
and for younger and older adults by age group in the right-hand panel. The bottom half shows
similar graphs for the PSID, although the samples of adults for the PSID consist of parents of the
children in the PSID-CDS and so are not representative of all adults in the United States. The
conditional expectations are calculated using a Fan (1992) locally weighted regression smoother,
which allows the data to determine the shape of the function, rather than imposing (for example) a
linear or quadratic form. The top left panel of Figure 3.1 presents results for children ages 0-3, 48, 9-12, and 13-17, and the right panel presents those same children 13-17, and compares them
with adults of different ages.1 The PSID uses the same age groupings for children (up to age 12),
and two groupings of parents, aged 25-34 and 35-44.
Immediately apparent in the left panel of Figure 3.1 is the inverse relationship between
family income and children’s health status for children of all ages. The correlation becomes
progressively more negative with age—a phenomenon that holds throughout childhood and
adulthood (note the change in scale between the panels). This steepening of the gradient with age
is observed until roughly age 65, a result consistent with the findings of other researchers. The
results for the PSID are similar to those for the NHIS.

1

The Fan regressions are weighted using sampling weights provided in the NHIS, and are
thus representative of the population as a whole. (Unweighted regression results are very similar.)
We do not include adults aged 18-24 in this second panel, because we are concerned about the
representativeness of this sample of college-aged individuals, and whether these respondents
report their current incomes or the incomes of the families in which they were raised.
5

Our findings contrast with those found by West (1997). Using the 1991 British Census,
West concludes that the gradient found among children disappears for youths (ages 11-19), only
to reappear in early adulthood (ages 20 and higher). We find that the gradient in reported health
status found in childhood becomes more pronounced as youths age, and no evidence that the
gradient vanishes in adolescence.
There are many other parental, household and child-specific characteristics that may vary
between households with 2 year olds (say) and households with 12 year olds. In order to control
for a range of other characteristics, we run ordered probits of health status (integers from
1=excellent to 5=poor) on income and on sets of household controls, and present the results in the
first four columns of Table 2 for the NHIS.2
We present two sets of results for each age group. The first row (labeled “NHIS Controls
1”) shows results of ordered probits of health status on the log of family income, with age
indicators, year indicators, and with controls for child and household characteristics, excluding
parents’ educations. (Details are given in the notes to the tables.) The next set of rows (“NHIS
Controls 2”) presents results in which, in addition to the variables in Controls 1, we include
controls for parents’ educations and unemployment status. The results in Table 2 show that the
negative relationship between income and health status becomes more pronounced and significant
for each older age group.
The addition of parents’ educational attainment to the set of controls has a large effect on
the estimated income coefficients, reducing them by roughly a third for all ages relative to results
using Controls 1. However, the gradients remain large and highly significant. Even with controls
for parents’ educations, a doubling of household income is associated with an increase in the
probability that a child is in excellent or very good health of 4.0 percent (for ages 0-3), 4.9

The results presented here are robust to estimating the models using ordinary least
squares, and to using an indicator that health is reported to be ‘excellent’ or ‘very good’ as the
dependent variable.
6

percent (ages 4-8), 5.9 percent (ages 9-12) and 7.2 percent (ages 13-17). (These results are not
reported in Table 2, but are available from the authors upon request.)
Although adding controls for education does not eliminate the effects of income, the
coefficients on parents’ educations are large and significant. Children living with a mother with a
high school degree are reported to be in better health than those whose mothers have not finished
high school (the omitted category here). Children whose mothers have more than a high school
degree are reported to be in even better health. A similar pattern is seen with respect to fathers’
educations. This may be because education makes parents more adept at protecting their
children’s health. Alternatively, education itself may not be causal, but may signify that the parent
is patient, and may be more nurturing. In either case, if parents’ educations are omitted, their
effects may load onto the income coefficient, with which they are highly correlated.3
Distinct from the pattern we observed for income, we see little change in the impact of
parents’ educations on children’s health status between younger and older ages. Both mothers’
and fathers’ educations have a slightly stronger impact for children above age 3; the coefficient on
the indicator that mother has more than a high school degree, for example, jumps from –.244 to
–.322 between age groups 0 to 3 and 4 to 8. However, a comparison of the education coefficients
for children aged 4 to 8, 9 to 12 and 13 to 17 show that the relationship between parents
educations and childrens’ health remain constant above age 3. That there is a steepening gradient

3

Another explanation is that household income is measured with error, and the ‘true’
household income may be correlated with parents’ educations, leading to large (or larger)
coefficients on parents’ educations, as the education coefficients pick up part of the effect of
‘true’ income. We have explored whether measurement error in income is important in our
analysis, by instrumenting the log of family income on indicators for industry, occupation and
class of worker in the household. For each age group and each specification, the instrumented
coefficients show a stronger effect of income on health status, increasing the size of the
coefficients in absolute value between twenty five and fifty percent. Other than its effect on the
sizes of the coefficients, instrumentation does little to the pattern of coefficients observed here:
the gradients for older children continue to be steeper than those for younger children.
Instrumentation does reduce the estimated effects of mother’s and father’s educations, but their
coefficients remain large and significant.
7

of health with respect to income with age, but no steepening with respect to parents’ educations,
is noteworthy. It appears that income (and what it buys a child) has a different effect on a child’s
health from the skills that accompany parental education.
One potential objection to the use of parents’ reports of their children’s health status is
that they are not objective, and may be colored by the parent’s own health status. Such a finding
would be inconsistent with Dadds et al (1995), who present evidence that maternal mental health
does not influence mothers’ reports of child health. We provide three additional pieces of
evidence on this issue. First, we look at 17-year-olds in the NHIS, who were given the option of
reporting on their own health. Specifically, we reproduced the results shown in the top panel of
Table 2, adding both an indicator for whether the 17-year-olds responded for themselves and an
interaction term of the logarithm of income with this indicator. In no case was the effect of either
of the added variables significantly different from zero.
In addition, because the NHANES contains both physician-assessed and parent-assessed
health status, we can evaluate whether the gradient we observe using parent-assessed health, and
the rotation of this gradient with age, are due to a reporting bias that varies systematically with
income. The bottom panel of Table 2 presents coefficients of log family income in ordered probits
of parent-assessed health (columns 1 to 4), and physician-assessed health (columns 5 to 8). For
both, we find a significant correlation between income and children’s health status, with larger
effects for older children. The coefficients on income for physician-assessed health are smaller in
absolute value than those for parent-assessed health, possibly because physicians use a smaller
range of the health scale than do parents. That the income gradient in physician-assessed health
status also rotates with children’s ages (at least through age 12) suggests that the rotation we see
in parent-assessed health is not the result of reporting bias.
A third way of evaluating the gradients we find using parent reports of children’s health is
to compare them with those we find for other health related outcomes. The last four NHIS
columns of Table 2 report the gradients we observe for the number of days the child has spent in
8

bed and the number of hospitalization episodes in the past 12 months, and the number of school
days missed and days of restricted activity in the past 2 weeks. For all four of these measures of
children’s health status we find large and significant effects of family income. These, then, provide
additional evidence that either income is itself protective of children’s health, or is correlated with
things that are protective of children’s health. Perhaps both.
We finish our initial presentation of the facts by examining whether there are gradients in
the medical conditions that children contract. We selected a set of 14 potentially serious health
conditions on which the NHIS collects information, leaving aside conditions that are not
associated with children (e.g. emphysema, arthritis, cirrhosis of the liver.) Most of the conditions
we consider are “chronic” in the sense that the fraction of children who have these conditions
increases with age. Exceptions are digestive disorders, which are most common among very
young children, and bronchitis. Detailed information on these conditions is provided in the
Appendix. Figure 3.2 parallels Figure 3.1, and shows non-parametric regressions of an indicator
of having a medical condition on the log of family income for children in different age groups. We
have graphed 9 of the 14 conditions to illustrate the diversity of relationships between specific
medical conditions and income. The vertical lines in the figures are placed at the 25th, 50th and 75th
percentiles of income.
Many of the conditions are more prevalent at lower incomes for all age groups. These
include digestive disorders, hearing problems, heart conditions, epilepsy, and mental retardation.
Others display a negative relationship between prevalence and income for some but not all ages.
For example, there is a negative association between asthma and income for children aged 8 and
under, but not for older children. This result is consistent with Halfon and Newacheck (1993),
who find that the difference in the prevalence of asthma across children above and below the
poverty line is largest for young children. However, our results indicate that the negative
association between asthma and income for younger children is not driven solely by a higher

9

prevalence of asthma among children in poverty: the negatively sloped gradient is apparent up
through the 50th percentile of income, well above the poverty line.
The next section presents a model of children’s health status that is consistent with the
preliminary findings of this section: that, on average, children’s health becomes poorer with age;
that, on average, the differences in the health of wealthier and poorer children become more
pronounced with age; and that, on average, the probability of developing a severe chronic
condition is inversely related to income.

4. A model of cumulative health status
In this section we build a model in which incomes have cumulative effects on health. Health
stocks depends on both the accumulation of medical conditions and the effort and money parents
spend to prevent the deterioration in their children’s health when they become ill. The model has
implications that are consistent with our previous results — both that older children on average
are reported to have poorer health, and that the gradient in health steepens with age—and also has
a variety of other testable implications that we examine below.
We assume, to begin, that all children are born into excellent health status, h  , and that
children’s health erodes only as they receive health shocks, which arrive in the form of chronic
conditions. If a child never contracts a chronic condition, then the child’s health will remain at the
highest level. (Below we relax the assumption that all children have identical, excellent health
status at birth. We can also allow for non-chronic health shocks that do not persist over time, such
as common colds or stomach viruses, that might temporarily reduce reported health status.)
Chronic conditions accumulate over time. We define ct to be an index of the number and
severity of chronic conditions a child has. Each period, c can increase, either because the child
receives a new chronic condition or an existing chronic condition worsens. A simple (discrete)
process for the accumulation of chronic conditions is:
ct  ct1  d t .
10

(1)

where dt is an integer that ranges from 0 to D, such that each value has a probability of occurring
D

of pd, where j pd  1 . In this specification, chronic conditions can increase but not decrease
d 0

over time. It is sensible but not necessary to assume that pd decreases in d. Consistent with the
evidence presented in Figure 3.2, we assume that the probabilities pd are a decreasing function of
income.
A child’s stock of health h evolves through time. Chronic conditions c erode the child’s
health stock by an amount δ(c)h , where the fraction of health stock lost to illness each period
δ(c) depends upon the number and severity of conditions. Without proper treatment, a child with
asthma, for example, is at greater risk of developing respiratory viral infections, which may in turn
lead to lower health status. We assume children with no chronic conditions experience no erosion
in their health stock: δ(c0)0 .
To a greater or lesser extent, depreciation in the child’s health stock may be offset by
household (parental) investments in the child’s health. Here we assume that investments can be
characterized as investments per unit of the child’s current health e(y,h)h , where the investment is
a function of the child’s current health status and the family’s income y . For the moment we leave
open the question of what income measure is most relevant to a child’s health investments —
current income or long-run average income are both plausible candidates. Such investments may
take many forms. For example, the parents of a child with asthma may invest time and effort in
helping to develop and monitor a medical protocol that works for their child; they may keep the
child’s medications up to date, and his or her inhaler in working order. Parents may also change
their own behaviors, perhaps refraining from smoking near the child, or ensuring that dust mites
aren’t aggravating the child’s condition. As written here, the investment function includes both
medical services purchased and health-related behaviors (nutrition, smoking, exercise).
The two critical assumptions we make about the investment function are that, at any given
level of health stock, wealthier parents are willing (able) to invest more, so that Me(y,h)/My > 0 ,
and that all parents are willing to invest more when a child’s health becomes poorer, so that
11

Me(y,h)/Mh < 0 . We also assume that as long as children are observed in excellent health, no
investment is made in their health: e(y,h )  0. Figure 4.1 displays a configuration of the
relationship between a child’s health and the health investment for the wealthiest household in the
survey, 
y , and the poorest household in the survey, y . We have drawn health investments to be

linear in the child’s health stock, but the exact shape of the investment profile is not essential.

below this level, children die: facing these conditions with the investment parents can afford to

Figure 4.1 shows the steady state values for children with the same number of conditions
from the wealthiest and poorest households. Holding income constant, children with more chronic
conditions are less healthy. Holding the number of conditions constant, children with less income
are less healthy. The model predicts that, for any non-zero level of chronic conditions, say c1 , the

steady state health level for poor children will be below that for rich children, h(y ,c1) < h(y

as in Figure 4.1.
We illustrate the health dynamics implied by this model with the following example.
Suppose a rich child and a poor child of the same age both developed a chronic condition, c1 , at
time t . The model predicts that at t1 the health of both children will have deteriorated
somewhat, because the families do not spend resources on the children’s health when the children
are in excellent health, and it takes time for the condition to erode health status. But once the
erosion is observed, the wealthy family is able to bring more resources to bear to shore up the
health of their child. The wealthy family may be able to stem the deterioration in the child’s health
status at time t1 , while the poor family may observe additional deterioration until t2 (or
perhaps beyond), until the child reaches a health level h such that e(y ,h)  δ(c) . The rich and

poor child, when observed in cross section, would be presented with identical health status at time

This is shown in Figure 4.2, where the health status of a rich child and a poor child are
graphed against age. The status of both children are shown after a health shock at age 0
(time t ). The gradient in these children’s health status appears only after age 1 (time t1 ), when
the differences in the treatment they receive for their chronic conditions begins to be reflected in
their health. If at age 3 these children were both to develop a second chronic condition, erosion of
their health from their current levels brings more resources to bear, and again the wealthy family
stems the erosion with less loss of health than does the poor family. If the slope of the expenditure
function with respect to health is steeper for the wealthy family than for the poor family at these

The model has a variety of implications for the relationship between health, chronic
conditions, and income:

(i) Children who suffer from no conditions remain in excellent health but, given the stochastic
arrival of chronic conditions, on average the health of children will deteriorate with age.
As conditions accumulate over time, erosion becomes a larger problem ( δ (c) is higher), and
health worsens on average with age for children at any income level. This implication hinges on
the assumption that chronic conditions can only accumulate over time. It could be reversed if
children were able to recover from some serious adverse health conditions.

(ii) Observed in the cross section, the gradient in the health-income relationship is steeper for
older children than for younger children.
Shallower gradients for younger children appear for two related reasons. First, the probability of
receiving a chronic condition is higher for poorer children, and the accumulation of these
conditions over time will manifest itself in a steeper gradient. In addition, the erosion of poor
children’s health stock, after the arrival of a chronic condition, takes time. As shown in Figure
4.2, a poor child at age 1 with chronic condition c1 is in better health than he will be at age 2 (the
point in time when the erosion in his health elicits a large enough resource response to maintain
his health at a particular level).

(iii) The impact of a health shock on children’s health stock should depend upon the severity of
the chronic condition contracted. For any given chronic condition, the children from wealthier
families have a higher health stock and, if M2e(y,h)/MhMy < 0 at all h and y, so that the slope of
the investment function with respect to health is always steeper for wealthier families, then the
difference in the health of rich and poor children will increase with the severity of the condition.

15

As in Figure 4.1, at any value of c, children from wealthier families will have better health
outcomes than will children from poorer families. Increases in c, which shift δ(c) up, will have a
larger adverse effect on poor children than rich children.
In Section 5, we examine these implications of the model using data on children’s health
from the NHIS and the PSID. We also return to the question of whether current or long run
income is more relevant for children’s health status.

5. Evidence on chronic conditions, income and cumulative health status
For the purposes of testing the model laid out in Section 4, the NHIS and the PSID have different
strengths. The NHIS has the advantage of being large, which is crucial for analyzing chronic
conditions that are relatively rare. However, the NHIS is not a panel, and thus we cannot track
parents, children or income through time. Because the PSID is a panel, we can use household
incomes from all periods of a child’s life to assess whether it is long run or current income that
has the larger effect on health. We will make use of these data sets to test aspects of the model
presented in Section 4.

a. Chronic conditions, income and health
The model predicts that the effect of a chronic condition on children’s health stock should depend
upon the severity of the chronic condition and, for any given chronic condition, children from
wealthier families should have higher health stocks. In addition, if the slope of the investment
function with respect to health is everywhere steeper for wealthier families, then the difference in
the health of rich and poor children should increase with the severity of the condition.
To test these implications of the model, we regress an indicator of poor health on an
indicator for the presence of a chronic condition, the log of family income, and the log of family
income interacted with the indicator for the presence of that condition. Results of these
regressions are presented in Table 3, where each row of the table presents results for a single
16

chronic condition for 3 samples: all children, younger children (ages 0-8) and older children (ages
9-17).4 The last row shows results that use the full sample of children, using an indicator of
whether the child had any of the 14 medical conditions.
Columns 2, 4 and 6 provide estimates of the change in the probability of reporting poor
health with each condition, evaluated at median household income. The results show that
conditions we would a priori label as more severe have the largest effect on children’s health
status: at median household income, the probability of poor health increases by 9 percent with
asthma; 15 percent with diabetes; 21 percent with epilepsy; 19 percent with kidney disease; and
10 percent with mental retardation. Conditions we would a priori label as less severe have the
smallest effect on children’s health: at median household income the probability of poor health
increases by 1 percent with hay fever and 2 percent with sinusitis.
For any given chronic condition, children from wealthier families have higher health
stocks. This can be seen by inspection of columns 3, 5 and 7 of Table 3. For every condition, the
interaction term between income and the chronic condition is negative and significant, with the
exception of kidney disease. Children from wealthier families observed with chronic conditions are
healthier than their counterparts in poorer families.
The gradient in health is largest for the most severe chronic conditions. That is, the
protective effect of income is largest for the conditions that cause the greatest erosion to
children’s health status. The largest interaction terms are observed for asthma (–.048), diabetes
(–.139), and epilepsy (–.077) — three of the chronic conditions that lead to the largest average

4

We cannot include measures of all conditions in a single regression because families in the
NHIS are assigned to one of 6 “condition lists” and provide information only on conditions
covered by their assigned list. We used the NHIS-CH, which provides information on a large set
of children’s health conditions, to estimate a model that included a set of conditions and their
interactions with income in a single regression. Because the sample is small and many conditions
are rare, the coefficients were less precisely estimated than those shown in Table 3, but the
general pattern of results is the same.
17

deterioration of health status. (The only exception here is kidney disease, where the condition has
a large and significant effect on health status, but income appears not to be protective.)
The model presented in Section 4 also predicts that the effect of income on health upon
the arrival of a chronic condition should be larger, the longer the child had suffered from the
chronic condition. In the NHIS we do not have information about the onset date of chronic
conditions. However, we can examine the impact of the condition, and its interaction, at different
ages observed in cross-section. If we assume that the deterioration of health status is cumulative,
we would expect, even without information about the date of onset of particular conditions, that
older children should experience more detrimental health outcomes due to chronic conditions, the
lower is household income. We examine this hypothesis by estimating separate models for
younger (aged 0 to 8) and older (aged 9 to 17) children. The results are in the last 4 columns of
Table 3. Consistent with the model, we find that income is more protective of children’s health
status at older ages for almost every condition presented.
We take the results in Table 3 as evidence in support of the model’s implication that
chronic conditions interact with income and, in doing so, create a gradient in children’s health. A
second set of results consistent with this implication is provided in Table 4, where the number of
bed days lost to illness and the number of hospitalization stays are used as alternative measures of
poor health. The left panel of Table 4 presents results of regressions where the number of bed
days is regressed against an indicator that the child has particular conditions, the log of family
income, the log of family income interacted with these conditions. The first column in the panel
presents the marginal effect of the condition on bed days, evaluated at median household income.
The right panel provides an analogous set of results for hospitalization episodes.
Both panels provide evidence that income protects children with chronic conditions.
Asthma provides a useful example. We find that the association between asthma and bed days and
hospitalization at the 25th percentile of income is much greater than that at the 75th percentile of
income: at the 25th percentile (a log income level of 9.5) children with asthma spend 5.6 more
18

days in bed than do children without asthma, and have 0.12 more hospital episodes, relative to 3.8
more bed days and 0.05 more hospital episodes for a child at the 75th percentile of income. The
final row of the table indicates that having at least one of the 14 chronic conditions is associated
with significantly more bed days and hospitalization episodes, and that these effects are larger for
poorer children.

b. Current versus permanent income
The model in Section 4 left open the question of whether the timing of income over a child’s life
affects a child’s health. One possibility is that investment decisions are made based on long run
average income, in which case the timing is not important. Another possibility, which has been
discussed in the child development literature, is that the effect of income depends on the age of
the child when the income was received (Duncan et al. 1997). We use data from the PSID to
examine whether the timing of income matters, exploiting the fact that we have information on the
family’s income throughout the child’s lifetime (and indeed from the period before the child was
born). The first panel of Table 5 presents the results of ordered probits of health status on the log
of average income in different periods of life (ages 0 to 3, 4 to 8, 9 to 12), and on the log of
average income in the household in the six years before the child was born. Each column of Panel
A presents the results of a different ordered probit.
We see in Table 5 that family income in the years before the child is born and those at
different ages of life are all equally correlated with a child’s current health status. Family income
prior to the child’s birth is significantly correlated with the child’s current health, for children of
all ages (columns 1, 4 and 8 of Panel A). Moreover, the coefficient on income prior to birth for
children aged 0 to 3 (–.137) is not significantly different from that on income during the years
when the child is aged 0 to 3 (–.160). The same pattern is seen for older children: the coefficient
on income prior to birth for children aged 9 to 12 (–.176) is not significantly different from that
on income during ages 0 to 3 (–.199), ages 4 to 8 (–.195), or ages 9 to 12 (–.236).
19

These results are consistent with the hypothesis that long run average income determines
health investments and health status at different ages. If this is true, the coefficients on income
when the child was aged 0 to 3, for children now aged 4 or above, cannot be interpreted as the
impact of income arriving during ages 0 to 3. For these older children, the coefficient on income
from earlier ages (and indeed that before birth) just provides us with an estimate of the impact of
permanent income on children’s health at their current age.
We cannot reject that income at different ages have equal effects on a child’s health status,
and in the last three panels we impose their equality. We estimate ordered probits of health status
on the log of average income for all years the child has been alive (birth year to 1997) in Panel B;
on the log of average income from the six years prior to birth through 1997, in Panel C; and on
the log of average income from the nine years prior to birth through 1997, in Panel D. Using
income since birth, we find a significant relationship between income and health status that
becomes more pronounced at older ages (the coefficient increases from –0.160 for the youngest
children to –0.253 for children aged 4 to 8, to –.297 for children aged 9 to 12). When we use
income from six years prior to birth through to current age, these coefficients become larger in
absolute value (–.182, –.257 –.344); our measure of permanent income becomes less noisy when
we use these additional years of data. The coefficient estimates change very little with additional
lags beyond that point (see the results when we add lags of income for seven to nine years before
birth in Panel D). We take the evidence in Table 5 to suggest that children’s health status is
correlated with the household’s permanent income, and that the impact of permanent income on a
child’s health status becomes larger, the older is the child.
The evidence in Tables 3 through 5 is consistent with the model put forward in Section 4.
Children from families with lower incomes are at risk for worse health outcomes. The differences
manifest themselves over time in childhood, and appear to work, at least in part, through chronic
conditions.

20

6. Extensions and alternative explanations
The results presented in Section 5 are consistent with a model in which permanent income affects
children’s health status through its effect on parental management of children’s chronic
conditions. However, they do not rule out many third factor explanations, such as a lasting effect
of poor health at birth, or a spurious correlation between children’s health and household income
that derives from poor parental health. We evaluate these and other potential explanations in this
section.

a. Health at birth
The model in section 4 includes the assumption that all children are born in excellent health. In
fact, health at birth varies across children. Some children are born with health problems, such as
prematurity, low birth weight for gestational age, or congenital birth defects.
There are several reasons to think that heterogeneity in health at birth could account for at
least some of our earlier findings. First, it may be that children born to poorer women are at
greater risk of being born with health problems, possibly due to poorer prenatal care, higher rates
of maternal smoking that accompany lower income levels, or other maternal or environmental
characteristics associated with low income. Poor birth health could therefore produce a gradient
in health among very young children. Second, if poorer children are born with the most severe
health problems, ones that require a longer recovery period or that result in chronic conditions,
then the gap in health between rich and poor children might increase with age, as wealthier
children who are born in poor health recover whereas poorer children who are born in poor health
do not. Finally, holding constant the severity of health problems at birth, wealthier children may
recover faster because their parents spend more on their care.
For policy purposes, it is important to examine whether health at birth accounts for a
large part of the gradient between health and income in childhood. If so, it implies that equalizing
the quality of prenatal health care and working to improve maternal health behaviors in the
21

prenatal period may go a long way toward eliminating the gradients we observe throughout
childhood.
Adding heterogeneity in health at birth does not fundamentally alter the model developed
above. Health at birth can be broken into a component that is chronic, so that children can be born
with different values of c, and a component that is transitory, so that given c children can be born
with non-steady state health levels below h*. In this case, the model works as described above,
with the only addition that children with transitory health problems at birth move, after the birth,
to the steady state-level that coincides with their family income level and value of c.
We use data from the NHIS to examine whether health at birth accounts for the
relationship between current health and current income. The core NHIS collects no information
on health at birth. However, the NHIS-CH supplement collects information for one child per
family on the child’s birth weight and the number of nights the child spent in the hospital after the
birth. In Table 6, we show results of order probits of current health status on poor health at birth,
including interactions of poor birth health with age and income. We use, as an indicator of poor
health at birth, that a child spent one week or longer in the hospital after birth and/or that the child
was born at very low birth weight (less than 3.5 pounds). This assigns poor birth health to ten
percent of our sample. (Results are similar using different cutoffs for poor birth health.)
The results indicate that poor birth health has larger adverse effects on children at low
income levels, and that improvements with age are slower for poorer children. Column 2 shows
that poor health at birth is positively related to poor health later in life, but that the effects of poor
health at birth diminish with age. The addition of controls for poor health at birth has very little
effect on the health-income gradient, or on our estimate of the rotation of the gradient with age.
Results in column 2 also suggest that the adverse effects of poor health at birth on current health
dissipate with age.5 The third column includes an interaction of health at birth and income, and
5

This is consistent with the findings of McCormick et al. (1993) but somewhat at odds
with those of Currie and Hyson (1998).Currie and Hyson, using data from the British National
22

indicates that poor birth health has a larger adverse effect on poorer children. In the fourth
column, we examine the hypothesis that higher income children recover from poor health at birth
more quickly than do poorer children, by including an interaction of age, poor health at birth, and
income. (The birth health/income interaction is omitted, which imposes the implicit restriction that
poor health at birth has identical effects on health status for poor and rich children at age 0.) The
parameter estimate for this interaction term is negative and marginally significant, indicating that
the adverse effects of health at birth on current health decline more quickly with age for wealthier
children. The final column shows results of an ordered probit that include a complete set of
interactions of poor health at birth with age, income, and income times age. The parameter
estimates are consistent with the hypothesis that wealthier children are less affected by poor health
at birth, and recover more quickly. However, although the “health at birth” variables are jointly
significant, with this number of interactions the individual parameters are not estimated precisely.
Most important for our analysis, adding controls for birth health does not alter the basic finding
that lower income is associated with worse health. Health at birth does not account for the
income gradient in childhood health.

b. Parental health as a determinant of children’s health
Children’ health may also be affected by the health status of their parents, possibly through an
inherited susceptibility to different diseases, a less healthy uterine environment, or lower quality
care by sick parents. In addition, the health of parents and children might be affected by common
but unmeasured environmental factors, resulting in a correlation between their health levels. It is
also possible that parental health is a “third factor” that accounts for the income gradient in
children’s health: an income gradient in children’s health might be observed if parents in poor

Child Development Survery (1958 birth cohort) find a significant effect of low birth weight on the
probability a woman reports fair or poor health at age 23, but not at age 33, and a significant
effect of low birth weight on the probability that men report fair or poor health at age 33, but not
at age 23. It is possible that advances since 1958 in the medical treatment of low-birth-weight
infants has altered the long-term effects of low birth weight.
23

health have lower earnings, and poor health is transmitted from parents to children — producing a
spurious correlation between income and children’s health.
This line of reasoning might suggest that equations of the form shown in Table 2 should
include controls for parental health. However, doing so has several potential pitfalls. If the health
of parents is affected by their income levels (as is argued in much of the literature on
socioeconomic status and health), and income is measured with error, then the “effects” of
parental health may simply reflect the effects of income. In addition, if the health of both parents
and children are affected by current and lagged values of income, the parental health may serve as
a proxy for the income levels experienced by children at earlier ages. For both of these reasons,
we cannot cleanly separate the effects of parent’s health and family income on children’s health.
Mindful of these problems, we estimate models identical to those in the lower panel of
Table 2 but with additional controls for mothers’ and fathers’ health status, to see whether this
eliminates the income gradient in health or the steepening of the gradient with age. The results are
shown in Table 7. The top panel presents results for the NHIS in which indicator variables are
included for whether the child’s mother and father are in excellent or very good health. The
bottom panel presents analogous results for the PSID. Because the PSID is a panel, we can also
test whether results are more robust when using long run average income, in place of current
income. There are several key findings. First, there are large “effects” of parent’s health on
children’s health. For example, if a child aged 0-3 has a mother in very good or excellent health,
his or her chance of also being in very good or excellent health rises by 27% (estimate not
reported in Table 7). The corresponding increase associated with having a father in very good or
excellent health is 16%. Second, mother’s health is more strongly associated with children’s
health than is father’s health, which is consistent with the idea that women in worse health bear
less healthy children, or that poor health in women makes them less able care givers.6

6

We also estimated regressions with a complete set of dummies for parental health (along
a 5-point scale). There is a non-monotonic relationship between mother’s health status and that of
24

Third, the inclusion of controls for parents’ health reduces the coefficients on family
income. For children in the oldest age group, the coefficient on family income in an ordered probit
of health status declines from –.218 when no health variables are included (lower panel of Table
2), to –.125 when indicators of whether parent’s health is excellent or very good are included.
However, these estimates are still large and highly significant. In addition, the gradients in income
still increase substantially with the age of the child, whereas the gradients in parental health do
not. Controlling for parental health status does not eliminate the rotation of the gradient with age.

The results in the lower panel, using the PSID, provide evidence that some of the decline
in the coefficients for family income may be because parental health is a proxy for permanent or
long-run income. As was true for the NHIS, when controls for parental health are added, the
coefficients on current family income decline (columns 1, 3 and 5.) However, when long run
income is substituted for current income, the coefficients on family income return to values that
are similar to those in Table 5. Although parental health (and especially maternal health) is
associated with child health, it does not account for the relationship between long-run income and
child health.

c. Genetic ties
The powerful connection between parents’ health status and children’s health status leads us to
ask whether permanent income is simply proxying for a genetic tie between parents and children.
A simple genetic story is that parents who are healthier have healthier children, and also earn more
money because of their better health endowments. We use information on adoptive versus
biological parents (available in the NHIS-CH) to test this hypothesis. Provided that wealthier
adoptive parents are not in a position to select healthier infants, we should find a significant

children aged 0 to 3: as one moves from “fair” to “poor” health of the mother, the child’s health
status improves. Perhaps when mother’s health is especially poor fathers play a bigger role in
children’s health provision.
25

income gradient in the health of birth children, but little gradient in the health of adopted children,
if a simple genetic story is driving our results. Panel A of Table 8 shows estimates of ordered
probits identical to those in Table 2 (using Controls 2), but on the smaller NHIS-CH sample. As
before, we find an income gradient in health that increases with age. The ordered probits in Panel
B add a complete set of indicators for family type: birth mother and father, birth mother and other
father, birth mother only, other mother only, other mother and birth father, birth father only, other
father only, or two non-birth parent, and each of these controls interacted with the log of family
income. We present in the table the coefficients for two polar cases: the income effect for a child
living with both birth parents, and the income effect for a child living with two non-birth parents.
For no age group is there a significant difference in the impact of income based on parental type
and, for three of the four age groups, the impact of income is larger for children living with nonbirth parents. We cannot reject equality of the eight income×parental type coefficients for any age
group. These results cast doubt on the simple genetic story.

d. Health and health insurance
The model in section 4 predicts that parental investments, interacting with accumulated chronic
conditions, are key determinants of childhood health status. If investment is comprised mainly of
medical expenditure, then access to health insurance might be an important determinant of health
status.7 Our finding that poorer children have worse health given specific chronic conditions could
be due to poorer children having no insurance coverage, or insurance coverage that pays for
lower quality care.
The NHIS-CH contains information on whether the child was covered by Medicaid or
other health insurance, and we use these data to examine whether the relationships between
income, chronic conditions, and health status are altered when we include controls for insurance.

7

Although not all children with insurance receive identical medical care. For example,
Currie and Thomas (1995) find significant differences in doctors visits for illness between white
and black children covered by Medicaid.
26

Table 9 shows ordered probit estimates of health status on income, controlling for whether the
child has had one of a number of medical conditions included in the 1988 NHIS child health
supplement (listed in the footnote to the table), interactions of income and the condition measure,
and controls for insurance. The second column indicates that children with insurance—either
private insurance or Medicaid—are in significantly better health. The point estimate indicates that
in the absence of any medical conditions, being insured has the same effect on health status as a
54% increase in income. However, adding the insurance measure does not alter the estimated
effects of income on health. The third column adds an interaction of the indicators for whether
the child is insured and whether he or she has an adverse medical condition. This coefficient
should be negative if families with insurance are better equipped to deal with medical problems.
Instead, it is positive and imprecisely estimated.
This anomalous result could be due to the fact that the insurance measure includes
Medicaid, and a child on Medicaid may have worse health for a variety of other reasons. (The
parents of poor children may learn that their children are eligible for Medicaid only when the
children are sick and presented for treatment.) In the fourth column we add an indicator for
whether the child receives Medicaid, and an interaction of Medicaid with the condition indicator.
We find that adding these controls for Medicaid does not alter the previous finding that insurance
does nothing to improve the health of children with adverse medical conditions. In addition, the
results indicate that children who are insured and receive Medicaid have worse health status than
those who have private insurance, and the hypothesis that the net effect of medicaid on health is
zero (given no adverse medical conditions) cannot be rejected.8 Children who receive Medicaid
and have a medical condition have significantly worse health status than those with no insurance
and a medical condition (F-statistic=4.41, p-value=.04). It seems implausible that Medicaid
actually damages children’s health (see Currie and Gruber 1996 on the beneficial impact of
Medicaid expansions on infant mortality rates) and we think the more likely explanation for this

8

The net effect of having Medicaid when there are no adverse health conditions is –.1171
+ .0754 = –.0417. The F-statistic for the test that this effect equals zero is .79 (p-value=.38).
27

result is that Medicaid is correlated with unmeasured family characteristics that are related to poor
health outcomes. For our purposes, the important finding is that controlling for insurance does not
substantially alter the estimated effects of income on health.

e. Children’s health and maternal labor supply
Another possible explanation for the income gradient in children’s health is that the parents of
less-healthy children reduce their labor supply, producing a positive correlation between low
income and poor health. Our earlier results suggest that this is unlikely to provide a complete
explanation of our findings: incomes from before the child was born were seen to have as strong
an effect on children’s health status in the PSID as income in any period of a child’s life. In the
NLSY, children observed in low income families in the initial period were significantly more likely
to experience a decline in health status between interviews. We provide additional evidence here,
using data from the PSID to examine the impact of a child’s poor health at birth on subsequent
maternal labor supply. We look at maternal labor supply during the first three years of a child’s
life, since our earlier results indicate that poor health at birth carries over into poor health in this
time period. The PSID has information on whether the child was born at low weight (5.5 pounds
or less) or spent time in a neonatal intensive care unit, which we use to construct an indicator of
poor health at birth.
Table 10 shows regressions of an indicator of mothers’ employment status (top panel) and
hours worked (bottom panel) on the indicator of the child’s health at birth. These results provide
strong evidence that poor health at birth does not affect maternal labor supply. Mothers of infants
with health problems are not significantly less likely to work in the first three years of the child’s
life, and do not have significantly fewer work hours. In the first regression on each panel, the
coefficient on the indicator of poor health at birth is typically positive, although not significantly
different from zero. The second column of each panel indicates that whether a woman worked in
the year prior to the birth is an important determinant of whether and how much a mother works
in the first three years after the birth. However, as indicated in the third column of each panel, of

28

mothers who worked prior to the child’s birth, there is no significant difference in work status and
work hours of those who did and did not have a child with poor health at birth. Our conclusion is
that the positive relationship between income and health in childhood is not due to the poor health
of children reducing family income.

7. Conclusions: mechanisms and implications
We have shown that the relationship between income and health status observed for adults has
antecedents in childhood. A family’s long-run average income is a powerful determinant of
children’s health status, one that works in part to protect children’s health upon the arrival of
chronic conditions. The health of children from families with lower incomes erodes faster with
age, and these children enter adulthood with both lower socioeconomic status and poorer health.
An important priority for future research is to identify the mechanisms that underlie the
relationship between income and children’s health. We have been able to rule out several possible
mechanisms: insurance does not play a crucial role in protecting health upon the arrival of a
chronic condition, health in childhood does not appear to be a persistent reflection of health at
birth, and a simple genetic model cannot explain the association between health and income.
Several additional avenues warrant further investigation. One is to examine the
relationship between family income, parental health behaviors, and children’s health. Table 11
presents preliminary results of ordered probits in which a child’s health status is modeled as a
function of the log of family income and a number of health behaviors, including whether the child
has a regular bedtime, whether someone in the household smokes, whether the child wears a
seatbelt all or most of the time, whether the child has a place for routine medical care and a place
for sick care, and whether the child has had a routine doctor’s visit in the past year. Jointly, these
variables are highly correlated with children’s health status. However, they do not affect the
coefficient on log income, perhaps because the gradient shows the cumulative effect of such
behaviors over a lifetime, and not just at a point in time. Some of these behaviors — particularly
regular bedtimes and wearing seatbelts — are highly correlated with children’s health status. It
seems unlikely that seatbelt use directly affects the child’s health (short of having an accident), but
29

that both seatbelt use and regular bedtimes are correlated with stability in household life. Future
work will focus on factors that we can not examine in the data sets here, but which may be related
— including such parental behaviors as staying home with children when the children are sick,
getting them to a doctor in a timely fashion when they fall ill, and overseeing the children’s meals
on a daily basis. The link between income, nutrition, and children’s health outcomes may also
prove to be important.
The results in this paper highlight the role of chronic conditions in the relationship
between income and health. It may be that higher-income parents are better able to manage
chronic health problems. For example, socioeconomic status has been implicated as a determinant
of adherence to and compliance with treatments for childhood epilepsy (Snodgrass et al. 2001)
and diabetes (Thompson et al. 2001, Davis et al. 2001).
What are the implications of poor health in childhood? In addition to the direct welfare
and financial costs of illness, poor childhood health results in lower levels of human capital
accumulation. Less healthy children spend more days in bed and miss more school. In addition, we
use the NHIS-CH to show that childhood illness results in children falling behind in school,
especially for children who are poor. Table 12 presents regressions of years of completed
education on a complete set of age dummies, income, whether the child has one of the medical
conditions defined in the footnote to table 9, and interactions of income and the condition
indicator. The first three columns show results for children aged 5 to 17. These results indicate
that having a condition reduces years of education, but that it does so less for children with higher
incomes. In addition, the greater adverse effect of having a medical condition for poorer children
grow larger as the child becomes older. This is shown in column 3, where the coefficient on the
interaction term between income, age, and the condition indicator is positive. It can also be seen
from the final two columns that show separate results for 5 to 11 year-olds and 12 to 17 yearolds: the positive effect of income on education when a condition is present is more than 4 times
larger for the older age group. Poorer children arrive at the doorstep of adulthood with lower
health status and with less education. It is an open question whether these factors result in lower
earnings as adults — contributing to the gradients observed in adulthood.

Appendix
National Health Interview Survey 1986-1995
The NHIS asks a knowledgeable household member to report on the health status and health conditions of
children aged 0 to 17. Each household was randomly assigned to answer questions from one of six
“conditions lists,” and information was collected on whether each household member had experienced each
of the medical conditions on the assigned condition list. (The NHIS was substantially redesigned after
1995, which limits us to the period 1986-1995.)
We start with 314455 children aged 0 to 17, and drop 43707 cases (14 percent) for whom household
income is not reported. After removing these observations, we also exclude children who fall into the
following categories: (1) We deliberately exclude children when there is doubt about whether reported
household income adequately reflects the income over which the child may have a claim. Thus we remove
from our analysis children who, at the time of the interview, were not living with at least one of their
parents (5483 cases). (2) We remove children who were not the sons or daughters of the reference person
or spouse (18608 children). Our concern with including children residing with a grandparent head of
household (the largest alternative to residing with a parental head— 13741 cases) is that we do not know
how long the child has lived with the grandparent, and we may be falsely assigning to the child income that
does not reflect the income in which the child has a share, or has had a share for an unknown period of
time. (3) We remove children in households containing more than one family (899 children), and children
who are not members of the “primary family” within the household (2382 children). (4) We remove 5095
children from households where children in the households are reported to be of different races. (Difference
in race within a sibship may reflect children having fathers of different races, and we would not choose to
remove such children just for this reason. However, difference in reported race may also be due to
measurement error, or to children being fostered.) (5) We are also interested in whether our results are
robust to the inclusion (exclusion) of controls for parental and household characteristics that might have
independent effects of children’s health (family size; race; mothers’ age, education and an unemployment
indicator if she is present; fathers’ age, education and an unemployment indicator if he is present), and we
restrict our core sample to children for whom this information is available. Our core sample of children
from the NHIS is 229,330 observations. When we turn to the analysis of (sometimes rare) medical
conditions, we use the full sample of all children with non-missing information on income, family size, race,
age and gender.
Assignment of household income
The NHIS contains information on total household income for 27 income categories, in $1000 intervals
between an income of $0 and $20,000, and in $5000 intervals between $20,000 and $50,000. All
household incomes above $50000 are top coded. We assign incomes to these income categories using data
from the 1986-1995 March Current Population Surveys. Specifically, we calculate, for each income
category in each year, the mean total household income in the CPS for households whose head’s education
matches that of the reference person in the household and whose income falls into that income category. For
households containing both a reference person and spouse, we used the education of the male (whether he
was the reference person or not) to match income information across the data sets.
Definitions of medical conditions:
The conditions we use are drawn from 5 of the 6 “condition lists” in the National Health Interview Survey.

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
We restrict our sample to children whose survey information was given by a parent, and whose household
reference person was either that parent or a spouse. Family income is measured within twenty $1000
brackets between $0 and $19,999 per year, $5000 brackets between $20,000 and $49,999, and one bracket
for $50,000 and above. The survey was conducted over the course of six years, but families are only
identified as being surveyed in the first or second three-year period. The average annual inflation rate of 3.8
percent that prevailed during this period is likely to introduce a moderate degree of measurement error in
measures of real income. We assign families to the midpoint of their income interval and adjust for the
difference in the average price level between the first and second half of the survey.

Notes on the NHIS results: The numbers in parentheses are robust standard errors, where correlation is allowed
between unobservables for observations from the same household. For rows labeled “controls 1,” each regression
included complete sets of age and year dummies; the logarithm of family size; indicators variables for whether the child
has a mother in the household, has a father in the household, is male, is black, is white; interactions of the indicator for
whether a mother (father) is in the household with mother’s (father’s) age; indicators for whether both the mother and
father were respondents to the health survey, whether the father and not the mother was a respondent to the health
survey, and whether neither the mother nor father were respondents to the health survey (the excluded category is that
the mother but not the father was the respondent.) For rows labeled “controls 2,” all variables in “controls 1” are
included plus the measures of the mother’s (father’s) schooling shown in the table and indicators of whether the mother
(father) is unemployed, where each education and unemployment variable is interacted with an indicator of whether the
mother (father) is in the household. The sample is restricted to children age 17 or younger, who come from singlefamily households, who are members of the “primary family” in the household, who are children of either the reference
person or spouse of reference person, who are of the same race as other children in the household, and who have non-

37

missing values for all of the variables included in the regression. All children in a household are removed if any
children in the household are removed. Total sample size is 229,330.
Notes on the NHANES III results: The numbers in parentheses are standard errors. “Controls 3” includes an indicator
for whether the family was in the highest income bracket, whether the child is white or black, male, whether the mother
reported for the child, whether the person was sampled in 1988-1991, a complete set of dummies for the child’s age,
the logarithm of family size, whether the household reference person is a woman, and the reference person’s age and
marital status. Cases are dropped if the survey respondent was not a parent of the child, or if the respondent was not the
household reference person or married to the reference person.

*

Evaluated at median ln(y).
Note: Robust standard errors in parentheses. Each row contains the results of three identical regressions estimated for
different ages groups (0-17, 0-8, and 9-17). For each regression, an indicator of poor health is regressed on the
logarithm of family income, denoted as ln(y), an indicator of whether the child has the health condition listed for that
row, and an interaction of ln(y) and the condition indicator. The effect of the condition on poor health is evaluated at
median ln(y). In addition, each regression includes a complete set of age dummies, year dummies, the logarithm of
family size, and indicator variables for whether the child was male, white or black. The coefficient on ln(y) is not
shown in the table, but is negative and significantly different from zero in all regressions.

include a complete set of age dummies, the logarithm of family size, indicators variables for whether the child has a
mother in the household, a father in the household, whether the child is male, black, or white, interactions of the
indicator for whether a mother is in the household with mother’s age and mother’s education, and interactions of the
indicator for whether a father is in the household with father’s age and father’s education. Other controls include
dummy variables for whether both the mother and father were respondents to the health survey, whether the father and
not the mother was a respondent to the health survey, and whether neither the mother nor father were respondents to
the health survey (the excluded category is that the mother but not the father was the respondent.)

Notes: Robust standard errors in parentheses. For the NHIS, the sample and set of controls is identical to that used in
the lower panel of Table 2, the only different being the addition of the parental health measures. For the PSID, the
sample and set of controls is identical to that in Table 5 except for the addition of the parental health measures and the
loss of a small number of observations due to missing information on parental health. In all cases, parental health is
interacted with an indicator for whether the parent is present in the household. An indicator of whether the parent is
present is also included.

for whether the mother or father or another adult was the child’s health respondent, an indicator that a mother figure
is present, and her age and education if present, an indicator that a father figure is present, and his age and education
if present. Panel B also includes a complete set of indicators for family type: birth mother and father, birth mother and
other father, birth mother only, other mother only, other mother and birth father, birth father only, other father only,
or two non-birth parent, and each of these controls interacted with the log of family income. The Chi-square test is for
equality of the coefficients for log of family income when child is living with a birth mother and birth father and the
log of family income when the child is living with two non-birth parents.

insurance of had medicaid coverage. 85.8% of the children are insured; 12.4% are on medicaid. “Has condition”
equals 1 if the child has had at least of the following types of conditions: vision problem, hearing problem, speech
problem, deformity, digestive problem, epilepsy, frequent headaches, heart condition, respiratory problem, tonsilitis,
anemia (including sickle cell anemia), a set of infectious diseases (e.g. mononucleosis, hepatitis, pneumonia), a skin or
bone condition, frequent ear infections, diabetes or asthma. “Has other condition” is the same as “has condition” except
asthma is excluded from the list. All variables in “controls 1” (listed in Table 2) are included in each regression.

present in the birth year (columns 1, 4 and 7); in the 1st year after birth (columns 2, 5 and 8); and in the 2nd year after
birth (columns 3, 6 and 9); and indicators that the mother is white and that the mother is black. The variable
ICU/LBW is an indicator that the child had a low birth weight (less than 2500 grams, 5.5 lbs) or that the child was
moved to a neo-natal intensive care unit (ICU) after birth. Standard errors are presented in parentheses, and were
estimated allowing correlation between unobservables for children in the same household.
