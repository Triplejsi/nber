Introduction

Politicians are convinced that helping exporters is a no-lose issue. The
argument in its most elemental form goes as follows: exports are good and
exporters are good firms, thus helping domestic firms export is good policy.
The desire to promote exports is not limited to oﬃcials at the national
level. All 50 U.S. states have oﬃces to assist firms in selling goods and
services abroad and the resources devoted to export promotion by states
rose from $21 million to $96 million from 1984 to 1992 (NASDA, 1993).
There has been a concurrent boom in export activity. Merchandise exports
grew three times faster than overall manufacturing during the same period.
In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on the export decision by U.S.
manufacturing firms. In a dynamic framework, we consider the impact of
individual plant attributes, barriers to entry, exchange rates, spillovers, and
export promotion during a period of extraordinary export growth. In doing
so we propose a simple estimation strategy to identify the role of sunk costs
and unobserved plant heterogeneity.
We model the decision of the firm to export and test several hypotheses about the factors that increase the propensity for exporting. Starting
with the characteristics of the firm itself, we ask whether size, labor force
composition, product mix, and past performance are important for entry in
foreign markets. Next, we directly address several ongoing debates in the
trade literature about factors that might matter in the export decision. A
set of theoretical models by Dixit (1989a,b), Krugman (1989) and others
suggest that hysteresis in exports may be due to the sunk costs in entering
the export market at the firm level. We test for the possible presence of entry costs by looking at the eﬀects of exporting yesterday on exporting today.
In addition we construct industry exchange rates and estimate the participation response to favorable price movements. The literature on economic
geography and trade (Krugman 1992) hypothesizes that activities of neighboring firms may reduce entry costs. We estimate the impact of spillovers
from the activities of other firms in the same industry or region. Finally,
we consider direct evidence on the eﬃcacy of government intervention with
data on state expenditures for export promotion.
Two recent papers on firms in developing countries, Roberts and Tybout
(1997) and Aitken, Hanson, and Harrison (1997) examine factors influencing
the export decision. Roberts and Tybout (1997) develop a dynamic model
of the export decision by a profit-maximizing firm and test for the presence
and magnitude of sunk costs using a sample of Colombian plants. They
find that sunk costs are large and are a significant source of export persis2

tence. They also find that unobserved heterogeneity across plants plays a
significant role in the probability that a firm exports. In a static framework,
Aitken, Hanson, and Harrison (1997) examine the role of geographic and
sectoral spillovers on exporting by plants in Mexico. They find that the
presence of multinational exporters in the same industry and state increases
the probability of exporting by Mexican firms.
The recent work on the export behavior of firms has emphasized the
heterogeneity of firm characteristics.1 Comparing plants at a point in time,
Bernard and Jensen (1995, 1997) document large, significant diﬀerences between exporters and non-exporters among U.S. manufacturing plants. Exporters have more workers, proportionally more white collar workers, higher
wages, higher productivity, greater capital intensity, higher technology intensity, and are more likely to be part of a multi-plant firm. However, these
substantial cross-section diﬀerences between exporters and non-exporters
cannot tell us about the direction of causality, i.e., do good firms become
exporters or do exporters become good firms. Roberts and Tybout (1997) include some plant characteristics in their work and find that plant size, plant
age, and the structure of ownership are positively related to the propensity
to export. Aitken, Hanson, and Harrison (1997) report evidence that plant
size, wages, and especially foreign ownership are positively related to the
decision to export.
We employ a rich set of plant variables including indicators of past success, labor quality, ownership structure, and product introductions to shed
light on the role of plant characteristics in the export decision. We find that
these plant attributes can explain a large fraction of the probability that a
plant exports and, perhaps not surprisingly, past success is the best plant
level indicator of future exporting.
Our estimates of entry costs are significant for U.S. plants. Exporting
today increases the probability of exporting tomorrow by 36%.We also find
that plant heterogeneity is substantial and important in the export decision;
only a subset of plants have the necessary characteristics to be exporters.
Favorable exchange rate shocks do increase participation in exporting but
we find no role for geographic or industry spillovers, and no eﬀect of state
export promotion on exporting.
We begin by developing a simple model of the decision to enter the export market by the firm considering the role of entry costs and other forms
1
Throughout this paper, we abuse terminology and freely interchange the terms ‘firms’
and ‘plants’, as has been the practice in the empirical literature on micro export behavior. As in other studies, due to limitations of the data, we use the plant as the unit of
observation for the empirical work.

of intertemporal spillovers. Next, in section 3, we discuss the characteristics of our sample of 13,550 plants from 1984 to 1992, including diﬀerences
between exporters and non-exporters and rates of transition in and out of
exporting. In section 4 we present the estimation strategy and issues regarding specifications and identification. Section 5 contains the main results. In
Section 6 we consider alternative estimation strategies. We conclude with
implications of the results for policy and future research.

2

Modelling the Export Decision

We model the decision to export by the rational, profit-maximizing firm
as analogous to the decision to market a new product. The firm considers
expected profits today and in the future from the decision to enter the foreign
market net of any fixed costs. We proceed in several steps, first outlining the
decision of the firm in the single period case and then incorporating multiple
periods and entry costs.
We assume that the firm is always able to produce at the profit-maximizing
∗ , if it enters the foreign market. In the one period case
level of exports, qit
with no entry costs, the firm receives profits
∗
)
πit (Xt , Zit ) = pt · qit∗ − cit (Xt , Zit |qit

(1)

where pt is the price of goods sold abroad and cit (·) is the variable cost
∗ . Exogenous factors aﬀecting profitability, such
of producing quantity qit
as exchange rates, are denoted as Xt , while firm-specific factors are denoted by Zit .2 Firm characteristics that might increase the probability of
exporting include size, labor composition, productivity, product mix, and
ownership structure. Besides shocks to demand, we focus on several additional exogenous factors which might aﬀect the probability that the firm
exports, including direct or indirect subsidies to exporting establishments
and spillovers from the presence of nearby exporters who reduce or raise the
costs of needed inputs such as high skilled labor or specialized capital.
If expected profits are greater than zero, then the firm will export. The
export status of firm i in period t is given by Yit , where
Yit = 1 if πit ≥ 0
.
Yit = 0 if πit < 0
2

(2)

Prices faced by the firm presumably depend on Xt and possibly on elements in Zit as
well, i.e. pt = pt (Xt , Zit ). To simplify notation, we write prices as pt throughout.

As long as the cost function does not depend on the level of output in a
previous period, this version of the multi-period problem is identical to the
single period model. However, if there is any eﬀect of production today on

Entry Costs

One focus of the existing literature on the decision to export has been on the
role of sunk costs.3 It is natural to think of costs associated with entering
foreign markets that may have the character of being sunk in nature. These
might include the cost of information about demand conditions abroad or
costs of establishing a distribution system. We refer to these as entry costs
and, for ease of exposition, we assume these costs recur in full if the firm
3

The theoretical literature on sunk costs and exporting is developed in papers by Dixit
(1989a,b), Baldwin (1988), Baldwin and Krugman (1989), and Krugman (1989). Roberts
and Tybout (1997) empirically address the question of entry and exit costs in the decision
to export by the profit maximizing firm. In considering sunk costs, our model follows
theirs.

Incorporating entry costs in a dynamic framework provides an extra
mechanism for today’s export decision by the firm to influence future decisions to export. This formulation of entry costs as sunk costs yields an
option value to waiting and thus increases the region where the firm chooses

where period-by-period profits are given by equation 6 and, as usual, are
constrained to be non-negative since the firm always has the option not
to export. This is equivalent to the firm choosing whether to export in
each period since we allow the firm to always pick the within period profit

The diﬀerence in the multi-period models with and without entry costs
comes through the added intertemporal link between exporting today and
exporting tomorrow embodied in the cost of entry. However, without a
structural model of the production function, and cost function, we will be

It is possible that there may be costs associated with exiting the export market, akin
to one time charges for closing a plant, however they will not change the structure of the
model or the estimation equation. In our empirical work, we test whether these entry
costs recur fully after one period or whether there is some persistent benefit from having
exported more than one year in the past.

unable to identify intertemporal spillovers due to learning and those due to
sunk costs.
While we choose to think about the export decision as the introduction
of a new good, one might imagine that firms choose total production quantities regardless of the intended destination. Only after production do firms
then decide which market, domestic or foreign, will yield the highest profits.
This plausible alternative approach to exporting yields almost identical implications for the value function given above and for our estimation strategy
with the notable exception that sunk costs should be negligible.
Our empirical work starts from the specification in equation 9. Rather
than parameterize the cost function, we choose to employ a non-structural
model in testing hypotheses about the role of firm characteristics, externalities, entry costs, and government expenditures in the decision to export by
the firm. Before outlining the estimation strategy, we discuss our panel of
plants and their characteristics.

3

Exporting and Plant Characteristics

To develop an understanding of why particular firms export, we assemble a
sample of continuously operating plants from 1984 to 1992. We use all such
plants in the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) from the Longitudinal
Research Database of the Bureau of the Census. The choice of a continuous
panel is motivated by two issues. To include observations on as many years
as possible, we were obliged to look at plants in the ASM. Certain plants,
primarily larger establishments, are sampled with certainty in each ASM,
other plants are included as non-certainty cases in a particular 5 year wave.
These non-certainty cases are automatically dropped in the subsequent 5
year wave. Given our need to estimate a dynamic specification with lagged
endogenous variables, we chose to assemble as long a panel as possible.5
As a result of these criteria, the resulting sample of 13,550 plants is
not representative of the far larger population of 197,000+ manufacturing
establishments in the Census of Manufactures (see Table 1).6 Plants in our
sample are substantially larger and far more likely to be exporters than
5
We also dropped any plant that failed during the sample period. Including such plants
would necessitate modelling the probability of death, seriously complicating the empirical
work. This assumption is not innocuous, however, as exporting plants fail less frequently
than non-exporters.
6
The total population of manufacturing establishments is 300,000+ of which 197,000+
are surveyed directly in the Census of Manufactures. See U.S. Bureau of the Census (1987)
for details.

7

manufacturers generally. As a result, the plants we observe are among the
most important in manufacturing, accounting for 41% of total employment,
52% of total output, and 70% of total exports in 1987. These features mean
that we are not necessarily estimating the ‘true’ probability of exporting. In
particular, we have little to say about the behavior of small plants. However,
we do capture the preponderance of the export activity in the U.S. economy,
suggesting that implications for policy from the sample should be robust.
Table 2 shows the export characteristics of the sample for 1984 and 1992.
The export boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s shows up clearly in the
sample. Exporters went from 48% of the plants in 1984 to more than 54% in
1992. At the same time, the real value of exports at the average plant rose
from $10.3 million to $17.0 million. This rapid rise meant that the share of
shipments exported was climbing from 8.5% to 11.4% even as the number
of exporters increased.
Table 3 reports means of plant characteristics for exporters and nonexporters in 1984 and 1992 for the sample. In addition, columns 3 and
6 present percentage diﬀerences between exporters and non-exporters after controlling for 4-digit (SIC - standard industrial classification) industry
and state. In both periods, there are substantial diﬀerences between the
two types of plants. Exporters are substantially larger, pay higher wages,
have higher productivity, and are more likely to belong to a multi-plant
firm. Controlling for industry and state in 1984, we find that exporters are
substantially larger (37%-44%), pay higher wages to all types of workers
(3.0%-10.9%), and are more productive (6.7%-10.5%).
The picture remains largely unchanged in 1992: exporters are still substantially larger, pay higher wages, and are more productive than nonexporters in the same state and industry. While the size diﬀerence between
exporters and non-exporters shrank slightly, the wage and productivity differentials are essentially unchanged or slightly greater in the latter period.
While exporting has become more commonplace in recent years, there still
remain substantial diﬀerences between exporters and non-exporters.

3.1

Transitions In and Out of Exporting

The preceding results show clearly that exporters diﬀer substantially from
non-exporters, even within the same industry. To understand the magnitude
of the flows in and out of exporting, we look at the transition rates in our
sample of plants.
In Figure 1, we show the numbers of exporters and non-exporters in our
sample as well as the fraction of each group that switched status from year
8

to year. The export boom of the early 1990s is evident. Exporters accounted
for just under half of the plants in 1984 but by 1992 there had been a net
gain of 344 plants, raising the share of exporters to 54%.
Exporting is not a once and forever phenomenon. Year-to-year transition
rates are large. On average over the period, 13.9% of non-exporters begin
to export in any given year while 12.6% of exporters stop. Even in the later
part of the sample, during the export boom, exits averaged over 10% per
year and entries more than 14% per year. The rise in exporting comes more
from a decline in exits than a rise in entrants. This substantial degree of
mixing in the export market bodes well for testing our hypotheses, as we
have numerous observations both for exits and entries.7
While substantial numbers of plants enter and exit the export market
each year and exporting became more prevalent during the period, there
is still a large degree of persistence in the export status of an individual
plant. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 4 report the fraction of exporters and
non-exporters in 1984 who were also exporters in one of the subsequent
eight years.8 Among plants that exported in 1984, 80.3% were exporting
four years later and 78.6% were exporting in 1992. Non-exporters show
similar persistence, 78.2% remained non-exporters in 1988 and 70.4% were
non-exporters in 1992.
Columns 3 and 4 of Table 4 report the predicted rates of persistence if
exits and entrants were chosen randomly using the calculated annual transition rates. At all horizons, the predicted persistence is substantially lower
than that observed in the sample. From this we conclude that there is a
substantial amount of reentry by former exporters, i.e., they have higher
probabilities of exporting after having exited the export market. Similarly,
former non-exporters have a higher propensity to stop exporting.
We would like to know whether this persistence in exporting results from
attributes of the plants themselves, i.e., certain plants are more exportoriented, or from sunk costs, i.e., exporting begets more exporting.9 To
provide some evidence on the relative importance of the two eﬀects we look
7
Roberts and Tybout (1997) report average entry and exit rates of 2.7% and 11.0%
per year respectively for Columbian plants and fully 86% of the plants in their sample
never change export status. In their sample of 2113 Mexican plants, Aitken, Hanson, and
Harrison (1997) find only 245 plants changed export status from 1986-1989. During that
same period 39.4% of the plants in our sample switched status.
8
These percentages treat plants that exit and reenter the same as plants that export
continuously. For example, the exporter percentage for 1986 includes plants that exported
in 1984, 1985, and 1986 as well as those that exported just in 1984 and 1986.
9
This is the fundamental problem we will face in the estimation of the decision to
export, i.e. the identification of unobserved plant heterogeneity and sunk costs.

9

at the distribution of exporting sequences in the data. We make the assumption that plant heterogeneity aﬀects the fraction of time that a plant is an
exporter, but not the probability of exporting in consecutive periods. We
then calculate the probability a plant follows a given sequence of exporting
and non-exporting conditional on the fraction of the time the plant is an
exporter. If plant eﬀects are important, we expect to see concentrations
of plants both exporting in most years and not exporting in most years.
If sunk costs are important, we expect to observe runs of exporting and
non-exporting rather than random switching.
Table 5 reports the distribution of plants across all the 128 possible
sequences of exporting and non-exporting for the seven years from 19861992. Clearly, a large fraction of plants exports in all seven years, 28.2%,
and an equally large fraction, 29.0%, never exports.10 In addition, plants
are more likely to export once (7.5%) or for six years (11.4%) than for
three (5.0%) or four (5.9%). We also observe that runs of exporting and
non-exporting are common events. Figure 2 reports the probability that a
plant follows a given sequence conditional on the fact that it exported in
3 of 7 years. Sequences with runs, such as 1110000 and 0000111, are more
prevalent than those without runs, 0010101 and 0101010.
To get some perspective on the heterogeneity of entry and exit across
industries, we report the average annual entry and exit rates by two digit
industry in Figure 3. Printing (SIC 27) and petroleum (SIC 29) and apparel
(SIC 23) show lower entry and exit rates than the average, however most
industries are similar to the overall pattern of switching.
Taken together the preceding results suggest that both unobserved plant
heterogeneity and sunk costs are likely to be important in the decision to
export. We turn now to the estimation of the model in section 2 considering
the role of plant characteristics, sunk costs, spillovers and government export
promotion.

Empirical Methodology

From the multi-period model with entry costs given in section 2, we find
that a firm exports if current and expected revenues are greater than costs,

(10)
Yit =

10
Alternatively, depending on one’s priors, one could conclude that a surprisingly large
fraction of the plants switches in and out of exporting.

+ δ (Et [Vit+1 (·) | qit∗ > 0] − Et [Vit+1 (·) | qit∗ = 0]) .

(11)

Our goal is to identify and quantify factors that increase the probability
of exporting. We estimate these eﬀects using a binary choice non-structural
approach of the form

1 if βXit + γZit − N · (1 − Yit−1 ) + εit > 0

Plant characteristics are included in the vector Zit , while other factors such
as terms of trade shocks, industry demand shocks, state-industry spillovers,
and government subsidies are included in Xit . Xit includes a plant subscript
since we calculate some exogenous variables for individual plants.

4.1

Experience and Entry Costs

As noted previously, the most diﬃcult, and most important, issue in the
estimation of equation 12 concerns the identification of the parameter on
the lagged endogenous variable. It is highly likely that there are unobserved
characteristics such as product attributes or managerial ability which aﬀect
the decision to export by the firm. Since these characteristics are potentially
permanent, or at least highly serially correlated, and unobserved by the
econometrician, they will induce persistence in export behavior, either in or
out of the market, and thus will cause us to overestimate the entry costs and
experience eﬀects discussed above.11 In practice this means that the error
term, εit , can be thought of as comprising two components, a permanent
plant-specific element, κi , and a transitory component, η it .
There are several potential estimation strategies for this dynamic binary
choice framework with unobserved heterogeneity, including probit with random or fixed eﬀects, conditional logit, and linear probability models with
fixed or random eﬀects. A starting point in choosing among the available
specifications is the decision whether unobserved plant heterogeneity is better modelled as fixed or random eﬀects. The use of random eﬀects requires
that the plant eﬀects be uncorrelated with the regressors. Most fixed effects models, on the other hand, produce biased and inconsistent parameter
estimates, especially for the coeﬃcient on the lagged dependent variable.
11

See Heckman (1981) for an analysis of the theoretical issues and Roberts and Tybout
(1997) for a discussion in the exporting context.

11

The required assumption for random eﬀects is quite likely violated in our
export decision model as plant characteristics such as size, wage levels, and
ownership characteristics are apt to be correlated with product attributes,
managerial ability, technology and other unobserved plant eﬀects. As a
result, unlike previous studies, we choose to work with a linear probability
framework,
(13)
Yit = βXit−1 + γZit−1 + θYit−1 + εit ,
for its computational simplicity and because it allows us to model the unobserved plant eﬀects as fixed. In section 6, we compare the results from
the linear probability model with those from a probit model with random
eﬀects.
We proceed in several steps. First, we estimate equation 13 in levels, ignoring any plant eﬀects. The levels specification gives us an upper bound on
the importance of sunk costs.12 Bernard and Jensen (1995) show that plants
switching export status from non-exporter to exporter, and vice versa, undergo dramatic contemporaneous changes in size, employment composition,
and wages. However, the direction of the causality remains uncertain in that
analysis so we lag all plant characteristics and other exogenous variables one
year to avoid possible simultaneity problems.
Next, we explicitly consider the role of permanent plant eﬀects, κi , as in
Yit = βXit−1 + γZit−1 + θYit−1 + κi + ηit .

(14)

We estimate equation 14 first in levels, i.e., fixed eﬀects, and then in differences. The fixed eﬀects estimates are almost surely biased downwards
and inconsistent but give us a lower bound for the importance of the lagged
endogenous variable. For the specification in first diﬀerences, we employ an
instrumental variables estimator and use two lags of the levels of the right
hand side variables as instruments, i.e. (Xit−2 , Xit−3 , Zit−2 , Zit−3 , Yit−2 ,
Yit−3 ),
(15)
∆Yit = β∆Xit−1 + γ∆Zit−1 + θ∆Yit−1 + ∆ηit .
This specification avoids the serious problem of inconsistent estimates found
in the fixed eﬀects model.13
The structure of the error term, η it , is important in the interpretation
of the results. For example, if shocks are transitory, cov(ηit , η it−1 ) = 0,
12

The levels specification also allows us to observe the eﬀects of time-invariant plant
attributes on export probabilities. Any variables that do not change over time, such as
multinational status, will be perfectly correlated with the fixed eﬀect.
13
See Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and Rosen (1988) and Keane and Runkle (1992).

12

then relatively large entry costs will lead to persistence in exporting (or
non-exporting) while small entry costs will allow firms to enter and exit the
market more often.14 Persistent shocks, η it = δη it−1 + ν it , with δ near one,
can overcome the eﬀects of large entry costs. Firms observing a positive
shock today believe that their good fortune will persist and that the value
of entry is large. Unmodelled persistence in the error structure would be
picked up by the lagged endogenous variable and thus incorrectly interpreted
as high entry costs. Our specification in first diﬀerences should help alleviate
this problem as well, although we will suﬀer a loss in eﬃciency if the shocks
are purely transitory.

4.2

Plant Characteristics

Drawing on the cross-sectional comparisons of exporters and non-exporters
above and elsewhere, we consider several hypotheses about the role of plant
characteristics in the export decision. Perhaps the most obvious plant attributes to consider are those related to past success. It would appear to be
relatively uncontroversial to claim that good firms become exporters, however, a substantial fraction of export policy assumes instead that exporters
become good firms. The measures of plant success we consider include size
and productivity. Consistently in all samples and time periods, exporters
are much larger plants. Size may proxy for several eﬀects; larger firms by
definition have been successful in the past, but size may be associated with
lower average, or marginal, costs, providing a separate mechanism for size
to increase the likelihood of exporting. We use productivity, measured by
total factor productivity, as an additional measure of plant success.
We also consider the role of labor quality. If exported goods are of
higher quality and thus have a higher value to weight ratio, then we would
expect the quality of the workforce to be positively related with entrance
into foreign markets. To proxy for workforce quality, we use lagged average
wages and the ratio of white collar to total employees.
A sizable body of research has focused on the role of multinationals,
and ownership more generally, in cross-border trade.15 We include dummy
variables for multinational status and multi-plant firms to capture these
ownership eﬀects.16 Finally, we consider aspects of the products themselves.
14

All discussions of large entry costs are relative to the magnitude of shocks hitting the
firm.
15
See Brainard (1997).
16
Since these characteristics do not change over time, they will be included only in the
levels estimates.

13

To see whether firms export after introducing new products, we include a
dummy for plants that have changed products. The product change dummy
equals one if the 4-digit industry code of the plant switches.

4.3

Exchange Rates

In addition to considering the role of plant characteristics, we test a number of hypotheses from the literature on exporting. Of particular interest is
the participation response to favorable exchange rate shocks. Since aggregate exchange rate movements will be washed out by the inclusion of time
dummies, we construct industry specific exchange rates. The exchange rate
for each four digit industry is a weighted average of the real exchange rate
indices for the top 25 US export destinations. The weights are the average
shares of exports from that industry for that destination over the period.
The use of these industry exchange rates gives us a unique opportunity
to estimate the supply response of exporters to price shocks. Of course,
we will be estimating the diﬀerential response across industries and may be
underestimating the response to aggregate exchange rate movements.

4.4

Spillovers

One emerging body of work focuses on the spillovers between the activities
and locations of other firms and export behavior. Aitken, Hanson, and
Harrison (1997) use a static model of the export decision to estimate the
impact of other exporters, and in particular multinationals, in the same
region and industry. They argue that externalities of this form reduce the
cost of access to foreign markets. If there are significant entry costs and
the proximity of exporters reduces these costs, then there will be a dynamic
eﬀect increasing the probability of exporting today and thus tomorrow. We
test for spillovers using such a dynamic specification.
A separate form of externality might arise if the presence of other exporters lowers the cost of production, possibly by increasing the availability
of specialized capital and labor inputs. This spillover enters directly through
the cost function. We include spillover variables in our set of exogenous
variables, recognizing that in a general equilibrium model such activities
would be endogenously determined. We consider three separate forms of
spillovers, region-specific, industry-specific and local to the industry and region. Region-specific spillovers are captured by export activity in the same
state but outside the 2-digit (SIC) industry. Industry-specific spillovers occur within the same industry but outside the state of the plant, while local

14

spillover are captured by export activity in the same industry and state as
the plant.17 To gauge the magnitude of exporting activity within each category, we use two separate measures, the number of plants that export and
the quantity of exports from plants in the category.

4.5

Subsidies

The rapid growth in state government expenditures for export promotion
suggests that policy-makers believe that there are substantial social benefits
to assisting exporting. State export promotion has several potential benefits. By gathering information on foreign markets, states may reduce the
cost of entry and thus promote export participation. This would be evident through a reduction in entry costs. Alternatively, states may provide a
coordination role for potential, or current, exporters and thus decrease the
costs of exporting. This might be seen through increased numbers of exporters within the state or through increased volumes by existing exporters.
Of course, a positive eﬀect of state expenditures on export participation is
necessary but not suﬃcient to show that such outlays are beneficial.
We include state expenditures on export promotion in our set of regressors. Unfortunately, these figures are only available for alternating years in
the sample so we interpolate to fill in the missing years. In addition, we
recognize that public expenditures are not necessarily exogenous; increasing numbers of exporters in a state may induce state oﬃcials to commit
resources to exporting.

Empirical Results

Our data set consists of 13550 plants yielding 94902 observations for the
levels regressions and 71166 for the instrumental variables specification in
first diﬀerences. The lagged export status variable is 0 if the plant did
not export last year, 1 if it did. Table 6 reports results from the linear
probability specifications, levels, fixed eﬀects, and diﬀerences, for the basic
model. Table 7 contains the results for the basic model with spillovers and
state export promotion expenditures.

5.1

Estimates without plant eﬀects

15

probability model in levels. Dummies for 4-digit industry, state, and year are
included as well as the measure of industry exchange rates. Plant level variables enter significantly in the export decision and confirm the hypotheses
about the role of plant characteristics. Large, productive plants have higher
probabilities of exporting. The indicators of labor quality, high average
wages and white collar employment share, also are significantly positively
correlated with exporting. Ownership of the plant by a U.S. multinational
increases the probability of exporting but being part of a multi-plant firm
does not significantly increase the probability. We include a measures of
product change, a dummy if the plant switched industry last year. A recent industry switch enters with a positive and significant coeﬃcient. This
provides the first evidence that new product introductions increase the probability of exporting. Our industry exchange rate measure enters with the
expected negative sign, an appreciation of the domestic currency reduces the
probability of exporting, although it is only significant at the 10% level.
As discussed above, if there are significant unobserved plant eﬀects, the
levels specification will yield inconsistent estimates and, in particular, will
produce an upward biased coeﬃcient on the lagged endogenous variable,
and thus overestimate the role of sunk costs in exporting. We find that the
coeﬃcient on lagged export status is positive, significant, and improbably
large, suggesting that exporting last year raises the probability of exporting
today by 66%. Having last exported two years ago also enters with a very
large, positive and significant coeﬃcient suggesting that the sunk costs act
like a slowly depreciating investment.
We now turn to the fixed eﬀect estimates and our preferred instrumental
variables specification in first diﬀerences.

5.2

Estimates with plant eﬀects

Column 2 of Table 6 reports results from the fixed eﬀects model in equation
14. As expected, the coeﬃcients on lagged export status (our proxy for sunk
costs) is greatly reduced to 0.203.18 Similarly the coeﬃcient on having last
exported two years ago is much smaller, 0.027, although still significant at
the 1% level. Controlling for plant fixed eﬀects soaks up much of the eﬀects of
our plant characteristics, plant productivity and white collar worker shares
are no longer significant. However, plant size and average plant wages are
still strongly positively associated with the probability of exporting, even
after controlling for plant fixed eﬀects. In addition, the measure of product
18

This reduction results from the biased estimates of the fixed eﬀects model in relatively
short panels.

16

change is still positive and significant and the exchange rate measure again
is negative and significant.
Column 3 of Table 6 reports results from the IV diﬀerences specification in equation 15. Among the plant characteristics, plant size and average
wages remain positive and significant, and the magnitudes of both coefficients rise dramatically. Other plant attributes, such as the fraction of
white collar workers and productivity, are primarily level eﬀects, as they
are no longer significant in the diﬀerences specification and thus are indistinguishable from the plant fixed eﬀect. Product changes continue to be
significant determinants of exporting. Changing product categories last
year increases the probability of exporting by 3.3%.
Lagged export status again enters with a positive and significant coefficient, again rejecting the hypothesis of no sunk costs.19 Having exported
last period increases the probability of exporting today by 36% while having
last exported two years ago increases the probability by 10.5%. Controlling
for plant eﬀects yields a significant estimate of the combined role of entry
costs and experience. This confirms the earlier descriptive results where
transition rates were high but, at the same time, a large fraction of plants
did not change their export status. There are strong plant-specific components to the decision to export, but transitions in and out are relatively easy
for those plants with the correct set of attributes.
To provide a check on the robustness of the estimates of the sunk cost
parameter we estimate the IV diﬀerences specification separately for each
two digit manufacturing industry. In Figure 3 we saw that the amount of
switching in and out of exporting was relatively stable across industries. In
Figure 4 we show the point estimates on lagged export status for the IV
diﬀerence specification by two digit industry. The estimates are quite stable
across industries generally ranging from 0.25 to 0.40 with only miscellaneous
manufacturing showing a dramatically higher estimate, 0.52, of the sunk
costs of export entry.

5.3

Spillovers and Subsidies

We consider the role of spillovers from neighboring export activity in Table
7.20 In defining proximity to a plant for spillovers, we consider both the role
of geography and industry. As discussed above, we run two specifications,
19
We caution that separate identification of entry costs and experience eﬀects is not
possible.
20
To conserve space, we only report coeﬃcients and indicate significance at the 10%,
5% and 1% levels in Table 7.

17

one with (log) counts of plants and the other employing the (log) quantity of
exports. None of the spillover measures is positive and significantly diﬀerent
from zero. In several cases the spillover measure enters with a negative and
significant coeﬃcient.21
Table 7 also reports results with the measure of state export promotion. Contemporaneous state export promotion is slightly positive but not
significant. As with spillovers, the selection of large plants may be exactly
the wrong sample to observe the eﬀects of state export promotion as most
agencies explicitly target small and medium size firms.
The results presented in this section emphatically confirm the presence
of entry costs in exporting. The magnitude of the sunk costs is significant
and depreciates over time. Having exported last year increases the export
probability by 36% while the benefit is reduced to 10.5% after two years.
Plant characteristics, both observed (size, wage levels) and unobserved, play
a major role in determining the export status of a plant. Exchange rate
movements have the expected eﬀect on export participation while spillovers
and state government expenditures have no eﬀect on exporting probabilities.

6

Alternative Estimation Strategies

We recognize that the linear probability specification pursued above is not
the normal first choice for binary choice problems. The potential problems
of such a estimation method are well known, i.e. that the predicted probabilities may lie outside of the 0-1 range. In this section, we discuss issues
surrounding another estimation strategy, probit with and without random
eﬀects, focussing on the coeﬃcients on the lagged dependent variable.22
The diﬃculties in consistently estimating a dynamic specification in
panel data with persistent plant-specific errors are well known. Fixed effects estimators in models with lagged endogenous variables produce biased
and inconsistent estimates. Heckman (1981) discusses the issue of statedependence and plant eﬀects in a binary choice model. Heckman proposes a
random eﬀects probit estimator although he notes that if the heterogeneity
of the unobserved plant eﬀects is large, the random eﬀects probit estimate
of the coeﬃcient on the lagged dependent variable may be biased upwards.
Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and Rosen (1988) discuss the problem in a vector au21

In results not reported here, other measures of spillovers, such as those employed by
Aitken, Hanson, and Harrison (1997), are also insignificant and usually negative.

Coeﬃcients on other variables are qualitatively similar across specifications. A full
set of results for all variables is available on request.

18

toregressive framework with continuous dependent variables. They propose
the diﬀerenced instrumental variable method that we employ in section 5.23
As discussed previously, there are compelling reasons to employ a fixed,
rather than a random, eﬀects specification as the fixed eﬀects approach
avoids the diﬃculty of correlated plant eﬀects and regressors. If the time
dimension of the panel is large enough, the bias induced by the fixed eﬀects
estimator will be small. Roberts and Tybout (1997), in their study of
sunk costs in the export decision by Colombian plants, employ a version of
the random eﬀects probit estimator suggested by Heckman (1981). As in
our specification, they assume the errors, εit , are comprised of a permanent
plant-specific element and a purely transitory component, εit = κi + ηit .
The permanent component, κi, is assumed to be uncorrelated across plants,
cov(κi, κj ) = 0, and the transitory component, ηit , uncorrelated across time,
cov(η it, ηit−s ) = 0.
These assumptions allow them to estimate equation 12 as a dynamic random eﬀects probit, after assuming that the errors are normally distributed.
The random eﬀects probit suggested by Heckman (1981) uses a single parameter, σ2κi , to parameterize the distribution of the plant eﬀect. However,
this is may provide a poor fit to the underlying unobserved plant eﬀects for
the export decision problem if the distribution of plants is highly bimodal.
Remember, that almost 30% of the plants in the sample never export and
almost 30% continuously export. Any failure to adequately capture the
distribution of plant eﬀects will increase the coeﬃcient on the lagged endogenous variable.24
To evaluate the various estimation strategies, we present some additional
results for the base model concentrating on estimates of the coeﬃcient on the
lagged endogenous variable. Recall that ignoring plant eﬀects, the estimated
coeﬃcient from the linear probability model was 0.66. Row 4 of Table 8
shows that a probit without plant eﬀects yields an almost identical eﬀect of
23

Card and Sullivan (1988) first consider a conditional logit estimator to deal with
individual eﬀects but show that a suﬃcient statistic for the individual eﬀect requires the
full path of outcomes, both forward and backward in time. They then use a random eﬀects
estimator where the random eﬀects are parameterized by a discrete distribution with four
nodes. Such a specification may improve upon the random eﬀects probit specification
discussed below if the distribution of plant eﬀects is indeed bimodal as discussed above.
24
One final, and important, problem remains in that the initial period export status,
Yi0 , is not exogenous if there are permanent plant-specific components in the error term.
Instruments for these initial values
Ybi0 = f (Xi,−1 , Zi,−1 ) + ξ i0

allow the errors to be correlated with the permanent plant-specific error, cov(κi , ξ i0 ) = ρ1 .

19

0.66.25 In row 5, we present the estimate from the random eﬀects probit
model for the entire panel. The eﬀect of lagged export status is virtually
unchanged at 0.62.
This result is quite surprising as it suggests that unobserved plant heterogeneity has a minor role in the persistence of exporting and that there
are very large sunk costs. As suggested above, the source of this unchanged
estimate is probably the poor fit of the underlying plant eﬀect distribution.
As a check, we estimate the random eﬀects probit dropping plants that are
continuous exporters or continuous non-exporters.26 The coeﬃcient on the
lagged dependent variable drops substantially from 0.62 to 0.40, close to the
estimate from the linear probability specification.

7

Conclusions

In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on the export decision by U.S.
firms. In a dynamic framework, we consider the impact of barriers to entry,
individual plant attributes, exchange rates, spillovers, and export promotion.
In doing so we propose a simple estimation strategy to identify the role of
sunk costs and unobserved plant heterogeneity.
The major results are that entry costs are significant for U.S. plants and
plant heterogeneity is substantial and important in the export decision. The
role of plant heterogeneity is less surprising but means that only a subset of
plant may have the characteristics necessary to take advantage of favorable
shocks. The key unanswered question is how firms obtain the characteristics
that allow them to easily enter the export market.
We also test hypotheses about spillovers and subsidies from the recent
literature on trade and firms. We find no role for geographic spillovers and,
similarly, no evidence for the importance of export activity by other firms in
the same industry. In addition, state government export promotion has no
noticeable eﬀects on exporting in our sample. We caution that our results on
spillovers and subsidies may result from our sample selection criteria which
limit our analysis to large plants.

25
The coeﬃcients from the probit cannot be directly interpreted in terms of probabilities.
We evaluate the increase in the probability of exporting from having exported last period
at the mean of the regressors.
26
This is analogous to, but not the same as, a conditional probit. See Heckman (1981).

The numbers in columns 1 and 2 represent the percentage of exporters (non-exporters) in 1984 who were
also exporters in the listed year, i.e. 78.6% of the plants that exported in 1984 also exported in 1992. The
numbers in columns 3 and 4 represent the expected percentages if entering and exiting plants were chosen
randomly from the population with annual transition rates given by the data.
