‚ÄúThe direct benefits [of EMU] ‚Ä¶ in the form of reduced transactions costs and
reduced uncertainty, possibly including additional transparency in competition ‚Ä¶
are likely to be small ‚Ä¶‚Äù Wyplosz (1997)

‚ÄúIt is clear ‚Ä¶ that the European Commission‚Äôs (1991) claim ‚Ä¶ that the
integration of product and factor markets in Europe requires a single currency has
no basis in either theory or experience.‚Äù Feldstein (1997)

‚ÄúContrary to widespread belief, EMY is not about lower transactions costs in
cross-border operations, or about lower hedging costs, and all the other relatively
petty reasons that have been invoked in its defense.‚Äù M√ºnchau Financial Times
May 28, 1997.

1: Introduction
In this short paper we ask the question ‚ÄúWhat is the effect of currency union1
membership on international trade?‚Äù Since an increase in trade prompted by currency union
would be an unexpected benefit of European Monetary Union (EM) or dollarization, this is an
interesting question to both policy-makers and academics.
Rose (2000) estimated this effect using an essentially cross-sectional approach. He used
data for a large number of countries between 1970 and 1990 and found that bilateral trade was
higher for a pair of countries that used the same currency than for a pair of countries with their
own sovereign monies. More precisely, the coefficient (denoted Œ≥) on a currency union (CU)
dummy in an empirical model of bilateral trade was found to be positive and significant in both
economic and statistical terms. Its value rarely fell below 1.2, implying an effect of currency
union on trade of around (e1.2 ‚âà) 300%. This was true even after controlling for a number of
other factors, which might affect trade through the ‚Äúgravity‚Äù model. The latter states that trade
between a pair of countries is proportional to their combined incomes, and inversely proportional
to the distance between them.
There are a number of potential issues with the cross-sectional approach. Most
importantly, the policy question of interest is the (time series) question ‚ÄúWhat is the trade effect
of a country joining (or leaving) a currency union?‚Äù not the cross-sectional question ‚ÄúHow much
more do countries within currency unions trade than non-members?‚Äù Other possible problems

2

are econometric; for instance, pair-specific ‚Äúfixed effects‚Äù may obscure the econometric
estimates.
In this paper, we estimate the effect of currency unions on trade exploiting time series (as
well as cross-sectional) variation.2 We use a data set that covers a large number of countries for
fifty post-war years. During this sample, a large number of currency unions dissolved, allowing
us to use both time series and cross-sectional variation on currency union incidence. In
particular, we use the fact that over one hundred country-pairs dissolved common currency
linkages during the sample. By comparing their trade before and after this regime change
(holding other effects constant), we can estimate the effect of currency union membership on
trade.
Reassuringly, we find that our results are basically consistent with those of Rose (2000).
We find an economically and statistically significant effect of currency unions on trade using a
number of different panel estimation techniques. Our estimate is that bilateral trade rises/falls by
about 100% as a pair of countries forms/dissolves a currency union, ceteris paribus.
In section 2, we describe the data set and methodology that we use. Section 3 is the heart
of the paper, and presents estimation results of the effect of currency union on trade. After some
sensitivity analysis, the paper concludes with a brief summary.

2: Methodology and Data
Gravity Methodology
We are interested in estimating the effect of currency unions on international trade.
Towards that end, we estimate a conventional gravity model of international trade.3 We augment
the model with a number of extra controls:

ln(Xijt ) = Œ≤ 0 + Œ≤ 1 ln(YiYj)t + Œ≤ 2 ln(YiYj/PopiPopj)t + Œ≤ 3 lnDij + Œ≤ 4 Langij + Œ≤ 5 Contij + Œ≤ 6 FTAijt
+ Œ≤ 7 Landlij + Œ≤ 8 Islandij +Œ≤ 9 ln(AreaiAreaj) + Œ≤ 10 ComColij + Œ≤ 11 CurColijt
+ Œ≤ 12 Colonyij + Œ≤ 13 ComNatij + Œ≥CUijt + Œµ ijt

3

where i and j denotes countries, t denotes time, and the variables are defined as:
‚Ä¢

Xijt denotes the average value of real bilateral trade between i and j at time t,

‚Ä¢

Y is real GDP,

‚Ä¢

Pop is population,

‚Ä¢

D is the distance between i and j,

‚Ä¢

Lang is a binary variable which is unity if i and j have a common language,

‚Ä¢

Cont is a binary variable which is unity if i and j share a land border,

‚Ä¢

FTA is a binary variable which is unity if i and j belong to the same regional trade
agreement,

‚Ä¢

Landl is the number of landlocked countries in the country-pair (0, 1, or 2).

‚Ä¢

Island is the number of island nations in the pair (0, 1, or 2),

‚Ä¢

Area is the land mass of the country,

‚Ä¢

ComCol is a binary variable which is unity if i and j were ever colonies after 1945 with the
same colonizer,

‚Ä¢

CurCol is a binary variable which is unity if i and j are colonies at time t,

‚Ä¢

Colony is a binary variable which is unity if i ever colonized j or vice versa,

‚Ä¢

ComNat is a binary variable which is unity if i and j remained part of the same nation during
the sample (e.g., France and Guadeloupe, or the UK and Bermuda),

‚Ä¢

CU is a binary variable which is unity if i and j use the same currency at time t,

‚Ä¢

Œ≤ is a vector of nuisance coefficients, and

‚Ä¢

Œµ ij represents the myriad other influences on bilateral exports, assumed to be well behaved.
The coefficient of interest to us is Œ≥, the effect of a currency union on trade.
We estimate the model with a number of techniques below. We follow the norm in the

literature by using ordinary least squares, albeit with standard errors which are robust to
clustering (since pairs of countries are likely to be highly dependent across years). However, the
force of the paper rests in employing a number of panel data techniques. We use both fixed and
random effects estimators extensively below. We rely on the robust fixed effects ‚Äúwithin‚Äù
estimator, which essentially adds a set of country-pair specific intercepts to the equation, and
thus exploits only the time series dimension of the data set around country-pair averages.

The Data Set
Rose (2000) exploited a large data set originally developed by the United Nations,
covering 186 countries from 1970 through 1990. In this paper we instead use the CD-ROM
‚ÄúDirection of Trade‚Äù (DoT) data set developed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The DoT data set covers bilateral trade between 217 IMF country codes between 1948
and 1997 (with many gaps). Not all of the areas covered are countries in the conventional sense
of the word; colonies (e.g., Bermuda), dependencies (e.g., Guernsey), territories (e.g., Guam),
overseas departments (e.g., Guadeloupe), countries that gained their independence (e.g., GuineaBissau), and so forth are all included. We use the term ‚Äúcountry‚Äù simply for convenience. (The
countries are listed in Appendix 1.) Bilateral trade on FOB exports and CIF imports is recorded
in American dollars; we deflate trade by the American CPI.4 We create an average value of
bilateral trade between a pair of countries by averaging all of the four possible measures
potentially available.5
To this data set, we add a number of other variables that are necessary to estimate the
gravity model. We add population and real GDP data (in constant dollars) from three sources.
Wherever possible, we use ‚ÄúWorld Development Indicators‚Äù (taken from the World Bank‚Äôs WDI
2000 CD-ROM) data. When the data are unavailable from the World Bank, we fill in missing
observations with comparables from the Penn World Table Mark 5.6, and (when all else fails),
from the IMF‚Äôs ‚ÄúInternational Financial Statistics‚Äù.6 The series have been checked and corrected
for errors.
We exploit the CIA‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorld Factbook‚Äù for a number of country-specific variables.
These include: latitude and longitude, land area, landlocked and island status, physically
contiguous neighbors, language, colonizers, and dates of independence.7 We use these to create
great-circle distance and our other controls. We obtain data from the World Trade Organization
to create an indicator of regional trade agreements, and include: EEC/EC/EU; US-Israel FTA;
NAFTA; CARICOM; PATCRA; ANZCERTA; and Mercosur.8
Finally, we add information on whether the pair of countries was involved in a currency
union. By ‚Äúcurrency union‚Äù we mean essentially that money was interchangeable between the
two countries at a 1:1 par for an extended period of time, so that there was no need to convert
prices when trading between a pair of countries. Our basic source for currency union data is the

5

IMF‚Äôs Schedule of Par Values and issues of the IMF‚Äôs Annual Report on Exchange Rate
Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions. We supplement this with information from annual
copies of The Statesman‚Äôs Yearbook. In the data set, about 1% of the sample covers currency
unions, a proportion comparable to that in Rose, 2000). The currency unions in our data set are
tabulated in Appendix 2. A number of currency unions are sufficiently integrated that trade data
are unavailable; this will tend to bias our estimate of Œ≥ downwards.9
During the sample there were 16 switches into and 130 switches out of currency unions.
Some of these were related (e.g., Bermuda‚Äôs switch from the pound sterling to the American
dollar), and a number are cross-sectionally dependent (e.g., Equatorial Guinea entered the CFA
franc zone and so joined a currency union vis-√†-vis many countries simultaneously). But while
we do not have 146 independent observations on regime transitions, the number is still
substantive. Since we do not have many observations on currency union entries, we treat exits
from and entries into currency unions symmetrically. Our techniques exploit this time series
feature of the data.10
Descriptive statistics for the data set are tabulated in Table 1 for both currency unions and
non-unions. Sample means for the key gravity regressors are broadly similar for currency unions
and non-unions, the exception being the common language and colonial variables.

3: Gravity-Based Estimates of the Effect of Currency Unions on Trade
OLS Estimates
We begin by estimating our gravity equation using conventional OLS (with a full set of
year-specific intercepts added). Results are presented in Table 2.
The gravity model works well in a number of different dimensions. The model fits the
data well, explaining almost two-thirds of the variation in bilateral trade flows. The gravity
coefficients are economically and statistically significant with sensible interpretations. For
instance, economically larger and richer countries trade more; more distant countries trade less.
A common language, land border and membership in a regional trade agreement encourage
trade, as does a common colonial history. The same nation coefficient is not intuitively signed
but is statistically indistinguishable from zero.
The model delivers a Œ≥ estimate of 1.41, an estimate that is comparable to and slightly
higher (in both economic and statistical significance) than that of Rose (2000). The estimate

6

implies that a pair of countries that are joined by a common currency trade about four times as
much with each other (e1.4 ‚âà 4.06), holding other things constant.
It is possible to perform extensive robustness analysis for gravity estimates like those in
Table 2. For instance, we have estimated the model using only the cross-sectional aspects of the
model, ignoring the time series features of our panel data set. When we do this, we find that Œ≥
remains economically and statistically large when estimated on individual years; results are in
Table 3. However, instead of pursuing that tack, we now make the most of the time series
variation in our panel data set.

Fixed Effects Estimates
The fixed effect ‚Äúwithin‚Äù estimator is the most appropriate way to exploit the panel
nature of the data set without making heroic assumptions. It estimates Œ≥ by comparing trade for a
pair of countries before CU creation/dissolution to trade for the same pair of countries after CU
creation/dissolution. There are only two possible drawbacks to the estimator: the impossibility
of estimating time-invariant factors, and a potential lack of efficiency. Since our data set is
large, we are prepared to ignore the latter problem. Since Œ≥ can manifestly (as will be shown
below) be estimated from the time series variation in currency union incidence, the former
problem does not arise.
Above and beyond econometric robustness, the fixed effect estimator has one enormous
advantage. Since the within estimator exploits variation over time, it answers the policy question
of interest, namely the (time series) question ‚ÄúWhat is the trade effect of a country joining (or
leaving) a currency union?‚Äù This can be contrasted with the cross-sectional question ‚ÄúHow
much more do countries within currency unions trade than non-members?‚Äù which was answered
by Rose (2000).
Estimation results are in Table 4. We present the fixed effects estimates of Œ≥ and a few of
the key gravity coefficients in the left-hand column. For comparison, we also tabulate random
effects estimates, using a generalized least squares estimator assuming Gaussian disturbances
that are uncorrelated with the random (country-pair specific) effects. The ‚Äúbetween‚Äù estimator
(which essentially runs a regression on group averages) and a normal maximum likelihood
estimator are also shown at the right-hand side of the table.

7

The fixed effects estimate of Œ≥ is smaller than the OLS estimates of Table 2 and 3. Since
e.74 ‚âà 2.1, the estimate implies that leaving/joining a currency union leads bilateral trade to
fall/rise by about 100%. But this effect is still economically large, and statistically significant at
conventional levels; the t-statistic is over thirteen. The other estimators generate even bigger
estimates of Œ≥. And while the nuisance (Œ≤) coefficients vary between fixed and random effects,
the estimate of Œ≥ is reasonably robust.

Sensitivity Analysis
In Table 5, we provide some sensitivity analysis. We perturb our basic methodology in a
number of different ways, and tabulate estimates of Œ≥ using both fixed and random effects
estimators. In particular: 1) we add a comprehensive set of year-specific controls; 2) instead of
using all years of the sample, we use only the data from every fifth year; 3) we add quadratics of
both output and output per capital; 4) we throw out all industrial country observations (those
with IFS country codes over 200); 5) we throw out all small country observations (those with
GDP<$1 billion); 6) we throw out all poor countries (those with real GDP per capita less than
$1,000); 7) we retain only similarly-sized country-pairs (i.e., those with GDPs which differ by
less than a factor of five); 8) we retain only country-pairs where bilateral trade is a small fraction
(less than 10%) of total trade for both countries; 9) we retain only pre-1974 observations; 10) we
throw out all CFA-Franc observations; and 11) we throw out all ECCB observations, as well as
those which involve the American dollar, the British pound sterling, or the French Franc.11
The results of Table 5 show that Œ≥ is reasonably insensitive to a number of different
perturbations in our methodology. Our fixed effects estimates lie in the relatively narrow range
of (.53, 1.03) and are consistent economically and statistically significant throughout. They are
also consistent close to the random effects estimates of Œ≥.12 Other estimators (such as the panel
estimator tabulated in Table 2, the between and maximum likelihood estimators tabulated in
Table 4) show even higher estimates.13
To summarize: a number of different panel estimators all deliver the conclusion that
currency union has a strong positive effect on trade. We rely most on the fixed effects estimator
since by essentially exploiting the time series variation in currency union arrangements, it is least
demanding in terms of heroic econometric assumptions. Our fixed effects estimates indicate that
entry into/departure from a currency union leads bilateral trade to rise/fall by about 100%,
8

holding a host of other features constant. This result is not only economically and statistically
significant, but seems relatively robust.

Caveats
There are issues associated with the applicability of our results. Since our sample ends
before EMU, most of the currency unions involved countries that were either small, poor, or
both; our results may therefore be inapplicable to EMU. On the other hand, they may be highly
relevant to the many small and/or poor countries considering ‚Äúdollarization‚Äù. Rose and van
Wincoop (2001) attack these issues using a more structural approach that allows for trade
diversion and multilateral spillover effects.
In addition, we treat currency unions as exogenous with respect to trade. There are a
number of reasons to believe this assumption, since there is little evidence that countries have
joined currency unions to increase trade. Nevertheless, some of the apparently large tradecreating effects of currency union may actually be a reflection of reverse causality. Rose (2000)
and L√≥pez-C√≥rdova and Meissner (2001) provide evidence that the effect of monetary union on
trade seems high even after accounting for potential endogeneity; Persson (2001) provides
counter-arguments. But while we doubt the importance of this in practice, we have been unable
to devise a convincing set of instrumental variables while would allow us to quantify this effect.

4. Conclusion
In this paper we used a large panel data set to estimate the time series effect of currency
union on trade. Our data set includes annual bilateral trade between over 230 countries from
1948 through 1997. During this period of time, a number of countries joined or (mostly) left
currency unions. Controlling for a host of other influences through an augmented gravity model,
we find that a pair of countries which joined/left a currency union experienced a doubling in
trade. This result is economically large, statistically significant, and seems insensitive to a
number of perturbations in our methodology.

We treat ‚Äúcommon currencies‚Äù, ‚Äúcurrency unions‚Äù, ‚Äúmonetary unions‚Äù and so forth synonymously.
Walsh (2000) provides time series evidence on the dissolution of the Irish-British common currency.
3
Gravity models have been much discussed in the literature; Rose (2000) provides references.
4
There are a few instances where only FOB imports are available; we then use them instead of CIF imports.
5
Since both exports and imports are measured by both countries, there are potentially four measured bilateral trade
flows: exports from a to b, exports from b to a, imports into a from b, and imports into b from a.
6
The IFS-based series are calculated by converting national currency GDP figures into dollars at the current dollar
exchange rate, and then dividing by the US GDP deflator.
7
The website is: http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook.
8
Since we are not primarily interested in estimating the FTA effect, we treat all FTAs as being equal.
9
These include Andorra-Spain/France; Belgium-Luxembourg; Austria-Liechtenstein; France-Morocco; ItalyVatican; and South Africa-Lesotho/Swaziland/Namibia.
10
These regime switches almost always occur before 1970, so that a time series technique was essentially not
feasible for Rose‚Äôs UN data set.

We have also used different measures of exchange rate stability (e.g., not requiring that the exchange rate between
the countries be 1:1 so long as it is extremely stable) without altering our conclusion that extreme monetary stability
encourages trade.

We have also examined the symmetry of entries into and exits from currency unions, but are stymied by the
paucity of observations on currency union entries (which are outnumbered by exits by a ratio of over 8:1). When we
do separate exits from entries, we find that the exit effect on trade is bigger than the entry effect, though our fixed
effects and OLS estimates (but not the random effects estimate) do not reject equality of entry and exit coefficients
at the .05 significance level. Nevertheless, it should be noted that exits tended to take place early in the sample
while entries occurred late, so the effects of lags (as well as the number of data points) might bias the effect of entry
downwards compared to the effect of entries. It would be interesting to pursue this issue using a methodology that
accounts for the ‚Äúinterrupted spell‚Äù nature of the data, as well as the issues of (possibly non-randomly) missing data
and repeated entries/exits from currency unions.

Also, a random effects estimator corrected for AR(1) disturbances delivers an estimate of Œ≥=.73 with a standard
error of .08.
