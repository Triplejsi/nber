1. The Tariff-Growth Connection

Does protection inhibit growth? While theory may be ambiguous, late 20th century evidence
certainly is not. This evidence can be found in four kinds of studies.1
First, the authors of a large National Bureau of Economic Research project assessed trade and
exchange-control regimes in the 1960s and 1970s by making classic partial-equilibrium calculations of
deadweight losses (Bhagwati and Krueger 1973-1976). They concluded that the barriers imposed
significant costs in all but one case. However, these standard welfare calculations have been criticized by
those who have pointed out that, in such studies, protection is not allowed a chance to lower long-run cost
curves, as in the traditional infant-industry case (Baldwin 1969), or to foster industrialization and thus
growth, as in those modern growth models where industry is the carrier of technological change and capital
deepening. Thus, economists have had to look for more late 20th century proof to support the opennessfosters-growth hypothesis.
Second, analysts have contrasted the growth performance of relatively open with relatively closed
economies. The World Bank has conducted such studies for 41 countries going back before the first oil
shock. The correlation between trade openness and growth is abundantly clear in these studies (Lindert
and Williamson 2001: Table 3), but the analysis is vulnerable to two criticisms. Assigning countries to
trade policy categories is always tricky, since it is hard to measure overall openness (Anderson and Neary
1994; Sachs and Warner 1995). More importantly, it is hard to isolate the effect of trade policies alone,
since other policies usually change at the same time. Liberalism typically comes as a package. Thus,
countries that liberalized their trade also liberalized their domestic factor markets, liberalized their

1

This section relies heavily on the recent survey paper by Peter Lindert and Jeffrey Williamson (2001: pp. 21-25).
We choose to focus on growth effects, in the context of a well-developed literature on postwar trade and growth. We
are aware, however, of a younger literature on the relationship between trade and levels of wealth (notably in Frankel
and Romer 1999, extended back to 1913 by Irwin and Terviö 2001).

1

domestic commodity markets, and set up better property-rights enforcement. The appearance of these
domestic policies may deserve more credit for raising income while the simultaneous appearance of more
liberal trade policies may deserve less.
Third, there are country event studies, where the focus is on periods when trade policy regimes
change dramatically enough to see their effect on growth. For example, Anne Krueger (1983, 1984)
looked at trade opening moments in South Korea around 1960, Brazil and Colombia around 1965, and
Tunisia around 1970. Growth improved after liberalization in all four cases. More recently, David Dollar
and Aart Kraay (2000) examined the reforms and trade liberalizations of 16 countries in the 1980s and
1990s, finding, once again, the positive correlation between freer trade and faster growth. Of course, these
reform episodes may have changed more than just global participation, so that an independent trade effect
may not have been isolated.
Fourth, macro-econometric analysis has been used in an attempt to resolve the doubts left by
simpler historical correlations revealed by the other three kinds of studies. This macro-econometric
literature shows that free trade policies have had a positive effect on growth in the late 20th century,
especially with many other relevant influences held constant. The most famous of these is by Jeffrey Sachs
and Andrew Warner (1995), but many others have also confirmed the openness-fosters-growth hypothesis
for the late 20th century (e.g. Dollar 1992; Edwards 1993; Bloom and Williamson 1998; Dollar and Kraay
2000).

2. The Tariff-Growth Paradox

If free trade has been good for growth since World War II, why was it bad for growth before?
About thirty years ago, Paul Bairoch (1972) argued that protectionist countries grew faster in the
19th century, not slower as every economist has found for the late 20th century. Bairoch’s sample was
2

European, it looked at pre-1914 experience only, and it invoked unconditional analysis, controlling for no
other factors. Like the second group of modern studies listed above, it simply compared growth rates of
major European countries in protectionist and free trade episodes. A decade later, Forrest Capie (1983)
confirmed the Bairoch result with a pre-1914 European sample of four (Germany, Italy, the UK and
Russia), using event analysis. Alfred Eckes (1995) attempted to establish causation from high tariffs to
fast growth for 19th century United States, although his work is assiduously criticized by Douglas Irwin
(2001). Most recently, Kevin O'Rourke (2000) got the Bairoch finding again, this time using macroeconometric conditional analysis on a ten country sample drawn from the pre-1914 Atlantic economy
(Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, UK, US). In short, these four
scholars were not able to find any evidence before World War I supporting the openness-fosters-growth
hypothesis. Another recent study (Vamvakidis 1997) couldn’t find any interwar evidence supporting the
openness-fosters-growth hypothesis either, although it was (once again) based on a small, mostly OECD
sample.
These pioneering historical studies suggest that the Tariff-Growth Paradox should be taken
seriously. Was there a regime switch somewhere between the start of World War I and the end of World
War II, and, if so, when and why? Nobody has yet performed the test consistently and comprehensively
from the mid-19th century to the present, using the same data, the same model, and for a sample that
covers the whole world. Table 1 offers such a test for a sample of 35 countries that will be used
throughout this paper: 4 members of the industrial Core (France, Germany, UK, US); 7 rich European
Offshoots (Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Cuba, New Zealand, Uruguay); 10 from the European
Periphery (Austria-Hungary, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Sweden);
and 14 less developed countries (LDCs) in Asia, the Mideast and Latin America (Brazil, Burma, Ceylon,
China, Colombia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Siam, Turkey). Table 1
uses the average tariff rate as our measure of protection. There is, of course, a well-developed literature
3

that debates how to measure openness (e.g., Anderson and Neary 1994; Sachs and Warner 1995; O’Rourke
1997; Anderson 1998). That literature makes it clear that trade share measures must be rejected since they
are so obviously endogenous. Among the exogenous policy measures available, the average tariff rate is
the easiest to collect.2
The model estimated in Table 1 is of the convergence variety,3 but only conditioned by the tariff
rate. The tariff rate and GDP per capita level are both measured at year t, while the subsequent GDP per
capita growth rate is measured over the half decade following. Thus, the last two pre-World War II
observations are 1934, which relates to growth between 1934 and 1939, and 1908, which relates to the
growth between 1908 and 1913. The two world wars are ignored, and the postwar also reports 1970-1990
to conform with the years studied by Sachs and Warner (1995).
The World War II regime switch and the Tariff-Growth Paradox are both stunningly clear in Table
1. The estimated coefficient on log of the tariff rate is -2.88 for 1950-1998 and -1.39 for 1970-1990, both
highly significant: thus, tariffs were associated with slow growth after 1950. In contrast, the estimated
coefficient is +0.58 for 1865-1908 and +1.31 for 1919-1934, again both highly significant: thus, tariffs
were associated with fast growth before 1939.
This paper will explore whether the Paradox persisted the world around, or whether instead there
was asymmetry between rich industrial economies in the Core and poor agricultural economies in the
Periphery. Presumably, the protecting country has to be ready for industrialization, accumulation, and
human capital deepening if the long run tariff-induced dynamic effects are to offset the short run gains
from trade given up. We test the asymmetry hypothesis by asking whether the Paradox persisted for all

2

The average tariff rate is measured here as customs revenues (import duties only) as a share of total import values.
We use the phrase “exogenous tariff policy” here, but we are very aware of the flourishing endogenous tariff
literature. Indeed, we plan to use our data base to contribute to that literature in another paper.
3

But note that the estimation in Table 1 imposes country fixed effects, so that those negative coefficients on log
initial GDP per capita do not speak to world divergence (“big time”: Pritchett 1997) which took place over most of
this century. We will have more to say about this below.

regions, industrial and primary-product producing. The paper will also ask whether the tariff policies of
trading partners mattered. Were high tariffs at home matched by high tariffs abroad, and did it matter?
Also, did trading partners’ GDP growth improve performance at home? It might be argued that conditions
were less auspicious for trade liberalization as a means of achieving industrialization before 1940 since
there were so few fast-growing export markets for manufactures. A policy of relying on domestic markets
empty of foreign competitors might have had more going for it then. The parallel argument today would
be that although there are fast-growing world markets for manufactures, there are also so many competitors
in those markets that industrial late-comers—like Latin America—suffer, while East Asia benefitted by
going open early without many competitors. Historical timing matters, and this fact might help explain the
Paradox.

3. Country Tariff Experience 1865-1950

Figure 1 plots the worldwide own tariff average, and Figure 2 plots it for the four regional clubs.4
There are four regions plotted there – Core, European Periphery, Rich European Offshoots and LDCs –
the country members of which have already been identified above.
The first thing to note is the powerful role played by inflations and deflations in the past. Import
duties were typically specific until modern times, quoted as pesos per bale, yen per yard, or dollars per bag.
Obviously, abrupt changes in price levels would change import values in the denominator, but not the
legislated specific duty in the numerator, thus producing big equivalent ad valorem rate changes, that is big
changes in percentage rates. Ad valorem rates are more common today, so that equivalent tariff rates are

4

We also have calculated the regional weighted averages for both Figures 2 and 3, where weights are the country’s
total export share in regional exports. The text story is not significantly changed, and we prefer to treat countries as
independent policy units regardless of size. The complete data base used in this paper is described at length in the
Appendix.

less affected by inflation and deflation.5 The impact of inflations during the two world wars were quite
spectacular, and they had nothing to do with policy (except status quo ante). Thus, the tariff rates in all
four regions fell sharply between 1914 and 1919, and again between 1939 and 1947. Part of the rise in
tariffs immediately after World War I was also due to post-war deflation and the partial attainment of
prewar price levels. The price deflation after 1929 was even more spectacular, and it too served to raise
tariffs rates at least on duties that were still specific (import values now declining). The process repeats
during the World War II inflations, but, in contrast, there is no sign of resumption of the very high rates
attained in the 1930s.
Second, note in Figure 1 the protectionist drift worldwide between 1865 and World War I, a
modest anti-globalization backlash if you will, registering a slow retreat from the liberal pro-global trade
positions in mid-century (Williamson 1998).
Third, note too the enormous variance in levels of protection between the regional club averages.
There was, of course, even greater variance within these regional clubs. In 1905, tariffs in Uruguay (the
most protectionist Rich European Offshoot) were about two and a half times those in Canada (the least).
In the same year, tariffs in Brazil and Colombia (the most protectionist LDCs) were almost ten times those
in China and India (the least). The same high-low range appeared in the Core (the US five times the UK)
and the European Periphery (Russia six times Austria-Hungary). The empirical analysis later in this paper
will treat countries as the unit of observation, but for now let’s simply look at the regional clubs.
Prior to World War I, tariffs were much higher in the Rich European Offshoots than anywhere
else. Furthermore, they would have been even higher had we allocated to this club one of the most-

5

We are certainly not the first to notice this effect. Douglas Irwin has made the same point in accounting for US
tariff experience between the Civil War and the Great Depression where “roughly two-thirds of dutiable U.S. imports
were subject to specific or compound duties ...” (Irwin 1998: p. 1017). Although it fell in the 20th century, the share
was still half by the mid-1960s. A compound duty refers to one that imposes both specific and ad valorem duties on
a given import good.

protectionist, the US (which is allocated instead to the Core).6 The European members of the Core
(France, Germany, UK) had the lowest tariffs, although the US serves to raise the club average. Much of
the LDC club members were colonies of the Core (Burma, Ceylon, Egypt, India, Indonesia, the
Philippines), or were forced to sign free trade agreements with the Core since the latter had naval guns
trained on their potential trading partners (China, Japan), or viewed nearby gunboats as a sufficient threat
to go open on their own (Siam). Thus, the LDC tariff rates are pretty much like those of the Core early on,
but they start drifting towards protection in the 1890s, long before the African and Asian independence
movement after World War II. This protectionist drift is due to events in poor Latin America (Brazil,
Colombia, Mexico) as well as in Egypt, Japan, and Turkey (late Ottoman). In 1865, the LDCs had the
lowest tariffs, while in 1914 they were second to the Rich European Offshoots. The European Periphery
leaps to high levels of protection after the 1870s, with Russian protectionist policy leading the way. There
is plenty of evidence of rising world protection before World War I (the unweighted average in the full
sample rising from about 12% in 1865 to about 17% in 1910), and this drift towards more protection
appeared everywhere except the Core (although the slow drift away from protection is driven entirely by
the slow US retreat from its enormous Civil War tariffs), but it took place mainly in the Rich European
Offshoots and the European Periphery. There is also evidence of a worldwide reversal of the pre-war drift
towards protection after about 1900, but it did not include the LDCs which bucked the tide (led by Brazil,
Colombia, Japan and the Philippines).
In the interwar decades, tariffs took two big leaps upward, and these took place world wide. The
first leap was in the 1920s, which might be interpreted as a policy effort to return to 1914 levels. The
second was in the 1930s, with aggressive beggar-my-neighbor policies reinforced by the specific-duty-

6

The US has always presented a problem to historians and economists alike. The canonical frontier economy with
scarce labor and abundant resources, by 1900 it was the world’s industrial leader (Wright 1990) and a central market
for the exports from the rest of the world, especially Latin America. So, while the US was certainly a Rich European
Offshoot, we allocate it to the Core.

deflation effect. While tariffs shot up everywhere, the rank order of the four clubs by level of protection
changed considerably. In 1914, and from high protection to low, the rank order was Rich European
Offshoots, LDCs, European Periphery, and Core. In 1939, it was a tie between Core, Rich European
Offshoots, and LDCs—all now matching the very high levels of protection reached by the Rich European
Offshoots in the 1890s, and the less protectionist European Periphery—which had about regained its prewar tariff levels. This rank order made another even more important change after World War II: the LDCs
rose to the top of the heap and the Rich European Offshoots dropped below both the LDCs and the Core.
While in a sequel to this paper we intend to explore the determinants of protection across countries
between 1865 and 1950, Figure 2 should make it clear that the century before 1950 offers plenty of policy
variance to learn more about the trade-growth connection.
Figure 3 plots a principal-trading-partners’-tariff index for the same regional clubs. It is calculated
like this: first, we identify for each country which countries are its major trading partners (up to five);
second, we calculate exports going to each major trading partner as a share of total country exports going
to all major trading partners; third, we use these shares as weights by which to construct the average tariff
faced by each country. Finally, we construct an unweighted average for each region.7
Figure 3 tells us that in the two decades before World War I, every region faced lower tariff rates
in their main export markets than they themselves erected against competitors in their own markets. The
explanation, of course, is that the main export markets were located in the Core, where tariffs were much
lower. Thus, the Periphery faced lower tariffs than did the Core (for the European Periphery this was true
throughout, but for the LDCs it was true only up to just before 1900, when the US replaced Britain as a
major export market for them). During the interwar, every club faced very similar tariff rates in export

Figure 3 has also been constructed as a weighted average where the averages weight these indices by share of each
country’s exports in total regional club exports. It does not change the story much. See footnote 4.

markets, but those rates were rising very steeply as the Core made the biggest policy switch—compared
with the other three clubs—from free trade to protection.
A well-developed theoretical literature on strategic trade policy8 predicts that nations have an
incentive to inflate their own terms of trade (but thereby lower global welfare) with tariff policy—a classic
prisoner’s dilemma. Inasmuch as favorable terms of trade translate into better growth performance and
tariffs are non-prohibitive, we might expect the association between own tariffs and growth to depend upon
the external tariff environment faced by the country in question. Other impacts upon the terms of trade,
such as growth in export markets or varying transportation costs, could also change the association
between own tariffs and growth in such a framework. Having observed a dramatic shift in the world tariff
environment, we proceed to ask whether or not we can use this fact to help better understand the changing
tariff-growth association.

4. The Pre-World War II Tariff Impact

This paper will use two basic models to explore the issues raised about the Trade-Growth Paradox:
what has been called the accumulation model and what has been called the convergence model.9 Table 2
uses the convergence model to explore regional heterogeneity in overall growth performance and in the
contribution of tariff policy to it.
The estimated own tariff impact repeats the world-wide finding in Table 1 that high tariffs were
associated with good growth before World War II. The coefficient on the own tariff in Table 2 (columns 1
and 3) is +0.21 for 1875-1908 and +0.66 for 1924-1934, both significant. However, when we add the
interaction between region and tariff rate, regional asymmetry appears. Compared with the Core (+0.59

before World War I and +1.92 after), tariffs were associated with much faster growth in the Rich European
Offshoots (+1.53 and +3.08). And compared with the Core, tariffs had a much smaller impact on growth
in the LDCs (+0.59 vs + 0.18 before the War and +1.92 vs +0.69 after). Finally, tariffs had a negative
impact on growth in the European Periphery (-0.17 before the War and -0.52 after), the standard late 20th
century result, but the only region for which that finding holds before World War II.
Before we search for explanations of the regional asymmetry, note what columns 1 and 3 in the
Table 2 tell us about world divergence and convergence. While there was convergence within the Core up
to World War I (Britain’s close competitors were catching up), there was divergence world-wide, and it
was manifested mainly by the falling behind of the European Periphery (-0.69) and the LDCs (-1.10),
confirming Lant Pritchett’s (1997) emphasis that there was “big time” divergence in the half century
before World War I. However, according to column 3 of Table 2 those divergence forces pretty much
evaporated during the Interwar, mostly, one supposes, due to slowdown in the Core, rather than due to
speed up in the Periphery.
Table 3 asks whether the Tariff-Growth Paradox and the regional asymmetry effects disappear
when we control for trading partners’ tariff policies, for trading partners’ growth performance, and for the
industrial sophistication of the country imposing the tariffs. We begin by pointing out that the TariffGrowth Paradox persists: the coefficient is positive in all 14 columns in Table 3 except the last, and is
significant in all 14 except the last two. Furthermore, tariff policy made an important (statistical)
contribution to growth. The third entry (just below the t-statistic) associated with each explanatory
variable is the beta coefficient, and it suggests that protection typically accounted for a quarter to two-fifths
of country GDP per capita growth. Table 3 also replicates regional asymmetry of the tariff impact. For
various samples (dictated by data availability), columns 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 report what we found in
Table 2: namely, a positive impact for the Core, an even bigger positive impact for the Rich European
Offshoots, a much smaller impact in the LDCs, and a negative impact in the European Periphery.
10

Now, does the Paradox or the regional asymmetry evaporate when we control for policy and
growth conditions in each country’s export market? Columns 2 and 9 add the GDP growth performance of
principal trading partners.10 Booming foreign markets did not have a significant effect before World War
I, either in terms of the t-statistic or in terms of the beta coefficient (column 2). We found this result
surprising given the stress which W. Arthur Lewis has placed on this “engine of growth” (Lewis 1978: pp.
67-75). His “engine of growth” only emerges in the interwar years (column 9), when it was significant
and powerful. However, even then, it does not erase the Paradox or the regional asymmetry effect.
Columns 6 and 13 add the influence of tariff levels facing exporters in their main markets abroad. By
themselves, these didn’t matter much before World War I (when they varied around a low average), but
they mattered a great deal in the Interwar (when they varied around a very high average). Thus, and
consistent with the famous accounts of Lewis, Prebisch, Singer and others, the “engine of growth” was
slowing down for the Periphery, partly because growth in export markets was slowing down, and partly
because tariff barriers rose. These effects were big.
We then let the own tariff and principal trading partners’ tariff interact in columns 7 and 14. In the
relatively less-protected pre-1914 world, trading partner tariffs do not appear to have a statistically
significant impact on growth (column 6) but minor tariff wars—i.e. protecting against others’ protection—
hurt growth (column 7). This was not so in the interwar years, when skyrocketing partner tariffs made
protection the only way to survive (column 14). Note that controlling for the interwar interaction between
own and partner tariffs, own tariffs suddenly lose their positive effect on growth; that is, own tariffs helped
growth during the Interwar entirely through the channel of minimizing the crushing impact of others’
protection. Note that the Paradox and the regional asymmetry still persists.

10

Here and everywhere else, growth in the home country (our dependent variable) is measured as growth in per
capita GDP. Growth in trading partner countries, however, is measured as growth in aggregate GDP. The former is
the most appropriate measure of welfare at home; the latter is the most appropriate measure of changing demand
abroad for the home country’s exports.

11

Finally, did the industrial sophistication of the protecting country matter? Yes, it did. As a proxy,
we add in columns 4 and 11 the share of the country’s exports which were primary products. Those
countries who specialized in primary products (and imported manufactures) had significantly lower growth
rates, both before World War I and after. Yet, the Paradox and regional asymmetry still persist.
Table 4 strengthens what we’ve found thus far by replacing the convergence model with the factor
accumulation model (D refers to the percentage change during the five years following the year in
question, KL refers to a proxy for the capital-labor ratio, and RL refers to the land-labor ratio). Table 4
also offers a more detailed assessment of the tariff impact by comparing it with other variables commonly
championed in the growth literature. We begin by noting that the Paradox appears in this model too, so the
finding is not model-specific. However, we also note that GDP growth in each country’s main export
markets has a more powerful and significant impact with this model than with the convergence model. We
have no explanation for this result.
Now, what about comparative importance? In the pre-World War I years, protection takes third
place behind physical capital deepening (DKL) and human capital deepening (school enrollment rates).
Still, the effect is significant and big, and it would be bigger to the extent that the observed accumulation
rates were endogenous (as they surely were) and positively related to protection (which we are less sure
of). Infant mortality, terms of trade improvements and population growth have very small effects by
comparison. In the Interwar, pretty much the same result emerges, except that DRL replaces school
enrollment rates as the second biggest effect.

5. How the Changing World Environment Changed the Tariff-Growth Impact

After World War 1, the positive impact of tariffs on growth appears to wane. Columns 1 and 5 of
Table 5 reveal that the own tariff effect was cut in half in the Interwar, although the effect was still
12

statistically significant and positive. Thus, the Paradox was still present, but it was much less powerful.
Could the tremendous rise in trading partner tariffs (especially in the Core) and the collapse in so many
export markets (especially in the Core) be to blame? That is, could the fact that tariff policies were almost
perfectly correlated explain the result—all rising dramatically in the 1920s and 1930s? We explore this
proposition by first looking at all interwar years combined – the 1920s, the fall into the Depression after
1929, and the recovery from the trough to World War II. It may be a mistake to do so, if things were
different during the beggar-my-neighbor years in the 1930s. Still, we start with the whole Interwar in Table
5, and the last three columns of the table appear to reject the hypothesis that the presence of partner tariffs
and partner growth serve to diminish the magnitude and kill the statistical significance of the interwar tariff
effect. If these outside factors were responsible for undermining the pre-1914 positive tariff-growth effect,
one would have expected exactly the opposite; that is, by controlling for conditions in foreign markets we
should have strengthened the own tariff effect. We did not, at least when we looked at the Interwar as a
whole.
But a very different story emerges when the Interwar period is broken down into two parts. Table 6
divides the period into 1919-1930—which contains the rush to close borders, to delink from world
markets, and the big crash,11 and 1931-1934—which contains years of universally high tariffs and growth
recovery. The expected result now emerges from the 1919-1930 period: when controlling for partner
tariffs by themselves (column 2) or also by partner growth (column 4), the positive own tariff effect on
growth becomes statistically significant and also regains the same magnitude it had before 1914. After
controlling for the influence of a rapidly changing world environment, the Tariff-Growth Paradox emerges
alive and well in the interwar decades.

11

Recall that the dependent variable is average growth during the five years after the year in question, thus the 1930
data point covers the nadir of recession in 1933.

13

The source of that ambiguity in Table 5 is now clearer: the complicating years are those of initial
recovery from the Great Depression when tariff walls were high everywhere. Own tariffs still helped
growth after 1931 (column 5; albeit to a lesser degree than before), but external effects are no longer
statistically significant and do not help explain why the positive tariff-growth effect has decreased. Figure
3 suggests why the 1930s were so different. Under the universally high tariff barriers of this autarkic
period between 1931 and 1939, there may not be sufficient variance in partner tariffs to capture their
effect. Furthermore, those barriers shut out the effects of partner growth everywhere.
Have we simply divided up the Interwar in a fortuitous way that conveniently gives us the
expected result? Table 7 shows what happens to Table 5 when we control for the business cycle over the
whole interwar period, that is, merging the 1920s and 1930s again. The regressor CYC is calculated
precisely as it was in O’Rourke (2000): it is the difference between actual and trend growth, where the
latter is predicted from a simple model in which observed growth is regressed on time and time squared.
That is, CYC measures short run deviations from long run growth trends. After we control for the Great
Depression, the positive impact of own tariffs on growth (absent from column 8 in Table 5, and from
column 8 in Table 6 ), returns (column 8 in Table 7). Furthermore, principal trading partners’ tariff is now
negative and highly significant. These results support our contention that the Table 6 separation of the
1930s from the 1920s is essential to understanding the Paradox.
Table 7 also addresses the possibility of an endogeneity bias in Tables 1-6. O’Rourke discusses a
potential mechanism of reverse causation between our tariff regressor and what we take to be the
dependent variable, GDP growth. In his narrative, prices go up in booms, eroding the share of import
duties in total import values during a period when such duties were collected as specific tariffs. Growth
subsequently slows down in the slump following the boom and prices fall, so that low tariffs are
associated, spuriously, with poor growth. Controlling for booms and busts in Table 7 does not, however,

14

diminish the positive tariff effect on growth either before 1914 (Table 7, column 4) or after 1918 (Table 7,
column 8), once we account for partner tariffs.
Table 8 uses CYC in a slightly different way to reveal that countries were, indeed, “beggaring their
neighbors” during the massive interwar global shutdown. The sign on the interaction of own tariffs with
CYC suggests that although tariffs didn’t help more during recessions than in booms before 1914 (column
3), they certainly did when the Depression hit (column 6) and especially during recovery in the 1930s
(column 7). The interaction term in columns 6 and 7 means that, controlling for the large run-up in trading
partner tariffs, countries that had been hit hardest by the crash grew faster in the 1930s with high tariffs
than with low tariffs. The “beggar thy neighbor” policy may have exported depression, but it helped get
rid of it at home. The beta coefficients imply that a one standard deviation decrease in CYC combined
with a one standard deviation increase in tariffs (a 9.1% increase in the level of import duties over imports)
was associated with 0.44 standard deviations better growth performance (+1.25% in average annual
growth) during the 1930s.
Although the nature of the association between high tariffs and fast growth appears to have
changed during the Interwar, it lived on; the positive pre-1914 tariff-growth association remained robust.

6. What Changed after 1950?

We arrive, then, at the paradox. While the positive association between protection and growth
before 1939 doggedly refuses attempts to make it go away, the negative association after 1950 also refuses
to disappear. Tables 5 and 6 suggest a line of inquiry: if changing world conditions were able to alter the
positive tariff-growth effect during the Interwar, perhaps an even bigger change in the period since 1950
could have transformed the once helpful tariff into a burden. If so, exactly which evolving aspects of the
global trade environment were responsible for the regime shift?
15

We begin, logically, with the exact specification and data employed by Sachs and Warner (1995,
Table 11 loc. cit.). We start from here because (since Barro 1991) this particular macro-growth regression
framework has become the most familiar one and because the Sachs-Warner work is so widely cited. It
will soon become clear, however, that we will need to move beyond this Sachs-Warner platform to grapple
with the Paradox. Table 9 recreates different versions of the Sachs and Warner analysis,12 substituting our
own tariff rate (averaged across 1970-1989) for their OPEN dummy. The dependent variable is average
annual growth during the period 1970-1989. We find no positive effect from tariffs; rather, we find a
negative one, and it is powerful in terms of beta coefficients. This is to be expected, since average tariff
rates were one of five factors that Sachs and Warner used to construct OPEN.13 Note, however, that the
tariff effect is strongly negative only when we control for the world environment, a conclusion reached by
comparing columns 4 and 6. Furthermore, the inclusion of initial GDP per capita and other covariates
(especially education) appear to sap the explanatory power of tariffs in columns 1-4. Why? Figure 4
suggests an answer: the richest and most educated countries were also those with the lowest tariff barriers
during this period, so multicollinearity could be inflating the standard errors. The only way around this
problem is to expand the sample, which we will do presently.
This initial experiment with the familiar Sachs-Warner framework is suggestive. The interaction
between own and trading partner tariffs in Table 9's column 7 is positive, and we think this is central. A
glance back to Figure 1 reveals that at the beginning of the time period analyzed by Sachs and Warner,
worldwide tariffs began to drop from a high post-war plateau,14 reaching levels in the late 1970s as low as

12

POL is a composite variable indicating extreme political repression and unrest. PRI70 and SEC70 are the primary
and secondary school enrollment rates in 1970. GVXDXE is government consumption as a fraction of GDP, net of
military and education spending. REVCOUP and ASSASSP respectively measure revolutions/coups per year and
assassinations per capita during the period. PPI70DEV measures the relative price of investment goods. INV7089
is GDI/GDP, and POP60LAND is the 1960 population density.
13
The other four include non-tariff barriers such as quotas, restrictions to the convertibility of currency, socialist
government, and a state monopoly on major exports.
14
It stayed on a high plateau between 1950 and 1970 since the move to free trade within the OECD was offset by a
move to protection in Latin America, Asia and Africa. Only later (in the period analyzed by Sachs and Warner) did

16

those of the liberal 1860s. The positive interaction term suggests that tariffs help only when others have
them too. Since tariffs have been lower than ever before since the 1970s, perhaps that explains why own
tariffs don’t help much anymore.
The beta coefficient in column 2 of Table 9 suggests that a one standard deviation increase in own
tariffs (+8.7% in terms of import duties over imports) would decrease average annual growth 1970-89 by
0.15 standard deviations (a decrease of 0.3% in average annual growth performance over 19 years). But
the beta coefficients of column 6 indicate that if the same increase in own tariffs were accompanied by a
two standard deviation increase in average trading partner tariffs (+4.4% in terms of import duties over
imports) then the net effect on growth would be (just) positive. The multicollinearity problem, however,
requires a bigger and better sample in order to analyze this explanation in more detail.
Thus, Table 10 adopts a new specification and a new dataset. The data, described in detail in the
Appendix, are taken from the World Bank and United Nations. They are annual, cover the full halfcentury between 1950 and 1997, include up to 110 countries in a given year, and will give us a much better
chance to isolate the tariff effect. Before we do so, however, it is important to explore the new data with
the old Sachs-Warner specification and their shorter time period. We do so in columns 1-5. The tariff
effect is of similar significance and magnitude to that seen in Table 9 – perhaps even a little bigger on both
counts, and little changes when we take the log of the tariff rate to make these results commensurable with
previous tables. Despite the fact that the model has fundamentally changed and that the sources for all data
except tariffs are different, the significance and impact of the tariff regressor has not changed in any real
sense.
Columns 6-8 use the same specification to explore medium run growth, covering three more
postwar decades, and with country fixed effects. In columns 1-5 the dependent variable is average annual
growth over the two decades 1970-1989, but in columns 6-8 it is instead average annual growth 1950-1997

the followers chase the leaders.

17

during the half-decade following the year in question. The finer grain of these data lifts the negative
association between tariffs and growth above the fog of multicollinearity. The magnitude of the impact, as
measured by the beta coefficient, is identical to what we saw when using the Sachs and Warner data and
specification, but using annual data over a much longer postwar period allows us to properly assess its
significance. Compare columns 5 and 7: the log of the tariff rate is negative and insignificant 1970-1989,
but negative and very significant 1950-1997. However, and once again, the changing world tariff
environment appears capable of explaining the negative growth impact of tariffs. That is, adding the tariff
index for trading partners and its interaction with the own tariff makes all the difference: the coefficient on
the log of the own tariff rate switches sign (but loses significance). The beta coefficients of column 8 also
suggest that the medium-term growth impact of tariffs is more susceptible to world environment than the
long-term impact seen in Table 9.
A quantitative example is once again enlightening. The beta coefficients of column 7 in Table 10
show that a one standard deviation increase in logged own tariffs (equivalent to +3.6% in terms of import
duties over imports) in a given year was associated with a 1.1% drop in average annual growth during the
subsequent five year period.15 But the beta coefficients of column 8 imply that just over a one standard
deviation increase in average trading partner tariffs (+4.0% in terms of import duties over imports) would
be sufficient to (just) offset such a change. In rough terms: after 1950, raising tariffs by 4% would hurt
growth, unless everyone were doing the same—in which case the 4% rise in own tariffs would actually
help medium-term growth relative to the counterfactual.
We hypothesize, then, that currently low levels of trading partner tariffs explain why the
association between own tariffs and growth switched from positive to negative over the past century.

15

We emphasize that these numbers are not strictly comparable with the magnitude of the effect seen in the Sachs
and Warner framework, since the former captures short-term fluctuations and the latter only long-term swings.

18

Table 11 puts this hypothesis to the test, alongside competing explanations.16 Columns 1-3 test the whole
1950-1997 sample, column 4 tests only the Sachs-Warner period 1970-1989, and column 5 limits the
1950-1997 test to only those 35 countries we examined in the pre-World War I period.
The first competing explanation for the Tariff-Growth Paradox is that countries with access to
high-growth markets for their exports in the postwar boom were able to grow faster, and entered into
mutual tariff-reduction agreements in order to gain such access. Their growth, then, would be negatively
correlated with tariffs due to a change in the growth performance of their trading partners. In this case, we
could expect a positive coefficient on average trading partner growth and a negative interaction between
tariffs and the partner growth effect. We do, in fact, observe these in Table 11.17
The second alternative explanation is that a large decline in world transportation costs
differentiates the present day from the pre-1914 era. Average effective distance from trading partners,
measured as the product of physical distance and a transportation cost index and weighted by exports to

16

In choosing among available datasets for the analysis of Tables 10 and 11, we had to make a tradeoff between
coverage and quality. As of this writing, the Summers and Heston dataset is only available publicly in a form that
extends through 1992, and since our dependent variable measures growth in the five years following the year in
question, using these data would mean ignoring tariff behavior after 1987. For this reason we use IMF data on real
GDP per capita growth, which cover through the present day (as well as more countries). Using IMF growth data
has the additional advantage of limiting the number of different data sources we use, since we are already employing
IMF trade flow data in the construction of the trading partner averages. Cognizant of the superior quality of the
Summers and Heston growth numbers, however, we tested our results for sensitivity to using them instead. In fact,
there are no substantive changes. If we use the Summers and Heston growth numbers for the period 1970-1987 on
the left-hand side in Table 11 (thus working with, in rough terms, an annual version of the Sachs and Warner
dataset), then: 1) the interaction term between own tariffs and partner tariffs is still positive and statistically
significant, 2) the other interaction terms have the same sign shown in Table 11, and 3) the beta coefficients on the
interaction terms are also similar—with the beta coefficient on the partner tariff interaction term being far larger than
that on the partner growth and partner effective distance interaction terms. In brief, using the Summers and Heston
growth numbers changes nothing about the conclusions reached in Table 11.
17
Note that the sign on logged own tariffs is positive after including the interaction terms, in columns 2 through 5.
This does not mean that the own tariff effect is positive; indeed we see in column 1 of Table 11 as well as all of
Table 10 that it is negative, statistically significant, and economically powerful. Rather, in the presence of the
interaction term this positive coefficient represents in some sense a “baseline” value of the tariff effect, which is
modified in the ways indicated by the various interaction terms to arrive at the net effect seen in column 1. For
example, the positive coefficient on own tariffs in column 3 of Table 11 implies that, even after 1950, countries
which faced sufficiently high trading partner tariffs, and/or sufficiently low trading partner growth, and/or sufficient
high effective distance from trading partners, could in fact experience a positive effect of own tariffs on mediumterm growth. On the whole, however, growth was hurt by tariffs during this period, since the conditions described

19

each trading partner, has declined for all countries since 1950. Perhaps the shrinking globe has meant that
protectionists forego greater opportunities than they did in a less interconnected age. Were this true, we
would expect a negative coefficient on effective distance and a positive interaction with tariffs; declining
effective distance should make tariffs hurt growth more. Again, Table 11 confirms the effect.
A third competing hypothesis is that the rising postwar importance of non-tariff barriers (like
quotas and currency restrictions) killed the positive association between tariffs and growth observed before
World War II. This view would hold that tariffs are negatively correlated with growth today primarily
because they serve as a proxy for omitted domestic economic liberalization indicators, and that tariffs per
se have dwindling importance. Were this true, we would expect the inclusion of the Sachs-Warner OPEN
variable to diminish the magnitude and significance of the tariff impact. We do not observe this; compare
the beta coefficient on own tariffs from column 6 of Table 10 (-0.199) with that of column 1 in Table 11 (0.227). Both are highly statistically significant, but the latter controls for OPEN and the former does not.
Apparently, the inclusion of OPEN has not diminished the importance of tariffs. We might, however,
expect tariffs to hurt growth more in more OPEN economies. A simultaneous increase in tariffs and
OPEN would mean that quotas are being eliminated, currency exchange liberalized, and major exporters
privatized, but at the same time large tariff walls are being erected. Such a process might generate
inefficient rents for protected sectors able to take advantage of an otherwise open economy, skewing the
distribution of income towards politically powerful industries and potentially harming overall growth. Of
course, we rarely see tariffs and OPEN rising or falling together.
In short, we find evidence in support of the first and second, but not the third, competing
hypothesis. That is, changes in partner growth and effective distance to partners after 1950 are able to
explain part of the shift from a positive to a negative effect of own tariffs on growth, just as changing
partner tariffs can explain part of the same shift. Which of these three forces, was the most important?

did not hold.

20

Columns 3-5 of Table 11 make it clear that none of the competing explanations has the same explanatory
power as that which asserts that the world tariff environment has been the key reason for the changing
association between own tariffs and growth. A comparison of the beta coefficients on all the relevant
interaction terms reveals that declining partner tariffs are capable of pushing the positive association
between own tariffs and growth the furthest into the negative range. In column 3, the beta coefficient on
the interaction between partner tariffs and own tariffs is 0.57; for partner growth the corresponding number
is –0.31, and for effective distance it is 0.18. An increase in own tariffs after 1950 hurt growth, but they
would not have hurt growth in a hypothetical world in which trading partners’ tariffs were higher, trading
partners’ growth were lower, and/or trading partners were more “effectively distant” (i.e., transportation
costs were higher). Among these, the magnitude of the first effect is greatest. This conclusion does not
change for column 4, where we restrict the time period to 1970-89, nor for column 5, where we restrict the
sample of countries to the same 35 analyzed before 1950.

7. Other Explanations for the Tariff-Growth Paradox

There is certainly no shortage of potential explanations for the post-1950 change in the tariffgrowth relationship that do not require an appeal to a changing world environment. These include:
Tariffs don’t matter much today since non-tariff barriers are so much more important. The
evidence in Table 11 rejects this view: the negative tariff effect survives the addition of OPEN, the SachsWarner multi-component variable that includes non-tariff barriers, socialist interventions, and currency
convertibility restrictions. Own tariff and OPEN are, of course, correlated (partial correlation coefficient 0.369 across all countries and all years). But when both are included in the regression, one would expect
OPEN to capture solely non-tariff effects. The beta coefficient on OPEN in column 1 of Table 11 is not

21

larger in magnitude than that on own tariffs, suggesting that tariffs share comparable importance with nontariff barriers.
Tariffs matter early in the industrialization process, when they protect infant industries, but not
later when economies are more mature. The evidence seems to be inconsistent with this view too. When
the sample underlying column 1 Table 11 is restricted to only developing countries (arbitrarily, GDP per
capita less than $3,500) the magnitude of the negative tariff effect is still large and still statistically
significant. Since the effect does not reverse when considering only those countries which today are at an
early stage of industrialization, it seems unlikely that this explanation could account for the difference
between pre-1914 and today. Of course, the explanation may certainly help explain why there was
regional asymmetry before 1914—very weak or no positive tariff-growth effects in the Periphery—to the
extent that these countries were then clearly pre-industrial and incapable of modern economic growth.
Before 1914, governments that protected spent tariff revenues well on activities that promoted
growth; in today’s protected LDCs, governments squander tariff (and other) revenue on graft and other
unproductive activities. Although we can only tangentially address this issue, we do see in Table 9 that
the tariff effect survives inclusion of government consumption spending as a fraction of GDP net of
military and education spending (GVXDXE).
There was a shift in the type of goods to which tariffs were applied, and tariffs on different
goods have different effects on growth. Our data do not permit a test of this hypothesis since our tariff
figures are aggregate. Yet Tables 5, 6, 9, and 10 all show how changing world environment can explain
the changing influence of own tariffs, without recourse to tariff data disaggregated by product.

8. Conclusion

We find that the best explanation for the Tariff-Growth Paradox is the fact that since the second
22

World War, tariff barriers faced by the average exporting country have fallen to their lowest levels in a
century and a half. After accounting for this change, there is no incompatibility between the less wellknown positive tariff-growth correlation before 1914 and the very well-known negative tariff-growth
correlation since 1970. Other potential explanations cannot compete.
In a larger sense, we find that it has not always been true that protected countries finish last, and
it need not be true in the future either. There is growing evidence suggesting that the benefits of
openness, one of the cornerstones of the Washington Consensus and the GATT/WTO negotiations, are
neither inherent nor irreversible but rather depend upon the state of the world. In a very real sense,
heads of state considering the move to openness are facing a game, rather than an isolated decision.
In such a world, the low-level equilibrium of mutually high tariffs is only as far away as some
big world event that persuades influential leader-countries to switch to anti-global policies. Feedback
ensures that the rest must follow in order to survive. As well, the high-level equilibrium of low tariffs
we now enjoy was only as far away as the nascent OECD coordination of the early postwar years, and
the creation of trans-national public institutions whose express purpose was to impede the return to
interwar autarky.
But what sparks such shifts from one equilibrium to another? Who leads and who follows?
Why did it happen in the 1920s and 1950s—and could it happen again? In forthcoming work, tariffs will
migrate from the right hand side of our regressions to the left, and we will use an expanded version of
our dataset to describe and explain the dynamics of these changes.

Data Appendix
PART I: BEFORE 1950

Data for most variables for the period 1865-1913 come from Michael A. Clemens and Jeffrey G.
Williamson, “Where did British Foreign Capital Go? NBER Working Paper 8028, National Bureau of
Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts (December 2000), which has a comprehensive appendix
describing sources and methods. What follows dwells on 1914-1940 and on variables either missing from
Clemens and Williamson or having been replaced by another source.
A number of sources are used frequently. They are: Arthur S. Banks, Cross-National Time Series,
1815-1973, [Computer File], ICPSR ed. (Ann Arbor, Michigan: Inter-University Consortium for Political
and Social Research, 1976); Brian R. Mitchell, International Historical Statistics, Europe, 1750-1988
(New York: Stockton Press, 1992); Brian R. Mitchell, International Historical Statistics: The Americas,
1750-1988 (New York: Stockton Press, 1993); Brian R. Mitchell, International Historical Statistics:
Africa, Asia & Oceania, 1750-1993 (New York: Stockton Press, 1998).

Average Tariff Rates: Import Duties over Imports
Average tariff rates are calculated as the total revenue from import duties divided by the value of
total imports in the same year. In some cases, the sources used do not distinguish between import and
export duties, and report total customs duties only. Total customs duties are used in the calculation of
average tariff rates (instead of import duties) for countries where the value of export duties has historically
been an insignificant share of total customs duties. Sometimes, the value of import duties collected is
reported for fiscal years, while import data generally refer to calendar years. While making a consistent
effort to compare calendar year duties to calendar year imports, in cases where calendar year duties figures
are unavailable, fiscal year duties are divided by calendar year imports to calculate average tariff. (In these
instances, fiscal year import duties are assumed to belong to the calendar year in which most of the fiscal
year falls).
Argentina: Average tariff figures for 1914-1930 are taken from Rosemary Thorp, “Economy,
1914-29,” in Leslie Bethel (ed), Latin America: Economics and Society 1870-1930 (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1989), p. 77, Diagram: "Tariffs as a percentage of import value, 1910-30".
Figures for 1931-1937 come from Memoria de la Contaduria General de la Nacion, Volume 1 (Buenos
Aires: Ministerio de Hacienda, various issues), 1931: p. 43, 1932: p. 115, 1934: p. 137, 1935: p. 159,

A-1

1937: p. 177. Import duties for 1933 and 1936 and import figures for 1931-1937 are taken from El
Comercio Exterior Argentino (Buenos Aires: various issues), 1933: p. 57, 1937: p. 61. Data for 1938-40
are from the United Nations Statistical Yearbook (Statistical Office of the United Nations, Department of
Economic Affairs, New York, 1951), with imports on pp. 364-88, and customs duties on pp. 474-520. The
yearbook asserts that “wherever the distinction is of quantitative importance, customs duties are subdivided
into import and export duties" (p. 472).
Australia: Customs import duties and total imports are reported in the Official Year Book of the
Commonwealth of Australia (Canberra: Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics, Government
Printer, various issues), 1915: p. 567, 1916: p. 595, 1917: p. 591, 1918: p. 616, 1919: p. 596, 1920: p. 616,
1921: p. 533, 1922: p. 502, 1927: p. 216 and 352, 1929: p. 227 and 350, 1933: p. 258, 1937: p. 520, 1941:
p. 678. Import duties after 1930 include the so-called “primage duty” collected on Australian imports.
Average tariff rates used in Clemens and Williamson (2000) were replaced for 1901-1913 with annual
figures from Mitchell (1998).
Austria: Figures for 1922-1937 are taken from Mitchell (1992).
Brazil: Figures for 1914-1930 come from Bethel (1989), p. 77 (Diagram: "Tariffs as a percentage
of import value, 1910-30"). For 1931-1936, import duties (“direitos de importacao para consumo”) are
taken from Contadoria Central da Republica, Balanco Geral da Uniao, 1936 (Imprensa Nacional, Rio de
Janeiro, 1937), p. 136, while the value of total imports are from Comercio Exterior do Brazil, 1933-37
(Rio de Janeiro: Servico de Estadistica Economica E Financeira do Tresouro Nacional, Ministerio da
Fazenda), p. 3. The ratio of “import taxes” and imports for 1937-1940 is calculated from A. K. Ludwig,
Brazil: A Handbook of Historical Statistics (Boston: G.K. Hall & Co., 1985), p. 314 (imports) and p. 354
(“import taxes”).
Burma: Imports are reported annually and customs duties for every fifth year in Teruko Saito and
Lee Kin Kiong, Statistics on the Burmese Economy (Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies,
1999), p. 175 (imports) and p. 201 (customs duties). Thus, average tariff rates are calculated for every fifth
year and the missing years are interpolated geometrically.
Canada: Figures for 1867-1913 come from Mitchell (1993). For 1914-40, figures are taken from
M. C. Urquhart and K. A. H. Buckley, Historical Statistics of Canada (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1965), p. 173 (imports) and pp. 197-8 (“customs import duties”).
Ceylon: Figures for 1925-1940 come from Thirty Years of Trade Statistics of Ceylon (1925-54),
(Colombo: Department of Commerce, Part 1, 1955), p. 1 (“merchandise imports”) and p. 2 (“customs
duties on imports”). Average tariff rates for 1921 and 1922 are calculated using the Annual General

A-2

Report (Colombo: Government Record Office, various issues), 1922: pp. 21-22 and 1923: p. 10.
According to the figures in the Annual General Report, the value of export duties in Ceylon was almost
exactly one third of the value of import duties in 1921-1923. Therefore, Ceylon’s average tariff rate for
1914-1920 is estimated as follows: customs duties reported in Patrick Peebles, A Handbook of Historical
Statistics (Boston: G.K. Hall & Co., 1982), pp. 236-7, are multiplied by : to get an estimated value of
import duties; then the estimated import duties are divided by the value of merchandise imports given in
the Thirty Years of Trade Statistics of Ceylon (1955), p. 1.
Chile: Figures for 1914-1930 are taken from Markos J. Mamalakis, Historical Statistics of Chile
(New York: Greenwood Press, 1989), vol. 6, p. 206. Figures for 1940-1950 are from Mamalakis, vol. 1,
pp. 67-8 (import duties) and p. 85 (imports). Figures for 1931-1939 are calculated as follows. Customs
duties for 1930-1940 are from Mamalakis, vol. 6, pp. 506-7, while imports are found in Banks (1976) and
converted to current pesos with the exchange rates in Bryan Taylor, Encyclopedia of Global Financial
Markets, Seventh Edition (Los Angeles: Global Financial Data, 2000). According to Mamalakis, vol. 1, pp.
67-8, the value of export duties in Chile was consistently well under 1% of that of import duties, so using
the sum of import and export duties for 1931-1939 in our calculations seems justified. Figures for 19311939 are estimated assuming that average tariff levels between 1930-1940 deviate from their trend (based
on Mamalakis’ figures for the years 1930 and 1940) in the same way (percentage-wise) as the tariff levels
calculated from the Mamalakis customs duties and Banks imports deviate from their trend.
China: The treaties of Nanking (1843) and Tientsin (1858), as well as other similar treaties,
limited the Chinese ad valorem tariff rate on imports from essentially all of Europe to 5%. However, the
treaties (and their revisions in 1870, 1902, 1917, and 1922) did not set ad valorem tariffs. Rather, they set
specific nominal duties that, although initially equivalent to a 5% ad valorem tariff, rapidly declined in
effective value as prices rose (C. F. Remer, The Foreign Trade of China (Shanghai: The Commercial Press
Ltd., 1926), pp. 171-81). “The average effective rates were often below three percent and were never
above four percent even in the years immediately following the revisions” (Yu-Kwei Cheng, Foreign
Trade and Industrial Development of China (Seattle, Wash.: The University Press, 1956, pp. 8-13). For
this reason it is assumed that import-duties-over-imports for China started at 4% in each year and declined
at a constant rate to 2.5% in the year immediately preceding the next revision.” (Clemens and Williamson
2000). Due to China’s joining World War I, one such tariff revision took place in 1918. “But that revision
proved inadequate since the yield at the time of the Washington Conference of 1921-1922 was estimated at
only about 3 per cent. The Conference agreed to immediate revision to an effective 5 per cent" (Arthur N.
Young, China's Nation-Building Effort, 1927-37 (Stanford, Cal.: Hoover Institution Press, 1971), p. 18).

A-3

Finally, through negotiations the Nationalist government obtained tariff autonomy by 1929, which changed
Chinese tariffs greatly. Young (1971) reports imports (pp. 492-3) and import duties (p. 52) for the period
1927-1937. The average tariff rates take account of Manchuria’s foreign trade until 1931.
Colombia: Figures for 1924-40 are taken from the Anuario General de Estadistica (Bogata:
Imprenta Nacional, various issues), which report customs duties (impuestos aduanas y recargos, 1935: pp.
296-7, 1951-1952: p. 281) and imports (1929: p. 364, 1935: p. 202, 1951-1952: p. 173).
Cuba: Figures for 1928-40 are taken from S. Schroeder, Cuba: A Handbook of Historical
Statistics (Boston: G.K. Hall & Co., 1982), p. 470.
Denmark: Figures for 1865-1913 come from Mitchell (1992). Figures for 1914-40 are taken from
Hans Chr. Johansen, Dansk Historisk Statistik (Danish Historical Statistics), 1814-1980 (Copenhagen:
Gyldendal, 1985), where total merchandise imports (“samlet vareindforsel”, pp. 196-7) and customs duties
(“told”, pp. 327 and 330) are reported.
Egypt: Figures for 1884-1935 are taken from the Annual Statement of the Foreign Trade of Egypt
(Cairo: Statistical Department, Ministry of Finance, 1935), where “duty collected on imports” (of
merchandise) is given on p. 6. Figures for 1938-1940 are from the United Nations Statistical Yearbook
(1951). Figures for the period 1936-1937 are obtained through geometric interpolation.
France: Figures for 1865-1913 are from Mitchell (1992). Figures for 1914-1940 are taken from
the Annauire Statistique, (Paris: Ministre des Finances et de Affaires Economiques, Impremerie Nationale,
1951), which reports total imports (pp. 190-1) and import duties (“droits d’importation”, p. 321).
Germany: Figures for 1880-1940 come from Mitchell (1992). Nonetheless, the following sources
were also used to convince ourselves of the validity of the Mitchell figures: Deutsche Wirtschaftskunde
(Berlin: Statistischen Reichsamt, Verlag von Reimer, Hobbing, 1933), pp. 119, 316, 336; Otto Nathan,
The Nazi Economic System (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1944), p. 320; Statistisches
Jahresbuch für das Deutsche Reich (Berlin: Statistisches Reichsamt, various issues). Since the fragmented
data in these sources on imports (“Einfuhr”) and customs import duties (“Zölle” or “Zollerträge”) match
the figures in Mitchell (1992), the latter was used 1880-1940 for continuity.
Greece: Figures for 1911-1939 are taken from Statistique du Commerce de La Grece avec Les
Pays Etranges, Volume I. (Athens: Impremerie Nationale, 1939), which gives imports (p. 4) and import
duties (“droits d’importacion,” p. 31).
India: Figures for 1910-1934 come from the Statistical Abstract of British India (London: His
Majesty's Stationery Office, various issues), 1910-1920: pp. 62 and 152-3, 1920-1930: pp. 212-4 and 5345, 1926-1936: pp. 404-6 and 824-5. In this source, duties on imports by sea and total imports by sea are

A-4

reported. The use of sea trade data to calculate average tariff levels seems justified given that customs
revenues from land trade represented only about 0.5% of the customs duties on sea trade, and land imports
were well under 10% of sea-borne imports. Figures for 1935-1940 are from the Review of the Trade of
India (Delhi: Department of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, various issues), 1936-1937: pp. 32
and 263, 1937-1938: pp. 78 and 277, 1940-1941: pp. 101 and 249.
Indonesia: Figures for 1914-1939 are from W. L. Korthals Altes, Changing Economy in
Indonesia: Volume 12a, General Trade Statistics 1822-1940, (Amsterdam: Royal Tropical Institute,
1991), pp. 54-6 (imports) and pp. 187-8 (import duties). Figures for 1940 are taken from the Statistical
Pocket Book of Indonesia (Jakarta: Biro Pusat Statistik, 1957), p. 99 (imports) and p. 173 (import duties).
Italy: Figures for 1865-1913 are from Mitchell (1992). For 1914-1940, the data come from
Thelma Liesner, One Hundred Years of Economic Statistics (New York: Facts on File, 1989), pp. 244-7.
Japan: Figures for 1865-1891 are from Mitchell (1998). Figures for 1892-1940 are taken from
Japan Statistical Yearbook (Tokyo: Sorifu, Tokeikyoku, 1949), p. 471. Figures for 1866, and 1893-1896
are obtained through geometric interpolation.
Mexico: Figures for 1925-1937 come from the Anuario Estadistico (Mexico D. F.: Estados
Unidos Mexicanos Secretario de la Economia Nacional Direccion General de Estadistica, various issues),
reporting Mexican import duties (“impuestos a la importation,” 1930: p. 517, 1938: pp. 280-1, 1940: p.
741) and imports (1938: p. 247, 1940: p. 654). Figures for 1938-1940 are from the United Nations
Statistical Yearbook (1951). Figures for the extended civil war period, 1913-1924, are estimated through
geometric interpolation.
New Zealand: Figures are taken from the Official Year Book of New Zealand (Wellington:
Government Printer, various issues), including 1894: p. 132 and endsheet, 1928: p. 341, 1932: p. 281,
1935: p. 233, 1938: p. 270, 1941: p. 249. Figures for 1865-1885 were estimated by assuming that tariff
revenue represented the same average fraction of total tax revenue during 1865-1885 as it did 1886-1892
(i.e. roughly 70%). The assumption is justified by the facts that a) this fraction was essentially constant on
the period 1886-1892, and that b) this fraction back in 1851-1852 was also roughly 70% (endsheet of the
1894 edition of the Official Year Book has figures for 1851-1852).
Norway: Figures for 1865-1940 are from Mitchell (1992). The Historisk Statistikk (Oslo: Central
Bureau of Statistics of Norway, 1978), pp. 261 and 446, was also used to check the validity of Mitchell’s
data.
Peru: Figures for 1914-1930 come from Bethel (1989), p. 77 (Diagram: "Tariffs as a percentage
of import value, 1910-30"). Figures for 1931-37 are taken from the Extracto Estadistico del Peru (Lima:

A-5

Preparado por la Direccion Nacional de Estadistica, 1938) reporting customs duties (“impuestas aduanas,”
p. 402) and total imports (p. 212). Data for 1938-40 are from the United Nations Statistical Yearbook
(1951).
The Philippines: Figures for 1914-1940 come from the Annual Report of the Insular Collector of
Customs (Manila: Bureau of Printing, 1937 and 1940), where import duties (1940: pp. 359-60) and
imports (1937: pp. 66-7, 1940: p. 15) are presented.
Portugal: Average tariff levels are taken from Joao Luis Cesar das Neves, The Portuguese
Economy: A Picture in Figures (Lisbon: Universidade Catolica Editora, 1994). The graph on p. 149
illustrates “Import Tax/Import” values for Portugal for the period 1836-1990.
Russia: Customs revenue to the central government of the Soviet Union and total imports from all
international borders, 1924-28, are taken from the Statisticheskii Spravochnik SSSR 1928 (USSR
Statistical Handbook 1928), Soiuz SSR TSentral'noe Statisticheskoe Upravlenie (USSR Central Statistical
Agency), Moscow, 1929, pp 570, 713.
Yugoslavia (Serbia): Tariff figures are taken from W. S. Woytinsky and E. S. Woytinsky, World
Commerce and Governments - Trends and Outlook (New York: The Twentieth Century Fund, 1955), p.
277, for benchmark years between 1913-1931. However, it has been noted that the average tariff levels in
this source most likely refer to import-duties-over-dutiable-imports ratios, and thus are consistently higher
than what other sources suggest. Therefore, Yugoslav tariff rates given in Woytinsky and Woytinksy
(1955) have been altered: the benchmark values were converted to import-duties-over-total-imports
estimates. The sum of tariff levels for Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden given in
Woytinksy and Woytinsky (1955) in each benchmark year was divided by the sum of tariff levels for the
same countries and years found in other sources (cited in this Data Appendix for each of the countries).
Then, the Yugoslav tariff rates reported in Woytinksy and Woytinsky (1955) were divided by this ratio, in
order to estimate Yugoslav import-duties-over-total-imports. Missing years have been geometrically
interpolated. Also, it has been noted that the Serbian tariff level estimates used in Clemens and Williamson
(2000) also refer to import-duties-over-dutiable-imports. Therefore, the Clemens and Williamson Serbian
tariff figures for 1865-1913 were linked to the tariff levels calculated above for 1913-1931, yielding an
estimate for Serbian import-duties-over-total-imports ratios for 1865-1913.
Spain: Figures for 1865-1940 come from two sources: imports are taken from L. Prados de la
Escosura, El Progreso economico de Espana, 1850-2000 (Madrid: 2002), while “tariff revenue” is taken
from F. Comin, Fuentes cuantitativas para el estudio del sector publico en Espana. (Madrid: 1985).
Sweden: Average tariff figures for 1865-1910 are from Mitchell (1992). Figures for 1911-1940 are

A-6

taken from Handel (Stockholm: Sveriges Officiella Statistik, various issues), where customs duties as a
percentage of imports (“Tulluppbörd i % av införseln”) are given in various issues (1917: p. 34, 1926: p.
28, 1936: p. 32, 1945: p. 37, 1951: p. 34).
Thailand: Figures for 1914-1940 are taken from Constance M. Wilson, Thailand: A Handbook of
Historical Statistics, (Boston: G.K. Hall & Co., 1983), pp. 210-1 (imports) and pp. 242-4 (customs duties).
Turkey: Figures for 1923-1940 come from the Annuaire Statistique (Ankara: Republique Turque,
Office Central De Statistique, various issues), which report imports (1928: pp. 103-6, 1932-1933: p. 250,
1938-1939: p. 231, 1948: p. 396, 1951: p. 357) and import taxes (“taxes douanieres,” i.e. “gümrük resmi,”
1928: pp. 156-7, 1930: p. 310, 1932-1933: p. 302, 1938-1939: pp. 276-7, 1942-1945: p. 385, 1948: p.
434, 1950: p. 245, 1951: p. 324).
United Kingdom: Figures for 1865-1940 are taken from Brian R. Mitchell, British Historical
Statistics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), where imports (p. 453) and customs revenue
(pp. 582-4) are reported annually.
United States: Figures for 1865-1940 come from Woytinsky and Woytinsky (1955), pp. 263-4.
The reported data are “duties as percentage of total imports” (emphasis added). Thus, the Woytinsky and
Woytinsky US series does not have the upward bias mentioned previously for the case of Yugoslavia.
Some missing years falling in the period 1865-1910 are geometrically interpolated.
Uruguay: Figures for 1913-1940 are taken from Anuario Estadistico (Montevideo: Ministerio de
Hacienda, Direccion General de Estadistica y Censos, various issues), where import duties (“derechos de
aduana s. importacion”) and imports are reported annually. Tariff figures for two missing years, 1923 and
1939, are estimated by geometric interpolation.

Population
For the entire period under observation, annual estimates of the population (in thousands) of
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Cuba, Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United
Kingdom, Uruguay, USA, and Yugoslavia are given in Banks (1976). Missing war years 1914-1918 are
derived by geometric interpolation.
Population for Ceylon (Sri Lanka) is taken from Mitchell (1998), while that for Burma, Egypt,
India, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, and Thailand are taken from Maddison (1995).
Population for Australia before 1901, Cuba before 1902, Germany before 1867, New Zealand
before 1907, and Serbia before 1878 are not reported in Banks (1976). For these, the population figures in

A-7

Clemens and Williamson (2000) are used, linked to the Banks figures. For Ceylon and India, the figures
used in Clemens and Williamson for 1865-1913 are linked to the post-1914 series.

GDP and GDP per Capita
For most countries, gross domestic product per capita (in 1990 US dollars) is taken from Angus
Maddison, Monitoring the World Economy 1820-1992 (Paris: Development Center of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, 1995). Missing years are geometrically interpolated.
For five countries not reported in Maddison (1995)—Ceylon, Cuba, Egypt, Portugal and Uruguay,
GDP per capita is calculated by dividing a country’s income (in 1990 US dollars) by population in every
year. Sources of the population data have been described above, and the sources of the income estimates
follow.
GDP per capita for Ceylon in 1914 is benchmarked relative to India’s in 1914 by the ratio (1.95)
given in Burnham O. Campbell, “Development Trends: A Comparative Analysis of the Asian Experience,”
in Naohiro Ogawa et al., eds., Human Resources in Development Along the Asia-Pacific Rim (New York:
Oxford University Press, 1993). The same ratio had declined to 1.52 by 1948 according to United Nations
Statistical Yearbook 1949-50 (New York: 1950), pp. 21-2 and 406. In the intervening years, it is assumed
that this ratio declined annually at a constant rate.
Cuba’s Net National Product in current year pesos comes from Mitchell (1993). These NNP values
are converted to 1990 US dollars with the help of the peso-dollar exchange rate given in Taylor (2000) and
the American historical consumer price index given in John McCusker, How Much Is That in Real Money
(Worcester, Mass.: American Antiquarian Society, 1992), pp. 330-2.
A trend for Egyptian GDP per capita is calculated with the help of benchmark values given in
Maddison (1995). Annual GDP per capita estimates are then calculated under the assumption that Egypt
deviated from the Maddison-estimated Egyptian benchmark trend in the same way (percentage-wise) as
Turkey did from her GDP per capita trend (after the civil war).
Figures for Portugal come from das Neves (1994). The GDP figures given in both current and
1914 constant escudos are converted to 1990 US dollars using the escudo-dollar exchange rate given in
Taylor (2000) and the American historical price index in McCusker (1992).
GDP for Uruguay is taken from Mitchell (1993) for the period 1935-1940. Annual GDP per capita
estimates for 1914-1934 are calculated by assuming that Uruguay deviated from her GDP per capita trend
(between the benchmark years of 1914, found in Clemens and Williamson (2000), and 1935, found in
Mitchell) in the same way that Argentina did.

A-8

Share of Primary Product Exports in Total Exports
This variable denotes the fraction of total export values consisting of “primary products” (defined
below). Viewed as an indicator of the relative endowment of natural resources, it was made popular by
Jeffrey Sachs and Andrew Warner, “Natural Resource Abundance and Economic Growth,” NBER
Working Paper 5398, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Mass. (December 1995). They
defined “primary products” as those commodities falling into categories 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 68 of the United
Nations Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) Revision 1. These categories are, respectively:
food and live animals, beverages and tobacco, crude materials excluding fuels, mineral fuels, animal or
vegetable oils and fats, and non-ferrous metals. We use a slightly different definition of primary products,
namely categories I, II, and III, of the Brussels 1913 Commodity Classification (recorded in Conference
Internationale de Statistique Commerciale, Bruxelles, 1913: Documents et Proces-Verbaux,
Establissements Generaux D’Imprimerie, Brussels, 1914). These categories are, respectively: live animals,
food and drink, and raw materials or simply-prepared products. Thus, our definition of primary products
includes all exports except categories IV (manufactured products) and V (money and specie). The only
substantive differences between our definition of primary products and that of Sachs-Warner are that the
former includes iron ore and excludes manufactured tobacco products like cigarettes and cigars.
Figures for the United States, Germany, France, Russia, Australia, Austria, Canada, Italy, Japan,
Spain, Sweden, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and India come from the League of Nations,
Industrialization and Foreign Trade (Geneva: Economic, Financial, and Transit Authority, 1945), pp. 15467.
The sources of the figures for the remaining countries are the following: Argentina, Direccion
General de Estadistica de la Nacion, El Comercio Exterior Argentino (Buenos Aires: various issues), 1925:
pp. 26-30 and 1936: pp. 61-70; Brazil, Ministerio da Fazenda, Comercio Exterior do Brasil (Rio de

Danmarks Statistik, Department of Statistics, 1926 and 1936), 1925: p. 8, 1935: p. 8; for Egypt and
Indonesia, figures are obtained through geometrical interpolation between the benchmark value in 1914,
given in Clemens and Williamson (2000), and the benchmark value in 1954, found in the United Nations
Yearbook of International Trade Statistics 1955 (Statistical Office of the United Nations, Department of
Economic and Social Affairs, New York, 1956). Interpolation over such a long period of time seems
justified because for both countries in question, the figures for 1914 and 1954 are very similar; Greece, M.
Dorizas, The Foreign Trade of Greece (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania PhD thesis, 1925),
Appendix 2; Mexico, Anuario de 1930 (Mexico D. F.: Departamento de Estadistica Nacional, Tacubaya,
1932), p. 442 and Secretaria de la Economia Nacional, Anuario Estadistico de los Estados Unidos
Mexicanos 1939 (Mexico D. F.: 1941), p. 578; Norway, figures are estimated using the following sources:
Values of export of manufactured and primary products in 1913 are found in Norway Foreign Trade
(Oslo: The Trade Intelligence Bureau of Norway, 1923), p. 11. An index of the exports of manufactures in
1913-1930 is given in Norwegian Trade Review (Oslo: A.S Norwegian Publications), March 1931, vol. 2,
no. 3, p. 68. These two sources are combined to estimate the value of primary product exports. Primary
product exports are then divided by the value of total exports, reported in Banks (1976); Peru, Ministerio
de Hacienda y Comercio, Comercio Especial del Peru (Callao: Estadistica General de Aduanas, 1926), p.
XXIV) and Anuario del Comercio Exterior del Peru (Callao: Departamento de Estadistica General de
Aduanas, 1936), unnumbered page; Portugal, Ministerio das Financas, Anuario Estatistico de Portugal

For every country, missing values are estimated by geometric interpolation between the primary

A-10

product export fractions at benchmark years.

Export Share
Export Share is calculated as the ratio of exports to national income. GDP is used in the
denominator, and its sources can be found above. Data for exports (in current US dollar equivalents) come
from Banks (1976), except for Burma, Ceylon, Egypt, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Portugal, and
Uruguay. The export figures given in Banks in current US dollars are converted to 1990 US dollars using
the American historical consumer price index in McCusker (1992). Export data for the years 1914-1918
are obtained by geometric interpolation. Dividing these interpolated export figures by GDP gives the
openness ratios for the war-time years.
Export figures for Ceylon, Egypt, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines are found in Mitchell
(1998). The export figures given in current national currency units in Mitchell are converted to 1990 US
dollars using the exchange rates in Taylor (2000) and the American historical consumer price index in
McCusker (1992). Once converted to 1990 US dollars, the export data for India, Indonesia, and the
Philippines are divided by Maddison’s (1995) GDP estimates to get the openness variable. The calculation
of Ceylon, Egypt, and Uruguay’s per capita GDP has already been described. Per capita GDP figures for
these three countries were multiplied by their population estimates to get GDP. Exports were then divided
by these GDP levels to get the openness ratio of Ceylon, Egypt, and Uruguay.
To calculate openness for Burma, we rely on Saito and Kiong (1999), who provide estimates of
Burmese Net Domestic Product and exports in current rupees until 1938. For Portugal, export and GDP
figures in current escudos are taken from das Neves (1994).

Effective Distance from Trading Partners
Effectuve Distance from trading partners is calculated as the product of two quantities. The first
quantity is the average distance from the capital city of the country in question to the capital cities of its
principal trading partners, weighted by the value of exports going to each of those partners in the year in
question. Distances are taken from the Microsoft Excel Worksheet prepared by Howard Shatz’s
unpublished data (Cambridge: Harvard University Center for International Development, 1997), which
gives them in miles between 254 (mainly capital) cities of the world using the great circle formula. The
second quantity is an index of tramp shipping freight charges (per distance and weight) shown in Table
VIII (p. 122) of L. Isserlis, “Tramp Shipping Cargoes, and Freights,” Journal of the Royal Statistical
Society, 101, 1 (1938): pp. 53-146. Distance from the closest world export center is multiplied by this

A-11

shipping freight index. Note that the Isserlis index only offers an estimate of changes in global
transportation costs which is generic to the world as a whole. By using it, we only control for differences in
transportation costs over time, not across space. The later are not yet available on the comprehensive scale
that this data set demands.

Energy Consumption per Capita
As is common in historical studies with limited endowment data, energy consumption per capita is
used as a proxy for capital-labor ratios. For most countries, energy consumption in kilograms of coal
equivalent per capita from the year 1919 onwards is taken from Banks (1976).
Data for Burma, Ceylon, China, India, Indonesia, and Philippines come from the United Nations,
World Energy Supplies in Selected Years, 1929-1950 (New York: Statistical Papers, Series J, no. 1, 1952),
pp. 64-6, where per capita consumption of commercial uses of energy is reported in metric tons for
benchmark years between 1929-1950. Figures for missing years between the benchmark values are
obtained by geometric interpolation. Figures for 1914-1928 for these six countries only are estimated as a
linear function of population, GDP per capita, openness, population growth, primary product exports as a
fraction of total exports, primary school enrollment as a fraction of population below age 14, land area, and
railroad mileage per capita. The prediction function is calibrated for each country using known energy
consumption during 1929-1950, when it performs extremely well, and is assumed valid for 1914-1928 as
well. The same prediction function was applied to Egypt in the absence of calibrating data, there being
little reason to believe that Egyptian energy usage patterns during this period were radically different from
peer countries.

Infant Mortality
Infant mortality denotes the number of deaths of infants under one year old per 1000 live births,
and they are taken from the appropriate edition of Mitchell’s International Historical Statistics (1992,
1993, 1998) for every country except six—Brazil, Burma, China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Turkey. Figures
are collected for the entire period of 1865-1940, but for some countries data are not available all the way
back to 1865. For the period 1921-1938, figures for Burma, Thailand, and Turkey come from the League
of Nations, Statistical Year-Book of the League of Nations (Geneva: League of Nations Economic
Intelligence Service, 1941). In case of Thailand, 1921-1935 data for the "straits settlements" (comprising
roughly modern-day Malaysia) are used as a proxy; after 1936 unproxied Thai figures come from Wilson
(1983), p. 46. For Turkey, the average of Greece, Yugoslavia and Egypt is used for benchmarks, and for

A-12

the missing Turkish years in between those benchmarks, the trend for Egypt is assumed.
Figures for Brazil are taken from Ludwig (1985), p. 84. The unweighted average of the infant
mortality rates of several urban counties is used to estimate Brazil’s overall infant mortality rate.
Infant mortality rates for Peru come from Mitchell (1993) from 1940 onwards only. Before 1940,
Peru is assumed to follow Colombia’s trend.
Figures for China are estimated by India’s infant mortality rates, while the infant mortality rates of
the Philippines are used as a proxy for Indonesia.

Inflation
Inflation is calculated as the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of each
country. The annual change in the CPI for most countries is given in Taylor (2000). Inflation figures are
collected for the period 1865-1940. However, figures in Taylor’s database do not reach back all the way to
1865 for every country.
Figures for Burma are estimated by using the Burmese cost of living index in the United Nations
Statistical Yearbook 1949-50 (New York, 1950) p. 402 and the Indian CPI given in Taylor (2000).
Figures for the Philippines are estimated using the cost of living index given in the United Nations
Statistical Yearbook 1949-50 (New York, 1950), p. 403 and the Yearbook of Philippine Statistics
(Manila: Bureau of the Census and Statistics, Republic of the Philippines, 1947), p. 251; augmented by the
cost of living trends for China, India, and Japan reported in the United Nations Statistical Yearbook 194950, and by the retail and wholesale price trends for China, India, Indonesia, and Japan in the Statistical
Year-Book of the League of Nations (Geneva: various issues), 1931/32: pp. 312-21 and 1938/39: pp. 2316.
Cuban inflation is estimated using the following pieces of evidence: the index of the cost of food
in Cuba given in the Anuario Estadistico de Cuba de 1952 (Havana: Ministerio de Hacienda, Republica de
Cuba), p 285; the Cuban cost of living index from the United Nations Statistical Yearbook 1949-50, p.
401; and annual changes in the CPIs of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru taken from
Taylor (2000).
Inflation for Ceylon are estimated using the export and import price indices, the terms of trade
index, and the working class cost of living index for Ceylon given in Thirty Years Trade Statistics of
Ceylon (1925-1954) , Part IV (Colombo: Government Press, 1957), p.1901.
Inflation for Thailand is calculated as the annual percentage change in the wholesale food price
index, taken from Wilson (1983), p. 322.

A-13

Inflation for Indonesia is calculated from the Consumer Price Index given in Mitchell (1993).
Inflation for Portugal is estimated with the annual change of the GDP deflator given in das Neves
(1994), pp. 193-7.
For Colombia, figures for 1917-1924 come from Mitchell (1993), while figures for the rest of the
period are taken from Taylor (2000).

Land-Labor Ratio
The land-labor ratio is calculated by dividing total area of arable (food) crops in hectares by labor
force.
Estimates for the sixteen countries consisting of Argentina, Australia, Canada, Uruguay, USA,
UK, Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, Spain, Egypt, Thailand, India, Burma, and Japan are taken from
the database underlying the analysis in J. G. Williamson, “Land, Labor and Globalization in the PreIndustrial Third World, NBER Working Paper 7784, National Bureau of Economics Research, Cambridge,
Mass. (July 2000) where they are described in an appendix. The method, however, is the same as that
described below for the remaining 19 countries.
Estimates for the nineteen countries consisting of Austria, Brazil, Ceylon, Chile, China, Colombia,
Cuba, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Turkey,
USSR, and Yugoslavia were calculated in the following way: Total area of arable crops (in hectares) are
taken from the appropriate edition of Mitchell’s International Historical Statistics (1992, 1993, 1998). The
labor force is estimated by the population between the ages 15 and 64. The fraction of the population
between ages 15 and 64 are calculated from Mitchell (1992, 1993, 1998), but provided for census years
only. The fraction 15-64 was then multiplied by the total population in the census years to get benchmark
estimates of the each country’s labor force, and thus the land-labor ratio. Land-labor ratios for the missing
years between the benchmarks are estimated by geometric interpolation.

School Enrollment Rate
Two variables are used to measure the primary school enrollment rates for those of school age.
The first variable is primary school enrollment per capita. The second is the population share under the age
of 14. Each variable is described in turn.
Per capita primary school enrollment rates for most countries are taken from Banks (1976), and
war-time years (1914-1918) are geometrically interpolated.
Primary school enrollment for Burma, Ceylon, Egypt, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines are

A-14

from Mitchell (1998). These figures are then divided by the size of the population of each country, in order
to arrive at per capita school enrollment. Figures for Ceylon denote primary and secondary school
enrollment per capita combined. (It is assumed that secondary enrollment is a tiny fraction of total school
enrollment in Ceylon.)
Primary school enrollment figures for Australia are from Peter H. Lindert, "Democracy,
Decentralization, and Mass Schooling Before 1914: Appendices," Working Paper 105, Agricultural
History Center, University of California at Davis (2001), pp. 11-12. Missing years are geometrically
interpolated.
Primary school enrollment rates for those of school age are calculated by dividing per capita
primary enrollment rates by the fraction of the population under the age of 14. The fraction of the
population under the age of 14 is calculated from the appropriate editions of Mitchell (1992, 1993, 1998),
where the population distributions by age are provided for census years. The youth dependency ratios (i.e.
fraction of the population under the age of 14) for missing years are obtained by geometric interpolation.

Railroad Mileage
Railroad mileage, defined as miles of line (public and private) rather than miles of track, is taken
from Banks (1976), and war-time years (1914-1918) are geometrically interpolated.

Land Area
Land area, excluding non-contiguous colonies, and in thousands of square miles, is taken from
Banks (1976). Where a country’s borders were changed during World War I, we assume that the change
took place in 1919. In the case of Australia, Burma, Ceylon, Cuba, Egypt, India, Indonesia, New Zealand,
Philippines, and Serbia, where Banks (1976) does not report land area for the beginning of our observed
period, land area is assumed to be unchanged going back to 1865.

Terms of Trade
Terms of trade figures for 1870-1940 for Argentina, Australia, Burma, Canada, Denmark, Egypt,
France, Germany, India, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United Kingdom, Uruguay, and USA are taken
from the database underlying Williamson (2000). However, these figures were converted from the base
year 1911, to 1900.
For countries not covered in Williamson, terms of trade figures for 1865-1914 are taken from
Clemens and Williamson (2000). Missing years for Argentina, Burma, Germany, and Sweden are filled in

A-15

from Clemens and Williamson as well.

Exports to Main Trading Partners
This variable denotes the value of exports (in current national currency units) to a country’s main
trading partners. Figures for every country are presented in the appropriate editions of Mitchell (1992,
1993, 1998).

Trading partner tariffs and growth
The index of tariffs in principal trading partners is calculated as the weighted average of own
tariffs in the four or five countries to which the country in question exported the largest absolute value of
goods (for three countries—Colombia, New Zealand, and the Philippines—only the top three trading
partners are covered). The weights are the absolute value of exports that went to each of said partners.
These partner export figures are taken from Mitchell op. cit. In all cases, the vast majority of each
country’s exports are accounted for by exports to these principal trading partners. The index of growth in
principal trading partners is calculated in identical fashion.

PART II: AFTER 1950

Import Duties over Imports
After 1970, these are taken from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators 2000 CDROM. Prior to 1970 and in cases of missing numbers for 1970-75 in the World Bank data, they are taken
from the United Nations Statistical Yearbook, "Public Finance" and "External Trade" sections, 1951,
1957, 1963, 1967, 1973, and 1977, Statistical Office of the United Nations, Dept. of Economic and Social
Affairs, New York. In all cases the United Nations data are collected until a sufficiently late year as to
provide significant overlap with the World Bank numbers, to ensure that the two series matched up well at
the interface. Since European Union tariffs are collected by a central authority, customs revenue to
national governments trends quickly towards zero when countries join the EU. For this reason, the ratio of
import duties to imports for the entire EU is applied to each member country starting from the year it
joined the Union.

Effective Distance
Physical distance comes from Shatz op. cit., and is multiplied by an index of transportation costs

A-16

to calculate “effective distance” exactly as described in the pre-1950 section. The index of
transportation costs is calculated using data provided by David Hummels which are described in David
Hummels 1999, "Have International Transportation Costs Declined?" Mimeo, University of Chicago (as
of this writing he has relocated to Purdue University). A worldwide index of transportation costs is
constructed as a weighted average of Hummels’ air and ocean shipping cost indices, weighted by the
fraction of world trade going by each mode of transportation in each year.
Openness
The OPEN variable described in Jeffrey Sachs and Andrew Warner, 1995, “Economic Reform and
the Process of Global Integration,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 1:1-118 is available on the
website of Harvard University’s Center for International Development,
http://www.cid.harvard.edu/ciddata/ciddata.html. The other regressors used by Sachs and Warner have
been posted by Robert Barro and Jong-Wha Lee on the website of the National Bureau of Economic
Research, http://www.nber.org/pub/barro.lee.
Trading Partners
Exports from every country in the world to every other country in the world, 1950-1997, are taken
from the Direction of Trade database published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF, Direction of
Trade Statistics, 1948-1997, [Computer File], ICPSR ed. (Ann Arbor, Michigan: Inter-University
Consortium for Political and Social Research, 1998)). These export values, for each country in each year,
are used as weights when calculating the average OPENness of trading partners, average effective distance
to trading partners, average GDP growth among trading partners, and average trading partner tariffs.
Other regressors
Population, natural population growth and immigration figures are taken from the United Nations
Demographic Yearbook, Historical Supplement 2000 on CD-ROM. Primary school enrollment, the
fraction of the population below age 15, and the dependency ratio (the ratio of the population aged below
15 or above 64 to the population between the ages of 15 and 64) are taken from World Bank’s World
Development Indicators CD-ROM 2000. Real GDP per capita, real exchange rates and Terms of Trade
are taken from the International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics CD-ROM 2000. Also
used (see footnote 16) were the real GDP per capita figures of Summers and Heston (Penn World Tables
v5.6, 2000, Center for International Comparisons, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. Available at
http://pwt.econ.upenn.edu).
