WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE (AND COUNTRIES) MORE PROTECTIONIST THAN OTHERS?
Anna Maria Mayda and Dani Rodrik

I. Introduction
Economists disagree intensely on many public policy issues. What is the best way to deal
with poverty? What is the appropriate role of the government in providing health insurance?
Should Microsoft be broken up? Does counter-cyclical macroeconomic policy make sense?
Should social security be privatized? Should we tax international capital flows? Is the minimum
wage desirable? In these and many other areas, economists are engaged in lively controversies
that reflect broader public debates on social problems.
International trade poses an interesting contrast. Here the debates remain largely
technical, even among policy-oriented economists: which theory is more appropriate in
explaining the patterns of trade? How much, if at all, has trade contributed to the rise in the skill
premium in the U.S.? Why are "border effects" so large? On the important policy questions that
excite the public, there is virtually no difference of views. The consensus among mainstream
economists on the desirability of free trade remains almost universal.
It is striking how little this consensus resonates with public opinion. When asked about
their views on trade, typically sixty percent or more of respondents in opinion polls express antitrade views. While there are some interesting differences across countries, which we shall
document and analyze later, a majority of respondents tend to be in favor of restricting trade
regardless of national context.
Our purpose in this paper is to shed light on this phenomenon, by undertaking a
systematic analysis of individual preferences on trade and their underlying determinants. We
make use of an interesting cross-country data set put together by the International Social Survey

2
Programme (ISSP), which allows us to perform a comparative analysis covering more than
20,000 individuals in 23 countries. As our title indicates, we are interested in uncovering the
determinants of individual preferences on trade. We use as our dependent variable a question in
the ISSP data set that asks whether the respondent favors restricting trade. The data set also
contains a wealth of information on demographics, socio-economic status, and values, which we
use to test a number of hypotheses about the formation of preferences.
The standard workhorse models of international trade have well-defined implications for
the distributive consequences of trade and hence for individual preferences (see Rodrik 1995 for
a review of the literature). Under the factor-endowments model, which assumes costless intersectoral mobility of productive factors, trade benefits individuals who own the factors with
which the economy is relatively well endowed, and hurts the others. This is the well-known
Stolper-Samuelson theorem. Under the specific-factors model, trade benefits individuals who
are employed in the export-oriented sectors and hurts those who are employed in the importcompeting sectors. To the extent that individuals are motivated by material self-interest, these
models provide important hints about an individual's likely attitude to trade depending on his/her
factor type or sector of employment.
Our first set of results relates directly to these economic models. Most strikingly, and
somewhat contrary to our own priors, we find strong support for the factor-endowments view of
the world. Individuals with higher levels of human capital (proxied by educational attainment)
oppose trade restrictions, but only in countries that are well endowed with human capital.
Higher levels of education are associated with pro-trade views in advanced countries such as
Germany and the United States, but with anti-trade views in the Philippines (the poorest country
in our sample). Most of the other countries are intermediate between these two extremes. That

3
individual trade preferences interact with country characteristics in exactly the manner predicted
by the factor-endowments model may be considered surprising, but it is a robust result and
perhaps our strongest single finding.
We find some support for the sector-specific factors model as well. In particular,
individuals employed in import-competing industries are more likely to be in favor of trade
restrictions (compared to individuals in non-traded sectors). However, individuals in exportoriented sectors are not significantly less predisposed to trade restrictions (compared again to
individuals in non-traded sectors). This finding can be rationalized within the sector specific
model by appealing to the presence of intra-industry (two-way) trade: individuals in exportoriented sectors still feel the pressure of imports and thus their attitudes to trade are intermediate:
they do not favor trade as much as individuals in non-traded sectors, but neither are they as
protectionist as individuals in import-competing sectors.
The fact that the factor-endowments and sector-specific models both find support in the
data suggests that individuals may differ in their perceptions of inter-sectoral mobility. Some
view themselves as mobile over the relevant time horizon (and express preferences in line with
the factor-endowments model), while others view themselves as immobile (and express
preferences in line with the sector-specific factors model). We find evidence that is loosely
consistent with this reading when we use the (imperfect) measure of mobility that is contained in
our dataset.
While the implications of conventional economic models are borne out by the data, these
models go only part of the way in explaining the formation of preferences. We find that social
status, relative incomes, values, and attachments play, if anything, a more important role. In
particular, one of our key findings is that attitudes toward trade are closely linked to an

4
individual's relative standing on the domestic income scale. Individuals with incomes greater
than the national average tend to favor trade while those with below-average incomes favor
protection. Interestingly, it is income relative to the national average, rather than the absolute
level of income, that is correlated with trade preferences. Subjective evaluations of social status
bear a similar relationship to trade preferences: individuals who consider themselves part of the
upper classes tend to be more favorable to trade than those who consider themselves to be from
the lower classes. These findings are suggestive of a link between income distribution and trade
preferences that is independent of factor ownership and sector of employment.
Our final set of results relates to self-expressed values, identities, and attachments.
Protectionist attitudes go together with a well-defined set of normative attributes. Individuals
who favor trade restrictions tend to have high attachments to their neighborhood and community,
have a high degree of national pride, and believe that national interest should be paramount in
making trade-offs. At the same time, individuals who have confidence in their country's
democracy and economic achievements are less likely to favor trade protection. Therefore, the
picture that emerges is this: communitarian-patriotic values tend to foster protectionist attitudes,
but this tendency is moderated when the broader institutions of society are perceived to be
working well.
The bottom line is that both economic and non-economic considerations are important in
determining attitudes towards trade. Once we take the myriad factors discussed above into
account, we are reasonably successful in explaining the variation in trade preferences in our
sample. Our preferred "combined" model accounts for about a fifth of the sample variance.
Moreover, we are also reasonably successful in explaining the differences in mean preferences

5
across countries. Our preferred model does a good job of explaining why respondents in Poland,
for example, are more protectionist on average than those in Germany.
The empirical literature on the political economy of trade policy is not small, but it has
focused largely on testing the implications of the factor-endowments and sector-specific factors
models. Thus, studies that have found support for the factor-endowments model include
Rogowski (1987, 1989), Midford (1993), Beaulieu (1996) Balistreri (1997), and Scheve and
Slaughter (1998, 2001). Studies that have found support for the sector-specific model include
Magee (1978) and Irwin (1994, 1996). Some have found support for both views of the world
(Baldwin and Magee 1998 and Beaulieu and Magee 2001). With the exception of Balistreri
(1997) and Scheve and Slaughter (1998), none of these studies analyze individual preferences
directly. Instead they infer preferences from aggregated information on voting, campaigncontributions, or policy outcomes.1 Also, no study to date has analyzed these issues in a crossnational framework.
Since we began our work with the ISSP data set we have become aware of two other
related, but independent papers: O'Rourke and Sinnott (2001) and Beaulieu, Benarroch, and
Gaisford (2001). Both of these papers use the ISSP survey to explore the determinants of trade
preferences. The O'Rourke and Sinnott paper is closest to ours, and many of its conclusions
parallel our own findings. We find this reassuring since some of the methodological choices we
have made quite naturally differ.2 Beaulieu et al. (2001) focus more narrowly on testing the
Stolper-Samuelson theorem. Their conclusions on Stolper-Samuelson are at variance with ours:

1

For example, Irwin (1994, 1996) looks at the outcomes of the 1906 and 1923 British general elections and
interprets them as proxies for voters’ preferences on new trade barriers.
2

Some of the key differences are as follows: O'Rourke and Sinnott (2001) measure human capital differently, use
ordered probit (we use ordered logit), do not test the sector-specific model, and do not focus on relative-income or
status.

6
we (along with O'Rourke and Sinnott 2001) find strong support, while they do not, for reasons
we shall discuss briefly later on.
The plan of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we briefly describe the data and
the methods we have used. Next, we present a series of empirical models highlighting different
types of determinants of trade preferences. In the penultimate section, we put all our results
together and comment on the overall fit of our explanatory framework. A final section
concludes.

II. Description of the data and empirical approach
The International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) collects cross-national data by
combining national surveys on topics that are important for social science research
(http://www.issp.org/). In this paper we use data from the 1995 ISSP National Identity module
(ISSP-NI). The data set covers information at the individual level on some 28,456 respondents
from 23 countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan, many Western and Eastern
European countries, and one developing country (the Philippines).3 For each individual, the data
set contains responses on a variety of topics, ranging from opinions on trade and immigration
policy to feelings of patriotism and regional attachment. In addition, the ISSP-NI data set
contains information on several economic and demographic variables. Thus the survey allows us
to identify both stated trade policy preferences and individual characteristics that explain
attitudes towards trade in standard economic models. Since not all questions are covered in
individual country surveys, our regressions will typically not include all 23 countries.

3

The full list of countries covered in the data set comprises West Germany, East Germany, Great Britain, United
States, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Poland, Bulgaria,
Russia, New Zealand, Canada, Philippines, Japan, Spain, Latvia, and Slovak Republic.

7
In order to measure individual trade policy preferences, we focus on survey answers to
the following question:
Now we would like to ask a few questions about relations between (respondent's country)
and other countries. How much do you agree or disagree with the following statements:
(Respondent's country) should limit the import of foreign products in order to protect its
national economy.
1. Agree strongly
2. Agree
3. Neither agree nor disagree
4. Disagree
5. Disagree strongly
8. Can't choose, don't know
9. NA, refused
After deleting the “Can’t choose, don’t know” and “NA, refused” responses, we transformed
survey questions into the dependent variable TRADE_OP (with answers ranging from 1=agree
strongly to 5=disagree strongly). Higher values of TRADE_OP therefore correspond to
preferences that are more pro-trade and less protectionist. TRADE_OP is our preferred
dependent variable, and we use it in most of our empirical exercises.
We also created two binary variables, which we label TRADEPRO and TRADECON.
TRADEPRO is set equal to unity for individuals opposing trade protection (i.e. for those
replying “disagree” or “disagree strongly” to the question), and to zero for the rest.
TRADECON is set equal to unity for individuals favoring trade protection (i.e. for those replying
“agree” or “agree strongly” to the question), and to zero for others. We ran probit regressions
with TRADEPRO and TRADECON. Since the results were virtually indistinguishable from
those with the ordered logits using TRADE_OP, we shall not report them here.
Table 1 presents summary statistics for TRADE_OP, TRADEPRO and TRADECON, by
country. Several results stand out. First, as in previous analyses, protectionist sentiment runs

8
high on average. Taking the 23 countries as a whole, more than half of the respondents agree
with the proposition that trade should be restricted (average TRADECON = 0.58), while fewer
than a quarter disagree (average TRADEPRO = 0.23). Second, there is quite a large variation in
trade preferences across countries. Netherlands emerges as the country that is the most pro-trade
(TRADEPRO = 0.40) while Bulgaria is the most protectionist (TRADEPRO = 0.09), regardless
of the indicator used. Third, as the last comment indicates, the rankings of the countries are not
very sensitive to the measure of trade preferences. Generally, the continental European countries
tend to be the most free trade oriented, while the former socialist economies of Europe are the
most protectionist. The United States is intermediate between these two groups.
Are these findings truly reflective of underlying attitudes towards trade? It is well known
that survey responses tend to be highly sensitive to framing--the phrasing of the question and the
context and order in which it is asked. In this particular case, there is especially cause to worry
because the question in ISSP-NI refers to possible benefits of restricting imports ("protecting
national economy") without mentioning any drawbacks. One would suspect that this imparts a
strong protectionist bias to the responses. There are two countervailing considerations. First,
there is ample evidence from the U.S., which suggests that the precise phrasing of the question
on imports does not greatly affect the average responses provided (see the review in Scheve and
Slaughter 2001). Second, in our empirical work, we will be interested in identifying the
determinants of the differences in attitudes across individuals. Even though the responses on
trade may be biased in one direction, our results will not be affected unless the magnitude of the
bias is also correlated with our explanatory variables.
We might also wonder whether protectionist sentiment, as captured by surveys of this
kind, has any relationship to actual trade policies. There are of course good reasons to believe

9
that in any political system there would be considerable slippage between individual preferences
on any specific issue and policy outcomes. The "supply" side of policy can be as important as
the "demand" side. Moreover, the institutional structures of government and of political
representation mediate between individual voters and policy makers. This is shown
schematically in Figure 1 (taken from Rodrik 1995). Nonetheless, it is interesting to know
whether trade preferences broadly correlate with trade policies in our sample.
Figure 2 shows that the answer is broadly yes. The correlation between average values of
TRADE_OP and average level of trade duties across countries is negative and statistically
significant (robust t-statistic = -2.13, significant at 5% level).4 The point estimate suggests that a
one-point increase in TRADE_OP on our 5-point scale is accompanied with a 3.6 percentage
point reduction in average duties. At the same time, it is clear from the figure that the
relationship is quite a loose one: TRADE_OP accounts for no more than 8 percent of the crosscountry variation in average tariffs.
In the following, we shall use TRADE_OP as our dependent variable and estimate a
series of ordered logit models. Ordered logit is our preferred specification because it preserves
the maximum amount of the information in the dependent variable without imposing linearity on
the underlying relationship between the explanatory variables and the 5-point scale on which
TRADE_OP is calibrated.5 Appendix I provides more information on the technical aspects of
the ordered logit. We have checked the robustness of our results to alternative specifications,

4

Trade duties refer to combined import and export duties (tm and tx, respectively) over the 1992-98 period,
calculated as [(1+ tm)*(1+tx)] -1. The source for duties is the World Development Indicators CD-Rom of the World
Bank. Two countries, Slovenia and Slovak Republic, are not included in Figure 1 because the World Bank does not
provide data on duties for them.
5

An alternative would have been to estimate ordered probit models, as is done in O'Rourke and Sinnott (2001). The
ordered logit assumes that the error term in the underlying latent relationship is distributed logistically, while the
ordered probit assumes it is distributed normally.

10
running probit regressions with TRADEPRO and TRADECON as well as OLS regressions with
TRADE_OP. We find very few substantive differences so we shall not present the results from
these different specifications. In most of our specifications, we will include a full set of country
dummies to minimize the likelihood of picking up spurious correlations between regressors and
TRADE_OP. With few exceptions, the inclusion of country fixed effects did not affect the
results either.
One shortcoming of the ordered logit is that the coefficient estimates are hard to interpret.
As explained in the appendix, even the sign of an estimated coefficient has to be interpreted
cautiously: it provides an unambiguous signal with respect to the marginal probabilities of only
the top and bottom categories (or groups of categories) on the 5-point scale of our dependent
variable. Rather than cluttering the tables with estimated coefficients, therefore, we will report
two measures for each regressor that indicate the estimated increase in the probability of each of
the highest two categories ("disagree" and "disagree strongly" with trade restrictions) given a
marginal increase in the value of the relevant regressor, holding all other regressors at their mean
value. We will often refer to the sum of the two marginal effects presented in the tables, since
this sum represents the estimated impact that a regressor has on the probability that an "average"
individual will be pro-trade (i.e., "disagree" or "disagree strongly" with trade restrictions).

III. A first pass: the naive demographic model
As a first pass through the data, we ignore economic theory and present some estimates
that relate trade attitudes to a laundry list of standard demographic characteristics. We use
information from other ISSP-NI questions regarding age, gender, citizenship, years of education,

11
area of residence (rural vs. urban), subjective social class, political party affiliation, trade union
membership and real income.6 The results are shown in Table 2.
We find strong gender and age effects on trade preferences, which survive virtually all
specifications we have tried. Column (1) in Table 2 shows that being a male increases the
probability of replying "disagree" and "disagree strongly" with trade restrictions by respectively
4.8 and 2.6 percentage points (both significant at the 1% level). In other words males are on
average 7.4 percentage points more likely to be pro-trade, which is quite a striking difference
given that only 23 percent of the sample overall is pro-trade. This gender-based difference in
trade attitudes provides us with an early glimpse into the important role played by values in
shaping preferences.7 Older individuals are significantly more protectionist. Citizenship in the
country and rural residence are both negatively associated with pro-trade sentiments.
Table 2 also shows that education and income are positively associated with pro-trade
attitudes. However, we shall significantly qualify both conclusions in the analysis that follows.
Individuals who identify themselves as being from the upper classes are more likely to be protrade, while political party affiliation has no significant relationship with trade preferences.
Trade union membership is associated with protectionist attitudes. Regressions without fixed
effects for countries (not shown) yield very similar results, except in the case of trade union
membership. When country dummies are excluded, trade union membership does not have a
statistically significant negative relationship with TRADE_OP. We interpret this to be the result

6

The log of real income is calculated using data in local currency on individual income from the ISSP-NI data set
and purchasing power parity conversion factors from the WDI (World Bank). Education refers to years of
education, with a maximum top-coding (introduced by us) of 20.
7

An alternative hypothesis would be that gender differences arise from the significantly lower levels of labormarket participation of women. Leaving aside the question of why this should produce the bias in question, this
alternative hypothesis is not borne out by the data. The strong gender difference persists even after we control for
whether an individual is in the labor market or not.

12
of a spurious positive correlation between high levels of union membership and relatively high
incidence of pro-trade preferences that arises from the presence of a number of continental
European countries, which on average exhibit both characteristics. This confounding effect is
eliminated in the presence of fixed effects.
When we modify the naïve demographics specification below, we shall drop some of
these variables (area of residence, subjective social class, political party affiliation and trade
union membership) because we would be losing too many observations to missing values
otherwise. We shall keep age, gender, citizenship and education as controls in all specifications.

IV. Economic determinants of individual preferences: The factor endowments model
Moving towards free trade, a country that is well endowed with skilled labor will
experience an increase in the relative price of skill-intensive goods and correspondingly
specialize in the production of those goods. According to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem,
skilled workers in all sectors of the economy will gain and unskilled workers will lose. A key
assumption of the factor endowments model--of which the Stolper-Samuelson theorem is an
implication--is that factors of production can move costlessly across economic sectors. This is
an extreme assumption. However, as long as individuals perceive themselves to be intersectorally mobile over the relevant time horizon, their preferences over trade policy will still be
informed by the underlying logic of the Stolper-Samuelson theorem. In this section, we test this
idea.
We use as our theoretical backdrop a world in which skilled and unskilled labor are the
only relevant factors of production. We do not have information on capital ownership, so we
shunt it aside by assuming that it plays an insignificant role in shaping comparative advantage,

13
perhaps because it is internationally mobile. Our measure of skill is years of education
(educyrs), which we have already used above.
According to the factor endowments model, an individual's trade policy preferences will
depend both on his skill level and on his country’s relative factor endowment. A skilled
individual will be pro-trade in an economy that is well endowed with skilled labor, but anti-trade
in an economy that is well endowed with low-skill labor. So we need information also on an
economy's relative abundance in skilled labor. We shall use three different measures as proxies
for relative factor endowments. The first of these is per-capita GDP. It is reasonable to suppose
that countries with higher GDP per capita are also better endowed with skilled labor. The second
and third measures are based on the actual average years of education in our sample for each
country.8
Before we present regression results, it is instructive to examine whether the estimated
effect of educyrs varies systematically across countries in the manner predicted by the StolperSamuelson theorem. So we first ran a series of probit regressions on individual countries, with
TRADEPRO as the dependent variable. In each case, we regressed TRADEPRO on educyrs
(along with age and male). In Figure 3, we plot the estimated marginal effects we obtained on
educyrs alongside each country's per-capita GDP. The result is striking: there is a very strong
and tight relationship between a country's per-capita GDP and the magnitude of the
corresponding estimated marginal effect of educyrs (the coefficient of per capita GDP is 1.53e06, robust t-statistic= 4.97, significant at 1% level). The richer a country, the more positive is the
8

We could have also used the Barro-Lee (1996 and 2000) data sets, but these suffer from some clear defects where
the countries in our sample are concerned. For example, when we construct a measure of relative human capital
endowment (high-skilled vs low-skilled labor) by considering no schooling and primary schooling attainment in the
low-skilled labor measure and secondary schooling and higher schooling attainment in the high-skilled labor
measure, we obtain that West Germany and Spain rank lower than the Philippines in 1990.

impact of a marginal increase of education on the probability of pro-trade attitudes. The
Philippines lies at the low end of the spectrum, and is without question the country with the
lowest skill endowment in our sample. The marginal effect of educyrs we obtained for the
Philippines is not only the smallest among all countries, it is actually negative (and statistically
significant at the 1% level). Greater education is associated with more protectionist views in the
Philippines--the only such case in our sample. These findings are quite in line with the StolperSamuelson theorem.
In Table 3 we show pooled regressions with country dummy variables where we take into
account the cross-country heterogeneity with respect to educyrs. In the first set of regressions,
we interact educyrs with log per-capita GDP, educyrs*gdp, and enter the two variables
separately. The previous exercise on individual countries suggests that the impact of educyrs
should depend on the level of per-capita GDP; that is, we should get a negative coefficient on
educyrs but a positive coefficient on the interaction term educyrs*gdp. This is exactly what we
get.9 Both terms are highly significant. Column (2) confirms that the result is robust to
controlling for an individual's real income. Columns (3) and (4) confirm that the pattern
continues to hold when we drop the Philippines and the other lower-income countries from the
sample.10 This is important evidence, suggesting that the non-linearity in educyrs is present for
the entire range of countries; it is not an artifact driven by either the Philippines or a small
number of low-income countries. Column (5) introduces an additional interaction term between

O'Rourke and Sinnott (2001) have independently replicated this result, even though their measure of skill is
different from ours. These authors use an occupational measure, in contrast to our educational measure.

The countries dropped are Poland, Bulgaria, Russia, Latvia and the Philippines.

15
individual income and per-capita GDP, income*gdp, to confirm that what we are capturing is a
non-linearity in the impact of education, and not with respect to income/earnings.
We next use an alternative measure of national factor endowments by taking the sample
average years of education in each country to construct an interaction variable, educyrs*educ,
which is the product of the latter measure with educyrs. When we enter both variables in
regression (6), we find results that are similar to those above. The estimated impact of education
on pro-trade attitudes is nonlinear--negative in skill-scarce countries and positive in skillabundant countries. The estimates are statistically significant as before.
Finally, we construct a third measure of country-level factor-endowments. We again
compute the average years of education of all individuals in each country (ek), then we calculate
a population-weighted average of national skilled-labor endowments of the countries in the
sample (e ) and, finally, we compare each country's value to this global average. We label sk the
measure of each country’s relative abundance of skilled labor and unsk the measure of each
country’s relative scarcity of skilled labor. The two variables are defined as follows:
sk = max ( e k − e, 0)
unsk = min (e k − e , 0)
Next, we construct two interaction variables, educyrs*sk and educyrs*unsk, by multiplying both
sk and unsk with educyrs. According to the factor endowments model, both coefficients on the
interaction variables should be positive. Our results, shown in column (7), are only partially
consistent with this prediction, with the coefficient on educyrs*sk being negative and the
coefficient on educyrs*unsk being positive. This result is most likely due to the way in which
the cut-off point e has been constructed, i.e. averaging national skilled-labor endowments only
over the countries in the ISSP-NI sample.

16
Overall, these findings are strikingly supportive of the implications of the factor
endowments model and of the Stolper-Samuelson theorem. Education is very strongly correlated
with support for free trade in countries that are well endowed with human capital. It is either
weakly or negatively correlated with support for free trade in countries that are poorly endowed
with human capital.11

V. Economic determinants of individual preferences: The sector-specific factors model
If individuals are, or perceive themselves to be, immobile across industries, their attitudes
towards trade should be determined by their sector of employment, rather than their factor type.
Individuals in sectors where the home economy has a comparative advantage should be protrade; individuals in comparative disadvantage sectors should be protectionist; and individuals in
non-traded sectors on balance indifferent or pro-trade. This is the central insight of the sectorspecific factors model.
In taking this insight to our data, we face an immediate problem. The ISSP-NI survey
contains no direct question about sector of employment. But it does provide fairly detailed
information on occupation (based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations
[ISCO] or national classifications). We do our best to infer sector of employment from this data
on occupation. Since our goal is to establish a correspondence between these sectors and

11

As we mentioned in the introduction, Beaulieu et al. (2001) interpret these data differently, as rejecting the
Stolper-Samuelson theorem. They note that skilled workers tend to be more pro-trade in virtually all the countries in
the ISSP sample. However, this overlooks the fact that the countries covered by the ISSP are at the high end of the
world income/skill distribution. Beaulieu et al. (2001) do note that the relationship between education and trade
preferences is reversed (Philippines) or weak (Bulgaria, Russia, Latvia, and Slovakia) in some of the individual
countries. But they do not find this to be evidence in favor of Stolper-Samuelson, largely because they rely on
tertiary enrollment per capita (a very problematic statistic, in our view) to rank countries according to their human
capital endowment. By this measure, the relative human capital endowment of the Philippines is the same as
Sweden's, Austria's or Japan's, while that of West Germany lies below Spain's, Bulgaria's, and the Philippines'
(Table 3 in Beaulieu et al.).

17
international trade data, we recode the occupation variables according to the industry
classification used in the World Trade Analyzer (WTA) data set. In particular, we end up reorganizing the data on the basis of a breakdown into 34 manufacturing industries as defined by
the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Since the occupation codes used in the ISSP-NI
data set are not always detailed enough to be matched with any single BEA code, we create in
addition new codes as combinations of the original 35 codes. This results in a total of 54 (partly
overlapping) sectors. We treat non-manufacturing industries as non-tradables. The details of our
procedures and the sectoral breakdown we use are discussed in Appendix II. In some cases, the
mapping is straightforward, as many occupational codes (e.g., "dairy and livestock producers,"
"chemical-processing-plant operators," or "aircraft engine mechanics and fitters") are directly
indicative of sectors. In other cases, it is impossible to assign an individual to a specific sector,
and this results in either a less precise recoding or in missing values.
We determine a sector's revealed comparative advantage/disadvantage by looking at the
sign of adjusted net exports in that sector (averaged over the years 1990-95). The adjustment is
meant to "correct" for the existence of overall trade imbalances. Hence, we define an adjustment
factor, λ, as follows:

∑ (M − X )
λ=
∑M
i

i

i

i

i

The indicator λ is positive for countries that have a trade deficit and negative for countries with
a trade surplus. In particular, λ tells us by what fraction imports in each sector would have to be
reduced in order to balance the trade account. Our measure of adjusted net exports in each sector
is the difference between Xi and (1− λ) M i . We then define the two sector-specific variables,

18
CAik (comparative advantage sector) and CDik (comparative disadvantage sector) for each sector
i in country k as follows:
1, if M ik − Xik − λM ik < 0, for sec torik = 1 ,..., 54
CAik = 
0, if M ik − X ik − λM ik > 0 for sec torik = 1,..., 54 or if nontradabl e sector
1, if M ik − X ik − λM ik > 0, for sec torik = 1 ,..., 54
CDik = 
0, if M ik − Xik − λM ik < 0, f or sec torik = 1 ,..., 54 or if nontradabl e sector
A sector is defined as a comparative advantage sector if its adjusted net imports are less than
zero and as a comparative disadvantage sector if its adjusted net imports are greater than zero.
Each individual is therefore assigned to one of three types of sectors: (a) a comparative
advantage sector; (b) a comparative disadvantage sector; or (c) a non-tradable sector.12
The first regression in Table 4 shows the results. An individual in a comparative
disadvantage sector is significantly less likely to be pro-trade compared to an individual in a nontraded sector (with a difference of 4.3 percent). This is highly supportive of the sector-specific
factors model. Perhaps surprisingly, an individual in a comparative advantage sector is also less
likely to be pro-trade than an individual in a non-traded sector, although the differences are not
statistically significant in this case.
The latter result can be rationalized by considering the original survey question, which is
meant to elicit preferences related to restrictions on imports only. In the presence of two-way
(intra-industry) trade, it can be rational for individuals to prefer import restrictions in their
sectors even when those sectors are large exporters on balance. Additionally, our sectoral
classification and aggregation procedures may have resulted in the lumping together of CA and

12

This is true unless (1) the individual has not reported his occupation; or (2) his occupation cannot be matched to
any industry code nor to the non-tradable sector; or (3) there are no data on imports and exports for his sector of
employment. In all these cases the individual is assigned a missing value.

19
CD sectors. Whatever the reason, the bottom line that emerges from this regression is that the
main cleavage in preference formation over trade lies not between the two tradable sectors but
between import-competing and non-tradables sectors.13
An alternative specification, which takes into account the presence of two-way trade, is
shown in column (2). Now we enter separately the actual volumes of exports and imports
(normalized by GDP) of the sector in which an individual is employed. The logic of the sectorspecific model (augmented by the possibility of two-way trade) is that the estimated coefficient
on imports should be negative. The estimated coefficient on exports should be positive to the
extent that individuals fear retaliation from abroad or see through the Lerner symmetry theorem.
We do indeed find a negative (and borderline insignificant) effect on the imports term. The
estimated coefficient on exports, however, remains negative and insignificant.
In columns (3) and (4), we carry out a joint test of the factor endowments and sector
specific models. There are essentially no important differences from the individual tests, and
both models survive. How do we explain this? A plausible interpretation is that a certain
fraction of individuals in our sample view themselves as inter-sectorally mobile over the time
horizon that is relevant to them, and a certain fraction think of themselves as stuck in their
present line of employment. The first group's trade preferences would be in accordance with the
factor endowments model, while the second group's preferences would be in accordance with the
sector specific model.
The ISSP data set contains some questions on mobility. In particular, individuals are
asked: "If you could improve your work or living conditions, how willing or unwilling would
you be to move to another town or city?" Answers to the questions range from “very
13

When we drop individuals employed in non-tradable sectors from the regression, we find no statistically
significant difference between the attitudes of individuals in the CD and CA sectors.

20
unwilling”(1) to “very willing” (5). The question relates to geographical mobility rather than
inter-sectoral mobility, but may still be indicative of the latter. This gives us an opportunity to
check whether willingness to move relates to trade attitudes in the manner consistent with our
interpretation.
We interact willingness to move with the CA and CD indicators used previously, and
enter the interaction terms along with willingness to move. The results are shown in column (5).
First, individuals with greater willingness to move are more likely to be pro-trade, as expected.
Second, the sign on the comparative advantage term (CA sector) now becomes positive, in line
with the original expectations from the sector-specific factors model (but the marginal effect is
insignificant). Third, individuals in CA sectors are less pro-trade if their willingness to move is
high (and this interactive effect borders on statistically significance). Fourth, individuals in CD
sectors express more pro-trade sentiments when their stated willingness to move is high,
although the interaction term is not close to significance. Hence the signs on the estimated
coefficients are all consistent with our interpretation, but the insignificance of most of the
estimates prevents us from reading too much support into this.

VI. Economic determinants of individual preferences: Relative-income/status model
In some of the specifications we discussed previously, we saw that an individual's real
income is associated positively with pro-trade attitudes, even after controlling for education and
other socio-demographic attributes. In this section, we refine this finding and demonstrate that it
is relative income within a country rather than its absolute level that matters.
Our measure of relative income is earnrel, which is the ratio of an individual's income to
the sample average income in the relevant country. Table 5 shows the results. In column (1), we

21
see that an individual whose income is double the country's average (earnrel = 2) is 7.0
percentage points more likely to be pro-trade than an individual with the average national income
(earnrel = 1). In column (2), we run a "horse race" between absolute income and relative
income, and show that it is the latter that wins. In fact, the estimated marginal effects of absolute
income change sign (and become negative) once earnrel is included. Column (3) shows that
self-evaluations of social status (social class) have a similar effect on trade preferences.14
Individuals who identify themselves as belonging to one of the upper classes are more likely to
be pro-trade. Finally, in column (4) we enter earnrel and social class together and find that they
are both individually significant.
The striking regularity that these findings highlight is that trade is generally perceived to
be a good thing for individuals at the high end of a country's income distribution, and a bad thing
for those at the bottom. These results survive various robustness checks, including embedding
the regressions in Table 5 in the economic frameworks we have discussed previously (see also
section VIII). We are not aware of any simple economic theory that would explain these
findings, and we leave the development of such a theory to further research. We note, however,
that our finding is consistent with another empirical regularity of the last couple of decades,
namely that expanded trade has generally been associated with a regressive impact on the
earnings distribution in both rich and poor countries.
Whatever the underlying story, one interesting implication of the relationship between
relative income and pro-trade preferences is worth noting. Consider a political-economy model
in which trade policies are determined by the preferences of the median voter (as in Mayer
1984). In countries with greater income inequality the median voter will normally have a lower

14

The correlation between earnrel and self-identified social class is 0.24.

22
relative income than in countries with greater equality. Consequently, greater inequality will be
associated with higher levels of trade protection across countries.

VII. The role of values, identity, and attachments
We have drawn attention to the importance of non-economic determinants of trade
preferences in the introduction. Indeed, some of our most interesting results pertain to the role of
values, identity, and attachments in shaping individual preferences on trade policy. These
attributes are particularly significant in explaining differences in average trade preferences across
countries. We consider three different specifications in Table 6.
First, we look at the impact of community and regional attachments (column (1)). We
focus on answers to the following questions: “How close do you feel to
o
o
o
o
o

(respondent’s neighborhood)?” (NEIGHBOR)
(respondent’s town/city)?” (TOWN)
(respondent’s county/region)?” (COUNTY)
(respondent’s country)?” (NATPRID1)
(respondent’s continent)?” (CONTINENT)

The four possible answers to these questions range from “not close at all” (with a value of 1) to
“very close” (a value of 4). The results show a clear pattern. Individuals with strong
attachments to their neighborhood, county/region, or nation tend to be less pro-trade. Such
attachments tend to be particularly strong in countries like Japan and Spain, and weak in Britain
and the U.S (see Table AIII.2 in Appendix III). On the other hand, individuals with strong
attachments either to their town/city or their continent--individuals that we may label
"cosmopolitans"--are more likely to be pro-trade.

23
The second set of issues we look at relates directly to patriotism, nationalism, and
chauvinism. In addition to NATPRID1, we focus on the following questions: “How much do
you agree or disagree with the following statements?
o I would rather be a citizen of (respondent’s country) than of any other country in the
world.” (NATPRID2)
o Generally (respondent's country) is a better country than most other countries.”
(NATPRID3)
o (respondent's country) should follow its own interests, even if this leads to conflicts
with other nations.” (NATPRID4)
The five possible answers to these questions range from "disagree strongly" (with a value of 1) to
"agree strongly" (a value of 5).
A careful analysis of the impact of patriotism/nationalism on individual preferences
needs to distinguish between various degrees of national attachment. On the one hand, national
pride entails feelings of patriotism, i.e. genuine attachment to one’s own country. On the other,
national pride can be associated with feelings of nationalism--or, in its extreme form,
chauvinism--i.e. sentiments of superiority of one’s own country. Smith and Jarkko (1998)
explain the difference between these two concepts:
National pride is the positive affect that the public feels towards their country as a
result of their national identity ... National pride is related to feelings of patriotism
and nationalism. Patriotism is love of one’s country or dedicated allegiance to
same, while nationalism is a strong national devotion that places one’s own
country above all others. National pride co-exists with patriotism and is a
prerequisite of nationalism, but nationalism extends beyond national pride and
feeling national pride is not equivalent to being nationalistic. Likewise, national
pride is not incompatible with cosmopolitanism (literally being a “world citizen”),
but nationalism (or at least a strong degree of it) is antithetical to a transnational
perspective. [references omitted]
NATPRID1, which inquires about a general sentiment of attachment to the nation, reflects the
degree of national pride/patriotism of an individual. NATPRID2 tests the extent of national
devotion in a stronger form. We interpret answers to these two questions as reflecting feelings

24
both of patriotism and nationalism.15 NATPRID3 matches perfectly Smith and Jarkko’s (1998)
definition of nationalism as a feeling of superiority of one’s own country. NATPRID4 applies
this nationalistic stand to a practical situation.
In a world where there are gains from trade at the national level, we would expect
patriotism to be positively correlated with pro-trade preferences. Regardless of distributional
implications, individuals who care about the country as a whole should be in favor of free trade.
On the other hand, patriotic individuals might lean towards protection if trade is viewed as a
zero-sum game between nations or its social consequences are judged as adverse. The results in
column (2) of Table 6 are more in line with the latter interpretation. There is a particularly
strong negative relationship between NATPRID2 and pro-trade views. This is significant in
explaining the cross-country variation in trade preferences, as NATPRID2 varies greatly among
countries. The percentage of respondents that would "rather be citizen of own country than of
any other country" varies from 91 percent in the U.S. to only 50 percent in the Netherlands
(Table AIII.2).
At the more explicitly nationalistic end of things, the results are as one would have
expected. Feelings of superiority of one’s own country presumably encourage thoughts of
national isolationism, and abstention from political alliances and other international economic
relations. Individuals who agree with the statement that their country "should follow its own
interests, even if this leads to conflicts with other nations" (NATPRID4) are significantly less
likely to be pro-trade. These individuals clearly perceive trade as a zero-sum game. The
percentage of respondents who agree with the proposition that their own country's interests

15

At least as defined in Smith and Jarkko’s paper (1998), national pride and patriotism are prerequisites of
nationalism.

25
should be followed even at the cost of conflict with others ranges from 73 percent in Bulgaria to
19 percent in Japan (Table AIII.2).
Finally, we turn to pride in specific national achievements. We focus on the following
questions: “How proud are you of (respondent's country) in each of the following?
o
o
o
o

The way democracy works (DEMOCR)
Political influence in world (POL_INFL)
Economic achievements (ECONPRID)
Social security system (SSS_PRID)

As might be expected, levels of pride are generally quite low in the former socialist economies:
only 9 percent of respondents are proud of the economic achievements of their country in
Hungary, compared to 83 percent in West Germany and 82 percent in the U.S (Table AIII.3). As
shown in column (3) of Table 6, pride in a country's democracy and economic achievements are
positively correlated with pro-trade attitudes.16 We take this to indicate that trade is less
threatening to individuals who have confidence in their country's political and economic
institutions. On the other hand, pride in a country's political influence in the world (where the
U.S. tops the list) is negatively associated with pro-trade attributes.
The last column of Table 6 shows a "kitchen sink" regression where we include all the
questions we have considered in this section. The results on individual questions are largely
unaffected, indicating that the relationships we have analyzed are additive.17 The bottom line is
that strong neighborhood/community attachments and patriotic/nationalist feelings are powerful
predictors of protectionist sentiment. On the other hand, confidence in a county's economic and
political institutions (including its social security system) moderates protectionist tendencies.

16

17

Pride in the social security system is also positively correlated with pro-trade attitudes but not significantly.

The significance of the marginal effects for category 4 (dPr(y=4)) are almost unchanged. While a few marginal
effects for the top category are not significant anymore, the signs are the same as before.

26

VIII. How well are we doing?
In Table 7 we present our preferred specification, based on the models we have
considered so far. The main constraint in formulating a "summary" model is that missing values
for specific questions result in a reduction in the sample size as more explanatory variables are
added. The specification in Table 7 represents our compromise. It is meant to capture the
essential insights of all the approaches we have used in explaining the formation of trade
preferences, with one exception: we have had to exclude regressors that relate to the sectorspecific factors model, because the sample size would become unacceptably low otherwise.
The basic specification is shown with and without country dummies. Note that there are
virtually no significant changes in coefficient estimates between the two versions. Note also that
the inclusion of country dummies does not greatly improve the overall fit of the regression. (The
models in Table 7 are OLS specifications, so that we can interpret R2 's in the usual fashion.)
Even without the country dummies, our preferred specification explains almost a fifth (18
percent) of the variation in trade preferences in our sample. Inclusion of the country dummies
raises the adjusted R2 only to 22 percent. In view of the complex nature of the issue at hand and
the imperfections of our data, we consider this to be a fair level of success at explaining attitudes
towards trade.
At the beginning of the paper, we highlighted the important differences that exist across
countries in average pro-trade orientation. How well does our preferred specification do in
explaining these cross-country differences? One way of getting at this question is to ask how
successful our model is at knocking out the statistical significance of country dummies. The
relevant results are shown in Table 8. In the first column, we present the estimated coefficients

27
on the country dummies when no other regressors are included in the regression.18 We exclude
the dummy for West Germany, so that the coefficient on the constant term represents the average
value of TRADE_OP for West Germany while the coefficients on specific country dummies
represent the differences in average values between the relevant country and West Germany. 19
With the exception of Japan, all the country dummies are statistically significant, indicating that
there is a statistically significant difference between average trade attitudes in each of these
countries and West Germany.
The second column of Table 8 in turn shows the coefficients on these country dummies
when the regression includes the regressors in our preferred specification. The key finding is
that 9 of the 15 statistically significant dummies in the previous regression are no longer
significant at any conventional level. And the magnitudes of the estimated coefficients are closer
to zero in all cases (except for Japan). What this indicates is that our specification is fairly
successful in explaining average differences in trade preferences across countries.
To see how this works, consider two specific cases, Poland and Sweden. In Poland's
case, the average value of TRADE_OP is 0.90 points lower (on a 5-point scale) than in
Germany. What accounts for the difference? We can apply the coefficient estimates in column
(2) of Table 7 to country-level averages of the regressors to arrive at an approximate
decomposition. Our results indicate that some 65 percent of the difference is explained by
differences in comparative advantage--i.e., more individuals associate themselves with skillbased gains from trade in Germany than in Poland--more than 20 percent by greater

18

Note that a number of countries had to be dropped because of the unavailability of data on some of the regressors
used in the preferred specification.
19

The country averages implied by these coefficients differ somewhat from the averages reported in Table 1 because
the sample in Table 8 is restricted to observations without missing values for the regressors in our preferred
specification.

28
nationalism/patriotism in Poland, and about 6 percent by the greater incidence of perceptions of
low social status in Poland. In Sweden's case, the average value of TRADE_OP is 0.33 points
smaller than in Germany. Since the patterns of comparative advantage and the skill distribution
do not differ greatly in these two countries, the bulk (roughly 60 percent) of the difference
between Germany and Sweden is accounted for by greater cosmopolitanism in Germany and
greater nationalism/patriotism in Sweden.

IX. Concluding remarks
Attitudes to trade are shaped by a complex set of determinants. As we have documented,
preferences over trade are influenced by both economic and non-economic considerations.
Values and narrow self-interest both matter. We close by summarizing our main findings.
•

Attitudes toward trade are significantly and robustly correlated with an individual's level
of human capital, in the manner predicted by the factor endowments model. Highly
educated individuals tend to be pro-trade in countries that are well endowed with human
capital (the U.S.), but against trade in countries that are poorly endowed with human
capital (the Philippines).

•

Preferences over trade are also correlated with the trade exposure of the sector in which
an individual is employed. Individuals in non-traded sectors tend to be the most protrade, while individuals in sectors with a revealed comparative disadvantage are the most
protectionist. Broadly speaking, therefore, the evidence is also consistent with the
implications of the sector-specific model, especially when an individual's stated
willingness to move is taken into account.

•

An individual's relative economic status, measured in terms of either relative income
within each country or self-expressed social status, has a very strong positive association

29
with pro-trade attitudes. Individuals who rank high in the domestic income distribution
or consider themselves to belong to the "upper classes" are significantly more likely to be
pro-trade. It is relative income, and not absolute income, that seems to matter.
•

Non-economic determinants, in the form of values, identities, and attachments, play a
very important role in explaining the variation in preferences over trade. High degrees of
neighborhood attachment and nationalism/patriotism are associated with protectionist
tendencies, while cosmopolitanism is correlated with pro-trade attitudes. Everything else
being the same, individuals who have greater confidence in the functioning of domestic
political and economic institutions are less likely to be protectionist.

Our overall empirical framework relies on a combination of the explanatory factors summarized
above. We have shown that this framework does a reasonable job of explaining differences
across individuals and a fairly good job of explaining differences across countries. We believe
we have made progress in answering the question in our title.

Appendix I: Model Specification: the Ordered Logit Model
The ordered logit model is built around a latent regression. Given
y ∗∗ = Xβ + ε ,
where y ∗ is unobserved, we define the probabilities of the five ordered categories as:
Pr ob( y = 1 / X) = Pr ob( y∗ ≤ µ1 ) = F(µ1 − Xβ) ,
Pr ob( y = 2 / X) = Pr ob( µ1 ≤ y ∗∗ ≤ µ 2 ) = F( µ 2 − Xβ) − F(µ 1 − Xβ)
Pr ob( y = 3 / X) = Pr ob( µ 2 ≤ y ∗∗ ≤ µ 3 ) = F(µ 3 − Xβ) − F(µ 2 − Xβ)
Pr ob( y = 4 / X) = Pr ob( µ 3 ≤ y ∗∗ ≤ µ 4 ) = F(µ 4 − Xβ) − F( µ 3 − Xβ)
Pr ob( y = 5 / X) = Pr ob ( y ∗∗ ≥ µ 4 ) = 1 − F(µ 4 − Xβ) .20
µ 1 , µ 2 , µ 3 and µ 4 ( µ1 < µ 2 < µ3 < µ 4 ) represent the cutoff values of the ordered logit
model while F( ) is the cumulative distribution function of the logistic distribution:
F( z) =

ez
1
=
.
z
1+ e
1 + e −−z

As in the logit model, the ordered logit model coefficients are not equal to the effect on
the probabilities of changes of the independent variables. The marginal effects of changes in the
regressors are given by:
∂ Pr ob ( y = 1 / X)
= − f ( µ1 − Xβ) ⋅ β
∂X
∂ Pr ob ( y = 2 / X)
= −[ f ( µ 2 − Xβ) − f (µ1 − Xβ)] ⋅ β
∂X
∂ Pr ob ( y = 3 / X)
= −[ f ( µ3 − Xβ) − f (µ 2 − Xβ)] ⋅ β
∂X

We present the same specification of the model as used by Stata, i.e. a specification without constant in Xβ .
Greene’s formulation (Greene 2000, p.876) of the ordered logit model includes a constant. Using Stata’s estimates,
20

we can calculate the constant in Greene’s model as follows: constant=- 1 .

∂ Pr ob ( y = 4 / X)
= −[ f ( µ 4 − Xβ) − f (µ 3 − Xβ)] ⋅ β
∂X
∂ Pr ob ( y = 5 / X)
= f (µ 4 − Xβ) ⋅ β
∂X
Greene observes that, an increase in the regressors keeping β and µ constant, has
definitely an unambiguous effect on the probabilities of the first and last categories. However,
the impact on the probabilities of the middle categories is ambiguous. Therefore, even a
qualitative interpretation of the coefficient estimates, i.e. of the sign of the changes in the
probabilities, may be misleading.21
In interpreting the ordered logit coefficients, one can use the following fact. A positive
coefficient estimate of βj means that, given an increase in the regressor X j , the probability of
category 1 (lowest) decreases and the probability of category 5 (highest) increases, as already
pointed out above. Furthermore, a positive coefficient estimate of βj also means that the
probability of the lowest two categories (1 and 2) decreases while the probability of the highest
two categories (4 and 5) increases.22
In quantitative terms,
∂ Pr ob( y = 4 / X) ∂ Pr ob ( y = 5 / X)
+
= f ( µ3 − Xβ) ⋅ β .
∂X
∂X
Stata numerically calculates the marginal effects of the regressors X on the probabilities
of the five categories (in correspondence of the means of X). For each regression, the effect of a
change in X on each of the five probabilities can be calculated.
Concerning the pseudo-R2, we use the formula:
pseudo-R2 = 1 - L1/L0,
where LO and L1 are the constant-only and full model log-likelihoods respectively.
For discrete distributions, the log-likelihood is the log of a probability, so it is always
negative (or zero). Thus, 0 >= L1 >= L0, and so 0 <= L1/L0 <=1, and so 0 <= pseudo-R2 <=1
21

“ The upshot is that we must be very careful in interpreting the coefficients in this model…. This point seems
uniformly to be overlooked in the received literature.” (Greene 1993, p. 674)
22

By probability of the lowest two categories, we mean the probability that the dependent variable is equal to 1 or 2.
Equivalently, by probability of the highest two categories, we mean the probability that the dependent variable is
equal to 4 or 5.

32
for DISCRETE distributions. For continuous distributions, the log-likelihood is the log of a
density. Since density functions can be greater than 1 (cf. the normal density at 0), the loglikelihood can be positive or negative.

Appendix II: Sectoral classification
Since in the ISSP-NI survey there is no direct question about industry, we infer sector of
employment from data on occupation. We use individual answers to two questions in the data
set, one asking for occupation according to an international code (the International Standard
Classification of Occupations [ISCO] from 1968 and from 1988) and another one asking for
occupation in terms of national codes. Individuals in each country give information about own
occupation according to only one of the classifications (either ISCO 1968 or ISCO 1988 or
according to a national classification). In particular, individuals’ occupations from the following
countries are coded according to ISCO 1968: Germany West, Germany East, USA, Austria,
Norway, Bulgaria, New Zealand, Spain, Slovak Republic. The occupation codes of this group of
countries are recoded all together. Respondents’ occupations from the following countries are
instead coded according to ISCO 1988: Hungary, Ireland, Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia,
Canada, Russia, Latvia. Again, we recode the occupation codes of this group of countries all
together. Finally, respondents’ occupations for Great Britain, Sweden, the Philippines, Italy,
Netherlands and Japan follow national occupation codes. Data from Great Britain, Sweden and
the Philippines are recoded individually. The national occupation codes for Italy, Netherlands
and Japan cannot be reclassified since they are not detailed enough.
We reclassify the occupation variables from the ISSP-NI data set in order to match the
coding in the World Trade Analyzer (WTA) data set, containing world trade flows from 1980 to
1997. WTA uses a slightly modified version of the Standard International Trade Classification
(SITC), Revision 2. However, in the WTA CD-ROM, information is also available in a different
format. Data are organized according to the 34 manufacturing industry basis used by the U.S.
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). (This coding is quite similar to the U.S. Standard
Industrial Classification.) The WTA CD-ROM includes the annual bilateral trade values
between all countries in the world in 1980-1997 according to this 34-industry classification. We
use the BEA classification to recode the occupation variables in the ISSP-NI data set and
construct a new variable indicating the individual sector of employment. The 34 industries (plus
one – Non-manufacturing – recoded as 35) are listed below. In order to obtain a more precise
match between the ISSP-NI occupation data and the BEA industry codes, we base the recoding
on a very detailed description of the correspondence between BEA codes and SITC Revision 2
(four-digit level) codes.
In addition to the 35 BEA industry codes, we create new codes as combinations of the
original 35 codes. This is necessary since the occupation codes used in the ISP-NI data set are
not always detailed enough to be matched to any single BEA code. The combined codes are
listed below. All individuals who cannot be assigned to a single or combined BEA code are
matched with either the non-tradable sector or with a missing value. Many occupations naturally
fall in the non-tradable sector (for example "jurists," "teachers," "workers in religion").
Individuals with generic occupations such as "company managers," "clerks," "secretaries," and
"bookkeepers," are assigned a missing value.
For each of the 35 original BEA industries, we consider sector-specific exports and
imports. For each new code, exports (imports) are obtained as sum of exports (imports) of the
sectors used in the combination (so, for example, exports of sector 36 are set equal to the sum of

34
exports of sectors 17 and 18). We then average both exports and imports over the years 19901995.
