ABSTRACT
Commercializing knowledge involves transfer from discovering scientists to those who will
develop it commercially. New codes and formulae describing discoveries develop slowly - with little
incentive if value is low and many competing opportunities if high. Hence new knowledge remains
naturally excludable and appropriable. Team production allows more knowledge capture of tacit,
complex discoveries by firm scientists. A robust indicator of a firm's tacit knowledge capture (and strong
predictor of its success) is the number of research articles written jointly by firm scientists and
discovering, "star" scientists, nearly all working at top universities. An operationally attractive
generalization of our star measure - collaborative research articles between firm scientists and top research
university scientists - replicates the impact on firm success. In panel analyses, publications by firm
scientists with stars and/or top-112 university scientists increase the number and citation rate for firm
patents. Further, star articles increase these rates significantly more than other top-112 university
scientists' articles. Cross-sectional analyses of products and employment show a similar pattern of
positive effects on firms' success of collaborations with stars or top university scientists, but estimates of
differential effects are non-robust due to multicollinearity. Venture capital funding has significant, usually
positive effects on firm success.

Commercializing Knowledge: University Science,
Knowledge Capture, and Firm Performance in Biotechnology
by Lynne G. Zucker, Michael R. Darby, and Jeff S. Armstrong
1. Introduction
Our research program over the past ten years has focused on the use of basic science
knowledge in commercial firms and the impact of that knowledge on firm performance. In our
earlier research, we have found substantial consistent evidence that top academic science,
specifically the star scientists who make most of the defining discoveries, provides intellectual
human capital that defines the technology of the firm—at least following scientific
breakthroughs. Though there are likely to be considerable spillover effects when knowledge is
created or employed (Jaffe 1986;1989), and perhaps also an important symbolic and legitimating
function of high quality science for commercial activity (Stephan and Everhart 1998), our
empirical work identifies the main and robust empirical effects due to real scientific labor
contributions of star scientists to performance of the firm.
To “detect” stars and quantify their labor contributions to firms, we identified 327 “star”
bio-scientists worldwide based on their publications of genetic-sequence discovery articles up to
early 1990 before gene-sequencing machines were in widespread use.

Stars were those

cumulatively reporting more than 40 genetic-sequence discoveries or on 20 or more articles
reporting any genetic-sequence discoveries in GenBank (1990).

We identified every “star”

article on which the star, or (more frequently) a co-author, was affiliated with a firm. The
numbers of these articles was our measure of the depth of star involvement in the firm.
Before turning to new results reported in this paper, a brief summary of our prior results will
be useful for readers not already familiar with our work:

1

•

Location of top, “star” scientists predicts location of firm entry into new technologies
(both new and existing firms), shown for the U.S. and Japan in biotechnology (Zucker,
Darby, and Brewer 1998, Darby and Zucker 2001) and replicated for the semiconductor
industry in the U.S. (Torero, Darby, and Zucker 2001).

•

Ties that involve actual work at the science bench between star scientists (mostly
academics) and firm scientists consistently have a significant positive effect on a wide
range of firm performance measures in biotechnology (Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong
1998; Zucker and Darby 2001) and in semiconductors for number and quality of patents
(Torero 1998). Ties to stars also shorten the time to IPO (firms are younger) and increase
the amount of IPO proceeds (Darby, Zucker, and Welch 2001).

•

As the quality of an academic star bio-scientist increases and his/her research becomes
more relevant to commercialization, the probability increases that the scientist conducts
joint research or moves to a firm. As expected scientific returns increase – measured by
citations to other local star scientists working with firms – the probability that the next
star will begin working with a firm also increases (Zucker, Darby, and Torero 2001).
Quality is also positively related to working with firms in Japan, but only number of
articles predicts significantly with this smaller sample (Zucker, Darby, and Torero 2000).

Our findings on the importance of basic university science to successful
commercialization of important scientific discoveries are confirmed in other research, especially
the importance of intellectual human capital (Di Gregorio and Shane 2000). Faculty are a key
resource in creating and transferring early, discovery research via commercial entrepreneurial
behavior (Yarkin 2000).

Jensen and Thursby (2001) confirm that active, self-interested

2

participation of discovering professors is an essential condition for successful commercial
licensing of university inventions. Thursby and Thursby (2000) find that the sharp increase in
university-industry technology transfer has not resulted so much from a shift in the nature of
faculty research as from an increased willingness of faculty and administrators to license and
increased interest on the part of firms.
In this paper, we continue our research program on the economic value of knowledge,
especially tacit knowledge at the time of commercially relevant scientific breakthroughs. We
compare the real effects on the performance of biotech firms of two overlapping groups of
academic scientists who collaborate with firm scientists: the stars who made significantly more
genetic sequence discoveries, and all relevant scientists (including the bulk of the stars)
employed at one of the top 112 U.S. research universities ranked by federal research funding.
Our overall results again support the strong effects of academic science on the success of firms.
Both science measures have strong positive independent effects on most performance measures.
The patent panels show that the labor effort of the stars has a significant incremental impact on
firm performance above and beyond the effects of all scientists from top research universities
working with the firm. In cross-section estimates, we find significant positive effects from either
star or top-112 faculty linkages but efforts to enter both sets of variables in the same regressions
are confounded by multicollinearity. We conclude that affordable bibliometric measures are
good but not perfect substitutes for the costly-to-construct star measures.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we develop our theoretical approach to:
(a) the sources and implications of the information advantage – common to most scientific
breakthrough knowledge – held by the discovering scientists, (b) the difficulties inherent to the
transfer of tacit knowledge that lead to joint research, and (c) the amount of knowledge capture

3

necessary for firm to offset sunk commercial development costs. In Section 3 we sketch the
history of scientific development and rise of the biotech industry, focusing on the ties between
academic science and commercial firms. Since data are the plural of anecdote, we present
qualitative evidence of the importance of ties to star scientists for the performance of the most
successful firms. In Section 4 we briefly review the variables and their sources and then present
and discuss the empirical results. We estimate poisson regressions (and linear-least squares for
employment) that explain the performance of a panel of biotech firms for patents and citationweighted patents, and cross-sections for products in development, on the market, and
employment. In these regressions, we systematically test the predictive power of science (stars
and top-112 university scientists tied to the firm via co-authoring of scientific research, as well as
all local academic scientific publishing by stars), venture capital, and other firm characteristics
such as use of the dominant technology (rDNA or genetic engineering). In Section 5 we offer
our conclusions. Detail on the data set and supplementary analyses are compiled in a separate
appendix which is cross-referenced below and available from the authors on request.

2. The Real Effects of Knowledge Capture
Academic to industry technology transfers may be rare, but we believe they can still
account for the bulk of technological progress. These are not pure “transfers,” but necessarily
knowledge captures to the degree necessary to offset sunk development, marketing, and other
costs invested in moving a discovery into a commercial innovation. Many fundamental industry
transformations or technological breakthroughs can be traced to specific advances in science.
While the industries experiencing technological discontinuity are a distinct minority in our
economy, we argue that a distinct minority of firms within this distinct minority of industries
account for a large part of the aggregate technological progress conventionally measured in
productivity studies (Harberger 1998, Darby and Zucker 2002).

Knowledge and the Market for Information
Our argument starts from the classic Stigler (1961) observation that information is a
valuable and costly resource and that individuals are thus motivated to adopt strategies such as
search that weighs the expected costs and benefits of acquiring information. For example, if
individuals’ search involves unique goods, then costs of search are sufficiently high that
transactions are commonly localized as a device for identifying potential buyers and sellers.
Stigler pointed out that medieval markets were an example of actual localization; advertising is
an example of a “virtually” localized market.
We argue that another mechanism of “virtual” localization is a profession, or more
commonly, a sub-specialty within a profession.1 Here, the buyers and sellers of knowledge,
including new or “breakthrough” discoveries, are brought together in a highly balkanized market
in which the participants share a reasonably similar endowed knowledge base that makes the new

5

knowledge potentially understandable and useable. The size and geographic distribution of that
knowledge base determines the extent of initial demand for the new knowledge.

For the

purposes of our argument here, information and knowledge are equivalent.

From Tacit to Codified Knowledge
New information tends to be produced in tacit form, increasing in tacitness as a function
of distance from prior knowledge (hence, especially breakthrough knowledge), and requires
resources to codify. Tacit knowledge tends to be highly personal, initially known only by one
person (or a small team of discovering scientists) and is difficult to transfer to others (Polyani
1962 and Schutz 1962).
As knowledge increases in complexity, the probability increases that deviation from
“textbook” description of action will be required (Nelson 1959 and Nelson and Winter 1982). For
example, internal bleeding during surgery requires decisions about whether and how to deviate
from the textbook that cannot be fully prescribed in advance. This kind of complexity leads to
knowledge remaining tacit longer, perhaps remaining an “active task” that changes its nature in
response to contingencies in contrast to an “inert task” such as a secretary typing a letter written
by his/her boss (Scott et al. 1967).
Knowledge becomes shared (inter-subjective) to the extent that codes or formulas are
borrowed from pre-existing knowledge and/or are newly created.

Relevance to earlier

knowledge allows borrowing of codes, mathematical expressions and relations, and even
machines that “embody” those codes/math. Such knowledge is cumulative and can be easily
understood and transferred, relying on references to the well-understood prior scientific
literature.

6

But new knowledge that cannot be readily grafted on to old is likely to offer more
opportunities.

Opportunity can shift incentives – increasing them along a continuum from

incremental change to breakthrough discoveries (Klevorick et al. 1995). Increased incentives to
enter arise from these greater opportunities.
Discovering scientists become important in technology transfer when a new discovery
has both high commercial value and a combination of scarcity and tacitness that defines natural
excludability, the degree to which there is a barrier to the flow of the valuable knowledge from
the discoverers to other scientists. Tacit, complex knowledge provides partial natural protection
of information, both separately and jointly with more formal property rights. Those with the
most information about breakthrough discoveries are the scientists actually making them, so
there is initial natural scarcity. To the extent that the knowledge is both scarce and tacit, it
constitutes intellectual human capital retained by the discovering scientists and therefore they
become the main resource around which firms are built or transformed (Zucker, Darby, and
Brewer 1998, Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong 1998). Hence, tacit knowledge can be viewed as at
least partially rivalrous and excludable information and thus “appropriable” as long as it remains
difficult (or impossible) to learn it.
As tacit knowledge becomes increasingly codified—or translated into “recipe
knowledge” as Schutz (1962) terms it – tacitness decreases and knowledge transfer is easier. But
significant barriers stand in the way of codification. Relevance between old and new knowledge
can be difficult to determine (Schutz 1970), increasing the demand for social construction of new
codes, formulae, and machines. The greater the discontinuity, the more difficult it is to anchor in
prior systems of knowledge.

7

Until there is a reliable indicator of the value of the new knowledge, the size of the
market for codification is unlikely to be large enough to cover the cost of developing the new
codes. Paradoxically, once the value is known:
•

If the value is low relative to alternative uses of scientific talent, then there are few
incentives to codify it.

•

If it is high, those few scientists who hold the new knowledge will have to weigh returns
to codification against returns to time invested in scientific research, a tradeoff that pits
knowledge transfer against knowledge creation.
o Hence, the average scientific discovery is never codified, and valuable discoveries
experience a significant codification lag that tends to increase with their value.

Knowledge Capture via Team Production
Knowledge that is cumulative builds on an existing set of words and symbols, and hence
involves less or no barrier to communication: Listening to a lecture or reading a text can suffice.
But tacit knowledge often requires that one of those already holding that knowledge work with
the novices to teach them in a hands-on process. For example, 81% of the new authors enter
GenBank by writing with old authors, and new authors write exclusively with new authors a
significant 36 percent less than “old,” experienced authors write exclusively with other “old”
authors after excluding all sole authored papers (Zucker, Darby and Torero 2001). Transfer may
be very effective – there are well-documented effects of cumulative experience on performance
improvement (Pisano et. al 2001) – but it is slow and requires the active participation of the
holder of the tacit knowledge.

8

Discovering scientists are

typically willing to transfer knowledge primarily in the

context of their on-going laboratory work. At the extreme, when tacitness is high, it is their
collaborators on their research team who are the recipients of this knowledge; others are
excluded through lack of access. Thus, the initial cost of entry is high. But entry cost tends to
decline over time, and the probability of an error in the initial discovery also declines as others
replicate it, thus reducing risk to the new entering scientist.2
This restricted process of transfer will more often than “normal science” lead to sufficient
knowledge capture to justify the cost of commercial development by a firm. Knowledge capture
explains why tacit knowledge tends to be highly localized: it will be concentrated geographically
around where the discoveries are made (or where the discoverers move). As shown in Figure 1,
there is considerable concentration of patented inventions, as well as human therapies and
vaccines in development and on the market. Just two states, California and Massachusetts with
14% of the U.S. population, have a disproportionate share especially of U.S. products in
development (49%) and on the market (58%). Patenting is somewhat less concentrated; since
patenting is both an input and an output of the innovation process, this may suggest a lessening
of geographic concentration, perhaps as the discoveries mature and are codified. Generally
patents provide a useful incentive to the codification of knowledge, but in the case of patented
cell lines a novel technique – deposit in an approved depositary to be publicly available upon
patent expiration – acknowledged the difficulty in codifying exactly how the new organisms
could be created.
Understanding the role of scientific teams in tacit knowledge transfer extends the
arguments for team production:

(a) Team organization makes routine the transfer of tacit

knowledge from the discoverer to other team members, and if team members cross

9

organizational boundaries then tacit knowledge is efficiently transferred – in the present case,
most interestingly from university discovering scientists to firm scientists (Zucker, Darby and
Armstrong 1998).

(b) Through team organization, more productive cooperation is often

achieved via specialization than possible through the linking of individual efforts across
impersonal markets (Demsetz 1995: p. 17).
The greater the labor effort of the discovering university scientist(s) with teams
containing firm scientists, the greater the amount of tacit knowledge transfer. In bench level
collaboration, you can actually see how the science is done.

As tacit knowledge transfer

increases from the discovering scientists, the success of the firm also increases. Thus, managers
of high tech firms have incentives to hire the top-discovering scientists if their discoveries have
commercial value. Discovering scientists also have incentives to found a new firm. In sharp
contrast, in industries where “normal science” reigns, hiring of below average, acceptably
competent scientists at a low wage is the typical practice (Kornhauser 1962). Obviously, each
can be a market-value-maximizing strategy for the firms facing different knowledge frontiers.

3. Scientists’ Leadership and Industry Success: Commercializing Knowledge
Biotechnology is a preeminent example of an industry undergoing very rapid growth
associated with radical technological change initiated in academe and based on basic science
breakthroughs. The key attributes can be summarized concisely:
•

Breakthrough discovery: Professors Stanley Cohen (Stanford) and Herbert Boyer
(University of California-San Francisco) reported the basic technique for
recombinant DNA, also known as rDNA, genetic engineering, or gene splicing
(Cohen, Chang, Boyer, and Helling 1973).

•

University scientists: We identified star bio-scientists based on genetic sequence
discoveries reported in GenBank (1990), an on-line reference file, and in this
paper introduce bio-scientists identified in ISI’s electronic file of research articles
written by at least one author located at one of the top-112 U.S. research
universities.3 Star articles are (nearly) a subset of top-112 articles (U.S. stars not
in a top-112 university and conference papers – less than 1% of the total star
articles – are not included in the ISI article files.)

•

Links/collaborations with firms: Articles that are co-authored by firm employees
and top scientists, including “stars” and the top-112 university scientists indicate
the intensity of involvement with the firm’s research effort.4

Most of these

scientists “wear two hats,” one as professor at a university and one as a leader or
lab head at a firm; confirmed through interviews at universities and firms on both
coasts.

11

Firm Success and Knowledge Capture
The degree to which an open scientific literature can produce such strong apparent
“knowledge capture” effects on firm success rests on: (a) Characteristics of tacit, complex
knowledge that lead to natural excludability; and (b) Selection by firms of discoveries for which
the degree of knowledge capture is likely to offset sunk costs incurred in making the scientific
discovery a commercial innovation.
To provide some intuition for our regression results, we first briefly review examples of
the prominent positions that top academic scientists are given in the most successful biotech
firms, identify their co-publishing with the firm, and finally explore the impact that top
scientists’ co-publications with firm scientists have on success.

Top 10 Biotech Firms
Individual scientists are often highlighted in an IPO prospectus.5

These scientists

typically achieved prominence in both their university and private sector appointments.
Examples of distinguished academics from the top-112 universities6 that were appointed to
corporate officer positions in one of the top 10 biotechnology firms (as of 1994) include: (a)
Herbert Boyer to the position of Vice President and Director of Genentech Inc;7 (b) Edward
Penhoet, former faculty member of the Biochemistry Department at UC-Berkeley and cofounder of Chiron, to the position of President, CEO, and Director of Chiron; (c) Walter Gilbert,
the American Cancer Society Professor of Molecular Biology at Harvard University and 1980
Noble prize winner, to several of Biogen’s boards, with Phillip Sharp, Professor of Biology at
MIT, and Daniel Wang, Professor of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering at MIT, on its
Scientific Board; (d) Two founders of Genetics Institute were university faculty, who also were

12

executive officers and directors of the company, as well as members of its Scientific Advisory
Board; and (e) Amgen included on its Scientific Board prominent university professors from
UCLA, CalTech, and Stanford, all members of the National Academy of Sciences.
Table 1 shows that 40 percent of these top-10 biotech companies reported at least one star
on their team when going public, while 70 percent had linked articles (star co-publishing with at
least one firm employee). Not surprisingly, because of the much broader coverage of both
scientists and universities, these top-10 biotech companies reported a higher percentage of top112 university scientists: 80 percent reported at least one top-112 scientist on their team when
going public, and 90 percent had core collaborations with one or more of these scientists. The
advantage of the publishing measure is that it weights the amount of involvement of the scientist:
for example, Centocor had only 1/20 as many core collaborative research articles as Genentech.
IPOs listed many former or current university professors as company founders, officers,
directors or key members of scientific advisory boards (see Appendix Table A1). Almost every
scientist holding a top management position had done so since the company’s founding. These
scientists were not brought in as part of the preparation for the IPO to merely “signal” the firm’s
success, contrary to a suggestion in Stephan and Everhart (1998).

Is Success in the Stars?
Certainly, scientists in high-ranking positions in these now public firms provide scientific
control and are important for firm success. However, the majority of firms in our sample do not
go public before the end of our time period. In any case, we are interested in the actual work that
top scientists do that is joint with the firm. We measure this joint work by the cumulative
number of collaborative articles.

13

Using the total number of joint articles, drawing on both of our science measures, we can
take a preliminary look at our findings by graphing the mean values of the cumulative number of
tied articles: for the stars, articles that involve a star scientist and a firm scientist (where the star
can also be an employee of the firm) and for scientists at the top-112 universities, articles that
involve joint work by at least one university and one firm scientist. These values are shown in
Figure 2a. The differences are particularly striking at the 10+ article level. The mean success by
tied star articles is consistently and markedly higher than for top-112 university scientists across
our major success measures: patents, products in development, and products on the market.).
Figure 2b presents the comparable data on venture capital funding (data from Venture
Economics). The amount of venture capital funding is less consistent in its effects compared to
tied/linked science results. While increasing cumulative amount of venture financing generally
increases both patents and products in development, the magnitude of differences is small
relative to the tied/linked science effects shown in Figure 2a.

Concentration of Success
Darby and Zucker (2002) argue that much if not most of technological progress is
accounted for by a relatively few firms operating in a relatively few industries undergoing rapid
change. We will just touch on examples of concentration here:
•

Industry Success Concentration: Top-decile biotech firms account for accounted
for 64 percent of the total number of human therapies and vaccines in
development (485 as of 1991), 43 percent of all patents, and dominated human
therapies and vaccines on the market (82 percent). See Appendix Figure A1.

14

•

Geographic Concentration: 64 percent of the total products in development are
concentrated in the top 5 states (Appendix Table A2); 58 percent of the total
products on the market are concentrated in those same 5 states (Appendix Table
A3).

15

4. Empirical Results

The Data
The Zucker-Darby star-scientists/articles database has been a powerful tool for exploring
the co-evolution of life sciences and biotechnology. However, that methodology involves an
expenditure of resources justifiable only for pioneering academic efforts or sophisticated
financial institutions.

As the ISI databases are increasingly available, the extent to which

electronic bibliometry can substitute for hand coding and specialized technical knowledge is a
question of practical importance to both academic researchers and industry practitioners.
Here we use the basic tool of co-publishing between academic and firm scientists as a
detector of joint research and (often two-way) university-industry technology transfer. The
Institute of Scientific Information (ISI, 2000) U.S. University Science Indicators database on
CD-ROM has extensive information on all the scientific articles with at least one author at any of
the top-112 U.S. research universities.
Table 2 defines all the variables used in the empirical estimates and provides summary
sample statistics for each. As in Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong (1998), we classify each article
in GenBank of which a star scientist is an author relative to each firm as affiliated with the firm,
as linked to the firm if the star is unaffiliated but writing with the firm’s employees, and
otherwise as untied to the firm. Aggregating over all stars and time for each firm gives the first
six variables in Table 2. The “local” in local untied articles refers to articles by stars affiliated
with universities or research institutes in the firm’s functional economic area (metro area plus
exurbs as defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis).

16

We attempted to find all articles written by any employee of each of our biotech firms in
the ISI (2000) database; these article also must have at least one top-112 university author to be
included. Among these joint articles, we focus on the “core collaborations” in the four central
biotech fields catalogued by ISI: biochemistry and biophysics; cell and developmental biology;
molecular biology & genetics; and microbiology. To control for variation in quality of the
collaborators, we also collected the number of citations in ISI-indexed journals in the current
plus next four years for each article.
The firm characteristics and the last five dependent variables were mostly collected from
paper directories and industry studies used by industry participants when looking for suppliers
and customers. This methodology is tedious but is one of the few available for analysis of large
numbers of privately (as well as publicly) held firms. As described in other papers referenced in
Table 2, considerable effort was expended in ensuring that uniform coding procedures were
applied to obtain quantitative variables from text records.
The primary exception was the venture funding data obtained by licensing the Venture
Economics database and deflating dollar amounts by the GDP deflator. We also had the list of
licensees of the UC-Stanford Cohen-Boyer patent as an alternate indicator of the use of
recombinant DNA technology. We bought our list of biotech patents from CHI Research, Inc.,
in 1997. We ensured that the CHI list included all those on U.S. Department of Commerce,
Patent and Trademark Office (1993) and appropriate others. Counts of citations to date by other
patents were included.

17

The Estimates
In a technology-intensive industry like biotechnology, patents are a crucial measure of
success. Patents serve as a measure of output from a firm’s “knowledge production function”
(Griliches 1990). The patent permits knowledge capture by establishing ownership rights to the
invention’s commercial rewards until the patent expiration date and even beyond expiration to
the extent the firm establishes brand recognition. Patenting success also impacts the firm’s
ability to raise public equity capital.8 Because patent acquisition is key to both financial and
non-financial measures of success and citations data are available with which to quality-adjust a
firm’s patents, the patenting success models are a key testing ground for the electronic version of
our star methodology.
Table 3 reports standard poisson regression estimates for panel data on U.S. patenting by
U.S. biotech firms.

The standard errors are corrected using the procedure of Wooldridge

(1991).9 Models a and e in Table 3 indicate that simple firm characteristics available for both
private and public firms do a good job of explaining patenting. Entrants are generally at a
disadvantage, experience helps, and use of the dominant technology (recombinant DNA or
genetic engineering) is a positive factor for both quantity and quality of patenting. As always
with forward-looking financial variables, the positive effect of the cumulative amount of venture
capital investment may confound real R&D productivity of the investments with forecasting the
effects of other, omitted variables.
Firms which have many articles with star scientists also tend to have many articles with
top-112 university faculty – indeed nearly all the linked star articles are also included in the top112 core collaborations count of joint faculty-firm articles. If one adds either the star variables
used in Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong (1998) or core collaborations and their mean citations (a

18

quality measure) as in models b and c or f and g, we see that either set of indicators improves the
explanatory power of the models. In the current case of patents and patent citations, the fit is a
little better with the new variables than with the star based variables, but we will see below that
just the opposite is true for all products and for human therapeutics and vaccines on the market.
The failure of local untied star articles to enter significantly positively reaffirms our (1998) result
that localized knowledge impacts of universities on industry are associated with market
transactions rather than uncompensated spillovers from the ivory tower. The coefficients on
cumulative venture capital investment are only mildly reduced by inclusion of either (or both) of
the star or top-112 based measures of the firm’s science base. This suggests that venture
capitalists in the 1980s were not much discriminating among biotech firms on the basis of
scientific depth, so that we obtain independent effects on research productivity of both
intellectual and financial capital. The significance of the knowable science-base information
implies that the capital markets were not fully incorporating it in allocating capital.
Models d and h in Table 3 experiment with adding both sets of science indicators at once.
Since linked star articles are generally included in the top-112 core collaboration counts, the
coefficient on linked articles measures the additional impact of stars on firm research output over
and above that of the “average” joint authorship with a professor from a top-112 university. The
coefficients for all core collaborations and their mean citations as well as this additional star
impact are positive and significant for patents and patent citations. The negative coefficient on
affiliated star scientists in these full regressions appears to reflect the special circumstances of
one or two firms which have the bulk of affiliated articles.
Unfortunately, the smaller samples for the cross section results in Tables 4, 5, and 6 –
comparable patent cross-sections are in the appendix available on request – seem more

19

confounded by the near multicollinearity of the science variables observed cumulatively up to
1990:

For the full models d and h, where both the star and top-112 article faculty-firm

coefficients are significant they have opposite signs. We would prefer panel estimates for
products in development and on the market and employment also, but each observation is very
costly to obtain from old paper directories for these predominantly private start-up firms. As
with the patent panels, we get generally significantly positive coefficients for linked and
affiliated star articles (models b and f in Tables 4, 5, 6) or for top-112 core collaboration articles
and their mean citations. Employment is the one dependent variable without many zeroes; so in
Table 6 we estimate the log of 1994 employment in accord with Gibrat’s Law (Sutton, 1997).
In summary, the empirical work strongly supports the central message that universityfirm technology transfer for breakthrough discoveries generally involves detectable joint
research between top professors and firms which they own or are compensated by. We have
shown that our electronic bibliometry provides good but imperfect substitutes for the more costly
to obtain and difficult to operationalize star measures. In particular, in large samples where we
can obtain separable impacts, star linkages appear to have a significantly larger effect on firm
research productivity than the average article written jointly by top research university professors
and firm employees.

5. Conclusions
Breakthrough discoveries in gene splicing set off a revolution in bioscience and created
the biotechnology industry. These discoveries set the stage, then, for increased opportunity and
increased incentives to enter. But significant natural barriers to the communication of new
knowledge often exist.

New knowledge tends to be developed in tacit form and requires

resources to codify. New codes and formula to describe discoveries develop slowly—with
insufficient incentives if value is low and too many competing opportunities if the value is high.
Hence new knowledge tends to remain uncodified, difficult to obtain except through hands-on
learning at the lab bench, and hence naturally excludable and appropriable. Our basic argument
is that knowledge close to breakthrough discoveries needs to be transformed into words, codes
and/or formula before it can be easily transferred.
Difficulties inherent to the transfer of tacit knowledge lead to joint research: Team
production allows more knowledge capture of tacit, complex discoveries by firm scientists. A
robust detector of tacit knowledge capture by the firm (and strong predictor of firm success) is
the number of research articles written jointly by scientists working at a firm and the discovering,
“star” scientists, nearly all working at top universities.

For firms to commercialize new

discoveries, there must be sufficient knowledge capture by the firm to offset sunk commercial
development costs.
We find the results reported in Zucker, Darby and Armstrong (1998) to be replicated to a
major extent in the whole U.S.

The principle finding in our earlier paper, covering only

California firms, was that research collaborations between firm scientists and university star
scientists (the ties) had a robust significant positive effect on firm performance. The local pool
of bioscience knowledge generated by nearby but non-collaborating scientists had no positive

21

effect, providing further evidence for embodied technology transfer through markets rather than
“knowledge spillovers.” But this paper is not simply a replication and scale-up.
In this paper we add a generalized form of our star measure: the collaborative research
articles between firm scientists and top U.S. university scientists. In panel analyses, firms whose
scientists collaborate with stars and/or top 112 U.S. university scientists have more patents and
more highly cited patents. Further, star articles have an incremental positive effect above top112 university scientists’ articles on the number and quality of patents. Our cross-sectional
analyses of products and employment show a generally similar pattern of positive effects on
firms’ success of collaborations with stars or top university scientists, but the incremental effects
are less systematic. This non-robustness appears to be due to multicollinearity. As predicted,
untied star articles are either non-significant or oscillate between significant positive and
negative effects. Venture capital funding amounts were always significant, and usually positive.
The overall importance of ties, compared to lack of significance or instability of untied
star effects, suggests that working jointly at the lab bench is a crucial transfer mechanism when
knowledge has an important or large tacit component. Further, our findings suggest that, as we
predicted, tacit knowledge is embodied in individual, discovering scientists.

Telephone

interviews conducted by Jeff Armstrong of university star scientists revealed their relationships
with firms were governed by tight contractual arrangements, academic scientists typically being
“vertically integrated” into the firm in the sense of receiving equity compensation and being
bound by exclusivity agreements. This evidence that star scientists were either fully employed
by firms or were governed in their relationships with firms by explicit contracts supported our
conclusion that firm success was not the result of a general knowledge “spillover” from
universities to firms but due to star scientists taking charge of their discoveries.

Most commonly, there are multiple virtually localized markets organized around competing

perspectives or models employed within the sub-specialty. There is also geographic localization
within the professions, with advantages to universities or cities with a “critical mass” of
scientists who can interact. Thus, UCSF with its critical mass of molecular biologists and related
sciences, and nearby strong universities, was “ripe” for a breakthrough.
2

Note that when multiple teams are racing for a “ripe” discovery and publish their results almost

simultaneously, we have much more rapid confirmation/validation of the discovery which
promotes faster learning by others. Gina Durante, graduate student at the Anderson School at
UCLA, suggested this point.

The top 112 universities are defined in terms of rank order on Federal research funding

received. The top 112 are defined by the Institute for Scientific Information and the data were
purchased from them.

In 1994, Jeff Armstrong conducted a telephone survey of randomly selected linked stars in

California and found that most possess a significant equity or founding interest in the firm.

The prospectuses were obtained from Thomson Financial Services. The ten companies in the

table were the top biotechnology firms in 1994 as reported by Lee and Burrill (1995, p.16).

Due to human subjects’ restrictions, we cannot reveal the identity of the star scientists. The

following scientists may or may not be included in our list of U.S. stars.
7

It is interesting that Genentech—with the largest number of star scientists of any firm—

appeared to avoid mentioning stars on its prospectus resume unless the star had a formal
corporate position. The one leading scientist who was listed on the prospectus was Dr. Boyer,

27

who made it a policy never to publish a genetic-sequence discovery article as or with a
Genentech employee.

See Darby, Zucker and Welch (2001).
The significance of key variables in these regressions is generally not sensitive to the

Wooldridge correction, but to achieve an estimate of the variance-covariance matrix that is not
restricted by first-moment parameter estimates, we apply the Wooldrige method as we did in the
California study.

An alternative would be to implement a binomial specification, but as

explained in Wooldridge (1991), this procedure may bias both first and second moment
estimates, whereas the Poisson process potentially biases only the second moment parameters.

Appendix – Supplementary Analyses
The tables and figure in this appendix provide supplementary analyses to those in the main text
and some additional detail on data used in the empirical analysis. The depth of involvement of top
academic scientists in the best biotech firms indicated in Table 1 is corroborated in Appendix Tables A1.
Appendix Tables A2 and A3 provide totals by states of the firms in the sample and the 1991 counts of total
products, human therapeutics, vaccines, diagnostics, and agricultural products in development and on the
market, respectively. Figure A1 shows how concentrated research activity is in the top decile biotech
firms.
Appendix Table A4 lists exactly which universities make the ISI’s top-112 list based on amount of
federal research funding received.
Appendix Table A5 reports the results of running the patent analysis as a cross-section without
exploiting the timing aspect of the data. The ability to have both star and top-112 science base indicators
in the regression simultaneously appears to be a feature of the fuller analysis and not of the patents per
se.
