The Demand for Variety: A Household Production Perspective
Reuben Gronau and Daniel S. Hamermesh
NBER Working Paper No. 8509
October 2001
JEL No. J22, D12

ABSTRACT
Product diversity pervades every modern marketplace, and economists have devoted substantial
attention to firms’ decisions about the supply of variety. This study looks at the consumer’s side by
discussing the demand for variety. Using the framework of the home-production model, we trace
differences in demand to differences in the opportunity costs of various activities. The cost differences
are associated with investments in human capital; and the resulting differences in schooling attainment
produce differences in time costs that in turn alter the kinds and variety of activities in which household
members engage. Using time-budget surveys from Australia, Israel, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United
States and West Germany from between 1985 and 1994, we find substantial differences among
households in the extent of variety in the nonwork activities that they produce. More educated individuals
generate more variety, engaging in both additional activities and the same ones as the less educated, with
most of the effect of education on the variety of nonroutine activities. There is more variety on weekends;
women engage in more different activities than men; young children add to variety in household
consumption/production, especially among women; and income effects are clearly positive.

Variety is the mother of enjoyment. Benjamin Disraeli, Vivian Grey
I. Introduction and Motivation
Product diversity is a salient feature of every modern marketplace. It is therefore
unsurprising that it has played an increasingly important role in economic theory. With the work
of Cournot it became the cornerstone of the analysis of oligopolistic competition, market structure
and market power. It has since expanded into the theory of international trade to become an
important element in the explanation of trade patterns. The emphasis in the literature, however,
has in general been on supply factors—on firms’ behavior (Chamberlin, 1933) and the optimal
diversity of supply, with consumer demand for variety taken as given.
Borrowing a page from Hotelling, it is assumed that the distribution of consumers’ tastes
in product space is given (uniform along a straight line in Dixit and Stiglitz 1977, circular in
Salop, 1977). The implicit assumption is that this distribution reflects the diversity of preferences
(i.e., different tastes) and is unaffected by economic factors, essentially ruling out the effect of the
standard economic variables, prices and income, as important sources of variation in consumer
demand.1
This neglect is not surprising. To analyze product variety one has to define the nature of
the product, a definition most economists tend to shy away from. Measurement creates additional
problems. The measure of product variety depends crucially on the level of data aggregation: The
greater the level of aggregation, the smaller the observed variety. The degree of detail in the data
(consumption and production surveys) depends often on the cost of data collection. An observed
increase in product variety over time can therefore at least partly reflect increased resources
devoted to data collection. This forces the researcher to infer the factors affecting variety from
differences in behavior among various socioeconomic groups in cross-section surveys.

1

Perhaps the only exception is Jackson (1984) who analyzed the effect of income on variety. More
important, in the now quite large literature on home production (summarized by Gronau, 1986 and 1997),
none has analyzed the variety of activities.

This is the path that we take here. The novelty lies not so much in the formal model but
rather in the framework used to analyze the demand for variety and in the breadth of evidence
that we offer. Instead of studying the demand for goods, we analyze the underlying demand for
activities, where each activity is “produced” à la Becker (1965) using goods and time.
Incorporating the time constraint into the analysis produces two departures from previous
research. Whereas the budget constraint on goods is a “soft” one that allows households with
higher income to indulge their tastes for variety without having to forego the consumption of
additional quantities of goods, the time constraint is rigid: Rich and poor, high-wage and lowwage, all face the same time constraint—twenty-four hours every day. Increased variety in time
use must come at the expense of the time spent on each activity. The time constraint binds even
more tightly where diversity of consumption activities is concerned, since consumption time and
material resources are often negatively correlated (because of the time spent working).
The other fundamental difference relates to price. In a world of linear pricing diversity
carries no cost. Nonlinear pricing schemes are relatively rare, and it is only natural that the few
researchers who have studied the demand for product diversity have ignored the price effect. One
cannot, however, ignore setup costs where time is involved. Switching among activities involves
time, and the amount of time “wasted” in this endeavor (for example, transport time) is far from
negligible. Setup costs must, therefore, be incorporated in the analysis of variety.
In our empirical analyses we use six bodies of data, time use studies from: Australia
1992, Israel 1991/92, the Netherlands 1990, Sweden 1993-94, the United States 1985, and West
Germany 1991/92. The analysis of variety confronts the researcher with problems unfamiliar in
other contexts.

Most statistical surveys measure economic activity (e.g., production,

consumption, trade) over relatively long time spans (a month, quarter or year). They focus
primarily on the total amounts of the activities that are undertaken over these long periods, and
only secondarily on their dispersion over shorter time intervals. Research using time budgets has
to console itself with much shorter time spans. Difficulties in data collection (e.g., recall

2

problems) limit the observation period of time-use surveys to one to seven days, and variety in
the number of activities increases with the length of time the subject is observed. This makes the
measure of variety very sensitive to the time span reported. Even a week may be too short to
capture the full extent of variation in consumption activity.
When the period covered by the survey is less than a week (e.g., all but the Dutch surveys
used here) the researcher is confronted by another problem—that of periodicity. Market work is a
major determinant of the time available for consumption activities. The constraint on
consumption time shifts between workdays and weekends, resulting in changes in the number and
nature of activities over the week. Temporal variation in the demand for variety is thus an
additional topic of this research.
The study opens with a theoretical discussion of the demand for variety in a homeproduction context. The analysis is followed by a description of the six data sets that we use, and
then moves to a brief discussion of the amounts of time allocated among different types of
activities. Most of the discussion of the empirical results deals with aspects of the demand for
variety, including its determinants, impacts on durations of activities, roles of routine and
nonroutine activities, and differences between variety on weekdays and weekends.
II. A Model of Variety in Household Production
Standard consumption theory pays little attention to the question of variety. The
representative consumer maximizes the utility function
(1)

U = U(X1,…,Xn)

subject to a budget constraint
(2)

n

∑ piXi = I ,

i =1

where Xi, pi and I denote the quantity of goods and their prices, and money income. The number
of goods available is arbitrary. The optimization rule states that the optimum market basket
consists of the goods satisfying the condition

3

(3)

ui/pi = uj/pj = λ

i,j = 1,…,m ,

where ui = ∂U/∂Xi is the marginal utility of good i, λ (the Lagrangian multiplier) is the marginal
utility of resources, and the goods are arbitrarily indexed to group them into the first m goods,
which are consumed, and the n-m remaining goods, which are not. These latter satisfy the
condition
(4)

pi < p i ,

i = m+1,…,n ,

where p i is the reservation price, i.e., the maximum price the household is ready to pay for this
good p i = u i (0) / λ .
In this model product diversity can be explained either in terms of the dispersion of
preferences (forsaking the assumption of a representative consumer) or by differences in incomes.
Changes in income are associated with changes in marginal utility λ, so that diminishing marginal
utility results in the expansion of the spectrum of goods consumed (m) as income increases.
When the consumer confronts a nonlinear price system that includes setup costs (e.g., the access
costs of maintaining a telephone or transportation costs to the location where the good is to be
consumed), the household consumes the good only if the consumer surplus it derives exceeds the
setup costs ci, i.e., if:
(5)

pi

(1 / λ) ∫ u i dX i (p) ≥ c i .
pi

The theory of household production creates the scope for a much richer explanation. In
this scheme (Becker, 1965) the subject of utility is not the good but the activity (Z), which in turn
is produced by combining goods and time (T) according to
(6)

Zi = fi(Xi, Ti) .

Maximization of the utility function U = U(Z1,…,Zn) is subject to two constraints: the budget
constraint (3), and the time constraint

4

(7)

n

∑ Ti = T ,

i =1

where T denotes consumption time, and income I consists of wages and nonlabor sources of
income. I = wL+V, where w denotes the wage rate, L labor time inputs, and V nonlabor income.
When the household is free to choose its labor time inputs (L), income (and the budget constraint)
become an endogenous part of the model, and the household faces one ultimate constraint—the
total time constraint (T0):
(8)

T + L = T0 .
Optimization leads to the choice of producing/consuming those m activities that satisfy

the condition
(9)

ui /πi = λ , i = 1,…,m ,

where ui =∂U/∂Zi is the marginal utility of activity i, λ is the marginal utility of “effective time”
[T0 + (V/w)], and πi denotes the marginal time cost of producing activity i. The marginal cost of
the activity consists of two parts: The market time required to secure purchased inputs, and the
home time required to produce the activity. The full price is then
(10)

πi = (pi /w) xi + ti ,

where xi = ∂Xi/∂Zi and ti = ∂Ti /∂Zi are the marginal goods and time inputs. The diversity of
activities depends on the number of activities satisfying the condition
(11)

π i > π i , i = 1,…,m,

where π i is the reservation price ui(0)/λ .
In this model the diversity of activities undertaken arises not merely from the dispersion
of preferences and incomes, but also from the dispersion of prices. Whereas the standard model
assumes that all households face the same set of product prices pi , this assumption does not hold

5

for the set of activity prices πi . Differences in investments in human capital lead to differences
in activity prices and affect the variety of activities undertaken.
Here an increase in nonlabor income V increases the “effective-time” constraint and has
the traditional income effect on variety. Assuming V = 0, a wage increase has a pure price effect.
It lowers the market-time component (pixi/w) and changes relative prices in favor of goodsintensive activities. The time released from time-intensive activities may allow the expansion of
the activity set and the incorporation of additional goods-intensive activities. An increase in the
wage rate in a model where labor supply is exogenous increases the “shadow price” of time and
will have a similar effect.
Schooling is associated with increased productivity in the market. It has been argued
(Michael, 1973) that it also contributes to productivity at home. If more educated people are more
adept at planning, coordinating and streamlining their tasks, then marginal time inputs ti will
decline with schooling. Schooling will, therefore, be negatively correlated with shadow prices πi
and will increase the variety of activities undertaken.

2

Nonlinear pricing schemes are relatively rare where the prices of goods are concerned.
They are ubiquitous in the world of activity prices. The switch from one activity to the next
involves setup costs, either in the form of “unused” time intervals (i.e., “rest” or “waiting”) or in
the form of transport time (walking or other travel). With the introduction of setup costs (both
monetary and time) an equation like (11) in π i and πi determines the consumer-producer’s
decision whether to undertake activity i. These setup costs are usually relatively time-intensive
and will therefore tend to increase the cost of the activity to people with a high price of time,
causing the wage effect on variety to be more negative. Schooling, on the other hand, will help in
coordinating the flow of activities and allow more educated individuals to conserve on “wasted”
2

Schooling may increase the variety of goods consumed independent of any effect on the variety of
activities undertaken if more educated people are better suited to undertake complex production processes
(processes that involve a large number of products). The issue is whether the impact of schooling on
household production technology is neutral or not.

setup time. In this case of nonlinear pricing an activity will be undertaken only if the consumer
surplus generated by starting the activity exceeds the setup costs—and schooling should lower
setup costs for all activities.
III. Time-Budgets in Six Countries
Time-budget surveys in the United States go back at least to Sorokin and Berger (1939).
They are relatively scarce worldwide, perhaps because their limited administrative uses reduce
funding opportunities for them. Such data are based on daily diaries, but always have to rely on
the respondents recollecting at least 24 hours, which limits the length of period covered by the
surveys. As a result most time-budget samples are relatively small (not much more than 10,000
respondents) and cover relatively short time periods (up to a week). Given these data constraints
and the large variability in survey methods, we adopt a research strategy based on width rather
than depth. In the absence of large samples for one country we use the available smaller ones
covering six different countries. While this choice is dictated by the small sample sizes available
within any one country, this data constraint provides the opportunity to examine the robustness of
most of the results by comparing them under the different definitions of variety imposed by the
surveys’ methods.
The Australian Time Use Survey of 1992 (ABS, 1993) is the second largest of the data
sets used here. It is a random stratified sample of roughly 7000 individuals on two days each,
with only 1 percent of those who completed a diary on one day failing to provide two days of
diary information. The days on which diaries were kept were typically successive, so that the
hebdomadal distribution of observations is nearly uniform (and the number of weekend days is
thus roughly 40 percent of the number of weekdays). Individuals were asked to list when they
began each new activity, and their responses were then coded into 280 separate categories of
activities. The activities could encompass as few as 5 minutes, with the upper bound on the
length of an activity being the full 24 hours. Moreover, at each point the diary provided space for
the respondent to list up to two other activities in which he or she was engaged. In addition to the

7

individuals’ time diaries one person in each household responded to an interview survey detailing
the household’s characteristics.
The Israeli Time Use survey was conducted in November 1991-April 1992 (CBS, 1995).
It covered 3081 Jewish Israelis who reported their activities on 4840 days. The survey is based on
self-recorded diaries (covering about one-quarter of the days) and recall diaries based on
interviews. 1712 people reported only one day, 994 – two days, and the rest three (or even four)
days. The day was divided into fifteen-minute intervals (except for thirty-minute intervals
between 12:30AM and 4AM), and respondents were asked to report the main activity (out of a
list of 87) they were engaged in during each interval. Thus unlike in the Australian data activities
that might be regarded as secondary (e.g., listening to the radio) may suffer from underreporting,
as will may short-duration activities (less than 15 minutes).
The Dutch Tijdbestedingsonderzoek (NIWI, 1993) is a quinquennnial cross-section timebudget study that has been conducted since 1970. In our analysis we use the survey conducted in
October 1990, in which 3415 individuals completed usable diaries of their activities. The survey
divided respondents into two roughly equal groups, with individuals in one half-sample
completing diaries for seven consecutive days (Sunday through Saturday) in one week, and the

each quarter-hour of the previous day. The range of possible activities encompasses 203 separate
usable categories.4 As in the Israeli sample, no secondary activities are reported.
The 1993-94 Swedish Time Use Survey (Flood, 1997) contains time diaries completed by
roughly 4000 respondents to a household interview study. Sample respondents were randomly

3

For half the sample the Sunday included the day when the Netherlands went off summer time. Thus for
those individuals on that day there were 1500 total minutes, a difference for which we account in all the
following empirical work using this sample. The effect on human activity of this temporary relaxation of
the time constraint is analyzed in Hamermesh (2001).

allocated (non-holiday) days over a twelve-month period, with weekend days accounting for
nearly half the sample days. A total of 72 activities could be listed; and each respondent could
list a secondary activity for any time interval. As in the Australian data, the diaries allowed
respondents to indicate at five-minute intervals that they began a new activity.
There have been no large-scale national time-use surveys in the United States since 197576 (reported in Juster and Stafford, 1985). Several sociologists led by John Robinson (see
Robinson and Godbey, 1999) have, however, occasionally obtained time diaries from American
respondents; and the Americans’ Use of Time 1985 survey was large enough (nearly 5000
respondents) to provide the kind of variation needed here. Each respondent filled out one
retrospective (day-after) diary of his/her activities, listing activities at no shorter than fifteenminute intervals, with only one activity listed per time period. A total of 87 activities was
possible, essentially the same coding as in the Israeli survey. The hebdomadal distribution is
almost uniform.
The 1991-92 German Zeitbudgeterhebung (Statistiches Bundesamt, 1999) covered both
West and East Germany and was structured quite similarly to the Australian survey. It allowed
for large numbers of possible activities and time units disaggregated to five-minute intervals, as
well as for secondary activities. The sample is slightly larger than the Australian sample, making
this the largest of the six data sets used here. Essentially no one failed to fill out diaries for both
days. Because the survey was undertaken very shortly after the German reunification, we use
only observations from the former West Germany.
Given the short time spans covered by the surveys, the observations on time allocation
are susceptible to nonrandom variation. The major sources of such variation are institutional
arrangements relating to work schedules. In all the countries except Israel behavior on Saturdays
and Sundays is likely to differ from that on the weekdays Monday through Friday. (In Israel
Saturday is a “free” day and Friday is at most a “short” workday, so that we treat Friday and
Saturday as the weekend there.) Because of these differences we pay some attention to how

9

behavior differs on weekdays and weekends and use these differences to shed light on the
theoretical discussion.
Not all the “completed” time diaries are complete for our purposes. In most of the
countries one of the activity categories was something like “no activity coded.” In order to avoid
contaminating the results we discarded any diary-day that included a time interval for which no
activity was coded. In the Swedish study this accounted for 12 percent of all days, but in the
others the losses were tiny. The age distributions of the respondents differ across the samples;
but all the surveys included individuals between ages 18 and 69 inclusive, so that we restrict all
the samples to that age range. Finally, because marital status is likely to be crucial in determining
behavior, and because the samples of unmarried individuals are often quite small, all of our
analyses are restricted to married persons.

5

Educational systems obviously differ among the five countries, to the point even that
years of schooling are not always comparable across the samples. Accordingly, we rely on the
respondents’ reports of the level of schooling obtained (e.g., in the United States less than high
school, high school, more than high school), dividing each sample into three educational
categories, with the sizes of the low-, middle- and high-education groups varying across the
samples. For each country we inferred the appropriate aggregations from conversations with
people who had gone through the educational system.

6

The theoretical model focuses on three key economic variables: resources, prices and
productivity. To separate their effects one needs accurate and detailed data on unearned income,
wage rates and factors contributing to productivity at home. Most researchers using time budgets

5

In the Swedish data marital status also includes information on whether the individual is a cohabiting
partner. We performed all the analyses in this study on samples of both married and cohabiting partners,
with results that differ little from those presented in the text.

6

For Israel and the U.S. we relied on our own experiences. We are thankful to Damien Eldridge for
information on Australia, Gerard Pfann for the Netherlands, Anders Klevmarken for Sweden and John
Haisken-De New for West Germany.

10

are not that fortunate. Time-budget surveys channel most of their effort to the collection of the
time diaries, and relatively little is done to assure the quality of the income and earnings data,
measures that are prone to substantial response errors even in the best of circumstances (Bound et
al, 1994).
None of the surveys contains direct observations on wage rates. One could impute these
data indirectly from information on personal earnings and market work time in several of the data
sets, but measurement errors and selectivity biases dominate the results. There are no usable
wage or income data in the American sample, and the Dutch data on this are extremely weak. For
Israel we use the variable “family income, personal earnings excluded,” which should provide
estimates of pure income effects. The Australian sample provides good measures of family
income, but the data on personal incomes include both earnings and nonlabor income. We thus
form a measure similar to that for Israel, except this one includes all income accruing to other
household members. The measure may be contaminated, because it excludes the respondent’s
nonlabor income, but it should enable us to exclude own-price effects in the estimates. In the
West German data information on both spouses’ incomes is available, so that we use spouse’s
income to proxy the other income available to the respondent. In the Swedish data we use the
respondent’s gross hourly earnings, so that this market price measure will confound substitution
and income effects (and will, of course, also be characterized by selectivity problems).
The only other variables used consistently in the regression analyses are measures of the
ages and numbers of children in the married persons’ households. Our general rule is to include
measures of the number of children and indicators of the age of the youngest child. These latter
necessarily differ in definition across the samples; but we can classify them generally as
indicating whether the youngest child is pre-school, pre-teen or a teenager (although in one
country, Australia, youths over age 14 are not included as children in the data set). Where
meaningful additional demographic information is available, it is also included. Thus in the
Israeli data indicators of the presence of health problems are included; and in that and the

11

Australian samples indicators of country of origin and metropolitan residence are available. In
the Australian data we also include information on whether the respondent speaks a foreign
language at home.
The analysis deals with consumption activities. Work, in the market or at home, usually
involves multi-task activities. These tasks are, however, often dictated by outside factors (i.e., the
employer) and the nature of the job. Moreover, most time-budget studies report home activities
in detail, while market activities are only reported in aggregate terms (i.e., primary job, secondary
job, etc.). The distinction between consumption and work activities is not always easy, especially
where work at home is concerned. Psychic income (i.e., direct utility derived from the activity) is
sometimes an important consideration affecting the decision about how much time to spend on a
household-work activity.
activities.

This is particularly true for such borderline cases as child-care

Recognizing, however, the need to distinguish work from nonwork activities,

throughout this study we define work as including market work, cleaning and cooking at one's
residence, and shopping, with nonwork encompassing all other activities.
In analyzing time use, as opposed to its diversity, we distinguish among several types of
nonwork activity, including child and family care, personal care and “leisure” activities. Both of
the latter are mainly consumption activities in terms of Becker’s model, but we expect the
variation in time spent in personal care to be smaller than that in leisure. We thus examine the
determinants of time spent on each of these three types of nonwork activity.

7

For each respondent-day the central concept in this study is the number of different
nonwork activities in which the individual is engaged on that day. We focus on the variety of

7

The level of disaggregation is clearly limited only by the number of fundamental activities coded from the
diaries (shown in Table 1). Choices in the (sparse) economics literature have varied from seven in
Kooreman and Kapteyn (1987) to three in Biddle and Hamermesh (1990), compared to our five (market
and home work and the three categories of nonwork activity).

nonwork activities and present all results for this set of activities.8 The minimum number of
activities that we observe in the five samples on a diary-day is one, while the maximum possible
is the number of nonwork activities that could be coded (from 40 in Sweden to 202 in Australia).
Even in Australia, however, no respondent reported more than 32 different nonwork activities on
a single day.
For comparison purposes Table 1 summarizes most of the essential characteristics of the
six samples that underlie this study.9 In addition to the characteristics of the data already
discussed we note the number of possible nonwork activities in each sample. The table illustrates
the diversity of the samples in terms of the numbers of possible activities, the range of days on
which diaries were obtained, and the degree of temporal disaggregation possible in the diaries.

IV. First Impressions
A. The Allocation of Time Among Activities
Although a substantial sociological literature has generated tabulations of time spent on
different activities (see, e.g., most of the articles in Merz and Ehling, 1999, and the references
therein), with much of the focus on sex differences, there are several reasons for reexamining
such tabulations here. Most studies examine only one country’s data, obviating the chance to
discern general, possibly universal patterns.

Thus we may learn something about general

differences in the allocation of time by sex if we examine time allocation in six countries using
exactly the same methods and definitions. Second, and more important, we cannot understand

8

For the Israeli and Dutch data, on which we experimented before adding the other four data sets, we
estimated equations describing variety along these other dimensions, both broader and narrower. The
results for the narrower set of categories, leisure activities, including the results on our measures of
schooling, were qualitatively very similar to those reported in the text for the measures of variety in
nonwork activities. For the total of all activities the results were somewhat stronger, mainly because the
additional schooling is associated with more time in market work. Excluding child and family care
activities also does not alter the results qualitatively, nor does excluding transportation activities.

9

The numbers of observations actually used in the analyses are presented in the tables showing regression
results. These fall far short of the total sample sizes due to the restrictions on age and marital status, and to
missing variables on both the respondents’ characteristics and in the diaries themselves.

13

the production of variety unless we know the context of time use in which it is produced. The
analysis of time use presented in this subsection is based on Tables 2a and 2b, which list the mean
minutes per day allocated to market work, home work, childcare, personal care and leisure
separately by sex and schooling level for each of our six samples. Each statistic is presented for a
“representative day”—a weighted average of the observations in each cell that reflects the
average allocation of time across weekdays and weekends.
Consider first the sex differences in time allocation demonstrated by comparing results
between Tables 2a and 2b. The data replicate most of the well-known sex differences, including
greater market work, less home work and less childcare by men. The greater allocation of time in
personal care by women is less well known, but it reproduces findings for the U.S. by Biddle and
Hamermesh (1990) on sleep, by far the largest component of personal care. The bottom row for
each category of individuals shows the total nonwork time (childcare, personal care and leisure).
In all six countries men’s greater market workhours more than compensate for their lesser time
spent in home work, so that total nonwork time is less among men than women. Much less well
known are the differences in leisure time between men and women. In Australia and the United
States the differences in leisure time by sex are essentially zero; but in the other four countries
married men consume more leisure than do married women. The sex differences in leisure time
are opposite those in time spent on personal care, with the total of leisure time and personal care
typically about the same by sex or slightly lower among men.
Even within these gender differences there are some international differences that are
enlightening. If one examines the sex ratios of time spent on market work, home work and
childcare, Sweden has the greatest degree of equality in all three categories. Swedish women’s
time use is more like that of men than is true of women elsewhere. This similarity is not only in
Swedish women’s well-known (OECD 2000, Table B) attachment to the labor force, but also in
their nonmarket work and childcare. Also striking is the consistently lower consumption of
leisure by Americans—both married men and married women. The data make it clear that

14

Americans’ relatively long market workweeks are not fully offset by reductions in home work,
personal care or childcare. That Germans consume even less leisure is due to their relatively high
reported time spent in home work.
The effect of schooling on time spent in market work, mainly through its effect on wages
and then on labor supply, is one of the best-established facts in labor economics. It is replicated
here for all countries and both sexes. Among women the positive relation between schooling and
market work is accompanied by a negative relation between home work and schooling. Among
men the home work-schooling relationship is slightly negative or zero, so that the effect of
schooling on total work is less than is indicated by its effect on market work alone. As a result, in
all countries but Germany, and for both sexes, there is a nonnegative schooling—total work
gradient. This means that the total amount of time available for nonwork activities, and thus the
possibility of generating more diversity in nonwork activities, is less among more educated
people in five of the six countries.
The implied non-positive correlation between nonwork time and schooling is further
borne out by the results of the detailed regression analyses presented in the Appendix (where
even in Germany there is essentially no partial relationship). The estimates also reveal a U-shaped
relationship between nonwork time and age (reflecting the age-market work profile), a negative
effect of preschool children on their fathers’ nonwork time and a positive effect on their mothers’
nonwork time (not reported in the Appendix). The income effects, estimated for Australia, Israel
and West Germany are generally negative but small, corroborating the often incorrectly-signed
impacts produced in the few previous studies that examine these issues using time-budget data
(e.g., Kooreman and Kapteyn, 1987; Biddle and Hamermesh, 1990).
B. Variety of Activities
Table 3 presents the means and their standard errors of the number of nonwork activities
undertaken on a representative day by the married respondents in our six samples. Remembering
the international differences in the number of possible activities in the surveys, these tables make

15

it quite clear that, where more activities are possible, more activities are coded as having been
undertaken. Australia, the Netherlands and West Germany, which have at least twice as many
possible nonwork activities as the other countries, show higher mean numbers of activities
performed than do the other countries. Australia, which had the most possible activities, is
highest, while Sweden, which had the fewest possible, is lowest. The international differences,
however, are not huge and are far less than proportional to the differences in the number of
possible activities. Comparing men and women, the most striking difference is that women
engage in more nonwork activities than do men.

10

Looking at the sources of variety, it is clear

that the gender difference stems from women’s undertaking more child-care related activities.
One of the central hypotheses of this study is that additional schooling generates greater
household productivity in the form of the ability to produce more variety. Comparing the mean
consumption of variety across schooling level provides an initial look at this hypothesis. For both
sexes we find a general rise in the number of different nonwork activities undertaken as the level
of education rises (even though in most of our data sets better educated people have less time
available in which to undertake nonwork activities). The only exception is for men in Sweden.
Whether because of a causal relation between schooling and efficiency in household production,
or because people with a greater taste for variety that is not captured by their observable
characteristics invest more in human capital, is unclear from these descriptive statistics; but the
existence of this positive simple correlation is abundantly clear from this six-country analysis.
V. Detailed Analysis of the Demand for Variety
While some interesting patterns are apparent in the means presented in Table 3, it is
unclear whether these are true partial effects. In several of the countries schooling attainment,

10

In Australia the total number of different activities, including secondary activities, is 9.51 for men and
10.30 for women in Sweden, 8.09 and 8.56, and in West Germany, 10.51 and 11.77. Including reporting of
secondary activities adds almost nothing to our measure of variety in the Australian data, and not a huge
amount even in the Swedish data. (In the Australian data the amount of time in which secondary activities
are coded is only 5 percent of the day among men and 6 percent among women. In the Swedish data the
comparable percentages are 27 and 28, while in West Germany the percentages are 90 and 91 respectively.)

16

our central focus, is highly negatively correlated with age, confounding its effects with those of
aging. In all but Sweden there is also a significant negative correlation between education and
family size, holding age constant. We thus present regression estimates of the impacts of the
education, age and family structure measures on variety. Throughout this section we list robust
standard errors that account for the multiple observations (diary-days) included for most of the
respondents in all but the American data sets. The sample sizes listed indicate the number of
different individuals included in the regressions. All the estimates are for a representative day.
The central results of this study are contained in Tables 4a and 4b, which list the
parameter estimates from regressions describing the respondents’ demand for variety (measured
as the number of nonwork activities undertaken). Estimates of the determinants of the number of
nonwork activities are shown only for variables measuring schooling, age and the age and
numbers of children; but each equation also includes indicators of the day of the week (since
there may be differences across the days in the cost of generating variety). Other controls
11

(discussed in Section III) are also included where available.

Additional schooling has a generally positive partial effect on the number of different
activities undertaken each day. This is true for each transition to a higher education group for
both men and women in the Australian, Israeli, Dutch, American and German samples. Only in
Sweden is there no evidence of any impact of additional schooling on the amount of variety
produced.12 Given the generally positive relation between schooling and market work time,
11

In many cases the vectors of coefficients of the indicators of day of week were statistically significant, but
there was only one regularity in the results across the samples (excluding Israel): In many of the estimates
describing activities more variety was produced on Sunday than on Saturday.
12

This anomalous result is not due to the correlation of age and educational attainment in the Swedish data.
When the equations are reestimated on subsamples divided at age 45 the same results are found. Similarly,
a different definition of the educational categories that also seemed consistent with the classification of
workers into thirds did not alter this conclusion. It is also probably not due to the relatively high level of
aggregation of activities: Aggregating activities in the American data to match the Swedish definitions as
closely as possible (leaving 39 activities in the American data) did not alter the signs or significance of the
impact of educational attainment on the amount of variety generated. One other possibility is simply that
differences in the impact of education on household productivity are less there than elsewhere. While it is
true that the relationship between educational attainment and literacy scores is flatter in Sweden than in the

17

finding an effect of schooling on variety is an extremely strong result, as the more educated
generally have less available nonwork time (as shown in Tables 2) in which to undertake more
variety in their nonwork activities.13 Whether this results from the pure relationship between
schooling and efficiency in household production, or from the correlation between schooling and
the price of time, cannot be inferred from these estimates alone.
One might argue that the results on schooling are an artifact stemming from the ingenuity
of more educated respondents in listing more varied activities in their diaries. We cannot fully
refute this; but if it were true, we would expect to see bigger effects of schooling in those samples
in which more possible nonwork activities might be listed (Australia, the Netherlands and West
Germany). That the marginal effects of moving to a better-educated group are roughly the same
in the Israeli and American samples (where the time diaries provided for many fewer possible
nonwork activities) as in these other three samples suggests the result is not spurious.14
One might also argue that the requirement that an activity lasts at least 15 (or 5) minutes
for it to be recorded causes us to underestimate the amount of variety consumed. Of course it is
true that extremely short-duration activities are not included in the data. There is no reason,
however, for this lacuna to imply that our measure of variety is severely biased downward, as
many such activities are undertaken for longer periods at other times in a day (e.g., a quick
handwashing and a thorough night-time clean-up, a brief glance at the Weather Channel and a
half-hour sitcom, etc.).

Also, there is no reason for their exclusion to affect reporting

United States, this is also true in the Netherlands and Germany (Devroye and Freeman, 2001). A final
possibility is that, because the Swedish earnings distribution is more compressed than in the other
countries, negative wage effects on variety bias downward the estimated impact of education.
13

Unsurprisingly, given that the measure of variety increases only slightly in the Australian data when we
include secondary activities, reestimates of the equations in Tables 4 including secondary activities look
almost identical to those presented in the Tables. Even though measured variety increases somewhat in the
Swedish and substantially in the West German data when secondary activities are included, the impact is
almost entirely on the estimated intercepts. The schooling and other estimated parameters change very
little.
14

Each of the surveys was also extensively pre-tested, in part to ensure that respondents were able to
express their activities consistently. This provides some additional assurance that the questionnaire biases
are small.

18

differentially by level of education. Indeed, if our theory is correct, the underreporting will be
greater among the more educated, since it will be easier for them to produce the extremely shortduration activities that are not recorded. Regardless, observing educational effects of roughly the
same sizes in Australia (and West Germany) and the Netherlands, which have similarly large
numbers of possible activities but different minimum possible time intervals, suggests that these
results are not an artifact of constraints on the minimum duration of recordable activities.
Except for Australian and Dutch women the impact of age on variety is U-shaped,
superficially quite inconsistent with the human capital theory of earnings and with a view that
efficiency increases over much of one’s adult life. A more thorough examination shows that in
most cases the estimates do suggest exactly that kind of increasing effect. In the American,
Israeli and West German samples and among Dutch and Swedish men the amount of variety
produced is increasing over the large majority of the range of ages included in the samples.

15

Having more children in the household increases the number of activities undertaken,
other things equal, in all of the samples analyzed here. For both sexes the presence of pre-school
children adds substantially to the amount of variety produced, while having pre-teen children
adds to it somewhat. Taken together the results suggest, however, that couples whose youngest
child is a teenager produce less variety than do childless couples. While the impact of pre-school
children on variety holds for both mothers and fathers, its magnitude is far larger among mothers.
Children generally, and pre-school and pre-teen children in particular, clearly add to the variety of
activities produced by the household, with most of the additional variety produced by mothers in
childcare activities.
The equations presented in Table 4 do not include the measures of income and/or
earnings that are present in the data sets describing four of the six countries we analyze. They
were excluded because we believe that they are much noisier than the other variables in those

15

Not surprisingly, these estimated impacts and those of schooling are much stronger, especially among
men, if we include the amount of time devoted to market work as an independent variable.

19

regressions and because they are missing for two countries. Nonetheless, it is worth examining
their impacts on the production of variety, as they are part of what is central in our theoretical
motivation. Table 5 lists the estimated coefficients of regressions like those in Tables 4, with the
equations expanded to include the available income and earnings measures. The first thing to
note in these tables is that our inferences from Tables 4 on the impacts of education and age are
qualitatively unchanged when these monetary measures are added to the estimating equations.
In the Australian, Israeli and West German data the estimates demonstrate either that
variety is a superior good, or that there are positive cross-wage effects in the demand for variety.
For all three countries and both sexes more variety is purchased by individuals who are in
households whose other members have higher incomes.

The impacts are not very large.

Doubling other income in the Australian samples leads to increases in the number of activities of
only 1 percent; in the Israeli samples variety increases by 3 percent; and in West Germany variety
increases by less than 1 percent among men, but by 4 percent among women.

In the Swedish

data, the only sample for which we can use a measure of hourly earnings, the generally negative
impacts of hourly earnings suggest that substitution effects predominate in the impact of higher
time prices on the demand for variety.
Another way of considering the relation between education and variety notes that
equation (11) implies that increased efficiency in household production (or additional unearned
income) leads to an expansion at the extensive margin of activities. (A noneconomic prediction
would merely be that education alters people’s tastes, and by expanding their horizons allows
them to undertake more activities that may or may not include those undertaken by less educated
individuals.) We should expect that less educated people will not only engage in fewer activities,
but that their activities will be a subset of those undertaken by individuals with more education.
If it applies perfectly, this “enveloping” property should lead to higher fractions of more educated
people undertaking each activity.

20

Even if the enveloping hypothesis is correct, sampling variation means that we will never
observe higher fractions of the more educated in all activities. We can examine the hypothesis
for all five countries for which the evidence in Tables 3-5 showed that variety rises with
education for both men and women. The fractions of activities in which the more educated group
participates more than the less educated group are shown in Table 6 for both sexes, for each
country, and for each of the three possible two-way comparisons. In all but two of the thirty
comparisons, the two involving highly-educated Australian women, the fraction in which
representation by the more educated group predominates exceeds the ratio AM/[AL +AM], where
AM is the mean number of activities undertaken by members of the more educated group, and AL
is the mean among the less educated group. The evidence thus suggests that the enveloping
hypothesis is correct: More educated people include the activities of the less educated as a proper
subset of the activities that they undertake.
VI. What Kind of Variety?
A. The Duration of Activities
The increase in variety with the number of pre-school children and the U-shaped effect of
age (at least in the case of males) do not create any puzzles, since they closely trace the effects
that these variables have on total nonwork time. The impact of schooling cannot be explained in
the same way, since nonwork time is at most unaffected by schooling and in many cases
diminishes as schooling (and market work time) increases.
The theory predicted that variety will increase with schooling due to two effects: 1)
Increased home productivity allows the more educated to squeeze more activities into the same
amount of time, and higher wages result in relatively lower "time costs" of the more goodsintensive activities for them; and 2) More educated individuals substitute from time-intensive to
goods-intensive activities. As the wage increases, the lower the elasticity of substitution between
time and goods, the greater the increase in the relative price of time-intensive activities. Sleep is

21

the most time-intensive activity, and there is very little chance to substitute goods for time in its
production. It is, therefore, the prime candidate for cuts when wages increase (Biddle and
Hamermesh 1990). Partial support for this hypothesis can be found in the observed pervasive
negative relationship between schooling and time spent on personal care (most of which is sleep)
shown in Table 2 (and in the regression results in the Appendix).
More details are provided by Table 7, which presents the distribution of activities by their
duration (total minutes spent in the activity on a representative day) for men and women, both in
total, and distinguished by educational attainment. The table demonstrates the skewness of the
distribution of activities by duration. About half of the activities (between 45 and 60 percent) last
less than an hour, between 30 and 40 percent last more than an hour but less than 4 hours, and one
activity, almost always sleep, lasts more than 6 hours. The percentage of people who sleep more
than 8 hours on an average day declines with schooling. Similarly, in the 1–4 hour activity group
the number of long activities (2-4 hours) diminishes and the number of short activities (1-2
hours) increases as schooling increases. The time saved allows a 30-40 percent increase in the
number of very short, i.e., less than one hour, activities (with Sweden again the exception).16
B. Routine vs. Nonroutine Activities
The large fraction of time spent by the less educated on the more time-intensive
activities—sleep, rest and TV watching—that have only a very small (variable) goods
component, is indicative of the presence of slack time. The less educated have enough time at
their disposal, but do not possess the material resources that allow them to diversify their set of
activities. The opposite holds for the more educated—they have already conserved on all the
time-intensive activities, and the major constraint on the diversification of their daily activities is
the time constraint. The only way open to them to diversify their activity set is by diversifying

16

A more detailed examination indicates that two other time-intensive activities—rest and TV watching—
are (besides sleep) responsible for the release of time that allows the proliferation of short-duration
activities among the more educated.

22

among days. Thus, if one compares the daily activity sets across days, we should expect a greater
similarity among the less educated than among the more educated.
To test this hypothesis, we compare activity sets between days in those samples where
people reported two days of activities (i.e., all countries except the Netherlands and the U.S.).
Routine activities are defined in the two-day samples as those activities that were undertaken on
both days, and nonroutine activities are those that were undertaken only on one of the two days.
Let NACTW be the number of different activities in which the respondent engaged over the two
reported days:
(12)

min(NACTi) ≤ NACTW ≤ [ΣNACTi] ,

where NACTi is the number of different activities undertaken on day i. We define the number of
routine activities as:
(13a)

ROUTINE = ΣNACTi – NACTW .

The number of nonroutine activities is:
(13b)

NONROUTINE = NACTW – ROUTINE .17
Estimates of the mean numbers of routine and nonroutine activities undertaken in each of

the four samples in total and by level of education are shown in Table 8. In all four, and for both
men and women, the number of nonroutine activities undertaken rises with education. Even for
Swedish men, among whom the total number of activities did not generally rise with education,
most of the anomalies appear to be due to unexpected differences in the number of routine
activities. Variety in routine activities increases with education in the Australian and West
German samples, and among Israeli women, but those increases are much less pronounced than
the increases in nonroutine variety.18
17

Only those Israelis on whom we have exactly two diary-days are included in this analysis.

18

While the Dutch data are not comparable, we can use them analogously by defining:
ROUTINE= {ΣNACTi – NACTW}/6.
Using this definition (for which we thank Roberton Williams), we find that the gradient in routine activities
is flatter with respect to education than that in nonroutine activities. Not only does this result corroborate

23

Tables 9 present estimates of the impacts of schooling, age and the number and ages of
children on the demand for variety in both routine and nonroutine nonwork activity. For each
country the first column shows the estimates for variety in routine activities, and the second lists
results for variety in nonroutine activities. The most striking finding, one that is consistent across
all four samples and for both sexes, is that the impact of schooling on variety is mainly on the
production of variety in nonroutine activities. This was true of the means presented in Table 8,
but the results holding other factors constant are even stronger. Indeed, in the Australian, Israeli
and West German data, where the average numbers of routine and nonroutine activities
undertaken differ little, the impacts of higher educational attainment are roughly twice as large on
variety in nonroutine than in routine activity. Among Swedish women the impact of schooling on
routine variety is negative (with coefficients in excess of their standard errors), while the impact
on nonroutine variety is positive, with the higher two education groups producing significantly
more variety than the lowest. Additional schooling is related to greater household productivity;
but it is along the margin of activities that are not routine—for which the possibility of
technological improvement generated by additional education may be greater—that the
relationship is most noticeable.

19

Detailed regressions focusing on the variability of personal care activities (most of which
are routine) and leisure activities (which have a large nonroutine component) indicate that
increased schooling is associated with an increase in leisure activities but hardly affects the
number of personal care activities. The time conserved in personal care activities (most notably

the evidence in Table 7; it also shows that, when we can examine variety in consumption over a time
interval longer than two days, we still find the same difference in the relationships between education and
routine and nonroutine variety.
19

The equations were reestimated for Australia, Sweden and West Germany to include secondary activities
in the definitions of routine and nonroutine variety. Unsurprisingly, given the small fraction of times for
which Australians coded secondary activities, the results are nearly identical to those presented in Tables 9.
Even in Sweden and West Germany, however, the impact of education on nonroutine variety remained
greater than on routine variety.

24

sleep and rest) is used to increase the diversity of nonroutine leisure activities. As with the role of
education in implementing technical change in product markets (see Welch, 1970, and an
avalanche of recent empirical studies), our results are consistent with the view that education
enables individuals to cope better with nonroutine, but has a much smaller impact on routine
activities.20
C. Weekday vs. Weekend Variety
All of the results presented in Section V and the first part of this Section are based on a
representative day—an amalgam of time diaries from weekdays and weekends. Yet for our
purposes the underlying data are richer than this, since they allow us to examine temporal
variations in variety and how these are affected by differences in human capital. The additional
information provided by regressions here is small, so to save space we present descriptive
statistics only.
Table 10 shows the means and their standard errors of the number of activities
undertaken. The first number in each pair is for the average weekday, the second for the average
weekend day. Except for Australians of both sexes and for Swedish and West German women
there is more variety in nonwork activities on weekends than on weekdays. To a large extent this
is due to the fact that work (in the market especially) leaves less time for variety on weekdays, as
suggested by the much smaller weekday-weekend differences in variety among women than
among men. The striking fact from this table is that the increase in variety with educational
attainment is present on both weekdays and weekends, and indeed is slightly greater on weekends
than on weekdays. If the schooling-variety gradient were due simply to the correlation between
schooling and the value of market time, the relationship would break down on weekends, when
the schooling-value of time relationship is presumably weaker because market work opportunities
are less. That this breakdown does not occur suggests that the schooling-variety link that we have

20

Among both men and women, having additional children generates more variety; but in all four countries
substantially more of the extra variety is in the number of nonroutine activities.

25

demonstrated reflects not only a wage effect on the demand for variety, but also an efficiency
effect as schooling raises people’s ability to overcome setup costs.
As an additional step we examine the schooling-variety result in more detail by
comparing differences in the gradient between people whose two days of time diaries cover one
weekend day and one weekday and the other respondents, both of whose diaries are on weekend
days or weekdays only. If schooling is productive we should expect to observe a sharper gradient
of variety in nonroutine activities among respondents in the former group, since more educated
people will be better able to take advantage of the absence of constraints on their time on
weekends to generate more different activities. We are thus essentially estimating the double
difference:
(14)

∆2 = [δNONROUTINE/δEducation]Day-Day,End-End - [δNONROUTINE/δEducation]Day-End ,

in the impact of schooling on variety—comparing across the two diary-days and across the two
categories of respondent. If education affects variety causally, we will observe ∆2 < 0.
We can reestimate the models in Table 9 describing nonroutine variety only for Australia
and West Germany, as these are the only countries where the sampling procedure generates
enough observations with diaries on both weekends and weekdays.

Using the coefficient

estimates on the indicators of educational attainment, we estimate ∆2 = 1.34 – 2.18 = -0.83, and
∆2 = 0.97 – 1.60 = -0.63 for men in Australia and West Germany respectively. Among women
the estimates are ∆2 = 1.02 – 1.28 = -0.26, ∆2 = 1.09 – 1.26 = -0.17 in the two countries
respectively. For both sexes and both countries the schooling-nonroutine gradient is steeper when
we observe people on whom time constraints differ across the two days sampled. That more
educated workers have more flexibility in their work time, so that a pair of weekdays that might
seem to be equally restrictive is less constraining for them, means that, if anything, the estimates
of ∆2 have a positive bias, so that the true double differences are even more negative.

26

VII.

Conclusions and Implications
We have constructed a model of household production focusing on variety in the

household members’ undertakings. Driving the model are differences among households in the
ability to overcome the setup costs that occur when time (and perhaps monetary) resources must
be devoted to adding a new activity to the set of activities undertaken in the day or week. We
postulate that those differences are linked to schooling and its positive relationship to the
efficiency of the household’s production technology.

Using time-budget surveys from six

countries we have demonstrated that this is exactly what occurs: Individuals with more education
undertake more different activities in a day. Moreover, these differences stem mostly from the
ability of more educated people to generate a greater variety of those activities, which we call
nonroutine, that are not repeated every day. One can also infer from our model that incomes and
the price of time will affect the amount of variety undertaken. We do observe positive pure
income (or cross-wage) effects in the three countries for which we have data, and for the only
country on which we have wage data there is weak evidence that substitution effects dominate.
One can interpret the variety-schooling relationship as causal, although the evidence on
the relationship between education and the total variety of activities might by itself also be
construed as reflecting underlying heterogeneity among individuals and households. That we
observe different relationships between education and routine versus nonroutine variety and
similar variety-schooling gradients on weekdays and weekends are harder to explain by
underlying heterogeneity, but reasonable explanations might possibly also be constructed on that
basis.
Education produces a remarkable variety of benefits, from direct effects on earnings
(Becker, 1964), to externalities that it creates in production and the spillover to economic growth
(e.g., Romer, 1986), to impacts on noneconomic outcomes such as criminal activity and others
(e.g., Grogger, 1998). We have suggested here that education generates yet another welfareenhancing outcome—additional variety in the activities in which people engage. We cannot

27

measure the magnitude of the gain in welfare that is generated by the greater diversity in activities
that comes with education.21 All that can be concluded at this point is that there are gains along
this dimension, with the effect of education on variety not small: Except for Sweden the
estimates suggest that each extra year of schooling yields around a 2 percent increase in variety.
Having demonstrated that there are systematic differences among households in the
production of variety, one wonders how this realization might affect the theory of product
demand. The first thing to do here is to analyze whether greater variety in time use is associated
with greater variety in the kinds of goods used in household production. Even without that
analysis, however, these results suggest that, as its citizens acquire more skills, an economy will
generate a greater demand for variety in the activities that its consumers undertake and will
provide incentives for greater differentiation of the products that its firms offer.

This

development will in turn affect the structure of product markets.

21

The issue is somewhat similar to that of valuing new goods (see Hausman, 1997), although the welfare
effects of increased variety are generated endogenously rather than by a presumably exogenous product
innovation.
