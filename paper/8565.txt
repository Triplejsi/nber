Trading Volume: Implications of An Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model

NBER Working Paper No. 8565
October 2001
JEL No. G12, G11, G14

ABSTRACT
We derive an intertemporal capital asset pricing model with multiple assets and heterogeneous
investors, and explore its implications for the behavior of trading volume and asset returns. Assets contain
two types of risks: market risk and the risk of changing market conditions. We show that investors trade
only in two portfolios: the market portfolio, and a hedging portfolio, which allows them to hedge the
dynamic risk. This implies that trading volume of individual assets exhibit a two-factor structure, and
their factor loadings depend on their weights in the hedging portfolio. This allows us to empirically
identify the hedging portfolio using volume data. We then test the two properties of the hedging portfolio:
its return provides the best predictor of future market returns and its return together with the return of the
market portfolio are the two risk factors determining the cross-section of asset returns.

Introduction

Fundamental shocks to the economy drive both the supply and demand of ﬁnancial assets
and their prices. Thus, any asset-pricing model that attempts to establish a structural
link between asset prices and underlying economic factors also establishes links between
prices and quantities such as trading volume. In fact, asset-pricing models link the the
joint behavior of prices and quantities with economic fundamentals such as the preferences
of investors and the future payoﬀs of the assets. Therefore, the construction and empirical
implementation of any asset-pricing model should involve both price and quantities as its key
elements. Even from a purely empirical perspective, the joint behavior of price and quantities
reveals more information about the relation between asset prices and economic factors than
prices alone. Yet the asset-pricing literature has centered more on prices and much less on
quantities. For example, empirical investigations of well-known asset-pricing models such as
the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and its intertemporal extensions (ICAPM) have
focused exclusively on prices and returns, completely ignoring the information contained in
quantities. In this paper, we hope to show that even if our main interest is in the behavior
of prices, valuable information about price dynamics can be gleaned from trading volume.
We begin by developing an intertemporal capital asset pricing model of multiple assets
in the spirit of Merton’s ICAPM. We explicitly model investors’ asset demands and derive
equilibrium asset prices and asset holdings. In our model, assets are exposed to two sources
of risks: market risk and the risk of changes in market conditions.1 As a result, investors
wish to hold two distinct portfolios of risky assets: the market portfolio and a hedging
portfolio. The market portfolio allows them to adjust their exposure to market risk, and the
hedging portfolio allows them hedge the risk of changes in market conditions. In equilibrium,
investors trade in only these two portfolios, and expected asset returns are determined by
their exposure to these two risks, i.e., a two-factor linear pricing model holds, where the two
factors are the returns on the market portfolio and the hedging portfolio, respectively.
We then explore the implications of this model on the joint behavior of volume and
returns. Since investors hold only two portfolios—the market portfolio and the hedging

portfolio—they trade in only these portfolios. This implies that trading volume also exhibits
a two-factor structure: the ﬁrst factor arises from their trades in the market portfolio and
the second factor arises from their trades in the hedging portfolio. More importantly, we
show that the factor loading of each asset’s trading volume on the hedging-portfolio factor is
identical to that asset’s portfolio weight in the hedging portfolio. This remarkable property
of the trading volume of individual assets suggests a way to identify the hedging portfolio
from a rather unexpected source: volume data. Moreover, after arriving at such a portfolio,
we have the means to verify that it is indeed the hedging portfolio: its returns should be the
best predictor of future returns on the market portfolio. Collectively, these results provide
concrete economic foundations for determining risk factors beyond the market portfolio for
dynamic equilibrium asset-pricing models.
Using the weekly returns and volume data on NYSE and AMEX stocks from 1962 to
1996, we implement the model empirically. From the trading volume of individual stocks,
we construct the hedging portfolio and its returns. We ﬁnd that the hedging-portfolio returns
consistently outperforms other factors in predicting future returns to the market portfolio.
We then use the returns to the hedging and market portfolios as two risk factors in a crosssectional test along the lines of Fama and MacBeth (1973), and ﬁnd that the hedging portfolio
is comparable to other factors in explaining the cross-sectional variation of expected returns.
In Section 2, we present our intertemporal equilibrium model of asset-pricing and trading
volume. In Section 3, we explore the model’s implications for volume and returns. Section
4 describes the data used in our empirical implementation of the model, and outlines the
construction of the hedging portfolio. In Section 5, we compare the forecast power of the
hedging portfolio with other factors, and we perform cross-sectional tests of the hedging
portfolio as a risk factor in Section 6. We conclude in Secton 7.

The Model

In this section, we develop an intertemporal equilibrium model of stock trading and pricing
with multiple assets and heterogeneous investors. Since our purpose is to draw its qualitative
implications on the joint behavior of return and volume, the model is kept as parsimonious
as possible. Several generalizations of the model are discussed in Section 2.2.

2.1

The Economy

We consider an economy deﬁned on a set of discrete dates: t = 0, 1, 2, . . .. There are J risky
assets in the economy, which we call stocks. Each stock pays a stream of dividends over time.
Let Djt denote the dividend of stock j at date t, j = 1, · · · , J, and Dt ≡ (D1t ; · · · ; DJt )
denote the column vector of dividends.2 Without loss of generality, in this section we assume
that the total number of shares outstanding is one for each stock.
A stock portfolio can be expressed in terms of its shares of each stock, denoted by
S ≡ (S1 ; . . . ; SJ ), where Sj is the number of stock j shares in the portfolio (j = 1, . . . , J). A
portfolio of particular importance is the market portfolio, denoted by SM , which is given by
SM = ι

(1)

where ι is a vector of 1’s with rank J. DM t ≡ ι Dt gives the dividend of the market portfolio,
which is the aggregate dividend.
In addition to the stocks, there is also a risk-free bond that yields a constant, positive
interest r per time period.
There are I investors in the economy. Each investor is endowed with equal shares of the
stocks and no bond. Every period, investor i, i = 1, . . . , I, maximizes his expected utility of
the following form:

where Wt+1
is investor i’s wealth next period, Xt , Yti , Zti are three one-dimensional state

variables, and λX , λY , λZ are non-negative constants. Apparently, the utility function in (2)
is state-dependent. We further assume

are IID over time with zero means. For tractability, we further assume that Dt and Xt are

Discussion

Our model has several features that might seem unusual. Most importantly, investors are
assumed to have a myopic, but state-dependent utility function in (2). The purpose for using
this utility function is to capture the dynamic nature of the investment problem without explicitly solving a dynamic optimization problem. This utility function should be interpreted
as the equivalent of a value function from an appropriately speciﬁed dynamic optimization
problem (see, for example, Wang, 1994 and Lo and Wang, 2000b). In an earlier draft of the
paper, we did specify a canonical dynamic optimization problem for the investors, in which
they have state-independent utility over their lifetime consumption. It was shown that the
resulting value function, as a function of wealth and the state variables, has the form as the
state-dependent utility function in (2). For simplicity in exposition, we directly start with
(2).
The state dependence of the utility function has the following properties. The marginal
utility of wealth depends on the dividend of the market portfolio (the aggregate dividend),
as reﬂected in the second term in the exponential of the utility function. When the aggregate
dividend goes up, the marginal utility of wealth goes down. There are many ways to motivate
this type of utility function. For example, the utility can be derived from wealth in reference
to the market, not the level of wealth itself (see, for example, Abel, 1990, and Campbell
and Cochrane, 1999). Alternatively, if in addition to their stock investments, investors are
also exposed to other risks that are correlated to the market (see, for example, Wang, 1994).
The marginal utility of wealth also depends on future state variables, in particular Xt+1 , as
reﬂected in the third term in the exponential of the utility function. The motivation for allowing such a dependence is as follows. Since the state variables determine the stock returns
in equilibrium, the value function (indirect utility function) of an investor who optimizes
dynamically would depend on these state variables. Without modelling the dynamic opti-

4

mization problem explicitly, we explicitly impose such a dependence on the (myopic) utility
function. This dependence introduces dynamic hedging motives in the investors’ portfolio
choices (see Merton, 1971, for a discussion on dynamic hedging).
Another simpliﬁcation in the model is the IID assumption for the state variables. This
might leave the impression that the model is eﬀectively static. This impression, however, is
false since the state-dependence of investors’ utility function introduces important dynamics
over time. We can allow richer dynamics for the state variables without changing the main
properties of the model.
The particular form of the utility function and the normality of distribution for the state
variables are assumed for tractability. These assumptions are restrictive. But we hope with
some conﬁdence that the qualitative predictions of the model that we explore in this paper
are not sensitive to these assumptions.
In the model, we also assumed an exogenous interest rate for the bond without requiring
the bond market to clear. This is a modelling choice we have made in order to simplify
our analysis and to focus on the stock market. As will become clear later, changes in the
interest rate is not important for the issues we examine in this paper. From an empirical
point of view, at the frequency we are interested in (weekly), changes in interest rate are
usually small.

Let Pt ≡ (P1t ; . . . ; PJt ) and Sti ≡ (S1t

) be the (column) vectors of (ex-dividend)

stock prices and investor i’s stock holdings respectively. We now derive the equilibrium of
the economy.
Deﬁnition 1 An equilibrium is given by a price process {Pt : t = 0, 1, . . .} and the investors
stock positions {Sti : i = 1, . . . , I; t = 0, 1, . . .} such that:

Sti = ι.

(6)

i=1

The above deﬁnition of equilibrium is standard, except that the bond market does not clear
here. As discussed earlier, the interest rate is given exogenously and there is an elastic supply
of bonds at that rate.
For t = 0, 1, . . ., let Qt+1 denote the vector of excess dollar returns on the stocks:
Qt+1 ≡ Dt+1 + Pt+1 − (1+r)Pt .

(7)

Thus, Qjt+1 = Djt+1 + Pjt+1 − (1 + r)Pjt gives the dollar return on one share of stock j
in excess of its ﬁnancing cost for period t + 1. For the remainder of the paper, we simply
refer to Qjt+1 as the dollar return of stock j, omitting the qualiﬁer “excess”. Dollar return
Qjt+1 diﬀers from the conventional (excess) return measure Rjt+1 which is the dollar return
normalized by the share price: Rjt+1 ≡ Qjt+1 /Pjt . We refer to Rjt+1 simply as the return on
stock j in period t + 1.
We can now state the solution to the equilibrium in the following theorem:

Pt = −a − bXt

The nature of the equilibrium is intuitive. In our model, an investor’s utility function
depends not only on his wealth, but also on the stock payoﬀs directly. In other words, even
he holds no stocks, his utility ﬂuctuates with the payoﬀ of the stocks. Such a “market spirit”
aﬀects his demand for the stocks, in addition to the usual factors such as the stocks’ expected
returns. The market spirit of investor i is measured by (λX Xt + λY Yti ). When (λX Xt + λZ Yti )
is positive, investor i extracts positive utility when the aggregate stock payoﬀ is high. Such
a positive “attachment” to the market makes holding stocks less attractive to him. When
(λX Xt + λY Yti ) is negative, he has a negative attachment to the market, which makes holding
stocks more attractive. Such a market spirit at the aggregate level, which is captured by
Xt , aﬀects the aggregate stock demand, which in turn aﬀects their equilibrium prices. Given
the particular form of the utility function, Xt aﬀects the equilibrium stock prices linearly.
The idiosyncratic diﬀerences among investors in their market spirit, which are captured by
Yti , oﬀset each other at the aggregate level, thus do not aﬀect the equilibrium stock prices.
However, they do aﬀect individual investors’ stock holdings. As the ﬁrst term of (9) shows,
investors with positive Yti ’s hold less stocks (they are already happy by just “watching” the
stocks paying oﬀ).
Since the aggregate utility variable Xt is driving the stock prices, it is also driving the
stock returns. In fact, the expected returns on the stocks are changing with Xt (see the discussion in the next section). The form of the utility function further states that the investors
utility function directly depends on Xt , which fully characterizes the market conditions investors face, in particular, the investment opportunities. Such a dependence endogenously
arises when investors optimize dynamically. In our setting, however, we assume that investors optimize myopically but insert such a dependence directly into the utility function.
This dependence induces investors to care about future market conditions when choose their
portfolios. In particular, they prefer those portfolios whose returns can help them to smooth
ﬂuctuations in their utility due to changes in market conditions. Such a preference gives rise
to the hedging component in their asset demand, which is captured by the second term in
(9).

The Behavior of Returns and Volume

Given the intertemporal CAPM deﬁned above, we can derive its implications on the behavior
of return and volume. For the stocks, their dollar return vector can be re-expressed as follows:
Qt+1 = ra + (1+r) bXt + Q̃t+1

(10)

where Q̃t+1 ≡ Dt+1 − bZt+1 denotes the vector of unexpected dollar returns on the stocks,
which are IID over time with zero mean. Equation (10) shows that the expected returns on
the stocks change over time. In particular, they are driven by a single state variable Xt .
The investors stock holdings can be expressed in the following form:
Sti = hiM t ι + hiH t SH

∀ i = 1, 2, . . . , I

(11)

where hiM t ≡ I −1 − λY Yti , hiH t ≡ λY (b ι)Yti − λZ Zti , and
SH ≡ (σQQ )−1 σQX .

(12)

Equation (11) simply states that two-fund separation holds for the investors’ stock investments. That is, the stock investments of all investors can be viewed as investments in two
common funds: the market portfolio ι and the hedging portfolio SH .3 In our current model,
these two portfolios, expressed in terms of stock shares, are constant over time.
The particular structure of the returns and the investors’ portfolios lead to several interesting predictions about the behavior of volume and returns. We present these predictions
through a set of propositions.

3.1

The Cross Section of Volume

Given the heterogeneity in their preferences which change over time, investors trade among
themselves to achieve their optimal stock holdings. The volume of trade can be measure by
the turnover ratio. Since we have normalized the total number of shares outstanding to be
3

The investors’ total portfolios satisfy three-fund monetary separation: the risk-free bond and the two
stock funds. For our discussion here, we restrict our attention to their stock investments and always focus
on the two stock funds.

hM t − hiM t−1 + hiH t − hiH t−1 SH j
τjt ≡
2 i=1

∀ j = 1, . . . , J.

(13)

Let τt denote the vector of turnover for all stocks. We have the following proposition on
the cross-section of volume:
Proposition 1 When investors’ trading in the hedging portfolio is small relative to their
trading in the market portfolio, the two-fund separation in their stock holdings leads to an
approximate two-factor structure for stock turnover:
τt ≈ ιFM t + SH FH t

and FH t =

In the special case when one-fund separation holds for stock holdings (when Xt = 0 ∀ t),
turnover would have an exact one-factor structure, τt = ιFM t . Moreover, the loading of
individual turnover on the common factor is identical. In other words, the turnover is
identical cross all stocks. This is not surprising. In the case of one-fund separation for stock
investments, investors trade in one stock portfolio, which has to be the market portfolio.
Thus, they trade all the stocks in same proportions (in shares). Consequently, the turnover
must be the same for all stocks.4
In the general case when two-fund separation holds for stock investments, turnover has an
approximate two-factor structure as given in (14). It is important to note that the loading of
stock j’s turnover on the second factor is proportional to its share weight in the hedging portfolio. Thus, empirically if we can identify the two common factors, FM t and FH t , the stocks’
loadings on the second factor allow us to identify the hedging portfolio. In our empirical
analysis, we explore this information that the cross-section of volume conveys. As we discuss
below, the hedging portfolio has important properties that allow us to better understand the
behavior of returns. Merton (1971) has discussed the properties of hedging portfolios in a

continuous-time framework as a characterization of equilibrium. Our discussion here follows
Merton in spirit, but is in a discrete-time, equilibrium environment.

3.2

Time Series Implications for the Hedging Portfolio

By the deﬁnition of the hedging portfolio in (12), it is easy to show that its current return
gives the best forecast of future market return.
Let QM t+1 denote the dollar return on the market portfolio in period t + 1 and QH t+1
denote the dollar return on the hedging portfolio. Then,
QM t+1 = ι Qt+1

and QH t+1 = SH Qt+1 .

(15)

For an arbitrary portfolio S, its dollar return in period t, which is Qt ≡ S  Qt , can serve as
a predictor for the dollar of the market next period:
QM t+1 = δ0 + δ1 Qt + εM t+1 .
The predictive power of S is measured by the R2 of the above regression. We can solve for
the portfolio that maximizes the R2 . The solution, up to a scaling constant, is the hedging
portfolio. Thus, we have the following result:
Proposition 2 Among the returns of all portfolios, the dollar return of the hedging portfolio,
SH , provides the best forecast for the future dollar return of the market.
In other words, if we regress the market dollar return on the lagged dollar return of any
portfolios, the hedging portfolio gives the highest R2 .

3.3

Cross-Sectional Implications for the Hedging Portfolio

We now turn to examine the predictions of our model on the cross-section of returns. For
expositional simplicity, we introduce some additional notation. Let Qpt+1 be the dollar return
of a stock or a portfolio (of stocks). Q̃pt+1 ≡ Qpt+1 − Et [Qpt+1 ] then denotes its unexpected
dollar return and Q̄p its unconditional mean. Thus, Q̃M t+1 and Q̃H t+1 denote, respectively,
the unexpected dollar returns on the market portfolio and the hedging portfolio, and

2

σM

σH2 = σXQ (σQQ )−1 σQX ,

σM H = ι σQX

where σQQ and σQX are given in Theorem 1. From Theorem 1, we have
Q̄ = ᾱσQQ ι + λZ σQX

(16a)

2
Q̄M = ᾱσM
+ λZ σM H

(16b)

Q̄H = ᾱσM H + λZ σH2 .

(16c)

Equation (16) characterizes the cross-sectional variation in the stocks’ expected dollar returns.
In order to develop more intuition about (16), we ﬁrst consider the special case when
Xt = 0 ∀ t. In this case, returns are IID over time. The risk of a stock is measured by its
co-variability with the market portfolio. We have the following result:
Proposition 3 When Xt = 0 ∀ t, we have


E Q̃t+1 |Q̃M t+1 = βM Q̃M t+1

(17)

where

βM ≡ Cov Q̃t+1 , Q̃M t+1


Var Q̃M t+1 = σDD ι (ι σDD ι)

is the vector of the stocks’ market betas. Moreover,
Q̄ = βM Q̄M

(18)

2
≥ 0.
where Q̄M = ᾱσM

Obviously in this case, the CAPM holds for the dollar returns. It can be shown that it also
holds for the returns.
In the general case when Xt changes over time, there is an additional risk due to changing
market conditions (dynamic risk). Moreover, this risk is represented by the dollar return of
the hedging portfolio, which is denoted by QH t ≡ SH Qt . In this case, the risk of a stock is
measured by its risk with respect to the market portfolio and its risk with respect to the
11

hedging portfolio. In other words, there are two risk factors, the (contemporaneous) market
risk and the (dynamic) risk of changing market conditions. The expected returns of the
stocks are then determined by their exposures to these two risks and the associated risk
premia. The result is summarized in the following proposition:
Proposition 4 When Xt changes over time, we have


E Q̃t+1 |Q̃M t+1 , Q̃H t+1 = βM Q̃M t+1 + βH Q̃H t+1

is the vector of the stocks’ market betas and hedging betas. Moreover, The stocks’ expected
dollar returns satisfy
Q̄ = βM Q̄M + βH Q̄H

(20)

2
where Q̄M = ᾱσM
+ λZ σM H and Q̄H = ᾱσM H + λZ σH2 .

Thus, a stock’s risk is measured by its beta with respect to the market portfolio and its beta
with respect to the hedging portfolio. The expected dollar return on the market portfolio
gives the premium of the market risk and the expected dollar return on the hedging portfolio
gives the premium of the dynamic risk. (20) simply states that the premium on a stock is
then given by the sum of the product of its exposure to each risk and the associated premium.
Under constant market conditions (Xt = 0,

∀ t), the premium for the market risk,

Q̄, is always positive. However, under changing market conditions, the premium for the
market risk need not always be positive. In particular, when σM H is signiﬁcantly negative
(λZ is assumed to be positive), Q̄ can become negative. This is simply because that the
premium is determined by the covariance between the market return and investors’ marginal
utility, which depends on both their wealth and the other state variables. The positive
covariance between the market return and investors’ wealth gives a positive premium to
the market portfolio. But the negative covariance between the market return and the state
12

variable Xt that drives the utility function gives a negative premium. The total premium on
the market portfolio is the sum of these two components, which can be negative when the
second component dominates.
The pricing relation we obtain in Proposition 4 is in the spirit of Merton’s Intertemporal
CAPM in a continuous-time framework (Merton, 1971). However, it is important to note
that Merton’s result is a characterization of the pricing relation under a (class of) proposed
price processes and no equilibrium is provided to support these price processes. In contrast,
our pricing relation is derived from a dynamic equilibrium model. In this sense, we model
provides an particular equilibrium model for which Merton’s characterization holds.
If we can identify the hedging portfolio empirically, its return provides the second risk
factor. Diﬀerences in the stocks’ expected returns can then be fully explained by their
exposures to the two risks (market risk and dynamic risk), as measured by their market
betas and hedging betas.

An Empirical Implementation

Our empirical analysis of the implications of the model outlined in Sections 2 and 3 is
comprised of three parts. In the ﬁrst part, we exploit the model’s cross-sectional implications
to construct the hedging portfolio from volume data. In the second part, we examine the
ability of the hedging portfolio to forecast future market-portfolio returns. And in the third
part, we investigate the role of the hedging-portfolio return as a risk factor in explaining the
cross-sectional variation of expected returns. We focus on the ﬁrst part in this section, and
consider the second and third parts in Sections 5 and 6.

4.1

The Data

We use an extract of the CRSP Daily Master File called the “MiniCRSP Returns and
Turnover” database described in Lo and Wang (2000a). This extract consists of weekly
return and turnover series for individual stocks traded on NYSE and AMEX from July
1962 to December 1996 (1800 weeks). We choose weekly holding periods as a compromise
between maximizing the sample size and minimizing the impact of high-frequency return
and turnover ﬂuctuations that are likely to be of less direct economic consequence. We also

13

limit our focus to ordinary common shares (CRSP sharecodes 10 and 11 only).
As documented in Lo and Wang (2000a) and in many other studies, aggregate turnover
seems to be nonstationary, exhibiting a signiﬁcant time trend and time-varying volatilities.
For example, the average weekly turnover in the period from 1962 to 1966 is 0.57%, but grows
to 1.31% in the period from 1992 to 1996, and the volatilities during these two periods were
0.07% and to 0.23%, respectively. Detrending has been advocated by several other authors
(e.g., Andersen, 1996 and Gallant, Rossi, and Tauchen 1992), and there is no doubt that such
procedures may help to induce more desirable time series properties for turnover. However,
Lo and Wang (2000a) show that the diﬀerent types of detrending methods, e.g., linear,
logarithmic, or quadratic, yield detrended time series with markedly diﬀerent statistical
properties. Since we do not have any speciﬁc priors or theoretical justiﬁcation for the kinds
of nonstationarities in aggregate turnover, we use the raw data in our empirical analysis.
To address the issue of nonstationarities, we conduct our empirical analysis on ﬁve-year
subperiods only.5 For notational convenience, we shall sometimes refer to these subperiods
by the following numbering scheme:

Construction of the Hedging Portfolio

Our ﬁrst step in empirically implementing the intertemporal model of Sections 2 and 3 is
to construct the hedging portfolio from turnover data. From (14), we know that in the
two-factor model for turnover in Proposition 1, stock j’s loading on the second factor FH t
yields the number of shares (as a fraction of its total number of shares outstanding) of stock
j in the hedging portfolio. In principle, this identiﬁes the hedging portfolio. However, we
face two challenges in practice. First, the exact two-factor speciﬁcation (14) is, at best, an
5

Obviously, from a purely statistical perspective, using shorter subperiods does not render a nonstationary
time series stationary. However, if the sources of nonstationarity are institutional changes and shifts in general
business conditions, conﬁning our attention to shorter timespans does improve the quality of statistical
inference. See Lo and Wang (2000a) for further discussion.

14

approximation for the true data-generating process of turnover. Second, the two common
factors are generally not observable. We address both of these problems in turn.
A more realistic starting point for modelling turnover is an approximate two-factor model:
τjt = FM t + θH j FH t + εjt ,

j = 1, . . . , J

(21)

where FM t and FH t are the two factors that generate trading in the market portfolio and
the hedging portfolio, respectively, θH j is the percentage of shares of stock j in the hedging
portfolio (as a percentage of its total number of shares outstanding), and εjt is the error
term, which is assumed to be independent across stocks.
Cross-sectional independence of the errors is a restrictive assumption. If, for example,
there are other common factors in addition to FM t and FH t , then εjt is likely to be correlated
across stocks. The appropriateness of the independence assumption is an empirical matter,
and in Lo and Wang (2000a), we have found evidence supporting the two- factor structure.
In particular, the covariance matrices of turnover for a collection of turnover-beta-sorted
portfolios generally exhibit two large eigenvalues that dominate the rest. This provides
limited justiﬁcation for assuming that εjt is independent across stocks.
Since we do not have any suﬃcient theoretical foundation to identify the two common
factors FM t and FH t , we use two turnover indexes as their proxies: the equally-weighted and
share-weighted turnover of the market. Speciﬁcally. let Nj denote the total number of shares

outstanding for stock j and N ≡ j Nj the total number of shares outstanding of all stocks.
The two turnover indexes are

error terms for the two indexes.6 Since the error terms in (21) are assumed to be independent
across stocks, the error terms of the two indexes, which are weighted averages of the error
terms of individual stocks, become negligible when the number of stocks is large. For the
remainder of our analysis, we shall ignore them.
Simple algebra then yields the following relation between individual turnover and the
two indexes:
SW

τjt = βτSW

βτEW
j + βτ j = 1 ∀ j

(24a)

(24b)

These relations should come as no surprise since the two-factor speciﬁcation for turnover,
(21), has only J parameters {θH j }, whereas the transformed two-factor model (23) has
SW
two sets of parameters, {βτEW
j } and {βτ j }. The ﬁrst relation, (24a), exactly reﬂects the

dependence between the parameters and the second relation, (24b), comes from the fact
that the coeﬃcients in (23) are independent of the scale of {θH j }.

Using the MiniCRSP volume database, we can empirically estimate {βτEW

(26)

However, there are two remaining parameters, nEW and nSW , that need to be estimated.
It should be emphasized that these two remaining degrees of freedom are inherent in the
model (21). When the two common factors are not observed, the parameters {θH j} are only
identiﬁed up to a scaling constant and a rotation. Clearly, (21) is invariant when FH t is
rescaled as long as {θH j } is also rescaled appropriately. In addition, when the two factors
are replaced by their linear combinations, (21) remains formally the same as long as {θH j }
is also adjusted with an additive constant.7 Since the hedging portfolio {θH j } is deﬁned only
up to a scaling constant, we let
nSW = 1

(27a)

nEW − nSW = φ

(27b)

where φ is a parameter that we calibrate to the data (see Section 5). This yields the ﬁnal
expression for the J components of the hedging portfolio:
θH j = φ βτEW
j + 1.

(28)

The normalization nSW = 1 sets the total number of shares in the portfolio to a positive value.
If φ = 0, the portfolio has equal percentage of all the shares of each company, implying that
it is the market portfolio. Nonzero values of φ represent deviations from the market portfolio.
SW
To estimate {βτEW
j } and {βτ j }, we ﬁrst construct the two turnover indexes. Figure 1 plots

their time series over the entire sample period from 1962 to 1996. We estimate (25a)–(25b)
for each of the seven ﬁve-year subperiods, ignoring the global constraint (25c).8 Therefore,
we estimate constrained linear regressions of the weekly turnover for each stock on equal7

For example, for any a, we have ∀ j:
τjt = FM t + θH j FH t + εjt = (FM t + aFH t ) + (θH j − a)FH t + εjt = F̃M t + θ̃H j FH t + εjt

where F̃M t = FM t + aFH t and θ̃H j = θH j − a.
8
We ignore this constraint for two reasons. First, given the large number of stocks in our sample, imposing
a global constraint like (25c) requires a large amount of computer memory, which was unavailable to us.
Second, because of the large number of individual regressions involved, neglecting the reduction of one
dimension should not signiﬁcantly aﬀect any of the ﬁnal results.

17

and share-weighted turnover indexes in each of the seven ﬁve-year subperiods of our sample.
Figure 2 plots the histogram of {βEW } for each of the subperiods. There is clearly a wide
τj

distribution of estimated coeﬃcients, ranging from −2 to 10 in the ﬁrst four subperiods and
−10 to 10 in the last three. Outliers in the raw turnover data are often the source of these
large estimates (see Lo and Wang, 2000a, for a more detailed discussion of outliers).
Table 1 reports summary statistics for these constrained regressions. To provide a clearer
sense of the dispersion of these regressions, we ﬁrst sort them into deciles based on {βEW },
τj

and then compute the means and standard deviations of the estimated coeﬃcients {βτEW
j }
2
and {βτSW
j }, their t-statistics, and the R̄ s within each decile. The t-statistics indicate that
the estimated coeﬃcients are generally signiﬁcant—even in the ﬁfth and sixth deciles, the
average t-statistic for {βτEW
j } is 4.585 and 6.749, respectively (we would, of course, expect
signiﬁcant t-statistics in the extreme deciles even if the true coeﬃcients were zero, purely
from sampling variation). The R̄2 s also look impressive, however, they must be interpreted
with some caution because of the imposition of the constraint (25b), which can yield R̄2
greater than unity and less than zero.9 Table 1 shows that negative R̄2 s appear mainly
in the two extreme deciles, except in the last subperiod when they are negative for all the
deciles, presumably an indication that the constraint is not consistent with the data in this
last subperiod.
For comparison, we estimate the unconstrained version of (25a) and compute the same
summary statistics, reported in Table 2. Table 2 also reports the mean and standard deviation within each decile of p-values corresponding to the statistic that (25b) holds. Except
for the last subperiod, the constraint seems to be reasonably consistent with the data, with
average p-values well above 5% for all but the extreme deciles in most subperiod. For example, in the ﬁrst subperiod, the average p-values range from a minimum of 4.0% in decile 1
to a maximum of 32.4% in decile 6, and with a value of 19.4% in decile 10. However, in the
last subperiod, the average p-value is less than 5% deciles 2–6, and close to signiﬁcance for
most of the other deciles, which explains the negative R̄2 s in Table 1.
Without the constraint, the R̄2 s in Table 2 are well behaved, and of similar magnitude
to those in Table1 that are between 0% and 100%, ranging from 40% to 60%, even in the
EW
SW
For example, a negative R̄2 arises when the variance of βτEW
+ βτSW
exceeds the variance of the

dependent variable τjt , which can happen when the constraint (25b) is imposed.

of variation in the weekly turnover of individual stocks.

The Forecast Power of the Hedging Portfolio

Having constructed the hedging portfolio up to a parameter φ to be determined, we can
examine its time-series properties as predicted by the model of Sections 2 and 3. In particular,
in this section we focus on the degree to which the the hedging portfolio can predict future
stock returns, especially the return on the market portfolio. We ﬁrst construct the returns
of the hedging portfolio in Section 5.1 by calibrating φ, and then compare its forecast power
with other factors in Sections 5.2 and 5.3.

5.1

Hedging-Portfolio Returns

To construct the return on the hedging portfolio, we begin by calculating its dollar value
and dollar returns. Let k denote subperiod k, k = 2, . . . , 7, Vjt (k) denote the total market
capitalization of stock j at time period t (the end of week t) in subperiod k, Qjt (k) denote its dividend-adjusted excess dollar return for the same period, and Rjt (k) denote the
dividend-adjusted excess return, and θj (k) the estimated share (as fraction of its total shares
outstanding) in the hedging portfolio in subperiod k.
For stock j to be included in the hedging portfolio in subperiod k, which we shall refer to
as the “testing period”, we require it to have volume data for at least one third of the sample
in the previous subperiod (k−1), which we call the “estimation period”. Among the stocks
satisfying this criteria, we eliminate those ranked in the top and bottom 0.5% according to
their volume betas (or their share weights in the hedging portfolio) to limit the potential
impact of outliers.10 We let Jt (k) denote the set of stocks that survive these two ﬁlters and
that have price and return data for week t of subperiod k. The hedging portfolio in week t
of sub-period k is then given by:

 θH j ,
j ∈ Jt (k)
θH jt (k) =

0,
j∈
/ Jt (k)
10

(29)

See Lo and Wang (2000a) for the importance of outliers in volume data.

19

The dollar return of the hedging portfolio for week t follows naturally:
QH t (k) ≡



θH jt (k)Vjt Rjt .

(30)

j

and the (rate of) return of the hedging portfolio is given by
RH t (k) ≡

QH jt (k)
VH t (k)

(31)

where
VH t (k) ≡



θH jt (k)Vjt−1

(32)

j

is the value of the hedging portfolio at the beginning of the week.
The procedure outlined above yields the return and the dollar return of the hedging
portfolio up to the parameter φ, which must be calibrated. To do so, we exploit a key
property of the hedging portfolio: its return is the best forecaster of future market returns
(see Section 3). Therefore, for a given value of φ, we can estimate the following regression
RM t+1 = δ0 + δ1 {RH t or QH t } + εM t+1

(33)

where the single regressor is either the return of the hedging portfolio RH t or its dollar return
for a given choice of φ, and then vary φ to maximize the R̄2 .11
Figures 3 and 4 show how the R̄2 from the regression of RM t on the lagged return and
dollar-return, respectively, of the hedging portfolio varies with the value of φ in each of
the subperiods. In all cases, there is a unique global maximum, from which we obtain
φ. However, for some values of φ, the value of the hedging portfolio changes sign, and
in these cases, deﬁning the return on the portfolio becomes problematic. Therefore, we
eliminate these values from consideration, and for all subperiods except subperiod 4 and 7
(i.e., subperiods 2, 3, 5, 6), the omitted values of φ do not seem to aﬀect the choice of φ for
the maximum R2 .
For subperiods 2 to 7, the values for φ that give the maximum R2 are 1.25, 4.75, 1.75,
47, 38, and 0.25, respectively, using RH t as the predictor. Using QH t , the values of φ are 1.5,
11

This approach ignores the impact of statistical variation on the “optimal” φ, which is beyond the scope
of this paper but is explored further in related contexts by Foster, Smith, and Whaley (1997) and Lo and
MacKinlay (1997).

20

4.25, 2, 20, 27, and 0.75, respectively. With these values of φ in hand, we have fully speciﬁed
the hedging portfolio, its return and dollar return. Table 3 reports the summary statistics
for the return and dollar return on the hedging portfolio.

5.2

Optimal Forecasting Portfolios (OFPs)

Having constructed the return of the hedging portfolio in Section 5.1, we wish to compare
its forecast power to those of other factors. According to Proposition 2, the returns of the
hedging portfolio should outperform the returns of any other portfolios in predicting future
market returns. Speciﬁcally, if we regress RM t on the lagged return of any arbitrary portfolio
p, the R̄2 should be less than that of (33).
It is impractical to compare (33) to all possible portfolios, and uninformative to compare
it to random portfolios. Instead, we need only make comparisons to “optimal forecast portfolios”, portfolios that are optimal forecasters of RM t , since by construction, no other portfolios
can have higher levels of predictability than these. The following proposition shows how to
construct optimal forecasting portfolios (OFPs) (see Lo and Wang, 2001 for details):
Proposition 5 Let Γ0 and Γ1 denote the contemporaneous and ﬁrst-order autocovariance
matrix of the vector of all returns. For any arbitrary target portfolio q with weights wq =
(wq1 ; . . . ; wqN ), deﬁne A ≡ Γ0 −1 Γ1 wq wq  Γ1  . The optimal forecast portfolio of wq is given by
the normalized eigenvector of A corresponding to its largest eigenvalue.
Since Γ0 and Γ1 are unobservable, they must be estimated using historical data. Given
the large number of stocks in our sample (over 2,000 in each subperiod) and the relatively
short time series in each subperiod (261 weekly observations), the standard estimators for
Γ0 and Γ1 are not viable. However, it is possible to construct OFPs from a much smaller
number of “basis portfolios”, and then compare the predictive power of these OFPs to the
hedging portfolio. As long as the basis portfolios are not too specialized, the R̄2 s are likely
to be similar to those obtained from the entire universe of all stocks.
We form several sets of basis portfolios by sorting all the J stocks into K groups of
equal numbers (K ≤ J) according to: market capitalization, market beta, and SIC codes,
and then construct value-weighted portfolios within each group.12 This procedure yields K
12

It is important that we use value-weighted portfolios here so that the market portfolio, whose return

21

basis portfolios for which the corresponding Γ0 and Γ1 can be estimated using the portfolios’
weekly returns within each subperiod. Based on the estimated autocovariance matrices, the
OFP can be computed easily according to Proposition 5.
In selecting the number of basis portfolios K, we face the following trade-oﬀ: fewer portfolios yields better sampling properties for the covariance matrix estimators, but less desirable
properties for the OFP since the predictive power of the OFP is obviously maximized when
when K = J. As a compromise, for the OFPs based market capitalization and market betas,
we choose K to be 10, 15, 20, and 25. For the OFP based on SIC codes, we choose 13
industry groupings, described in more detail below.
Speciﬁcally, for each ﬁve-year subperiod in which we wish to evaluate the forecast power
of the hedging portfolio (the testing period), we use the previous ﬁve-year subperiod (the
estimation period) to estimate the OFPs. For the OFP based on 10 market-capitalizationsorted portfolios, which we call “CAP10”, we construct 10 value-weighted portfolios each
week, one for each market-capitalization decile. Market-capitalization deciles are recomputed
each week, and the time series of decile returns form the 10 basis portfolio returns of CAP10,
with which we can estimate Γ0 and Γ1 . To compute the OFP, we also require the weights
ωq of the target portfolio, in this case the market portfolio. Since the testing period follows
the estimation period, we use the market capitalization of each group in the last week of the
estimation period to map the weights of the market portfolio into a 10×1-vector of weights
for the 10 basis portfolios. The weights of the OFP for the basis portfolios CAP10 follow
immediately from Proposition 5. The same procedure is used to form OFPs for CAP15,
CAP20, and CAP25 basis portfolios.
The OFPs of market-beta-sorted basis portfolios are constructed in a similar manner.
We ﬁrst estimate the market betas of individual stocks in the estimation period, sort them
according to their estimated betas and then form small groups of basis portfolios, calculating
value-weighted returns for each group. We consider 10, 15, 20 and 25 groups, denoted by
“Beta10”, “Beta15”, and so on. The same procedure is then followed to construct the OFPs
for each of these sets of basis portfolios.
we wish to predict, is a portfolio of these basic portfolios (recall that the target portfolio ωq that we wish
to forecast is a linear combination of the vector of returns for which Γk is the k-th order autocovariance
matrix).

22

Finally, the industry portfolios are based on SIC-code groupings. The ﬁrst two digits
of the SIC code yield sixty to eighty industry categories, depending on the sample period,
and some of categories contain only one or two stocks. On the other, the ﬁrst digit yields
only eight broad industry categories. As a compromise, we use a slightly more disaggregated
grouping of 13 industries, given by the following correspondence:13

constructed according to Proposition 5.

Hedging Portfolio Return as A Predictor of Market Returns

Table 4 reports the results of the regressions of RM t on various lagged OFP returns and on
the hedging portfolios RH t and QH t . For completeness, we have also included four additional
regressions, with lagged value- and equal-weighted CRSP index returns, the logarithm of the
reciprocal of lagged market-capitalization, and the lagged three-month constant-maturity
Treasury bill return as predictors.14 Table 4 shows that the hedging portfolios outperforms
13

We are grateful to Jonathan Lewellen for sharing his industry classiﬁcation scheme.
We also considered nine other interest-rate predictors (six-month and one-year Treasury bill rates,
three-month, six-month, and one-year oﬀ-the-run Treasury bill rates, one-month and three-month CD
and Eurodollar rates, and the Fed Funds rate (all obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,
http://www.stls.frb.org/fred/data/wkly.html). Each of these variables produced results similar to those for
the three-month constant-maturity Treasury bill return, hence we omit those regressions from Table 4.

all of the other competing portfolios in forecasting future market returns in three of the six
subperiods (subperiods 2, 4, and 6). In subperiod 3, only one OFP (Beta20) outperforms
the hedging portfolio, and in subperiod 5, Beta20 and SIC13’s OFPs outperform the hedging
portfolio, but only marginally. And in subperiod 7, the equal-weighted CRSP index return
outperforms the hedging portfolio.
However, several caveats should be kept in mind with regard to the three subperiods in
which the hedging portfolios were surpassed by one or two competing portfolios. First, in
these three subperiods, the hedging portfolio still outperforms most of the other competing
portfolios. Second, there is no consistent winner in these subperiods. Third, the performance
of the hedging portfolios are often close to the best performer. Moreover, the best performers
in these subperiods performed poorly in the other subperiods, raising the possibility that
their performance might be due to sampling variation. In contrast, the hedging portfolios
forecasted RM t consistently in every subperiod. Indeed, among all of the regressors, the hedging portfolios were the most consistent across all six subperiods, a remarkable conﬁrmation
of the properties of the model of Sections 2 and 3.15

6

The Hedging-Portfolio Return as a Risk Factor

To evaluate the success of the hedging-portfolio return as a risk factor in the cross section
of expected returns, we implement a slightly modiﬁed version of the well-known regression
tests outlined in Fama and MacBeth (1973). The basic approach is the same: form portfolios
sorted by an estimated parameter such as market beta coeﬃcients in one time period (the
“portfolio-formation period”), estimate betas for those same portfolios in a second nonoverlapping time period (the “estimation period”), and perform a cross-sectional regression
test for the explanatory power of those betas using the returns of a third non-overlapping
time period (the “testing period”). However, in contrast to Fama and MacBeth (1973), we
use weekly instead of monthly returns, and our portfolio-formation, estimation, and testing
15

On the other hand, the results in Table 4 must be tempered by the fact that the OFPs are only as good
as the basis portfolios from which they are constructed. Increasing the number of basis portfolios should,
in principle, increase the predictive power of the OFP. However, as the number of basis portfolios increases,
1 also increase for a ﬁxed set of time series
the estimation errors in the autocovariance estimators γ
0 and γ
observations, hence the impact on the predictive power of the OFP is not clear.

24

periods are ﬁve years each.16
Speciﬁcally, we run the following bivariate regression for each security in the portfolioformation period, using only those securities that exist in all three periods:17
Rjt = αj + βjM RM t + βjH RH t + εit

(34)

where RM t is the return on the CRSP value-weighted index and RHt is the return on the
hedging portfolio. Using the estimated coeﬃcients {βM } and {βH }, we perform a double sort
i

i

among the individual securities in the estimation period, creating 100 portfolios corresponding to the deciles of the estimated market and hedging-portfolio betas. We re-estimate the
two betas for each of these 100 portfolios in the estimation period, and use these estimated
betas as regressors in the testing period, for which we estimate the following cross-sectional
regression:
Rpt = γ0t + γ1t βpM + γ2t βpH + ηpt

(35)

where Rpt is the equal-weighted portfolio return for securities in portfolio p, p = 1, . . . , 100,
constructed from the double-sorted rankings of the portfolio-estimation period, and βM and
pt

H
are the market and hedging-portfolio returns, respectively, of portfolio p obtained from
βpt

the estimation period. This cross-sectional regression is estimated for each of the 261 weeks
in the ﬁve-year testing period, yielding a time series of coeﬃcients {
γ0t }, {
γ1t }, and {
γ2t }.
Summary statistics for these coeﬃcients and their diagnostics are then reported, and this
entire procedure is repeated by incrementing the portfolio-formation, estimation, and testing
periods by ﬁve years. We then perform the same analysis for the hedge-portfolio dollar-return
series {QH t }.
Because we use weekly instead of monthly data, it may be diﬃcult to compare our
results to other cross-sectional tests in the extant literature, e.g., Fama and French (1992).
Therefore, we apply our procedure to three other benchmark models: the standard CAPM in
16

Our ﬁrst portfolio-formation period, from 1962 to 1966, is only four and a half years because the CRSP
Daily Master ﬁle begins in July 1962. Fama and MacBeth’s (1973) original procedure used a seven-year
portfolio-formation period, a ﬁve-year estimation period, and a four-year testing period.
17
This induces a certain degree of survivorship bias, but the eﬀects may not be as severe given that we
apply the selection criterion three periods at a time. Moreover, while survivorship bias has a clear impact
on expected returns and on the size eﬀect, its implications for the cross-sectional explanatory power of the
hedging portfolio is less obvious, hence we proceed cautiously with this selection criterion.

which RM t is the only regressor in (34) and 100 market-beta-sorted portfolios constructed, a
two-factor model in which the hedging-portfolio return factor is replaced by a “small-minusbig capitalization” or “SMB” portfolio return factor as in Fama and French (1993), and a
two-factor model in which the hedging-portfolio return factor is replaced by the OFP return
factor described in Section 5.2.18
Table 5 reports the the correlations between the diﬀerent portfolio return factors, returns
on CRSP value- and equal-weighted portfolios, return and dollar return on the hedging
portfolio, returns on the SMB portfolio and, OFP, Beta20, and the two turnover indices.
Table 6 reports the summary statistics for the return betas from the ﬁve risk models on
returns: the single-factor market model and the four two-factors models.
Table 7 summarizes the results of all of these cross-sectional regression tests for each of
the ﬁve testing periods from 1972 to 1996. In the ﬁrst subpanel, corresponding to the ﬁrst
testing period from 1972 to 1976, there is little evidence in support of the CAPM or any
of the two-factor models estimated.19 For example, the ﬁrst three rows show that the timeseries average of the market-beta coeﬃcients, {
γ1t }, is 0.000, with a t-statistic of 0.348 and
an average R̄2 of 10.0%.20 When the hedging-portfolio beta βH is added to the regression,
t

the R̄2 does increase to 14.3% but the average of the coeﬃcients {γ̂2t } is −0.002 with a
t-statistic of −0.820. The average market-beta coeﬃcient is still insigniﬁcant, but it has now
switched sign. The results for the two-factor model with the hedging-portfolio dollar-return
factor and the two-factor model with the SMB factor are similar.
In the second testing period, both speciﬁcations with the hedging-portfolio factor exhibit
statistically signiﬁcant means for the hedging-portfolio betas, with average coeﬃcients and
t-statistics of −0.012 and −3.712 for the hedging-portfolio return factor and −1.564 and
−4.140 for the hedging-portfolio dollar-return factor, respectively. In contrast, the market18

Speciﬁcally, the SMB portfolio return is constructed by taking the diﬀerence of the value-weighted returns
of securities with market capitalization below and above the median market capitalization at the start of
the ﬁve-year subperiod.
19
The two-factor model with OFP as the second factor is not estimated until the second testing period
because we use the 1962–1966 period to estimate the covariances from which the OFP returns in the 1967–
1971 period are constructed. Therefore, the OFP returns are not available in the ﬁrst portfolio-formation
period.
20
The t-statistic is computed under the assumption of independently and identically distributed coeﬃcients
{γ1t }, which may not be appropriate. However, since this has become the standard method for reporting
the results of these cross-sectional regression tests, we follow this convention to make our results comparable
to those in the literature.

26

beta coeﬃcients are not signiﬁcant in either of these speciﬁcations, and are also of the wrong
sign. The only other speciﬁcation with a signiﬁcant mean coeﬃcient is the two-factor model
with SMB as the second factor, with an average coeﬃcient of 0.299 for the SMB factor and
a t-statistic of 4.433.
For the three remaining test periods, the only speciﬁcations with any statistically signiﬁcant factors are the SMB and MPP two-factor models in the 1992–1996 testing period.
However, the R̄2 s in the last two testing periods are substantially lower than in the earlier
periods, perhaps reﬂecting the greater volatility of equity returns in recent years.
Overall, the results do not provide overwhelming support for any factor in explaining the
cross-sectional variation of expected returns. There is, of course, the ubiquitous problem of
lack of power in these cross-sectional regression tests, hence we should not be surprised that
no single factor stands out.21 However, the point estimates of the cross-sectional regressions
show that the hedging-portfolio factor is comparable in magnitude and in performance to
other commonly proposed factors.

Conclusion

By deriving an explicit link between economic fundamentals and the dynamic properties of
asset returns and volume, we have shown that interactions between prices and quantities in
equilibrium yield a rich set of implications for any asset-pricing model. Indeed, by exploiting
the relation between prices and volume in our dynamic equilibrium model, we are able to
identify and construct the hedging portfolio that all investors use to hedge against changes
in market conditions. Moreover, our empirical analysis shows that this hedging portfolio has
considerable forecast power in predicting future returns of the market portfolio—a property of
the true hedging portfolio—and its abilities to explain cross-sectional variation in expected
returns is comparable to other popular risk factors such as market betas, the Fama and
French (1993) SMB factor, and optimal forecast portfolios.
Although our model is purposefully parsimonious so as to focus attention on the essential
features of risk-sharing and trading activity, it underscores the general point that quantities,
together with prices, should be an integral part of any analysis of asset markets, both the21

oretically and empirically. Our results provide compelling motivation for determining risk
factors from economic fundamentals rather than through statistical means. Although this
is an old theme that has its origins in Black (1972), Mayers (1973), and Merton (1973),
it has become less fashionable as competing approaches such as the statistical approach of
Roll and Ross (1980) and Chamberlain and Rothschild (1983) and the empirical approach
of Fama and French (1992) have become more popular. We hope to revive interest in the
lofty goal of identifying risk factors through the logic of equilibrium analysis in general, and
by exploiting the information contained in trading volume in particular.

Appendix
A.1

Proof of Theorem 1

We prove Theorem 1 by ﬁrst deriving the investors’ asset demand under the price function
(8) and then solves the coeﬃcient vector a and b to clear the stock market.
For simplicity in notation, let ut ≡ (Dt ; Xt ), where (·; ·) denotes a column vector and
(·, ·) denotes a row vector. From (8), we have
Qt+1 = Q̄t + Q̃t+1
where
Q̄t = ra + (1+r)bXt

and Q̃t+1 = (1, −b)ut+1

where 1 is an (n × n) identity matrix. We also let λ1t ≡ λX Xt + λY Yti and λ2t ≡ λZ (1 + Zti ).
We now consider investor i’s optimal portfolio choice. Let St be the vector of his stock
holding in period t. His wealth next period is Wt+1 = Wt + St  Q̄t+1 + St  (1, −b)ut+1 , where
we have omitted superscript i for brevity. Then,

0 = Q̄t − σDD − bσDX  − σDX b + σXX bb St − λ1t (σDD − bσDZ )ι − λ2t (σDX − bσXX ). (A.2)

(1 + r)b = λX σQD ι
which uniquely determine the equilibrium a and b. Substitute (A.4) into (A.3), we obtain
investor i’s equilibrium stock holding:

Proofs of Propositions 1–4

Proof of Proposition 1
A proof of a more general version of Proposition 1 with multiple funds is given in Lo and
Wang (2000a). Q.E.D.
Proof of Proposition 2
Suppose we use the (dollar) return of portfolio S to predict future market return. The
resulting R2 is

R2 = Cov[(S  Qt )QM t+1 ] / Var[S  Qt ]Var[QM t+1 ] .

S  σQQ S = v.

Up to a scaling constant, the solution is SH = (σQQ )−1 σQX . Q.E.D.

30

Proof of Proposition 3
When Xt = 0 ∀ t, Qt = ra + Q̃t = (1, −b)ut . Then, Cov[Q̃t , Q̃M t ] = Cov[Q̃t , ι Q̃t ] = σDD ι,
2
Var[Q̃M t ] = ι σDD ι and (17) follows. Since σQX = 0 in this case, σM H = 0 and Q̄M = (1/I)σM
.

Thus, Q̄ = βM Q̄M which is (18). Q.E.D.
Proof of Proposition 4
Equation (19) simply follows from the joint normality of Q̃t+1 , Q̃M t+1 , and Q̃H t+1 . (20) can
be veriﬁed by substituting in the expressions for βM , βM , Q̄M and Q̄H , which gives (16c).

Table 1
Summary statistics for the restricted volume betas using weekly returns and volume data for NYSE
and AMEX stocks from 1962 to 1996. Turnover over individual stocks is regressed on the equallyweighted and share- weighted turnover indices, subject to the restriction that the two regression
coeﬃcients, βτEW and βτSW , must add up to one. The stocks are then sorted into ten deciles by
βτEW . The summary statistics are then reported for each decile.

Summary statistics for the unrestricted volume betas using weekly returns and volume data for NYSE and
AMEX stocks from 1962 to 1996. Turnover over individual stocks are regressed on the equally-weighted and
share- weighted turnover indices, giving two regression coeﬃcients, βτEW and βτSW . The stocks are then sorted
into ten deciles by the estimates of their βτEW . The summary statistics are reported for each decile. The last two
columns report the test statistic for the condition that βτEW and βτSW add up to one.

Forecast of weekly market-portfolio returns by lagged weekly returns of the beta-sorted optimal forecast portfolios (OFPs),
the market-capitalization-sorted OFP’s, the SIC-sorted OFP, the return and dollar return on the hedging portfolio, minus
log-market-capitalization, and the lagged returns on the CRSP value- and equal-weighted portfolios from 1962 to 1996, and
lagged constant-maturity (three-month) Treasury bill rates from 1982 to 1996. The value of φ is 1.25 for the return RH and
1.5 for the dollar return QH on the hedging portfolio, respectively.

Summary statistics for market betas estimated with weekly returns data for NYSE and AMEX
stocks from July 1962 to December 1996 in ﬁve-year subperiods. Returns of individual stocks are
regressed on the returns of the CRSP value-weighted returns index, yielding the beta coeﬃcient βjM .
The betas are sorted into deciles and means and standard deviations of the estimated coeﬃcients
are reported for each decile.

Table 6b
Summary statistics for market and hedging-portfolio return betas estimated with weekly returns
data for NYSE and AMEX stocks from July 1962 to December 1996 in ﬁve-year subperiods.
Returns of individual stocks are regressed on the returns of the CRSP value-weighted returns index
and the hedging-portfolio return index RHt , yielding two beta coeﬃcients βjM and βjHR . The pairs
are sorted into deciles according to their market betas and means and standard deviations of the
estimated coeﬃcients are reported for each decile.

Table 6c
Summary statistics for market and hedging-portfolio dollar-return betas estimated with weekly
returns data for NYSE and AMEX stocks from July 1962 to December 1996 in ﬁve-year subperiods.
Returns of individual stocks are regressed on the returns of the CRSP value-weighted returns index
and the hedging-portfolio dollar-return index QHt , yielding two beta coeﬃcients βjM and βjHQ . The
pairs are sorted into deciles according to their market betas and means and standard deviations
of the estimated coeﬃcients are reported for each decile.

Table 6e
Summary statistics for market and optimal-forecast-portfolio return betas estimated with weekly
returns data for NYSE and AMEX stocks from July 1962 to December 1996 in ﬁve-year subperiods.
Returns of individual stocks are regressed on the returns of the CRSP value-weighted returns index
and the return ROF P t of the optimal-forecast portfolio (OFP) for the set of 25 market-beta-sorted
basis portfolios, yielding two beta coeﬃcients βjM and βjOF P . The pairs are sorted into deciles
according to their market betas and means and standard deviations of the estimated coeﬃcients
are reported for each decile.

Table 7
Cross-sectional regression tests of various linear factor models along the lines of Fama and
MacBeth (1973) using weekly returns for NYSE and AMEX stocks from 1962 to 1996,
ﬁve-year subperiods for the portfolio-formation, estimation, and testing periods, and 100
portfolios in the cross-sectional regressions each week. The ﬁve linear-factor models are:
the standard CAPM (βpM ), and four two-factor models in which the ﬁrst factor is the
market beta and the second factors are, respectively, the hedging portfolio return beta
(βpHR ), the hedging portfolio dollar-return beta (βpHQ ), the beta of a small-minus-big cap
portfolio return (βpSM B ), and the beta of the optimal forecast portfolio based on a set of 25
market-beta-sorted basis portfolios (βpOF P ).
