ABSTRACT
In this paper, we examine which markets are most synchronized internationally and exhibit the
greater extent of comovement. We focus on daily data for four asset markets: bonds, equities, foreign
exchange, and domestic money market. Our sample covers thirty-five developed and emerging market
countries during 1997-1999. The extent of comovement and responsiveness to external shocks is
examined in different ways. To measure the response of these markets to adverse external shocks, we date
the peaks in domestic interest rates and bond spreads and the largest daily declines in equity prices and
assess the extent of clustering around the same period. We also analyze which markets show evidence
of greatest comovement in general, irrespective of whether there are adverse shocks or not.

I. Introduction
Much has been written about globalization and the greater degree of capital market
integration in the past decade. One strand in this vast literature has developed a variety of
approaches to test for the extent of capital mobility.1 Another rapidly-growing branch has
attempted to document the incidence of contagion, spillovers, or international propagation of
shocks. Often, these studies focussed on the cross-country correlations of asset returns.2
However, most of this literature has paid little attention to the probable case that not all
asset markets are likely to be equally affected by external shocks or equally integrated
internationally.3 4 Such differentiation in the sensitivity to external shocks or the extent of global
integration may arise for several reasons. For example, Reinhart and Reinhart (1999) provide a
simple model where investors have perfect access to the international bond market but bank
customers have less complete access. They show that if depositors have access to international
capital markets interest rates on deposits will co-move with international interest rates on bonds,
but if borrowers cannot borrow from abroad lending rates of interest need not covary with the
interational interest rates on bonds. 5 Similarly, if a government allows its bonds to be freely
traded internationally but has restrictions on the foreign ownership of equities, one would expect

External shocks may take the form of a rise in international interest rates, an oil shock,
or a financial crisis in another country.

Obviously, the opposite is true if borrowers are the ones with access to international
capital markets, while depositors do not.

that bond yields would be more responsive to external shocks than equity returns. However,
market segmentation of these types will not be the only reason why some asset markets may be
more sensitive to external shocks than others. While a variety of narratives describing episodes
of contagion suggest that speculative attacks on currencies are bunched together across countries,
the heterogeneity in exchange rate arrangements and monetary policy across countries would
suggest that exchange rates and the “policy” domestic interest rate are likely to covary
internationally less than an internationally traded sovereign bond or equity.6 Similarly, equity
price indices may have a markedly different industry composition across countries, which may
act to dampen comovement with equity markets across the border. In other words, the domestic
idyosynchratic component in some asset markets is greater than in others.
In this paper, we examine which markets are most synchronized internationally and
exhibit the greater extent of comovement. We focus on daily data for four asset markets: bonds,
equities, foreign exchange, and domestic money market. Our sample covers thirty-five developed
and emerging market countries during 1997-1999. The extent of comovement and responsiveness
to external shocks is examined in three different ways. First, to measure the response of these
markets to adverse external shocks, we date the peaks in domestic interest rates and bond spreads
and the largest daily declines in equity prices and assess the extent of clustering around the same
period. Second, we conduct principal component anylisis over the entire sample to analyze
which markets show evidence of greatest comovement in general, irrespective of whether there
are adverse shocks or not. Lastly, we look for volatility spillovers, working with the simplest of

One example is Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz (1995), which analyzes of Europe’s
Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis.

the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models to examine
whether there was a marked change in volatility much along the lines of Edwards and Susmel
(2000).
In the next section, we describe and date the various episodes of regional or global
financial turmoil that we study and provide some background on the international setting during
our sample period. In Section III, we compare the extent of comovement across countries and
the profile of daily volatility in four asset markets--bond, equity, foreign exchange, and domestic
money market. Concluding remarks, sprinkled with some policy implications, are presented in
Section IV.
II. Episodes and Background
In what follows, we turn our attention to some of the events or “shocks” that have shaped
financial markets in recent years; all these episodes are likely to be familiar to the reader, as these
have received considerable attention from the financial press.

1. Asset markets
Shocks may be confined to a single market, such as equities, or may have more farreaching consequences, simultaneously affecting foreign exchange, domestic money, and the
international bond markets. Most often, when a country is mired in a deep financial crisis, all
markets are affected; the currency weakens, domestic interest rates rise as expectations are
unsettled and/or the monetary authorities tighten policy to restore credibility, the terms of
borrowing in international capital markets (assuming access is not lost altogether) deteriorates,
and other asset prices (i.e., equity and real estate) slide. Volatility increases across the board.
3

Milder periods of turbulence, owing to external developments, may not have such widespread
effects. For instance, the period of financial market turbulence around October 27-28, 1997, was
nearly global in scope but was largely confined to equity markets. In the analysis that follows,
we will pay particular attention to how the spread of disturbances across countries differs among
the four asset markets we study.

2. Events
Table 1 presents a brief chronology of significant events during the January 1, 1997August 31, 1999 period. The list is not meant to be exhaustive, rather it highlights some of the
key episodes we analyze.7 In the remainder of this paper, our focus is primarily on four events.
In chronological order, they are: the devaluation of the Thai baht on July 2, 1997; the Russian
devaluation and default on August 17, 1998; the September 1-2, 1998 stint, during which
Malaysia introduced fairly drastic capital control measures (on September 1st) and LTCM issued
a letter to its shareholders revealing its precarious condition (on September 2nd); and the
recapitalization of LTCM that began on September 23rd, 1998.
While these events are a focal point of our study, there are other episodes that are
encompassed in our analysis. These include: the crash of the U.S. equity market and the
speculative attack on Hong Kong on October 28, 1997; the evolution of the Korean crisis
following the devaluation of the won on November 17, 1997; the closure of Solomon Brothers’

events in the fall of 1998, see Bank of International Settlements (1999); and for a more extensive
chronology of capital controls see Edison and Reinhart (2001).

bond arbitrage desk on July 6, 1998; the first Wall Street Journal article on the profit pressures on
LTCM on July 20, 1998; the inter-FOMC meeting reduction in U.S. interest rates on October 15,
1998; and the Brazilian devaluation on January 13, 1999, which also coincided with rumors
about a possible debt crisis in China.

3. Data and sample
Our data is daily and spans the period beginning on January 1st, 1997 through August
31st, 1999. Because of the daily frequency of the data, the variables we analyze are confined to
financial markets. Specifically, these variables are: the domestic “policy” interest rate-whenever possible, overnight interbank interest rates are used; the daily return on equities in the
local currency taken from local bourse indices;8 the percent change in the daily exchange rate
versus the dollar or versus the deutschemark (DM);9 and, the interest rate spreads on bonds that
capture the “pricing of risk”. For the industrial countries, the interest rate spread is between
corporate and sovereign bonds, while for emerging markets the spread is between a sovereign
bond and a comparable United States Treasury security. The particulars for all the data used for
the thirty-five countries in our sample are provided, along with their respective sources, in the
Data Appendix.

8

More precisely, returns are defined as the percent change in equity prices, as dividend
data is not available on a daily frequency.
9

For all the countries the exchange rate is bilateral against the U.S. dollar. The
exceptions are Estonia and the European countries, for which bilateral exchange rates versus the
DM are used. The exchange rate is expressed as number of local currency units per dollar or DM;
hence, and increase denotes a depreciation. After January 1, 1999, DM quotes are based on a
strict translation from euros.
5

The countries in our sample cover more of the mature-to-emerging-market range of
experiences. Countries with less developed capital markets and a significant extent of financial
repression are not a part of this study, as the focus rests on high-frequency capital market
developments. We can classify the sample into five, somewhat arbitrary, seven-country
groupings: The G7 countries, which are comprised of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
United Kingdom, and the United States; and the transition economies, which include Bulgaria,
Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Russia, and the Ukraine. The remaining three groups
are primarily by region. There is the Asian cluster, which includes Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. The other European group,
which excludes those countries that are part of the G7, and includes, Finland, Greece, Holland,
Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the non-European Turkey. Finally, the Latin American sample
consists of the larger economies in the region, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru,
and Venezuela.

4. The international setting
Tables 2 and 3 present a broad brush view of the key variables during three sub-periods in
our sample: the period in between the devaluation of the Thai baht and that of the Russian ruble;
the couple of weeks in between the Russian devaluation and the introduction of capital controls
in Malaysia, which occurs a day before LTCM issued a letter to its shareholders; and the stretch
between that day and the relatively rare interim easing of monetary policy in the United States.
Table 2 presents the cumulative change in the variables of interest, which simply compares the
end point to the first observation of the sample. Hence, for example, interest rates were roughly
6

the same on August 17, 1998 as they were on July 1, 1997 for the G7 and the Latin American
economies, although, rates were higher for the Asian and transition economies (7.09 and 13.14
percent, respectively.) Since the first sub-sample covers a much longer period, Table 3 presents
the same data for daily changes at a monthly rate.10 So, for instance, during the first sub-sample,
interest rates rose (on average) by 0.69 percent per month for the transition economies, but the
increase was close to zero for the G7 countries.
The three subsamples are quite distinct from one another. Prior to the Russian crisis,
Asian exchange rates had depreciated markedly against the US dollar--largely owing to the
collapse of the Indonesian rupiah. Asian equity prices fell 56 percent, while the terms at which
they could borrow in international capital markets deteriorated, as reflected in the widening of
bond spreads of 354 basis points. Over this period, other emerging markets also experienced
declining asset prices, despite relatively stable exchange rates and interest rates. For the Latin
American group, equity prices fell 32 percent, as equity markets in the region fell across the
board.11 More surprisingly, bond yield spreads widened 522 basis points--even more than for the
Asian crisis countries.12 The widening in bond spreads is even more pronounced for the
transition economies. However, this is largely owing to Russia. Equity markets were falling
nearly everywhere for the transition group, with the exception of Hungary. By contrast, most

10

Specifically, the change reported in Table 3 divided by the number of days in the
subsample raised to 30 to present it as a monthly rate.
11

The decline in equity prices was largest for Venezuela (56 percent) and smallest for
Colombia (11 percent).
12

Again, the largest deterioration was for Venezuelan bonds, as the spread widened by
1,793 basis points.
7

European and G-7 equity markets had substantial rallies during this period, with notable
exceptions being Japan (down 25 percent) and Norway (down 11 percent).
Following the Russian devaluation and before the LTCM story entered the public domain,
the picture changes markedly.13 Equity markets take a tumble everywhere, with the exceptions of
South Korea and Russia, which begins to recover from its massive slide. Latin American
markets are particularly hard hit. Bond spreads widen dramatically, especially for Latin
American sovereign borrowers. For Russia the spread widens more than 6,300 basis points. Bidask spreads on debt instruments also widen dramatically, reflecting the loss of market liquidity.
As the next section will illustrate in the context a simple model, this reflected several
withdrawals from risk-taking. Domestic interest rates in Latin America rise during this period,
with Mexico and Peru posting the largest increases. The higher interest rates during this period
owe both to the loss of credibility many emerging markets suffered following the Russian
default--in part on the reassessment of the likelihood of bailouts by the International Monetary
Fund--and to the use of tight-money policies by many emerging market central banks to defend
exchange rates.
What is striking about the last subsample, which are the six weeks preceding the Fed’s
interest rate cut, is that emerging markets appeared to be recovering already from the Russian
shock. Interest rates had started to decline, particularly in Asia, while equity markets were
recovering, especially in Malaysia and Thailand. Bond spreads for Latin America had began to
narrow (by about 289 basis points), although yields spreads remained well above pre-crisis

early as July 20.

levels. For industrial countries the picture is very different from the emerging markets, as equity
markets continued to tumble and bond spreads widened further.
This strikingly divergent performance between emerging and mature capital markets in
this last period may owe to the fact that, during these weeks, there was much speculation in
financial circles, as to whether there would be more LTCMs. Hence, there was concern about the
health of the financial centers, rather then the periphery. By then, the periphery had already been
hard hit and portfolio inflows of capital (bond and equity) had dramatically dried up. This stands
in contrast to the equity market booms most of the industrial countries were enjoying prior to the
Russian/LTCM shock.

III. International Comovement in Asset Markets: Some Evidence
To begin our enquiry as to which asset markets show the greatest extent of comovement
across countries, we examine some basic descriptive statistics. In particular, we compare the
dates of maximum and minimum values during the full sample to those of the episodes we are
interested in analyzing. Many of the countries in our sample do not allow their currencies to float
freely--even when they say they do.14 As a consequence, we focus in the overnight domestic
interest rate, as the highest rates may be associated with speculative attacks on the foreign
exchange market. Table 4, which provides the dates of the maximum values, reveals that, for
most of the Asian countries in our sample, interest rate peaks occur in the second half of 1997

14

See Reinhart (2000) and Calvo and Reinhart (2000) on the pervasiveness of the “fear of
floating” across both industrial and emerging market countries.
9

and into early 1998, a period of much turbulence in the region.15 August and September 1998
also shows numerous entries, coinciding with the Russia/LTCM crises. However, with only a
couple of exceptions, peaks in domestic interest rates are not highly synchronized across
countries. The global coordination of disturbances is far more evident in Tables 5 and 6, which
provide the dates of the largest daily equity market declines and the largest increase in the bond
yield spread. These equity market crashes are overwhelmingly clustered on October 27-28, 1997
and in the interval between the Russian devaluation and the Federal Reserve’s intermeeting
interest rate cut. The bunching of disturbances across countries is even more evident in the bond
spread data presented in Table 6. With a few exceptions, the largest daily increases occur in the
late summer and fall of 1998.
On the basis of these simple observations, it would appear that the October 1997
disturbance, while far-reaching in its global scope was, confined to equity markets, while the
August-October 1998 disturbances extended to bond markets as well.

1. Principal component analysis
To assess more formally how the degree of comovement across countries in several
financial variables evolves over time and across regions, we applied principal component
analysis to the financial time series data over the full sample, as well as several subsamples.
We focus on four daily time series, the domestic policy interest rate, the return on equity,
the change in the exchange rate (in percent), and the bond spreads, for thirty-four of the thirty-

15

This will be discussed in more detail in the next section.
10

five countries in our.16 From these series, we constructed a smaller set of series, the principal
components, that explain as much of the variance of the original series as possible. The higher
the degree of co-movement in the original series, the fewer the number of principal components
needed to explain a large portion of the variance of the original series. In case where the original
series are identical (perfectly collinear), the first principal component would explain 100 percent
of the variation in the original series. Alternatively, if the series are orthogonal to one another, it
would take as many principal components as there are series to explain all the variance in the
original series. In that case, no advantage would be gained by looking at common factors, as
none exist.
The procedure begins by standardizing the variables so that each series has a zero mean
and a unit standard deviation. This standardization ensures that all series receive equal treatment
and the construction of the principal component indices is not influenced disproportionately by
the series exhibiting the largest variation. The correlation matrix of the standardized series, E, is
decomposed into its Eigen-vectors (P) and the diagonal matrix of Eigen-values (7).
(1)

The Eigen-vectors are the loading factors, or weights, attached to each of the original series. For
a particular time-series, the higher the degree of comovement with other series the higher (in
absolute value) its loading factor. If a particular time series is uncorrelated with the remaining
series included in the analysis, then its loading factor in the first principal component should be
16

Owing to limited data availability, Bulgaria is excluded from the sample.
11

close to zero. A priori, this is what we should expect to see for the time series of, say, a small
country with a “perfectly idiosyncratic” shock, or for a country which has binding capital
controls.17
The results are presented in Tables 7-8 for the four regional groupings and for the G-7
countries. The share of the variance of the original series (in this case equity returns) explained
by the first principal component ranges from a low of 0.36 for the transition economies to a high
of 0.57 percent for the European group--with the other groups falling in between. These results
are hardly surprising, in light of the lack of homogeneity in the Transition economies group
relative to the higher degree of integration in Europe.
Examining the factor loadings by region or group, the outcomes are equally intuitive.
Among the Asian countries in our sample (Japan excluded), South Korea has the lowest factor
loading (0.24); this result is not surprising, given that that its own financial crisis began months
after the onset of turmoil in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.18 Malaysia
shows the next-to-least degree of comovement (the loading factor is 0.32)--then again, Malaysia
had capital controls throughout the latter part of the sample. Among the European grouping, the
extent of comovement is the least for Turkey, which has unresolved chronic inflation problems,
and Greece. Among the G7 countries, the patterns of comovement are also largely defined along
regions. The four European countries move in unison, the United States and Canada move in

17

As the controls insulate the country from external disturbances (see Edison and
Reinhart, 1999).

economies before and after the 1997 crisis.
12

another block;19 and Japan shows the least comovement with the other G7 countries.
Turning to Latin America, comovement is strongest among the larger three--Argentina,
Brazil and Mexico, and least for Colombia and Venezuela. These patterns of covariation are not
unique to the 1997-1999 sample. In the immediate aftermath of the Mexican crisis, when most
Latin American equity markets posted substantial declines, Colombia’s equity market posted
moderate gains.20 Lastly, comovement is strongest among the earlier reformers--Poland, the
Czech Republic, and Hungary--and weakest the Republics of the the former Soviet Union.
Tables 15 and 16 also report, for comparison purposes, the results for interest rate
changes and exchange rates. As is evident for all the country groups, the extent of covariation is
noticeably lower reaching reaching 0.4 for any group’s excxhange rates and interest rates.

2. Conditional variances
In this section, we work with the simplest of the generalized autoregressive conditional
heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models to examine whether there was a marked change in volatility
during and around the various episodes analyzed in the preceding section.21 We consider the
following models:

19

This is evident in the factor loadings of the second principal component, shown in the
next column.
20

See Calvo and Reinhart (1996) for an analysis of this episode.

21

In all cases a GARCH (1, 1) model was estimated.
13

(3)

where stock returns are denoted by rt, in equation (3), and the random shock is denoted by ,.22 In
the variance equation, T is the mean of the variance; the lag of the mean squared residual from
the mean equation (i.e., ,2t-1 ) is the ARCH term and last period’s forecast variance (i.e.,

F2t-1) is the GARCH term. The number of autoregressive lags, k, was selected on a country-bycountry basis using both the Akaike and Shwartz criteria; if these yielded different results as
regards the optimal lag length, both models were estimated. We also estimated a comparable
model for the domestic interest rate and the change (in percent) of the exchange rate. Periods of
turbulence that are part of our sample of daily observations render the assumption of identically
and independently distributed conditionally normal disturbances in the most basic GARCH
model inadequate.23 Given the presence of heteroskedastic disturbances in our sample (i.e., the

,s), we use the methods described in Bollersev and Woolridge (1992) to compute the QuasiMaximum Likelihood covariances and standard errors.
The conditional variance of daily equity returns is plotted for each country in Appendix

22

More precisely, the variable in question is capital gains or losses, as there is no
dividend data at a daily frequency.

fundamentals during crises periods in the analysis of the international transmission of shocks,

14

Figures 1-18, while some of the most salient features of this exercise are summarized in Tables
17-21. Before turning to a discussion of specific countries, however, there are some general
patterns that emerge from the analysis of the conditional variance of equity returns for these
thirty three countries that merit mention. Even without knowing what events transpired during
the three years covered in our sample, the equity returns data reveal four periods of general
market stress, as reflected in large-to-moderate spikes in the variance of equity returns. Two
periods stand out most clearly from a review of the figures: a marked period of turbulence at endOctober-early November of 1997 in most of the equity markets in our sample--this episode was,
for the most part, relatively short-lived; and a more severe and far more protracted bout of
volatility that, for most countries, begins in August of 1998 and lasts through October of that
year. 24 Indeed, a tally of the information presented in Tables 9-13 reveals that in more than half
of the countries in the sample the largest spikes in volatility were recorded in the late summer
and fall of 1998 and, that in nineteen of the thirty-three countries, this period was associated with
the most persistent bout of volatility in the sample.
In addition to the two more obvious episodes of market volatility on a global scale, there
are two periods of market stress which merit discussion. The first of these occurs in early 1998,
at the height of the Asian crisis and it engulfs all the Asian countries in our sample, including
Japan.25 Indeed, for seven of the countries in our sample (all in Asia), this episode shows the
24

The first of these episodes lines up with the equity market crash in New York and,
particularly Hong Kong on October 28, 1997, while the second spans the Russian crisis-LTCM
debacle.
25

Korea’s devaluation of the won occurs on November 17 and their negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund last into late December 1997-early January 1998. Furthermore,
during this period there are recurring rumors that China will devalue and set the stage for a new
15

most marked and persistent rise in equity market volatility. The high volatility during this
period, however, is largely confined to Asia, as both mature and emerging markets elsewhere are
relatively tranquil. The other market turbulence episode revealed by this data occurs in January
1999, and it is most evident in Latin America. The equity markets of four countries in our
sample (all in Latin America) record their largest spike in volatility in that month; the shock,
however, seems to be relatively short-lived. Several European and Transition economies’ equity
markets also show more moderate increases in volatility. This spike corresponds to both the
Brazilian devaluation of the real and several market disruptions after the Chinese government
refused to help foreign creditors of GITIC. Fears of debt crisis in China also swept through Hong
Kong at this time.
As regards individual countries, it is worth noting that in some cases overlap with “global
events” may be more of a coincidence that the conditional variances reveal. For example, as
discussed earlier in the context of the principal component analysis, Colombia is a country whose
equity market shows little comovement with the rest of Latin America or other equity markets.
Its deep financial crisis, which occurs shortly after the devaluation of the ruble, had little to do
with Russia or LTCM--as it had been brewing for fundamental reasons for some time. Similarly,
the spike in interest rates in Greece following the equity market turbulence in end-October 1997,
was owing to an attack on the drachma motivated by predominantly domestic considerations.
Another feature of the conditional variances, which applies to several “crisis” countries, is that
the conditional volatility of equity returns remains consistently higher in the post-crisis period.
This is most evident of Indonesia and South Korea, but it also applies to Colombia, the
round of financial instability in the region.
16

Philippines, and Thailand. In sum, the analysis of the variance of equity prices provides
additional support that disturbances have an important global dimension in the period under
scrutiny. Far more so than what is observed in foreign exchange and money markets.

VI. Concluding Comments
This paper has presented evidence to suggest that there are important differences in the
responsiveness to external shocks and, more broadly, in the extent of international
synchronization across asset categories. Hence, the implications that one can draw about the
extent of globalization and the degree of capital market integration depends importantly on which
is the market examined. With the exception of the G-7, which includes heterogenous cycles
among the United States and Canada, Europe, and Japan, bond yield spreads exhibit--by far--the
highest degree of comovement both across countries for the entire sample and various
subsamples.26 One can speculate that, given that these spreads are dominated by sovereign risk,
they represent a more homogeneous asset class than the equity, currency and, money market
counterparts. A distant second in the extent of comovement in returns (again the exception being
the G-7 group) are equity markets; for the G-7 countries, however, equity markets are the most
correlated of the four asset markets we examine. Furthermore, in terms synchronicity, as
measured by the overlap of dates in which the largest declines were observed, equity markets
also show substantial responsiveness to external shocks.
For nearly all the regions or country groupings, the exchange rate market, followed bonds

26

request.
17

and equities (in that order) as the most correlated across countries. The policy interest rate, not
surprisingly--given the heterogeneity across countries in monetary policy and the extent of
credibility--comes as a distant fourth in terms of international comovement. Idyosynchratic
domestic shocks appear to be the dominant factor in explaining their behavior.
In sum, studying the extent of capital mobility and the impacts of external shocks has
been most often too limited to focussing on a particular asset market. Our results taken together
suggest that even countries with little capital account restrictions may be subject to other forms
of capital market segmentation. Hence, the differences in the degree of capital mobility is
something that not only needs to be understood across countries, but across markets in a
particular country as well.
