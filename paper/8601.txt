The Out-of-Sample Success of Term Structure Models

ABSTRACT
A large literature suggests that standard exchange rate models cannot outperform a random walk
forecast and that the forward rate is not an optimal predictor of the spot rate. However, there is evidence
that the term structure of forward premia contains valuable information for forecasting future spot
exchange rates and that exchange rate dynamics display nonlinearities. This paper proposes a termstructure forecasting model of exchange rates based on a regime-switching vector equilibrium correction
model which is novel in this context. Our model significantly outperforms both a random walk and a
linear term-structure vector equilibrium correction model for four major dollar rates across a range of
horizons.

Introduction

The Meese and Rogo¤ (1983a,b) studies marked a watershed in empirical exchange rate economics. In particular, their robust …nding that standard empirical exchange rate models could not outperform a simple random walk forecast
was at the time seen as devastating.1 Even with the bene…t of twenty years
of hindsight, moreover, the random walk remains the standard comparator for
exchange rate forecasting and models which consistently and signi…cantly outperform a naive random walk are still elusive (e.g. see Mark, 1995). A parallel
…nding in the exchange rate literature, also dating from the early 1980s, was
that the forward rate is not an optimal predictor of the future spot exchange rate
(see e.g. Hansen and Hodrick, 1980; Frankel, 1980; Bilson,1981), or equivalently
that the forward premium is not an optimal predictor of the rate of depreciation, as the e¢cient markets hypothesis, at least in its risk-neutral formulation,
would suggest (see Frankel and Rose, 1995; Taylor, 1995). Attempts to locate
the source of this failure of the risk-neutral e¢cient markets hypothesis either in
the presence of stable, signi…cant and plausible risk premia, or in some sense in
the failure of rational expectations when applied to the foreign exchange market
as a whole, have also met with mixed and very limited success (see Lewis, 1995;
Taylor, 1995). Thus, from the early 1980s onward, exchange rate forecasting
in general became increasingly to be seen as a hazardous occupation, and this
remains largely the case.
A ray of hope in an otherwise murky environment was, however, provided
by Clarida and Taylor (1997), who argued that the failure of the forward rate
optimally to predict the future spot rate did not necessarily imply that forward
rates did not contain valuable information for forecasting future spot exchange
rates. Clarida and Taylor develop what they term an ‘agnostic’ framework for
linking spot rate and forward rate movements without assuming anything at
all speci…c about risk premia or expectations formation except that departures
from the risk-neutral e¢cient markets hypothesis (RNEMH) drive at most a
stationary wedge between forward and expected future spot rates. This is
su¢cient to establish the existence of a linear vector equilibrium correction
model (VECM) for spot and forward exchange rates. Using this framework,
Clarida and Taylor are able to extract su¢cient information from the term
structure of forward premia to outperform the random walk forecast - and a
range of alternative forecasts - for a number of exchange rates in out-of-sample
forecasting. Indeed, at the one-year forecasting horizon, their improvement
over the naive random walk is of the order of 40 percent in terms of root mean
square errors.
Alongside the work on exchange rate forecasting, another strand of the literature has developed in which increasingly strong evidence of nonlinearities of one
sort or another in exchange rate movements has been reported. One element
of this, dating at least to Booth and Glassman (1987), has been the mounting
evidence that the conditional distribution of nominal exchange rate changes is

well described by a mixture of normal distributions and that, consequently, a
Markov switching model may be a logical characterization of exchange rate behavior (e.g. see Engel and Hamilton, 1990; LeBaron, 1992; Engel, 1994; Engel
and Hakkio, 1996; Engel and Kim, 1999). However, although Markov-switching
models …t nominal exchange rate data very well, in general they do not produce
superior forecasts to a random walk or the forward rate on the basis of conventional forecasting criteria (see e.g. Engel, 1994). An exception in this context
is the study by Engel and Hamilton (1990), who apply the Markov-switching
model developed by Hamilton (1988, 1989) to dollar exchange rate data and
show that the model generates better forecasts than a random walk. In the
light of the subsequent literature, however, these forecasting results appear to
be somewhat fragile. Overall, in fact, the literature on nonlinear modelling of
exchange rates has produced models that …t satisfactorily and forecast well in
sample but that in general fail to beat simple random walk models or linear
speci…cations in out-of-sample forecasting (e.g. see Diebold and Nason, 1990;
Engel, 1994; Meese and Rose, 1990, 1991).
In the present paper, we investigate whether allowing for nonlinearities in
the underlying data-generating process for the term structure yields superior
exchange rate forecasts.2 This is done through estimating a fairly general threeregime Markov-switching vector equilibrium correction model (MS-VECM ) for
spot rates and the term structure of forward rates which is essentially based
on an extension of Markovian regime shifts to a nonstationary framework, for
which the underlying econometric theory has recently been developed. Given
the evidence of signi…cant regime-switching behavior in exchange rate movements discussed above, this seems a natural way to extend the Clarida-Taylor
analysis, even though this involves estimating and forecasting from a sophisticated multivariate nonlinear model. Indeed, to the best of the present authors’
knowledge, the research reported in this paper represents the …rst application
of Markov-switching in a multivariate cointegrated framework to exchange rate
modelling and forecasting.
Using weekly data since 1979 for four major dollar exchange rates, we are
able to replicate the Clarida-Taylor forecasting results in a linear VECM framework. However, we also show that conventional linear VECMs reveal signi…cant
residual nonlinearity and are easily rejected when tested against the alternative
of an MS-VECM. Finally, we show that allowing for nonlinearities, using an
MS-VECM, results in forecasts which are signi…cantly superior even to the linear VECM exchange rate forecasts. We thus con…rm that the information
contained in the term structure of forward rates is indeed valuable for forecasting spot exchange rates but that signi…cant improvements can be made over
linear forecasting models by allowing for nonlinearities.
2 The

possibility that their forecasting results might be improved upon through exploiting
a nonlinear framework was anticipated by Clarida and Taylor, who ended their discussion
with the following suggestion: “... in order to establish baseline results, we have restricted
ourselves to a linear framework. Further empirical work might usefully extend the present
analysis to examine nonlinearities” (Clarida and Taylor, 1997, pp. 361-2). It is the purpose
of the present paper to provide exactly this generalization.

The remainder of the paper is set out as follows. In Section 2 we discuss
a general framework for linking spot and forward rates, as a motivation for
our multivariate modelling. In Section 3 we brie‡y set out the econometrics
of Markov-switching multivariate models as applied to nonstationary processes
and cointegrated systems. In the following section we report our empirical
testing, estimation and forecasting results. A …nal section concludes.

2

The information in the term structure of forward exchange premia
h(k)

Let st and ft
be, respectively, the spot exchange rate and the h(k)-period
forward exchange rate, each at time t.3 It is now well documented that nominal
exchange rates between the currencies of the major industrialized economies are
well described by unit root processes. We can therefore write the spot exchange
rate as the sum of two components
st = mt + qt ;

(1)

where mt is a unit-root process evolving as a random walk with drift, and qt
is a stationary process having mean zero and a …nite variance (Beveridge and
Nelson, 1981; Stock and Watson, 1988). If agents are risk-neutral and the
market is e¢cient in the sense that exchange rates fully re‡ect all information
in a given information set -t (so that, in e¤ect, the market conforms to the
h(k)
rational expectations hypothesis) then the forward exchange rate ft
should
predict the h(k)-period ahead future value of the spot exchange rate optimally
given -t : This is the essence of the risk-neutral e¢cient market hypothesis
(RNEMH). There now exists a large literature rejecting the RNEMH, although
it is unclear whether rejection is due to a failure of the assumptions of risk
neutrality or of rational expectations or of both (e.g. see Taylor, 1995).
Following Clarida and Taylor (1997), we may in general de…ne departures
from the RNEMH, due either to the presence of risk premia or to a failure of
rational expectations, or both, as follows:
h(k)

° t ´ ft

¡
¢
¡ E st+h(k) j-t ;

(2)

where E(:j-t ) denotes the mathematical expectation conditional on -t . From
(1) and (2) we can obtain:
h(k)

ft

¡
¢
= ° t + h(k)µ + Et qt+h(k) j-t + mt ;

(3)

3 In our empirical work, we consider forward rates of 4, 13, 26 and 52 weeks maturity, so
that in our notation, h(1) = 4, h(2) = 13, h(3) = 26, and h(4) = 52:

4

where µ is the drift of the random walk process mt : Subtracting (1) from (3),
we achieve an expression for the forward premium at time t:
h(k)

ft

¢
¡
¡ st = ° t + h(k)µ + Et qt+h(k) ¡ qt j-t :

(4)

Equation (4) says that if the departure
from´the RNMEH ° t is stationary,
³
h(k)
given qt » I(1), the forward premium ft
¡ st must also be stationary. This
implies that forward and spot rates exhibit a common stochastic trend and are
cointegrated with cointegrating vector [1; ¡1]. Moreover, since this is true
for any h(k), if we consider the vector of forward rates of tenor h(1) to h(m)
h(1)
h(2)
h(3)
h(m) 0
periods, together with the current spot rate, [st ; ft ; ft ; ft ; ::::ft
],
then this must be cointegrated with m unique cointegrating vectors, each given
by a row of the matrix [¡¶; Im ], where Im is an m-dimensional identity matrix
and ¶ is an m-dimensional column vector of ones. Further, by the Granger
Representation Theorem (Engle and Granger, 1987) the same set of forward and
spot rates must possess a vector equilibrium correction (VECM) representation
in which the term structure of forward premia plays the part of the equilibrium
errors. Clarida and Taylor (1997) exploit this framework and use exactly a
linear VECM representation to demonstrate that a large amount of information
may be extracted from the term structure in order to forecast the spot exchange
rate, even though the forward rate is not an optimal spot rate predictor. Indeed,
dynamic out-of-sample forecasts up to one year ahead indicate that the VECM
is strikingly superior to a range of alternative forecasts, including a random walk
and standard spot-forward regressions.

Markov-switching equilibrium correction

In this section we outline the econometric procedure employed in order to model
regime shifts in the dynamic relationship between spot exchange rates and the
term structure of forward rates. The procedure essentially extends Hamilton’s
(1988, 1989) Markov-switching regime framework to nonstationary systems, allowing us to apply it to cointegrated vector autoregressive (VAR) and VECM
systems (see Krolzig, 1997, 1999).
Consider the following M -regime p-th order Markov-switching vector autoregression (MS(M)-VAR(p)) which allows for regime shifts in the intercept
term:4
yt = º(zt ) +

Pp

i=1 ¦i yt¡i

+ "t ;

(5)

where yt is a K-dimensional observed time series vector, yt = [y1t ; y2t ; : : : ; yKt ]0 ;
º(zt ) = [º 1 (zt ); º 2 (zt ); : : : ; º K (zt )]0 is a K-dimensional column vector of regimedependent intercept terms; the ¦i ’s are K £ K matrices of parameters; "t =
4 Although, for expositional simplicity, this section focuses on equation (5), clearly a more
general formulation of (5) may be considered which allows for all parameters of the model to
be conditioned on the state zt .

["1t ; "2t ; : : : ; "Kt ]0 is a K-dimensional vector of Gaussian white noise processes
with covariance matrix §, "t » NID(0; §). The regime-generating process

P
5
and M
j=1 pij = 1 8i; j 2 f1; : : : ; M g.
A standard case in economics and …nance is that yt is nonstationary but
…rst-di¤erence stationary, i.e. yt » I(1). Then, given yt » I(1), there may be
up to K ¡ 1 linearly independent cointegrating relationships, which represent
the long-run equilibrium of the system, and the equilibrium error (the deviation
from the long-run equilibrium) is measured by the stationary stochastic process
ut = ®0 yt ¡ ¯ (Granger, 1986; Engle and Granger, 1987). If indeed there is
cointegration, the cointegrated MS-VAR (5) implies a Markov-switching vector
equilibrium correction model (MS-VECM) of the form:
Pp¡1
(6)
¢yt = º(zt ) + i=1 ¡i ¢yt¡i + ¦yt¡1 + "t ;
Pp
Pp
where ¡i = ¡ j=i+1 ¦j are matrices of parameters, and ¦ = i=1 ¦i ¡I is the
long-run impact matrix whose rank r determines the number of cointegrating
vectors (e.g. Johansen, 1995; Krolzig, 1999)6 .
Although, for expositional purposes, we have outlined the MS-VECM framework for the case of regime shifts in the intercept alone, shifts may be allowed
for elsewhere. The present application focuses on a multivariate model comprising, for each of the four major dollar exchange rate analyzed, the spot exchange
rate and the forward rates at one month (four weeks), three months (thirteen
weeks), six months (twenty-six weeks) and twelve months (…fty-two weeks) to
h(1)
h(2)
h(3)
h(4)
maturity (hence yt = [st ; ft ; ft ; ft ; ft ]0 = [st ; ft4 ; ft13 ; ft26 ; ft52 ]0 ), for
which, following the reasoning of Section 2, four unique, independent cointegrating relationships should exist. As discussed in Section 4 below, in our
empirical work, after considerable experimentation, we selected a speci…cation
of the MS-VECM which allows for regime shifts in the intercept as well as in
the variance-covariance matrix. This model, the Markov-Switching-InterceptHeteroskedastic-VECM or MSIH-VECM, may be written as follows:
¢yt = v (zt ) +

stationary and non-cointegrated (i.e. r = 0) nor is a stationary vector (i.e. r = K).

An MS-VECM can be estimated using a two-stage maximum likelihood procedure. The …rst stage of this procedure essentially consists of the implementation of the Johansen (1988, 1991) maximum likelihood cointegration procedure
in order to test for the number of cointegrating relationships in the system and
to estimate the cointegration matrix. In fact, in the …rst stage use of the
conventional Johansen procedure is legitimate without modelling the Markovian regime shifts explicitly (see Saikkonen, 1992; Saikkonen and Luukkonen,
1997). The second stage then consists of the implementation of an expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation which yields
estimates of the remaining parameters of the model (Dempster, Laird and Rubin, 1977; Hamilton, 1990; Kim and Nelson, 1999; Krolzig, 1999).
We now turn to a brief discussion of our data set and then to our empirical
analysis.

Empirical results

4.1

Data, unit root tests and cointegration analysis

Our data set comprises weekly observations of spot and 4-, 13-, 26- and 52-week
forward US dollar exchange rates among the G5 countries (dollar-franc, dollarmark, dollar-yen and dollar-sterling) for the period January 7 1979 to December
31 1998, a total of 1,043 observations for each series.7 In our empirical work,
we carried out our estimations over the period January 1979-December 1995,
reserving the last three years of data for out-of-sample forecasting tests.
As a preliminary exercise, we tested for unit root behavior of the spot rate
and the four forward rate time series examined for each of the four dollar exchange rates under investigation by calculating standard augmented DickeyFuller (ADF) test statistics. In each case, the number of lags was chosen such
that no residual autocorrelation was evident in the auxiliary regressions.8 In
keeping with the very large number of studies of unit root behavior for these
time series, we were in each case unable to reject the unit root null hypothesis
at conventional nominal levels of signi…cance. On the other hand, di¤erencing
the series did appear to induce stationarity in each case9 . Hence, the unit root
tests clearly indicate that each of the time series examined is a realization from
a stochastic process integrated of order one, which suggests that testing for
cointegration between st ; ft4 , ft13 , ft26 , and ft52 , is the logical next step.
We then employed the Johansen (1988, 1991) maximum likelihood procedure
in a VAR for yt = [st ; ft4 ; ft13 ; ft26 ; ft52 ]0 and an unrestricted constant term10 . On
7 We

using non-augmented Dickey Fuller tests or augmented Dickey-Fuller tests with
any number of lags in the range from 1 to 12 yielded qualitatively identical results. In addition
to the ADF tests, we also executed Johansen likelihood ratio tests (Johansen, 1988, 1991) with
a ‘univariate VAR’. The results were consistent with the ADF test results.
9 Results not reported but available from the authors upon request.
10 We allowed for a maximum lag length of …ve and chose, for each dollar exchange rate, the
appropriate lag length on the basis of conventional information criteria.
8 Moreover,

7

the basis of the Johansen likelihood ratio test statistics for cointegrating rank
(based on the maximal eigenvalue and on the trace of the stochastic matrix), we
could strongly reject the hypothesis of three independent cointegrating vectors
against the alternative of four, but were not able to reject the hypothesis of exactly four cointegrating vectors for each exchange rate examined at conventional
nominal test sizes.11
In order to identify the cointegrating vectors uniquely, we then imposed
and tested the over-identifying restrictions on the ¯ 0 matrix of cointegrating
coe¢cients suggested by the framework discussed in Section 2:

As the results reported in Table 1 clearly show, for each currency examined
these restrictions were in fact rejected by the data. While these rejections are
clearly statistically signi…cant, we proceeded to examine whether the departures
from the null hypothesis were large by imposing the following exactly-identifying
restrictions:

where the Ái parameters are unrestricted. This yielded the results reported in
Table 2. The results suggest that, consistent with the recent studies by Naka
and Whitney (1995) and Luintel and Paudyal (1998), that the departure from
the overidentifying restrictions, although statistically signi…cant at conventional
test sizes, is actually very small in magnitude. Indeed all of the estimated
Ái coe¢cients, except for the last two cointegrating relationships obtained on
French and German data, are in the range between 0:98 and 1:04 and, therefore,
very close indeed to the theoretical value of 1. Thus, rejection of the hypothesis
H0 : Ái = 1 8i may be due to tiny departures from the null hypothesis (due, for
example, to tiny data imperfections) which are not economically signi…cant, but
which appear as statistically signi…cant given our very large sample size.12 The
framework we discussed in Section 2 provides strong economic priors in favor
11 The choice of exactly four independent cointegrating vectors was also strongly suggested
by the Hansen-Johansen (1993) recursive procedure for the cointegrating rank. The cointegration test statistics are not reported here in order to conserve space, but are available from
the authors on request.
12 Leamer (1978, chapter 4) points out that classical hypothesis testing will lead to rejection
of any null hypothesis with a su¢ciently large sample: ‘Classical hypothesis testing at a …xed

8

of the unity restrictions. Moreover, given that we know that covered interest
parity holds strongly among Eurodeposit interest rates (Taylor, 1987, 1989),
coe¢cients di¤erent from unity would imply a unit root in international interest
rate di¤erentials which seems highly implausible for the countries considered.13
Given this reasoning, we report below results obtained with the unity restrictions
imposed.14

4.2

Linearity testing and MS-VECM estimation results

We next estimated a standard linear VECM using full-information maximum
likelihood (FIML) methods:
¢yt = º +

Pp¡1
i=1

¡i ¢yt¡i + ¦yt¡1 + ut

(10)

where yt = [st ; ft4 ; ft13 ; ft26 ; ft52 ]0 , assuming p = 5 as suggested by both the
Akaike Information Criterion, the Schwartz Information Criterion and the HannanQuinn Criterion. Employing the conventional general-to-speci…c procedure, we
obtained fairly parsimonious models for each exchange rate with no signi…cant
residual serial correlation.15 We then applied two fairly general linearity tests
to the residuals from the estimated linear VECMs, namely Ramsey’s (1969) RESET test and the Brock, Dechert and Sheinkman (BDS) (1991) test for testing
the null hypothesis that the residuals from (10) are independent and identically
distributed (iid) against an unspeci…ed alternative.16 Application of both of
level of signi…cance increasingly distorts the interpretation of the data against a null hypothesis
as the sample size grows. The signi…cance level should consequently be a decreasing function
of sample size,’ (p. 114). See also Berkson (1938).
13 Moreover, standard univariate unit root tests to each of the forward premium series (i.e.
with the unity restrictions imposed) suggested in every case that the forward premium is
stationary.
14 We did, however, execute all of the empirical analysis discussed below without imposing
the unity restrictions and using instead the estimates of the cointegrating parameters reported
in Table 2. The results were quantitatively extremely similar (virtually identical) and qualitatively identical to those reported below, which is not suprising given that the estimated
parameters are very close to unity.
15 Full details on these estimation results are available from the authors upon request, but
are not reported to conserve space and because we mainly focus on nonlinearities and their
e¤ect on forecasting in this paper.
16 The BDS test for a series u is calculated in the following way.
Let ut;v be a set of
t
consecutive terms from ut : ut;v fut ; ut+1 ; : : : ; ut+v¡1 g. The pair of vectors ut;v and us;v
are said to be no more than & apart if j ut+j ¡ us+j j· & for j = 0; 1; : : : ; v ¡ 1. Thus,
the correlation integral Cv (&) is de…ned as the product of the limit of T ¡2 (T being the
number of observations) times the number of &-close pairs (s; t), essentially measuring the
probability that the pairs of points (s; t) are within & of each other. The BDS statistic is then
bv (&) ¡ [C
b1 (&)]v for some v and &. Under the null hypothesis that ut
constructed
as S(v; &) = C
p
is iid, T [S(v; &)] » N(0; »), where the variance » is a function of v and &. Rejection of the
null implies that some form of nonlinearity is present in ut , although the type of nonlinearity
cannot be exactly determined under the BDS test. BDS (1991) suggest that the choice of
v and, particularly, the choice of &, are crucial for the power of the test, which is reasonably
powerful only in large samples. BDS (1991) also suggest values of & between 0.5 and 1.5
times the standard deviation of ut , whereas the value of v should preferably be such that
(T =v) > 200.

9

these tests provided very strong empirical evidence that the linear VECM fails
to capture important nonlinearities in the data generating process, as linearity is
rejected with marginal signi…cance levels (p-values) of virtually zero (see Table
3).17
We then proceeded to investigate the presence of nonlinearities further through
the estimation of a fairly general Markov-switching model of the form:
X
£
¤ p¡1
¢yt ¡ ± (zt ) = ® ¯ 0 yt¡1 ¡ ¹ (zt ) +
¡i [¢yt¡i ¡ ± (zt )] + !t ;

(11)

i=1

where yt = [st ; ft4 ; ft13 ; ft26 ; ft52 ]0 , ± (zt ) is the (5 £ 1) regime-dependent vector
of means of the short-run dynamics, and ¹ (zt ) is the (4 £ 1) regime-dependent
vector of means of the long-run equilibrium relationships.
Next we applied the conventional ‘bottom-up’ procedure designed to detect
Markovian shifts in order to select the most adequate characterization of an Mregime p-th order MS-VECM for ¢yt 18 . The VARMA representations of the
time series suggested in each case that the number of regimes was in the range
between two and three. The linearity test indicates in each case the rejection
of the linear VECM in favor of a nonlinear alternative model (see Table A1 in
the Appendix).
However, for any MS-VECM estimated the implicit assumption that the
regime shifts a¤ect only the intercept term of the VECM was found to be inappropriate. In fact, we checked the relevance of conditional homoskedasticity
by estimating an MS-VECM where the Gaussian innovation is allowed to be
regime-dependent, "t » N ID(0; §(zt )). We then tested the hypothesis of no
regime dependence in the variance-covariance matrix using a likelihood ratio
(LR) test of the type suggested by Krolzig (1997, p. 135-6), in addition to constructing an LR test for the null hypothesis of no regime dependent intercept.
The results (see Table A1 of the Appendix) indicated very strong rejection of the
null of no regime dependence, clearly suggesting that an MS-VECM that allows
for shifts in both the intercept and the variance-covariance matrix, namely an
MSIH-VECM(p), is the most appropriate model within its class in the present
application. Further in the same spirit of the test for regime-conditional homoskedasticity, we executed a test in order to select the most parsimonious
VECM appropriately representing the dynamic relationship between spot and
forward exchange rates. In particular, we tested the null of MSIH-VECM(1)
against the alternative of MSIH-VECM(p) and, as may be seen in Table A1
17 We also discuss below how the forecasting performance of the linear VECM is inferior to
that of an MS-VECM.
18 Essentially, the bottom-up procedure consists of starting with a simple but statistically
reliable Markov-switching model by restricting the e¤ects of regime shifts on a limited number
of parameters and checking the model against alternatives. In such a procedure, most of the
structure contained in the data is not attributed to regime shifts, but explained by observable
variables, consistent with the general-to-speci…c approach to econometric modelling. For a
comprehensive discussion of the bottom-up procedure, see Krolzig (1997).

10

(Appendix), for all currencies examined, we were not able to reject this null
hypothesis at standard signi…cance levels.
Finally, in order to discriminate between models allowing for two regimes
against models governed by three regimes we also constructed the upper bound
LR test of Davies (1977, 1987). The results produced (see Table A1, last
column) very large statistics, suggesting that three regimes may be appropriate
in all cases.19 Therefore, in spite of parsimony considerations, we allowed for
three regimes in our MS-VECM.
As stressed in some recent contributions20 , it is instructive to note that
model (11), where the regime shifts occur in the drift of the VECM as well
as the equilibrium mean of the cointegration relationships, can be equivalently
represented by means of an MSI-VECM21 . Hence, the …nal result of the procedure identi…es in all countries an MS-VECM model governed by three di¤erent
regimes that can be written as follows:

¢yt = v (zt ) + ¦yt¡1 +

p¡1
X

¡i ¢yt¡i + !t ;

(12)

i=1

where ¦ = ®¯ 0 , ! t » N IID(0; §(zt )) and zt = 1; 2; 3. In Table A2 of the Appendix, we report the …nal MSIH-VECM estimation results for each of France,
Germany, Japan and the UK. With few exceptions, the estimation yields fairly
plausible estimates of the coe¢cients for the VECMs estimated, including the
adjustment coe¢cients in ®, which were generally found to be strongly statistically signi…cantly di¤erent from zero.22 , 23
19 It is important to note here that the regularity conditions under which the Davies (1977,
1987) test is valid are violated, since the Markov model has both a problem of nuisance
parameters and a problem of ‘zero score’ under the null hypothesis. Moreover, even if the
Davies bound suggested by Krolzig is appropriate, it is possible that it will only be valid if
the null model is a linear model with iid errors; in the present case, it is di¢cult to believe
that this condition is met since exchange rate innovations are not homoskedastic, which would
induce some distortion. Therefore, the distribution of the LR test is likely to di¤er from the
adjusted Â2 distribution proposed by Davies (1977, 1987), and this is why we do not report
marginal signi…cance levels for the LR tests. For extensive discussions of the problems related
to LR testing in this context, see Hansen (1992, 1996) and Garcia (1998). See Garcia and
Perron (1996) for an empirical application. We are thankful to Bruce Hansen for clarifying
several econometric issues related to LR testing in the present paper.
20 See, for example, Krolzig (1997) and the references therein.
21 In order to recognize the shifts in the drift of the VECM separately from the ones occurring
in the long-term equilibrium mean, consistent with the standard theoretical literature on
multiple cointegrated time series, it is possible to decompose the shifts in the intercept term
¡
¢¡1 0
v (zt ) into changes in the drift of the system ± (zt ) = ¯ ? ®0? ¯ ?
®? v (zt ) (? denoting the
orthogonal complement) and the equilibrium mean ¹ (st ) = ¡ (¯ 0 ®)¡1 [¯ 0 v (zt )].
22 Investigation of the estimated smoothed transition probabilities (not reported to conserve
space) for the di¤erent regimes indicated that, in general, for each country, the three regimes
seem to be important in that they characterize a substantial fraction of the joint movements
of the spot exchange rates as well as the term structure of forward rates, with each regime
being somewhat persistent but with a rather large number of switches over the sample. Also,
regime identi…cation seems to be mainly driven by the frequent shifts in the conditional
variance rather than the ones involving the intercept of the MSIH-VECM.
23 We also looked at graphs of standardized residuals, the smoothed residuals and the one-

Forecasting spot exchange rates out-of-sample with
the MSIH-VECM

The procedure we have applied so far allowed us to achieve a reliable estimation
of the dynamic relationship between spot exchange rates and the whole term
structure of forward premia. The exercise conducted by Clarida and Taylor
(1997) showed that the term structure of forward rates, embedding a larger
information set than a single forward rate, is able to predict the dynamics of
the spot exchange rate out-of-sample with a higher precision achieving average
gains of 40% at long horizons with respect to the random walk benchmark model
(in terms of root mean square errors).
In order to assess the usefulness of our nonlinear VECM characterization
of the term structure, dynamic out-of-sample forecasts of the spot rate were
constructed using the MSIH(3)-VECM(1) estimated and described in the previous section. In particular we performed forecasting exercises on the period
January 1996- December 1998 with forecast horizons up to 52 weeks ahead.24
The out-of-sample forecasts for a given horizon j = 1; : : : ; 52 are constructed
according to the recursive procedure described in Clarida and Taylor (1993),
namely conditional only upon information up to the data of the forecast and
with successive re-estimation as the date on which forecasts are conditioned
moves through the data set.
It is well known in the literature that forecasting with nonlinear models
raises special problems.25 We therefore adopt a very general forecasting procedure based on Monte Carlo integration which is capable of producing forecasts
virtually identical to the analytical forecasts for a wide range of models. In
particular, we forecast the path for st+j for j = 1; : : : ; 52 using Monte Carlo
simulations calibrated on the estimated MSIH-VECMs reported in Table A2 in
the Appendix. The vector of Gaussian innovations is set consistent with the
covariance matrices given in Panel B) of Table A2. The simulation procedure
is repeated with identical random numbers 10; 000 times and the average of the
10; 000 realizations of the sequence of forecasts is taken as the point forecast.
Since we use a large number of simulations, by the Law of Large Numbers this
procedure should produce results virtually identical to those which would result
step prediction errors from each estimated MSIH-VECM. The di¤erence is concerned with
the weighting of the residuals. Loosely speaking, the smoothed residuals are the closest to the
sample residuals from a linear regression model; however, they overestimate the explanatory
power of the Markov-switching model due to the use of the full-sample information covered in
the smoothed regime vector. The standardized residuals are conditional residuals. The onestep prediction errors are based on the predicted regime probabilities. Unfortunately, many
conventional diagnostic tests, such as standard residual serial correlation tests, may not have
their conventional asymptotic distribution when the residuals come from Markov-switching
models and are therefore not reported here. However, the graphs of standardized residuals,
the smoothed residuals and the one-step prediction errors provided no visual evidence of
residual serial correlation in any of the residuals series plotted. See, for example, Krolzig
(1997) for a discussion of residual-based model checking in this context.
24 For a description of the procedure of out-of-sample forecasting in a Markov-switching
framework, see Hamilton (1993, 1994). See also Franses and van Dijk (2000).
25 See Brown and Mariano (1984, 1989) and, for a general discussion, Granger and Terasvirta

from calculating the exact forecast analytically (Gallant, Rossi and Tauchen,
1993; Brown and Mariano, 1984, 1989; Granger and Terasvirta, 1993, Chapter
8; Franses and van Dijk, 2000, Chapters 3-4).
Forecast accuracy is evaluated using absolute and square error criteria, namely
the mean absolute error or MAE, the mean square error or MSE, and the root
mean square error or RMSE. We compared the forecasts produced by the MSIHVECM to the forecasts generated by a simple random walk benchmark as well
as the forecasts generated by the linear term-structure VECM originally proposed by Clarida and Taylor (1997). Further, in order to assess the accuracy of
forecasts derived from two di¤erent models we employ the Diebold and Mariano
(1995) test:

DM = q

d
2¼fb(0)
T

(13)

where d is an average (over T observations) of a general loss di¤erential function
and fb(0) is a consistent estimate of the spectral density of the loss di¤erential
function at frequency zero. Diebold and Mariano show that the DM statistic
is distributed as standard normal under the null hypothesis of equal forecast
accuracy. Consistent with a large literature (see, inter alia, Mark, 1995; Kilian,
1999; Kilian and Taylor, 2000) the loss di¤erential function we consider is the
di¤erence between the (absolute and square) forecast errors. A consistent
estimate of the spectral density at frequency zero fb(0) is obtained using the
method of Newey and West (1987) where the optimal truncation lag has been
selected using the Andrews (1991) AR(1) rule.26
Several problems may arise using DM statistics in small sample as well as
taking into account parameter uncertainty (see also West, 1996; West and McCracken, 1998; and McCracken, 2000). In our case, where we are dealing
with nested competing forecasting models - one of which is nonlinear - and
with multi-step-ahead forecasts, the asymptotic distribution of the DM statistic is non-standard and unknown. Therefore, the marginal signi…cance levels
reported below should be interpreted with caution.27
26 The rule is implemented as follows: we estimated an AR(1) model to the quantity d
t
obtaining the autocorrelation coe¢cient b
½ and the innovation variance from the AR(1) process
¾
b 2 : Then the optimal truncation lag A for the Parzen window in the Newey-West estimator is
h
i 1=5
given by the Andrews rule A = 2:6614 b
³ (2) T
where b
³ (2) is a function of b
½ and ¾
b 2 . The

Parzen window minimizes the mean square error of the estimator (Gallant, 1987, p. 534).
27 Clark and McCracken (2001) derive the asymptotic distributions of two standard tests
in this context for one-step-ahead forecasts from nested linear models. Their results are,
unfortunately, not directly applicable to our case because we are dealing with multi-stepahead forecasts from nested models, and because one of the competing models is a Markovswitching model. Therefore, our case is one for which the asymptotic theory of the DM
statistic is unknown at the present time. A possible solution involves calculating the marginal
signi…cance levels by bootstrap methods using a variant of the bootstrap procedure proposed
by Kilian (1999) and Kilian and Taylor (2001), although this procedure is computationally
very demanding and it is unknown whether it is valid in the context of MSIH-VECMs.

13

Table 4 gives detailed results of the accuracy of the forecasts for the dollarfranc, dollar-mark, dollar-sterling and dollar-yen systems respectively, using
MAE, MSE and RMSE criteria for forecast accuracy. The results provide evidence in favor of the predictive superiority of the MSIH-VECM models against
the naive random walk and against linear VECM models. Comparing our results to those obtained using the pure random walk we can see that, across
criteria and across countries, the MSIH-VECM models give very much more
accurate forecasts. At the 4-week horizon we achieve average improvements
ranging between 24% and 26% across currencies and accuracy criteria, while at
the 52-week horizon we obtain average improvements ranging between 43% and
76% with a maximum reduction of 90% in the case of dollar-yen. The statistical
signi…cance of these results is con…rmed executing the DM test, although the
marginal signi…cance levels reported should be treated with caution in the light
of our earlier discussion on the asymptotic properties of the DM statistic in the
present context.28
These results extend the …ndings of Clarida and Taylor (1997) who, using a
linear VECM framework for the term structure of forward foreign exchange premia, were able to provide out-of-sample forecasts of spot exchange rates which
were superior to alternative conventional forecasting methods. By explicitly incorporating nonlinearity into the modelling framework, we have in the present
analysis been able to improve upon the Clarida-Taylor results even further and
in all cases and in almost all the time horizons we are able to improve the forecasting performance of the linear VECM models. In particular, the gains that
we obtained relative to the linear VECMs range on average, across criteria and
across currencies, between 1-11% (4 weeks) and 13%-46% (52 weeks).

Conclusion

In this paper we have reported what we believe to be the …rst analysis of spot
and forward exchange rates in a multivariate Markov-switching framework, and
in particular we have applied that framework to exchange rate forecasting. Our
research was inspired by encouraging results previously reported in the literature
on the presence of nonlinearities (and particularly by the success of Markovswitching models) in the context of exchange rate modelling, as well as by the
relative forecasting success of the ‘agnostic’ linear VECM model of the term
structure of forward premia.
Using weekly data on spot and forward dollar exchange rates for the G5
countries over the period January 1979 through December 1995, we found strong
evidence of the presence of nonlinearities in the term structure, which appeared
to be modelled well by a multivariate three-regime Markov-switching VECM
that allows for shifts in both the intercept and in the covariance structure. We
then used this model to forecast dynamically out of sample over the period
28 Note that the MSIH-VECM for dollar-sterling is, in general, the model which performs
worse in forecasting.

14

January 1996 through to December 1998. The forecasting results were impressive. The MS-VECM forecasts were found to be strongly superior to the
random walk forecasts at a range of forecasting horizons up to 52 weeks ahead,
using standard forecasting accuracy criteria and on the basis of standard tests
of signi…cance. Moreover, the nonlinear VECM strongly outperformed a linear
VECM for spot and forward rates in out-of-sample forecasting of the spot rate
for all exchange rates and horizons. In forecasts of the dollar-yen, for example,
the MS-VECM forecasts were approximately sixty percent better than the linear
VECM forecasts, and ninety percent better than the random walk forecasts.
In this research, we have been primarily concerned with providing sound
models of exchange rate forecasting and have therefore adopted an ‘agnostic’
approach both with respect to the sources of underlying departures from the
risk-neutral e¢cient markets hypothesis and in the sources of the underlying
nonlinearities. Further research might, therefore, usefully analyze the sources
of these nonlinearities further and attempt to improve on the parametric nonlinear formulation proposed in this paper. Possible extensions include the allowance for di¤erent equilibrium correction terms (speeds of adjustment towards
equilibrium) in di¤erent regimes, and the endogeneization of the probability of
switching from one regime to another, which might, for example, be made a
function of macroeconomic fundamentals.
With regard to the evaluation of forecasting models, although the relevant
literature has traditionally focused on accuracy evaluations based on point forecasts, several authors have recently emphasized the importance of evaluating
the forecast accuracy of economic models on the basis of density - as opposed
to point - forecasting performance (see, inter alia, Diebold, Gunther and Tay,
1998; Granger and Pesaran, 1999; Tay and Wallis, 2000; Timmerman, 2000; Pesaran and Skouras, 2001). Especially when evaluating nonlinear models, which
are capable of producing highly non-normal forecast densities, it would seem
appropriate to consider a model’s density forecasting performance. This is an
immediate avenue for future research.
Given the di¢culty in beating random walk forecasts using fundamentalsbased models - …rst highlighted by Meese and Rogo¤ (1983a,b) - as well as the
well-known failure of the forward rate optimally to predict the future spot rate,
the evidence provided by our results that the term structure of forward rates
is powerful in forecasting spot exchange rates is rather striking. In particular,
it seems that, notwithstanding the failure of the simple (risk-neutral) e¢cient
markets hypothesis in this context, forward rates may contain more useful information to forecast spot exchange rates than do conventional fundamentals.
It seems plausible that important microstructural e¤ects may be responsible for
this phenomenon, as argued, for example, by Evans and Lyons (1999)29 , Lyons
29 Evans and Lyons (1999) provide a model which sheds light on the role of order ‡ow in
determining exchange rates. In their model, order ‡ow is a proximate determinant of price.
Using data on signed order ‡ow from the Reuters dealing system, Evans and Lyons …nd
that order ‡ow is a signi…cant determinant of some major bilateral exchange rates, obtaining
coe¢cients of determination signi…cantly larger than the ones usually obtained using standard
macroeconomic models of nominal exchange rates. Evans and Lyons also show that their

incremental information remains an important challenge in the research agenda.
model of daily exchange rate changes produces good out-of-sample forecasts at short horizons,
beating the alternative of a random walk model in standard measures of forecast accuracy.

Notes: The RESET test statistics were computed considering an alternative
model with a quadratic and a cubic term; they are distributed as F (2; T ¡ m ¡
3) under the null hypothesis of linearity (no misspeci…cation), where T is the
number of observations and m is the number of regressors (inclusive of the
intercept). The BDS test statistic tests the null hypothesis that a series is iid
against the alternative of a realization from an unspeci…ed nonlinear process,
as described in the text. The critical values, from the normal distribution, are
1:960 and 2:576 at the …ve percent and one percent nominal levels of signi…cance
respectively. Given that the choices of v and & are crucial for the power of the
test, we report the results for di¤erent plausible values of v and &, as suggested
by BDS (1991) and explained in the text; ¾u is the standard deviation of the
residuals from the linear VECM (10). For both RESET tests and BDS tests,
only p-values are reported.

Notes: MSVECM, RW and VECM are the average level of the (absolute or
square) forecast error obtained by the MSIH-VECM, Random Walk and linear
VECM respectively. The forecast errors are obtained by recursive estimation
of out-of-sample dynamic forecast up to k = 4; 13; 26; 52 steps ahead over the
period 1996:1-1998:52. DM1(A) is the Diebold-Mariano statistic comparing
the forecast errors of the MSIH-VECM model with the ones obtained by a
driftless Random Walk. DM2(A) is the Diebold-Mariano statistic comparing
the forecast errors of the MSIH-VECM model with the ones obtained by the
linear VECM. A is the optimal truncation lag constructed according to the
AR(1) Andrews (1991) rule. For the Diebold and Mariano’s statistics only
p¡values are reported. 0 indicates p¡values below 10-100 , which are considered
as virtually zero.

Notes: LR1 is a test statistic of the null hypothesis of no regime dependent variance-covariance matrix (ie. MSI(M )-VECM(p) versus MSIH(M )VECM(p)). LR2 tests the null hypothesis that the model having autoregressive
component of order one is equivalent to another with a higher autoregressive
order (i.e. MS(M)-VECM(1) versus MS(M)-VECM(p)). Both tests are constructed as 2(ln L¤ ¡ ln L), where L¤ and L represent the unconstrained and
the constrained maximum likelihood respectively. Those tests are distributed
as Â2 (g) where g is the number of restrictions imposed. Davies is the upper
bound of the likelihood ratio test where the model is not identi…ed under the
null hypothesis due to the existance of nuisance parameters. In this case it
tests the null hypothesis that the model with two regimes is equivalent to the
model with three regimes. Figures in braces denote p¡values, and {0} indicates
p¡values below 10-100 , which are considered as virtually zero.

LR linearity test: 2430.01
Notes: Tildes denote estimated values obtained using the EM algorithm
for maximum likelihood (Dempster, Laird and Rubin, 1977). Figures in parentheses are asymptotic standard errors. Symbols are de…ned as in equation (12).
P and » denote the M £ M transition matrix and the M -dimensional ergodic
probabilities vector respectively. ½ (A) is the spectral radius of the matrix A
calculated as in Karlsen (1990). It can be tought as a measure of stationarity
of the MS-VECM. The LR linearity test is a Davies (1987)-type test testing the
hypothesis that the true model is a linear VECM against the alternative of an
MSIH-VECM.

½ (A) = 0:1876
LR linearity test: 2090.66
Notes: Tildes denote estimated values obtained using the EM algorithm
for maximum likelihood (Dempster, Laird and Rubin, 1977). Figures in parentheses are asymptotic standard errors. Symbols are de…ned as in equation (12).
P and » denote the M £ M transition matrix and the M -dimensional ergodic
probabilities vector respectively. ½ (A) is the spectral radius of the matrix A
calculated as in Karlsen (1990). It can be tought as a measure of stationarity
of the MS-VECM. The LR linearity test is a Davies (1987)-type test testing the
hypothesis that the true model is a linear VECM against the alternative of an
MSIH-VECM.
