ABSTRACT
In this article, we show how to analyze analytically the equilibrium policies and prices in an
economy with a stochastic investment opportunity set and incomplete financial markets, when agents
have power utility over both intermediate consumption and terminal wealth, and face portfolio
constraints. The exact local comparative statics and approximate but analytical expression for the
portfolio policy and asset prices are obtained by developing a method based on perturbation analysis to
expand around the solution for an investor with log utility. We then use this method to study a general
equilibrium exchange economy with multiple agents who differ in their degree of risk aversion and face
borrowing constraints. We characterize explicitly the consumption and portfolio policies and also the
properties of asset returns. We find that the volatility of stock returns increases with the cross-sectional
dispersion of risk aversion, with the cross-sectional dispersion in portfolio holdings, and with the
relaxation of the constraint on borrowing. Moreover, tightening the borrowing constraint lowers the riskfree interest rate and raises the equity premium in equilibrium.

Introduction

Merton (1969, 1971) shows that in an environment where investment opportunities vary over time,
investors optimizing over a single period will choose portfolios that are diﬀerent from investors
optimizing over multiple periods. This is because the optimal intertemporal portfolio is not necessarily instantaneously mean-variance eﬃcient, but also provides a hedge against future shifts in
the investment opportunity set.1 However, these papers do not indicate how one can obtain explicit solutions: in the dynamic programming formulation of Merton, obtaining an explicit solution
requires one to solve a nonlinear partial diﬀerential equation for which a closed-form solution is
typically not available.
To obtain explicit solutions to the non-linear diﬀerential equation characterizing the intertemporal portfolio problem, research building on the work of Merton has proceeded in three directions.
One strand—for example, Liu (1998) and Wachter (1998) in partial equilibrium and Wang (1996)
in general equilibrium—assumes that ﬁnancial markets are complete, and then uses the martingale
technique of Cox and Huang (1989) to determine the optimal consumption and portfolio rules in
two distinct steps: ﬁrst, consumption is identiﬁed by solving a static optimization problem, and
then the optimal portfolio rules are obtained by solving a linear diﬀerential equation. A second
strand—for instance, Kim and Omberg (1996) and Liu (1998)—assumes that investors derive utility
only from terminal wealth and not from intermediate consumption, which is one of the sources of
the non-linearity in the diﬀerential equation. Then, under a particular speciﬁcation of the investment opportunity set, this assumption allows them to solve the dynamic programming equation in
closed form. A third approach, developed by Campbell (1993), allows for intermediate consumption and incomplete ﬁnancial markets, but chooses a convenient speciﬁcation for the evolution of
the investment opportunity set, and then makes appropriate approximations in order to overcome
the non-linearity of the problem.2 Thus, the ﬁrst approach needs to make restrictive assumptions
about the structure of ﬁnancial markets, while the other two approaches work only for particular
speciﬁcations for the evolution of the investment opportunity set; moreover, all three approaches
1

The static and dynamic portfolios will coincide only under speciﬁc conditions for the utility function (unit risk
aversion) or asset returns (independence between changes in the investment opportunity and asset returns). Results
in the empirical literature suggest that it is unlikely that either condition is true; a discussion of this literature is in
Campbell and Viceira (1999).
2
For models set in discrete time one needs to log-linearize the budget equation and the ﬁrst-order conditions, and
for models set in continuous time one needs to log-linearize the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.

are not suitable when there are constraints on portfolio positions.
This article contributes to the literature on portfolio choice and asset pricing in two ways. First,
we develop a method to analyze analytically the equilibrium policies and prices in an economy with
a stochastic investment opportunity set and incomplete ﬁnancial markets, when agents have power
utility over both intermediate consumption and terminal wealth. This method can be applied
to characterize portfolio policies in partial-equilibrium models where the risk-free interest rate,
the expected stock return and the volatility of stock returns can change over time. This method
can also be used to study general equilibrium economies with portfolio constraints when there
are multiple investors who diﬀer in their risk aversion, and hence, the investment opportunity set
evolves endogenously.
Our second contribution is to apply this method to a particular general equilibrium setting in
order to understand the eﬀect on asset prices of portfolio constraints and of heterogeneity. We
study a general equilibrium exchange economy with an arbitrary number of agents who diﬀer
in their degree of risk aversion and face borrowing constraints. Our main ﬁndings are that the
volatility of stock returns increases with the cross-sectional dispersion of risk aversion, with the
cross-sectional dispersion of portfolio holdings, and as one relaxes the constraint on borrowing.
Moreover, tightening the borrowing constraint lowers the risk-free interest rate and raises the
equity premium in equilibrium.
Our analytical characterization of portfolio policies and prices in economies with an arbitrary
number of agents, who diﬀer in their risk aversion and face borrowing constraints, extends the
analysis of a production economy in Dumas (1989) and of an exchange economy in Wang (1996).
In contrast to our work, both these papers assume that ﬁnancial markets are complete and do
not consider the case of portfolio constraints; moreover, the model in Dumas can be solved only
numerically even when there are only two agents, while Wang can solve for only some of the
quantities of the model in closed form and even this is possible only for particular permutations of
the number of agents and the degree of risk aversion for each of these agents.
Several papers study economies in which agents have heterogeneous preferences in the presence
of portfolio constraints. Cuoco (1997) characterizes the risk premium in an economy where agents
diﬀer with respect to their risk aversion face portfolio constraints. Detemple and Murthy (1997)

Risk aversion and optimal portfolio policies

also study a heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium model with portfolio constraints where the
heterogeneity arises from diﬀerences in beliefs rather than diﬀerences in risk aversion (all agents
have log utility); they show that some of their results on pricing would extend to an economy where
agents diﬀer in risk aversion, but do not provide an explicit characterization of optimal policies.
Marcet and Singleton (1999) use simulation methods to analyze an economy where agents face
borrowing constraints and diﬀer with respect to their labor income and risk aversion. In contrast
to these papers, we provide an explicit characterization in terms of exogenous variables for the
consumption and portfolio policies, the riskless rate and the stock price, and also for the mean and
volatility of stock returns.
Identifying the equilibrium in multiagent economies with incomplete ﬁnancial markets is a
diﬃcult problem and to date the literature does not have an explicit general characterization in
terms of exogenous variables. Cuoco and He (1994a,b) show that with incomplete markets one can
still construct a representative agent, but in this case the weights assigned to individual agents in
this aggregation evolve stochastically. However, their characterization of equilibrium is in terms of
endogenous variables. Our approach can be viewed as a convenient way of expressing the solution
in terms of the primitives in economies where ﬁnancial markets are incomplete and agents diﬀer in
their degree of risk aversion.
Our method relies on asymptotic analysis, which allows one to obtain in closed-form the approximate (asymptotic) expressions for portfolio and consumption policies. The basic idea of asymptotic
methods is to formulate a general problem, ﬁnd a particular case that has a known solution, and use
this as a starting point for computing the solution to nearby problems. In the context of portfolio
problems, the solution for the investor with log utility (with unit risk aversion) provides a convenient starting point for the expansion. We need to emphasize, though, that while our method allows
for exact comparative statics results around the case of log utility, it provides only approximations
to the portfolio rules and asset prices, and thus, it should be viewed as being complementary to
numerical methods rather than a substitute. While the asymptotic solution is designed to provide a
local approximation (for risk aversion close to unity), general theoretical results on the magnitude
of the approximation error are currently not available—see Judd (1996, 1998, Ch. 13–15) for a
discussion of these issues. However, there are a number of methods to evaluate the quality of the
approximate solution numerically (for instance, see Den Haan and Marcet, 1994, and Judd, 1996

Risk aversion and optimal portfolio policies

4

and 1998) that can also be applied to the portfolio problems considered here.
The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, we describe the method for analyzing
portfolio decisions in the context of an arbitrary vector process driving investment opportunities.
In Section 3, we apply this method to a particular general equilibrium exchange economy where
investors vary in their degree of risk aversion and face leverage constraints. We conclude in Section 4. The main results of each section are highlighted in propositions and the proofs for all the
propositions are collected in the appendix.

An asymptotic approach to consumption and portfolio choice

In this section, we undertake an asymptotic analysis of a model of consumption and portfolio selection with a stochastic investment opportunity set, when the agent derives utility from intermediate
consumption and bequest, and faces constraints on her portfolio position. We show that one can obtain an explicit asymptotic expression for the solution of the intertemporal consumption-portfolio
problem, as long as the value function of the analogous problem for the agent with logarithmic
preferences is known in closed form.
The section is structured as follows. We start by describing a partial-equilibrium economy with
an arbitrary stochastic vector process for the state variables that drives changes in the investment
opportunity set. Following this, we ﬁrst derive the consumption and portfolio rules in the absence
of constraints and then consider the eﬀect of constraints on portfolio positions. We conclude by
discussing how these results can be extended to a general equilibrium setting.

2.1

The economy

In this section, we describe the features of the model: the preferences of agents, the ﬁnancial assets
that they can choose to hold, and the stochastic nature of the investment opportunity set.

Financial assets

The agent can allocate her wealth to two assets: a short-term riskless asset (bond) with rate of
return rt , and a stock (paying zero dividend).3 The price of the stock, Pt , evolves according to
dPt

where µP t is the instantaneous expected return and σP t is the volatility. Our convention is to
denote stochastic variables with a subscript “t”; thus, in the above speciﬁcation, the riskless rate,
rt , the expected return on the stock, µP t , and the volatility of stock returns, σP t , are permitted to
be stochastic.

2.1.3

The investment opportunity set

The investment opportunity set is described by the vector of state variables, Xt . The state vector
is assumed to change over time according to

(Xt ) · dZXt ,
dXt = µX (Xt ) dt + σX

where the covariance between the stock returns process and the state vector process is denoted by
σP X . With the above speciﬁcation, the riskless rate and the expected rate of return and volatility

implying that the instantaneous market price of risk is also stochastic:

where the second line is obtained by using (4).
In general, the unknown function g (X, t) cannot be computed in closed form. Our approach
is to obtain an asymptotic approximation to g (X, t), where the expansion is with respect to the
risk aversion parameter, γ. In order to use our results also in a general equilibrium setting with
multiple agents who diﬀer in their risk aversion, we deﬁne γ ≡  a, where a is used to index agent
types so that diﬀerences in a lead to diﬀerences in risk aversion, while the parameter  allows us
to set the magnitude of these diﬀerences. With the above speciﬁcation, we look for g (X, t) as a
power series in :
 
g (X, t) = g0 (X, t) +  g1 (X, t) + O 2 ,

(6)

where g0 (X, t) is obtained from the value function of an agent with logarithmic utility ( = 0):
J (W, X, t) = A(t) ln W (t) + g0 (X, t) .
Note that the ﬁrst-order asymptotic expansions are suﬃcient to obtain exact local comparative
statics results for the dependence of the optimal policies on the risk aversion parameter. The
asymptotic expansions will also approximate the optimal consumption and portfolio policies when
the risk aversion parameter γ is suﬃciently close to zero (that is, when  is close to zero).
We now derive the asymptotic expansions for the consumption-portfolio problem (by substituting (6) into (5)) and explain how one can obtain the function g0 (X, t). Following this, we examine
the comparative statics properties of the optimal policies.

The two expressions for the portfolio weight, (8) and (9), are equally easy to manipulate. The
role of the risk aversion coeﬃcient is more apparent in (9), while (8) retains the exact form of the
myopic portfolio demand, expanding only the hedging demand.
Comparing the asymptotic weight in (8) to the exact one in (5), we see that the only diﬀerence
is that under the standard approach one needs to identify the unknown function g(X, t), while in
our approach one needs to identify only g0 (X, t), the value function for the log investor. It is much
easier to solve for the value function of the log investor. The intuition for this is well-known:4 the
substitution eﬀect and the income eﬀect arising from a change in the investment opportunity set
are of exactly the same magnitude and opposite sign for an investor with log utility. Consequently,
this investor has zero demand for hedging future changes in the investment opportunity set, and
so her portfolio coincides with the myopic portfolio. Similarly, log-utility investors do not adjust
their consumption-wealth ratio for changes in the investment opportunity set, and so it is easy to
identify this ratio as a deterministic function of time, 1/A(t). As long as the function g0 (X, t) is
known in closed form, one can obtain explicit ﬁrst-order asymptotic expressions for the optimal
4
Early results on the properties of the log utility function are in Leland (1968) and Mossin (1968). These results
were developed further in Hakansson (1971) and Merton (1971).

consumption and portfolio policies. For example, the class of aﬃne processes will yield closed-form
solutions.
Analyzing the consumption-portfolio rules given in Proposition 2.1, we see that the zero-order
components of these expansions correspond to the well-known solution for the case where the agent
has a logarithmic utility function ( = 0): the optimal consumption-wealth ratio, c ≡ C/W , is given
by the deterministic function 1/A(t), and the optimal portfolio policy is myopic and independent of
changes in the investment opportunity set. The ﬁrst-order terms capture the eﬀect of risk aversion
when the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion deviates from one ( deviates from zero). In particular,
one can interpret the expression for the optimal portfolio in (8) as

hedging demand

where the ﬁrst bracketed term represents the portfolio weights under constant investment opportunity set, the myopic demand, and the second term characterizes the demand arising from the
desire to hedge against changes in the investment opportunity set. The important thing to note in
the above expression is that it relies on g0 , which can be determined explicitly, rather than on g,
which cannot be identiﬁed generally.
The equation above allows one to obtain the intuitive comparative static results: the hedging
demand is asymptotically proportional to the risk aversion parameter and vanishes as  approaches
zero. The hedging demand is also proportional to the scalar product of the vector of “betas” of the
state variables with respect to the risky asset, σP−2 σP X , and the “delta” of the function g0 (X, t)
with respect to the state vector, ∂g0 (X, t) /∂X. Finally, the equation shows that the hedging
demand is zero when the shocks to the state variables are uncorrelated with the returns on the
stock (σP X = 0).
The asymptotic expansions (7) and (9) approximate the optimal consumption and portfolio
policies when the risk aversion parameter  is suﬃciently close to zero. They also provide exact
local comparative static results for the dependence of the optimal policies on the risk aversion

Equation (11) indicates that the optimal position in the risky asset can either increase or decrease
with the risk aversion coeﬃcient, depending on the magnitude of the second term in equation (11),
which is the sensitivity of the hedging demand with respect to the parameter .
Inﬁnite-horizon economies are a special case of the general formulation of the previous section.
Because of the importance of inﬁnite-horizon models, we present the result for this case below as a
separate proposition, which can be obtained from Proposition 2.1 by setting ψ = 1 and taking the

Consumption and portfolio policies in the presence of portfolio constraints

Up to this point, it had been assumed that the agent’s consumption-portfolio choice was unconstrained. We now extend the analysis to allow for constraints on the portfolio weights. To simplify

11

Risk aversion and optimal portfolio policies

the exposition, we analyze only the inﬁnite-horizon problem explicitly. It should be clear from our
presentation how the solution of the ﬁnite-horizon problem in Proposition 2.1 must be modiﬁed to
account for constraints.
We consider constraints of the form that restrict the portfolio weight on the risky asset to lie
between a lower and an upper bound:
π (X) ≤ π (X) ≤ π (X) ,
where these bounds are allowed to depend on the state of the economy. Other than allowing for
state-dependence, this speciﬁcation of portfolio constraints is a specialization of the formulation in
Cvitanic and Karatzas (1992) to the case of one risky asset. By restricting our attention to the
constraint on portfolio proportions, we are ruling out more general types of constraints, e.g., the
constraints on the absolute amount invested in each asset (see Grossman and Vila (1992), Cuoco
(1997)).

The function g0c (X) in (14), where the superscript “c” indicates the presence of constraints,

maximizer subject to the same portfolio constraints and the same investment opportunity set as
the investor with (non-log) power utility function.
As in the unconstrained case, an explicit asymptotic expression for the optimal consumption
and portfolio policies is available as long as the solution of the analogous problem for the agent
with the logarithmic utility function is known in closed form.

2.4

Consumption and portfolio policies in general equilibrium

The results in Propositions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 can be used as building blocks in the analysis of
a broad range of models. In particular, they allow one to obtain asymptotic expressions for the
prices of assets in equilibrium economies that otherwise can only be studied numerically. Successful
application of our results is possible as long as it is possible to obtain explicit solutions for agents
with logarithmic utility functions. In that case, the asymptotic demand functions, equations (7) and
(8) for the ﬁnite-horizon case or (12) and (13) for the inﬁnite-horizon case, are known in closed form
and for equilibrium models the asset prices can be determined from the market clearing conditions.
We now explain how the results of the previous section can be used to analyze heterogeneousagent economies, and in the next section we study a particular application. Speciﬁcally, consider
an inﬁnite-horizon economy populated by heterogeneous agents, each with power utility function.
Recall that γ ≡  a, where diﬀerences in a lead to diﬀerences in risk aversion, while  controls the
magnitude of these diﬀerences. In such an economy the investment opportunity set depends on the
cross-sectional distribution of wealth among the agents, as well as on the exogenous state variables
and the small parameter . Thus, the expanded state vector is given by
Xt = {X0t , {Wt (a)}} ,

13

Risk aversion and optimal portfolio policies

where X0t denotes the vector of exogenous state variables and {Wt (a)} is the set of individual
wealth values for the agents in the economy.
Because the moments of returns on ﬁnancial assets explicitly depend on , we can approximate
them by an asymptotic power series. Speciﬁcally, a moment of returns mt can be expressed as
mt = m(Xt , ) = m0 (X0t ) +  m1 (Xt ) + O(2 ).

(17)

The leading term in the expansion coincides with the corresponding moment in an economy with
 = 0, i.e., in a homogeneous-agent economy with log-utility maximizing agents. This implies that
m0 depends only on the exogenous state vector X0t .
Next, consider the term g0 (X, ) in the value function of the log-utility maximizer in our
heterogeneous-agent economy. Since the moments of returns depend on , so does the function
g0 , according to Proposition 2.2. Thus,
g0 (X, ) = g0,0 (X0 ) +  g0,1 (X) + O(2 ).

(18)

The leading term g0,0 corresponds to the value function in the homogeneous-agent economy with
log-utility maximizing agents and hence does not depend on the wealth distribution.
We can now use Proposition 2.2 to obtain asymptotic expansions for the individual portfolio
policies in a heterogeneous-agent economy.

Proposition 2.4 The optimal consumption and portfolio policies in a heterogenous-agent economy
are given by:
 
c (X) = ρ −  aρ g0,0 (X0 ) − ln ρ + O 2 ,

+ O 2 .

where g0,0 is given in (18).

Thus, to obtain a valid asymptotic expansion of the consumption and portfolio policies in a
general equilibrium economy one simply has to replace the function g0 in Proposition 2.2 with it’s
leading term g0,0 . This greatly simpliﬁes computation of the equilibrium, because the function g0,0

Risk aversion and optimal portfolio policies

corresponds to the value function of the log investor in a homogeneous economy, and therefore, can
be obtained without solving for the equilibrium in the heterogeneous economy. In the next section,
we show how one can use the method developed above to analyze a heterogenous-agent economy
in the presence of portfolio constraints.

A general equilibrium exchange economy

In this section, we study an exchange (endowment) economy with multiple agents who diﬀer in
their level of risk aversion.5 Wang (1996) analyzes this economy for the case where there are two
agents who do not face any portfolio constraints.6 We extend the analysis of Wang in several
directions. First, we show how one can characterize the equilibrium for the case where there is
an arbitrary number of agents. In contrast to Wang, we also obtain closed-form (asymptotic)
expressions for the mean and volatility of the stock return process. This analysis allows us to relate
the volatility of stock returns to the heterogeneity of investors in their degree of risk aversion and
to the cross-sectional dispersion in stock holdings.
Second, in Section 3.2, we introduce a leverage constraint that restricts how much investors
can borrow to lever their investment in the stock. The model can no longer be solved using the
representative-agent approach used in Wang (1996). We use the asymptotic approach to characterize the equilibrium in the presence of constraints, ﬁrst for the case where there are only two agents,
and then for the case where there is a continuum of agents. We then analyze the relation between
the constraint on leverage and the volatility of stock returns, and also the interaction between the
leverage constraint and heterogeneity across investors.

3.1

The economy with unconstrained agents

We assume that there are two assets available for trading in the economy. The ﬁrst asset is a
short-term risk-free bond, available in zero net supply, which pays the interest rate rt that will
be determined in equilibrium. The second asset is a stock, which is a claim on the aggregate
5
We report only the analysis of the exchange economy considered in Wang (1996); the analysis of the production
economy studied in Dumas (1989), with the addition of portfolio constraints, can be obtained from the authors.
6
Wang (1996) also discusses how the model could be solved when there are up to 4 agents, each having a particular
value for the risk aversion parameter; with more than 4 agents a closed-form solution is not available for general wealth
distributions.

endowment, et , that evolves according to
det = µe et dt + σe et dZet ,
where µe and σe are constant parameters. We assume that the growth rate of the endowment is
positive, µe − σe2 /2 > 0. The cumulative stock return process is
dPt + et dt
= µRt dt + σRt dZt ,
Pt

(19)

with µRt and σRt to be determined in equilibrium.
Assume that agents in the economy diﬀer in their degree of risk aversion, γ(a) =  a. Without
loss of generality, assume that there is a single agent of each type a. Let Wt (a) be the wealth

of the individual agent, a Wt (a) is the aggregate wealth in the economy, which is also equal to

the value of the stock market, Pt , and ωt (a) ≡ Wt (a)/ a Wt (a). The investment opportunity set
depends on the cross-sectional distribution of wealth across agents, and thus, the correspondence
with the general formulation in Section 2 is that Xt = {Wt (a)}. If  were equal to zero, then all
the agents would have logarithmic preferences. As a result, they would hold the same portfolio and
their wealth would be perfectly correlated; in this case, the cross-sectional distribution of wealth in
the economy would be constant over time.

3.1.1

Individual policies

We start by identifying the value function of an agent in an economy where  = 0 (that is, all
agents have log utility). In such an economy, the value function of a representative agent equals

Thus,

Equilibrium

The equilibrium in this economy is deﬁned by the stock price process, Pt , the interest rate process

assets, the consumption and portfolio choices are optimal for the agents, (ii) the goods market and
the markets for the stock and the bond clear.

(29)

Observe that the ﬁrst moment of stock returns in (25) can be computed only up to order O(2 )
terms because we know Pt /et only up to O(2 ) terms. However, the second moment, given in
equation (26), is known to higher order. Based on this, we have the following result.
Proposition 3.2 Asymptotically, the volatility of stock returns is increasing in the cross-sectional
heterogeneity of risk aversion.
To understand the intuition behind this result, consider the equilibrium stock price (24). The
price-dividend ratio is decreasing in average risk aversion. This is because the expected stock return
is increasing in average risk aversion, as shown in (25). Moreover, the average risk aversion in the
economy ﬂuctuates over time in response to the aggregate endowment shocks. According to (21),
agents with relatively high risk aversion are less exposed to the stock market risk. Therefore, the
fraction of total wealth controlled by agents with higher-than-average risk aversion declines as the
stock market rises, as shown in (29). As a result, the average risk aversion in the economy is
negatively aﬀected by the aggregate endowment shocks, implying a positive eﬀect on the pricedividend ratio.7 The positive impact of the endowment shocks on the price-dividend ratio increases
7

Chan and Kogan (2001) discuss the countercyclical nature of expected stock returns due to investor heterogeneity
in a setting were individuals have catching-up-with-the-Joneses preferences. Our setting uses a more common speciﬁcation of individual preferences, but the same intuition for time-variation in expected returns applies in both cases.
While Chan and Kogan rely on numerical analysis and focus on the dynamics of conditional moments of stock returns, we derive an explicit asymptotic relation between the level of return volatility and the degree of cross-sectional
heterogeneity.

18

Risk aversion and optimal portfolio policies

the volatility of stock returns. Because the outlined eﬀect is due to the cross-sectional diﬀerences in
investors’ risk aversion, it comes as no surprise that its magnitude is related to the cross-sectional
dispersion of individual types, as captured by (26).
Given individual risk aversion coeﬃcients are not directly observable, it is useful to re-state
Proposition 3.2 in terms of individual portfolio choices. Because vara [πt (a)] = 2 vara [a] + O(3 ),
there exists a positive linear asymptotic relation between the volatility of stock returns and the
cross-sectional dispersion of individual portfolio holdings.

3.1.3

Comparison with the exact solution

In order to demonstrate that the analytical results described above capture the salient qualitative
features of the exact solution, we solve numerically the unconstrained model for the case where there
are only two agents. Based on the exact solution obtained numerically, we present in Figure 1 the
parametric plots showing the relation between the cross-sectional dispersion of portfolio holdings
(vara [π(a)]) and the conditional volatility of stock returns (scaled by the volatility of endowment
process). There are four plots, each for a diﬀerent degree of heterogeneity across the two investors,
which is given by the parameter . The solid line in each plot corresponds to the asymptotic solution
while the dashed line is for the exact numerical solution.
Consistent with our analytic asymptotic results, all four plots show that the volatility of stock
returns tends to increase with the cross-sectional dispersion of portfolio holdings. Given the nature
of the asymptotic expansions we are using, it is not surprising to ﬁnd that the asymptotic solution
is closer to the exact solution in the ﬁrst three plots, where the degree of heterogeneity in the
economy is smaller ( closer to zero) and investors have risk aversion closer to unity, relative to
the fourth plot, where  is much further away from zero. Nevertheless, even in the latter case the
relation between return volatility and cross-sectional dispersion is positive.

3.2

The economy with portfolio constraints

Now, assume that agents are restricted in the amount they can borrow in order to lever up their
investment in the stock. In particular, individual portfolio positions must satisfy:
πt ≤ 1 +  L.

19

Risk aversion and optimal portfolio policies

Observe that we specify the limit on borrowing, L, to be proportional to the small parameter .
This is because the equilibrium portfolio policies in the unconstrained economy, as given by Proposition 3.1, imply that the amount of borrowing by individual agents is proportional to ; therefore,
in order for the leverage constraint to have an impact for small values of the small parameter, it
must be suﬃciently tight, i.e., formally, it must be proportional to  as well.
In the presence of the leverage constraint, based on Proposition 2.3 the individual portfolio
policies take the form
!
πt (a) = min (1 +  a) φt , 1 +  L + O(2 )
= 1 +  min [a + φ1t , L] + O(2 ),
where the market price of risk is expanded as φt = 1 +  φ1t + O(2 ).8 We will say that the leverage
constraint is binding for an agent of type a when b + φ1t ≥ L.

3.2.1

Equilibrium in the constrained economy with two agents

We start by considering the case where there are only two classes of agents, a and a , with a < a .

In this region:

is asymptotically positive, because ωt (a )(a − a ) − L ≥ 0 whenever the leverage constraint is binding. The expected stock return is asymptotically unaﬀected, according to (30). Thus, tightening
the leverage constraint increases the equilibrium equity premium, µRt − rt .9
9
Heaton and Lucas (1996) observe similar behavior of asset returns in their incomplete-market model in response
to an increased diﬀerence in borrowing and lending rates. Their analysis relies on numerical simulations and the
intuition behind their results is diﬀerent. In their model, individuals have the same risk aversion but face idiosyncratic
endowment shocks. As a result, an increase in trading costs raises individual consumption variability, and hence,
lowers the risk-free rate of return due to the demand for precautionary savings.

Risk aversion and optimal portfolio policies

21

We now explain the intuition for this result. Start by considering the situation where trading
in the stock is not allowed in equilibrium. Then, one class of agents would borrow to increase their
current consumption, thereby reducing the growth rate of their consumption. Hence, imposing
the borrowing constraint would reduce current consumption and increase the consumption growth
rate of the constrained agent while reducing the growth rate for the unconstrained agent. This
would lower the equilibrium interest rate, which is linked to the consumption growth rate of the
unconstrained agent.
Now, consider the situation where agents can trade also the risky asset. This complicates
matters in general. Intuitively, holding the asset price processes ﬁxed, adding the leverage constraint
reduces the aggregate demand for the risk free asset, which suggests that tightening the leverage
constraint would result in a lower interest rate in equilibrium. However, this argument ignores
the potential impact of the constraint on stock returns. We ﬁnd that the leverage constraint has
only a higher-order eﬀect on the moments of stock returns in our model, as can be seen from
comparing Propositions 3.1 and 3.3. To understand the reason for this, note that the stock price
is determined by market clearing for the consumption good, and the consumption policy (the
consumption to wealth ratio) itself is aﬀected by the leverage constraint only through its eﬀect
on the investment opportunity set. Because the consumption policy of investors with logarithmic
preferences is independent of the investment opportunity set, for agents with utility functions
close to logarithmic, the impact of changes in the investment opportunity set on the consumption
policy is of order  (see Proposition 2.3). Moreover, the time-varying component of the investment
opportunity set is itself of order  in equilibrium, since the economy is perturbed around the
logarithmic representative agent case where the investment opportunities are constant over time.
Therefore, these two eﬀects imply that the impact of the leverage constraint on consumption policies
is of order 2 (see Proposition 2.4). Thus, the constraint has only a second-order eﬀect on the
equilibrium price-dividend ratio and the moments of stock returns.
The above argument explains the impact of the leverage constraint on the risk-free rate and the
equity premium in our model. We summarize these observations in the following proposition.

Proposition 3.4 Asymptotically, the interest rate in the constrained economy is lowered and the
equity premium is increased by tightening the borrowing constraint.

22

Risk aversion and optimal portfolio policies

Next, we relate the volatility of stock returns to the leverage constraint and compare it to the
volatility in the unconstrained economy.

Proposition 3.5 Asymptotically, the volatility of stock returns in the constrained economy is lower
than in the unconstrained economy:

economy respectively. Moreover, the volatility of stock returns is reduced by tightening the borrowing
constraint.

As we argued above, the volatility of stock returns is positively related to the variability of the
average risk aversion in the economy. The leverage constraint reduces the cross-sectional diﬀerences
in individual portfolio holdings, and hence, the variability of the cross-sectional wealth distribution
and the average risk aversion. As a result, the constraint on borrowing lowers the volatility of stock
returns.

3.2.2

The economy with portfolio constraints and a continuum of agents

In the previous section, we found that constraints on leverage lower the volatility of stock returns.
We carried out our analysis for the special case of only two types of agents. In this section, we
extend this result to an economy with a continuum of agents.
Assume that agents have risk aversion between −â and +â, with an arbitrary wealth distribution, ωt (a). Then, market clearing in the stock market implies

Conclusion

In this article, we have provided an asymptotic analysis of the optimal consumption and portfolio
decisions of an investor who has preferences over intermediate consumption and faces an economic
environment with stochastic investment opportunities and portfolio constraints. Our results include
comparative statics results for optimal policies and analytic asymptotic expressions for equilibrium
asset prices. In addition to the analysis of the portfolio policy of a single agent, we have shown
how the portfolio-choice problem in the presence of a stochastic investment opportunity set can
be embedded in a general equilibrium setting, even when there are multiple investors who diﬀer
in their degree of risk aversion and face constraints on their portfolio positions. Throughout our
analysis, we have not needed to rely on the assumption that ﬁnancial markets are complete.
The model developed in the paper can be extended in several directions. For instance, we
have assumed that agents have time-additive power utility rather than the more general recursive
preferences described in Kreps and Porteus (1978) and Duﬃe and Epstein (1992). Given that log
utility is a special case also of the Kreps-Porteus speciﬁcation of recursive utility, it is possible to
extend the asymptotic method to the case of recursive preferences. Similarly, the method can also
be applied to an economy where agents exhibit habit-persistence. Moreover, the general equilibrium
model studied in the paper is of an exchange economy but the method applies also to a production
economy.
One limitation of the analysis we have presented is that it applies only to those situations where
there exists a closed-form solution for an investor with logarithmic utility. However, even when an
explicit solution does not exist for the log investor, one may apply asymptotic analysis, but with
the perturbation now being around a parameter diﬀerent from that governing risk aversion.

eliminating terms of order two and higher.

Proof of Proposition 2.3
As in Proposition 2.2, this result follows by replacing the function g(X) in the expression for the
optimal consumption-portfolio policy with its asymptotic expansion. Only the leading term in
the expansion must be retained, which corresponds to the solution of the log-utility maximizer’s
problem.

where π0 (Xt ) is the optimal portfolio policy of the log-utility maximizer, given by (16). Repeating
the steps of the proof of Proposition 2.2 we obtain the desired result.

Proof of Proposition 2.4
Substituting the expansions (17) and (18) into the expression for the consumption policy and
portfolio weights in Proposition 2.2, and eliminating the higher-order terms, yields the result.

πt (a) = 1 +  (a − Ea [a]) + O(2 ).
To derive the process for stock returns in terms of exogenous variables, and to determine the
higher-order terms in the asymptotic expansions of the moments of the return process, we start by
describing the evolution of Wt (a):
dWt (a)
Wt (a)

=

!
πt (a)(µRt − rt ) + rt − ct (a) dt + πt (a)σRt dZt

Proof of Proposition 3.2
The result follows from diﬀerentiating the expression for the volatility of stock returns in (26) with
respect to vara [a].

Proof of Proposition 3.3
The introduction of portfolio constraints changes equation (27) and onwards, but because equations
(24) and (25) are based on (20), these results are still valid.

Since the ﬁrst-order terms in expansions of the mean and the volatility of stock returns are
not aﬀected by the leverage constraint, this implies that asymptotically the interest rate in the
constrained economy is lowered and the equity premium is increased by tightening the borrowing
constraint.
Now, we compute the volatility of the returns process:

Figure 1: Volatility of stock returns in a heterogeneous economy
The ratio of the conditional volatility of stock returns to the volatility of the endowment process, σRt /σe , is plotted against the cross-sectional variance of portfolio holdings, vara [π(a)].
The solid line corresponds to the analytical asymptotic solution, the dashed line is computed numerically. The following parameter values are used: µe = .02, σe = .03, ρ = .02.
There are two types of agents in the economy, a = 0 and a = 1. The small parameter 
takes values of .5, −.5, −1, and −4.
