Area Differences in Utilization of Medical Care and Mortality Among U.S. Elderly
Victor R. Fuchs, Mark McClellan and Jonathan Skinner
NBER Working Paper No. 8628
December 2001
JEL No. I11

ABSTRACT
This paper examines 313 U.S. areas for differences in medical care utilization and mortality of
whites ages 65-84 in 1990. The variables included in the analysis are education, real income, cigarette
sales, obesity, air pollution, percent black, and dummy variables for seven regions and five population
size categories from MSAs over 500,000 to not in MSA.
Utilization, especially inpatient care, is strongly positively related to mortality. Mortality is
positively related to cigarette sales, obesity, air pollution and percent black. Utilization (especially
outpatient) is significantly higher in MSAs with populations greater than 500,000. Mortality does not
vary with population size, with or without controls. Florida is an outlier for both utilization (very high)
and mortality (by far the lowest of any region). The puzzles of Floridian exceptionalism and the positive
relation between white mortality and percent black are discussed but not resolved.

I. Introduction
The two most important, most enduring questions in health economics are: (1) What are
the determinants of expenditures? (2) What are the determinants of health? Extensive research
over the last 35 years has produced a variety of answers to these questions, depending in large
part on the specific context within which the questions are posed. One crucial distinction is
between explaining changes over time and explaining cross-sectional differences at a given time.
With regard to secular changes in the U.S. in recent decades, most health economists now
believe that advances in medical technology provide the major explanation for both increases in
expenditures and improvements in health.1 With regard to cross-sectional differences, the focus
of this paper, there is less agreement. By exploiting a rich body of data from the Center for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly HCFA), the U.S. Census of Population, and other
sources, we hope to narrow that disagreement, at least with respect to area differences in
utilization of care and mortality of the elderly.
Our focus on the elderly is motivated in part by the fact that they account for a
disproportionate share of national health care expenditures and an even greater share of
government health care expenditures. Moreover, the elderly experience the bulk of the major
health problems of the population. Approximately one-half of all deaths occur between ages 6584, and another one-fourth occur at ages 85 and above. These shares are based on the current age
distribution of the U.S. population. For a stationary population experiencing current age-specific
mortality rates, deaths at ages 65-84 would still account for almost one-half the total; the share at
85 and above would rise to one-third. The focus on the elderly is facilitated by the fact that the
Medicare program generates a large, detailed body of data on utilization and mortality.

3

One reason for focusing on area differences is that the large number of metropolitan and
non-metropolitan areas in the U.S. provides a convenient framework for aggregating individual
data in the search for variables that may be related to utilization and mortality. Moreover, many
health policy analysts believe that an understanding of area differences may suggest opportunities
to limit expenditures and/or improve health (e.g., Wennberg, Fisher, and Skinner, 2001).
This paper has two main sections: utilization and mortality. In most markets an interest
in expenditures would require attention to prices as well as quantities, but given universal
insurance coverage through Medicare and administrative price setting by HCFA, utilization is a
natural subject for study. Mortality is only one of many possible measures of health, but there
are several reasons to concentrate on it. First, mortality is by far the most objective measure.
Secondly, it is, for most people, the most important health outcome. Thirdly, it is probably
significantly correlated with morbidity since most deaths are preceded by illness.
In this paper we focus on “whites”, ages 65-84, or more specifically, those not identified
as African-American. We exclude blacks because at those ages both utilization and mortality of
blacks are higher than for whites and the percentage black in an area is correlated with other
variables of interest. Moreover, preliminary research by Donald Nichols suggests that the
relationship between those other variables and utilization and mortality may be significantly
different for blacks than for whites. We exclude anyone 85 and over because it is more difficult
to obtain accurate measures for self-reported variables such as education and income. About
one-half the population 85 and over suffer from some form of dementia and about one-fifth are in
nursing homes where measurement of income is particularly problematic. Moreover, most
nursing home utilization is not covered by Medicare, the source of our data on utilization.
4

Briefly, we find wide variation in the utilization of health services across regions. It is
not simply that some regions are higher along all dimensions of care, but that in some regions
(Florida, for example) there is much more diagnostic testing, even while per capita inpatient
services are comparable to the national average. In general, utilization is strongly positively
associated with mortality across areas - in other words, areas with more sick elderly use more
health care, other things equal. There remains, however, substantial variation in utilization after
controlling for factors such as education, income, and mortality.
Cross-area variations in mortality rates among this elderly group are not as large as
variations in utilization, but they are still substantial. The 10 percent of MSAs with the highest
mortality (age-sex adjusted) have an average death rate 38 percent greater than the 10 percent of
MSAs with the lowest mortality. The comparable differential between the high and low
utilization areas is 49 percent.
Education, real income, cigarettes, obesity, air pollution, and the percent black account
for more than half of the variation in mortality across areas, but there is still substantial
differences across regions unexplained by these variables. Florida, in particular, has death rates
significantly below the national average; the differential is particularly large for areas in the
southern portion of the state. The final section of the paper explores two puzzles revealed by
regression analyses: (1) Why Florida is so different from the rest of the country with respect to
utilization and mortality; and (2) Why the presence of more blacks in an area should be
associated with higher mortality among elderly whites. We considered several possible solutions
to these puzzles, including differential migration patterns of the elderly, but ultimately we are left
with conjectures rather than robust explanations.

II. Previous Studies
Spatial Variations in Health Care Utilization
There is an extensive literature on geographic variations in health care spending and how
it might be explained; we consider here a selective overview of these studies.
Researchers have documented variations across regions in health care utilization
beginning with the studies by Glover in the 1930s, the work by Wennberg and associates in the
1970s and 1980s, and more recent studies by a wide variety of researchers.2 There is a general
consensus that the variations are real and persistent over time. The Dartmouth Atlas of Health
Care provides extensive documentation of the differences across regions for a variety of
utilization measures (Wennberg and Cooper, 1999). In the Atlas studies, regions are defined
based on Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs), each of which has at least one hospital with a
tertiary cardiovascular or neurological surgical center. The geographical boundary of the HRR is
based on the migration patterns of Medicare patients who use the hospitals inside the HRR, of
which there are 306 in the U.S. Average 1995-96 fee-for-service Medicare per capita
expenditures ranged from $3,506 in Eugene, Oregon, $3,700 in Minneapolis, $7,783 in Miami,
to $9,033 in McAllen, Texas; these are all adjusted for age, sex, race, and regional price
differences using a variant of the Part B price adjuster. Utilization rates of specific interventions
that are not subject to the difficulties of price adjustment also show dramatic variations across
regions. These differences are therefore best thought of as differences in quantities – hospital
admissions, physician visits, and procedures – for the enrollees who live in each region,
6

regardless of where they actually get their care.
Most of the controversy comes in how these variations can be interpreted. One clear
possibility is factors related to demand; a sicker population, for example, should lead to greater
demand for health care. Health status is clearly a critical determinant of health care utilization.
Average annual spending for Medicare beneficiaries with "poor" self-assessed health is $8743,
but only $1656 for those in excellent health (Wennberg and Cooper, 1996).
While regional differences in health status are clearly important determinants of health
care spending (as we demonstrate below), they do not fully explain the two-fold differences in
Medicare spending across regions. Even after accounting for differences across regions in
underlying health measures such as stroke, heart attacks, hip fractures, cancer incidence, income,
poverty rates, and behavioral factors such as the percentage of smokers and seatbelt users, one
cannot explain more than 42 percent of the overall variation across regions in expenditures
(Skinner and Fisher, 1997; Skinner, Fisher, and Wennberg, 2001). Longitudinal cohort studies
also reveal differences in resource use across both hospitals and regions after controlling for
patient health status and function (Chau, Fisher, and Skinner, 2001).3
A related “demand” based explanation is that patient preferences (owing to unmeasured
illness or preferences for care holding illness constant) determine health care utilization, so that
health care resources move to areas with the greatest demand as measured by initial physician
visits or other indicators such as health (Escarce, 1992; Escarce, 1993; Folland and Stano, 1989;
Green and Becker, 1994). In many of these studies, demand is inferred by the frequency of initial
visits to the physician (as opposed to subsequent referrals, which are viewed as supply-driven). It
remains an interesting, and largely untested question as to whether visits to physicians reflect
7

demand (patient preferences) or supply (how often the physician schedules office visits).
Clearly, these demand-related factors can potentially explain some of the variation we observe,
particularly in Florida where rates of utilization are higher than the rest of the country.
Another explanation is based on the supply of health care resources. The earliest
incarnation of this link is “Roemer’s Law,” which states that if a hospital bed is built, it will be
filled. In this view, the pre-existing resource capacity of the area, which arose out of historical
accident, in turn determines the intensity of care in the region. In regions with greater supplies of
hospital beds, inpatient expenditures are higher. A similar story holds for physician supply;
larger populations of physicians per capita are associated with higher levels of per capita
physician expenditures (Wennberg and Cooper, 1996, 1999).
However, correlation does not establish causation. One could expect more hospital beds
to be built where there is greater demand, and one would expect physicians to move to regions
where the demand of physician services is high. Furthermore, the correlations are not very
strong. For example, using Dartmouth Atlas data, just one-quarter of the variation in Part B
(physician) expenditures across the U.S. can be explained by physician supply. And while the
supply of specialists in Miami is 45 percent higher than the supply in Minnesota, the number of
visits by specialists to people in their last six months of life in Miami is more than 4 times larger.
In other words, there appear to be significant nonlinearities in treatment patterns across regions
that cannot be explained solely by differences in resource supply.
Another hypothesis, closely related to Wennberg’s “practice style” theory is that some
physicians show greater “enthusiasm” for specific procedures (Wennberg, Barnes, and Zubkoff,
1982; Chassin, 1993). A recent study surveyed both orthopedic surgeons and referring
8

physicians with regard to their propensity to perform surgery (in the former case) and their
perceptions of outcomes and propensity to refer (in the latter case), and found that these factors
were highly significant in explaining overall knee replacement rates in the population, even after
controlling for the underlying clinical conditions of the patients (Wright et al, 1999). The study
did not, however, test patient preferences conditional on health needs.
A number of studies seeking to explain physician behavior have examined associations
between specific physician psychosocial attributes or physician training or practice characteristics
(years in practice, diversity of diagnoses managed, specialty) and measures of utilization
(Allison, et al, 1998; Franks et al, 2000; Pearson et al., 1995; Selby et al, 1999). Although
associations were generally weak, physicians with greater fear of malpractice, anxiety due to
uncertainty, and less willingness to take risks were more likely to spend more per patient or more
likely to refer. However, the magnitudes of these differences are not large enough to explain, by
themselves, the wide regional variation in utilization.
As a statistical proposition, differences in physician enthusiasm by themselves are not
enough to generate regional variations. Most regions include a large number of physicians, and if
physicians are endowed with differing but randomly distributed levels of enthusiasm, they would
average out over the large number of physicians in the area. (Of course, for some surgical
procedures, one or two specialists could exert a strong influence on regional rates.) The
interesting question therefore is why enthusiasm should be correlated across physicians within a
given region.
Finally, factors that operate at the level of the hospital and market are also known to
influence spending. Teaching status, membership in multi-hospital chains, degree of
9

competition, and hospital ownership (e.g. for-profit ownership) have all been associated with
differences in resource use (Gray and McNerney, 1986; Kessler and McClellan, 1999; Silverman,
Skinner, and Fisher, 1999; Taylor, Whellan, and Sloan, 1999). The extent to which these factors
contribute to regional differences in spending is not well understood.
Spatial Variations in Mortality
Spatial variations in mortality have not been studied as extensively as variations in
utilization, and many studies have focused heavily on the influence of one or two variables such
as air pollution or income inequality. The earliest investigations typically used states or a limited
number of MSAs as the units of observation, thus suffering from the problem of few degrees of
freedom. (Auster, Leveson, Sarachek, 1969, Morris Silver, 1972) Considerable effort has been
devoted to studying the effects of income and education, and to sorting out the relative
importance of these closely related variables. Both variables are usually found to be related to
mortality, but their importance can vary greatly with age and cause of death. Income, for
instance, is much more highly correlated with infant mortality than with deaths at other ages.
Attempts to discover the impact of medical care have produced mixed results (FuchsKramer, 1972; Hadley 1988). More recently, Skinner, Fisher, and Wennberg (2001) used as an
instrument physician visits in the last six months. This geographical variable was highly
correlated with overall Medicare expenditures but uncorrelated with predicted survival based on
regional measures of health. This study found “flat of the curve” effects of Medicare
expenditures on survival, at least for the expenditures explained by physician visits in the last six
months. Similar results were found using cohort data of heart attack patients controlling for
detailed chart data using the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project data (Fisher et al, 2001).
10

Several studies have found a positive association between air pollution and mortality.4
More recently, numerous investigators have focused on income inequality (rather than low
income per se) as a major cause of higher mortality.5 In two comprehensive reviews of this
literature Deaton (2001) and Deaton and Paxson (1999) critique the theoretical foundations of
these studies and their empirical implementations. Deaton’s attempts to find evidence of a
relation between income inequality and mortality give no support to this popular hypothesis
(Deaton and Paxson (2001) and Deaton and Lubotsky (2001)).

III. Data and Estimation Strategy
In this paper utilization is measured using a weighted index of quantities of services. We
adopt this approach, instead of using Medicare expenditures, because it sidesteps the difficult
problem of deflating Medicare expenditures across regions to “undo” differential payments made
by Medicare for the same service in different areas. These differentials are introduced to offset
differences in costs experienced by the providers of care and for other reasons. Deflated
expenditures are also problematic to the extent that the residents of an area receive services in
another area. In such cases, the price index of the area of residence is not the appropriate
deflator.6
We count the number of specific services received by the resident of an area, regardless
of the area where the services were provided. Each detailed service is then weighted by the
national reimbursement rate for that service; the sum of the weighted quantities divided by the
number of Medicare enrollees is the total utilization for each area. Because this approach relies
on billing codes for thousands of detailed services, systematic differences across areas in coding
11

could introduce inaccuracies into this measure. Also, services not covered by Medicare are not
included.
The year of the study is 1990, with the utilization and mortality measures based on an
average of 1989-91. Many of the other measures are obtained from the 1990 Census of
Population. There are 224 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with populations exceeding
100,000.7 In addition, residents of MSAs with less than 100,000 are aggregated to one group
within each state and residents outside MSAs are also aggregated to one group per state. The
result is 313 areas.8
In this paper the areas are aggregated into seven “regions” as follows:
Region

1.

North:

New England, Middle Atlantic, and East North Central

2.

Upper South:

Delaware, Maryland, D.C., Virginia, and West Virginia

3.

7.

West:

This regional breakdown was developed by a geographer, Ge Lin, who found it to be more useful
than the conventional census regions or divisions in studying disability among the elderly (Lin,
2000). We find this breakdown intuitively appealing, especially for the distinctions it makes
among the southern states and among the mountain states and its treatment of Florida as a
12

separate region.
We also aggregate areas according to their total population size in the following manner
(1) Over 500,000, (2) 250,000 to 500,000, (3) 100,00 to 250,000, (4) Under 100,000 (aggregated
to a single area within a state), and (5) Non MSAs (aggregated to a single area within each state).
When regions and population size are used as dummy variables, the omitted categories are North
and Over 500,000.

IV. Results
Table 1 presents a list of variables included in this paper, giving the short name,
definition, and source. For a fuller explanation of the derivation the utilization measures, see
Appendix A. The utilization measure, mortality, percent high school dropout (LOED), and real
income have all been adjusted for age and sex. Cigarette use and obesity are state measures; the
same value is assigned to every area within each state. Particulate concentration (Pollution) is
only available for MSAs >100,000.
Table 2 provides summary statistics for each variable. The means and standard
deviations are calculated by weighting each area by its share of the population white ages 65-84.
Looking first at the means, we see that inpatient utilization accounts for about two-thirds of the
total and outpatient utilization one-third. Admissions are approximately evenly divided between
medical and surgical. Approximately one-half of total physician utilization is accounted for by
treatment (procedures), about one-third by evaluation and management, and about one-sixth by
diagnostic interventions.
The utilization measure shows considerably more variation across areas than does
13

mortality. The relative variation in outpatient utilization is more than double that for inpatient
utilization. As between medical admissions and surgical admissions, the former has twice the
variation of the latter. Diagnosis has the most variation of the three types of physician services;
all three have much greater variation than hospital admissions. This difference may be explained
in part by more random variation in the measure of outpatient utilization, which has a smaller
mean and is calculated from a smaller sample.
Utilization Indexes By Region and Population Size
Tables 3 and 4 show indexes of utilization for areas grouped by region or population size
for various types of utilization. All indexes are based on US=100. All are adjusted for age and
sex, and areas are weighted by their population of whites 65-84. The first column of Table 3
shows total utilization is much greater in Florida than in the rest of the country. Utilization is
lowest in Big Sky. Across areas grouped by population size, total utilization is highest in the
areas with over 500,000 population and, the 250,000-500,000 population group is second
highest. The other three categories all have below average utilization, with little difference
among them.
Comparisons between indexes for inpatient (INUTIL) and outpatient (OUTUTIL)
utilization (Table 3 columns 2 and 3) show many substantial differences, both for regions and
population size. Most noteworthy is Florida, where the inpatient index is slightly below the
national average, but outpatient utilization is approximately 55 percent above. In Big Sky the
direction of difference is reversed; the inpatient index exceeds the outpatient index by more than
20 percentage points. Areas of large population size tend to show relatively more utilization of
outpatient care; the reverse is true for MSAs < 100,000 and the areas that are not MSAs.
14

Substantial regional and population size differences in the indexes for medical admissions
and surgical admissions can be seen in Table 4. In Florida, the index for surgical admissions is
15 percentage points higher than for medical admissions; the West region also has relatively
more surgical admissions. In the three southern regions, medical admissions tend to be relatively
higher than surgical admissions but the only big differential is in the Deep South.
The final utilization comparisons in Table 4 are among three types of physician services:
evaluation and management, diagnosis, and treatment (surgical and non-surgical procedures).
The differences for Florida are huge, with the index for diagnostic tests 63 percent above the U.S.
average while evaluation and management is only 27 percent above. The procedures/treatment
index is intermediate at 45 percent above the U.S. average. When only the areas above 100,000
are compared, the differentials are slightly smaller. In Big Sky the diagnostic test index is
particularly low: 14 percentage points below the procedures/treatment index in the same region.
Correlations Among The Different Measures of Utilization
Most measures of utilization are positively correlated, suggesting that the forces that
influence variation in utilization across areas are stronger than the possibilities for substitution
between various types of utilization. For example, the coefficient of correlation between
inpatient and outpatient utilization is 0.27, even though there are surely some opportunities for
substitution between inpatient and outpatient care. Similarly, although some health problems can
be treated either medically or surgically, the correlation between medical admissions and surgical
admissions is 0.47. The largest negative correlation , -0.13, is between medical admissions and
physicians’ diagnostic services. (For a full set of correlation coefficients see Appendix Table B1).
15

Mortality Indexes
Table 5 presents mortality indexes for areas grouped by region or by population size. As
in the utilization tables, all indexes have been adjusted for age and sex, and areas are weighted by
the population of whites 65-84 in those regions. The most striking result is the low mortality in
Florida, which is slightly more than 10 percent below the U.S. average. Also below the U.S.
average are Big Sky and West regions. The other four regions all have above average mortality
with the Deep South experiencing the highest rate, more than 8 percent above the U.S. average.
When areas are grouped by population size, the most notable result is that the mortality indexes
are approximately the same across all the groups. Apparently despite the many socio-economic
and other differences that exist between the large and the small metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, white death rates at ages 65-84 do not vary with population size.
The second and third columns of Table 5 allow comparisons of mortality between ages
65-74 and 75-84 (adjusted for sex mix). On the whole, the indexes are very similar. The
regional rankings of mortality for the two age groups are almost identical. There is a slight
tendency for the regional differentials to be smaller at ages 75-84 than at 65-74. When ageadjusted mortality rates for men and women are compared (columns 4 and 5 of Table 5), two
substantial regional differentials are evident. In Deep South the relative mortality index is more
than 7 percentage points higher for men than for women. In West, the index for men is 6
percentage points lower than for women.
Socioeconomic and Other Indexes
Differentials in socioeconomic and other indexes across areas grouped by population size
and region are shown in Table 6. Florida again stands out from the rest of the country in several
16

respects. The percentage of high school dropouts is the lowest and real income the highest of all
the regions. Only the West rivals Florida in having a low percentage of elderly with less than 12
years schooling. By contrast, the percent of dropouts is particularly high in the Deep South.
Across the population size groups, the patterns for the percentage of high school dropouts and
real income are quite systematic, with the former indexes rising and the latter falling as
population size falls.
Regional differences in cigarette use and obesity are not as large as for the percentage
with low education and have distinctive patterns of their own. Cigarette use is highest in the
Deep South and lowest in the West. Obesity is highest in the North and WestSouth and lowest in
Florida. Both cigarette use and obesity are lowest in the two largest population size groups and
highest in the three other groups. In this respect, the pattern is similar to that for low educational
attainment.
The reasons for including BLACK in the study will become apparent in discussion of the
mortality regressions. For the present, we note that this variable has great regional variation,
with extremely high rates in the Upper South and Deep South and extremely low rates in Big Sky
and West. The index is much above average in the largest metropolitan areas and considerably
below average in all the others.
The last variable in Table 6, pollution, is only measured for the MSAs greater than
100,000. The index for the West is 21 percent above the U.S. average; all other regions are
below the U.S. average, with the lowest rate in Florida. Across population size groups, the
pollution index declines steadily from the largest to the smallest.

17

Correlations Among Variables
Some variables, such as low education and real income, are highly correlated with one
another; the coefficient is –0.61. Low education is also significantly correlated with cigarettes
(0.38) and obesity (0.37). All three variables are significantly correlated with mortality: low
education (0.49), cigarettes (0.44), and obesity (0.41). For a full matrix of correlation
coefficients among all the variables see Appendix Table B-2
Regression Analysis: Utilization
In this section, we consider what factors appear to explain the various measures for
utilization. All variables are in natural logs except for the region and population size dummy
variables. All regressions are run across the 313 areas and across the 224 MSAs > 100,000. At a
theoretical level, the relation between low education and utilization is uncertain. It might be
negative because individuals with less than 12 years of schooling might lack information about
health care or might have less easy access to care. On the other hand, the relationship might be
positive to the extent that those with less education are in worse health and require more care.
The predictive relation between income and utilization is also uncertain. If higher-income
individuals are in better health, the relationship might be negative, but the relationship could be
positive if there is a strong positive income elasticity of demand for care. Among other
considerations, higher-income individuals are more likely to have private insurance that
supplements Medicare.
Finally, because poor health usually results in increased utilization of health care, we
expect mortality to be positively related to utilization to the extent that mortality is a good
indicator of poor health. The relationship could be negative if this effect is outweighed by a
18

reverse causality running from greater utilization to lower mortality. Because of the possibility
of reverse causality, the parameter estimate for MORT should be regarded as a lower-bound
estimate of the true coefficient.
Table 7 presents regression results for our measure of total utilization for three
specifications. The first includes only the region and population size dummies, the second the
two socioeconomic variables and mortality, and the third all the variables together. The results
for the 224 MSAs are similar to those for the 313 areas and are available in Appendix Table B-3.
Probably the most striking result is the large coefficient for MORT: With all variables included,
it is 0.51 (0.08). Under the reasonable assumption that the mortality rate is a good indicator of
the health of the population, we infer that variation in health status across areas is a major
determinant of health care utilization among whites 65-84. Another notable result is the large
increase in the Florida coefficient when the other variables are added to the regression. All the
population size dummies have significant negative coefficients; that is, utilization is greater in
MSAs larger than 500,000 than in any of the other areas. One likely interpretation is that patients
in large metropolitan areas find it easier to obtain care (because of closer proximity to hospitals
and physicians and the availability of a wide range of specialists).
Table 7 also presents regression results for inpatient utilization and outpatient utilization
for the specification that includes all the variables. The coefficient for mortality is very large for
inpatient care, but much smaller for outpatient care. For Florida, the reverse is true, with a huge
coefficient for outpatient care and a much smaller (but still statistically significant coefficient) for
inpatient care. In contrast, the Big Sky region has a large, statistically significant positive
coefficient for inpatient care and a negative one for outpatient care. Clearly, regions differ both
19

with regard to overall utilization as well as with respect to specific components of care. Neither
low education nor real income are significantly related to utilization after controlling for the other
variables. This result may reflect the offsetting theoretical considerations discussed above.
Table 8 presents similar regression results for medical and surgical admission and the
three types of physician services. The coefficient for mortality is extremely large for medical
admissions, no doubt reflecting the severe illness of many patients with neoplastic,
cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases who are admitted to medical services with little
hope of altering the final outcome. The mortality coefficient for surgical admissions is less than
half that for medical admissions, but still highly significant. In contrast, none of the three types
of physician utilization has a mortality coefficient that is significantly different from zero.
The relationship between mortality and utilization reported in this paper is echoed in a
study by Frohlich, Fransoo, and Roos (2001) of 12 communities in Winnipeg, Manitoba. They
found that age-sex adjusted deaths before age 75 (their “Premature Mortality Rate”) was
positively correlated with most types of care. However, PMR was not correlated with visits to
specialists and negatively correlated with “high profile” procedures such as MRIs, CABGs, hip
and knee replacements, and preventive services.
The coefficients for Florida are particularly large for diagnostic and treatment services,
smaller but still highly significant for evaluation and management, and smallest for hospital
admissions. The Big Sky region has notably large negative mortality coefficients for evaluation
and management and diagnostic services and a notably large positive coefficient for medical
admissions. In comparisons of utilization across areas grouped by population size, the most
striking result is the much higher utilization of evaluation and management and diagnostic
20

services in MSAs > 500,000 relative to those with 250-500,000 and especially areas with less
than 250,000 or not MSAs. The only significant result for the socio-economic variables is a
large positive relation between real income and treatment.
Because there may be some causality running from utilization to mortality, we also ran
two-stage least squares regressions. The results are reported in Appendix Table B-5. The
coefficients for predicted Ln mortality are typically much larger than in the OLS regressions, but
the standard errors are also much larger, raising questions about the reliability of the estimates.
Regression Analysis: Mortality
In addition to the dummy variables for region and population size, the mortality
regressions include the percentage of who did not finish high school and mean real income.
Education and income have been shown to exhibit strong associations with mortality. Similarly,
the harmful effects of cigarettes and obesity on health have been well established. Finally, we
also include a variable measuring the fraction of the population that is African-American. We
hypothesize a positive relationship between the percentage black and mortality for two reasons.
First, this variable may be a marker for selective migration; migrants tend to be healthier than
nonmigrants and they may have disproportionately opted for areas with low percentage black. A
second set of reasons involve differences between the areas directly related to the percentage of
African Americans. These differences might take the form of changes in the psychosocial
environment that adversely affected health, or changes the quantity and mix of locally-provided
services.
The mortality regression results are presented in Table 9 in three specifications similar to
those shown for utilization. First we note that the R2s are considerably higher for mortality than
21

for utilization regressions. This is despite the fact that none of the population-size dummies are
significantly different from zero either when just the geographical dummies are included or when
the other variables are entered into the regression. This is unlike the utilization regressions
where there is a significant differential between the largest areas and the others.
Inclusion of the other variables results in a significant reduction in the negative
coefficients for Big Sky and West. There is also a small reduction in the negative coefficient for
Florida. Nevertheless, even after controlling for all the other variables, Florida has a coefficient
(relative to North) of -0.096 (0.01). It is the region with by far the lowest mortality. After
controlling for the other variables, the highest regional mortality is in the Upper South.
Looking at the other variables we find that the percentage of high school dropouts has a
positive coefficient until the geographic variable dummies are entered into the equation. Then
the coefficient, while still positive, is not significantly different from zero. In the full regression
real income has a negative coefficient which is significantly different from zero. Cigarette use
has the expected positive coefficient which becomes larger when the geographic dummies are
included. Obesity has the expected positive coefficient but it becomes smaller when the
geographic dummies are included. Finally, the percent black has a positive coefficient and also
remains relatively unchanged by inclusion of the geographic dummies. In the regressions across
the 224 MSAs > 100,000, shown in Appendix Table B-6, the results are similar. In addition, the
pollution index has the expected positive coefficient and remains relatively unchanged in the
presence of the geographic dummies.
Preliminary efforts to find an effect of income inequality were unsuccessful. In fact, in a
variety of specifications, the coefficient for inequality was always negative. Similarly, we found
22

no evidence of a relationship between religiousity and mortality whether measured by percent of
religious adherents or by frequency of church attendance.

V. Two Puzzles
Here we consider two specific puzzles regarding patterns of mortality and utilization.
The first puzzle is why the percentage of African-Americans in an area is positively related to the
mortality of whites 65-84. The second puzzle concerns the unusually low mortality and
unusually high utilization in Florida relative to the rest of the country.
Percent Black and Mortality
Why should the mortality of whites 65-84 be significantly positively related to the percent
of the total population of an area that is black? The possible answers fall into two main
categories. First, there may be health differences among the elderly whites that are correlated
with BLACK, differences that are not accounted for by the other variables in the mortality
regression. Such differences could arise as a result of selective in- and out-migration under the
reasonable assumption that the movers are healthier than the stayers.
Second, there may be differences among the areas that are correlated with the white
mortality. Some of these differences could take the form of fewer, locally provided services or a
different mix of services that affect white mortality. Some differences could be psychosocial,
such as racial tension or the fear of crime.
In order to learn more about the relationship between percent black and white mortality,
we tested to see whether it is stronger in areas of high or low segregation. Using three CutlerGlaeser measures of segregation – centralization, isolation, and dissimilarity -- we divided the
23

areas into equal groups of high segregation and low segregation and ran the basic mortality
regression for each group. In none of the three trials did the coefficient for LnBLACK differ
significantly between the high and the low segregation group. The mean coefficient for the three
high segregation groups regressions was 0.018 and for the low segregation groups 0.022.

It

appears that the relation between BLACK and MORT is about the same for areas of high and low
segregation.
Another attempt to gain insight into the percent black effect produced more significant
results. We divided the 224 MSAs > 100,000 into two equal groups based on the percentage
change in the population of whites 65-74 between 1980 and 1990. The two groups are
designated as “high growth” and “low growth” respectively. We then ran identical, full
specification regressions for each group with the following results for the percent black
coefficient: In the high growth areas, the coefficient is 0.051 (0.010); in low growth areas, the
coefficient is 0.008 (0.009). The fact that percent black is not significantly related to mortality in
the low growth areas suggests rejection of explanations that rely on differences among the areas.
If such differences were causal, it is not easy to see why they would not also be operative in the
low growth areas.
The large coefficient in the high growth areas suggests the possibility of unmeasured
differences in selective migration, with the healthier (or more health conscious) migrants moving
to the areas with lower percent blacks. However, if there is also a selective out-migration, why
doesn’t that produce a significant coefficient for BLACK in the low-growth areas? One possible
answer is that much of the out-migration probably comes from a relatively few, very large areas
such as New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston and Detroit whereas the destination of the
24

migrants is more dispersed with many going to areas with relatively small populations. This
means that the effect of out-migration on the mortality rates of the remaining populations could
be much less than the effect of in-migration on mortality rates in the high growth areas.
Floridian Exceptionalism
The data examined in this paper reveal that Florida is exceptional in three respects: (1)
Among whites ages 65-84 utilization of care is much higher than in any other region and the
differential increases when other variables are introduced as controls; (2) Mortality is by far the
lowest in the country; (3) The positive relation between mortality and utilization which is
evident in the rest of the country is not present in Florida.
Above average Medicare spending in Florida has been well established in previous
studies, e.g., Wennberg and Cooper (1999). Our direct, detailed measures of utilization of
services (rather than nominal or deflated Medicare spending) show that the Florida differential
from the North of 0.193 (0.021) when only population size is controlled for rises to 0.270 (0.023)
when education, real income, and mortality are included in the regression. Depending on the
type of care, the size of the Florida differential varies enormously, from 0.058 (0.029) for
medical admissions to 0.499 (0.049) for diagnostic services.
With respect to mortality the introduction of other variables reduces the negative
coefficient for Florida from –0.134 (0.014) to –0.096 (0.015), but it still remains much larger
than Big Sky, the region with the next lowest mortality –0.026 (0.012).
The combination of low mortality and high utilization is one of the most intriguing
aspects of Floridian exceptionalism. When total utilization in Florida is regressed on mortality
(controlling for education and income, all variables in logs) the coefficient is slightly negative,
25

albeit not significantly different from zero. For the country as a whole, including Florida, the
coefficient is 0.515 (0.084); when Florida is excluded the coefficient rises to 0.636 (0.092).
In order to gain some insight into Floridian exceptionalism, we examined each Florida
MSA > 100,000 separately as shown in Table 10. Predicted levels of utilization and mortality,
obtained for each MSA from regressions that exclude Florida, are compared to actual levels, and
the percent differential between actual and predicted calculated. We see that utilization is above
predicted in every Florida MSA, but the differentials tend to be largest in the southern portion of
the state. The mortality differentials also tend to be greatest in the southern MSAs; indeed the
three most northern MSAs have actual mortality that is above the levels predicted from the
regression. Two exceptions to the north vs. south differences are Daytona Beach and Ocala;
these relatively northern MSAs have utilization and mortality differentials that resemble those of
the southern MSAs.
Is Florida the only state with exceptional results? To answer this question we examined
several other states that have been mentioned in health policy discussions as being unusual with
respect to utilization or mortality or both. With methods analogous to those used to obtain the
results presented in Table 10, we calculated percentage differentials between actual and predicted
values for MSAs > 100,000 in Arizona, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah. The results
presented in Table 11, show some differentials, but nothing that comes close to challenging the
characterization of Florida as “exceptional.”
Another possible explanation for the low mortality rates in Florida is migration. Suppose
that people who move to Florida are, on average, healthier than their counterparts who did not
move. Given the large share of Florida residents who have moved from other states, one would
26

expect that Florida would be a very healthy region simply because of this selection effect.
To test this hypothesis, we used the Medicare claims database for 1998 in Miami and
Tampa, Florida, two regions with large populations of retirees. We first compared mortality rates
of current residents of these areas as a function of where they were living three years previously.
The sample was limited to nonblacks aged 68-84, with a cut off of 68 to ensure that we could
match Medicare denominator information on zip code of residence from three years before when
they were 65. Migrants from the North experience a lower mortality probability (odds ratio equal
to 0.80, 95% confidence interval of 0.71 to 0.91), which is consistent with the hypothesis that
migrants tend to be somewhat healthier than non-migrants. Migrants from other parts of the
country, however, showed if anything slightly elevated mortality rates, although individually the
effects were not significant. In any case, the overall influence of recent migrants (during the past
3 years) is minimal with regard to overall mortality rates because the proportion of recent movers
– just 4.2 percent of the sample – is so small. Weighting the odds ratios by the proportion of
people who migrated implies that the influence of this recent migration on overall mortality rates
in the region is to reduce it by only about 0.5 percent.
The three-year window is probably too restrictive. Another approach is to use the first
three digits of the individual’s Social Security number. For this cohort, Social Security numbers
were most likely issued while in their adult years, particularly during the 1940s through the
1960s when eligibility of Social Security gradually expanded to cover most employment sectors.
This approach runs the risk of including in the “migrant” category individuals who may have
been living in Florida for several decades. In any case, the results do not support the migration
explanation; the one-third of the sample who received their Social Security number in Florida
27

had slightly lower mortality than those who received their number in some other region.
If selective in-migration does not explain low mortality in the southern Florida MSAs,
there are two other possibilities that need to be explored. First, the relatively benign climate for
most of the year allows the elderly residents to pursue a great deal of physical activity including
golf, tennis, swimming, walking, etc. Such activity is undoubtedly conducive to better health.
Second, the low mortality in the southern Florida MSAs may result from a high level of social
interaction among the elderly, as well as public services directed toward this very large voting
bloc. Many of them live in communities populated primarily by other elderly where there is a
great deal of eating out together, participating in social functions, and helping one another at
times of physical or emotional stress.
Many social critics deplore age-restricted living arrangements and argue that the elderly
would derive health and other benefits from interactions with members of younger generations.
Reconciliation of these two points of view could lie in the classic quantity-quality trade-off.
Holding the quantity of social interaction constant, the social critics may be correct that
interactions across generations are more beneficial. But it also may be true that the greater
quantity of social interactions in the elderly-segregated communities more than offsets the lower
value of a given unit of interaction.
As is apparent from the above discussion, it is much easier to document Floridian
exceptionalism than it is to explain it. We do not think that the high utilization is the cause of the
low mortality because there is no support for this view in data for the rest of the country. When
we tried utilization as a RHS variable in the mortality regression, the coefficient was positive in
both OLS and 2SLS specifications. Nor do other studies find in comparisons between Florida
28

and other regions that reductions in mortality are attributable to greater levels of care (Skinner,
Fisher, and Wennberg, 2001). One “demand-driven” explanation for both high utilization and
low mortality is that Floridians are very concerned about health, and this concern may also be
expressed in exercise, diet, and other behaviors that are demonstrably linked to longevity, as well
as increased demand for medical care.

VI. Summary
This paper examines 313 U.S. areas for differences in medical care utilization and
mortality of whites ages 65-84 in 1990. Areas are grouped into seven regions and five groups
based on population size. Utilization is measured by direct count of detailed services, weighted
by the national reimbursement for each service.
Probably the most noteworthy result of the utilization regressions is the extent to which
cross-area variation in utilization is related to variation in mortality. For total utilization, the
elasticity is 0.515 (0.084) after controlling for region, population size of area, education and real
income. This is a lower-bound estimate; the true coefficient would be larger to the extent that
there is a negative relationship running from utilization of care to mortality. The elasticity is
especially large for medical admissions, and especially small for physicians’ diagnostic services
and treatments.

29

Also noteworthy is the extent to which the well-known propensity for higher utilization in
Florida is even larger after controlling for socioeconomic variables and mortality. The
coefficient for Florida is 40 percent (eight percentage points) higher when the other variables are
in the regression.
A third result worthy of comment is the much higher utilization in MSAs of over 500,000
population relative to other areas. The average differential is about eight percent. Among the
other areas there is no strong pattern related to population size. Similarly, there is no consistent
pattern for the socioeconomic variables in their relationship to total utilization of care (although
see McClellan and Skinner, 1999).
The mortality regressions produced several noteworthy results. First, we find no
relationship between mortality and population size. Elderly residents of large MSAs enjoy no
advantage in life expectancy over their peers who live in small MSAs or outside MSAs despite
the well publicized differentials in the availability of medical care. Secondly, we find a very
large negative coefficient for Florida. This region has by far the lowest mortality of any large
region regardless of whether or not other variables are controlled for. Cigarette smoking, air
pollution, and obesity have their expected positive coefficients. Lastly we note a robust positive
relationship between percent black and mortality of whites 65-84. This relationship is
particularly strong among areas with above average growth of the elderly population between
1980 and 1990. Among low growth areas, the coefficient is not significantly different from zero.
This puzzle, and the exceptional results for Florida for utilization and mortality, require further
investigation.

which aggregated data are used to make inferences about individual causal pathways,
a concern of particular importance to any research on geographic variation (Susser,
1994a, 1994b). For example, the percentage of the elderly population that is Hispanic
is predicted to increase regional Medicare expenditures (Cutler and Sheiner, 1999),
yet average Medicare expenditures for Hispanics is roughly equal to expenditures for
non-Hispanics.
