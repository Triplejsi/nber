Airbus versus Boeing Revisited: International Competition in the Aircraft Market
Douglas A. Irwin and Nina Pavcnik
NBER Working Paper No. 8648
December 2001, Revised October 2014
JEL No. F13,F12
ABSTRACT
This paper examines international competition in the commercial aircraft industry. We estimate a discrete
choice, differentiated products demand system for wide-body aircraft and examine the Airbus-Boeing
rivalry under various assumptions on firm conduct. We then use this structure to evaluate two trade
disputes between the United States and European Union. Our results suggest that aircraft prices increased
by about 3.7 percent after the 1992 U.S. – E.U. agreement on trade in civil aircraft that limits subsidies.
This price hike is consistent with a 5 percent increase in firms’ marginal costs after the subsidy cuts.
We also simulate the impact of the future entry of the Airbus A-380 super-jumbo aircraft on the demand
for other wide-bodied aircraft, notably the Boeing 747. We find that the A-380 could reduce the market
share of the 747 by up to 14.8 percentage points in the long range wide-body market segment (depending
upon the discounts offered on the A-380), but would reduce the market for Airbus’s existing wide-bodies
by an even greater margin.

1. Introduction
One of the recurring trade disputes between the United States and Europe concerns the
rivalry between Airbus and Boeing in the market for wide-body aircraft. Airbus first began
production of aircraft in the early 1970s with substantial financial assistance from European
governments. As Airbus succeeded in making inroads into many of Boeing’s markets, Boeing
alleged that Airbus benefited from unfair subsidies and has pressured U.S. trade authorities to
counteract Europe’s financial support. As a result, the United States and European Community
signed an agreement on trade in civil aircraft in 1992 that limited government subsides for
aircraft production. This agreement, however, has come under new strain as Airbus introduces
the A-380 super jumbo aircraft designed to compete directly against the Boeing 747.
Competition in the wide-bodied aircraft industry has attracted attention not just because
of the controversy surrounding the Airbus subsidies, but because of the industry’s unusual
market structure, in which economies of scale are enormous relative to market demand. The
aircraft sector provides a textbook example of an industry in which trade policy could affect the
strategic interaction between a domestic and an international rival and shift profits in favor of the
domestic firm, as proposed in Brander and Spencer’s (1985) canonical model of strategic trade
policy. Previous studies of the commercial aircraft market, notably Baldwin and Krugman
(1987), Klepper (1990, 1994), and Neven and Seabright (1995), used calibrated simulations to
analyze the competitive interaction of Airbus and Boeing. These simulations focused on
Airbus’s impact on the costs and profits of its competitors and on consumer surplus as a way of
evaluating the welfare effects of Airbus’s market presence.
This paper takes an empirical approach to examining international competition and trade
disputes in the wide-body aircraft market. We employ Berry’s (1994) method of estimating

2

demand in an oligopoly market with differentiated products using data on commercial aircraft
prices, sales, and characteristics from 1969 to 1998.1 This approach provides us with estimates
of price and cross-price elasticities of demand, which allow us to assess how closely related in
demand various aircraft are. The demand system, combined with an assumptions on firms’
market conduct and learning parameter in production, also yields estimates of price-cost
markups, allowing us to determine whether competitive pressures have increased in this segment
of the market as a result of Airbus’s entry and Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas’s exit.2
We then focus on two aspects of the international rivalry between Airbus and Boeing.
First, we examine whether the 1992 U.S-E.U. agreement on trade in civil aircraft limiting aircraft
subsidies had a significant impact on pricing in the aircraft market. We find that the agreement
appears to have raised the prices of both Airbus and Boeing aircraft by about 3.7 percent in the
narrow- and wide-body market. Our structural model and estimates of the wide-body market
suggest that these price increases are consistent with about 5 percent rise in the marginal cost of
production after the subsidy cuts. Second, we use our demand estimates to estimate the impact
of the introduction of the A-380 on the prices and market shares of other wide-body aircraft,
notably the Boeing 747. We find that the A-380 can be expected to have a significant negative
effect on the prices and sales of the 747 within the wide-body market, but an even greater
adverse effect on demand for Airbus’s existing wide-body aircraft (the A-330 and A-340). This

1

Our approach of estimating demand is in the spirit of Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1999) and Goldberg (1995)
who examine the impact of trade restraints in the automobile industry.
2
One recent study that combines elements of demand estimation and industry simulation is Benkard (2003). He
estimates demand parameter for wide-body aircraft and uses them with estimates of a cost function that accounts for
learning by doing to compute numerically the dynamic equilibrium in the aircraft market and simulate the evolution
of the industry. He also simulates the welfare implications of an antitrust policy that places an upper bound on the
market share that any one firm can achieve and finds that this harms consumers. Although our approach to
estimating market demand is similar (we allow for additional market segmentation in the market for medium- and
long- range wide-body aircraft, an important differentiation according to our empirical results), our paper ultimately
addresses a different set of issues.

result highlights the fact that as Airbus and Boeing expand their product line over time, profit
maximization by multi-product firms becomes more complicated as demand for a firm’s existing
models is sensitive to the price and characteristics of its new models.
2. Structural Estimates of Aircraft Demand and Markups
The market for aircraft is typically divided into two product categories: narrow-body and
wide-body aircraft. Narrow-body aircraft are single aisle, short-range aircraft (up to 6,000 km)
that typically carry between 100 to 200 passengers. The leading aircraft in this category are the
Boeing 737, the Boeing 757, and the Airbus A-320. Wide-body aircraft are double aisle,
medium to long-range aircraft (up to 14,000 km) that can carry between 200 to 450 passengers.
The leading aircraft in this category are the Boeing 747, the Boeing 777, and the Airbus A-300.
Within the wide-body market, planes also differ significantly in terms of their characteristics
depending on whether they are aimed at serving the medium range (i.e. Boeing 767, the Airbus
A-300 and A-310, DC-10, and L-1011) or long-range market (i.e. Boeing 747 and 777, the
Airbus A-330 and A-340, and the MD-11). As a result, we can view narrow-body, mediumrange wide body, and long-range wide body aircraft as imperfect substitutes for one another
because the planes are designed to serve different markets. Figure 1 plots the typical number of
seats and the range of various aircraft and indicates how localized the competition is within the
narrow-body, medium range wide body, and long-range wide-body segment.
We focus mainly on the wide-body segment of the industry in part because most of the
international trade disputes have centered on competition in this product range. The increase in
international travel since the 1970s has made this a rapidly growing segment of aircraft demand.
The wide-body market has also been very profitable: the Boeing 747, for example, is said to
account for as much as a third of Boeing’s entire profits in certain years. As a result, Airbus, for

4

example, entered the aircraft market in this segment with the A-300 in 1974, and only later began
competing in the narrow-body market with the launch of the A-320 in 1988. There are fewer
product lines in wide-body segment of the market, and the number of aircraft sold is much
smaller than in narrow-body segment. The cumulative output of the best selling wide-body
Boeing 747 has only reached about 1,185 units in 1998 (it was introduced in 1969), and the best
selling Airbus aircraft A300 sold only 481 units between 1974 and 1998. As a result,
competition tends to be more intense in the wide body market, since from the firm’s perspective,
each additional sale generates valuable revenue. In contrast, narrow-body planes often sell well
above 1,000 units over their lifespan, with Boeing 737 selling over 3,200 units until 1998.
2.1 Demand for Wide-Body Aircraft
The structure of our aircraft demand system is based on the discrete choice random utility
framework outlined in Berry (1994). This framework enables us to estimate the demand for a
differentiated product using product-level data on sales, prices, and other product attributes,
without observing the purchases made by individual consumers. In this framework, consumers
(airlines) have a choice of purchasing either one of several wide-body aircraft or an outside good.
Because aircraft are durable goods, we follow Benkard (2003) and incorporate used planes in the
demand estimation. In particular, the outside good consists of new narrow-body aircraft and
used wide-body planes. Utility from the outside good is normalized at zero. The total potential
market therefore consists of all new aircraft and used wide-body aircraft.
We model each wide-body aircraft as a bundle of characteristics that airlines value.
These characteristics include price, range, passenger seating, and takeoff weight. Our framework
also allows the airlines to value aircraft characteristics that are not directly observed. Airline i’s
utility of purchasing product j (uij) can be expressed as a linear function of aircraft j’s

5

characteristics and tastes idiosyncratic to airline i, so that uij = x j β − α p j + ξ j + τ ij , where xj is a
vector of product j’s attributes, and pj is aircraft price. ξj represents aircraft j’s characteristics
that the airlines value, and τij captures airline i’s specific taste for aircraft j, both of which are not
observed by the econometrician. The mean utility level that product j yields to airlines is
denoted by δj, so that δ j ≡ x j β − α p j + ξ j . Note that in this framework all variation in the
valuation of aircraft across airlines stems from the unobserved additive taste term τij.
We allow consumer-specific tastes to be correlated across products with similar
characteristics by using a nested logit demand model. We group wide-body planes into two
distinct market segments g: medium-range and long-range wide-body aircrafts. Consumers also
have an option of not purchasing a wide-body plane and purchasing the outside good. We can
then rewrite the consumer taste parameter τij as τ ij ≡ vig (σ ) + (1 − σ )ε ij . Term εij captures

consumer tastes that are identically and independently distributed across products and consumers
according to the extreme value distribution. Term vig captures the common taste that airline i has
for all aircraft in market segment g. The common taste depends on the distribution parameter

σ (0 ≤ σ < 1) , which indicates the degree of substitutability between products within a market
segment. When σ is zero, consumer tastes are independent across all aircraft and there is no
market segmentation. The higher the σ, the more correlated the consumer tastes are for products
within the same market segment and the competition among products is stronger within than
across market segments.3

3

Benkard (2003) allows for market segmentation between the outside good and wide-body market, but does not
distinguish between the medium- and long-range segments of the wide-body market. Our estimates of σ indicate the
importance of allowing for the additional market segmentation. In addition, he estimates the model using data from
1975 to 1994 whereas our data span 1969 to 1998. The additional years of data are important because the A-330, A340, and Boeing 777 only enter the market in 1993 and 1995.

6

Given the set of available aircraft, airlines are assumed to select the aircraft that gives
them the highest utility.4 Consumer i will choose aircraft j if uij ≥ uik . Given the distributional
assumptions on consumer tastes and functional form for utility, we can aggregate over individual
consumer purchases to obtain predicted aggregate market share sj of aircraft j:
(1)

s j (δ , σ ) =

δ j /(1−σ )

( ∑ Dg

)

,

where Dg ≡ ∑ e

δ j /(1−σ )

.

j∈g

g

The first term in this expression is aircraft j’s market share in its market segment, while the
second term is the market share of a market segment g in the overall aircraft market. Since the
outside good yields zero utility by assumption, δ0 is 0 and D0 is 1. We can invert the predicted
market share for product j to obtain an analytic expression for mean utility level δj as a function
of demand and distribution parameter σ: ln S j − σ ln S j| g − ln So = δ j ( S , σ ) ≡ x j β + α p j + ξ j .
Rearranging the above equation yields our estimating equation for demand:
(2) ln S j − ln So = x j β + α p j + σ ln S j|g + ξ j

where Sj is the observed market share of product j, S0 is the observed market share of the outside
good, and Sj|g is the observed market share of product j within its market segment g.
2.2 Estimation Results

We estimate demand equation (2) using annual product level data on wide-body aircraft
prices, sales, and characteristics from 1969 to 1998. The data cover worldwide sales by Airbus,
Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Lockheed Martin. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of
the data; further information on sources and data construction are described in the Data

4

While this framework allows an airline to purchase only one aircraft at a time, airlines often concurrently purchase
several aircraft. Since we do not observe individual purchases, we cannot address this issue. Hendel (1999)
explicitly models and estimates the demand for computers allowing for multiple purchases.

Appendix. Note that in this study, market share is measured in terms of number of planes sold
(rather than revenue share).
There are three issues in estimating (2). First, although the econometrician does not
observe aircraft quality ξj, the aircraft producers likely set the price of product j to reflect the
product quality. The aircraft prices are therefore likely correlated with unobserved quality.
Second, the within-group market share Sj|g are also likely correlated with ξj. We instrument for
the two variables with two types of instruments: cost-shifters (hourly manufacturing wages in
the E.U. and the U.S. and the price of aluminum), and the characteristics of the rival aircraft x-j
averaged over the entire wide-body market and averaged over products within each market
segment. Cost shifters affect product prices, but are uncorrelated with product j's unobserved
quality. Similarly, rival products’ characteristics influence the market share and prices of rival
aircraft, and through strategic interaction, also affect the pricing decisions and market shares of
the product j in question. However, they are not econometrically correlated with product j's
unobserved quality ξj. The key identifying assumption is that product attributes xj are not
correlated with ξj. The demand equation is linear in all parameters and the error term, so it can
be estimated by two-stage least squares.5 Finally, errors are likely heteroskedastic and serially
correlated.6 We thus report standard errors that are robust to arbitrary forms of
heteroskedasticity and serial correlation.
Table 2 presents the estimation results. Column 1 reports the OLS estimates of the
demand parameters and column 2 reports two-stage least squares estimates (IV). Accounting for

5

Estimating the demand equation separately from the pricing equation (i.e. the supply side) does not affect the
consistency of the estimates.
6
One potential source of heteroskedasticity is the sampling error in the dependent variable due to low number of
planes of particular type sold in each year. For example, the average number of planes of particular type sold is 26
(the 25th percentile is 14 and the 75th percentile is 37). Our standard errors are robust to arbitrary forms of
heteroskedasticity, so they also account for this potential source of heteroskedasticity.

8

the endogeneity of price and within market segment market share affects the estimated
parameters. For example, the OLS estimate of the price coefficient in column 1 is -.0265, while
the magnitude of coefficient on price increases (in absolute value) in the IV regression (-.0488).
These estimates are in line with our expectation of upward bias in the OLS coefficient. The
coefficients on other product attributes seem sensible. Focusing on the IV estimates in column 2,
the additional take-off weight, additional seating and range are positively related to aircraft
market share. The coefficients on these characteristics are not estimated very precisely, which is
not surprising given the low number of products and the fact that aircraft manufacturers do not
change typical characteristics for a given aircraft model very frequently.
The estimated value of σ is 0.45, which suggests that planes within the medium- and
long-range market segment are better substitutes for each other than planes across the market
segments. This has important implications for competition among various aircraft. If a new
product is introduced into a long-range wide-body market (for example, Airbus A-380), it will
erode the market share of the products such as Boeing 747 and Airbus 340 more than the market
share of Boeing 767, which competes mostly with medium-range planes. Similarly, if, for
example, the Boeing 747 increases its price, this increases the market share of its rivals in the
long-range wide-body market segment by more than the market share of its competitors in the
medium-rage market segment.
This substitutability of products is quantified in table 3 that presents the weighted means
of the own and cross price elasticities of demand.7 The average demand elasticity increases in
absolute value over time, averaging about -2.9 in the early 1970s to -7.8 in the late 1990s. These
estimates suggest that a 1 percent increase in the price lowers a plane’s market share by 2.9%

7

The elasticity formulas are available in an unpublished appendix available on the authors’ web sites.

(7.8%) during the early 1970s (late 1990s). Thus, the aircraft market appears to have become
much more price sensitive over time, despite the exit of some firms, potentially due to the
increase in number of different aircraft produced by each firm and the growing stock of used
aircraft that is potentially on the market. Within a year, the own-price elasticities also differ
across products, for example, ranging from -4.3 for Boeing 767 to -11.2 for Boeing 747 in 1998.
In addition, the estimates of the cross-price elasticities reported in column 2 (for products
in the same market segment) and 3 (for product in different market segments) suggest that
products within each market segment are closer substitutes for each other than products across
the segments. For example, the average cross-price elasticity during the late 1990s suggests that
a 1 percent increase in the price of a product leads on average to 1.4 percent increase in the
market share of the products in the same segment and only .05 percent increase in the market
share of the product in a different market segment.8
2.3 Aircraft Markup Estimates

We can obtain consistent estimates of product demand without assuming the mode of
competition among the firms. However, in order to calculate firm markups we need to assume a
specific form of firm conduct. Suppose that firm f maximizes the present discounted value of its
profits given by:



 j∈F
 ft





π ft = Et  ∑ β t  ∑  p jt q jt ( p ) − c jt q jt ( p )   
 t = s

where Et is the expectation operator conditional on information at time t, β is the discount factor,
qjt is quantity of product j at time t (which is a product of market share of product j at time t and
8

The cross-price elasticities actually decline in general over time. This is not surprising, since the number of
products in the market has increased. Thus, the effect of a price increase of a product on the market share of each of
its competitors diminishes.

10

total market size at t, i.e. q jt = s jt ( p ) M t ), cjt is the marginal cost of product j at time t, and all
other notation follows from previous notation. This objective function accounts for two
characteristics of the aircraft industry—learning by doing in production and multi-product firms.
First, the existence of learning by doing implies that firm’s choices today affect the costs of
production in the future through accumulated experience. Firms likely consider these
intertemporal linkages in their profit maximizing decision. In particular, these dynamic
considerations might make it profitable for a firm to price below marginal cost during the initial
stages of production in order to quickly accumulate the experience and reduce the future cost of
production. Second, Airbus, McDonnell Douglas, and Boeing are multi-product firms that are
selling several products during most time periods. Thus, when Boeing considers lowering a
price of one of its products, this will not only reduce the market share of Airbus’s products, but
might also undercut the sales of Boeing’s other products. Boeing might then lower its prices by
less than in a situation when it only sells one product.
There is mixed evidence on whether aircraft producers compete in prices or quantities.
Anecdotal evidence on the widespread use of price discounts and favorable financing options
suggests that aircraft companies compete in prices. Yet price competition might be a
questionable assumption during the periods when firms face capacity constraints. As a result we
compute markups based on both Bertrand and Cournot modes of competition for purposes of
comparison.9
Assuming that firms compete in prices, first-order conditions for profit maximizing firm f
with respect to product j at time t yield:
9

For example, a Harvard Business School case study reports significant underbidding between Boeing and Airbus,
and cites the former Airbus Chairman Alan Boyd admitting to “pricing for market share...we had to do it in order to
get our feet in the door.” Yet Tyson (1992) reports that industry sources claim that capacity constraints were not
binding during the 1980s. An unpublished appendix available on the authors’ web sites derives the equilibrium for
Cournot competition.

To derive a pricing equation for each product j at time t, we use vector notation. Let pt denote a
Jx1 price vector at time t, ct a Jx1 vector of marginal costs, and st a Jx1 vector of market shares
of all products offered at time t (time subscript is omitted in the notation). Let Ωt be a JxJ matrix
whose element in row j and column k equals −

Equation (4) indicates that in equilibrium, the firms equate marginal revenue of product j to the
product j’s “dynamic marginal cost” cjt*, i.e. the sum of current marginal cost cjt and the
expected discounted value of reduction in future cost attributed to current output, fjt.10 This
setting encompasses the possibility that profit maximizing firms price below the current marginal
cost in order to gain experience that lowers the future cost of production.
If firms were static profit maximizers or there was no learning by doing in production, the
expected discounted value of reduction in future cost attributed to current output, fjt would be
zero. Equation (4) would then equate marginal revenue to current marginal cost, and dynamic
marginal cost would equal to current marginal cost (ie. c=c*). Thus, equation 4, combined with
our demand parameter estimates and the data on prices and market shares, would enable us to

10

Note that the above equilibrium ignores the fact that a firm’s actions will affect its profits via the effect on the
other firms’ future optimal output decisions.

12

calculate the markup margin over price ( ( p jt − c jt ) / p jt ) for each product j at time t. However, in
the presence of learning by doing, calculation of markup margins also requires an estimate of
learning rate in order to differentiate between dynamic and current marginal cost.
We would ideally obtain an estimate of learning rate by estimating a traditional learning
model where current marginal cost is a function of cumulative output Zjt:
t −1

(5)

c jt = Aj Z θjt with Z jt = ∑ q jt and Z j1 ≡ 1
s =1

where Aj is a firm specific cost parameter and parameter θ measures the learning rate.11 The
estimation of (5) ideally requires information on unit cost of production and cumulative output.
Unfortunately, we do not have access to detailed cost data (as, for example, in Benkard (2000
and 2003)). As a result, we would need to base our estimate on a product’s dynamic marginal
costs implied by the equilibrium condition (4). High learning rate would imply that dynamic
marginal cost should decrease through time. However, the implied costs do not drastically
decline during the first few years after the entry. This might be at first surprising given high
estimates of learning rate for aircraft in Benkard (2000) and semiconductors by Irwin and
Klenow (1994). However, the cost curves in the numerical simulations of Benkard’s (2003)
dynamic oligopoly model of aircraft industry (that do not rely on price data) are basically flat 2
to 3 years following the introduction of a plane (see figure 6 in his paper). 12 We think that the
lack of steep decline in cost in the first few years following the entry in our data is due to the fact
that our cost estimates (unlike estimates by Benkard (2000, 2003)) rely heavily on price of
The learning rate is calculated as 1-2θ. For example, a 20% learning rate (associated with θ of -.33) implies that a
doubling of output reduces unit cost of production by 20 percent.
12
Using detailed data on labor inputs for L-1011, Benkard (2003) suggests that learning effects seem to matter
initially in the production process, but are not a key factor later on: for most years, learning effects are small in
relation to the production run. He shows that learning is effectively exhausted once L-1011 production reaches
about 80 aircraft. Most Boeing aircraft sell at least this many products within two or three years after introduction
(the Boeing 777 took 4 years to reach that level), while most Airbus aircraft reach this figure within the first 4 to 5
years after the initial launch.

aircraft. Aircraft prices, however, are not declining drastically through time (as, for example, in
semiconductor industry).
Rather than relying on our data to obtain an estimate of learning parameter, we instead
compute current marginal cost (and thus markup margins) for several potential values of the
learning parameter the following way. First, using data on quantity produced, we compute the
ratio between dynamic marginal costs and current marginal cost, implied by cost function (5),

reduction in future cost attributed to current output, fjt, we assume that firms have perfect
foresight and that firms consider cost reductions for 10 periods into the future.13 We set the
discount rate β of .95. When learning rate is high, dynamic marginal cost will be much lower
than the current marginal cost in the initial stages of production. However, as firms accumulate
sufficient experience, the expected future cost declines associated with current output will
become smaller. Thus the dynamic marginal cost will be similar to the current marginal costs.
Hence, the ratio djt should increase through the life of an aircraft toward 1 as firms take
advantage of learning economies of scale and future reductions in marginal cost due to higher
current output become less important.14

13

Because our data ends in 1998, we obviously do not observe full 10 years of future production for product-year
observations starting in 1989. When future data is not available, we make use of quantity reported for the last year
of our data (1998) and compute output at t+1 as .7 times output at time t (where t=1998) and continue to do so until
the 10-year time horizon is reached for each product-year observation with unavailable future data. We choose .7
because regression of current output on lagged output yields a coefficient of .7. Given that most aircraft have
already had significant experience accumulated in 1998 and have thus already taken advantage of significant
learning economies, the simulations are not very sensitive to the assumption on unobserved future output.
14
In fact, at 20% learning rate, our data suggest that the output weighted average of the ratio (over all aircraft) is .47
in the 1st year of production, .72 in the 2nd year, .8 in the 4th year, and .9 in the 10th year of production of the aircraft.

14

Second, we take our estimates of dynamic marginal costs implied by (4) as given. We
then compute a measure of current marginal cost as c jt =

c*jt
d jt

and use it to compute markup

margins ( p jt − c jt ) / p jt . We perform this exercise for several values of learning parameter
θ ranging from 0 to -.4, which correspond to learning rate of 0 to 25 percent.
Table 4 presents weighted averages of various markup margins through time. Different
panels of the table correspond to calculations based on different values of learning parameter.
The three columns report markup margins based on assumption of multiproduct Bertrand, single
product Bertrand, and multiproduct Cournot competition. Several interesting findings emerge.
Let us first focus on the markup margins when learning rate is zero, which correspond to markup
margins obtained in static profit maximization. First, multi-product Bertrand estimates suggest
that the average markup margins decline from .36 in the early 1970s to .15 in the late 1990s.
This indicates that the competition in the aircraft market has increased over time despite the
presence of only a few firms. Second, the multi-product firm markups are higher than singleproduct firm markups and the difference becomes much more pronounced over time. While no
firm offered more than one wide-body aircraft in the 1970s, Airbus and Boeing introduced new
products starting in the 1980s. When firms have several closely related products on the market,
they become less aggressive in terms of price competition because reducing the price on one
product reduces demand for its other products (and not just the demand for its rivals’ products).
As a result, the markups accounting for multi-product firms are on average 12 percent higher
than the single-firm markups in the 1990s. Finally, the markup estimates are not very sensitive
to whether firms compete in prices or quantities. Cournot markup margins and display similar
patterns as the Bertrand markup margins.

Given the importance of dynamics in early stages of production, let us now consider
markup margins when we account for learning by doing, taking the learning parameter to be -.3,
corresponding approximately to a 20 percent learning rate suggested by industry sources.15
Several interesting patterns emerge. First, accounting for dynamics often yields negative markup
margins for individual products (not displayed in the table), especially during the first few years
following the entry and in scenarios with higher learning rate. For example, our markup margins
for individual products range from -1.1 to .37 at 20 percent learning rate. In addition, period
averages reported in table 4 suggests that in general, markups are lowest during the 1974 to 1978
period, 1984 to 1988 period, and 1990s. This pattern is consistent with the fact that those periods
follow market entry and thus intensified competition. Anecdotal evidence suggests increased
competition for the market share in both of these entry episodes.16 Moreover, even when we
account for dynamics we continue to find that multiproduct markups exceed single product
markup margins and that the difference between the two increases through time. Similarly, the
markup estimates are not very sensitive to the assumption on the mode of competition (Bertrand
vs. Cournot).17

15

This information is based on personal correspondence with the chief economist of Boeing, Bill Swan. Benkard
estimates a learning parameter of -0.29 for the L-1011(i.e. 18 percent learning rate). Benkard also estimates cost
functions where he explicitly accounts for forgetting. We do not separately identify learning and forgetting. Thus
the learning rate could be viewed as a net learning rate.
16
For example, A-300 entered in 1974, following the entry of DC10 in 1971 and L-1011 n 1972. A-310 and
Boeing 767 entered in 1982 and 1983, respectively. Moreover, A330 and A340 entered in 1993 and Boeing 777
entered in 1995.
17
We can also compare these markup margins to estimates by Benkard (2003), who simulates a dynamic model of
the aircraft industry assuming that firms compete in quantities. It is difficult to make direct comparisons between
his results and ours because he simplifies the industry’s structure and product varieties to reduce the computational
burden of dynamic simulations. His model does an excellent job matching the observed markups of L-1011 (or the
type of plane that matches l-1011 in his simulations), whose actual markup margin over price is essentially zero or
negative throughout its lifespan. Our estimates for L-1011 based on 20 percent learning rate yield markup margins
between -.19 to .2. His simulations also suggest that other plane types have negative markups during the first 2-3
years. However, calculations based on the graphs of his simulated prices and costs suggest that most aircraft other
than L-1011 in the industry simulation actually have positive markups during most of their lifespan (except for the
first 2-3 years). In particular, in most periods after the initial 2-3 years, other aircraft have markup margins around
14 to 17 percent with occasional periods when markup margins drop to 3 to 5%. We find a similar pattern.

3. Aspects of Airbus-Boeing Competition

The structural estimates from the previous section can be used to explore the impact of
two important events: (1) the 1992 agreement between the United States and European
Community regarding subsidies and competition in the aircraft production, and (2) the entry of
the A-380, Airbus’s new wide body that aims to compete directly with the Boeing 747.
3.1 Impact of the 1992 Agreement

Following the trade tensions between the United States and the European Union
surrounding the subsidized entry of the A-300 in the early 1970s, the rivalry between Boeing and
Airbus intensified considerably after Airbus introduced the narrow-body A-320 in the mid1980s. After Air India cancelled an order for Boeing 757s when Airbus offered steep discounts
on the A-320, the U.S. government intervened on Boeing’s behalf. The United States threatened
using the countervailing duty laws or opening a Section 301 case against Airbus unless an
agreement on subsidies was reached. In 1992, the United States and European Community
reached a bilateral agreement on trade in civil aircraft (see Tyson 1992 and Pavcnik 2002). The
agreement establishes limits on the direct and indirect (military) subsidies used to finance the
development of new aircraft. The maximum allowed direct subsidy is 33 percent of
development costs. In addition to development subsidies, governments also provide assistance to
domestic producers through measures that might affect variable cost of production. As a result,
the agreement has several provisions that affect the variable production cost of aircraft and might
thus affect pricing in the aircraft market. For example, the agreement prohibits production
subsidies and restricts the government's ability to help the domestic aircraft producer offer
financing to airlines. The agreement also requires detailed reporting on subsidies, interest rates,
and repayment conditions, and establishes procedures to monitor the agreement. Finally, the

17

agreements repayment provision requires that Airbus make repayments on a per-plane basis
rather than delay repayment until the end of the loan, reducing the incentive for Airbus to cut
price significantly to capture certain sales.
The unanswered question is whether the 1992 bilateral agreement had any impact on
pricing in the aircraft market. In particular, one would a priori expect the agreement to increase
prices because the agreements provision on financing, production subsidies, and repayments of
the loan implicitly increase the marginal cost of an aircraft. Although we can never truly identify
the effect of the 1992 U.S.-E.U. agreement on aircraft prices, our data enable use to compare the
aircraft prices before and after the agreement. We thus regress aircraft prices (in logs) on a
dummy variable set at unity from 1992 and other potential determinants of price. We control for
other time-varying factors that could affect the pricing of aircraft through the inclusion of GDP
growth, price of petroleum, market segment Herfindahl index, and a time trend. Product fixed
effects control for the differences in characteristics across aircraft that affect pricing.18 Since the
estimated coefficients are not statistically different from each other when we estimate the
separate narrow-body and wide-body market segment separately, we pool the data from both
market segments to gain efficiency. We restrict our analysis to data from 1985 onwards so that
we have equal number of time periods before and after the treaty.
Table 5a presents the results. The coefficients on the treaty indicator in columns 1-4
suggest that prices of aircraft have on average increased after the 1992 U.S. – E.U. trade
agreement. The estimates range from 9.4 to 3.7 percent as we add controls for other timevarying factors that could independently affect prices such as market concentration captured by
Herfindahl index (column 1), GDP growth and price of petroleum (column 2), a time trend
(column 3), and all of the above controls (column 4). In columns 6-9, we allow the treaty to

18

have a differential impact on Airbus’s pricing by interacting the treaty indicator with the Airbus
indicator. Our results suggest that the agreement did not have a statistically differential impact
on the pricing of Airbus. Moreover, the coefficients on the treaty indicator are similar to the
magnitudes obtained in columns 1-4.
One potential problem with our analysis is that the positive coefficient on the treaty
indicator could simply reflect extremely high prices in one unusual year following 1992 rather
than consistently higher prices from 1992 onwards (or extremely low prices in one unusual year
before 1992). To check for this possibility we consider general trends in prices during the years
surrounding the 1992 agreement by regressing aircraft prices (in logs) on year indicators (1991 is
the omitted indicator) and product fixed effects. The coefficients on year indicators relative to
1991 and their 95 percent confidence intervals are depicted in figure 2. The coefficients on year
indicators for 1992 onwards are all positive. As a result, it is unlikely that one particular year is
driving our findings.19
Overall, this evidence suggests that the 1992 U.S.-E.U. agreement limiting aircraft
subsidies raised the prices of Boeing and Airbus aircraft. This behavior is consistent with a
Cournot or a Bertrand duopoly model in which subsidies are eliminated. Given that no publicly
available data exist on the magnitude of the subsidy reductions, it is difficult to judge whether
these price increases are big or small. However, the structural model and estimates for the widebody aircraft from section 2 enable us to check how big of subsidy reductions these price
increases potentially imply. In particular, we use the estimates of demand parameters, marginal
costs c implied by Bertrand pricing equilibrium, predicted market share equation (1), and
equilibrium pricing equation (4) to simulate equilibrium prices under various increases in firms'

Columns 5 and 10 of table 5a repeat regressions in columns 4 and 9 without the 1985 data (1985 has unusually low
prices). We continue to find a positive coefficient on the treaty indicator.

19

marginal costs (i.e. various reductions in subsidies). We consider firms' marginal cost increases
ranging from 5 to 20 percent. In these simulations we assume that dynamic marginal cost equal
to the current marginal costs. Because all but one of the planes sold in 1992 (i.e. MD-11) have
been on the market for at least 10 years, they have likely already taken advantage of learning and
the future cost reductions from current output are likely small. In fact, the weighted average of
the ratio of dynamic to current marginal cost based on the calculations reported in section 2.3 is
.89 when learning rate is approximately 20 percent. This confirms that firms have already
accumulated significant experience and that abstracting from future cost reductions associated
with current output might not be problematic. Table 5b reports the average prices of wide-body
aircraft under each of the scenarios and the average percent increase in prices (relative to the
baseline of no change in marginal cost). The table suggests that the observed average 3.7 to 7.5
percent price rise corresponds to about 5 to 10 percent increase in the marginal costs of firms.
3.2 Impact of A-380 Entry

The most recent trade controversy centers on government funding for Airbus’s superjumbo aircraft, the A-380, whose first deliveries are expected in the year 2006 (see Pavcnik 2002
for details on the controversy). As Figure 1 indicates, the A-380 will be the world’s largest
passenger aircraft, designed to carry between 550 to 650 people, have a range of over 14,200 km
(8,000 miles), and have a takeoff payload of 540,000 kg. The governments of France, Germany,
and the United Kingdom are expected to cover about one-third of the estimated $12 billion in
development costs. The United States has warned European governments that the Airbus
financing may violate the 1992 agreement and subsidy rules established in the World Trade
Organization in 1994. The EU has countered by asking that indirect subsidies to Boeing from
military and NASA contracts be examined.

20

Press reports indicate that the list price of the A-380 is $235 million, but also suggest that
discounts on the order of at least 10 percent are being negotiated with potential buyers. Some
reports even indicate that 35 percent discounts have been offered, but the industry observers
believe such large discounts will not last for long. Airbus has indicated that 250 aircraft must be
sold for it to break even and cover the enormous development costs. Airbus has only decided to
go ahead with the production once the advanced orders hit the 50-plane mark, and about 60
planes had been ordered as of early 2001. The A-380 is designed to compete directly against the
Boeing 747 at the high end of the wide-body market. Airbus claims that due to the operatingcost effectiveness of the A-380 (relative to Boeing 747), the airlines flying the A-380 need to fill
only 33 additional passenger seats to break even (relative to Boeing 747 break-even passenger
requirement). Boeing denies that there is a profitable market for such “super jumbos” and is
planning on producing modified versions of the 747 to compete against the A-380.
Given the heated trade debate and controversy surrounding the A-380 entry, we simulate
the impact of the entry on the prices and market share of existing aircraft using our structural
parameter estimates and product characteristics from section 2. We proceed as follows. First, an
estimate of A-380 mean utility level requires values for A-380 observed attributes and
unobserved quality. We take the announced prices and characteristics of the A-380 as given.
Moreover we assume that its unobserved quality equals the unobserved quality of A-340 in 1998.
We use the A-340 unobserved quality (rather than the unobserved quality of the 747), because
Airbus planes potentially share similar unobserved characteristics. A-340 unobserved quality
does not fluctuate much over time and it follows a similar time path as the unobserved quality of

21

747 during the late 1990s (albeit unobserved quality of 747 is about 1.7 times higher).20 Thus,
focusing on the 1998 values is not likely to be problematic. In additional simulations, we
allowed the A-380 quality to take values between the quality of A-340 and 747.21 This did not
change the main characteristics of simulated results reported below (albeit A-380 obviously
gained greater market share).
Using the estimates of the demand parameters and the information on the A-380
attributes we next predict the A-380 mean utility level δ.22 We then incorporate the A-380 mean
utility level δ in the predicted market share expression (1) for each of the existing products and
the outside good. Finally, using this “augmented” predicted market share equations (1) and the
pricing equation (4), we simulate the new equilibrium prices and market shares for each of the
existing products.
Airbus has an incentive to initially offer large price discounts (and potentially price
below marginal cost) to secure a large market share for the A-380 and to take advantage of
economies of scale. We thus explicitly consider how price discounts on A-380 affect the A-380
current market share and simulate the annual post entry market when the A-380 is sold at the list
price, and at a 10-, 20- and 30-percent discount. Moreover, by comparing the ratio of dynamic to
current marginal cost we can actually check whether the existing planes have already
substantially exhausted gains from learning by 1998. If this ratio is close to one, firms do not

20

The unobserved quality of A-340 also follows a similar trend to the unobserved quality of A-330 with the
exception of the initial two years. A-330 quality is low in the initial two years, it then increases, and then relatively
levels off.
21
These results are presented in the unpublished appendix available on the authors’ web sites.
22
One potential problem with this analysis is that because of the unprecedented size of A-380, the demand estimates
might not apply to A-380. We perform two checks for whether our demand system is potentially misspecified.
First, we estimate a version of the demand equation in which we include the square and cubic value of the predicted
dependent variable. The two nonlinear terms are insignificant and the F-test of joint insignificance yields a p-value
of .15. Second, we graph the demand residuals against various included aircraft characteristics. Visual inspection of
the graphs does not show significant nonlinear trends in the residuals. Thus, out of sample predictions are likely not
very problematic.

22

anticipate significant future cost reductions associated with current output. The weighted
averaged of the ratio in 1998 is .92 (when we assume 20% learning rate; the ratio is above .96 for
five out of eight aircraft) which suggests that abstracting from the dynamic aspects for existing
planes is likely not very problematic. By 1998, all the existing planes have been on the market
for at least four years and have thus already captured most of the benefits of learning by doing.
As a result, we focus on static equilibrium for existing planes (i.e. we equate the current marginal
cost to dynamic marginal cost).
Table 6 presents these results. The top part of the table reports overall market share and
the changes in overall market share under different scenarios relative to the no entry case. The
middle part of the table reports the aircraft market share within a market segment (and respective
changes in market share relative to the no entry case). The bottom part of the table reports prices
(and respective changes in prices relative to the no entry case). Given that the press releases
suggest significant initial price discounts on the A-380, we focus on the results when the A-380
is sold at a 20 percent discount. The no entry case always serves as the comparison group.
Several interesting findings emerge. First, the A-380 gains about 1 percent of the overall
annual market (which translates into 38 aircraft), and 17.4 percent of the long-range market
segment. Boeing 747, for example, controls 1.2 percent of the overall market prior to the A-380
entry (28.5 percent of the long-range market segment). Second, the simulation results reflect the
importance of market segmentation within the wide-body market. As a result of A-380 entry, the
overall market share of a long-range wide body aircraft (for example Boeing 747) declines by 1.6
percent (.0002 decline in market share), while the overall market share of a medium-range plane
(for example Boeing 767) declines only by .9 percent (.0001 decline in market share). This
translates into the total annual loss of 7 sales by the existing long-range varieties and the total

23

annual loss of .3 sales by the existing medium-range wide body varieties. Third, the market
share loss is substantial for Airbus’s own products, especially in the long-range market segment
since their prices do not fall as much following the A-380 entry. The A-380 substantially
undercuts the demand for the A-330 and A-340, which illustrates the risk that multi-product
firms face in introducing new models. For example, the A-380 lowers the combined market
share within wide-body market segment of the A-330 and A-340 by more than it lowers the
within wide-body market share of the 747. Moreover, the declines in prices of wide-body
Boeing aircraft range from 0.9 to 1.3 percent, while the declines in prices of existing Airbus
wide-body aircraft are about .3 percent. Nevertheless, the overall market share of Airbus still
increases. Overall, given that the industry sources indicate that the Boeing 747 accounts for a
substantial portion of Boeing’s profits, the subsidized A-380 entry into the market might have a
significant negative impact on the U.S. producer and lead to future conflicts in U.S.-E.U. trade
relations.
Finally, the comparison of the results across various pricing options for the A-380 reveals
the importance of price discounts in securing a higher market share for the A-380. While Airbus
is only able to sell 1 A-380 per year at the list price (corresponding to .02 percent market share),
the annual sales of the A-380 increase to 6 planes at a 10 percent discount (.1 percent market
share), 38 sales at 20 percent discount (1 percent market share), and 177 sales at 30 percent
discount (4 percent market share). Our results thus seem to be consistent with the reports that
cumulative orders for the A-380 are now around 60 planes and that some of these aircraft have
been sold at significant discounts.
Before we conclude, the question obviously arises whether Airbus can sell enough A380s at relatively high prices to recoup its development and production costs. Let us consider

24

the predictions of simulations, where Airbus sells the A-380 at a 20 percent discount off its $230
million list price reported in table 6. Without additional growth in demand, this yields 38 annual
sales, amounting to 760 planes sold and $140 billion in revenues over the next 20 years (ignoring
discounting). These figures suggest that the A-380 will likely cover its development costs
(estimated to be $12 billion), and that Airbus might be able to repay government loans.
However, the estimates fall short of Airbus's forecast that the airlines will demand 1,500
superjumbos over the next 20 years, yielding around $345 billion in revenues. In fact, the
simulated number of total sales is closer to Boeing's predictions that market will only demand
around 700 superjumbos overall. According to Boeing, these sales are insufficient for the project
to eventually become profitable. Of course, the above analysis abstracts from other potential
reasons for bringing A-380 to the market. For example, if there are synergies in owning all
Airbus (or Boeing) planes, the introduction of a long range plane such as A-380 might induce
additional airlines to switch away from Boeing to Airbus planes.
4. Conclusions

This paper has taken an empirical look at international competition and trade disputes in
the wide-body aircraft market. We began by estimating the demand for wide-body aircraft and
firm markups under various assumptions on the mode of competition. This exercise yields
several insights into the wide-body aircraft market. First, we find evidence of significant market
segmentation between the medium-range and long-range wide body planes, consistent with the
anecdotal evidence on the near monopoly position enjoyed by the Boeing 747 in the long-range
market until the early 1990s. Second, despite the small number of firms in the industry, market
competition has intensified (we estimate higher demand elasticities and lower markups over
time), especially with the entry of new aircraft varieties. Third, the markup estimates implied by

25

the Bertrand and Cournot competition are relatively similar. This might be explained by the
growing presence of multi-product firms in the industry. As producers expand the range of
products, their incentive to aggressively underbid their rivals is diminished, since price cuts
might also hurt their own sales of other products. Fourth, the presence of multi-product firms
makes it more challenging for the aircraft companies to successfully introduce new aircraft
without hurting their existing product line.
Given that the aircraft industry continues to be the source of trade friction between the
United States and the European Union, we evaluated two key trade issues. We find evidence that
the 1992 U.S. – E.U. agreement to limit subsidies resulted in higher aircraft prices. Although we
cannot say anything about the magnitude of the government development subsidies that have
helped aircraft producers to launch their products, our evaluation of the 1992 agreement suggests
the observed price increases after the agreement are consistent with increases in firms’ marginal
costs by about 5 percent. We also predict that the introduction of the Airbus A-380 will
substitute most strongly for existing Airbus aircraft rather than the Boeing 747, although the
negative impact on demand for the 747 is not negligible. The extent of this substitution depends
critically on the price discounts that Airbus offers on the A-380.
Nevertheless, many questions remain unanswered. Most importantly, without more
detailed information on production cost, we also cannot address the issues of strategic trade
policy that are more dynamic in nature such as the role of government subsidies to promote the
aircraft market entry. Benkard (2003) provides a first step in this direction.

Data Appendix

We take our data on annual aircraft deliveries and average sales price from 1969 to 1998
from the industry publication The Airline Monitor (May 1999 issue). Aircraft characteristics,
such as passengers, range, take-off weight, typical number of seats were taken from various
issues of Jane’s World Aircraft. Summary statistics on data are provided in Table 1 for widebody and narrow-body aircraft. Data on A-380 characteristics was obtained from the Airbus
Industrie web site (http://www.airbus.com/pdfs/A380/BRIEF2000.pdf).
Data on producer price indices, exchange rates, price of petroleum, GDP growth, and the
price of aluminum are taken from IMF's International Financial Statistics Yearbook. Data on the
U.S. hourly manufacturing wages and the U.S. producer price index is from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (online data). Data on hourly manufacturing wages for France, Germany (the states
comprising former West Germany), and Great Britain are from the Yearbook of Labor Statistics
published by the International Labor Organization. We computed a weighted average of hourly
manufacturing wages in France (weight is .4), Germany (weight is .4), and Great Britain (weight
is .2) using weights that mimic the individual country’s ownership shares in the Airbus
Consortium. Similar procedure was used to compute the producer price index for Airbus. All
values are expressed in 1995 U.S. dollars.

Note: θ denotes the learning rate used in calculation of current marginal cost.
The reported markups are output-weighted period averages. In some instances
the initial observation is omitted for 747, MD-11, and A330 because the model
predicted negative ratio of dynamic to current marginal cost in the first year due
to low first year output and high future output. This inflated the markup
estimates in that year.

Note: Simulations are based on demand parameter from table 2, column 2 and multiproduct Bertrand pricing. The reported changes are
differences between various scenarios relative to the base of no A380 entry reported in column 1. Simulations use aircraft characteristics from
the last year of the data (1998). The changes in sales (i.e. change in number of planes sold) reported on the bottom of the table are calculated
based on the 1998 market size (4424 planes). Market shares are based on quantities of planes sold.
