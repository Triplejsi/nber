Foreign Direct Investment and the Operations of Multinational Firms:
Concepts, History, and Data

ABSTRACT
The concept and measurement of foreign direct investment have changed over time, and what is
measured by balance of payments flows and stocks is quite different from what is implied by theories of
direct investment. The industrial distribution of stocks of FDI, the most widely available measure, is only
poorly related to the distribution of FDI production, and changes in stocks are poorly related to changes
in production.
FDI flows have grown in importance relative to other forms of international capital flows, and
the resulting production has increased as a share of world output, but it was still only about 8 per cent at
the end of the 20th Century. The United States began its role as a foreign direct investor in the late 19th
Century, while it was still a net importer of capital. It became the dominant supplier of direct investment
to the rest of the world, accounting for about half of the world’s stock in 1960. Since then, other countries
have become major direct investors. The U.S. share is now less than a quarter of the world total and the
United States has become a major recipient of FDI from other countries.

1. Introduction
The term “Foreign Direct Investment,” or “FDI,” encompasses two related but different sets of
topics or activities, explained by different theories and by different branches of economics. The
first might be referred to as the international finance, or macro, view. The second might be
referred to as the industrial organization, or micro, view.
The macro view sees FDI as a particular form of the flow of capital across national
borders, from home countries to host countries, measured in Balance of Payments Statistics.
Those flows give rise to a particular form of stocks of capital in host countries, namely the value
of home country investment in entities, typically corporations, controlled by a home country
owner, or in which a home country owner holds a certain share of voting rights. The variables of
interest are the flow of financial capital, the value of the stock of capital that is accumulated by
the investing firms, and the flows of income from the investments.
The micro view tries to explain the motivations for investment in controlled foreign
operations, from the viewpoint of the investor. It also examines the consequences to the
investor, and to home and host countries, of the operations of the multinationals or of the
affiliates created by these investments, rather than the size of the flows or the value of the
investment stocks or investment position. These consequences arise from their trade,
employment, production, and their flows and stocks of intellectual capital, unmeasured by the
capital flows and stocks in the balance of payments, although some proxies for the flow of
intellectual capital are part of the current account. These motivations and consequences are
intrinsically related to the investing firms’ control of the affiliates and the ability of the
multinationals to coordinate the activities of parents and affiliates.

1

The micro view is the older one, preceding interest in direct investment as a form of
capital flow. It was reflected in concerns about the consequences of foreign control for the host
economy, represented by book titles such as The American Invaders, (1901), or The American
Invasion (1902), two of the earliest titles listed by Wilkins (1970). It was also reflected in one of
the earliest research studies of U.S. direct investment, which attempted to explain the
motivations behind firms’ expansion into foreign countries (Southard, 1931).
2. Concepts of Foreign Direct Investment
What is a Foreign Direct Investment Entity?
Firms and individuals have many different possible ways of holding assets in foreign countries.
Which of these are considered direct investment and which firms are considered multinational
enterprises depends on the definition of a “foreign direct investment entity”.
What constitutes a foreign direct investment entity has been defined differently for
balance of payments purposes and for studies of firm behavior. It has also been defined in
different ways by different countries and the definition has changed over time. The definition of
foreign direct investment as a capital flow and a capital stock has changed correspondingly.
The dominant current definition of a direct investment entity, prescribed for balance-ofpayments compilations by the International Monetary Fund (1993), and endorsed by the OECD
(1996), avoids the notion of control by the investor in favor of a much vaguer concept. “Direct
investment is the category of international investment that reflects the objective of a resident
entity in one economy obtaining a lasting interest in an enterprise resident in another economy.
(The resident entity is the direct investor and the enterprise is the direct investment enterprise).
The lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor

2

and the enterprise and a significant degree of influence by the investor on the management of the
enterprise” (IMF,1993, p 86).
While the concept is vague, the recommended implementation is specific. “… a direct
investment enterprise is defined in this Manual as an incorporated or unincorporated enterprise
in which a direct investor, who is resident in another economy, owns 10 % or more of the
ordinary shares or voting power (for an incorporated enterprise) or the equivalent (for an
unincorporated enterprise) (IMF, 1993, p. 86).
The IMF definition is governing for balance-of-payments compilations, but there is a
different, but related, concept and a different official definition in the United Nations System of
National Accounts, the rule book for compiling national income and product accounts, that
retains the idea of control, and reflects the micro view more. In these accounts, which measure
production, consumption, and investment, rather than the details of capital flows, there is a
definition of “foreign-controlled resident corporations.”

Foreign-controlled enterprises include

subsidiaries more than 50 % owned by a foreign parent. “Associates” of which foreign
ownership of equity is 10-50 %, “…may be included or excluded by individual countries
according to their qualitative assessment of foreign control…” (Inter-Secretariat Working Group
on National Accounts, 1993, pp. 340-341). Thus, from the viewpoint of a host country, and for
analyzing production, trade, and employment, control remains the preferred concept.
In the United States, the first official survey of outward direct investment, conducted by
the U.S. Department of Commerce for the end of 1929, sought to measure “…the amount of
capital involved in the extension of American enterprise into foreign countries…” (U.S.
Department of Commerce, 1930, p. 1). In that survey, “Foreign ‘direct investments,’ as herein
considered, include those commercial and industrial properties situated abroad and belonging to

3

residents of the United States and its Territories, from which a return is normally expected. They
are called ‘direct investments’ to distinguish them from ‘portfolio investments’ acquired through
the purchase of foreign securities publicly offered and through the international securities
movement; by definition, therefore, pure ‘interest capital’ and capital that moves incidental to a
migration of labor are, in large part, excluded. Investments of the ‘portfolio’ type are included
when they are a part of the holding of American commercial and industrial corporations. Pure
‘interest’ capital is included when invested in American-controlled corporations operating
abroad” (ibid), pp. 1-2). The survey asked U.S. companies for the value of “…investments in
lands, buildings, factories, public utilities, warehouses, shops, stocks of goods, wharves, marine
equipment, and other property in foreign countries… that are owned in whole or in part by your
company or by an affiliated or subsidiary corporation.” (ibid, p. 51).
The next survey, for 1936, again emphasized the interest in “the international extensions
of American business enterprise” ( U.S. Department of Commerce, 1938, p.2). The control
aspect of the definition was made more explicit, referring to “…those foreign corporations or
enterprises which are controlled by a person or small group of persons (corporate or natural)
domiciled in the United States, or in which such person or group has an important voice ….The
factor of control has been purposely emphasized in the definition, since it is considered to be the
most significant basis for classifying investments. However, no hard and fast quantitative
measurement of control has been devised. Minority interests have been included in these data in
considerable number and volume. The reason, of course, is that the degree of control is not
measured exactly by the percentage of common stock held. In no case has an investment holding
of less than 10 % been included in this category, and interests of less than 20 % are few in
number and small in value…” (ibid, pp. 2-3). It was later emphasized that using a 50 % criterion

4

“…would be to miss its qualitative aspect…the quantitative basis fails to measure accurately the
vital ties and connections between American and foreign corporations. The qualitative measure
may also lead one into some errors because it is difficult to gage the force of character and
leadership of the individuals associated with the enterprises…” (ibid, p. 45).
The outward survey for 1950 ( U.S. Department of Commerce, 1953) provided a more
precise definition, covering four categories of FDI:
1. “Foreign corporations, the voting securities of which were owned to the extent of
25% or more by persons or groups of affiliated persons, ordinarily resident in the
United States.”
2. “Foreign corporations, the voting stock of which was publicly held within the United
States to an aggregate of 50 % or more, but distributed among stockholders, so that
no investor, or group of affiliated investors, owned as much as 25 %.”
3. “Sole proprietorships, partnerships, or real property (other than property held for the
personal use of the owner) held abroad by residents of the United States.”
4. “Foreign branches of United States corporations.”
By this time the Department had moved away from criteria requiring judgments as to degree of
control toward those that could be implemented mechanically, perhaps because the number of
firms involved had become too large for handicraft judgments. However, the idea behind the
definition still stressed control and the thought that control was a determinant of behavior.
In recent years, the U.S. Department of Commerce has followed what are now the IMF
guidelines. The latest inward direct investment benchmark survey defines direct investment in
those terms and uses the 10 % criterion. In contrast to the 1950 rules, the survey publication
states that “Direct investment refers to ownership by a single person, not to the combined

5

ownership of all the persons in a country” (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2001, p. M-4).
However, “person” is fairly broadly defined, to encompass various types of organizations and
even “associated groups.” The latter are “…two or more persons who exercise their voting
privileges in a concerted manner – by the appearance of their actions, by agreement, or by an
understanding – in order to influence the management of a business enterprise ( idem). Thus, a
little leeway seems to be left for the collectors of data, beyond the 10 % criterion, to interpret the
idea of influence.
The abandonment of the idea of control is not the only respect in which the measures of
direct investment depart from the theoretical models of the phenomenon. A single “direct
investment enterprise” can be part of several different multinational firms, possibly from several
countries. Duplication is avoided in investment flow and stock data by allocating the financial
aggregates of an affiliate to the various owners according to the extent of their ownership. In this
respect, the concerns of the producers of the balance of payments have come to outweigh those
of the analysts of firm behavior.
Another respect in which this seems to be the case, again related to balance-of-payments
definitions, is that the residence of a transactor, rather than of the ultimate owner, determines its
nationality. Thus, a firm incorporated in the United States that owns an affiliate or affiliates
outside the country, is classified as a U.S. parent company even if it is controlled by a foreign
firm. For that reason, a U.S. firm could be identified as both a U.S. parent and a U.S. affiliate of
a foreign firm. In 1994, U.S. parents “…that were ultimately controlled by a foreign parents
accounted for …11 % of the assets and for 14 % of the sales of all U.S. parents (U.S. Department
of Commerce, 1998a, p. M-7, footnote 8). If nationality is a determinant of firm behavior or,
probably more important, if status as a parent rather than an affiliate is a determinant of behavior,

6

this treatment may blur the analysis of U.S. parent activities and of the activities of foreign
affiliates of U.S. firms.
The ownership that defines the scope of a direct investment relationship includes indirect
as well as direct ownership. Direct investment enterprises include branches of a parent investor,
subsidiaries, defined as incorporated enterprises more than 50 % owned by the direct investor,
and associates, defined as incorporated enterprises owned 10-50 %. A subsidiary or associate of
a subsidiary is a direct investment enterprise of the parent, as is a subsidiary of an associate, even
though the parent’s interest could be below 10 %. An associate of an associate is not part of the
parent’s direct investment enterprise, although it is part of the first tier associate’s enterprise
(IMF, 1995, pp. 150-151). The United States requires direct and indirect ownership adding up to
at least 10 per cent (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1998a, Form BE-10B(LF)).
One type of direct investment enterprise that creates problems with the interpretation of
FDI data is what are called, in the Balance of Payments Manual, Special Purpose Entities, or
SPEs. They include such categories as “…holding company, base company, regional
headquarters …” and have as their function “…administration, management of foreign exchange
risk, facilitation of financing of investments…” and their transactions are treated in the same way
as those of other direct investment enterprises, with one exception. “…for SPEs created with a
sole purpose of serving in a financial intermediary capacity …transactions recorded under direct
investment are limited to those associated with permanent debt and equity (IMF 1993, p. 87).
Some implications of different treatments of SPEs are described later in the section on FDI
flows.

7

Scholars studying multinational firms, rather than flows of capital, have set out more
confined definitions. The early Harvard studies, under the direction of Raymond Vernon,
confined their research to firms listed among the 500 largest U.S. corporations among which
“… the U.S. parent system held equity interests in manufacturing enterprises located in 6 or
more foreign countries, such equity interest in each case amounting to 25% or more of the total
equity (Vaupel and Curhan, 1969, p. 3). Mira Wilkins (1970) defined “American multinational
enterprise” as “the U.S. headquartered company that does business in two or more foreign
countries,” and a “genuine” multinational manufacturing corporation as one that “…had direct
investments in more than just sales abroad, that adapted to and respected foreign local traditions,
and acted under foreign rules and regulations in the nations abroad where they operated” (p. ix).
Scholarly discomfort with the treatment of direct investment flows as capital flows goes
back a long time. Kindleberger (1969), in his lectures on U.S. multinationals, started out by
saying that “Direct investment used to be thought of by economists as an international capital
movement….But economists trying to interpret direct investment as a capital movement were
struck by several peculiar phenomena. In the first place, investors often failed to take money
with them when they went abroad to take control of a company; instead they would borrow in
the local market. Capital movement would take place gross…but not net. Or the investment
would take place in kind, through the exchange of property-patents, technology, or machineryagainst equity claims, without the normal transfer of funds through the foreign exchange
associated with capital movements….Direct investment may thus be capital movement, but it is
more than that (pp.1-3). The same idea, that there was something more, was expressed by John
Dunning (1970) at around the same time.”…something other than money capital is (or may be)
involved in international direct investment. This might simply be informal managerial or

8

technical guidance; on the other hand it could incorporate the dissemination of valuable
knowledge and/or entrepreneurship in the form of research and development, production
technology, marketing skills, managerial expertise, and so on; none of which usually
accompanies investment” (p. 4).
What is a parent?
A multinational firm consists of a parent firm and the affiliates it owns or controls. Most of the
home country surveys from which we know about FDI are surveys of affiliates. Very few
countries make any effort to survey their parent firms, the main exceptions being The United
States, Sweden, and Japan. Surveys by host countries, usually taking the form of tagging
foreign-owned establishments in their economic censuses, rarely ask anything about parent firms
except their nationality. Again, the United States is an exception in that a few other questions
about parents are included in the inward surveys, including the name of the parent and its
industry.
The term, “parent,” was used in the 1950 U.S. outward survey to describe “…the owners
of a reportable interest…” in foreign-owned corporations and “…collectively, individual holders
of stock which in total constituted a reportable interest,” which, for individual holders in that
survey, was 50 % (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1953, p. 36). The individual holders’
investments accounted for about 10 % of the total. The other 90 % was referred to as the value
of investments by “reporters” (ibid, Appendix Table 10).
The 1966 U.S. outward investment survey was much more explicit about the domestic
side of the multinationals. It was the first to include a form specifically relating to the U.S. firm
involved, referring to it as the “reporter,” rather than the parent firm. Information was collected
on the reporter’s industry, type of organization, assets, liabilities, net income, R&D expenditures,
9

and natural resource exploration and development costs. The reporter was explicitly instructed
to include in its answers data for “domestic subsidiaries or affiliates operating in the United
States and usually part of the reporter’s consolidation” (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1975, p.
243). However, no information was requested for any firm of which the reporter was a
subsidiary, a serious omission that was corrected in the 1977 survey.
The 1977 U.S. outward survey elevated the role of the parent to something more like
equality with that of affiliates, requiring a much fuller set of data and defining the parent more
broadly and consistently from an economic point of view. Although the term “reporter’ was still
used in the forms, the instructions referred explicitly referred to the “U.S. Parent.” The major
change in definition was to require consolidation in the parent reports. It required an
incorporated U.S. parent to be “the U.S. parent corporation whose voting securities are not
owned more than 50 % by another U.S. corporation,” and including “down each ownership chain
from that U.S. corporation any U.S. corporation…whose voting securities are more than 50 %
owned by the U.S. corporation above it” (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1981, pp. 3-4). The
problem that the change in definition was intended to solve was that the reporters in earlier
surveys were sometimes U.S. corporations’ holding company subsidiaries that had been created
specifically to own foreign operations, but had no domestic operations of their own. Treating
these as parents would give a distorted picture of the relationships between U.S. parent and
foreign affiliate operations. One result of the change was that the “parents” of 1977 and later
years are not comparable to the “reporters” of 1966, and comparisons of “reporter” data for 1966
with “parent” data for later years are biased.
Parents, as defined in U.S. data, are almost certainly not comparable to parents as
reported in Japanese data. Consolidation of company accounts is less common in Japan than in

10

the United States, and there is no way to be sure that the reporting parents are not just fragments
of much larger conglomerates. The Swedish surveys, which have been collected by a private
research organization, do ask for consolidated reports by parent firms. Unlike the U.S. outward
investment surveys they exclude Swedish firms that are affiliates of foreign firms and also
foreign investment undertaken by private individuals (Swedenborg, 1979, pp. 244-245).

What is an FDI Flow?
The definition of FDI flows has changed over time as the definition of FDI enterprises has
changed. One such change for the United States, for example, was the elimination from the U.S.
outward direct investment universe of foreign firms with large, but diffused, ownership by U.S.
citizens. That reclassification resulted in the reclassification of the investment flows to and from
these firms as portfolio investment and the elimination of the retained earnings of these firms
from the U.S. accounts altogether. However, when the change in definition was adopted, in
1977, it was not carried back to earlier years, so that historical flow data reflect the earlier
definition of FDI.
Direct investment capital flows are made up of “… equity capital, reinvested earnings,
and other capital associated with various intercompany debt transactions” (IMF, 1993, p. 87).
The last category is the most troublesome, covering “…the borrowing and lending of funds including debt securities and suppliers’ credits – between direct investors and subsidiaries,
branches, and associates.” The latter includes “…Intercompany transactions between affiliated
banks (depository institutions) and affiliated financial intermediaries (e.g.,security dealers) –
including SPEs with the sole purpose of serving as financial intermediaries…” However, the
latter are now to be included in direct investment only if they are “…associated with permanent

11

debt (loan capital representing a permanent interest) and equity (share capital) investment or, in
the case of branches, fixed assets. Deposits and other claims and liabilities related to usual
banking transactions of depositary institutions and claims and liabilities of other financial
intermediaries are classified, as appropriate, under portfolio investment or other investment (IMF
1993, p.88). This last distinction was in recognition of the ambiguities that had developed in the
division of investment between direct investment and other types.
In 1998, the BEA made a major change in the treatment of U.S, affiliates that were
primarily financial intermediaries, “…established mainly to facilitate the foreign securities and
financing businesses of their U.S. parents or to facilitate foreign borrowing by their U.S.
parents….” The capital flows associated with these activities were “…sizable and volatile.” No
lasting interest or desire to influence the management of an enterprise was involved in these
transactions and it was decided that they should be treated as portfolio flows rather than direct
investment flows. This treatment was described as in accord with the IMF guidelines mentioned
above. It involved three groups of U.S. affiliates “…that had characteristics of financial
intermediaries: (1) Financial affiliates located in the Netherlands Antilles, (2) financial affiliates
whose U.S. parents are depository institutions, and (3) financial affiliates whose U.S. parents are
securities dealers” (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1998b, pp. 119-120).
The effect of the revised treatment was substantial. In 1997, for example, the net outflow
of direct investment from the United States was reduced by $11 billion, leaving a revised total of
$119 billion after other adjustments. The inward flow was reduced by $54 billion, leaving a
revised total of $108 billion. A similar change was made on the inward investment side,
excluding intercompany debt positions with financial affiliates whose ultimate beneficial owners
were depositary institutions or finance or insurance firms (Bach, 1998, p. 52).

12

A major effect of the change was on the reported volatility of FDI flows. These financial
intermediary flows fluctuated far more widely than the remaining FDI flows, at least in 19941997, the period for which the revisions were published. On the outward investment side, the
changes in the financial intermediary flow ranged from a negative $2 billion to a positive $11
billion, while the revised total, excluding the financial intermediaries, varied from negative $75
billion to negative $122 billion, with no changes of direction. On the inward side, the financial
intermediary flows, all negative, ranged from $-1 billion to $-54 billion, while the revised flows
(inflows), excluding the intermediaries, all positive, increased in every year, from $46 to $108
billion (Bach, 1998, Table 3).
Another way of describing the volatility of the financial intermediary flows is by
comparing the average annual changes to the average annual flows. The average annual change
in the outward flow for the financial intermediaries was over 100% of the average flow for the
period, while the average change in the adjusted outflow was only 16% of the average adjusted
outflow. On the inward side, the average change in the intermediaries’ inflow was 120% of the
average inflow while the average change in the inflows excluding the intermediaries was 24% of
the average adjusted inflow. Thus, the financial intermediaries’ flows were 5 to 6 times as
volatile as the rest of the direct investment flows.
The question of how to treat financial intermediary subsidiaries was not a new one. The
United States outward investment total for many years showed a negative investment in the
Netherlands Antilles that reached a peak of $-25 billion in 1984. That was 12 % of the reported
outward direct investment total, and over 40 % of the reported investment in trade and services,
excluding petroleum services (Lipsey, 1988, Table 8.A.1). These large investments in the
Netherlands Antilles were a result of the U.S. withholding tax on interest paid by U.S. firms on

13

borrowing abroad. U. S. parent firms set up affiliates in the Netherlands Antilles to borrow in
European capital markets, free of the tax on interest payments, and relend the proceeds to their
parents. In this way, a portfolio flow, mainly bond issues, was magically converted into a direct
investment flow by passing through the affiliates. Since the direct investment flow was of parent
firms borrowing from their affiliates, it became a negative element in the U.S. outward
investment position.
Do Investment Stocks Reflect the Economic Activity of Multinational Firms?
The only virtually universal measure of the activities of multinational firms outside their home
countries is the amount of direct investment, or the “direct investment position,” of a country, as
calculated from direct investment stock data or cumulated flows of direct investment. These are
the FDI data derived from balance of payments statistics. They do not purport to measure the
size of multinational firms or their foreign affiliates, or their activities in their host countries.
They measure only the value of the parent firms’ financial stakes in their foreign affiliates.
However, because of their wide coverage of countries, they are often used in analyses of the
impacts of MNC activities on, for example, trade, or host country, home country, or parent
employment or output.
Given this use of one concept of FDI to represent another, it would be useful to know
how closely the investment position data are related to, for example, the economic activity of
affiliates. One reason to expect that the relation might not be close is that the investment
position data are based on the immediate sources and destinations of investment. In contrast,
U.S. surveys of the operations of U.S. firms abroad and foreign firms in the United States are
based on the ultimate sources and final destinations of investment. An example of the difference
is that, for example, of 234 affiliates in the United States with ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs)
14

that were Italian in 1987, 74 reported that their immediate parent was in a country other than
Italy. Of 19 affiliates with South African UBOs, 17 reported other immediate parentage and of
123 affiliates of Saudi Arabian UBOs, 105 reported other parent locations (U.S. Department of
Commerce, 2001, p. M-12).
The same problem could affect the industry distribution of investment positions and
affiliate activities. The investment position may report a holding company in an intermediate
country as the source or destination of an investment that originated in an industrial firm or is
intended for an industrial affiliate. The problem has become more serious over time because
“…U.S. parent companies have been funneling an increasing share of their direct investments
abroad through holding companies. In 1982, foreign affiliates classified as holding companies
accounted for only 9 percent of the U.S. direct investment position abroad, but by 2000, they
accounted for 23 percent…” (Borga and Mataloni, 2001, p. 23).
Another problem with the reported stocks of FDI is that they are mostly cumulations of
past direct investment flows and take no account of changes in currency values and asset values
since the original investments were made. One exception to this is the FDI stock estimates for
the United States, which come in three variants, historical cost, current cost, and market value.
They all take account of currency value changes and, as is explained later, the current cost
estimates take account of price changes on fixed assets and the market value estimates take
account of equity price changes.
An examination of the relation of FDI stock to FDI activity was performed for the United
States, the only country for which the comparison can be made by industry and location for a
variety of activity measures (United Nations, 2000b, Annex D). It showed that in 1989, the
distribution of the U.S. outward FDI stock across host countries was strongly correlated with the

15

distribution of affiliate sales. The distribution of the U.S. inward FDI stock across countries of
origin was similarly well correlated with the sales and employment of those countries’ affiliates
in the United States. However, changes in the country distribution of U.S. outward FDI were not
closely related to changes in the location of sales and employment. The country distribution of
changes in inward investment was weakly related to changes in the country distribution of
employment(r =.37) and not related at all to changes in the country distribution of sales (r= .015).
Thus it appeared that the country distributions of outward and inward investment stocks in one
year were related to the country distributions of sales and employment, but changes in country
distributions were poor indicators of changes in employment and sales.
Tests of the relation of the outward stock of FDI to measures of FDI activity for recent
years are reported in Appendix Tables 7 through 10. If one wished to estimate the distribution of
factor inputs or sales across both countries and industries from data on FDI stocks, the results
would be quite inaccurate. Across 12 industry groups and 58 countries, less than 30 % of the
variation is explained, even for sales. 16 % is explained for property plant, and equipment
(PP&E), and 10 % for employment (Appendix Table 8). Thus, while the distributions of
aggregate FDI stocks, and stocks within broad industries, are fairly well related to the
distributions of input and sales measures across countries, they are only weakly related to the
distributions across even broad industry groups. For a finer level of industry detail, 63 industries
and nine countries, only about 10 % of the variation in sales is explained, and the relationship is
even weaker for PP&E (4 %) and employment (2 %).
Absolute changes in aggregate and total manufacturing U.S. outward direct investment
stocks between 1982 and 1998 are quite closely related, across countries, to absolute changes in
affiliate PPE and sales (Appendix Table 9), but the relations are much weaker for relative

16

changes in these variables. Again, if we examine the relationships across both countries and
broad industry groups, or across country groups and detailed industries, they fall apart. None of
the rsqs is above .30 and most are below .20 (Appendix Table 10).
Thus, while the investment stocks tell us something about the country of location of FDI
activity or changes in it, in the aggregate and within industries, they tell us very little about what
kind of activity is taking place, or what they tell us is often wrong.
3. History
A Brief History of FDI and its Importance in International Capital Flows
FDI is sometimes thought of as originating with American firms, and some of its characteristics
as we know it today developed mainly in American companies. However, Mira Wilkins has
called attention to its antecedents far back in history. “…in 2500 B.C., Sumerian merchants
found in their foreign commerce that they needed men stationed abroad to receive, to store, and
to sell their goods…the East India Company, chartered in London in 1600, established branches
overseas…In the mid-seventeenth century, English, French, and Dutch mercantile families sent
relatives to America and to the West Indies to represent their firms. So too, in time, American
colonists found in their own foreign trade that it was desirable to have correspondents, agents,
and, on occasion, branch houses in important trading centers to warehouse and to sell American
exports…” (1970, p. 1).
Wilkins describes the Virginia Company, chartered by King James I in 1606 to establish
the first permanent English settlement at Jamestown, as “…the first foreign direct investment in
America…” (1989, p. 6). By 1624 it was bankrupt. She identifies 1875-1914 as the period of
“…the rise of truly large-scale foreign investments in the private sector” (p. 609) including
“…more foreign direct investments than most subsequent commentaries have recognized” (p.

17

613). Wilkins divides direct investments into two types. “One involved investments that carried
the potentials of control, but had a fragile, negligible, sometimes virtually nonexistent ‘home
office’ organization with little capacity beyond that of raising capital. These companies had no
experience in operations at home to project abroad…. The second type of direct investment, akin
to today’s multinational enterprises, provided the extension into the United States of a company
and its operating organizational talents- its own ‘ package’ of skills, experience, technology,
management, and marketing experience” (pp. 613-614).
In view of the current interest in multinationals and direct investment, it is striking that
they play a minor role in descriptions of the period before 1913, the time of perhaps the largest
total international investment flows in history, relative to output and fixed investment. Most
writings about capital movements either did not mention direct investment at all (Iverson, 1936)
or treated it as a minor form of international investment. Hobson (1914, p. 25) did describe
“…an enormous rise in the importance of the international company, in railways, mining,
tramways, water, gas, electricity, banking, insurance, finance, land plantations…” and even
manufacturing, “…but there it is still somewhat rare.” The consensus was probably well
summarized by Arthur Bloomfield’s appraisal that “portfolio investment was a far more
important component of long-term capital movements before 1914 than direct investment”
(1968, p. 3). He noted one exception, China, among developing country recipients of
investment, and one, the United States, among developed country investors. Another exception
was apparently Japan as an investor, the counterpart of China as a recipient, as indicated in a
number of sources cited in Wilkins (1986, pp. 3-4). Bloomfield suggested that before 1914, “…
the concept of direct investment (in its present-day sense) was not clearly distinguished from
other (noncontrolling) equity investments in foreign private enterprises (Bloomfield, pp. 3-4).

18

Svedberg (1978) challenged the idea that direct investment flows to developing countries
were negligible before 1914. He claimed that it was an illusion stemming from the typical
methods of estimating investment flows and stocks. These relied heavily on public flotations of
securities and therefore missed many direct investments that did not pass through such
exchanges. Svedberg estimated that some 44 to 60 % of the $19 billion of accumulated
investment in developing countries in 1913-14 was in the form of direct investment. Mira
Wilkins, too, argued that “foreign direct investments… have often been shortchanged in the
literature of U.S. economic history…” (1989, p.xi).
For more recent years, the International Monetary Fund has published comprehensive
worldwide estimates of gross and net flows of direct investment since 1970, gross flows of
portfolio and other investment since 1980, and net flows since 1970. Portfolio investment
includes equity securities, debt securities in the form of bonds, money market instruments, and
financial derivatives, such as options, all excluding any of these included in direct investment or
reserve assets. The category of “Other investment” includes trade credit, loans, financial leases,
The data on gross direct investment flows indicate that direct investment has been an
increasing part of total investment flows since the 1970s and early 1980s, when they were less
than 15 %. By the first half of the 1990s they accounted for 30 % of total outflows and they
stayed at that level in the second half of the decade (Table 1). The largest source of gross direct
investment flows since the 1980s has been Europe, followed by the United States. Japan was the
next major source until the 1990s, when it was overtaken and passed by Developing Asia
(Lipsey, 1999, Appendix Table 6A.2 and Appendix Table 2 of this paper). A large part of
European outflows has stayed within Europe; inflows into Europe were more than half of
outflows in the 1970s and 1980s (Lipsey, 1999, Appendix Tables 6A.2 and 6A.3). That pattern

19

persisted into the 1990s, with inflows two thirds or more of outflows (Appendix Tables 2 and 3).
The United States, too, has been a major recipient of direct investment inflows, with the result
that its former position as a major net provider of direct investment to other countries has almost
disappeared. In the 1980s the United States was a net recipient of direct investment from abroad,
turned back to being a net supplier in the early 1990s, and again became a net recipient in the
second half of the 1990s. Europe and Japan were more consistent, both being net suppliers,
while Developing Asia and Latin America were steady net recipients (Lipsey, 1999, Appendix
Table 6A4 and Appendix Table 4 of this paper). Thus, a large part of the gross flows of direct
investment are among the developed countries.
It is difficult to compare gross or net flows of direct investment with fixed capital
expenditures for the world as a whole, but a comparison can be made for the OECD countries.
Among 22 countries from 1970 through 1995, the average ratios of inward FDI flows to gross
fixed capital formation were below 10 % in 20 countries, and they were below 5 % in most of the
countries. When gross inflows in a five-year period were related to fixed capital formation in the
subsequent five-year period, the coefficient was negative, although not statistically significant. It
did not appear that FDI inflows were a major source of financing for capital formation in these
countries. Gross outflows were negatively and significantly related to capital formation in the
following period, but net flows were not related to capital formation at all (Lipsey, 2001). Thus
there is some suggestion that outward direct investment competes with domestic plant and
equipment expenditures for funds, as was found also for a group of U.S. companies by Stevens
and Lipsey (1992), but it is surprising that neither gross nor net inward FDI flows offset that
competition.

20

Another way of judging the importance of FDI in the world economy is to ask how much
of world production and employment are accounted for by the foreign operations that result from
FDI, or “internationalized production.” In the late 1950s, when a large part of the outward stock
of FDI was owned by U.S. firms, internationalized production might have represented about 2 %
of world output. By the late 1970s or early 1980s, after the period of rapid growth in U.S.owned production abroad, the share reached 5 %. As U.S. firms’ operations abroad were
reduced in the 1980s, those of other countries, particularly Germany and Japan, increased, but
the pace of internationalization for the world as a whole was slower. In the 1990s, American
firms resumed the growth of their overseas activities and the worldwide pace of
internationalization rose again. By the late 1990s, about 8 % of world production was
internationalized (United Nations 2000b).
These shares of output may not appear as large as one might expect from the volume of
discussion of “globalization.” One reason for a different impression is that direct investment and
the resulting production are concentrated in two visible and closely watched sectors,
manufacturing and petroleum. In the case of the United States, for example, in the mid-1990s,
these sectors accounted for about 18 % of GDP, but for three quarters of U.S.-owned overseas
production. U.S.-owned affiliate production abroad was about 17 % of home production in
manufacturing, 100 % in petroleum, but only 2 % in all the other industries combined, which
accounted for over 80 % of total U.S. output (Lipsey, 1998). Since the manufacturing and
petroleum sectors are the source of most tradables, multinational firms account for a large
proportion of international goods trade. In manufacturing, for example, exports by
manufacturing affiliates of firms the United States, Japan, and Sweden, were about 10 % of
world manufactured exports in the mid-1990s. Since those three countries accounted for only

21

about a third of the stock of outward FDI, if their affiliates’ export propensities were not far from
the average, the total internationalized share of manufactured exports might be somewhere
around 30 %.
In mining, of which petroleum is a large part, the output of foreign affiliates of U.S. firms
alone was almost a quarter of world output in 1977, but fell below 20 % by 1990. The decline
was much larger in developing countries, from 23 to 10 % (Mataloni and Goldberg, 1994, and
United Nations, 1993), as several Middle Eastern countries nationalized what had formerly been
U.S.-owned properties.
The share of internationalized production in world manufacturing output is much higher
than the share in total output. It was about 11&1/2 % in 1977, when the share in total output was
around 5 %. By 1990 it was over 16 % when the share in total output was less than half of that,
and it has probably risen somewhat since then (Lipsey, 1998, pp. 12-13).
The share of world employment absorbed by internationalized production is far smaller
than the share of production itself. It was probably not much above 1 % in the late 1990s, as
compared with 8 % for production. The implication is obviously that output per worker was
seven or eight times as high in internationalized production as in world production in general, the
consequence of some combination of greater capital intensity and higher productivity (United
Nations 2000b).

The United States as a Direct Investor and Recipient of Direct Investment
The United States has been, since its earliest days as a foreign investor, exceptionally focused on
direct investment. Frank Southard, in one of the first studies of U.S. direct investment,
commented about that early start. “…it was the two decades just prior to the opening of the

22

present century (the 20th) that saw a startling development: the export of capital in significant
amounts by American corporations for the establishment of European plants and sales
organizations at a time when the United States was steadily importing capital” ( 1931,p. xiii). In
1897, the United States, still predominantly a net recipient of capital from abroad, rather than a
supplier of capital, held more than 90 % of its outward investment in the form of direct
investment (Lewis, 1938, p. 605). By 1914, that share had declined to three quarters, but it was
still far above the proportion in foreign investment in the United States (ibid), and in worldwide
investment. World War I was the beginning of major U.S. portfolio investment abroad, much of
it in the form of loans to foreign governments that exceeded private financing. By the end of the
war, in 1919, direct investment had been reduced to a little over half of U.S. private investment
abroad, and to less than a quarter of total investment, including intergovernmental loans (ibid, p.
447). Both direct and portfolio investment grew rapidly during the 1920s, but that period
differed from earlier ones in that portfolio investment accounted for a majority of the outward
flow. By 1929, the value of U.S. private portfolio investment abroad was greater than that of
direct investment for the first time (Lewis, pp. 450, 605).
The Great Depression of the 1930s reversed this movement toward the portfolio form that
had taken place in the 1920s. Half of the foreign loans extended in the late 1920s went into
default (Mintz, 1951, p. 6). U.S. holdings of securities of securities, even valued at par rather
than market, were reduced by almost 30 %, or by almost 50 % if defaulted bonds were valued at
market prices. Short-term credits were also reduced almost by half (Lewis, 1938, p. 454). By
1940 direct investment again accounted for more than half of U.S. private investment abroad, and
that remained true through 1970 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, series U26-U39).
U.S. government loans to foreign countries had expanded again during World War II and by

23

1950 the stock of such loans was almost twice the total private investment stock. Thus the
restored dominance of direct investment in 1950 applied only to private investment.
By the late 1970s, the stock of direct investment, measured in the traditional way at book,
or historical cost values, had fallen to between 40 and 50 % of total private investment abroad,
where other types of assets were measured at market values, where possible (Table 2). There was
some suspicion that historical cost valuation might seriously distort the valuation of direct
investment, and in 1991, the BEA began to offer two alternative valuation methods (Landefeld
and Lawson, 1991). One, referred to as “current-cost” valuation, attempted to apply inflation
accounting to the asset side of the balance sheets of U.S.-owned affiliates abroad and foreignowned affiliates in the United States. The tangible assets of affiliates were revalued, using a
perpetual inventory calculation for plant and equipment and current price indexes for other forms
of tangible capital.

The “market valuation” method revalues, instead, the equity part of the

parent’s investment in affiliates, using broad stock price indexes for foreign countries and the
United States.
By the current cost valuation, the share of direct investment in U.S. private investment
abroad was still close to 60 % in the late 1970s as compared with about 45 % by the historical
valuation (Table 2). After that, the direct investment share fell, almost continuously, to about one
quarter in 1997-99. Although the share fell in almost every year, most of the decline took place in
the burst of portfolio and short-term lending that took place before and during the Latin American
crisis of the early 1980s. Both the current-cost and historical valuations showed a direct
investment share of 20 to 25 % in U.S. outward investment in the late 1990s, but the market value
share, propelled by the rise in stock prices, produced a direct investment share of 35-40 % (Table
2). Some part of the reduction in the share of direct investment in the outward stock of private

24

foreign investment stemmed from large upward revisions, by about 30 %, in the estimates for
purchases of foreign securities. The revisions stemmed mainly from two sources. One was a
U.S. Treasury Benchmark Survey of U.S. Portfolio Investment Abroad at yearend 1997, which
indicated a 20 % discrepancy between previous estimates and the survey results in the brief period
since the previous survey in 1994. The other was an adjustment for U.S. portfolio investment that
took place in the course of foreign acquisitions of U.S. firms, when the purchasing firms paid U.S.
stockholders with stock in the foreign acquirers (Bach, 2000, pp. 70-72).
Not only did the United States have an exceptional share of its foreign investment in
direct investment, but it also accounted for a large part of the world’s stock of outward direct
investment. In 1960, almost half of the world’s outward stock of direct investment was owned by
investors based in the United States. No other country came close to that share; the next ranking
holder was the UK, at 18 %, followed by the Netherlands at 10 % and France at 6 % (United
Nations, 1988, Table 1.2). By 1999, the U.S. share had fallen to less than a quarter. The UK, The
Netherlands, and France remained important, the first two with reduced shares. Germany and
Japan, with only 2 % of the total between them in 1960, accounted for 15 % in 1999. Even
developing countries, which had been the homes for only 3 % of the outward stock as late as
1980, owned 10 % of it in 1999 (United Nations, 2000a). Thus, the ability of firms to operate in
foreign countries had become much more widely diffused among home countries over those 40
years.
Another indicator of that diffusion was the change in the direct investment balance of the
United States. In the late 1970s, U.S. direct investment abroad was about four times the value of
foreign direct investment in the United States, both measured at current values. By 1997-99,
foreign direct investment in the United States had reached over three quarters of the level of U.S.

25

direct investment abroad. The net U.S. direct investment position, which had been a little over
$200 billion in 1977-79, was only about $240 billion in 1997-99, when gross outward investment
was five times as large.
4. Data On Foreign Direct Investment
There are two general types of data on foreign direct investment. One is the financial data from
balance-of –payments accounting. These record inward and outward flows of direct investment
and the resulting stocks. The stocks are the value of stocks of direct investment outside each
home country owned by residents of that country and the value of stocks in each country that are
owned by residents of other countries.
The second type of data is on the operations of FDI affiliates in their host countries and
the operations of their parents in their home countries. Operations could include their sales,
production, employment, wages, assets, expenditures for plant and equipment, and R&D
expenditures. None of these characteristics are revealed by the financial data from the balanceof-payments. They are obtained from surveys of parent companies, in their home countries, or ,
in their host countries, from surveys of affiliates, often by identifying foreign-owned
establishments in economic censuses.

Data on FDI Flows and Stocks
The only data on direct investment that cover virtually all countries are the balance of payments,
or financial data. These are reported to the International Monetary Fund and are published, for
example, in IMF (2000a). The reports are separated into outward (“Abroad”) and inward (In
Reporting Economy”) flows, divided between reinvested earnings and other direct investment
flows. Notes are provided explaining the sources of data for each country. In the past, many

26

countries did not record reinvested earnings, but coverage has improved in recent years. The
worldwide discrepancy between outward and inward direct investment flows, which should be
zero if all flows were recorded fully and consistently by both sides, has been no higher than 8% in
any year from 1993 to 1999, as contrasted with 40 or 50% for portfolio investment.
The Balance of Payments Yearbooks also call for the reporting of inward and outward
stocks of direct investment, as part of their tabulations of the international investment position of
each country. Most developed countries report their inward and outward stocks of FDI, but many
developing countries do not. The IMF data, in summary form, are also available in International
Financial Statistics, for example, IMF (2000b).
The quality of international data on FDI flows for measuring what is called for in balance
of payments accounting was reviewed in IMF (1986) as part of the search for an explanation and
cure for the enormous world balance of payments discrepancies. The world current account
discrepancy did fall for a while, but it returned to well over negative $100 billion in 1999 (IMF
2000a). The discrepancy for direct investment, which had been fairly small during most of the
1990s, jumped to $64 billion in 1999, about 7&1/2 % of the reported outflow.
A deficiency of all the IMF compilations is that political considerations apparently dictate
the omission of data for two important entities, Taiwan, and until 1998, Hong Kong. However,
Taiwan does publish its data in the IMF format.
A source of inward and outward FDI flow and stock data that covers almost all countries
is the UNCTAD World Investment Report (WIR), for example, United Nations (2000a). These
reports began with United Nations (1973), (1978), (1983), and (1988), and have been published
annually since 1991. They provide annual data from 1990 to 1999 and at five-year intervals
before that. There are also extensive notes on sources and listings of items omitted in various

27

countries’ reports. Annex B includes listings for each country covered indicating what items are
omitted, sources of data, and major revisions. There are also tables of ratios of FDI flows to
Gross Capital Formation and of FDI stocks to GDP. In contrast to the IMF reports, the WIR has
consistently included information on FDI in and by Taiwan and Hong Kong.
A source of financial data on FDI that covers quite a few countries is the OECD
International Direct Investment Statistics Yearbook, covering 28 countries in its latest edition
(OECD 2000), although not with complete data for all of them. It includes data on inflows and
outflows and on inward and outward stocks, or the “direct investment position.” A major
advantage over the compilations of the IMF and UNCTAD is that there are data for most
countries by broad industrial sectors and also by partner country, in a uniform format.
Data on direct investment flows and the international direct investment position of the
United States are published regularly in articles in the Survey of Current Business and have been
summarized in a series of publications by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The period
beginning in 1950 was covered, with substantial country detail, and a little industry information,
especially starting in 1966, in U.S. Department of Commerce (1982). Recent editions have
included greater industry detail.
The traditional way of measuring inward and outward investment stocks at historical
valuations came under increasing criticism in the 1980s. It did not take account of changes in
prices and did not match the treatment of fixed capital in the U.S. National Income and Product
Accounts. As a result, the BEA, in 1991, began to publish its U.S. investment position data in
two alternative valuations, as mentioned earlier. One was a “current-cost” valuation, in which
inflation accounting was applied to the assets of U.S. affiliates abroad and foreign affiliates in the
United States. Affiliate tangible assets were revalued using a perpetual inventory calculation for

28

plant and equipment and current price indexes for other types of tangible capital. The other
method, described as “market valuation,” revalues, instead, the liability side, in particular, the
equity portion of the parent investment in affiliates. It uses broad equity price indexes for foreign
countries to value the equity portion of U.S. assets abroad and equity price indexes for the United
States to value the equity portion of foreign assets in the United States.
As is pointed out in the article announcing the new measures (Landefeld and Lawson,
1991), there are limitations to these measures, although not as great as those of the historical
valuations. The new measures are the only ones now reported in the articles on the international
investment position of the United States. The inward investment measures at current cost are
probably the most accurate of the four, two inward and two outward. The BEA produces price
measures for U.S. plant and equipment expenditures, and the only possibly major problem is that
the composition of plant and equipment expenditures by foreign affiliates in the United States is
not known in detail and could differ from that of other firms in the United States. The outward
investment measure at current cost must make do with available foreign price indexes for capital
goods. These do not exist for all the host countries, and even where they do, are not collected and
calculated in comparable ways. The market value measures rely on the assumption that the
market values of what are mainly privately-owned companies follow those of broad stock price
indexes. The composition of these indexes may differ substantially with respect to industry,
country, in the case of outward investment, and in other respects from the composition of the
equities that are part of direct investment.

29

Data on FDI Operations
The balance of payments data suffer from two incurable problems. One is that, as described
earlier, they trace only the immediate sources and destinations of investment, rather than the
ultimate ones. A more serious one is that they contain no information on the economic activity
of FDI affiliates and their parents. Thus they tell nothing about the characteristics of the parents,
such as their industry, their size, employment, sales, assets, or technological activities. It is
therefore difficult to use them to study the reasons for companies to invest in production abroad
or the choices they make in such investing. The financial data also tell nothing about the
economic activities of the affiliates. It is therefore difficult to use them to analyze the impacts of
the affiliates’ operations on their host countries or on the parents and their home countries. The
only possible sources of information on the operations of parents are surveys carried out in their
home countries. Information on the operations of affiliates can be collected from surveys of
parent firms in their home countries or my surveys of affiliates in the host countries, done either
specifically to examine foreign-owned operations or as part of economic censuses by tagging
foreign-owned firms or establishments.
The most comprehensive data, by far, on FDI operations are those for the United States.
Annual data on the operations of both U.S. nonbank affiliates abroad and foreign nonbank
affiliates in the United States are published in articles in the Survey of Current Business. More
complete data, and particularly more U.S. parent data, are published in reports published every
year by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The most complete sets of information,
include banking, appear in the BEA’s benchmark surveys, which are usually conducted every

30

five years. The latest inward survey is U.S. Department of Commerce (2001), covering 1997,
and the latest outward survey is U.S. Department of Commerce (1998a).
Among the items included are balance sheets, income accounts, employment, exports, to
affiliates and to others, imports, and R&D expenditures and employment. The benchmark
surveys include more topics and more country and industry detail than the annual surveys.
The United States also provides measures of the production, or gross product, of U.S.
parents and affiliates and of foreign affiliates in the United States. That measure of FDI activity
is preferable to sales or employment, partly because of its comparability with national accounts
concepts, such as GDP. For U.S. affiliates abroad it is calculated for only majority-owned ones
(MOFAs), because the survey form for other affiliates, which account for between 12 and 17 %
of total activity, depending on the measure used, lacks the required information (U.S.
Department of Commerce, 2000c, Tables II.A-1 and III.A-1).
The estimates are built up by summation of factor costs and indirect taxes rather than by
subtraction of intermediate inputs from gross output. They match the gross product measures in
the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs) fairly well in concept. One difference is
that depreciation is reported only at book value instead of the NIPA’s current value, using
economic service lives and replacement cost valuation (Mataloni and Goldberg, 1994, p. 42).
The effect is on the distinction between depreciation and profits within affiliates, rather than on
total gross profit.
On the inward side, the BEA and the Census Bureau have matched reporting firm
identifications to identify foreign-owned U.S. establishments They can thus provide U.S.
economic census establishment data divided between domestically-owned and foreign-owned
establishments. These have been published for 1987 and 1992 for most U.S. industries, in U.S.

31

Department of Commerce (1992) and (1997), and the linked data for 1997 are expected to be
published in 2002. For years between 1987 and 1992, only manufacturing is covered, in a series
of annual publications. The industry and geographical detail are extensive, but only a few items
such as numbers of establishments, employment, and wages, are reported. An important
distinction between these data and the BEA survey data is that the matched data are on an
establishment basis, rather than an enterprise basis. A large enterprise often combines
establishments belonging to several industries, possibly including both manufacturing and
wholesale trade or manufacturing and mining, in the case of petroleum, the establishment data
provide a more accurate account of the industry distribution of foreign-owned employment,
sales, and other variables.
A broader assessment of the quality of U.S. data on FDI, dealing with concepts as well as
arithmetic accuracy, is given in Stekler and Stevens (1991).
The OECD has begun to publish some data for inward investment operations in member
countries, in, for example, OECD (1999). Response is not complete, but the publication attempts
to cover numbers of foreign-owned enterprises and their production, turnover, value added,
wages and salaries, R&D expenditures and employment, and trade.
Operations by Swedish firms abroad beginning in 1965 can be studied from surveys
conducted at approximately five-year intervals by the Industriens Utredningsinstitut of Stockholm
(now known as The Research Institute of Industrial Economics). Publications reporting on these
surveys are listed in the references to Swedenborg (2001). The surveys included questions on
employment, wages, fixed capital, trade, R&D expenditures, and other topics, mostly relating to
foreign affiliates, but with some information about parents and about the relations between
parents and affiliates..

32

The Swedish Central Bureau of Statistics (Statistics Sweden) has been publishing data
starting in 1990 on employment at home and abroad in Swedish-owned enterprise groups having
subsidiaries abroad. The data are reported by detailed industry and by country, but not crossclassified, except to distinguish manufacturing from service industries (Sweden, Statistics
Sweden, 2000a). A survey of R&D expenditures and R&D personnel input in Sweden and abroad
in the twenty largest Swedish manufacturing groups and in foreign-owned enterprises in Sweden
was conducted for 1997 (Sweden, Statistics Sweden, 2001).
A limited report on operations of foreign firms in Sweden was published annually by the
Central Bureau of Statistics, starting with 1987. A much more extensive survey and analysis for
1970 appears in Samuelsson (1977). Beginning in 1994, the scope of reporting was expanded,
although the survey remained voluntary. As in the outward survey, the main question is on
employment, classified by industry and country of origin (Sweden, Statistics Sweden, 2000b).
For 1997, a supplementary report included data on profits, liquidity, exports and export intensity,
and value added (Sweden, Statistics Sweden, 2000c).
Information on the operations of both German firms abroad and foreign firms in
Germany is has been published in a series of reports by the Deutsche Bundesbank, at two-year
intervals, such as in Deutsche Bundesbank (1999). The country and industry detail are extensive,
but the list of variables is short, limited to numbers of firms, employment, annual turnover, and
assets, with some breakdown by type of asset.
For Japan, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI, now METI), has
published a series of annual and benchmark surveys of outward FDI since the 1970s. They
contain a great deal of information on parent and affiliate operations, but suffer from low
response, fluctuating over time and varying, within a survey, from question to question. The

33

coverage and other quality aspects of these surveys have been discussed in Ramstetter (1996), and
some of the individual MITI publications are listed there.
Recently, there have been efforts, supported by Japanese official agencies, to improve the
quality of the MITI data. A paper by Fukao, Yuan, and Sakishita (1999) estimated missing data
from survey forms to produce better approximations to total employment and sales by Japanese
affiliates and their distribution over host countries and industries.
The United Kingdom does not conduct regular surveys of its firms’ outward FDI
activities. A major one- time survey was conducted for the Reddaway (1967) and (1968) reports,
but it was not repeated. Inward FDI activities can be followed by using economic census data,
where foreign ownership is tagged.
France does not publish any readily available public data on the outward FDI activities of
its firms. The French government has issued, since the 1970s, a series of reports on numbers of
foreign-owned firms and their employment, wages, capital, and exports and, for each measure, the
share in the French economy. The data are disaggregated by industry, country of origin, and
location within France. The latest report, covering January 1, 1998, was summarized in France,
SESSI (2000).
Canada is one of the world’s major recipients of FDI and has a long history of collecting
data on it, mainly on sales, exports, imports, and financial aspects. An early survey for 1964 and
1965 was published in Canada (1967). Employment, hours of work, and wages were added in
some later surveys, such as Canada (1979), but the main source of data remains the reports under
the Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act, published by Statistics Canada in recent years.
For the period of operation of the Foreign Investment Review Act, from 1974 to 1985, detailed

34

data were published for individual firm applications to invest in Canada. These appeared in the
annual reports of the review agency, the last of which was Canada (1985).
A collection of the available data on production at home and abroad by home country
multinational firms and of production in many host countries by foreign-owned firms was
assembled in Lipsey, Ramstetter, and Blomström (1998). Detailed source notes appeared in
Lipsey, Blomström, and Ramstetter, (1995). Among the host countries covered in Asia were
China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand, and in Latin
America, Brazil, Mexico, and Uruguay. Developed host countries covered were Australia,
Canada, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A broader collection of
indicators of multinational activity other than production is provided in United Nations (2001).
There have been several extensive surveys of the literature and research on multinational
firms and FDI, fairly comprehensive at the time they were written. Two of the most extensive in
coverage are Caves (1996) and Dunning (1992).
