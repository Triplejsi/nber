Retirement Consumption: Insights from a Survey
John Ameriks, Andrew Caplin and John Leahy
NBER Working Paper No. 8735
January 2002
JEL No. E2, D1

ABSTRACT
Prior research has established that consumption falls significantly at retirement. What is not
known is the extent to which this fall is anticipated during the working years. Do working households
expect such a large fall in consumption upon retirement, or are they taken by surprise? Using data from
a new survey, we show that many working households do expect a considerable fall in consumption when
they retire. In fact, those who are already retired report significantly smaller falls in consumption than are
expected by those who are still working. We show that participation in the stock market plays a dominant
role in explaining the gap between expectations and outcomes, indicating that much of the gap is a result
of unexpected stock market appreciation. The survey produces new insights into the high level of
uncertainty in the period leading up to retirement, and the surprises that may lie in store when households
actually retire.

Introduction

The facts are not in dispute. Many households consume a great deal less after retirement
than they did before (Hamermesh [1984], Mariger [1987]). Yet the interpretation is hotly
disputed. Is this finding consistent with standard theories of saving? Banks, Blundell,
and Tanner [1998] and Bernheim, Skinner, and Weinberg [1997] argue that it reflects
a significant failure of forward-looking behavior: “many retirees. . . take stock of their
finances only to discover that their resources are insufficient to maintain their accustomed
standard of living.” In contrast, proponents of the classical life cycle model argue that
retirement is merely a relatively inexpensive life phase, and that there is no failure of
foresight.
Understanding retirement consumption is critical in tracking the twin processes of
wealth creation and capital accumulation. It is also vital to the current debate on the
adequacy of the U.S. savings rate. Yet research is hampered by the difficulty of measuring
expectations. It is relatively easy to confirm that actual consumption falls in retirement,
yet far harder to show that the drop in consumption is a deviation from prior expectations. The standard way to pin down expectations is to use data on actual consumption,
together with strong identifying assumptions. The critical identifying assumption in
Banks, et. al [1998] is that expected expenditure patterns among retirees are similar to
actual patterns observed among workers who have been laid off. The key assumptions in
Bernheim et. al [1997] concern which broad categories of realized expenditure are most
strongly work-related. Unfortunately, it is difficult to test the validity of these identifying
assumptions.
Given the ambiguity in the behavioral data, direct survey data on expectations may be
of value. The systematic use of survey measures of expected consumption was proposed
long ago by Juster [1966] in connection with demand for indivisible commodities. Yet
there has been very little macroeconomic use of this form of expectational data.1 Our
own research on this subject represents a much-belated effort to adapt Juster’s ideas to
the topic of aggregate consumption. We use data on expected and realized consumption
at retirement from two recent surveys of some 2,000 TIAA-CREF participants. These
data allow us to derive new insights on the determinants of retirement consumption. In
addition, they open up some new questions concerning households’ financial preparedness

Barsky, Juster, Kimball, and Shapiro [1997] present a pioneering application of survey techniques to
another important set of macroeconomic questions involving wealth accumulation.

for retirement.
We introduce the survey and the sample in section 2 of the paper. Section 3 presents
our specific questions concerning the change in consumption at retirement. In section 4
we use our data to analyze the expected change in consumption at retirement among
working households. We confirm that retirement is indeed seen as a relatively inexpensive
life phase, as stressed by proponents of the life cycle model. In our sample, the typical
household reports an expected fall in the order of 10%. For a household with a pattern
of education, income, and wealth more in line with the general population, our results
suggest an expected fall in the 20% range.
In section 5 we analyze how outcomes compare with these expectations. According
to the wealth shock hypothesis, one might expect actual consumption to fall below prior
expectations as retirees come face-to-face with their disappointing prospects. We find the
opposite. Rather than having lower than expected consumption due to negative wealth
shocks, many retired households appear to be consuming more than they had expected.
For the retired households in our sample, the reported drop in consumption at retirement
is significantly smaller than the expected drop, at around 2%.
In section 6 we explore the extent to which the high levels of retirement consumption
are the result of stock market appreciation. The huge increase in equity values during
the 1990s is an obvious candidate for a wealth shock that might have raised consumption
among retired stock holders. By combining our expectational data with measures of
stock ownership, we are able to confirm that most of the gap between expectation and
outcome can indeed be accounted for in this way. The finding of a large effect of portfolio
shares on reported consumption sheds light on another important macroeconomic issue:
the marginal propensity to consume out of increases in equity values.
While retirement does not produce a negative wealth shock, our survey suggests that
households may nevertheless be poorly prepared for retirement in other respects. We
show in section 7 that many households enter retirement profoundly uncertain about how
their change in work status will impact their consumption needs. When this uncertainty
is resolved, we find that more households are surprised by how high are expenditure needs
in retirement rather than by how low they are.
Does the systematic underestimation of retirement needs reflect an unpredictable
shock (say unpredictably high health expenditures), or does it represent a bias in expectations? We find some intriguing evidence supporting the bias theory. In comparison with
those whose survey responses indicated that they had done little retirement planning,
2

those who reported that they had spent a great deal of time planning were less biased
toward underestimation of needs. This last result points out how important it will be to
analyze the impact of planning activities on retirement preparation, as in Lusardi [1999]
and Ameriks, Caplin, and Leahy [2002].

2.1

The Sample and the Survey
The SPF and the FAB

The data used in this paper are drawn primarily from two surveys sent to a sample
of TIAA-CREF participants: the Survey of Participant Finances (SPF) conducted in
January 2000, and the Survey of Financial Attitudes and Behavior (FAB) conducted in
January 2001. The SPF was designed to examine in detail the type and the amount
of financial assets owned by a sample of TIAA-CREF participants. The FAB explored
these participants’ financial preferences, expectations, and attitudes.
The sample for both surveys are members of the “TIAA-CREF Research Panel.” In
1993, 60,000 TIAA-CREF participants were randomly selected as prospective members
of this panel. They were mailed a letter requesting their participation in research-related
surveys along with an initial survey containing questions regarding demographic and
other characteristics. A total of 9,847 responses were received. Respondents were sent
additional surveys in 1995, 1997, 1998, and 1999 prior to the SPF (2000) and the FAB
(2001). At the end of each survey, the Research Panel was defined as the set of households who had responded to at least one prior survey, and who were still TIAA-CREF
participants. The number of households in this panel changed over time according to the
survey response rates and the rate of attrition among TIAA-CREF participants. Since
response rates were in the 12%-21% range, the sample had to be replenished several times
in order to maintain a universe of adequate size.
At the end of 1999, the Research Panel comprised some 9,234 households. The SPF
was mailed to this group in January 2000. In total, 2,835 households responded to that
survey, for an overall response rate of 30.7%. The universe for the FAB comprised 2,687
of the 2,835 households who had responded to the SPF; the difference being accounted
for by changes of address, death, requests to be removed from the panel, etc. A response
rate on the order of 30% or less would have been very damaging to our project, and
considerable thought was given to issues of survey design in order to maximize response.
3

In particular, we followed procedures suggested by Dillman [1978] to boost the response
rate. The end result was a remarkably high response rate. Fully 2,064 of the 2,687
households responded to the survey (76.8%).

2.2

The Sample: Demographic and Financial Characteristics

In order to compare retirement expectations with retirement outcomes, we divide our
sample into two groups based on labor force participation. To preserve a clear distinction
between retired and nonretired households in multi-person households, we define the
household to be working only if no adult member is retired, and to be retired only if
all adults are retired. Of the 2,064 respondents who filled out the FAB, 1,074 were in
working households, while 735 were in retired households. The remaining 255 respondents
were either in partially retired households, or provided insufficient data to be clearly
categorized, and were therefore left out of the analysis.
Table 1 shows the basic demographic characteristics of sample households. We tabulate answers to questions on the respondent’s: gender; marital status (married, never
married, previously married); number of dependent children; and age. In addition to age,
we tabulate the expected number of years to retirement, which is derived as the difference
between the current age, and the best estimate to a question concerning the expected
age at retirement. We also tabulate educational and occupational characteristics. The
“other” employment category corresponds to secretarial, maintenance, and other support
positions.
It is clear that our sample is extremely well-educated. Unlike those with Ph.D’s,
the group with high school education alone is not large enough to warrant a separate
category: the lowest level of education we tabulate is college or below. In terms of
employment, more than 1 in 3 are teaching faculty, while the majority of the others
have management or professional positions. The gender, marital status, educational, and
occupational characteristics of the retired households in our sample are very similar to
those of the working households.

Table 2 presents additional qualitative data on our sample, including information
on home ownership, retiree health and long-term care insurance coverage, and defined
benefit pension plan coverage. The table shows that a very high proportion of the sample
own their homes rather than rent them. The majority of working owners have positive
balances remaining on their mortgages, while the majority of retired owners have no
remaining mortgage. With respect to health care, roughly 50% of households have at
5

least one member of the household with employer-provided health insurance extending
into retirement, but very few have coverage for long term care. About a quarter of the
respondents in working households, and a third of those in retired households, indicated
that they participate in a defined benefit pension plan (of course, this pension plan is in
addition to any TIAA-CREF and/or other defined contribution pension plans).

Table 3 summarizes households’ economic characteristics. Data on earnings is from
questions on the FAB in which we asked households to provide estimates of their overall
taxable income from employment in 1999. Most of the asset and debt information is
drawn from the SPF. We record not only the total level of wealth, but also the division
between retirement assets and non-retirement assets. Within the non-retirement assets,
we separate out real estate wealth, which includes both owner-occupied and investment
assets. With regard to debt, we distinguish between mortgage debt, and all other forms
of debt, including credit card and educational debts. Note that Table 3 uses all of the
data available on an item-by-item basis, so that sample sizes differ across rows of the
table. Complete wealth data (i.e., a complete response to each and every question on the
survey) was provided by only 55% of those who are working, and 40% of those who are
retired.

Notes: Earnings is the reported level of household taxable income from employment in the
calendar year 1999. “Total financial assets” is the sum of all retirement account balances,
mutual funds (except real estate mutual funds), directly held stocks, directly held bonds,
checking accounts, savings accounts, and CDs. “Total assets” is total financial assets
plus the value of homes and other real estate. “Total net worth” is total assets minus
mortgage debt, outstanding educational loans, outstanding personal loans, and credit
card balances. All aggregates exclude the value of real estate mutual funds, whole life
insurance policies, trusts, and educational savings accounts (Education IRAs and 529
plans). All wealth data are as of December 31, 1999.

In Table 3 we use net worth as our overall summary statistic for the household’s
balance sheet situation. As one would expect, retired households have generally accumulated more wealth than working households. Going beyond this, the most striking
features of the wealth data are the generally high means and the relatively low variability. We discuss these features in more detail when we compare our sample with a
representative sample in the next section.
7

With respect to earnings, the table shows that mean household income from employment among working households is $87,000, while the median is $73,000. However given
that our fundamental interest is in the lifetime budget set, we are more interested in
the present value of future household income from employment rather than income in
any given year. Fortunately, our sample contains many data items of potential value
in computing this present value. We have estimates of the remaining years before the
respondent retires. In addition, we asked households not only for their actual household
income from employment in the years 1998, 1999, and 2000, but also for their estimated
future incomes in 2001, 2005, and 2010. Our procedure for using these data to arrive at a
final estimate of the present value of future employment income is detailed in Appendix 1.

2.3

A Comparison with the SCF

In what ways does our sample differ from a random sample of U.S. households? Table 4
records financial characteristics of households in the Survey of Consumer Finances, which
is a representative sample of U.S. households.
Our sample clearly possesses far greater wealth than the representative group of households in the in the SCF. Net worth among both our working and retired households is
some 2.5-3 times higher than in the SCF. In addition, there appears to be far greater
homogeneity in our sample than in the SCF. As one reflection of this, median net worth
in our sample is some 5-6 times as high in the SCF. A particularly striking difference
between our sample and the SCF concerns the distribution of financial assets. In our
sample, mean financial assets are $587,000, with a median of $273,000. In the SCF, the
mean is smaller by a factor of 5 at $124,000, while the median is smaller by a factor of
18, at $15,000.
In addition to differences in net worth, there are important differences in composition.
Average debt levels are generally lower in our sample than in the SCF. The difference is
accounted for by the fact that there are a significant number of households in the SCF
with very high levels of personal debt, while in our sample the level of personal debt is
almost universally low.
The fact that our sample of working households have generally high levels of nonretirement financial assets and low debt levels implies that very few are liquidity constrained in the sense of being “hand-to-mouth” consumers. In standard treatments,
households with levels of non-retirement financial assets below $10,000 are treated as
8

liquidity constrained. If we use this criterion, well under 10% of our sample are liquidity
constrained.

Spending in Retirement: The Question

3.1

The Questions

Questions 16a and 16b were the fundamental questions on retirement consumption:
• 16a: For many households, overall spending changes dramatically upon retirement.
Please indicate below (what) your experience has been (if you are retired), or what
your expectations are (if not retired)
9

– My household had (or expects to have) no change in spending at retirement
– My household has spent (or will spend) more after retirement than before
(also answer 16b)
– My household has spent (or will spend) less after retirement than before (also
answer 16b).
• 16b: About how much more or less (as a percentage of your annual pre-retirement
spending)?
We asked for three distinct estimates in response to 16b: a low estimate, a closest
estimate, and a high estimate. The precise meaning of these three estimates was clarified
earlier in the survey:
• Because of the uncertainty that is inherent in any question about your financial
future, the following questions ask you to provide three estimates:
– a LOW estimate, where you are 90% sure that the correct answer is above
this number
– your CLOSEST estimate of the most accurate answer
– a HIGH estimate, where you are 90% sure the correct answer is below this
number.
There are two entirely different approaches one can take when posing questions on
the level of consumption. Our approach was to ask the question in a manner that
accords with the “common-sense” notion of consumption as directly tied to expenditures.
The obvious alternative involves making a strong effort to convey to the respondent the
precise economic meaning of consumption expenditures, so that they make appropriate
adjustments. It was our belief that the former approach would be easier for households to
understand, especially given our request for low, closest, and high quantitative estimates
of the change at retirement. This may have contributed to the high response rates.
Questions 16a and 16b were answered by the vast majority of respondents. 90% of the
sample answered question 16a, and of those who were eligible, 90% answered the closest
estimate part of question 16b. Even the high and low estimates were provided by almost
70% of those eligible to answer.
10

The potential drawback of our common-sense approach is that it exposes us to potential ambiguity. One important question is whether or not respondents include debt
repayments (especially mortgage payments) as part of their overall spending. Fortunately, we have a great deal of data on households’ levels of debt which we can use to
assess the quantitative importance of this ambiguity in determining the answers to our
questions. As we will see in the next section, the results are surprisingly clean. It appears that many households correctly interpreted question 16a as referring to changes in
expenses associated with the event of retirement itself, discounting any change in debt
payments as irrelevant. More generally, we find that the impact of potential ambiguities
on the quantitative answers to question 16 to be rather low.

Imputations and Corrections

The quantitative answers to question 16b require interpretation. One issue is imputation:
what numerical value should be filled in for those who report no expected change in
consumption at retirement, and for those who report an expected change but do not
fill in a numerical value? A second issue is the relatively large number of households
who report expected falls in consumption of either 80% or 90%. Not only do such huge
falls in consumption seem a priori unlikely, but there were very few households in the
51%-69% range, suggesting even more strongly that there is something artificial in the
second mode of the distribution.
Through the body of the paper we use simple and natural procedures to adjust the
data. For those who report no expected change in consumption at retirement, we impute
the numerical answer of a zero expected change. For those who report an expected
increase but provide no numerical estimate, we use the conditional average among those
giving the same qualitative answer. Finally, we assume that all households who fill in
an expected fall in consumption of more than 50% misread the question, filling in the
more familiar “replacement rate” (the ratio of retirement consumption to pre-retirement
consumption) rather than answering the question about the change per se.
In Appendix 2 we detail a more intricate procedure for going from the survey answers
to the underlying distribution of answers to question 16b. This approach involves using
a maximum likelihood procedure based on the assumption of lognormality to correct
for all reporting errors, including a possible bias associated with the rounding process.
Given our identifying assumptions, we can then estimate the distribution of the “correct”
11

answers to the survey. Fortunately, there is very little quantitative difference between the
simple procedures used in the paper and the more intricate procedure described in the
Appendix. In particular the complete maximum likelihood procedure strongly suggests
that all of the data lying at 50 and above are the result of reporting error.

3.3

What Window around Retirement?

The retirement expectations of very young households may be driven by entirely different forces than those of older households. In fact, our data suggest that younger
households expect significantly smaller falls in consumption at retirement than do the
remaining households. One possible explanation may be that younger households are
naive (in the sense of O’Donoghue and Rabin [1999]) about their ability to save for their
old age. A second possible explanation involves liquidity constraints. When these are
currently binding, households may look forward to retirement as a time of relatively high
consumption in which these constraints have been removed. Whatever the explanation,
it is not clear that the expectations of very young households should have any weight in
our analysis.
Just as we need to take care in our specification of the working sample, so we need to
be aware that households who live for unusually long periods following retirement may
answer question 16 in a qualitatively different manner than do recent retirees. Again, it is
not clear that the answers of the super-aged are relevant, since our fundamental interest
concerns a change associated with the event of retirement itself, rather than the aging
process per se. To limit the impact of youth and old age in distorting our results, we set a
20 year pre-retirement window and a 10 year post-retirement window for inclusion in the
regression samples. In addition we exclude from the retired sample those who have been
retired for less than one year, on the grounds that they may have insufficient experience
of the retired style of life to have adequately adjusted expectations.

Expectations of Working Households
Basic Data

Table 5 presents simple summary statistics of the answers to questions 16a and the
“best estimate” part of question 16b among working households. We present data both
for the entire working population, and for the “regression sample” that satisfies the
12

two conditions (no more than 20 years to retirement and adequate data) required to
be included in the regression analysis. In these tabulations, and throughout the rest
of the paper, we have converted the reported percentages into corresponding implied
changes in the natural logarithm of consumption (this produces a symmetric treatment
of consumption increases and decreases, and is more consistent with measures used in
other studies).

Note: Respondents were asked to provided data on the expected percentage
change in spending at retirement; we have converted these responses to implied
changes in the natural logarithm of consumption.

It is clear that the majority of households expect consumption in retirement to fall.
In the regression sample, more than 55% expect a fall in consumption, while less than 8%
expect an increase. A second striking fact is that among those who expect consumption
to fall, the average expected fall is in the order of 25%. More generally there appears to
be massive individual heterogeneity. Even though only 8% of sample households expect
an increase in consumption at retirement, the mean among these is an expected increase
of close to 20%.

4.2

Regression Results

Many economic and demographic forces may influence the expected level of retirement
in consumption. Table 6 summarizes our basic regression results for the level of expected
retirement consumption among sample households. The dependent variable in this regression is the expected change in consumption (expressed as a natural logarithm). The
13

right hand side variables include demographic dummies based on the respondent’s gender
and marital status, as well as other variables tracking the number of dependent children,
and the respondent’s age. We include also indicators of education and occupation, as well
as home ownership and health insurance status. The financial variables included are net
worth, the present value of future income from employment, and indicators concerning
defined benefit pension coverage.

Notes: The dependent variable is our measure of expected change in the log
of consumption, as described in the text. There were 331 observations used
in this regression. The R2 was 0.1078, and F (16, 314) was 2.37.

The most striking finding is the strongly significant positive coefficient on net worth.
The coefficient suggests that a doubling of net worth (an increase of one log point) is
associated with a 5-6% increase in expected consumption at retirement. The importance
of net worth is especially striking given the apparent irrelevance of future income from
employment. How can these two variables, which should have similar impacts in terms
of shifting the lifetime budget set, have such different implications for retirement consumption? The most natural explanation would seem to be based on differences in the
14

desire to save for retirement. If households differ in their preference for consumption in
retirement relative to consumption in the working years, then those who desire a higher
relative level of retirement consumption will be accumulating more wealth in order to pay
for it. But unless this taste parameter is correlated with the overall net present value of
future earnings, there is no reason to expect a relationship between the value of human
capital and expected retirement consumption.
Aside from wealth, there are no other variables that are significant at the 5% level.
Lack of continuing employer-sponsored health insurance, lack of long term care insurance,
and ownership of a defined benefit pension might all be expected to raise expected spending in retirement, yet these effects are apparently not statistically significant. The lack
of impact of home ownership on expected retirement consumption is also striking, since
our question may have been interpreted differently by home owners than by renters. To
a first approximation, for a renter whose expenditure includes payments for housing services, the answer should represent the change in total consumption, housing included. In
contrast owners’ answers should measure the expected change in non-housing consumption, since there is no payment that corresponds to the implicit flow of consumption
derived from the house. Apparently the expected fall in consumption at retirement is
very similar, regardless of the definition used.

4.3

Is Net Worth Enough?

Do all assets and debts enter equally into the determination of retirement consumption?
One obvious question concerns whether assets and debts should be netted out, or instead
treated as having potentially different impacts on retirement expectations. A second
question is whether or not retirement and non-retirement assets should be treated symmetrically. A third is whether residential real estate represents an entirely separate asset
category due to its illiquidity. Finally, on the debt side of the balance sheet, it is natural to wonder whether or not mortgage debt has the same relationship with expected
retirement consumption as do other forms of personal debt, such as credit card debt.
To check whether or not our data suggest a separate role for any of these decompositions of net worth, we have run a series of regressions in which we include measures
of the share of net worth comprised of each subcategory of financial instrument (shares
were constructed for retirement assets, real estate assets, mortgage debt and personal
debt). We estimated specifications including each subcategory by itself (in addition to
15

the other variables listed in Table 6), and in combination with all the others. We found
that none of the subcategories had statistical significance at the 10% level or less, either
singly or jointly. Apparently the information contained in the net worth figure conveys
all that is needed to understand the level of expected retirement consumption.
The apparent independence of expected retirement consumption from the composition
of net worth is striking. In part, it may be related to special characteristics of the
households in our sample. For example the irrelevance of the retirement asset share
may be connected to the relatively small number of households in the sample for whom
liquidity constraints are binding. In similar manner, the irrelevance of the composition
of debts may be a result of our sample households having relatively low levels of credit
card debt, which may in turn be associated with their having relatively high levels of
self control. The irrelevance of the share in real estate assets may be related to financial
sophistication: it suggests that many households in the sample view their homes at least
in part as assets that are potentially available for consumption in retirement. Finally,
the irrelevance of aggregate debt levels is suggestive of an entirely different form of
sophistication: it suggests that most respondents intepreted question 16a just as we
had intended, treating as irrelevant changes in debt service payments not specifically
related to retirement.

4.4

Expectations at Retirement

We are particularly interested in using our regression analysis to characterize the expected
level of retirement consumption for a household on the verge of retirement. We consider
a married couple with no dependent children, with a male respondent of age 65 who is a
non-faculty member with a masters of professional degree. The household owns their own
home, has no employer-provided health insurance in retirement, no defined benefit plan,
and no long term care insurance. Since the household is at the point of retirement, they
have zero future income from employment. In figure 1 we plot the expected change in
consumption at retirement implied by our regression as a function of the level of wealth
at retirement.

One point to note is that this expectation is somewhat lower than the raw numbers
describing our sample average. The raw data produce an average expected fall in the order
of 10%, yet figure 1 indicates that a typical household on the verge or retirement with
net worth of $500,000 expects a fall of some 15%. The two primary factors accounting
for the expectation of an additional 5% fall in consumption are that figure 1 is drawn for
a non-faculty member who is considerably older than average working household (there
is a small negative coefficient on age).
Figure 1 goes some way to reconciling our finding with the earlier literature in which
the fall in retirement consumption has been far larger than in our sample. At a net worth
of $200,000, figure 1 suggests that the expected fall in retirement consumption would be
in the order of 20%, which is close to the numbers in the prior literature.

The main finding is immediately obvious: recently retired households have generally
had smaller falls in consumption than is anticipated by those who are still working. While
more than 55% of working households in our sample expect consumption to fall, only
30% of the retired reported that they had experienced such a fall. On the other side of
this, while less than 8% of working households in our sample expect consumption to rise,
more than 20% of the retired households experienced such a rise.

Regression Analysis

Table 8 summarizes our basic regression results for the determinants of actual retirement
consumption for our sample of retired households. The regression is identical to that for
working households in section 4.2 above, with the exception that we exclude income from
employment, the number of dependent children, and home ownership, since they show
insufficient variation. As with the working sample, net worth is the only variable that is
significant at the 5% level. No other variables are significant even at the 10% level.

5.3

The Gap

Comparing regression results it seems clear that recent retirees experience a smaller fall
in consumption than expected by working households who are close to retirement. To
provide simple statistical confirmation, we run a pooled regression in which we add a
dummy for whether or not the household is retired, and allow the coefficient on wealth
to depend on whether or not the household is retired. We exclude household income, the
number of children, and homeownership status from this regression, since they are absent
from the regression for retired households, and irrelevant to the regression for working
households. Table 9 summarizes regression results.

children, with a male respondent of age 65 who is a non-faculty member with a masters
of professional degree, and with no employer-provided health insurance in retirement, no
defined benefit plan, and no long term care insurance. As the curve shows, at a net worth
level of $500,000, the expected level of retirement consumption falls a full 10% below the
realized level for this same household.

Wealth Shocks
Equity Shares

The potential for increases in equity values during the 1990’s to explain the high level
of consumption in our retired sample is highlighted by the fact that equity shares are
so large. Our data on household portfolio shares comes from two primary sources. In
addition to the SPF, we have gone directly to TIAA-CREF data to extract a precise
value for the TIAA-CREF holdings of all respondents as of the survey date of this wealth
survey. We replace the survey data with this precise measure in arriving at our estimate
of the proportion of equities in the household’s entire portfolio of financial assets. Table
10 characterizes these equity holdings for the retired and the working households in the
regression samples.

Equity holdings are high in our sample in comparison to the population as a whole;
more than two thirds of both our working and retired samples have at least 25% of their
household’s net worth invested in stocks. Very few working households have no equity;
however, 19.1% of the retired respondents indicate that less than 10% of their net worth
is held in the form of stocks. The median working household has around 40% of financial
wealth in equity, while the median retired household has somewhat less.

6.2

Adding Equities

We use a simple regression to confirm that equities appear to play a large part in explaining the high realized level of retirement consumption. Table 11 summarizes results
of a pooled regression in which we add the equity shares as a fraction of net worth to
our pooled regression of the last section. Given our existing findings concerning the irrelevance of the composition of net worth for working households, we expect a similar
irrelevance to hold for the share of equities. However we also add a dummy to capture
the possible increased impact of equities in retirement. Here we expect an asymmetry. A
household with a high share of equities would likely have been impacted by a far larger
wealth shock than would a household with relatively low equity levels. Hence we expect
a positive coefficient on the equity share in retirement.

Notes: The dependent variable is our measure of the expected (for working

The R2 was 0.1645, and F (17, 407) was 4.71. A test of the joint significance of the retired dummy and the net worth/retired interaction variable has
an F(2,407) of 0.09.

As hypothesized, we find that the equity effect is entirely irrelevant for working households, yet has a significant positive impact on actual consumption among retired households. Once the equity effect is removed, there appears to be no significant impact of
retirement on the level of consumption. In fact the test for the joint significance of the
retirement dummy and the retirement wealth coefficient has an F-statistic of 0.09.

6.3

Equities and the Gap

Figure 3 indicates that equity effects play a very large role in explaining the gap between
expectations and outcomes. The figure shows our standard 65 year-old household of the
last section where we condition not only on wealth, but also on the share of wealth in
equity. The particular comparison drawn is for a household with no equities. As the
23

figure shows, a household with $500,000 in wealth but no equity expects consumption to
fall some 18% in retirement, while the realized outcome is closer to 16%, an insignificant
difference.

The above findings suggest that households’ expectations of retirement consumption are
not systematically in error. Yet it would be a mistake to conclude that households
were therefore entirely well-prepared for their retirements. In this section we consider
two separate indications of lack of preparedness. We begin by analyzing the subjective
uncertainty of households in the pre-retirement period, showing the large amount of
uncertainty with which retirement is approached. We follow up by exploring the ex
post impressions of retired households concerning the types of cost surprises that they
encountered in retirement, and show that the nature of this surprise is influenced by
planning behavior.

7.1

Subjective Uncertainty

Question 16b was designed to shed light not only on expected consumption at retirement,
but also on the degree of subjective uncertainty. Table 12 produces basic facts about the
range of uncertainty, which we define as the absolute difference between the answers to
24

the high and low estimates in response to question 16b. In terms of the subjective prior,
the range of uncertainty is defined as the central eight deciles of the distribution. In
addition to producing unconditional averages, table 12 characterizes the impact of years
to retirement on the range of uncertainty.

The range of uncertainty is very large, amounting to over 25% of pre-retirement
consumption. It is also striking that the number of years to retirement has no systematic
impact on the range of uncertainty. One might have expected less uncertainty for those
who are closer to retirement, due both to reduced wealth uncertainty and to a possibly
increased understanding of what is in store for them in retirement.
One other factor that one might expect to impact the range of uncertainty is the
wealth portfolio, with less uncertainty for those who hold less risky portfolios. A simple
regression of the range of uncertainty on portfolio shares for those close to retirement
reveals that there is indeed such a relationship. However, the best estimate of the residual
uncertainty for a household with no risky assets remains well above 20%.
High as they are, there is reason to believe that the numbers provided above may
understate the true level of uncertainty. The question as posed suggests that all three
answers (high, best, and low) should lie on the same side of zero. This makes it a very
hard question to answer for a household expecting a 10% fall, but believing that a 5%
or more rise has probability 1/10. The household might reasonably feel that the correct
answer is 0%. They may even interpret the question to be asking about the top decile
of their subjective distribution conditional on consumption falling, in which case they
25

should provide a strictly positive answer (“if our consumption at retirement falls, there
is a 90% chance that the fall will be larger than 3%”). In either case, the bias operates
to artificially shrink the stated range.

7.2

Surprise

One implication of high pre-retirement uncertainty is that precautionary savings may be
important not only in the early period of life when liquidity constraints are important,
but also later in life before retirement uncertainty is resolved. For present purposes, the
more crucial issue raised by the high level of prior uncertainty is the question of what
happens when the uncertainty is resolved. Question 17 was designed to focus directly on
the qualitative issue of whether or not there were expense surprises in retirement:
• 17a. If you are currently retired, how do your spending needs in retirement compare
with those you expected before you retired:
– About what you expected
– Higher than you expected
– Lower than you expected
Table 13 presents the basic data. The dominant feature is the large number who
report not having been surprised. The second feature is the apparent, if small, bias in
the direction of surprise. More households report being surprised by how high were their
expenses in retirement rather than by how low they were.

Planning and Surprise

Are mistakes in predicting retirement consumption due to some common shock (e.g. cost
shocks for health expenditures), or are they due to poor planning? We are in a good position to address this issue, since many questions on the survey were focused on the extent
of household planning activities. The most straightforward summary measure of planning
activity is a question that is entirely qualitative. We asked respondents to indicate which
of six statements (disagree strongly, disagree, disagree somewhat, agree somewhat, agree,
and agree strongly) best characterized their attitude toward the assertion in question:
• Question 1a: I have spent a great deal of time developing a financial plan.
Table 14 shows that self-reported planning activity has a strong and predictable
impact on the answer to question 17a.

The striking finding concerns the asymmetry. For those who have planned the most,
the asymmetry is entirely absent. For those at intermediate levels of planning, the
asymmetry matches its level in the broader population. For those who have done the
least planning, the asymmetry is significantly more marked than it is in the broader
population.
Does the relationship between planning and surprise survive in a multivariate context?
Table 15 summarizes results of an ordered probit analysis of the answers to question 17a
on planning activity (question 1a), insurance status, and demographic controls. The only
significant variable is planning activity, which is significant at the 3% level. Note that
the regression we report is for all retired households: if we restrict attention to those 1-10
years from retirement, the coefficient on planning increases slightly, but the reduction in
sample size reduces significance to the 7% level.

Notes: The dependent variable is an ordered measure of the direction of the
“spending surprise” reported by the individual (higher than expected, as expected, lower than expected). There were 604 observations in the regression,
the Likelihood Ratio (χ2 (13)) for the regression was 9.49; with a p-value of
0.735.

Why is low planning associated with a systematic underestimation of spending needs
in retirement? The most intriguing possibility connects planning with a less downwardbiased estimate view of retirement consumption. It may be easier to recognize which of
one’s current expenses will be less pressing than it is to visualize entirely new categories
of expense associated with the retired life style. Do planning activities help to reduce this
asymmetry, and force households to recognize that some expenses will actually increase?
Clearly, this is an area in which more research is needed.

Concluding Remarks

We present some new insights on retirement consumption that are derived from survey
data on some 2,000 TIAA-CREF participants. We show that retirement is seen as a
relatively inexpensive life phase, as stressed by proponents of the life cycle model. We
further find that many retired households appear to be consuming more than they had
expected. We confirm that almost all of the gap between expectation and outcome can
be accounted for by stock market appreciation.
28

Even though retirement does not produce a negative wealth shock, our survey suggests
that households in the survey may be poorly prepared for retirement in other respects.
Many households enter retirement profoundly uncertain about how their change in work
status will impact their consumption needs. When this uncertainty is resolved, we find
that more households are surprised by how high are expenditure needs in retirement
rather than by how low they are. We find suggestive evidence that the systematic underestimation of retirement may reflect a bias in expectations.
While our sample is far from representative, it is our hope that the main methodological lessons, as well as several of the substantive findings, will apply more generally.
In particular, our results suggest that survey measures of expected consumption may be
of great value in macroeconomic research.

Appendix 1
Our goal is to estimate the present value of all remaining household income from employment from year 2000 on until retirement. We proceed as follows. For each household, we
first compute how many years there are remaining until the expected date of retirement.
This defines the number of years of (non-zero) employment income that we are going
to estimate for that household. Some of this data is derived directly from the survey.
For each of the future years for which data was requested (2001, 2005, and 2010), we
enter the household’s best estimate (if supplied) as a point estimate of the expectation of
income for the year in question. We then fill in all of the intermediate years using simple
interpolation assuming a constant rate of (geometric) growth in unreported years.
At the end of the interpolation stage, all households have data for some set of contiguous years. We then develop a fairly standard growth regression to predict the increase in
income in a given year as a function of the prior year’s growth in income, the prior year’s
level of income, age, age squared, age cubed, occupation, level of education, and gender.
The regression is fitted to our interpolated income data for 2001-2010, as well as actual
income data for 1998-2000, where available. The regression is summarized in table A1.

Notes: The dependent variable is the change in income from period t − 1
to t (which would be denoted ∆ ln Y (t)). There were 7,577 observations of
1,019 individuals; the standard errors reported above have been corrected
for clustering based on individuals. The R2 of the regression was 0.054; and
the regression has an F (11, 1018) of 11.76.

To illustrate the implications of this regression, Figure A1 shows the age-earnings
profile that would be obtained for a male, Ph.D. faculty member, age 40 in 2000, whose
income in 1998 was $75,000, and whose income growth in 1999 was 0.03 log points over
1998.

We use our earnings growth equation to extend all income data to the final retirement
date. With this we have estimates of complete income profiles for all sample households
from 2000 until retirement. All that remains is to pick an appropriate rate of interest to
discount the stream to the present. We use the simple assumption of a constant interest
rate of 3% per annum in the measure of employment income in the paper. We have
performed some sensitivity analyses in which this interest rate is allowed to vary from
2% p.a to 7% p.a. None of the regressions in the paper are significantly impacted by
these changes in the discount rate.

Appendix 2
To estimate the underlying distribution of responses to question 16b, we begin by noting
that the propensity to answer question 16b varies with the response to question 16a. All of
those who answered that they expected no change were automatically assigned an answer
of zero to the “best estimate” part of question 16b, while only 90% of those expecting a
change answered this question. To neutralize these response rate differentials, we assume
that conditional on their state (retired/non-retired) and their answer to question 16a, the
non-respondents are distributed in the same manner as the respondents. This amounts
to reweighting the answers to question 16b by the inverse of the conditional response
rate.

Figures A2 and A3 show the reweighted distributions of answers to question 16b
for non-retirees and retirees respectively. Two features stand out. First, answers are
generally rounded. Most of those who gave positive or negative values gave answers that
are rounded to the nearest five, but some may have rounded to the nearest ten. More
importantly, there appears to be a fairly generous interpretation of “no change”. The
spike at zero is quite large and seems to draw mass from a fairly wide range about the
origin. In the case of the non-retirees, respondents are more likely to answer ±20 than
±5, ±10, or ±15. Second, there is a hump in the distribution below -50% centered at
-80%. These declines are implausibly large. It appears that these agents provided the
replacement ratio rather than the percent change in consumption.
We estimate the underlying distribution of responses by maximum likelihood, allowing
for the behavior noted in the previous paragraph. If x is the underlying change in
consumption, we assume that x + 100 is log-normally distributed. We allow the mean
and the variance of this distribution to depend on whether or not the respondent is retired.
2
Let µN and σN
denote the mean and variance of the non-retired and µR and σR2 the mean
and variance of the retired. To handle the rounding to the nearest 5, we round all x’s
to the nearest 5. Leaving the unrounded numbers has very little effect on the estimated
coefficients. To handle the rounding to zero, we assume that respondent’s with x ∈
[−15, 15] round to zero with probability 1−p(x). We restrict p to be symmetric about zero
and to be the same for both retired and non-retired. To handle the observations below
32

-50, we assume that conditional on reporting that consumption will fall, respondents
give the correct x with probability q and mistakenly report 1 − x with probability 1 − q.
The probability q is assumed to be the same for both retired and non-retired and to be
independent of x < 0.
The results of the estimation are as follows

When we use this distribution to create a simulated sample, the result is generally very
close to our actual sample. In particular, the simulated sample fits the hump below -50%
very well. This confirms that almost all observations below -50% are due to reporting
error. One place that the simulation does not fit so well is that it underestimates the
number of actual respondents expecting a 50% fall in consumption. Presumably this
reflects a second focal point that could be better captured in a yet more intricate model
of rounding error.
