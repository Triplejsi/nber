The Effects of Website Provision on the Demand for German Women’s Magazines
Ulrich Kaiser
NBER Working Paper No. 8806
February 2002
JEL No. C3, L1

ABSTRACT
The effect of website provision on the demand for German women’s magazines is analyzed using
differentiated product demand models estimated on panel data that cover the period 1990–2000.
Descriptive evidence on the magazines’ website contents suggests that websites are used to provide
supplementary information and to advertise the current print issue. Website provision does not
significantly affect magazines’ market shares. This result is robust with respect to the application of
alternative econometric approaches to identify the demand model. A counter-factual analysis shows,
however, that online magazines would loose around 0.3 per cent in market shares if they went back
offline. Likewise, magazines that are currently offline may gain market shares of between 0.07 and 0.37
per cent if they launched a website. Interestingly, some of the potential ‘winners’ from going online
actually launched a website in 2001.

Introduction

Launching a website is a costly venture. Even if a website already is online, it has
to be technically maintained, its contents have to be updated and every now and
then a relaunch is in order. At least potentially, additional indirect costs may
arise if magazines go online since one might fear that consumers substitute away
from the print media towards calling up information from the internet. Given
these facts and fears, two questions arise. The first is “why do magazines go
online?”, followed by “what happens to demand if a magazine goes online?”
This paper aims at answering these questions by looking at the German women’s
magazine market between 1990 and 2000 using publicly available panel data. The
first German women’s magazine went online in spring 1996. Two competing magazines followed the same year. By 2000, eight women’s magazines out of a total
of 41 magazines active in the market provide their own website. This indicates
that there are in fact incentives to invest in a website.
In this study, the German women’s magazine market and women’s magazine websites are descriptively analyzed. Demand effects of website launching are studied
using econonometric panel data techniques within a differentiated product demand framework.
An analysis of the characteristics of purchasers of women’s magazine shows that
consumers purchasing a magazine that went online are more likely to have internet access. Purchasers of magazines that provide a website also use the internet
more often at work and at home than purchasers of magazines that are offline.
These descriptive results suggest that the decision to launch a website is likely
to be to a large extent driven by the readership of the magazine.
An analysis of the ten existing women’s magazine websites shows that the content of the websites is complementary to the information provided by the printed
magazine. Article downloads are not provided by the magazine websites. Instead,
visitors call up a variety of information coming under headings such as ‘Beauty
and fashion’, ‘Love and partnership’ and ‘Today’s horoscope’. Important other
ingredients of the websites are the table of contents of the most current printed
magazine edition, a subscription possibility and links to products of the affiliated
publishing group.
Due to the fact that the websites have quite different contents compared to the
printed magazines and tend to be used to advertise the current print edition, the
possibility to substitute away from the magazine is very limited. Instead, the
1

provision of an own website appears to serve as a quality characteristic of the
magazine and as a quality signal to consumers. Therefore, the analysis of the
effect of website provision on the demand for the print magazine uses a differentiated product demands framework, treating website provision as a magazine
quality characteristic.
An identification problem arises from the simultaneous determination of prices
and market shares in these demand models. This paper applies two different
approaches to identify the parameters of the demand model: (i) traditional
instrumental–variable techniques and (ii) estimation of panel data models with
autoregressive error terms. The main result of this paper is that website provision
does not have a significant effect on market shares. Like most other results, this
finding is robust to all of the econometric specifications being considered.
The quantitative effects of website provision are, however, quite sizeable in some
cases. A counter–factual analysis that estimates the demand effects of going back
offline (for magazines that run a website) and of launching a website (for magazines that are offline) shows that magazines that are online would loose around
0.3 per cent of market shares if it went back offline. Magazines that are offline
are estimated to gain between 0.07 and 0.37 per cent if they launch a website.
The gain in website launching is largest for magazines targeting women aged between 20 and 29. It is lowest for magazines focussing on women above 70 years of
age. The fact that two of the magazines that would belong to the winners from
going online actually launched a website in 2001 provides additional faith in the
estimation results.

2.1

Descriptive analysis
Why study the women’s magazine market?

There are at least two good arguments for analyzing the women’s magazine market: first, it is a large market and second, it is a market in which the actors face
fierce competition. These two facts are shown in Table 1. The table is based
on a publication entitled ‘Markt– und Medienentwicklung 1990–2001’ (Gruner
+ Jahr 2001), edited by one of the large German publishing houses. This data
source is described in greater detail in Section 3. Table 1 displays the number of titles, the market shares — measured in terms of copies sold — and the
2

Hirshman–Herfindahl index of market concentration for each segment of the German magazine market.1 TV magazines and women’s magazines own the largest
shares of the German magazine market, followed by TV supplements2 as well as
by car and motor cycle magazines. While TV and women’s magazines are almost
equal important in terms of market shares, they differ markedly with respect to
market concentration and the number of titles published. Market concentration
is by far the lowest and the number of published titles is by far the highest in
the women’s magazine market compared to any other segment in the industry,
further motivating the analysis of this particular market segment.
This subsection uses the broad definition of women’s magazines as applied by
the publishing industry (e.g. Gruner + Jahr 2001). The descriptive and econometric analysis ignores, however, magazines targeting at women aged below 19
years (‘Bravo Girl’, ‘Brigitte Young Miss’, ‘JOY’, ‘Mädchen’ and ‘YoYo’) and
magazines focussing very narrowly on needlework and handicraft issues (‘Burda
Mode+Magazin’, ‘Anna’, ‘Neue Mode’, ‘Strick +Schick’ and ‘Verena’) since these
two magazine groups operate in a distinctively different submarket than all other
magazines considered in this paper, an issue that has been brought to me by
industry people. The two magazine groups account for a joint share in the total
women’s magazine market of 3.9 per cent in 2000.

2.2

What types of magazines launch a website?

Two driving forces may basically be at work when a magazine decides upon
launching a website. First, the publishing house might have an interest to signal
to consumers and advertising clients that it is up–to–date and at the edge of the
technological development. It might also be interested in implementing a joint
internet platform for all its magazines to realize returns to scale. Second, consumers might demand to have the opportunity to call up additional information
on the internet.
Table 2 displays the names of the magazines that went online, their publishing houses, the total number of titles published by the publishing house, the

magazines, including the publishers names. With the exception of the small publishing houses Milchstrasse and Condé Nast, all other publishers also edit women’s
magazines that have not yet gone online. Even if magazines have the same publisher, such as ‘Elle’ and ‘Freundin’ (both Burda Media), their websites appear
to be quite dissimilar with respect to website organization and design, suggesting

that publishing houses do not aim at providing lookalike websites based on a joint
platform for their magazines. The decision to launch a website hence appears not
mainly be driven by the publishing house. Interestingly in this respect, the decision to relaunch a website also seems to be unrelated to publisher affiliation since
the three magazines that ever relaunched their website — Allegra, Brigitte and
Cosmopolitan (all relaunched in 2000) — belong to different publishing houses.
Indeed, the magazines that went online are much more similar with regard to
internet use of their readership than with respect to their publishers, as Table
3 suggests. Table 3 is based on data that was made available to me by Burda
Advertsing Center4 and compares the extent of internet use between magazines
that went online and magazines that did not provide a website in 2000. Table 3
shows, by displaying means and medians of the consumer internet use characteristics as well as by testing for significant difference in means (t–test with unequal
variances ) and medians (ranksum test), that purchasers of magazines that went
online use the internet more often than purchasers of magazines that are still
offline. The mean share of internet users of purchasers of magazines that are

online is 26.7 per cent which is to compare with a mean share of internet users
of 11.2 per cent for purchasers of magazines that are offline. These differences
also show up if it is further differentiated with respect to internet access/internet
use at home and/or at work. They also hold if internet use and internet access
is compared within magazine segments, e.g. within magazines groups that focus
on consumers of similar.

2.3

Key contents of the magazine’s websites

In contrast to many newspapers that basically put up the entire set of articles
contained in the current printed issue on the internet, the websites of the women’s
magazines do not provide information identical to those offered by the print media. They merely provide an additional and complementary resource of news and
recommendations.
A visit of the ten websites in early October 2001 and a revisit in early February
2002 indeed suggest that there is very little overlap between the printed magazine
and the website information. Neither are full text downloads of articles available
nor do the topics covered by the website coincide with the contents of the current
magazine edition. All of the websites offer, however, online subscription possibilities, links to other magazines marketed by the own publishing group and a
table of contents of the most current magazine issue. Self–advertisement hence
appears to play an important role in the decision to launch a website. Instead
of placing full text articles online, the magazine websites contain information
6

that might be termed ‘timeless’, meaning that they allow to gather information
that is not subject to very recent developments. Topics include recommendations
concerning furnishing, cooking, nutrition, travelling etc. Two separate website
headings also fitting in the ‘timeless’ category are ‘Beauty and fashion’, a title
that is self–explanatory, as well as ‘Love and partnership’, which usually contains
flirting and sex tips as well as recommendations for a durable partnership. Another feature that is common to all of the eight websites is the provision of an
up–to–date horoscope. Other popular website headings include:
Games of chances: website visitors are invited to take part in an online gamble.
Job & career: provides job hunting recommendations, general career perspectives discussions and in some cases even an online job market.
Chat: a possibility to chat, send e–postcards, subscribe to newsletter etc. is
offered here.
Shopping: shopping recommendations are provided here; in one case —
www.brigitte.de — products can be ordered online.
Table 4 displays the URLs of the eight websites under consideration and shows
which magazines provide the respective information.
Another potential reason to launch website is to raise additional money from
banner and pop–up advertising. The magazines, however, very sparingly use
banner–ads, not exceeding more than two banner ads per page and of sizes below
2 × 2 inches. They also do not place pop–up ads.
To summarize, the ten women’s magazines that have launched a website are
apparently aiming at the following (i) advertise the own print edition as well
as other products offered by the publishing house and (ii) provide information
complementary to the print magazine. It is also probably fair to say that another,
somewhat hidden, reason to launch a website is to signal the current and potential
readership that the magazine is ‘modern’. This argument is supported by the fact
that the magazines that went online advertise their websites on prominent places
such as the title page or the table of contents. With regard to the complementary
information provision argument and the signalling effect, it hence appears to be
reasonable to treat the existence of a website as a quality component in the
empirical analysis hereafter.

Prices and market shares

Table 5 casts a first spotlight on the women’s magazine market by displaying
magazines’ most current cover prices, least current cover prices, most current
market shares (in 2000 or in exit year), least current market shares (in 1990 or in
entry year), subscription shares (the number of subscribers over the total number
of copies sold; in 2000 or in exit year), year of the first issue and most important
consumer age group. It also contains information on the grouping of the respective magazine, a point to that I shall return to below.
Cover prices vary considerably across magazines in 2000 (and of course also in
previous years), ranging from a minimum of one DM to a maximum of 11 DM
with a mean of 3.5 DM and a median of 2.5 DM. The modulus which includes
20 per cent of all titles, is 2.5 DM and has moved up by 0.5 DM since 1990.
Mean and median prices have also increased. These aggregate price increases are
mostly due to price changes in the low price segments while, by contrast, prices
of the magazines above or equal to 4 DM have remained remarkably stable in the
ten years period.
While at least some changes occurred in the distribution of cover prices between
1990 and 2000, the distribution of market shares has remained fairly stable. Mean
and median market shares slightly increased, causing a drop in the Hirshman–
Herfindahl index of market concentration by -0.0091.

The years of the first appearances of the individual titles displayed in Table 5 describe to some extent the history of the German women’s magazine market. The
years 1948 to 1950 were characterized by a total of eight entries into the market.
Entry was comparatively modest in the following years until the early/mid 1980s,
when another eight new magazines were published. A third wave of market entry
occurred in the late 1990s, when nine women’s magazines entered the market
between 1994 and 1999. Six of them were low–price magazine costing below 1.5
DM, the other three belong to the high/medium price segment with cover prices
between 3.6 and 5 DM.
One exit, that of ‘Prima Carina’, occurs between 1990 and 2000. The most prominent market withdrawal probably is the German edition of the well–known U.S.
fashion magazine ‘Harper’s Bazaar’ which is not listed in the table.5 It entered
the market in 1987 and exited in 1992, priced 8.5 DM and with a market share
of 0.05 per cent, after experiencing a total decrease in sales by 27 per cent.

2.5

Cover prices and subscription prices

While consumers can save up to 80 per cent of a magazine’s cover price in the U.S.
in case of subscription,6 saving possibilities rom subscription are very limited in
the German women’s magazine market. A comparison of cover and subscription
prices in early October 2001 shows that for 17 magazines subscription and cover
prices are exactly the same. For three magazines, consumers can actually save
by subscribing. They can save two DM (or 28.6 per cent) when subscribing to
‘Maxi’ and 0.50 DM when subscribing to ‘Allegra’ and ‘Marie Claire’ (savings of
7.1 and 10 per cent respectively). The other magazines do not offer subscription.
The subscription share, calculated as the ratio of the number of copies sold to
subscribers and the total number of copies sold, varies considerably across the
magazines. The minimum is 0.03 per cent (‘Lea’), the maximum is 75.5 per cent
(‘Ratgeber Frau und Familie’) in 2000. Unsurprisingly, older magazines tend to
have a larger subscription share than younger magazines.
5

It was impossible for me to obtain information other than price and market share for
‘Harper’s Bazaar’ so that it is left out in the further analysis.
6
This at least was the case for a subscription to ‘U.S. news & world report’, a weekly U.S.
news magazine, in early October 2001.

Magazine contents

There is a great variety of topics covered in the women’s magazine market. A market fact–book by one of the leading German publishers (Jahreszeitenverlag 2001)
distinguishes between the following 15 topics covered by women’s magazines: (i)
‘beauty’ (fashion, cosmetics, hairdressing), (ii) ‘cooking, eating and drinking’, (iii)

career and money’, (viii) ‘computer, internet, telecommunication’, (xi) ‘politics
and economics’, (xii) ‘science, sociology, nature and technology’, (xiii) ‘art and
cultural events’, (xiv) ‘VIPs’ and (xv) ‘fiction, riddles, humor’. Jahreszeitenverlag (2001) also subdivides the German women’s magazine market into subgroups.
This grouping is, however, essentially based on price and periodicity. Given the
fact that such a grouping is not informative in terms of actual magazine contents
and hence in terms of sensitive magazine grouping, the Jahreszeitenverlag (2001)
grouping does not appear to be very useful for the Nested Logit analysis to be
conducted in Section 4.4.
Instead of following the Jahreszeitenverlag (2001) classification, I group the magazines according to their main customer age groups.7 Since magazines targeting
at the same main age groups provide similar magazine contents, this seems to be
a straightforward approach. For example, if a magazine’s most important consumer age group are purchasers aged between 20 and 29 years, this magazine is
associated with age group 20–29 as displayed in Table 5. In Table 6, some descriptive statistics on the magazine age groups are provided. Magazines that target
at consumers aged over 70 years play the most important role in the women’s
magazine market. They posses the largest market share in terms of the number
of titles, circulation share and sales share. The largest advertising share (group
advertising sales over total advertising sales) is, however, occupied by magazines
targeting 40–49 year old women. Website provision is offered only by magazines
targeting the age groups 20–29 and 40–49 years.

Information on the consumer age distribution is unavailable for ‘Prima Carina’ which
left the market before 2000. It is thus classified by myself based on content comparisons to the still existing magazines. The content information on the exited magazines was
called up at the following URLs: http://medialine.focus.de/, http://www.media-daten.de/ and

Data

The main data set used in this paper is based on a publication by Gruner +
Jahr (2001).8 It provides annual averages of (i) circulation, (ii) cover prices, (iii)
advertising prices and (iv) advertising volume for the German magazine market.
The data covers the time period 1990–2000.
Gruner + Jahr in turn takes the information concerning circulation from the ‘Information Association for the Determination of the Spread of Advertising Media’
(‘Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern
e.V’, IVW). IVW ascertains, monitors and publishes circulation and magazine
dissemination information.
The other information used in the Gruner + Jahr publication is taken from the
‘Association Media Analysis’ (‘Arbeitsgemeinschaft Media–Analyse’, AG.MA),
an association of the German advertising industry for the research of mass communication. The purpose of the AG.MA is to gather and supply data for media
audience measurement. AG.MA closely cooperates with IVW.
Additional information on the (i) number of subscribers, (ii) publication year
date of first magazine issue, (iii) the total number of pages and (iv) the total
number of advertising pages was downloaded from http://medialine.focus.de.9
This information is based on AG.MA publications as well.
Information on the total number of titles published by the women’s magazines’
publishing houses was gathered from the publishing houses’ websites, by telephone interviews and e–mail inquiries to the publishing houses.
Data on the date of the first website launch was gathered by phone calls and by

Empirical analysis
Empirical framework

Discrete–choice models of product differentiation (Anderson et al. 1992; Berry
1994) provide a somewhat natural framework for studying the determinants of
demand for women’s magazines. Internet provision is considered as a quality
characteristic, and its effect on magazine demand is analyzed using Logit and
Nested Logit models of product differentiation. In contrast to existing studies
based on these frameworks (e.g. Moral and Jaumandreu 1998; Trajtenberg 1989;
Verboven 1996; Wojcik 2000), I explicitly use the panel dimension of the data to
control for unobserved product characteristics.
Logit and Nested Logit models are comparatively simple to implement. The
simplicity, however, comes at a cost: both models place restrictive assumptions
on own and cross–price elasticities (Berry 1994; Berry et al. 1995),10 so that
recent research uses the more flexible full random coefficient model to estimate
models for differentiated product demands (Berry et al. 1995, 1997; Berry and
Pakes 1999; Davis 1998, 2000; Nevo 2000a, 2001; Petrin, 1998).11 Given that
(i) own and cross–price elasticities are of secondary interest only, (ii) estimating
these models usually implies not to explicitly use the panel character of the
data12 and (iii) estimating a random coefficients model is computationally more
burdensome,13 Logit and Nested Logit models appear to actually serve very well
10

This is due to the well–known ‘Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives’ assumption underlying multinomial logit models.
11
I term it a ‘full’ random coefficients model since the nested Logit model also is a random
coefficients model with random coefficients on the group dummy variables (see below).
12
For computational reasons, it is recommended to consider different submarkets in random
coefficient models instead of considering one single market (Nevo 2000b). If panel data is
available, each year is treated as a different market (e.g. Berry et al. 1995; Nevo 2000a,
2001) so that unobserved product heterogeneity cannot be modelled using standard panel data
technique such as fixed or random effects estimation.
13
Introducing random effects causes the market share equations to be no longer analytically
solveable, calling for simulation techniques to estimate the model.

13

for the current purpose.
The general assumption underlying models of product differentiation choice are
based on the following functional form of consumer utility,
uijt = xjt β + α pjt + τt + ξjt + ²ijt ,

(1)

where uijt denotes the utility of consumer i at time t from purchasing good j.
The vector xjt defines the characteristics of good j other than price, p, at time t.
The term ξjt denotes a product quality characteristic that is known to consumers
and producers but that is unknown to the econometrician and ²ijt denotes an
i.i.d. (across consumers and products) extreme value distributed unobserved
(to the econometrician) quality component.14 In the present case, a potentially
important quality characteristic for example is magazine design and layout. The
parameter τt represents a time–dependent utility component that is identical
across consumers and magazines, for example general shifts in consumer taste.
Consumer i’s mean utility, δjt , from consumption of good j at time t is hence
given by
δjt = xjt β + α pjt + τt + ξjt .

(2)

In the present panel data setting, the error term ξjt can be decomposed in an
individual–specific component, γi , and an i.i.d. error mean zero, variance σε
distributed component that varies across consumers and time, εit , leading to the
following error decomposition:
ξjt = γj + εjt .

(3)

The way error component γj is treated constitutes either the ‘fixed effects’ or
the ‘random effects’ model. If γj is considered as an unknown parameter specific
to each product j, this leads to the fixed effects model. If γj is assumed to
be a random variable with mean µ and variance σγ , this leads to the random
effects model. The fixed effects model does not place a priori restrictions on
the relationship between the explanatory variables and the idiosyncratic error
component, while the random effects model assumes that there is no correlation
14

Note that the vector of taste parameters β and the price coefficient α are assumed to be
constant across consumers. This is the main difference to random coefficient models where
the taste parameters are treated as consumer–specific, usually made dependent on consumer
characteristics such as age, gender, income etc.

14

between them.15
The i.i.d. extreme value distributed error term ²ijt generates the following well–
known Logit form of market shares:
exp(δjt )
sjt (δjt ) = PN
,
exp(δ
)
kt
k=1

(4)

where N denotes the total number of products and market share sjt is defined
as the number of copies sold by magazine j at time time relative to total market
size. Market size is defined as total female population in Germany older than 14
P
years at time t.16 That is, s0t = 1 − N
k=1 skt , where the subscript 0 denotes the
outside good. The utility obtained from the consumption of the outside good is
normalized to be equal to zero so that
sjt (δjt ) =

exp(δjt )
P
1 + k6=0 exp(δkt )

and s0t (δjt ) =

1+

P

1

k6=0

exp(δkt )

.

(5)

Rearranging terms and taking natural logarithms leads to Logit–type market
share estimation equations:
ln(sjt ) − ln(s0t ) ≡ δjt = xjt β + α pjt + τt + ξjt .

(6)

A general drawback of the Logit model is that it does not allow for correlation
of consumer taste across products j, a property that implies that own and cross–
price elasticities as well as the effects of other product characteristics depend upon
product j’s market shares only and are also independent of the product group
product j belongs to. The nested logit model allows for considering differences
across product groups while retaining the i.i.d. extreme value assumption of the
unobserved consumer utility component ²ijt , thereby generating a closed–form
solution for market shares as in the Logit case.
Defining djg a dummy variable which is coded one if magazine j belongs to group
g = 20 − 29, 30 − 39, 40 − 49, 70p, in the Nested Logit model consumer utility is
given by:
X
uijt = δj +
[djg ζjg ] + (1 − σ)²ijt ,
(7)
g
15

If the explanatory variables and the idiosyncratic error component are correlated with one
another, the fixed effects model is consistent and efficient, while the random effects model is
inconsistent. If there is no correlation between the explanatory variables and the idiosyncratic
error component, the fixed effects model is consistent but inefficient while the random effects
model is consistent and efficient.
16
This data is taken from Statistisches Bundesamt (various issues, 1990–1999).

15

where ²ijt is defined as above, ζ is common to all products in group g and σ
denotes the group correlation of utility levels. If σ = 1, products are perfect
substitutes and if σ = 0, products are symmetric. The market shares in the
nested Logit model are as follows:
δ

P
sjt (δjt , σ) = σ

1−σ
Dg

(8)

P
with Dg = j∈ product group g exp(δj /(1 − σ)).
With mean utility of the outside good normalized to zero, the market share
estimation equation is
ln(sjt ) − ln(s0t ) = xjt β + αpj + σln(s̄j|g ) + τt + ξjt ,

(9)

where s̄j|g denotes the share of product j in product group g.

4.2

Identification

If there was no unobserved quality component ξjt , estimation of Equation (6)
would simply require running OLS of the differences in log market shares on the
magazine characteristics including price. Since prices are a function of ξjt , an
identification problem arises. The traditional solution to the identification problem is to use instrumental–variables (IV) techniques. To my knowledge, this is
the approach followed by most of the literature on the estimation of differentiated
product demand models so far (e.g. Moral and Jaumandreu 1998; Trajtenberg
1989; Verboven 1996; Wojcik 2000). However, identification in the logit model
can also be achieved by explicitly using the time series dimension of panel data.
Recall the error term decomposition (3), ξjt = γj + εjt . If εjt follows an AR(1)
process with correlation coefficient ρ, εjt = ρεjt−1 + ςjt , and ςjt is orthogonal to
magazine prices (and quality characteristics), the price coefficient α is identified
without IV technique under the weak assumption that E[εjt−1 pjt ] = 0.
In the nested Logit model, within–group market share s̄j|g is endogenous by construction and needs to be instrumented.
Six different econometric models are estimated: (i) a IV random effect Logit
model, (ii) a IV fixed effect Logit model, (iii) a AR(1) random effect Logit model,
(iv) a AR(1) fixed effect Logit model, (v) a IV random effect nested Logit model
and (vi) a IV fixed effect nested Logit model. Due to the fact that the fixed effect
16

models are rejected by Hausman (1978) specification tests, estimation results for
the fixed effects models are not presented here.
Descriptive statistics of the variables involved in the estimations are shown in
Appendix B.

4.3

Empirical specification

The specification of the vector of product characteristics, xjt , contains the following variables: (i) magazine age and its square; (ii) the natural logarithm
of the number of magazine pages per issue and its square, ln(# of pages) and
ln(# of pages)2 , (iii) year dummy variables — representing the time–variant/magazineinvariant quality component τt — and (iv) a dummy variable for website provision, W ebsite.17
Magazine age measures how long the magazine has been on the market. On the
one hand, it takes time until consumers get to know the magazine and until the
editorial staff is able to precisely identify its target group needs, implying that
age has a positive effect on market shares. One the other hand, ‘organizational
geriatics’ (Agarwal and Gort 1996), caused e.g. by an aging editorial staff that
is faced by an on the average constantly aged readership, may lead to a decrease
in market shares. The inclusion of a linear and a squared age term allows to
calculate women’s magazines ‘senility points’.
The inclusion of the number of magazine pages in the specification is motivated
by the fact that readers may appreciate many pages, but obtain disutility if the
number of pages exceeds a certain limit which for example makes it inconvenient
to carry the magazine around due to increased weight for example.
The inclusion of the website dummy variable is straightforward given the finding
of Section 2 that website provision serves as a quality signal.
The data fortunately provide a rich set of instruments for price and within group
market share. Potential instruments for price are (i) cost variables that are not
already contained in the vector of product characteristics and (ii) cost and quality
characteristics of other magazines (Berry 1994). Likewise, potential instruments
for within group market share are cost and quality characteristics of the other
17

The age variables are not identified separately from the fixed effects in the fixed effects
model since the specification also includes time dummy variables. For that reason, they are left
out in the fixed effects models.

17

magazines in the own magazine group.
Instrument for magazine prices: cost–side variables
The following cost–side variables are used as instruments for price: (i) the natural logarithm of the number of titles issued by the own publishing house and
its square since publishers may be able to gain from production spillovers generated by other magazine titles edited by the publishing house. This positive effect
might be counteracted, however, if the organization grows ‘too big’ in the sense
that organization costs become excessive or that multiple plants, including ineffective ones, are maintained. (ii) The share of women’s magazines published by
the own publishing house in the total number of magazines published by the own
publishing house. The higher the ratio is, the lower should marginal production
cost be.
Instrument for magazine prices: characteristics of other magazines
Other instruments for magazine prices are the averages of quality characteristics
of magazines other than the magazine under consideration, namely (iii) average
magazine age and (iv) the average number of magazine pages. Finally, the mean
order of entry into the four magazines subgroups (excluding the magazine in
question) is used as an instrument for price as well. To construct this variable,
for each magazine a variable reflecting its order of entry into each subgroup of
the women’s magazine market is constructed.
Instrument for within group market shares
Within–group shares s̄j|g is instrumented by the following set of variables: (i)
‘potential within group market reach’ of magazines other than magazine j and
(ii) the order of entry in magazine group g. ‘Potential market reach’ is a variable which is measured as the ratio of the number of potential magazine readers
relative to the total German population. It is based on a large survey conducted
by AG.MA. The argument behind the inclusion of this variable is that the larger
potential within group market share is, the larger should actual market share be.
The argument for the inclusion for the order of entry is basically the same as for
the inclusion of magazine age in the vector of product characteristics with the
main difference being that the order of entry is uncorrelated with current prices.

Estimation results

The estimation results for three Logit models are presented in Table 7: (i) an IV
random effects Logit model, (ii) an AR(1) random effects Logit model and (iii)
an AR(1) fixed effects Logit model. Fixed effects are rejected for the IV logit
model so that the related estimation results are not displayed here.18
The instrumental–variables models are estimated using two stage technique as
described by Baltagi (1995, Ch. 7.1). Appendix C displays the first–stage estimation results for the price equation and the Logit model, while Appendix D
shows first–stage estimation results for the nested Logit model. Both Appendices
are informative with respect to the quality of the instrumentation. They both
show that the instruments are both individually and jointly insignificant in the
demand equations but highly significant in the instrumental–variables equations.
Appendix C and Appendix D hence confirm the choice of the instrumentation.
By and large, the estimation results for the three different econometric models
are surprisingly similar, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The coefficient
of price is between -0.0609 and -0.1131 and is, with exception of the IV Logit
model where it is significantly different from zero at the ten per cent marginal
significance level only, very precisely estimated.
Website provision significantly affects magazine demand only in the IV Logit
model specification. The effect is positive, indicating that website provision is
valued by consumers as a quality characteristic and hence props up magazine demand. The robustness of this finding is challenged, however, by the insignificant
effects of website provision in all other specifications being estimated, including
the IV nested logit model.
Magazine age does not have a significant effect in all of the random effects specification displayed in Table 7. The number of pages per issue has a convex effect
on relative market share with a minimum reached at magazine sizes between 105
and 144 pages. This result is surprising at least at first sight. The explanation
for a convex effect of magazine size on relative demand is that the low–priced
magazines which come with a comparatively low page size per issue possess a
relatively high market share. The year dummy variables are jointly significantly
different from zero, suggesting that there are significant changes in market structure over time. The signs and magnitude of the year–dummy variables indicate

of the instrumental–variables.

a marked increased in demand in 1991, the year after the German reunification,
and a continuous decline in demand after 1994.
The estimated autocorrelation coefficient, ρ, is large in magnitude. Critical values for tests for autocorrelation in panel data models are, however, not tabulated
so that an explicit test for autocorrelation does not readily apply here (Baltagi
and Wu 1999).
Nested Logit estimation results are presented in Table 8. Although the nested

Logit model is the more flexible approach with respect to substitution patterns
so that similarity of results cannot be expected a priori, the estimated coefficients
are very similar to the ones displayed in Table 8.
Website provision has a positive, yet insignificant, effect on magazine demand.
The price–coefficient is -0.1066 and is hence in the same range as in the simple
Logit models. The within–group share coefficients σ is highly significantly different from zero and quite large in absolute magnitude, suggesting that there is
considerable within–group correlation of utilities.
Magazine age again has a concave effect on mean utility (maximum: 48 years) and
20

the number of pages has a convex effect on mean utility (minimum: 121 pages).
The same time–pattern in magazine demand as for the simple Logit model are
found.
Although website provision does not have a significant effect on magazine demand, its coefficient is positive and relatively quite large in all specifications.
Since the dependent variable is specified in log, a coefficient of 0.0297 as in the
IV nested Logit model implies an increase in market shares of 2.97 percent relative to the market share of the outside good. Moreover, one might expect that
the effect of website provision is larger for magazines aiming at younger than for
magazine focussing on older women. Therefore, column ‘Counter–factual website
effect’ in Table 9 displays, (i) for magazines that provide a website the quantitative effect of going offline (under the assumption that the other magazines
do not change their website strategy) and (ii) for magazines that are offline the
quantitative effect of going online (again under the assumption that the other
magazines do not change their website strategy). Hence, this column provides
counter–factual evidence on the effect of presence/absence of website provision.
It turns out the the effect of going online does not differ much across magazines
that actually are online. The quantitative effect indicates demand decreases between 0.26 and 0.32 per cent. Much more differences of website effects are present
for magazines that are not online. Unsurprisingly, the website effect is smallest
for magazines targeting at consumers aged 70 and above. It is largest for magazines focussing on purchasers aged between 30 and 39 years. Interestingly, the
third–largest winner of a potential website launch, ‘Bild der Frau’, actually went
online in 2001 (www.bildderfrau.de). It’s potential market share gain is 0.33
per cent. Another potential winner that launched a website in 2001 is ‘Für Sie’
(www.fuersie.de). The market share gain is 0.29 per cent in that case.
Table 9 also displays own–price elasticities for the IV nested Logit specification.
Own–price elasticities are given by:19
ηsjt ,

pjt

=

1
[1 − σs̄jt|g − (1 − σ) sjt ] α pjt ,
1−σ

(10)

so that the point estimate of 0.25 for σ implies that own–price elasticities depend
to a larger extent on the absolute market shares, sjt , rather than on within–group
market shares, s̄jt|g . All figures displayed in Table 9 correspond to 2000. By construction of the nested Logit model, own–price elasticities are highly negatively

The own–price elasticities for the Logit model are obtained by setting σ = 0.

correlated with cover prices.
Finally, I experimented with alternative specifications for website provision.
These specifications replaced the dummy variable for website provision by (i) interactions between magazine group dummy variables and the indicator variable
for website provision, (ii) interacting magazine prices with a dummy variables
for ever having launched a website and (iii) interacting magazine prices with a
dummy variables for contemporaneous website provision. None of these alternative specifications leads to statistically significant effects of website provision on
market shares.

Conclusion

Descriptive and econometric evidence on the effect of website provision on market
shares suggests a simple answer to the initially asked question about the effects
of going online on market demand. Neither is evidence provided that website
provision props up magazine demand nor that it leads to a decrease in market
shares.
The empirical evidence is provided for the German women’s magazine market,
a particularly large segment of the German publishing market which is characterized by fierce competition among magazine titles. Eight out of 41 magazines
run websites in 2000, a number that steadily increased since 1996 when the first
three magazines went online. By and large, magazines which provide a website
are those with a consumer structure that uses the internet more often at home
and/or at work and also is more likely to have internet access in general compared
to the magazines that are still offline.
An analysis of the women’s magazines websites shows that magazines mainly use
their website to provide information that is supplementary to the contents of the
current print issue and to advertise the current print issue as well as other products published by their publishing houses. With regard to these facts, consumer
substitution in favor of the online media and in disfavor of the printed media
does not appear to be reasonable.
Instead, website provision seems to serve as a quality signal to consumers. It is
hence treated as a quality characteristic within a differentiated product demands
framework in the econometric analysis. Panel data estimations including a to-

22

tal of 368 observations on 41 magazines observed between 1990 to 2000 indicate
that website provision does not significantly affect women’s magazines market
shares. A counter–factual analysis that asks what happened to demand if an
online magazine went back offline and vice versa shows, however, that changes
in market shares due to website provision are in some cases quite sizeable. If a
magazine that already is online and withdraws its website, the estimated loss in
market shares is around 0.3 per cent. Potential gains from launching a website
are largest for magazines targeting women aged between 30 and 39. Interestingly,
one of the largest potential winners, ‘Bild der Frau’, actually went online in 2001.
Future research will include an analysis of the news magazine market, where substitution between internet information and magazine information is more likely
due to the large overlap in contents between the online and the printed media.
