ABSTRACT
We develop a novel system of re-classifying historical exchange rate regimes. One difference
between our study and previous classification efforts is that we employ an extensive data base on
market-determined parallel exchange rates. Our “natural” classification algorithm leads to a stark
reassessment of the post-war history of exchange rate arrangements. When the official categorization is
a form of peg, roughly half the time our classification reveals the true underlying monetary regime to be
something radically different, often a variant of a float. Conversely, when official classification is
floating, our scheme routinely suggests that the reality was a form of de facto peg. Our new classification
scheme points to a complete rethinking of economic performance under alternative exchange rate
regimes. Indeed, the breakup of Bretton Woods had a far less dramatic impact on most exchange rate
regimes than is popularly believed. Also, contrary to an influential empirical literature, our evidence
suggests that exchange rate arraignments may be quite important for growth, trade and inflation. Our
newly compiled monthly data set on market-determined exchange rates goes back to 1946 for 153
countries.

I. Introduction
Contemporary thinking on the costs and benefits of exchange rate flexibility is
heavily influenced by the large number of studies on the empirical differences in growth,
trade, inflation, business cycles, and commodity price behavior across different exchange rate
arrangements. These include the influential work of Baxter and Stockman (1989) and Flood
and Rose (1995), both of whom failed to detect any significant difference across fixed and
floating rates, except for the volatility of real exchange rates that Mussa (1986) had already
noted. Nearly all such studies have relied on the official or “standard” classification
published in the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Rate Arrangements and Exchange
Restrictions which, until recently, asked member states to self-declare their arrangement as
belonging to one of four categories (fixed, limited flexibility, managed floating, and
independently floating). Yet, a closer reading of the experience suggests that these official
classifications often fail to describe actual country practice, implying that the gap between de
facto and de jure can be vast. A few previous studies have attempted to either extend the
four-way official classification into a more informative meaningful taxonomy (see Gosh et.
al., 1997), or have relied on purely statistical methods to regroup country practices (see,
Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger, 2002).1 The Fund, recognizing the limitations of its former
strategy, significantly revised and upgraded the standard official approach toward classifying
exchange rate arrangements in 1997, though it did not re-evaluate its historical classification
after the fact. Notably, all previous approaches to exchange rate regime classification,

whether or not they accept the country’s declared regime, have been based almost solely on
official exchange rate series.
One problem with the pre-1997 official classification that has received substantial
attention in the recent literature is the frequency of episodes where the regime is classified as
floating (independently or managed) when, in effect, the country had a de facto peg or
crawling peg.2 However, a less well known but equally serious problem, shared even by the
small number of earlier efforts to reclassify regimes, is that the officially-reported exchange
rate itself is often profoundly misleading. Over the course of post-World War II history,
virtually every country has relied, at one time or another, on capital controls and/or multiple
exchange rate systems.3 By failing to look at market-determined exchange rates, one often
gets a false picture of the underlying monetary policy and the ability of the economy to adjust
imbalances. When there are dual or parallel markets, a regime that is officially labeled a peg
might easily turn out to be a de facto float or a crawling band. As an illustration suppose, for
example, that the parallel market rate undergoes sustained and significant depreciation but
the official rate remains fixed. (Over the broad sweep of post-war history, we find this a
common occurrence.) Then the underlying monetary policy is inflationary, but the effects on
the official nominal exchange rate are effectively masked–at least in the short run--by an
ever-increasing tariff. By far the most common outcome in these circumstances is that the

Edwards (1989) stresses the inadequacy of official exchange rate data for the many Latin American economies
with multiple exchange rates.

-3-

official rate is ultimately devalued, thus validating what had already transpired in the free
market.
Thus when there are dual markets, it is not sufficient to just discard the official
exchange rate classification. One very often also has to discard the official rate, which can
be meaningless and far removed from the rate at which transactions take place. Another
difference from other studies that have tackled the regime classification issue is that our
approach relies on extensive historical chronologies that allow us to identify when dual or
multiple rates are in place or when parallel markets are active. In the vast majority of these
cases, our data set contains monthly data on dual/parallel market exchange rates from 1946
through 1998, and we use these data to assess whether, from a monetary perspective, the true
de facto regime corresponds to the stated de jure regime. Very often—roughly half the time
for official pegs over the post-1970 period—we find that dual/parallel rates have been used
as a form of back-door floating.4 Lastly, we rely on a large battery of descriptive statistics to
classify exchange rate arrangements into as many as 15 categories. We argue that both pieces
of information—historical chronologies and data on market-determined exchange rates--are
essential to any meaningful classification algorithm.
We note also that the IMF’s monthly data on exchange rates—which only includes
the official rate—currently begin in 1957, whereas ours begin in 1946. Our analysis is
extremely comprehensive, covering 153 countries. Since exchange rate regimes are often

The IMF data for official exchange rates begins on January 1957 for most countries. We also compiled data
on official exchange rates from 1946 through 1957; see appendix.

-4-

mixed within a given year, our methodology captures regimes changes by month; all
previous approaches have used only annual classifications.5
The highlights of our findings can be summarized as follows:
First, dual or multiple rates, and/or parallel markets were far more commonplace that
is commonly thought.6 In 1950, 45 percent of the countries in our sample had dual rates, not
to mention many more that had thriving illegal parallel markets! Among the industrialized
economies, dual or multiple rates were the norm in the 1940s and the 1950s and, in some
cases, lasted until much later. Those countries that clung to dual or multiple exchange rates
were important actors on the world stage and included the United Kingdom in the 1970s,
Italy in the 1980s, and Belgium and Luxembourg until 1990. 7 Among developing countries
such practices remained relatively commonplace through the 1980s. Going back as recently
as 1980, 32 percent of countries had dual rates. In the 1990s, the number still stood at
approximately 20 percent, including some of the largest emerging markets.
Second, when one uses market-determined rates in place of official rates, the history
of exchange rate policy suddenly begins to look very different. In particular, it becomes
obvious that de facto floating was not uncommon during the so-called Bretton Woods era of
“pegged” exchange rates. Indeed, for many countries, it is difficult to detect any change in
exchange rate behavior between the two periods (provided one focuses on market-determined

5

See Côté (1994) for a survey of this literature.

6

When we refer multiple exchange rates in this context, we are focusing on the cases where one or more of the
rates was market-determined. This is very different from the cases where the multiple official rates are all fixed
and simply act as a differential tax on a variety of transactions.

7

Of course, over the more recent period the differences in rates was relatively trivial.

-5-

rates). The main impact of the dissolution of Bretton Woods was on G-3 currencies, the US
dollar, the Yen, and the mark. Remarkably, in our “natural” classification scheme, we find
that for about 45 percent of the time official pegs are better characterized as managed or
freely floating arrangements, or limited flexibility. Indeed, we find that very often, an
official “peg” masks an underlying 12-month inflation rate greater than 40 percent. Thus,
nearly half of the official “pegs” turn out to have exhibited far more exchange rate flexibility
than was reported to the IMF. Conversely, many “floats” of the post-1980s turn out to be (de
facto) pegs, crawling pegs, or very narrow bands (often narrower than Bretton Woods
period). Of countries that are listed in the standard classification as managed floating, 53
percent turned out to have de facto pegs, crawls or narrow bands to some anchor currency.
Third, next to pegs (which account for 33 percent of the observations during 19702001, according to our new classification scheme) the most popular exchange rate regime
over modern history has been the crawling peg or narrow crawling band, which account for
over 26 percent of the observations. During 1990 to 2001, this is the most common type of
arrangement in emerging Asia and Western Hemisphere (excluding Canada and the United
States), making up for about 36 and 42 percent of the observations, respectively.
Fourth, in our taxonomy, the extreme macroeconomic distresses associated with
inflation over 40% per annum—we term the underlying exchange rate regimes “freely
falling”—are not uncommon. In our sample, about 12½ percent of the observations are in
the freely falling category—which is to say that “freely falling” is about three times as
common as “freely floating”, which accounts for only 4½ percent of the total observations.
(In the official classification, freely floating accounts for over 30 percent of observations in
the past decade, more than three times our estimate.) Our new freely falling classification

-6-

makes up for 22 and 37 percent of the observations in Africa and Western Hemisphere
(excluding Canada and the United States) during 1970-2001.8 In the 1990s, freely falling
accounted for 41 percent of the observations for the transition economies. Given the
distortions introduced when inflation rises to 40 percent and beyond, any fixed versus
flexible exchange rate regime comparisons that do not break out the freely falling episodes
are meaningless, as shall confirm.
In light of the evidence we collect, we conjecture that the surprising and provocative
results in Baxter and Stockman (1989) and Flood and Rose (1995)—that there are no
significant differences in business cycles across exchange arrangements— may owe to the
fact that the official historical groupings of exchange rates are misleading.9 Similar
statements could be made about the literature that has concluded that exchange rate volatility
has little impact on trade, as all studies relied exclusively on the official exchange rate. At
one time or another, in every region of the world, parallel/dual markets have been
commonplace.
The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we briefly describe the evolution
of the official standard annual classification scheme, that has served as the basis for so many
studies. Unlike our classification, which is by month, the official classification imposes the
same regime on the entire year. In Section III, we sketch our methodology for re-classifying
exchange rate arrangements with details provided in an Appendix. Our approach recognizes
8

We also include in the freely falling category the first six months following an exchange rate crisis (see
Appendix II for definitions), but only for those cases where the crisis marked a transition from a peg or quasipeg to a managed or independent float.
9

Indeed, in light of our results, it is difficult to discern the “puzzle” that recent research is still trying to explain
as in Dedola and Leduc (2001).

-7-

that an exchange rate regime is difficult to ascertain from one month’s or even one-year’s
worth of data. Section IV compares our results to the “official history” and provides
examples of how our reclassification of exchange rate arrangements may reshape the some of
the existing evidence on the links between exchange rates and various facets of economic
activity. The final section discusses the scope for future research, while an Appendix
provides the detailed country exchange rate chronologies that underpin our analysis. Our
conclusions issue a call for rethinking how the profession should look at the impact of
exchange rate regimes, both at a theoretical and at an empirical level.
II. The Standard Classification
Classification schemes, for anything, have always been controversial. Dating back to
Aristotle, there arose two kinds of classificatory schemes for animals and plants, the socalled “artificial” and “natural” systems. Artificial systems placed organic species into wellmarked groups, using a few, sometimes even a single, characteristic for the purposes of
classification. Natural systems, on the other hand, aimed to bring the diverse organic species
into natural families, in which there was a continuity of creatures.10 The standard official
classification prior to 1997, as described in various issues of the IMF’s Annual Report on
Exchange Rate Arrangements and Exchange Rate Restrictions, would seem to fall squarely
into the “artificial” system category. As shown in Table 1, initially there were only two
buckets, par (fixed) and “other”. Later, the classification expanded to three, then four,
buckets. The four-bucket classification that prevailed through most of the 1980s and 1990s
10

The French Naturalists of the 18th century were the strongest advocates of the “natural” classification scheme,
as explained in Mason (1962).

-8-

consisted of peg, limited flexibility, more flexible arrangements, and independently
floating.11 Aside from the small number of buckets, the pre-1997 official categorization was
also “artificial” —in the sense of Aristotle—in that it relied exclusively on a single piece of
information; namely it took at face value whatever each government declared its exchange
rate regime to be in any given year. The post-1997 system, though dramatically improved, is
still based mainly on the official rate.

11

In practice, limited flexibility has, almost exclusively, been used to classify European countries (prior to the
monetary union) with exchange rate arrangements vis-à-vis one another (i.e., the Snake, the Exchange Rate
Mechanism, etc.).

The critical importance of taking into account dual/parallel rates can be seen in Chart
1, which gives the distribution of regimes, with and without stripping out cases of
dual/parallel markets. The light bars are the official classification; the dark bars separate out
dual markets.12 Note, for example, that according to the official classification, pegs reigned
supreme in the early 1970s, accounting for over 90 percent of all exchange rate
arrangements. But, in fact, over half of these “pegs” masked dual/parallel markets that, as
we shall, quite often exhibited quite different behavior.
III. The “Natural” Classification Code: A Guide
In contrast to the “artificial” official classification of exchange rate arrangements, we
would describe our classification scheme as a “natural” system. Our algorithm relies on a
broad variety of descriptive statistics and chronologies, and we group episodes into a much
finer grid of regimes, rather than just three or four buckets. The most important new piece of
information we bring to bear, of course, is our extensive data series on market-determined
dual or parallel rates. The data, its sources, and country coverage are described in Appendix
I, while the chronologies that map the history of exchange rate arrangements for each country
are reported in Appendix III. To verify and classify regimes, we also rely on a variety of
descriptive statistics based on exchange rate and inflation data from 1946 onwards; these
statistics and how they are used are described in detail in Appendix II.

12

In Chart I, the dark bars treat dual rates separately, the unified rate regimes are classified according to our
“natural algorithm,” discussed below.

- 11 -

1. The algorithm
Figure 1 is a schematic summarizing our natural classification algorithm. First, we
use the chronologies (see Appendix III) to sort out for separate treatment countries with
either official dual or multiple rates or active parallel (black) markets. Second, if there is no
dual or black market, we check to see if there is an official pre-announced arrangement, such
a peg or band, etc. If there is, we examine summary statistics to verify the announced
regime, going forward from the date of the announcement. If the regime is verified (i.e.,
exchange rate behavior accords with the pre-announced policy), it is then classified
accordingly as a peg, crawling peg, etc. If the announcement fails verification (which is the
most common outcome), we then seek a de facto statistical classification using the algorithm
described below, and discussed in greater detail in Appendix II.
Third, if there is no pre-announced path for the exchange rate, or the announced
regime fails to be verified by the data and the twelve-month rate of inflation is below 40
percent, we classify the regime on the basis of actual exchange rate behavior.

Our statistical measures include rolling two-year and five-year moving average
measures of volatility (see Appendix II). The longer five-year window has priority, in order
that the monthly exchange rate behavior is appropriately viewed as part of a larger regime.
(We also examined the graphical evidence as a check on the classification. In practice, the
main effect is to allow one to more reliably separate pegs from crawling pegs or bands, and
to mark more finely the latter between moving pegs or crawling bands.)
Fourth, as discussed below, an important departure from all previous classification
schemes is that we create a new separate category for countries whose twelve-month rate of
inflation is above 40 percent. These episodes are classified as freely falling.13 If the country
is in a hyperinflation (according to the classic Cagan definition of 50 percent or more
monthly inflation), we categorize the exchange rate as a hyperfloat, a sub-species of freely
falling. In Chart 2, exchange rates are plotted for two countries that were classified officially
as floating over much of that period—Canada and Argentina. 14 Argentina experienced a bout
of hyperinflation and as Chart 2 illustrates, freely floating regimes look rather different from
freely falling regimes—witness the orders of magnitude difference in the range of the Yscales between Canada (top of page) and Argentina (bottom). This difference is highlighted
in the middle panel, which plots the Canadian dollar-US dollar rate against Argentina’s Yscale; from this perspective it looks like a fixed rate! The exchange rate profile of other

13

In the highly exceptional cases where, despite inflation over 40%, the market rate
nevertheless follows a confirmed, pre-announced band or crawl, the pre-announced regime
takes precedence.
14

For Argentina, this of course, refers to the period before the Convertibility Plan was
introduced in April 1991.

- 14 -

countries which experienced chronic high inflation bouts—even if these did not reach the
hyperinflation stage--look more similar to Argentina in Chart 2, than to Canada. In our view,
regimes associated with the myriad of problems that result from very high inflation should
not be lumped under the same exchange rate arrangement as low inflation floating regimes,
certainly not if one wants to contrast the macroeconomic implications of alternative exchange
rate regimes.
In step five, we take up those residual regimes that have not already been classified
by steps one through four. These regimes become candidates for “managed” or “freely”
floating.15 To distinguish between the two, we perform some simple tests (described in detail
in Appendix II) that look at the likelihood the exchange rate will move within a narrow
range, as well as the mean absolute value of exchange rate changes.
When there are dual or parallel markets, we apply steps one through five to our data
on parallel exchange rates and reclassify accordingly, though in our finer grid, dual rates as a
whole also constitute a separate “species.”
2. Using the chronologies
The 153 individual country chronologies in Appendix II are the central point of
departure from all previous efforts. In the first instance, the data are constructed by culling
information from annual issues of various secondary sources, including Pick’s Currency
Yearbook, Pick’s World Currency Report, Pick’s Black Market Yearbook, International
Financial Statistics, the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Rate Arrangements and
Exchange Restrictions, and the United Nations Yearbook. Generally speaking, constructing
15

Our classification of “freely floating” is the analogue of “independently floating” in the official classification.

- 15 -

our data set required us to sort and interpret information for every year from every
publication above. In addition, however, we draw on national sources to investigate apparent
data errors or inconsistencies. More generally, we rely on the broader economics literature to
include pertinent information not to be found in our secondary sources, such as the dates of
Tablita episodes in Latin America.
The chronologies allow us to date dual or multiple exchange rate episodes, as well as
to differentiate between pre-announced pegs, crawling pegs, and bands from their de facto
counterparts. We think it is important to distinguish between, say, de facto pegs and
announced (confirmed) pegs, because their properties are potentially different. 16 At the
very least, we want to provide future researchers with the data needed to ask the question.
The chronologies also flag the dates for important turning points, such as when the exchange
rate was allowed to float or a currency was repegged from one anchor currency to another.
Table 2 gives an example of one of our 153 chronologies shown in Appendix III, for
the case of Chile. The first column gives critical dates. Note that where possible, we extend
our chronologies back before 1946 (even though we can only classify from 1946 onwards);
in the case of Chile we go back to 1932. The second column gives the arrangement,
according to our natural classification algorithm, which may or (much more often) not
correspond to the official classification. As one can see, although Chile unified rates on
September 1999, it previously had some form of dual or multiple rates throughout most of its

16

Policymakers may not be indifferent between the two. In theory, at least, announcements
of pegs, bands, and so on can act as a coordinating device which, by virtue of being more
transparent, could invite speculative attacks.

- 16 -

history.17 In these circumstances, our classification algorithm relies on the marketdetermined, rather than the official rate. In some instances, the discrepancy proved to be
small. For example, from September 1998-December 1998, the official regime was a preannounced crawling band to the dollar; our statistical algorithm confirms this band even for
the dual rate. Chile has also experienced several periods where the twelve-month monthly
inflation exceeded 40 percent. Our algorithm automatically categorizes these as freely falling
exchange rate regimes—unless there is a pre-announced peg crawling peg or narrow band
that is verified, as was the case when the Tablita program was introduced on February 1978.
For the freely falling cases, the second column also notes whether there was a dual market
and how our algorithm would categorize the regime absent knowledge of the inflation rate.
The third column in our chronology gives further sundry information on the regime—
information we believe to be particularly important, e.g., the width of the announced and de
facto bands. For Chile, which followed a crawling band policy over many sub-periods, it is
particularly interesting to note the changes over time in the width of the bands. Information
on the performance of the parallel market premia is also presented in the third column, as is
information on currency reform. As an example of the former, we note that since 1992 the
parallel premium slipped into single digits. An example of the latter is given for Chile when
the peso replaced the escudo in 1975.

17

Of course, since 1992 the difference between the official and parallel rate has been trivial.

The top panel of Chart 3 plots the path of exchange rate for Chile. It is evident that
through much of the period shown the arrangement was one of a crawling peg or a crawling
band with the rate of crawl varying through time and notably slowing as inflation began to
stabilize following the Tablita plan of the early 1980s. As we will discuss in the next Section
crawling pegs or bands are not at all unusual and, indeed, quite commonplace. The two
bottom panels of Chart 3, which show the path of the exchange rate for India and Greece
provide other examples of the many crawling pegs or bands in our sample.
3. About the data
As noted, we use monthly data on official and market-determined exchange rates for
the period 1946-1998. In some instances, the data for the market-determined rate is
available for a shorter period and Appendix I provides the particulars on a country-bycountry basis. The market-determined exchange rate data comes from various issues Pick’s
Currency Yearbook, Pick’s Black Market Yearbooks, and Pick’s World Currency Report and
the official rate comes from the same sources and as well as the IMF. The quotes are end of
month exchange rates and are not subject to revisions. For the countries that had one ore
more monetary reforms, involving changes in the units in which the exchange rate is
expressed, the data has been converted as necessary to ensure continuity.
While the quality of data on market-determined rates is likely to vary across countries
and time, we believe these data to be reliable and generally far better indicators of the
underlying monetary policy than are official rates. For instance, if monetary policy is more
lax than is consistent with maintaining the official exchange rate unchanged one would
expect the market-determined rate to start depreciating ahead of the official realignment.
When the official realignment occurs—it is simply a validation of what had previously

- 19 -

transpired in the free market. Indeed, this is the pattern shown in the three panels of Chart 4
for the cases of Bolivia, Indonesia, and Iran. This pattern also emerges in the developed
European economies and Japan in the years following World War II; it is quite typical.
To illustrate more formally that the market-based exchange rate is a better indicator
of the monetary policy stance than the official rate and that changes in the former
systematically predict changes in the latter, we regressed for each of the developing countries
in our sample a currency crash dummy on the parallel market premia lagged one to six
months.18 If the market rate consistently anticipates devaluations of the official rate, its
coefficient should be positive and significant. If, in turn, the official exchange rate does not
validate the market rate then, the coefficient on the lagged market exchange rate will be
negative. As shown in Table 3, in the overwhelming number of cases (97 percent), the
coefficient on the market-determined exchange rate is positive and consistent with the view
that the monetary policy stance is better reflected in market rates. In about 81 percent of the
cases, the sign on the coefficient was positive and statistically significant. Indeed, for
Western Hemisphere as a region the coefficient on the parallel premia was significant I all
the cases.

Two definitions of currency crashes are used. A severe currency crash refers to a 25% or higher monthly
depreciation which is at least 10% higher than the previous month’s depreciation. The “milder” version
represents a 12.5% monthly depreciation which is at least 10% above the preceding month’s depreciation; see
details in Appendix II. To put in perspective the monthly depreciations annualized are 1, 355% and 310%,
respectively.

IV. The “Artificial” and “Natural” Taxonomies of Exchange Rate Arrangements
We are now prepared to offer some broad descriptive statistics about our “natural”
classification scheme and how it compares to the standard “artificial” one.
1. Alternative taxonomies: comparing the basic categories
Altogether, our taxonomy of exchange rate arrangements includes the 14
classifications sketched in Table 4 (15 if hyperfloats are treated as a separate category).
Because we sometimes want to compare our classification regime with the official one, we
can also collapse our 14 types of arrangements into 5 broader categories. The least flexible
arrangements are assigned lower values in our scale as shown in the second column of Table
4.
In the finer grid, we distinguish between pre-announced policies and the less
transparent de facto regimes. Since the former involve an explicit announcement while the
latter leaves it to financial market analysts to figure out what the implicit exchange rate
policy is, in the finer classification we treat pre-announcement as less flexible than de facto
and accordingly assign it a lower number in our scale. For those not interested in testing
whether announcements serve as a coordinating device (say to make a speculative attack

- 21 -

more likely) and are exclusively interested in sorting out the degree of observed exchange
rate flexibility, the bottom panel of Table 4 presents a coarser ranking according to the
degree of flexibility from one to five. However, in both the coarse and fine grid, it is
imperative to treat freely falling as a separate category. These sorting strategies categorize
cover the period January 1946-December 2001 for those with unified rates, and January
1946-December 1998 for those countries with dual markets.

2. Fact and fiction: Natural and Artificial?
We are now prepared to contrast the official view of the history of exchange rate
regimes with the view that emerges from employing our alternative methodology. To
facilitate comparisons, we will focus mainly on the coarse grid version of the natural system.
For example, in 1950, the IMF’s then two tier classification (peg and “other”) had 65
percent of countries listed as pegs, as Chart 5 illustrates. As one can also see from Chart 5,
according to our natural classification system, less than forty percent of all regimes at this
time were pegs (since countries had dual/parallel rates which did not qualify as pegs.) In
fact, this coarse comparison understates the differences between the two classification
systems since some of our “pegs” were not considered pegs under the official classification;
in turn, our algorithm rejects almost half of the official pegs as true pegs. It is worth noting
that our reclassification of the early post-war years impacts not only on developing countries,
but on industrialized countries as well; nearly all the European countries had active parallel
markets after World War II.
A second (less important) reason why our scheme shows less pegs is that the IMF’s
pre-1997 allowed countries to declare their regimes as pegged to an undisclosed basket of
currencies. This practice was especially popular during the 1980s, and it was under the
umbrella of pegging to an undisclosed basket of currencies that a great deal of managed
floating, freely floating and freely falling actually took place.
For the period 1974-1990, the official classification has roughly 60 percent of all
regimes as pegs; our classification has only half as many. Again, as we shall see shortly, this
comparison understates the differences since some of our pegs are not official pegs. For the
years 1974-1990, and 1991-2001, one can see two major trends. First, “freely falling”

- 23 -

continues to be a significant category, accounting for 12 percent of all regimes from 19741990, and 13 percent of all regimes from 1991-2001. For the transition economies in the
1990s, over 40 percent of the observations are in the freely falling category. Table 5 looks at
what kinds of official exchange rate regimes are most closely associated with our freely
falling category. We find that peg, managed floating and independently floating contribute
in almost equal measure to our freely falling category. Only limited flexibility–a relatively
small group of mostly European countries in the official classification–is not associated with
freely falling. The last item in the table shows that 62 percent of all freely falling exchange
rate systems took place under the guise of dual rates.

Second, the natural classification scheme reveals a bunching to the middle in terms of
exchange rate flexibility, when compared to the official monetary history of the world.
Limited flexibility – which under the natural classification is dominated by de facto crawling
pegs – becomes notably more important. From being a very small class under the official
scheme, the natural classification algorithm elevates limited flexibility to the second most
important grouping over the past decade, just behind pegs. Another startling difference is the

- 24 -

reduced importance of freely floating. According to the official classification, more than 30
percent of countries were independently floating during 1991-2001. According to the natural
classification, less than 10 percent were freely floating. This is partly a manifestation of
what Calvo and Reinhart (2002) term “fear of floating”, but equally because we assign high
inflation floats to our new freely falling category. Indeed, more countries had freely falling
exchange rates than had freely floating exchange rates!
The contrast between the old and new classification systems becomes even more
striking when one sees just now small the overlap is between the two classifications country
by country, month by month. As we can see from Table 6, if the official designation of the
regime is a peg (1970-2001), there is a 44 percent chance our algorithm will categorize it into
a more flexible arrangement. If the official regime is a float, there is a 31 percent chance we
will categorize it as a peg or limited flexibility. If the official regime is a managed float,
there is 53 percent chance our algorithm will categorize it as a peg or limited flexibility.
Whether the official regime is a float or peg, it is virtually a coin toss whether the natural
algorithm will yield the same result. The bottom of the table gives the pairwise correlation
between the two classifications, with the official classification running from 1 (peg) to 4
(independently floating), and the natural classification running from 1 (peg) to 5 (freely
falling). The simple correlation coefficient is only .42. As one can confirm from the
chronologies, the greatest overlap occurs in the classification of the G3 currencies and of the
limited flexibility European arrangements. Elsewhere, and especially in developing
countries, the two classifications differ significantly, as we shall see.

3. The pegs that float
Chart 6 plots the parallel market premium since January 1946, in percent, for Africa,
Asia, Europe and Western Hemisphere. As is evident from the Chart, for all the regions
except Europe, it would be difficult to make the case that the breakdown of Bretton Woods
was a singular event, let alone a sea change. The levels of pre- and post-1973 volatilities in
the market determined exchange rate—as revealed by the parallel market premia are
remarkably similar for the developing world. Note that for all regions, we exclude the freely
falling episodes which would significantly increase the volatility but also distort the scale.
As regards Europe, the story told by Chart 6 is even more surprising. From 1946
until the arrival of the 1960s, Europe was de facto floating under the guise of pegged official
exchange rates. Each time official rates were realigned, the story had already unfolded in the
parallel market. While the volatility of the gap between the official rate and the market
exchange rate is not quite in the order of magnitude observed in the developing world, the

- 26 -

volatility of the parallel rate is quite similar to the volatility of today’s managed or freely
floating exchange rates. The disappearance of the premia at such a late stage—the 1960s-suggests that the duration of the “true” Bretton Woods system of pegged exchange rates was
much shorter lived than most textbooks suggest. As show earlier for Chile and India in the
top two panels of Chart 2, there are many interesting country examples that illustrate visually
just how little changed before and after the breakup of Bretton Woods. Clearly, more
careful statistical testing is required to make categorical statements about when a structural
break took place; but it is obvious from the charts that whatever break might have taken place
must be relatively minor quantitatively compared to usual image of the move from fixed to
flexible rates.
4. The floats that peg
Chart 7 provides a more general flavor of how exchange rate flexibility has evolved
over time and across regions. The chart plots five-year moving averages of the probability
that the monthly percent change in the exchange rate remains within a two percent band for
Africa, Asia, Europe and Western Hemisphere (excluding only the United States). Hence,
under a pegged arrangement, assuming no adjustments to the parity are made, these
probabilities should equal 100 percent. As before, we exclude the freely falling episodes.
For comparison purposes, the figures plot the unweighted regional averages against the
unweighted averages for the “committed floaters”. (The committed floaters group include
the following exchange rates against the dollar: Yen, DM (Euro), Australian dollar, and the
Pound Sterling.)

- 27 -

It is evident for all regions (this applies the least to Africa) that the monthly percent
variation in the exchange rate has typically been kept to a minimum—there is a great deal of
smoothing of exchange rate fluctuations in all regions when compared to the usual monthly
variations of the committed floaters. The smoothing is most evident in Asia where the index
hovers around 90 percent for most of the period, versus 60-70 percent for the floaters.
Hence, over time, the nature of the classification problem has evolved from labeling
something as a peg when it is not, to labeling something as floating when the degree of
exchange rate flexibility has in fact been very limited.
5. Reflections on the choice of nominal anchor
The data set underlying our analysis offers a number of potential insights about how
the choice of exchange rate regime impacts on macroeconomic performance. A very basic
one is inflation. Many developing countries today are faced with the question of whether to
use the exchange rate as an explicit or implicit nominal anchor. It is widely recognized that
fixing to a strong major currency can pose problems if the developing country lags in
productivity growth, or if it experiences recessions at different times from the anchor. How
big is this problem quantitatively? It is very instructive to look at the CFA franc zone
countries in Africa, a group of more than a dozen nations that have pegged more or less
continuously to the French franc since 1946 (with the notable exception of a one time 50
percent devaluation in 1994). Although these countries have (by and large) enjoyed a
relatively high degree of exchange rate stability, they also constitute the region of the world
that has had experienced by far the most frequent bouts of deflation. During 1970 to 2001, as
shown in the top panel of Chart 8, these countries, on average had deflations (as measured by
a decline in the twelve-month percent change in the consumer price index) about 28 percent

- 28 -

of the time! This can be interpreted as “a cost” of having the exchange rate as the nominal
anchor and requiring that all adjustment in the real exchange rate to be borne by the price
level. It merits analysis to explore to what extent these prolonged bouts of deflation have
contractionary consequences for output.
Of course, the flip side having such a “tight” nominal anchor is not having a nominal
anchor at all. As shown in the bottom panel of Chart 8, freely falling is endemic—
particularly in Western Hemisphere (i.e., Latin America) and in the transition economies,
which include the republics that made up the former Soviet Union. Freely falling, as we
discuss in the next subsection, is not only problematic from the point of view of having no
price stability and the resultant high degree of uncertainty about nominal magnitudes. It is
also a main stumbling block to economic growth.
6. Does the exchange rate regime matter?
The question of whether the exchange rate arrangement matters for various facets of
economic activity is, indeed, a far-reaching and significant question that has been tackled
over the years in the literature on international trade and finance, and is beyond the scope and
aims of this paper. However, a few simple exercises are illustrative of the potential
usefulness of our Natural classification. First consider Table 7 below, the top row of which
is the same as the first four entries in Table 8 which follows. Recall that if the official regime
classification is a peg, the probability that the regime is actually “freely falling” is 28
percent. The probability that an exchange rate regime with an official classification of
independently floating is one the natural algorithm would label as freely falling is 36 percent.
Simply taking out treating dual arrangements separately drastically alters the picture. Pegs

- 29 -

with unified rates accounted for only 3 percent of freely falling, though independently
floating still accounts for 25 percent.

In a similar vein, we compare the average annual inflation rate and the average annual
per capita GDP growth rate across exchange rate regimes under (a) the standard classification
and (b) a modified standard classification that simply separates dual markets into a different
bucket. The results are shown in Table 8 for the entire sample. As Table 8 highlights, there
are significant differences in the inflation averages across the two classification schemes.
The standard classification shows very high average inflation rates in three of the four
“standard” categories; only limited flexibility exhibits moderate inflation. The difference is
particularly stark when the independently floating cases are assessed, with the standard
official classification showing average annual inflation rate of 174 percent versus 46 percent
for the classification that separates out dual rates. Similarly, annual real per capita GDP
growth is twice as large for the freely floating cases under our classification. These
discrepancies are in a large part owing to our extra category of dual rates, which houses a

- 30 -

disproportionately large number of the high inflation cases—notice the average inflation rate
for dual rates is 167 percent.

However, simply modifying the standard classification is far less revealing than the
Natural classification. The contrast is stark both in terms of the level of per capital GDP,
growth, and inflation averages; see Charts 9-12. The implications for trade volume are also
interesting. Not surprisingly, freely falling regimes (including the subcategory “hyperfloat”)
exhibit an average annual inflation rate 443 percent versus an inflation average in the 6 to15
percent range for the other categories (Chart 7). As shown in Chart 10, freely falling has the
lowest per capita income (US $3,476) of any category, while freely floating has the highest
(US $13,602)—a difference that is clouded in the original standard classification when freely
falling cases are included in the freely (independently) floating category for lack of a better
alternative. In the official IMF historical classification, limited flexibility, which was almost
entirely comprised of European countries, showed the largest per capita income.

- 31 -

Stark differences in average per capita real GDP growth also emerge. In particular,
growth is negative for freely falling, -2.5%, versus positive growth rates in the 1.6-2.4 range
for the other categories (Chart 11). Once freely falling is treated as a separate category, the
differences between our other classifications pale relative to the differences between freely
falling and not freely falling. In the standard classification, freely floating shows a meager
average growth rate of 0.5 percent for the independently floating cases. In the natural
classification, which purges the freely floating category from its freely floating counterparts,
the average growth rate quadruples for the floaters to 2.3 percent. Clearly, this exercise
highlights the importance of treating as a separate classification the freely falling episodes.
On trade volume (i.e., exports plus imports as a share of GDP), Chart 12 reveals that
for the Natural classification, the differences between fix and flex are noticeably greater than
for the official classification. Trade volume is the highest for pegs and for limited flexibility,
and it is lowest for freely floating; the gap between these is about 36 percent. Obviously, we
cannot assess causation here, but the striking differences merit further exploration.
VI. Concluding Remarks
We have argued that the official classification has serious flaws. Systems with
extensive dual or parallel markets, which accounted for about half of all exchange rate
arrangements in our sample in the 1950s and 1960s and early 1970s, are not treated as a
separate category. Most often, these regimes have been labeled pegs by all other
classifications, notably including the official classification. Given that a very significant
share of these “pegs” masked high inflation and large parallel/dual market premiums, it is
clear the standard categorization can be highly misleading. According to our new “natural”

- 32 -

classification scheme, across all countries and all months, 45 percent of all post-1970
observations officially labeled as a “peg” should, in fact, have been classified as limited
flexibility, managed or freely floating—or worse, “freely falling”. In the 1980s and 1990s, a
new type of misclassification problem emerged and the odds of being officially labeled a
“managed float” when there was a de facto peg or crawling peg was about 53 percent. We
thus find that the official history of exchange rates can be profoundly misleading, as a
striking number of pegs are much better described as floats, and vice-versa.
These misclassification problems deeply cloud our view of history along some very
basic dimensions. Using the official classification for the period 1970-2001, one would
conclude that a freely floating exchange rate is not a very attractive option—it produces an
average annual inflation rate of 174 and a paltry average per capita growth rate of 0.5
percent. This is the worst performance of any arrangement. Our classification presents a
very different picture: free floats deliver an average inflation which is less than 10 percent
(the lowest of any exchange rate arrangement), and an average per capita growth rate of 2.3
percent. We believe that the new view of exchange rate history offered here may well lead to
a significant reassessment of how different regimes perform.
In light of the dramatic revision of exchange rate classifications presented here,
Milton Friedman’s (1953) oft-ridiculed depiction of floating exchange rates no longer looks
so foolish. Friedman, of course, argued that flexible exchange rates were preferable to fixed
rates because they prevented small inflation differentials from cumulating and eventually
forcing a big devaluation. Most commentators have suggested that Friedman was completely
wrong in his prediction of how flexible rates would work, and that post-1973 flexible rates
would prove far more volatile than he had ever imagined. It is true that exchange rates across

- 33 -

the dollar, yen and DM (now euro) did become notably more volatile after the breakup of
Bretton Woods in 1971, at least in comparison with the 1960s. But for most other countries,
the main trend is that after 1973, more countries effectively adopted crawling pegs vis-à-vis
their anchor, with very little volatility – much as Friedman had envisioned. If one wants to
criticize Friedman (1953), it is perhaps better to focus on his depiction of fixed exchange
rates, which he portrayed as making occasional big moves instead of frequent small
adjustments. In practice, much de facto floating was done through the back door of parallel
markets. As a result, the effective adjustment of exchange rates under “pegging” was in many
respects far smoother than Friedman described. Indeed, for many developing countries, the
market-determined exchange rate looks remarkably similar during and after the Bretton
Woods system--they were de facto crawling pegs both before and after the break up. The
remarkable and durable popularity of crawling pegs is indeed a new fact that needs to be
better understood and rationalized. So, not only is it important to rethink the empirical
literature on exchange rate regimes, our new stylized facts make it important to rethink
theoretical comparisons of exchange rates as well.

- 39 Appendix II. The Details of the “Natural” Classification
This appendix describes in greater detail our classification algorithm, which is outlined in Section III if the
text and summarized in Figure 1 of the text. Table 4 of the text gives the different categories in our “fine” and
“coarse” grids; this appendix concentrates on the fine grid.
1. Exchange rate flexibility indices and probability analysis
Our judgment about the appropriate exchange rate classification is shaped importantly by the time-series of
several measures of exchange rate variability, based on monthly observations and averages over twenty-four month
and five-year rolling windows. The first of these is the absolute percent change in the monthly nominal exchange
rate. We prefer mean absolute deviations to variance to minimize the impact of outliers. These arise when, for
example, there are long periods in which the exchange rate is fixed but subject to periodic large devaluations. The
presence of a few outliers would imply that the variance or standard deviation would overstate the extent of
exchange rate flexibility in the period around the devaluation. 19
To assess whether exchange rates are kept within a band, we calculate the probabilities that the exchange
rate remains within a one, two, and five percent-wide band over any given period. As with the mean absolute
deviation, these probabilities are calculated over two-year and five-year rolling windows. Unless otherwise noted in
Appendix II, we use the 5-year rolling windows as our primary source in the analysis. These probabilities
supplement the analysis in an important manner. While pre-announced explicit exchange rate bands are not rare—
implicit unannounced bands are positively commonplace.
2. De jure and de facto pegs and bands: definition issues
Where the chronologies show the authorities explicitly announcing a peg, we shortcut the de facto dating
scheme described below and zero in on the date announced as the start of the peg. We then see if we can confirm
the peg by examining the mean absolute monthly change over the period following the announcement. Obviously,
the chronologies we develop, which give the day, month and year when a peg becomes operative are essential to our
algorithm. There are two cases where we need to go beyond simply verifying the announced peg. The first of these
is the case where our chronologies indicate that the pegged rate is only an official rate and that there is an active
dual market (official or illegal). As we describe in the text, essentially, we apply the same battery of tests to the
parallel market rate as we do to the official rate in a unified market. Secondly, there are the cases where policy is
announced as pegging to a basket of currencies, often without disclosing of the weights or the currencies included in
the basket. In these cases, we attempt look to see if the “basket” peg is really a de facto peg to a single dominant
currency (or to the SDR). If no dominant currency cannot be identified, we do not label the episode as a peg.20
Potentially, of course, we may be missing some de facto basket pegs, though in practice, this is almost certainly not
a major issue.
We have described our procedure for confirming de jure pegs; we now proceed to elaborate how we use
our measures of exchange rate volatility to detect de facto pegs. If authorities have not announced that their currency
is pegged, we test for a “de facto” peg in two manners: First, we examine the monthly absolute percent changes. If
the absolute monthly percent change in the exchange rate is equal to zero for four consecutive months or more, that
episode is classified (for however long its lasts) as a de facto peg if there are no dual or multiple exchange rates in
place. This allows us to identify relatively short-lived de facto pegs as well as those with a longer duration. For
instance, this exercise allowed us to identify the Philippines de facto peg to the US Dollar during 1995-1997 in the
run-up to the Asian crisis as well as the numerous European de facto pegs to the DM well ahead of the Euro.
Second, we compute the probability that the monthly exchange rate change remains within a one percent band over a
rolling 5-year period
19

This is a problem with the Levy-Sturzeneger (2002) reclassification strategy. For instance, in 1994 all CFA
Franc Zone countries are listed as managed floating. In effect, this is the result of a one-time 100% devaluation in
January of 1994.
20

Pegs to the SDR are readily verifiable so they are treated in the same manner as pegs to any other currency.

- 40 -

where ε is the monthly absolute percentage change in the exchange rate. If this probability is 80 percent or
higher, then the regime is classified as a de facto peg or crawling peg over the entire 5-year period. If the exchange
rate has no drift, it is classified as a fixed parity; if a positive drift is present, it is labeled a crawling peg; and, if the
exchange rate also goes through periods of both appreciation and depreciation it is a moving peg. Our choice of an
80 percent threshold is not accidental, but rather we chose this value because it appears to do a very good job at
detecting regimes one would want to label as pegs, without drawing in a significant number of “false positives.”
Chart A.1 plots this rolling five-year probability for the US Dollar-Yen (the dashed line), for the Bolivian
Peso-US Dollar (the dark solid line) and for the French Franc-DM rate (the pale solid line). The two vertical lines
indicate the beginning and the end of the period during which Bolivia had an annual inflation rate above 40
percent—these inflationary episodes will be dubbed freely falling.
As is evident from Chart A.1, the probability that monthly exchange rate change falls within a +/- 1% band
is far lower for the Yen-US Dollar rate than for the Bolivian peso-US Dollar rate. The period during which these
rolling probabilities were declining for the Bolivian peso-US Dollar rate corresponds to the time of Bolivia’s
hyperinflation of the mid 1980s and its immediate aftermath. The rolling probability also captures the French
Franc’s strengthening ties to the DM over the course of the sample.
Our approach regarding pre-announced and de facto bands follows a parallel two-step process. If a band is
explicitly announced and the chronologies show a unified exchange market, we label the episode as a band unless it
had already been identified as a de facto peg by the criteria described earlier. But we also verify whether the
announced and de facto bands coincide. There are several cases where the announced (de jure) band is much wider
than the de facto band.21 Thus, as before, we calculate the probability that the monthly exchange rate change
remains within a +/-2 % band over a rolling 5-year period. If this probability is 80 percent or higher, then the
regime is classified as a de facto narrow band, narrow crawling or moving band over the period through which it
remains continuously above the 80 percent threshold.
Figure A.2 plots the probability that the monthly percent change in the exchange rate will be within a +/2% band for the same three bilateral exchange rates as before. The contrast between the behavior of the Dollar-Yen
rate with the other two bilateral rates is now even more stark—as in both the case of the Bolivian Peso-Dollar rate
and the French Franc-DM 100 percent of the observations fall within a +/-2% band through most of the 1990s. For
the Dollar-Yen only between 45 and 60 percent of the observations fall in this narrow band.

21

Mexico’s exchange rate policy prior to the December 1994 crisis is one of numerous examples, despite the fact
that the band was widening over time, as the floor of the band was fixed and the ceiling was crawling, the peso
remained virtually pegged to the US dollar for extended periods of time.

In the case where the pre-announced bands are wide we also verify +/-5% bands. The specifics for each
case are discussed in Appendix III. For instance in the case of Chile we found that the de facto band during 19921998 was narrower (+/-5%) than that which was announced (+/-10% and +/-12.5%). In the case of Libya, which
had an announced a 77% wide band along a fixed central parity pegged to the SDR over the March 1986-December
2001, we were able to detect a +/-5% crawling band to the US Dollar. 22
3. The essential distinction between freely falling and freely floating
As we emphasize in the text, there are situations, almost invariably due to high inflation, in which large
downward shifts in the exchange rate occur on a routine basis for extended periods of time. Given the many wellknown problems that high inflation can cause, we believe that it is inappropriate and misleading to lump these cases
in with other floating rate regimes – even though that is essentially what all previous classifications algorithms have
done.23 A more apt characterization would be to label episodes as freely falling.24 To identify the freely falling
episodes we rely on two criteria: First, periods where the 12-month rate of inflation equals or exceeds 40 percent are
classified as freely falling unless they have been identified as some form of pre-announced peg or pre-announced
narrow band by the above criteria.25 The 40 percent inflation threshold is not entirely arbitrary, as it has been

22

Though we incorporate these wider band regimes, narrow +/-2% crawling bands are the most common. Again,
our chronologies are absolutely essential to detecting these subtleties.
23

As we shall see, many of our freely falling regimes are labeled as peg in the official and other classifications,
because these earlier efforts did not employ data on parallel or dual markets.

24

Our classification scheme is the first to make the fundamental distinction between floats and hyperfloats (freely
falling). In previous classifications, freely falling cases are usually included in the managed or freely floating
categories in the IMF’s classification and also in the Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2000) scheme.

25

It is critical that the peg criteria supersede the inflation criteria in the classification strategy, since historically a
majority of inflation stabilization efforts have used the exchange rate as the nominal anchor and in many of these
episodes inflation rates at the outset of the peg were well above our 40 percent threshold.

- 42 identified as an important benchmark in the literature on the determinants of growth.26 In effect, as we discuss later,
the average annual inflation rate for the countries that are grouped under this category is 453 percent. Borderline
freely falling, which we do not classify as a separate regime, refers to inflation rates in the 20-39 percent range. We
note these episodes on the commentary in Appendix II. As a special sub-category of freely falling, we include those
episodes that meet Cagan’s (1956) classic definition of hyperinflation (50% or more inflation per month). We label
this subcategory as hyperfloats.
A second situation where we label an exchange rate as freely falling are the six months immediately following a
currency crisis—but only for those cases where the crisis marks a sudden transition from a fixed or quasi fixed
regime to a managed or independently floating regime.27 Such episodes are typically characterized by exchange rate
overshooting. This is another situation where a large change in the exchange rate is not obviously connected to a
deliberate intent to float the currency, rather the decline is the result of a large speculative attack. To date these
crisis episodes we follow a variant of the approach suggested by Frankel and Rose (1996). Namely, any month
where the depreciation exceeds or equals twelve and one-half percent and also exceeds the preceding month’s
depreciation by at least 10 percent is identified as a crisis.28 To make sure that this approach yields plausible crisis
dates, we supplement the analysis with our extensive country chronologies, which also shed light on balance of
payments difficulties.29 As noted, cases where a large devaluation took place but the exchange rate was re-pegged
are not included in the freely falling episodes. Again, our choice of thresholds (six months) is the one that seems to
give reasonable and robust results.
Whereas the distinction between freely floating and freely falling has not been previously made in the literature,
it is clearly essential if one wants to understand anything about exchange rate regimes. Table 3 shows the cumulative
change in the exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar from January 1970 to December 2001 for selected countries. As
there is great divergence across currencies’ in their capacity to retain value vis-à-vis the US dollar, the figures shown
in this Table A.1 anticipate which countries are candidates for having one or more episodes that come under the
heading of freely falling.

26

See Easterly (2001).

27

This rules out cases where there was a devaluation and a re-peg and cases where the large exchange rate swing
occurred in the context of an already floating rate.

28

Frankel and Rose (1996) do not date the specific month of the crisis but the year and the F-R criteria calls for a
twenty-five (or higher) depreciation over the year.

29

For instance, the Thai crisis of July 1997 does not meet the modified Frankel-Rose criteria. While the
depreciation in July exceeded that of the preceding month by more than 10 percent, the depreciation of the Thai
Baht in that month did not exceed 25 percent. For these cases, we rely on the chronologies of events.

Versus the DM.
Notes: A negative entry denotes an appreciation.
Since, as a rule, freely falling is not typically an explicit arrangement of choice, our classification also provide
for all the freely falling cases, the underlying de jure or de facto arrangement (for example, dual markets,
independently floating, etc.).
4. Managed and freely floating
In reality, “pure” floating exchange rates are an artifact of economics textbooks. Even in countries where
the exchange rate is not an explicit target of policy, there are typically occasional (if relatively rare) instances where
there is unilateral or coordinated intervention in the foreign exchange market. Similarly, it is hard to come up with a
pure concept of “managed floating” that translates meaningfully into practice.
Our approach here to identifying managed and freely floating episodes is basically to create these classes
out of the residual pool of episodes that, after comprehensive application of our algorithm, have not been identified
as an explicit or implicit peg or narrow band, and that are not included in the freely falling category. To proxy the
degree of exchange rate flexibility under freely floating and managed floats, we construct a composite statistic,
ε / P( ε < 1% ).
Here, the numerator is the mean absolute monthly percent change in the exchange rate over a rolling five-year
period, while the denominator flags the likelihood of small changes. For de jure or de facto pegs, this index will be
very low, while for the free falling cases it will be very large. At any rate, we only focus on this index for those
countries and periods which are candidates for freely or managed floating labels. We tabulate the frequency
distribution of our index for the currencies that are most transparently floating, these include: US Dollar/DM-Euro,
US Dollar/Yen, US Dollar/UK Pound, US Dollar/Australian Dollar, and US Dollar/New Zealand Dollar over the

- 44 post 1973 period (the exact subperiod for each currency can be ascertained from the chronologies). We have many
of these observations, as we tabulate the ratio for rolling 5-year averages for all the floaters.30 So, for example,
Brazil floated the real in January 1999—hence, we would calculate the ratio only from that date forward. If the
Brazil’s ratio falls inside the 99 percent confidence interval or is in the upper tail of the distribution of the floater’s
group, the episode is characterized as freely floating. If that ratio falls in the lower one percent tail, the null
hypothesis of freely floating is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis of managed float.
It is important to note that managed in this context does not necessarily imply active or frequent foreign
exchange market intervention—it refers to the fact that for whatever reason our composite exchange rate variability
index, ε / P( ε < 1% ), does not behave like the indices for the “clean” floaters (freely floating).
5. Dual or multiple exchange rate regimes and parallel markets
Dual rates are, possibly the most hybrid of arrangements. There are cases or periods in which the premium
is nil and stable so that the official rate is representative of the underlying monetary policy. The official rate could be
pegged, crawling or maintained within some bands, or in a few cases allowed to float. But there are countless
episodes where the divergence between the official an parallel rate is so large, that the picture is incomplete without
knowledge of what the parallel market rate is doing.
The country chronologies shown in Appendix III are critical in identifying these episodes. In the cases
where dual or multiple rates are present or parallel markets are active, we focus on the market-determined rates
instead of the official exchange rates. We subject the market-determined rate (dual, multiple or parallel) to the
battery of tests described in the preceding sections. 31 This particular category will especially re-shape how we view
the 1940s to the 1960s, where about half the cases in the sample involve dual markets. Our classification scheme
treats dual rates as a sister species, with a set of classifications parallel to those for unified rate.

30

For instance, Australia floated on December 12, 1983, so the first five-year moving average of the ratio that we
would include in the frequency distribution for the floaters would be the one ending December 1988—since that
would include only observations during the floating regime. The distribution would include all subsequent 5-year
moving averages.
31

There are a few such cases in the sample, where only government transactions take place at the official rate.
