Understanding The Black-White Test Score Gap in the First Two Years of School

ABSTRACT
In previous research, a substantial gap in test scores between White and Black students persists,
even after controlling for a wide range of observable characteristics. Using a newly available data set
(Early Childhood Longitudinal Study), we demonstrate that in stark contrast to earlier studies, the
Black-White test score gap among incoming kindergartners disappears when we control for a small
number of covariates. Over the first two years of school, however, Blacks lose substantial ground
relative to other races. There is suggestive evidence that differences in school quality may be an
important part of the explanation. None of the other hypotheses we test to explain why Blacks are losing
ground receive any empirical backing. The difference between our findings and previous research is
consistent with real gains made by recent cohorts of Blacks, although other explanations are also possible.

The Black-White test score gap is a robust empirical regularity. A simple comparison of
mean test scores typically finds Black students scoring roughly one standard deviation below
White students on standardized tests. Even after controlling for a wide range of covariates
including family structure, socio-economic status, measures of school quality, and neighborhood
characteristics, a substantial racial gap in test scores persists.1
Gaining a better understanding of the underlying causes of the test-score gap is a question
of great importance. Neal and Johnson (1996) and O’Neill (1990) find that most of the observed
Black-White wage differentials among adults disappears once lower eighth grade test scores
among Blacks are taken into account. Thus, eliminating the test-score gap that arises by the end
of junior high school may be a critical component of reducing racial wage inequality.2
A wide variety of possible explanations for the test-score gap have been put forth. These
explanations include differences in genetic make-up (Hernstein and Murray, 1984, and Jensen,
1973 and 1998), differences in family structure and poverty (Armor, 1992, Brooks-Gunn and
Duncan, 1997, Mayer, 1997, and Phillips et. al., 1998), differences in school quality (Cook and
Evans, 2000), racial bias in testing or teachers’ perceptions (Delpit, 1995, Ferguson, 1998, and
Rodgers and Spriggs, 1996), and differences in culture, socialization, or behavior (Cook and
Ludwig, 1998, Fordham and Ogbu, 1986, Fryer, 2002, and Steele and Aronson, 1998) . The

To this effect, Christopher Jenks and Meredith Phillips write “Reducing the black-white
test score gap would do more to promote racial equality than any other strategy that commands
broad political support.”
1

appropriate public policy choice (if any) to address the test-score gap depends critically on the
underlying source of the gap.
In this paper, we utilize the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort
(ECLS-K) to shed new light on the test-score gap. ECLS-K is a new data set administered by
the Department of Education. The survey covers a sample of more than 20,000 children entering
kindergarten in the fall of 1998. An enormous amount of information is gathered for each
individual including family background, school and neighborhood characteristics, teacher and
parent assessments, and test scores. The original sample of students has subsequently been reinterviewed in the spring of kindergarten and first grade.
The results we obtain using these new data are informative and in some cases quite
surprising. As in previous data sets, we observe substantial racial differences in test scores in the
raw data: Black kindergartners score on average .64 standard deviations worse than Whites. In
stark contrast to earlier studies (including those looking at kindergartners), however, after
controlling for a small number of other observable characteristics (children’s age, child’s birth
weight, a socio-economic status measure, WIC participation, mother’s age at first birth, and
number of children’s books in the home), we essentially eliminate the Black-White test score gap
in math and reading for students entering kindergarten.3 Controlling for a much larger set of
characteristics yields the same conclusion. This same set of covariates accounts for much but not
all of the Hispanic-White difference in test scores, but cannot explain the high test-scores of
Asians.

3

On a test of general knowledge, a racial test-score gap persists. On a subjective teacher
assessment of general knowledge, however, there is no difference between Blacks and Whites in
fall of kindergarten.
2

Despite the fact that we see no difference in initial test scores for observationally
equivalent Black and White children when they enter kindergarten, their paths diverge once they
are in school. Between the beginning of kindergarten and the end of first grade, Black students
lose .20 standard deviations relative to White students with similar characteristics.4 If the gap in
test scores for these children continues to grow at the same rate, by fifth grade the Black students
will be .50 standard deviations behind their White counterparts – a gap similar in magnitude to
that found in previous analyses (Jones et. al., 1982, Phillips et. al. (1998), and Phillips (2000)).
The leading explanation for the worse trajectory of Black students in our sample is that
they attend lower quality schools. When we compare the change in test scores over time for
Blacks and Whites attending the same school, Black students lose only a third as much ground as
they do relative to Whites in the overall sample. This result suggests that differences in quality
across schools attended by Whites and Blacks is likely to be an important part of the story.
Interestingly, along “traditional” dimensions of school quality (class size, teacher education,
computer:student ratio, etc.), Blacks and Whites attend schools that are similar. On a wide range
of “non-standard” school inputs (e.g., gang problems in school, percent of students on free
lunch, amount of loitering in front of school by non-students, amount of litter around the school,
whether or not students need hall passes, and PTA funding), Blacks do appear to be attending
much worse schools after controlling for individual characteristics.5 Our story is incomplete,

4

Neither Hispanics nor Asians experience this widening test score gap over time.
Indeed, Hispanic children systematically close the gap relative to Whites, presumably because
their initial scores are artificially low as a consequence of limited English proficiency among
some Hispanic parents.
5

This pattern is also consistent with self-selection of low-achieving Whites into schools
attended by Blacks. Casting doubt on this alternative explanation is the fact that Whites who go
3

however, because the observable differences across schools do little to explain the widening
Black-White gap.
We explore a range of other explanations as to why Black children are losing ground, but
find very little empirical support for these alternative theories. Black students do not appear to
suffer bigger “summer setbacks” when school is not in session. The lower trajectories of Black
students is not simply an artifact of standardized testing. Subjective teacher assessments of
student performance yield patterns similar to the test-score data. Having a Black teacher
provides no benefit to Black students compared to their White classmates, calling into question
the possible role of either overt discrimination or low expectations for Black children on the part
of White teachers. Finally, adding proxies for behavioral problems does not alter our findings.
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section II provides a brief review of the
literature. Section III describes and summarizes the data set. Section IV presents the basic
results for incoming kindergartners, demonstrating that the Black-White test score gap
disappears once other confounding factors are accounted for. Section V documents the fact that
a racial test-score gap emerges during the school-age years, and Section VI analyzes the reasons
for this divergence. Section VII concludes.

II. Background and Previous Literature
The Coleman Report (Coleman et. al. 1966) was the first national study to describe ethnic

to school with Blacks have baseline test scores upon entering kindergarten that are similar to
those who are in all-White classes (Humphreys, 1988, documents a similar finding among high
school students). When we eliminate from the sample Whites who have no Black children in
their class (more than 60 percent of all White children fall into this category), we obtain similar
results.
4

differences in academic achievement among children at various stages of schooling. It
documented that substantial differences in educational achievement between blacks and whites
not only existed at every grade level, but increased with student age. Since then, substantial
effort has been devoted to understanding what variables account for the gap, as well as how and
why the magnitude of the gap has changed over time.6 A number of stylized facts have emerged.
Socio-economic status and the effects of poverty are important factors in explaining racial
differences in educational achievement (Brooks-Gunn and Duncan 1997, Mayer 1997, BrooksGunn et. al (1994, 1995, 2000). Even after controlling for socio-economic status in conventional
regression analysis, a substantial gap still remains.

That gap has generally been declining over

time, although for high school students today, the gap is slightly larger than it was in the late
1980's (Grissmer et. al. 1998, Hedges and Nowell 1998, and Humphreys 1998). Finally, the gap
in test scores between Blacks and Whites historically emerges before children enter kindergarten
and tends to widen over time (Phillips et. al. 1998, Carneiro, Heckman, and Manoli 2002).

III. The Data
The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) is a nationally
representative sample of over 20,000 children entering kindergarten in 1998. Thus far,
information on these children has been gathered at four separate points in time. The full sample

6

In particular, Hernstein and Murray’s controversial book, The Bell Curve, published in
1994, ignited interest in the subject by arguing that genetic differences are the primary
explanation for the differences between Blacks and Whites in achievement test scores. For
excellent summaries of the book, see Heckman (1995) and Goldberg and Manski (1995).
Examples of the discussion that emerged include Devlin et. al. (1998), Fraser (1995), and
Kincheloe et. al. (1997).

was interviewed in the fall and spring of kindergarten and spring of first grade. One-fourth of
the respondents were also interviewed in the fall of first grade. The sample will eventually be
followed through fifth grade.7 Roughly 1,000 schools are included in the sample, with an
average of more than twenty children per school in the study. As a consequence, it is possible to
conduct within-school analyses.
A wide range of data is gathered on the children in the study, which is described in detail
at the ECLS website http://nces.ed.gov/ecls. We utilize just a small subset of the available
information in our baseline specifications (although we also show that similar results are
obtained in a much more fully specified model). Students who are missing data on test-scores,
race, or age are dropped from our sample.
Summary statistics for the variables we use in our core specifications are displayed by
race in Table 1, with White referring solely to non-Hispanic Whites.8 Our primary outcome
variables are math and reading standardized test scores.9 Standardized tests were administered to
7

In addition, there is an ECLS birth cohort that tracks a nationally representative sample
of over 15,000 children born in 2001 through the first grade.
8

There are also a small number of children in the data whose racial status is classified as
“other.” These include Hawaiian, mixed race, and Native American students. Such students are
included in our regressions, but not shown in the summary statistics table.
9

These tests were developed especially for the ECLS, but are based on existing
instruments including Children’s Cognitive Battery (CCB); Peabody Individual Achievement
Test-Revised (PIAT-R); Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-3 (PPVT-3); Primary Test of
Cognitive Skills (PTCS); and Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised (WJ-R).
A “general knowledge” exam was also administered. The general knowledge test is
designed to capture “children’s knowledge and understanding of the social, physical, and natural
world and their ability to draw inferences and comprehend implications.” No further
information is available on the precise content of the general knowledge exam questions or skills
tested. We limit the analysis to math and reading scores, primarily because of the comparability
of these test scores to past research in the area. In addition, there appear to be some peculiarities
in the results of the general knowledge exam. For instance, Asians score well above other
6

the full sample in the fall of kindergarten and in the spring of first grade.10 The reading test
includes questions designed to measure basic skills (print familiarity, letter recognition,
beginning and ending sounds, rhyming sounds, and word recognition), vocabulary and
comprehension, listening and reading comprehension, knowledge of the alphabet, phonetics, etc.
The math test evaluates number recognition, counting, comparing and ordering numbers, solving
word problems, and interpreting picture graphs. The values reported in the table are item
response theory (IRT) scores provided in ECLS-K, which we have transformed to have mean
zero and a standard deviation of one for the overall sample on each of the tests and time
periods.11 In all instances sample weights provided in ECLS-K are used.12 White students on
average score .274 standard deviations above the mean on the math exam in the fall of
kindergarten, whereas Black students perform .364 standard deviations below the mean on that

groups on math and reading, but do extremely poorly on the general knowledge exam. Also,
Black students do extremely poorly on the general knowledge exam, even though teachers rate
them only slightly behind Whites in this area on the subjective teacher evaluations. Most of our
results also appear in the general knowledge scores, and we note the instances where differences
arise.
10

The tests were also given in the spring of kindergarten, but we limit our focus to the
endpoints of the available data. The kindergarten spring test results are in all cases consistent
with the results presented in the paper.
11

Because children were asked different questions depending on the answers they
provided to the initial questions on the test, IRT-adjusted scores are preferable to simple testscore measures reflecting the number of correct answers a child provided. For more detail on the
process used to generate the IRT scores, see chapter 3 of the ECLS-K Users Guide.
Our results are not sensitive to normalizing the IRT scores to have a zero mean and
standard deviation equal to one.
12

Because of the complex manner in which the ECLS-K sample is drawn, different
weights are suggested by the providers of the data depending upon the set of variables used. We
utilize the weights recommended for making longitudinal comparisons. None of our findings are
sensitive to other choices of weights, or not weighting at all.

test, yielding a Black-White gap of .638 standard deviations. By the spring of first grade, that
gap has increased to .728 standard deviations. The initial Black-White gap on reading is smaller
(.401 standard deviations). Like math, however, the reading gap widens substantially to .529
standard deviations by the end of first grade. It is worth noting that the Black-White gaps are
substantially smaller than those observed in earlier data sets for children of the same age. For
instance, Phillips, et. al. (1998) report a raw Black-White test score gap of over one standard
deviation in reading using the Children of the NLSY (CNLSY) and Infant Health and
Development Program (IHDP) data sets, which covers the cohorts born in the years 1980-1987
(CNLSY) and 1984-1985 (IHDP).
A second outcome measure that we analyze is subjective teacher assessments of a child’s
math and reading achievement. Teachers were asked to answer 20 questions about the child’s
academic performance, ranking them on a scale of “Not Yet” to “Proficient.” These answers
were then transformed into IRT scores. As was done with test scores, these subjective
assessments have been re-normalized to have mean zero and a standard deviation of one. The
patterns in the teacher assessments mirror those in the test-score data: Black and Hispanic
students start out substantially below Whites, and Black students lose ground over the first two
years of school, whereas Hispanics maintain their position relative to Whites. The most notable
difference between the test scores and teacher assessments is that Asian students are rated at or
below the level of White students in the fall of kindergarten on the teacher assessments, but then
gain relative to Whites over time.
The remainder of Table 1 presents summary statistics for the other variables used in the
analysis. In contrast to the test score variables, for which we have observations at multiple

8

points in time, most of the control variables are either collected only once (typically kindergarten
fall, but in some cases kindergarten spring), or exhibit little variation over time for individual
students. The most important of these covariates is a composite measure of socio-economic
status constructed by the researchers conducting the ECLS survey. The components used in the
SES measure are parental education, parental occupational status, and household income. Other
variables included as controls are gender, child’s age at the time of enrollment in kindergarten,
WIC participation (a nutrition program aimed at relatively low income mothers and children),
mother’s age at first birth, birth weight, and the number of children’s books in the home.13
There are substantial differences across races on many of these variables. Black children in the
sample are growing up under circumstances likely to be less conducive to academic achievement
than White children: lower socio-economic status, fewer children’s books in the home, etc.
Hispanics are also worse off than Whites on average. For Asians, the patterns are more mixed.
While this may seem an odd set of covariates to include, our rationale is that the results we
obtain with this small set of variables mirrors the findings when we include an exhaustive set of
over 100 controls.14 We caution against a causal interpretation of the coefficients on the
covariates, which we view as proxies for a broad set of environmental and behavioral factors. In
light of past research that has had great difficulty making the Black-White test score gap
disappear, we focus on the results from these very sparse regressions to highlight the fact that the
sharp differences between our results and earlier studies is not primarily a consequence of the
availability of better covariates in the ECLS.

We also present the results using a fuller set of controls for completeness.

IV. Estimating racial test score gaps for incoming kindergartners
Table 2 presents a series of estimates of the racial test score gap for the tests taken in the
fall of kindergarten. The specifications estimated are of the form

TESTSCOREi = RACEi’' + Xi’1 + ,i

(1)

where i indexes students. A full set of race dummies are included in the regression, with White
as the omitted category. Consequently, the coefficients on race capture the gap between the
named racial category and Whites. Our primary emphasis, is on the Black-White test score gap.
The vector of other covariates included in the specification, denoted Xi, varies across columns in
Table 2. As one moves to the right in the table, the set of covariates steadily grows. In all
instances, the estimation is done using weighted least squares, with weights corresponding to the
sampling weights provided in the data set.
The first and sixth columns of Table 2 presents the differences in means, not including
any covariates. These results simply reflect the raw test score gaps reported in Table 1. The
next specification adds the composite indicator of socio-economic status constructed by the
ECLS survey administrators. Socio-economic status is an important predictor of incoming test
scores, carrying a t-statistic over forty. A one-standard deviation increase in the SES variable is
associated with a .41 increase in both math and reading test scores. Controlling for socioeconomic status substantially reduces the estimated racial gaps in test scores (see also Coley
2002). The Black-White gap in math falls by more than forty percent; the reading gap is reduced
by more than two-thirds. The changes in the other race coefficients are not as large, but in every

10

instance the estimated gaps shrink, and R-squared increases substantially.
The next set of specifications adds the number of children’s books in the child’s home,
the square of that variable, and an indicator variable equal to one if the number of books takes on
a missing value for that student. The number of books is strongly positively associated with high
kindergarten test scores on both math and reading.15 Evaluated at the mean, a one-standard
deviation increase in the number of books (from 72 to 137) is associated with an increase of .143
(.115) in math and reading respectively. This variable seems to serve as a useful proxy for
capturing the conduciveness of the home environment to academic success. Including number of
books reduces the Black-White gap on math to less than one-fourth of a standard deviation and
completely eliminates the gap in reading. The gap for Hispanics also shrinks. The Asian-White
gap, however, becomes even larger than the raw gap when number of books is added to the
regression.
Columns 4 and 9 add controls for gender, age, birth weight, indicator variables for having
a mother whose first birth came when she was a teenager or over 30 (the omitted category is
having a first birth in one’s twenties), and WIC participation. These covariates generally enter
with the expected sign. Older children, those with higher birth weights, those with older
mother’s at the time of first birth all score better. Children on WIC do worse on the tests,
suggesting that this variable is not capturing any real benefits the program might provide, but
rather, the fact that eligibility for WIC is a proxy for growing up poor that the SES variable is not
adequately capturing. Adding these variables to the specification further improves the test scores

15

The marginal benefit associated with one additional book decreases as more books are
added. Beyond roughly 150 books, the marginal impact turns negative. Only 16 percent of the
sample lies above this cutoff point.
11

of Blacks and Hispanics. In fact, the estimates suggest that, controlling for other factors, Black
children actually score slightly better than Whites in reading, and only slightly worse in math.
Only a small gap persists for Hispanics. The advantage enjoyed by Asians becomes even
greater. R-squared increases substantially relative to the previous specification.
The fact that the Black-White test score gap essentially disappears with the inclusion of
sufficient controls in Table 2 is a very striking result, given that in past research a substantial gap
has persisted, regardless of the covariates included.16 For example, Hernstein and Murray (1994)
reduce the gap by one-third, Neal and Johnson (1996) reduce the gap by sixty percent, and
Phillips et. al., (1998) reduce the black-white gap by two thirds.17 Indeed, despite the fact that
Phillips et. al. (1998) have the greatest success in explaining the racial differences in reading
achievement, the residual gap is almost as large as the raw gap in our data. There is little reason
to believe that it is the precise set of covariates available in the ECLS that accounts for our
ability to eliminate the gap. For example, just accounting for socio-economic status at
kindergarten entry, we estimate the Black-White gap in reading as -.134 compared to -.67 in
Phillips et. al. (1998). Rather, it appears either that the Blacks we examine made real gains

16

On the test of general knowledge, the Black-White gap does not fully disappear.
Black students test almost one-full standard deviation behind Whites in a raw comparison of
means. That gap falls to .3 when controls are included. On the subjective teacher assessments,
the raw gap in general knowledge between Blacks and Whites is much smaller (.25 standard
deviations) and does shrink almost to zero with the inclusion of controls.
17

The two exceptions we are aware of in which the Black-White test score gap has been
made to disappear are Li and Poirier (2002) and Carneiro, Heckman, and Manoli (2002). Li and
Poirier (2002), using a Bayesian structural model, find no systematic differences between Blacks
and Whites using the NLSY. Hernstein and Murray (1994) and Phillips et. al., (1998), using
different methods on the same data, find large gaps still persists. Using Children of the NLSY,
Carneiro, Heckman, and Manoli (2002) find that on some tests, racial gaps disappear with
controls, although large gaps remain on other tests designed to capture similar sets of skills.
12

relative to Whites, or alternatively, non-random selection into earlier data sets led to exaggerated
estimates of the racial gap in earlier studies.18
The final specifications in Table 2 (columns 5 and 10) include an exhaustive set of
roughly100 covariates capturing city size, neighborhood characteristics, region of the country,
parental education, parental income, parental occupational status, family size and structure,
whether the mother worked, type of pre-school program participation, whether English is spoken
at home, and the extent of parental involvement in a child’s life and school. We report only a
subset of the covariates in Table 2; full results are presented in Appendix Table 1. Almost all of
the controls enter in the predicted direction and with coefficients of plausible magnitude.
Interestingly, none of the coefficients on race change appreciably. Only a few of the parameters
on the controls included in the parsimonious specifications are greatly affected either, and these
are easily explained. The socio-economic status coefficient shrinks because the full set of
covariates includes variables that go into the construction of the composite indicator such as
parent’s income and occupational status. The coefficient on age becomes highly negative
because an age squared term (which is positive and significant) is included in the full
specification. The inclusion of these additional variables does little to improve the fit of the
model.
Table 3 explores the sensitivity of the estimated racial gaps in test scores across a wide
variety of alternative specifications and sub-samples of the data. We report only the race

18

When we limit our data set to groups that previous data sets over-sampled (low birthweight babies in the case of IHDP or children born to teen mothers in CNLSY), however, our
results are virtually unchanged, adding credence to the argument that Blacks have made real
gains.
13

coefficients and associated standard errors in the table. The top row of the table presents the
baseline results using a full sample and our parsimonious set of controls (corresponding to
columns 4 and 9 of Table 2). Weighting all of the observations equally in the regressions leaves
the Black-White gap in math and reading remain virtually unchanged. Employing an alternative
test-score measure (T-scores, which are norm-referenced measurements of achievement) has
very little impact on the results.
One might be concerned that restricting all the coefficient estimates to be identical
across the entire sample may yield misleading results. Regressions on a common support (e.g.
only on single mothers, or only in rural areas) provide one means of addressing this concern.
Almost every subset of the data examined yields results roughly similar to those for the overall
sample. There is some slight evidence that Black females do better relative to Whites than do
Black males. The results appear to be quite consistent across quintiles of the socio-economic
status distribution. Due in part to relatively imprecise estimates, the equality of Black and White
test scores on math and reading tests can rarely be rejected for any of the quintiles. Rural Blacks
do somewhat worse relative to whites than those in central cities. Blacks in private schools
appear to do especially well, consistent with Neal (1997) and Grogger and Neal (2000).19
The results presented in Tables 2 and 3 maintain the assumption that children of different
races are equally responsive to changes in covariates. Cross-race differences in coefficients are

19

We have also experimented with limiting the sample to the set of children for whom
there is substantial overlap across races in background characteristics. More specifically, we ran
probits with an indicator variable for Black as the dependent variable and the full set of
covariates as predictors. When we drop from the sample the roughly 30 percent of students
whose predicted probability of being Black is less than 10 percent or greater than 90 percent, the
Black-White gap on math rises slightly and the reading gap becomes closer to zero.
14

potentially important because they affect the interpretation of the racial test score gap estimates
in the preceding tables. Black children experience worse environments on average. If Black
children do not derive as much benefit from improvements in socio-economic status, number of
children’s books, higher birth weight, etc., then our earlier results will overstate the convergence
in Black-White test scores.
Table 4 presents within-race estimates of our basic specifications to determine how large
this bias may be. Columns 1 and 6 replicate the coefficient estimates from the full sample. The
remaining columns present results within a specific race category. The Black children in our
sample are less responsive to changes in socio-economic status than Whites: a one-standard
deviation improvement in socio-economic status for a Black child is associated with a .176
standard deviation increase in math scores, compared to .316 for a White child. For most of the
other covariates, however, the White and Black coefficients are similar. Using the coefficients
in columns 3 and 8, a Black child that had the characteristics of the average White child in the
sample would be estimated to score -.21 standard deviations below that White child on math and
be almost exactly even in reading.20 Thus, to the extent that public policies are designed to
improve the environments experienced by Black children, our baseline estimates may slightly
overstate the ground that would be gained by Blacks. This logic also holds for Hispanics, but
not for Asians, who seem to be more responsive to environmental influences.

20

Using the coefficients in columns 2 and 7, a White student that had the characteristics
of the average Black child would be expected to score .07 (.13) standard deviations above
(below) that average Black child on math (reading) respectively. These results are almost
identical to the predictions from our baseline specification, because the coefficients from the
White regression are quite similar to those from the full sample.
15

V. The evolution of the racial test score gaps as children age
The results of the previous section demonstrate that although Black test scores lag Whites
by a large margin, the inclusion of a small number of covariates eliminates any systematic
differences in the math and reading performances of Whites and Blacks entering kindergarten.
Hispanics somewhat lag Whites, and Asians exceed all of the other races. In this section, we
explore how those racial gaps change over time.
In terms of raw test scores, simple calculations based on the numbers in Table 1 show
that Black students lose some ground relative to Whites between the fall of kindergarten and the
spring of first grade: .090 standard deviations on math and .128 standard deviations on reading.
Table 5 presents regression results for those two time periods We report results only from our
“parsimonious” regression specification; similar racial gaps emerge when the exhaustive set of
covariates is included. Controlling for other factors in the regressions, Black students appear to
lose much more ground than they do in the raw means: -.156 standard deviations on math and .188 standard deviations on reading.21 If Black students in the sample continue to lose ground
through ninth grade at the rate experienced in the first two years of school, they will lag White
students on average by a full standard deviation in raw math and reading scores and over twothirds of a standard deviation in math even after controlling for observable characteristics
(substantially smaller for reading). Raw gaps of that magnitude would be similar to those found
in previous studies of high-school age children (Grissmer, Flanagan, and Williamson 1998,

21

Similar results (not shown in the table) are obtained when we include the full set of
nearly 100 covariates. In those specifications, Black students lose .136 standard deviations on
math and .109 standard deviations on reading. Including the fall kindergarten test score as a
covariate predicting the spring first grade test score also has little impact on the results: Black
students lose .192 (.140) standard deviations in math (reading).
16

Hedges and Nowell 1998, Humphreys 1988, Phillips et. al., 1998, and Phillips, 2000).
In striking contrast to the Black-White gap, Hispanics show gains relative to Whites
between the beginning of kindergarten and the end of first grade. Asians lose roughly as much
ground as Blacks on math (although they start ahead of Whites) and also fall slightly on reading.
Thus, Black students are not only losing ground relative to Whites, but even more so relative to
Hispanics, and somewhat less compared to Asians.

VI. Why are Black students losing ground in the first two years of school?
Understanding why Black students fare worse in the first two years of school, is a
question of paramount importance for two reasons. First, knowing the source of the divergence
may aid in developing public policies to alleviate the problem. Second, determining the
explanation for the widening gap will help to determine whether the simple linear extrapolation
over the academic career is a plausible conjecture.
There are a number of plausible explanations as to why the racial gap in test scores grows
as children age: (1) Black children attend lower quality schools on average, (2) the importance of
parental/environmental contributions may grow over time. Since Black children are on average
disadvantaged in this regard, they fall behind, (3) because of worse home and neighborhood
environments, Black students suffer worse “summer setbacks” when school is not in session, (4)
the results are an artifact of the particular standardized tests used/poor measurement of a child’s
environment, rather than representing true losses, (5) something about the interaction between
Black students and schools interferes with the learning process. Such factors might include
discrimination/low expectations on the part of teachers toward Black students, systematic

17

differences in self-control or socialization across children of different races, etc., or (6) the fall
kindergarten test scores are measuring a different set of skills than the later tests and the gap
between Whites and Blacks is greater on the set of skills measured later. We address each of
these hypotheses in turn.
Are Black students losing ground because they attend worse schools?
There is substantial racial segregation in school attendance in the United States. In our
data which samples roughly 20 children each from approximately 1,000 schools, in 35 percent of
those schools there is not a single Black child in the sample.22 The mean Black student in our
sample attends a school that is 59 percent Black and 8 percent Hispanic. In contrast, the typical
White student goes to a school that is only 6 percent Black and 5 percent Hispanic. Given that
the overlap in schools attended by Blacks and Whites is relatively limited, one plausible
explanation for why Black students are losing ground is that they attend worse schools on
average.
Because our data set has many individuals from each school include in the sampling
frame, school-fixed effects can be included in the estimation. With school-fixed effects, the
estimated Black-White test score gap is identified off of the relative performance of Blacks and
Whites attending the same school, as opposed to across schools. To the extent that differential
average school quality across races is the complete explanation for the widening racial test score
gap, one would predict that the gap should not widen over time when comparing Blacks and
Whites attending the same school. There are, of course, thorny issues of sample selection that
potentially complicate the interpretation of these results: White students who elect to attend

22

Black students may attend these schools, but just not be in the classrooms sampled.
18

schools with Black students may have differential test score trajectories than other White
students, even if they had gone to all White schools. Nonetheless, looking within schools
provides a first attempt at testing this hypothesis.
The comparison of changes in the Black-White test score gap over time including and
excluding school-fixed effects is presented in Table 6. All of the specifications in the table
include the parsimonious set of covariates, although only the coefficient on the Black-White gap
is shown in the table. The first three columns reflect the full sample of students. The remaining
columns restrict the sample to schools that have both Black and White children in our sample.
This set of students is relevant because only mixed-race schools provide useful variation to
identify the racial test score gap when school-fixed effects are included.
Column 3 of the table shows the baseline results reflecting the fact that Blacks are losing
ground in the full sample (-.156 standard deviations relative to Whites in math, -.188 standard
deviations in reading). When we eliminate students attending all-White schools from the
sample, but otherwise estimate identical specifications, the results are not greatly affected.
Blacks continue to lose substantial ground by the end of first grade. When school-fixed effects
are included in the regression (columns 7-9), the Black-White test-score gap is identified off of
differences between Blacks and Whites attending the same school. The estimates of ground lost
by Blacks shrinks to less than one-third of the magnitude in the full sample, and is not
statistically different from zero in these specifications.23

23

This finding in some ways parallels Currie and Thomas’s (1995) finding that students
early gains for students who attend Head Start tend to disappear due to low quality schools that
these students later attend. In our data, however, there is no positive effect of Head Start on
student test scores even in kindergarten, once other factors are controlled for.
19

These findings are consistent with – but not definitive proof of – the argument that
systematic differences in school quality for Blacks and Whites may explain the divergence in test
scores. An alternative explanation is that Whites who choose to attend schools with Blacks are
systematically worse than other Whites. Note, however, that a comparison of columns 1 and 4
show that in the fall of kindergarten Black students actually fare somewhat worse relative to
Whites who attend schools with Blacks then they do with the full sample of Whites. This finding
suggests that the Whites who go to school with Blacks (controlling for observables) actually
achieve at a slightly higher level than do those who attend all-White schools, which is consistent
with previous research. Moreover, comparing columns 4 and 7, in kindergarten fall, Blacks do
even worse relative to Whites attending the same school than they do compared to other Whites.
Thus, a simple selection story in which low-achieving Whites are more likely to go to school
with Blacks is not consistent with the data. On the other hand, we cannot rule out a priori the
possibility that Whites who attend school with Blacks are on lower academic trajectories, despite
the fact that they initially score better on tests than other Whites.
If Blacks attend worse schools than Whites on average, one might expect that this would
be reflected in observable characteristics of the schools. Table 7 analyzes this issue. Each row
of the table corresponds to a different measure of school quality. Column 1 presents means and
standard deviations of each variable in the data. Columns 2-5 report the race coefficients from
regressions that are parallel to those elsewhere in the paper, except that school inputs are the
dependent variable rather than test scores. Thus, the entries in columns 2-5 reflect the extent to
which children of other races attend higher or lower quality schools on each of the measures,
controlling for our “parsimonious” set of covariates. On traditional measures of school quality

20

such as class size, teacher’s education, computers in class, and internet connections, differences
between blacks and whites are small. On the other hand, the percentage of students eligible for
free lunch, the degree of gang problems in school, the amount of loitering in front of the school
by non-students, and the amount of litter around the schools are much higher for blacks.
There are a number of important weaknesses in the argument that differential school
quality explains the divergent trajectories of Whites and Blacks. First, the observable measures
of school inputs included in Table 7 explain only a small fraction of the variation in student
outcomes. For instance, adding the school input measures to our basic student-level test-score
regressions only increases the R-squared of the regression by .05. Second, even after the school
input measures are added to the test-score regressions, the gap between Blacks and Whites
continues to widen. Thus, these particular school inputs are not adequately capturing the critical
differences across schools. Finally, on the measured school inputs, both Hispanics and Asians
also experience worse schools than Whites, but neither of those groups is losing ground. Because
of these important weaknesses in the story, the evidence linking school quality differences to the
poor trajectories of Blacks can be characterized as no more than suggestive.
Does the importance of parental/environmental inputs grow as children age?
Black children tend to grow up in environments less conducive to high educational
attainment. If the importance of parental/environmental inputs grows as children age, Black
students would be expected to lose ground relative to Whites. The evidence in Table 5,
however, argues just the opposite. If that were true, than one would expect to observe the raw
gaps widening between Blacks and Whites, but to the extent our control variables adequately
capture a child’s environment, the residual gap after including all the covariates would remain

21

constant. In fact, however, the residual gap increases more than the raw gap contradicting this
explanation.24 Also, the magnitude of the coefficients on socio-economic status, age at
kindergarten entry, and mother’s age at first birth are smaller in the first-grade test-score
regressions. That suggests that the relative importance of non-school factors decreases over
time, presumably because schools become a critical input into educational gains once children
enter school.25
Do Black children suffer worse summer setbacks when school is not in session?
Entwisle and Alexander (1992 and 1994) and Heyns (1978), have argued that Black
students lose more ground over the summer than White students as a consequence of worse
home and neighborhood environments, and they gain ground over the school year while in
school. If this were the explanation for the falling performance of Blacks, then public policies
should be aimed not at schools, but rather, summer interventions. Our data provides a unique
opportunity to test this hypothesis because a subset of the sample is tested both in the spring of
kindergarten and in the fall of first grade, shortly after students return to class, allowing us to
isolate the relative summer setbacks for Blacks and Whites. The results are reported in Table 8.

24

Indeed, from a theoretical perspective, one might expect that the opposite hypothesis
would hold true: the importance of parental inputs declines with age. Prior to reaching school
age, the relative share of educational inputs provided by parents is very large. Once school
starts, much of the burden for educating is shifted to the schools. Our empirical evidence does
not, however, provide much support for this conjecture either.
25

An alternative explanation for the shrinking coefficient on the SES variable is that
socio-economic status varies over time. Therefore, using the kindergarten value of the SES
variable in the first grade regression induces measurement error. That explanation cannot
explain the declining coefficients on age at school entry and mother’s age at birth. Moreover, for
other variables that are time varying, like number of books and WIC participation, the
coefficients do not shrink in the first-grade regression.
22

For the subset of the sample that is tested in the fall of first grade (about one-fourth of the
students), we report at each point in time both the raw test score gap and the residual gap
controlling for our parsimonious set of covariates. For the regression results, only the coefficient
reflecting the Black-White test score gap is shown in the table, and each entry in the table is
from a separate regression. The test score gaps in the fall of kindergarten (column 1) and spring
of first grade (column 4) for this subset of the sample are similar to those for the sample as a
whole, suggesting that the sub-sample is representative. Of greater interest is a comparison of
the test scores in the spring of kindergarten versus the fall of first grade, since most of the
intervening time was spent outside of school. On the raw scores, there is little difference before
and after the summer break; to the extent there is any gap, it favors Black students. With
controls, Black students lose slightly relative to whites over the summer on math (the gap rises
from -.097 to -.134), but the null hypothesis of no change cannot be rejected. The point
estimates for reading show slight gains by Black students relative to Whites over the summer.
Thus, the empirical results lend little support to the hypothesis that differential summer setbacks
explain the lost ground of Black students in our sample. We do observe Blacks losing ground
during the school year in both subjects in both years, in direct conflict with Entwisle and
Alexander (1992).
Are the results simply an artifact of standardized testing?
Given the potential difficulties of evaluating student achievement using standardized tests
in children so young, one possibility is that our results are simply an artifact of standardized
testing. To assess this hypothesis, we examined the relative performance of children of different
races on subject teacher evaluations. The teacher assessments were normalized to be mean zero

23

with a standard deviation equal to one. The regressions are identical to the specifications using
test scores with one important difference. Because of concerns about heterogeneity across
teachers in the way they may rate students on these subjective evaluations, we include teacherfixed effects in all of the regressions using these measures. Thus, the estimates are based on a
student’s evaluation relative to other students in the same classroom.
The results for teacher assessments are presented in Table 9. The odd columns contain
the raw gaps across races on the assessments; the even columns control for our parsimonious set
of regressors. As before, the interpretation of the coefficients is standard deviation units. In
kindergarten fall, Black students are judged by teachers to be .26 to .28 standard deviations
behind Whites on both math and reading. These gaps are smaller than those observed on the
standardized tests. Controlling for other characteristics, the Black-White gap shrinks to .103
standard deviations on math and .066 standard deviations on reading. Just as was the case with
test scores, the gap between Whites and Blacks widens substantially by the end of first grade.
Thus, the patterns in the test scores are replicated in teacher assessments. This is true not only
for Blacks, but also for Hispanics and Asians. The most notable divergence in results between
test scores and teacher assessments is that teachers initially rate Asians as performing no better
than Whites, but increase their evaluation of Asians over time. In the test score data, the
opposite pattern emerges.
Can teacher bias or differential socialization explain Black students losing ground?
If, as some have argued, White teachers have lower expectations for Black children or
otherwise discriminate against them in the classroom (Baron, Tom, and Cooper 1985, Dusek,
1975, Ferguson 1998, and Lightfoot 1978), then one would predict that Black students with

24

White teachers should lose more ground than Black students with Black teachers. Table 10 tests
this theory. Columns 1 and 2 correspond to the sub-sample of students neither of whose teachers
in kindergarten or first grade are Black. Columns 3 and 4 reflect students who have at least one
Black teacher. Note that less than five percent of White students have a Black teacher by the end
of first grade, compared to over fifty percent of Black students. The top rows of the table report
test scores without teacher-fixed effects, the middle panel reports test scores including teacherfixed effects, and the bottom panel reports subjective teacher assessments (with teacher-fixed
effects). The results are generally similar across the three sets of analysis. Black children who
have at least one Black teacher start out somewhat worse relative to their White peers on math
and slightly better on reading, relative to Black students who have two Black teachers. By the
end of first grade, however, the Black-White test score gap is greater across the board for
students who have at least one Black teacher (i.e., the coefficients in column 4 are always more
negative than those in column 2). This finding is exactly the opposite of what one would predict
from a discrimination story.
Although not shown in tabular form, we have also explored whether differences in
socialization and behavior might explain the results. The data set includes a number of
variables that might be correlated with cultural differences in socialization. Parents and teachers
were asked to rate the child on various social skills including: self control, approaches to
learning, interpersonal skills, and exhibiting problem behaviors. The inclusion of these variables
in our regressions, however, had virtually no impact on the measured Black-White test score gap

25

or it’s trajectory over time.26
Does the material tested change as children age in a manner that lowers the relative
performance of Black students?
In personal correspondence, ECLS reports that the fraction of the exam devoted to each
set of skills remains constant as children age. In the fall of kindergarten, few children are
expected to correctly answer questions involving multiplication and division, and by the spring
of first grade, few children are expected to miss questions involving counting. Nonetheless, the
same mix of questions is asked.
Still, it is potentially interesting to compare the relative performance of Black and White
children on the different types of questions over time. Table 11 reports the Black-White gap on
questions assessing specific sets of skills at both the beginning and the end of the sample. The
estimates in the table are based on specifications including our parsimonious set of regressors,
and the magnitude of the estimates is once again interpretable as standard deviation units. In
math, the lost ground on the part of Blacks is attributable almost solely to poor performance on
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Black students perform almost as well as
Whites in the fall of kindergarten on these tasks, but lag Whites by over two-tenths of a standard
deviation by the spring of first grade. To the extent that skill in manipulating numbers is likely
to be a more important input into understanding higher-order math than are simple tasks such as
counting or evaluating relative size, these results may foreshadow continued losses for Blacks
relative to Whites in math as they age. Blacks lose roughly equal ground on all aspects of

26

Although we do not directly test other social theoretic explanations such as “stereotype
threat” and “acting white,” it would seem unlikely that they would affect children at such an
early age.
26

reading proficiency.

VII. Conclusion
Previous efforts to explain the Black-White test score gap have generally fallen short – a
substantial residual remained for Black students, even after controlling for a full set of available
covariates. Using a new data set, we demonstrate that among entering kindergartners, the BlackWhite gap in test scores can be essentially eliminated by controlling for just a small number of
observable characteristics of the children and their environment. Once students enter school, the
gap between White and Black children grows, even conditional on observable factors. We test a
number of possible explanations for why Blacks lose ground. The only hypothesis which
receives any support is that Black students attend worse schools on average.
Compared to previous studies, our results provide reason for optimism. Research on
earlier cohorts of children found much greater Black-White test score gaps, both in the raw
scores and controlling for observables. When we attempt to mimic the non-random sample
frames in earlier research (for example only looking at low-birth weight babies as in IHDP), we
continue to find much smaller gaps in our sample. One plausible explanation for the differences
between the current sample and cohorts attending kindergarten 10-30 years ago is that the
current cohort of Blacks has made real gains relative to Whites. Reconciling our results with
past studies represents an important direction for future research.

Notes: The values in the tables are means and standard deviations of student-level data for those students

normalized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one in the full, unweighted sample.
Subjective teacher assessments have also been normalized in this manner. The category White includes
only non-Hispanic Whites. Precise definitions of the variables are provided in the data appendix. The
SES composite measure incorporates information on parental education, occupational status, and family
income. The SES measure ranges from -4.75 to 2.75 in the sample, with higher numbers indicating
higher socio-economic status. The total number of students in the sample who receive a positive weight in
the estimation is 13,290. The bottom panel of the table reports the frequency of missing values for the
covariates. In all cases, sample weights provided with ECLS are used in the calculations.

Notes: The Dependent variable is the math or reading test score in the fall of kindergarten. Test scores are IRT scores, normalized to have a mean
of zero and a standard deviation of one in the full, unweighted sample. Non-Hispanic Whites are the omitted race category, so all of the race
coefficients are gaps relative to that group. The unit of observation is a student. Standard errors in parentheses. Estimation is done using
weighted least squares, using sample weights provided in the data set. In addition to the variables included in the table, indicator variables for
students with missing values on each covariate are also included in the regressions. In addition, columns 5 and 10 report only a subset of the
coefficients from regressions with 98 covariates included in the specification. The full results for columns 5 and 10 are reported in appendix table
A-1. Note that the specifications in columns 5 and 10 include age and age squared; that is why the coefficient on age changes so dramatically
relative to other columns in the table.

coefficients are reported in this table. The top row of the table simply reproduces the baseline results in columns
4 and 9 of Table 2. The remaining rows of the table correspond to different weights, test score measures, or
particular subsets of the data. For further details of the baseline specification, see the notes to Table 2.

Notes: The dependent variable is the math or reading test score in the fall of kindergarten. The first and sixth columns simply replicate our

baseline results from columns 4 and 9 of Table 2. The other columns report coefficient estimates from specifications identical to that of the
baseline, but estimated separately by race of the student. There is no within-race variation in the race variables, so these variables are omitted from
the within-race regressions. See the notes to Table 2 for further details of the estimation.

Notes: The dependent variable is fall kindergarten test scores in columns 1 and 3 and spring first grade test scores in columns 2 and 4. All
specifications include the parsimonious set of controls corresponding to columns 4 and 9 of Table 2. Test scores are IRT scores, normalized to
have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one in the full, unweighted sample. Non-Hispanic Whites are the omitted race category, so all of
the race coefficients are gaps relative to that group. The unit of observation is a student. Standard errors in parentheses. Estimation is done using
weighted least squares, using sample weights provided in the data set. In addition to the variables included in the table, indicator variables for
students with missing values on each covariate are also included in the regressions.

Notes: Entries in the table are estimates of the Black-White test score gap, controlling for the parsimonious set of regressors. Columns 3, 6, and 9
represent the estimated change in the gap between kindergarten fall and first grade spring. The first three columns include all students. The
remaining columns restrict the data set to schools that had students of different races included in the ECLS-K sample. The final three columns
include school-fixed effects. Estimation is done using weighted least squares, using sample weights provided in the data set.

Notes: The values in the first column of the table are the means and standard deviations of the named school input. The entries in the remaining
columns are estimated coefficients on race (with non-Hispanic Whites as the omitted categories) from regressions of the named school inputs on
the race dummies and other covariates included in the parsimonious set of controls. The method of estimation is weighted least squares using
sample weights provided by ECLS. The reported standard errors have been corrected to take into account within-school correlation in the schoollevel measures.

Only a small fraction of the sample was tested in Fall of first grade. The total number of observations in the sub-sample is 5,223. The top panel of
the table reflects raw test score gaps; the bottom panel is the residual test score gap, controlling for the parsimonious set of control variables. The
observations demarcated by the heavy border represent the tests given shortly before and shortly after summer break. Standard errors are in
parentheses.

Notes: The table entries are estimated racial gaps in subjective teacher assessments of student achievement provided by teachers in kindergarten
fall and first-grade spring. The odd columns are raw gaps; the even columns are residual gaps after controlling for the parsimonious set of controls
and teacher-fixed effects. Teacher-fixed effects are included in the regressions due to concerns over comparability across teachers in these
assessments. Teacher assessments are normalized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one in the full, unweighted sample. The
method of estimation is weighted least squares using sample weights provided by ECLS. Columns 2, 4, and 6 of each row are coefficients from
one regression. The number of observations is 8,633 for math and 10,839 for reading.

Notes: The values in the table are estimated Black-White test score gaps in the top two panels and subjective teacher assessments in the third
panel. Students in the data set are assigned to two mutually exclusive groups in this table: students who do/do not have any Black teachers in
kindergarten or first grade. The number of observations falling into each of those categories, by race of the student, is reported at the bottom of
the table. The top panel of the table reports results from regressions including the parsimonious set of controls. The second panel adds teacherfixed effects. The bottom panel is teacher assessments, controlling for teacher-fixed effects.

Notes: Entries in the table are residual Black-White test score gaps on specific types of questions in kindergarten fall and first-grade spring. On
each category of question, student scores have been normalized to have a mean of zero and standard deviation equal to one in the full, unweighted
sample. The parsimonious set of controls is included in all regressions. The method of estimation is weighted least squares using sample weights
provided by ECLS. The number of observations on reading is 13,290 and on math is 12,601.

Data Appendix
The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) is a nationally
representative sample of 21,260 children entering kindergarten in 1998. Thus far, information
on these children has been gathered at four separate points in time. The full sample was
interviewed in the fall and spring of kindergarten and spring of first grade. All of our
regressions and summary statistics are weighted, unless otherwise noted, and we include
dummies for missing data. We describe below how we combined and recoded some of the ECLS
variables used in our analysis.
Socio-economic Composite Measure.
The socioeconomic scale variable (SES) was computed at the household level for the set of
parents who completed the parent interview in Fall Kindergarten or Spring Kindergarten. The
SES variable reflects the socioeconomic status of the household at the time of data collection for
spring kindergarten. The components used for the creation of SES were: Father/male guardian’s
education; Mother/female guardian’s education; Father/male guardian’s occupation;
Mother/female guardian’s occupation; and Household income.
Number of Children’s Books.
Parents/guardians were asked “ How many books does your child have in your home now,
including library books?” Answers ranged from 0 to 200.
Child’s Age.
We used the Child’s Age at Assessment Composite variable provided by ECLS. The Child’s age
was calculated by determining the number of days between the child assessment date and the
child’s date of birth. The value was then divided by 30 to calculate the age in months.

Birth Weight.

Parent’s were asked how much their child weighed when they were born. We multiplied the
pounds by 16 (and added it to the ounces) to calculate birth weight in ounces.
Mother’s Age at First Birth.
Mothers were asked how old they were at the birth of their first child.
Average Class Size.
We computed each child’s average class size over their kindergarten year by adding their class
size in the fall and spring and dividing by two.
Teacher Has Master’s Degree.
We coded a dummy variable equal to one if the child’s teacher has a master’s degree or above.
Computer-Student Ratio.
The number of computers in each school and the total enrollment of each kindergarten program
is provided by the ECLS based on a survey given to each school. We divided the number of
computers in each school by the total enrollment in kindergarten to produce this ratio.
Internet Hook-Up Student Ratio.
This was constructed similar to the Computer:Student ratio, except the numerator consists of
internet/LAN connections in the school.
Percent of Students in Child’s School Available for Free Lunch.
Schools provided the percent of students in their school who were eligible for free lunch.
Gang Problems.
Schools were asked “how much of a problem are gangs in the neighborhood where the school is
located?” We coded this variable so that 1 implies “no problem”, 2 implies “somewhat of a
problem” and 3 implies “big problem.”
Teacher Turnover.
Schools were asked how much they agreed with the statement “teacher turnover is a problem in

this school.” Answers range from 0-5, 0 indicating they strongly disagree and 5 indicating they
strongly agree.
Litter Around School.
The ECLS interviewer was asked to report the amount of litter around each school. The variable
ranges from 0 to 3. 0 indicates no litter and 3 indicates “a lot.”
People Loitering Around School
The ECLS interviewer was asked to report the amount of loitering by non-students around the
school. The variable ranges from 0 to 3. 0 indicates no litter and 3 indicates “a lot.”
PTA Funding.
Schools reported whether or not they receive supplemental funding from their PTA. We recoded
this variable so that 1 implies yes and 0 implies no.
Hall Pass Required.
Schools were asked “are hall passes required to ensure the safety of the children in your school?”
This variable is coded 1 if yes and 0 if no.
