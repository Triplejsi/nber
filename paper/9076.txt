The Home Market Effect and Bilateral Trade Patterns

NBER Working Paper No. 9076
July 2002
JEL No. F0, F1
ABSTRACT
We test for home-market effects using a difference-in-difference gravity specification. The
home-market effect is the tendency for large countries to be net exporters of goods with high transport
costs and strong scale economies. It is predicted by models of trade based on increasing returns to scale
but not by models of trade based on comparative advantage. In our estimation approach, we select pairs
of exporting countries that belong to a common preferential trade area and examine their exports of goods
with high transport costs and strong scale economies relative to their exports of goods with low transport
costs and weak scale economies. We find that home-market effects exist and that the nature of these
effects depends on industry transport costs. For industries with very high transport costs, it is national
market size that determines national exports. For industries with moderately high transport costs, it is
neighborhood market size that matters. In this case, national market size plus market size in nearby
countries determine national exports.

1. Introduction
Much recent theoretical work in international trade is based on increasing returns
to scale of some kind. This includes models of intra-industry trade (Krugman, 1979,
1981; Helpman, 1981), multinational firms (Helpman, 1984; Markusen, 1984), and
economic geography (Krugman, 1991; Venables, 1996). These efforts have produced
compelling explanations for why similar countries may gain from trade, why most
foreign direct investment tends to flow between rich countries, and why manufacturing
activity tends to agglomerate spatially within countries.
For purposes of empirical work, however, trade theories based on increasing
returns present a problem. Their predictions for trade flows are similar to those of
models based on comparative advantage (Helpman and Krugman, 1985; Davis, 1995).
This complicates testing trade theory (Helpman, 1999) and may account for why some
attempts to estimate the importance of increasing returns for trade have yielded mixed
results (Helpman, 1987; Hummels and Levinsohn, 1995; Debaere, 2001).1
Recently, empirical researchers have begun to estimate the impact of increasing
returns on trade by exploiting home-market effects, as derived by Krugman (1980). The
home-market effect is the tendency for large countries to be net exporters of goods with
high transport costs and strong scale economies.2 In the presence of fixed costs, and thus
scale economies, firms prefer to concentrate global production of a good in a single

The observational equivalence of scale economies and comparative advantage is a problem also for
testing models of economic geography. See Ellison and Glaeser (1997) and Hanson (2001). See Evenett
and Keller (2001) for other work on trade flows, increasing returns, and comparative advantage.

There is debate about the robustness of the home market effect in Krugman (1980). Davis (1998) finds
that with one differentiated-good sector (with positive fixed costs), one homogeneous good sector (with
zero fixed costs), and identical sectoral transport costs the home-market effect disappears. Krugman and
Venables (1999) counter Davis’ result by showing that the home-market effect holds as long as some
homogenous goods have low transport costs or some differentiated goods have zero fixed costs. Holmes
and Stevens (2002) demonstrate further support for the generality of home-market effects.

location; in the presence of transport costs, it makes sense for this location to be a market
with high product demand. Goods that are subject to weak scale economies and/or low
transport costs are then produced by small economies. The home-market effect implies a
link between market size and exports that does not exist in models in which trade is based
solely on comparative advantage.
One approach to identify home-market effects uses the correlation between
industry supply and industry demand across countries or regions. In Krugman (1980),
the demand for individual goods varies across markets because of differences in
consumer preferences (e.g., German consumers prefer beer, French consumers prefer
wine), leading production of a good to concentrate in markets with high levels of
demand. Davis and Weinstein (1999, 2002) find that, for manufacturing industries in
either OECD countries or Japanese regions, industry production increases more than onefor-one with local demand for a good. Head and Ries (2001) find evidence of similar
patterns of industry production and consumption in Canada and the United States. Both
sets of results are interpreted as consistent with home-market effects.3
A second approach to estimate home-market effects is to examine how the income
elasticity of exports varies across goods. In theory, the income elasticity of exports
should be higher for goods subject to higher price-cost markups and higher trade costs,
which are conditions often associated with differentiated products (Rauch, 1999).
Feenstra, Markusen, and Rose (1998) estimate gravity models of trade for an aggregate of
differentiated products and for an aggregate of homogeneous products. They find that
income elasticity of exports is higher in the former sample than in the latter, which they
interpret as evidence of home-market effects.

Empirical literature finds support for home-market effects, and so for the
importance of increasing returns for trade.

But existing approaches are subject to

concerns about how these effects are identified. A problem with using the correlation
between industry production and consumption to identify home-market effects is that it
requires industry demand to be uncorrelated with shocks to industry supply. There are
many instances in which this condition may fail, leading to concerns about consistency in
estimation. There are also potential problems in using gravity equations to identify
home-market effects. When estimated on aggregate data the gravity model may hide
cross-industry variation in bilateral trade flows that we would expect to see were homemarket effects present. Additionally, Anderson and van Wincoop (2001) show that many
gravity applications fail to control for the ‘remoteness’ of importing countries and
thereby introduce specification bias into the estimation.
In this paper, we develop an alternative test for home-market effects. Similar to
some previous work, we use the gravity model as a starting point. But distinct from
previous work, we develop a “difference-in-difference” gravity specification that is
consistent with theory and estimable with readily available data. First, we select pairs of
countries that are likely to face common trade barriers in markets to which they export;
second, we restrict attention to two groups of industries, one with high transport costs and
strong scale economies and one with low transport costs and weak scale economies; and
third, we examine whether, across exporter pairs, larger countries tend to export more of
high-transport cost, strong-scale economy goods relative to their exports of low-transport
cost, weak-scale economy goods, as implied by the home-market effect. Our test for

3

home-market effects, then, is to see whether German exports of steel relative to pencils
are higher than Belgian exports of steel relative to pencils.
This approach has several important advantages. By using a gravity framework,
with national income, distance, and similar controls as regressors, we reduce concerns
about simultaneity in the estimation.

By examining exports for country pairs to a

common set of markets, we difference out the impacts of remoteness and trade barriers
on trade flows. And by separating industries by scale economies and transport costs, we
focus the analysis on cases where home-market effects are most likely to appear.
To preview the results, we find that home-market effects exist and that the nature
of these effects depends on industry transport costs. Measuring exporter size using
national GDP, support for home-market effects is strong for industries with very high
transport costs and weak for industries with moderately high transport costs.
Alternatively, measuring exporter size using market potential, which accounts for
demand links between proximate countries, the pattern reverses. Support for homemarket effects is weak for industries with very high transport costs and strong for
industries with moderately high transport costs. These results suggest that for industries
with very high transport costs, it is national market size that determines national exports.
But for industries with moderately high transport costs, it is not the national market that
matters as much as the neighborhood market. In this case, national market size plus
market size in nearby countries determine national exports. As we explain in section 4,
our results differ from those in previous literature and it seems plausible that these
differences are due to our choice of empirical identification strategy.
Our findings that home-market effects vary systematically across industries are

4

important for understanding how falling trade barriers may affect industry location. In
Europe, for instance, there is concern that economic integration will deindustrialize small
countries (Krugman and Venables, 1990). The fear is that lower trade barriers would
allow large countries to attract industry away from small, peripheral countries. Our
results suggest that only in very high transport cost industries would this sort of industry
relocation occur. Following a reduction in trade barriers, moderately high transport cost
industries might actually move into well-located small countries.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we use theory to
develop an empirical framework. In section 3, we describe the data and estimation
issues. In section 4, we present empirical results. And in section 5, we conclude.

2. Theory and Empirical Specification
In this section, we use a standard model of trade with increasing returns to scale
and monopolistic competition (Helpman and Krugman, 1985) to develop an estimation
strategy for identifying home-market effects.

2.1 A Model
Let there be J countries and M sectors, where each sector has a large number of
product varieties. All consumers have identical Cobb-Douglas preferences over sectoral
composites of manufacturing products,
M

U = ∏ Qm

µm

,

(1)

m =1

5

where we temporarily ignore country subscripts, µm is the share of expenditure on sector m
( ∑ µ m = 1 ), and Qm is a composite of symmetric product varieties in sector m given by
m

σ m −1 σ m
σ
Qm = [ ∑ C mi m ] σm −1
i =1
nm

.

(2)

In (2), σm > 1 is the elasticity of substitution between any pair of varieties in m, and nm is the
number of varieties of m produced. There are increasing returns to scale in the production
of each variety such that the minimum cost for producing xim units of variety i in sector m is

f m ( w m , x im ) = w m (a m + b m x im ) ,

(3)

where am and bm are constants and wm is unit factor cost (e.g., the wage, for a single factor of
production, or a factor-price index, for multiple factors), which are assumed to be constant
across varieties of m. In equilibrium each variety is produced by a single monopolisticallycompetitive firm and nm is large, so that the price for each variety is a constant markup over
marginal cost. Free entry drives profits to zero, equating price with average cost.
Consider the variation in product prices across countries. We allow for iceberg
transport costs in shipping goods between countries and for import tariffs, such that the c.i.f.
price of variety i in sector m produced by country j and sold in country k is


 σ
Pimjk = Pimj t mjk (d jk ) γ m =  m  b m w mj t mjk (d jk ) γ m
 σm − 1

(4)

where Pimj is the f.o.b. price of product i in sector m manufactured in country j; tmjk is one
plus the ad valorem tariff in k on imports of m from j; djk is distance between j and k; γm>0

6

is the elasticity of transportation costs with respect to distance; and the second equality
replaces Pimj with a markup over marginal cost (which is constant across varieties of m).4
Next, consider the demand by country k for varieties of m produced in country j.
Let Cimjk be the quantity of variety i from sector m that k purchases from j, which equals,
C imjk = µ m Yk

(Pimjk ) − σm
J n mh

∑ ∑ (Pimhk )

(5)

1− σ m

h =1 i =1

where Yk is national income in k. Define S mjk ≡ ∑ Pimjk C imjk , which is total sales of
i

varieties of sector m by country j to country k. Utilizing the symmetry of product varieties
in preferences and technology (and dropping variety subscripts), these sales equal,

S mjk

 Pmjk 

= µ m Yk n mj 
 Pmk 



1− σ m

(6)

where Pmk is the price index for sector m products in country k (equal to the denominator on
the right of (5) raised to the power, 1/(1-σm)).
To develop the logic of the home-market effect, compare country j’s exports of good
m to country k with some other country h’s exports of good m to country k. Combining
equations (4) and (6), these relative export sales are given by,

S mjk
S mhk

n mj  w mj

=
n mh  w mh






1−σ m

 d jk

d
 hk






(1−σ m ) γ m

(7)

where we assume countries h and j have common production technology and face common
tariffs in country k. Expressing sales in relative terms removes the price index in country k
from the expression and comparing exporters that face common trade policy barriers in k
4

For analytical ease, we assume that the markup of price over marginal cost is a multiplicative function of
production costs, tariffs, and transport costs.

7

removes tariffs from the expression. Since σm > 1, equation (7) shows that for some sector
m, country j’s exports to country k are more likely to exceed country h’s exports to country
k the lower are production costs in j relative to h, the closer to k is j relative to h, and the
larger is the number of product varieties produced in j relative to h. Country j may produce
more product varieties than country h for many reasons, including a home-market effect.
To isolate this effect, compare two sectors: sector m, which has a low value of σm
(and so extensive product differentiation and high markups of price over marginal cost) and
a high value of γ (and so high transport costs), and sector o, which has a high value of σ
(low price-cost markups) and a low value of γ (low transport costs). In what follows, we
will refer to sector m (high markups, high transport costs) as the “treatment” industry and
sector o (low markups, low transport costs) as the “control” industry. From equation (7), the
ratio of relative sales of m versus o goods by countries j and h to country k is,
S mjk / S mhk
Sojk / Sohk

=

n mj / n mh ( w mj / w mh )1−σm
n oj / n oh ( w oj / w oh )1−σo

(d jk / d hk ) (1−σm ) γ m −(1−σo ) γ o

(8)

A home-market effect exists where the ratio (nmj/nmh)/(noj/noh) is higher the larger is country
j relative to country h. In words, for two countries, j and h, the ratio of their relative
exports of high-markup, high-transport cost good m to their relative exports of lowmarkup, low-transport cost good o will be higher the larger is j relative to h.5

5

The simplest proof of the home-market effect (see Krugman, 1980, and Helpman and Krugman, 1985)
uses a model with a single factor of production, two countries, and two sectors, one with a finite
substitution elasticity and positive fixed costs and another with a homogeneous good (i.e., an infinite
substitution elasticity) and zero fixed costs. In this case, the number of goods in the o sector (the
homogeneous-good sector) is one in both countries and the number of differentiated goods country 1
produces relative to country 2 is increasing in the relative size of country 1 to country 2. This result holds
over the range of relative country sizes where both countries produce the differentiated good. If country
sizes are too asymmetric, only the large country produces the differentiated good. As a practical matter, in
our data all exporting countries have positive exports in all industrial sectors we examine.

8

Formal statements of the home-market effect abound in the literature (Krugman,
1980; Helpman and Krugman, 1985; Davis, 1995; Feenstra, Markusen, and Rose, 1998;
Krugman and Venables, 1999). A general intuition for the result is that, with fixed costs in
producing varieties of sector m and transport costs in delivering sector m products to
market, it is cost minimizing for firms to concentrate production of m in larger markets.
This logic depends on there being a sector o, in which transport costs are small and σ is
large. Such products can be made anywhere, because they are cheap to transport and highly
substitutable in consumption. In equilibrium, they are produced in small economies.
To clarify the logic of the home-market effect, we simulate the model based on
explicit assumptions about how transport costs and substitution elasticities vary across
sectors. We assume a single factor of production, labor, and two countries of unequal sizes.
There is a continuum of sectors indexed by z∈[0,1], each of which has a large number of
product varieties. Cobb-Douglas expenditure shares are uniform across sectors. σ is
monotonically decreasing in z according to the formula σ(z)=(2-z)*4, such that σ declines
from 8 to 4 as z rises from 0 to 1 (implying, over the range of z, an increase in the price-cost
markup from 1.13 to 1.25). Transport costs are given by exp(-τ(z)), where τ is increasing
monotonically in z (according to the formula log([15z+3]/[(2-z)*4)-1]) such that τ rises from
0.06 to 0.40 as z rises from 0 to 1. High z sectors, then, have high transport costs and low
σ’s and are good candidates for treatment industries in our framework; low z sectors have
low transport costs and high σ’s and are good candidates for control industries.6 Theory
predicts that high z sectors will be relatively concentrated in the large country and that low z
sectors to be relatively concentrated in the small country.
6

This setup loosely follows the framework in Krugman and Venables (1999).

9

Figure 1 plots the excess concentration of production in the large country – the large
country’s share of world output of a sector minus it’s share of world GDP – against z. This
is done for two scenarios, one in which the large country is 1.2 times the size of the small
country and one in which the size differential is 1.6. Consistent with theory, high z (high
transportation costs, low σ) sectors are relatively concentrated in the large country and low z
(low transportation cost, high σ) sectors are relatively concentrated in the small country.
The extent of excess concentration in the large country is greater the larger is the size
difference between the two countries.

2.2 Empirical Specification
To search for evidence of home-market effects empirically, we specify equation (8)
in log terms using the following regression:
 S mjk / S mhk 
Y
 = α + β ln j
ln
Y
 S ojk / S ohk 
 h




d
 + φ(X j − X h ) + θ ln jk

d

 hk


 + ε mojkh



(9)

where Yj/Yh is relative exporter market size; Xl is a vector of control variables that
determine relative production costs for sectors m and o in country l; and εmojkh is an error
term. Our test for home-market effects is whether β>0, or whether larger countries export
relatively more of high-markup, high-transport cost goods.
Equation (9) is a ‘difference-in-difference’ specification of trade flows between
countries. The dependent variable is for two countries the log difference in their exports
of high-markup, high-transport cost good m minus the log difference in their exports of a
low-markup, low-transport cost good o. The home-market effect implies that for two
countries, j and h, the ratio of their relative exports of good m to their relative exports of

10

good o will be higher the larger is Yj relative to Yh. The countries’ relative exports of
good o act as a control, sweeping out of the dependent variable any general tendency for
one country to export relatively more than the other.
Consider, instead, using the log difference in two countries' exports of good m as
the dependent variable (i.e., the log of the variable on the left of equation (7)). Then the
coefficient β could not be interpreted as capturing a home-market effect since large
countries may export relatively more of all goods. The advantage of the difference-indifference specification is that it (a) controls for the tendency of large countries to export
more of all goods, (b) removes from the estimation tariffs, sectoral price indices, and
home bias effects, all of which are hard to measure, and (c) for exporter pairs with similar
production costs, differences out of the estimation all determinants of relative exports,
except relative distance and relative country size. For completeness, we report estimation
results using both the single log difference of exports (for a pair of exporters, log relative
exports of a single good) and the double log difference of exports (for a pair of exporters,
log relative exports of a treatment industry minus log relative exports of a control
industry) as the dependent variable.
Estimation of equation (9) requires that we place restrictions on the set of industries
and countries included in the sample and define the set of regressors. First, we must choose
pairs of exporting countries that face common trade policy barriers in the countries that
import their goods. It is an added advantage if these country pairs have similar production
costs, such that comparative advantage plays a small role in determining their relative
exports (i.e., in (9), (Xj-Xh)≅0). We choose exporting country pairs that belong to a
common preferential trade area and that have relatively similar average incomes. Second,

11

we must identify a set of high-markup, high-transport cost industries and a set of lowmarkup, low-transport cost industries. This is complicated somewhat by the simplicity of
trade models. The standard framework is the Dixit-Stiglitz (1977) model of monopolistic
competition, in which prices, and so average costs, are a constant markup over marginal
cost, where this markup is fixed by σ. σ, then, determines both the equilibrium extent of
product differentiation (the number of product varieties) and the equilibrium strength of
scale economies (the ratio of average to marginal costs). In reality, product differentiation
and scale economies may not be so tightly related. The apparel industry, for instance, has a
high degree of product differentiation but flat average cost curves. We would not expect
this industry to be subject to a home-market effect. We select high-markup and low-markup
industries on the basis of average plant size, a common metric of scale economies.
A final consideration is how to measure relative country size. In equation (9), we
use relative GDP to capture relative market size for a pair of exporters. This is certainly
appropriate for a world with two countries. But with many countries neighborhood effects
may be important for industry location. Belgium’s national market, for instance, is small
relative to Spain’s. But Belgium has three large neighbors, France, Germany, and the
Netherlands, whereas Spain has one large neighbor, France and one small neighbor,
Portugal. Belgium’s neighbors may be an important source of demand for its output and
may result in the country having stronger home-market effects than its own GDP would
imply. To capture relative market size for Belgium and Spain, we may want to account for
the relative size of both their national markets and their neighboring markets.
The potential for neighborhood effects to influence the location of production is
implied by recent theories of economic geography (Fujita, Krugman, and Venables, 1999).

12

These theories extend trade models based on monopolistic competition to regional settings.
In this body of work, neighborhood effects are captured by a market-potential function, in
which demand for a country’s goods is a function of income in other countries weighted by
transport costs to those economies. Applying this logic, we measure relative exporter size in
two ways. The first is the simple ratio of national GDPs, as in equation (9). The second is
the ratio of the market-potential functions for two countries.7 Following Fujita, Krugman,
and Venables (1999) and Hanson (2001), we define the market potential for country i as the
distance-weighted sum of GDP in other countries, or
J

MPi = ∑ Yl d li

−λ

l =1

(10)

When using market potential to define country size, we replace ln(Yj/Yh) in (9) with
ln(MPj/MPh).8 This approach is similar in spirit to Davis and Weinstein (2002), who use a
gravity-based measure of industry demand to test for home-market effects.

Using

coefficient estimates on the distance variable from the gravity model in Hummels (1999),
we set λ equal to 0.92, but we also report results for other values.9

3. Data and Estimation Issues
The data for the estimation come from several sources. For country exports by
product, we use the World Trade Database for 1990 (Feenstra, Lipsey, and Bowen,
1997). This source gives bilateral trade flows between countries for three- or four-digit
SITC revision 2 product classes.

At this level of industry classification (chemical

7

For other empirical applications of market potential see Hanson (2001) and Redding and Venables (2002).
One issue is how to measure a country’s distance to itself. Following Davis and Weinstein (2002) and
previous literature, we set this distance equal to (land area/π)0.5. Distance to the domestic market is then larger
for countries with greater land mass. We also discuss results for other measures.
9
Hummels’ (1999) estimates of the gravity distance coefficient are similar to results in many other studies.
We choose to use his estimates because we also rely on other results in his paper.

fertilizers, woven cotton fabrics, gas turbines) product classes are better seen as sectoral
aggregates than as individual product varieties, which is consistent with our empirical
specification. We choose 1990 to have a recent year, for which there are more non-zero
observations on bilateral trade at the product level, but not so recent that data on other
country characteristics are unavailable.
For data on GDP, we use the Penn World Tables.

For data on country

characteristics related to production costs, we use nonresidential capital per worker from
the Penn World Tables; available land supply relative to the population and average
education of the adult population from Barro and Lee (2000); and the average wage in
low-skill industries (apparel and textiles) from the UNIDO Industrial data base. For
distance and other gravity variables (whether countries share a common border, whether
countries share a common language), we use data from Haveman (www.eiit.org). Table
1 gives summary statistics on the regression variables.
There are several estimation issues to be addressed. First, we need to select pairs
of exporting countries under the constraint that both members of a pair face common
trade policy barriers in importing countries. To ensure that exporters have diversified
manufacturing industries (and are not specialized in primary commodities or low-skill
goods), we limit the sample of exporters to OECD countries. Within this group, we form
country pairs from sets of countries that belong to a preferential trading arrangement of
some kind. These include the members of the European Economic Community (now
European Union);10 Canada and the United States (U.S.-Canada Free Trade Area); and
New Zealand and Australia (British Commonwealth). This yields a potential number of

10

The European exporter countries are Austria, Belgium-Luxembourg, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden.

14

107 exporter pairs per importer and industry.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution of log relative exporter GDPs (in
which the larger country of a pair occupies the numerator) for all exporter country pairs
in the sample.

There is considerable variation in country size.

For 65% of the

observations one country is at least 75 log points larger than the other and for 40% of the
observations one country is at least 150 log points larger than the other. The variation in
relative market potential within our sample, shown in Figure 3, is also considerable, but
is less than that for relative GDP. This is not surprising, since the market potential
measure places less weight on own-country GDP and more weight on other-countries’
GDP, reducing the cross-country variation in market size.
Second, we need to choose the set of countries that import goods from these
exporters. One might presume that we should include all importer countries in the
sample. A problem with this approach is that many small countries have zero imports
from many of their bilateral trading partners, as one would expect given their size. In
many contexts, having the dependent variable take zero values can be addressed with
standard techniques, such as the Tobit. In our case, however, the dependent variable is
constructed from four separate export values (since it is a double log difference).
Determining the joint probability that two or more of these values are zero, as would be
necessary to employ a Tobit-style estimator, is a complicated problem and beyond the
scope of this paper. Instead, we limit our sample to the 15 largest importing countries,11
which in 1990 accounted for 69% of world imports of manufacturing goods. Restricting

11

These are Australia, Austria, Belgium-Luxembourg, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Among other large
importers, we exclude Hong Kong and Singapore, which are entrepot economies, and China, which has
much lower per capita income than other large importers.

15

the sample in this way greatly reduces the number of observations with zero export
values.12 Since the theory applies to importers on a case-by-case basis, there is in
principle no loss in focusing on large importers. To check the sensitivity of the results to
this restriction, we report results using samples of either the 58 largest importers (97% of
1990 world imports) or the 7 largest importers (52% of 1990 world imports).13
Third, we need to identify industries with strong scale economies and low
transport costs and industries with weak scale economies and high transport costs. To do
so, we use data on average industry plant size from the 1992 U.S. Census of
Manufacturers and data on average industry transport costs in 1990 based on Feenstra’s
(1996) import series for U.S. industries. We use the SIC code to define these industries,
as it is the only classification for which we can obtain data on both industry plant size and
industry transport costs. We then match the selected SIC industries to SITC industries.
The measure of transport costs we use is freight costs as a share of total import value by
industry across all countries that export to the United States.14
Table 2 lists the industries in the sample. To obtain this group, we rank industries
by average employment per establishment and by average freight costs. We first select
industries with freight costs in either the bottom third of the industry distribution of
freight costs, which constitute the low-transport cost group, or in the top third of the
distribution of freight costs, which constitute the high-transport cost group. Table 3
shows quantiles for freight costs and plant size. We then define the control group of
12

For this sample, 81% of the observations have non-zero values for all four components of the dependent
variable. To preserve information on zero trade values, we follow Eaton and Tamura (1994) and assume
countries with zero reported bilateral imports of a good actually import minute quantities, which we set to
one. The results are unaffected by dropping observations that contain zero trade values from the sample.
13
For the samples of 7 large importers and 58 large importers, respectively, 85% and 47% of the
observations have non-zero values for all four components of the dependent variable.

industries to be those with transport costs in the top third and above median average plant
size and the treatment group of industries to be those with transport costs in the bottom
third and below median average plant size.15 From these two groups, we exclude (a)
industries for which natural resources are likely to influence heavily industry location
(food processing (SIC 20), tobacco (SIC 21), lumber and wood products (SIC 24),
petroleum refining (SIC 29)); (b) industries that could not be concorded easily to an SITC
industry at the three digit-level (fabricated metal products (SIC 34), industries with a “not
elsewhere classified” designation); and (c) SIC industries that can only be matched to
SITC industries at the three-digit level and whose four-digit industries show high
variance in either plant size or freight cost (electric and electronic equipment (SIC 36),
some nonmetallic minerals (SIC 32), jewelry (SIC 391)).16
One might be concerned that large average plant size is a noisy measure of
industries with high markups of price over marginal cost. For independent verification
that our large-plant size industries appear to have relatively high markups and that our
small-plant size industries appear to have relatively low markups, we draw on Hummels’
(1999) estimates of the elasticity of substitution (σ) by industry. Hummels estimates a
specification similar to (6), using data on bilateral trade flows, import tariffs, transport
costs, etc. In theory, σ pins down both the markup of price over marginal cost and the
ratio of average to marginal cost (under free entry) for an industry. Hummels estimates
substitution elasticities by two-digit SITC industry. In Table 2, we report his estimates

15

This excludes from the sample low-transport cost industries with above median average plant size (most
transportation equipment (SIC 37) and chemicals (SIC 28)) and high-transport cost industries with below
median average plant size (textiles (SIC 22), apparel (SIC 23), leather and footwear (SIC 31)).
16
We also exclude printing trades machinery (SIC 3555, SITC 726), due to the fact that measured trade of
this good was zero for nearly all bilateral country pairings, and cement (SIC 3241, SITC 6612), as this
industry had zero bilateral trade values for nearly two-thirds of bilateral country pairings.

17

that correspond to the three or four digit SITC industries in our data. 17 It is reassuring to
find that our large-plant size industries have low values of σ (indicating high price-cost
markups and high average to marginal cost ratios), with a median value of 3.5, and that
our small-plant size industries have high values of σ (indicating low price-cost markups
and low average to marginal cost ratios), with a median value of 7.1.18
We estimate equation (9) by matching industries from the first group in Table 2
with industries from the second group in Table 2. The high-transport cost, large-plant
size industries are the treatment group that theory suggests will be subject to home
market effects; the low-transport cost, small-plant size industries are the control group.

4. Estimation Results
4.1 Preliminary Results
Before we present the main estimation results, it is useful to consider a simple
specification in which the dependent variable is for a pair of exporters log relative exports
of a good (which is equivalent to the numerator of the regressand in (9)) and the
independent variables are as in equation (9). We are interested in seeing whether the
results of this initial ‘single-difference’ specification are consistent with results for
standard gravity models, which show an elasticity of bilateral exporters with respect to
exporter GDP of about one. The results will also reveal whether the correlation between
relative exports and relative exporter size is larger for treatment (high-transport cost,

17

These are OLS estimates. Hummels (1999) also reports IV estimates of σ, which tend to produce lower
values of σ for our large-plant size industries and higher values of σ for our small-plant size industries.
18
Other industries are poor candidates for treatment or control groups. Those with low values of σ (less
than 4) tend to be intensive in natural resources (sugar, animal oils), and those with high values of σ
(greater than 7) tend to be intensive in natural resources (meat, dairy products), to have large plant sizes
(organic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, communications equipment), or to have high transport costs (leather).

18

large plant size) industries than for control (low-transport cost, small plant size)
industries, as would be consistent with home-market effects.
Table 4 shows single-difference gravity estimation results for the 8 treatment and
13 control industries in our sample. The regressors are for a pair of exporters log relative
exporter size, dummy variables for whether an exporter and importer share a common
border or a common language (in level differences for an exporter pair), log relative
capital per worker, log relative land area per capita, log relative average schooling, and
log relative wages in low-skill industries.19

The variable of interest is log relative

exporter size, which we measure as either log relative exporter GDP or log relative
exporter market potential. We show coefficient estimates for these variables only. In the
appendix, we show complete estimation results for a subset of industries.
Coefficient estimates on relative exporter GDP are uniformly positive and in most
cases precisely estimated. Large countries export more of all kinds of goods, both those
with high transport costs and those with low transport costs. This is consistent with
estimation of standard gravity models, which show that bilateral exports are increasing in
exporter income.

We obtain qualitatively similar results when we replace relative

exporter GDP with relative exporter market potential, though these estimates are
somewhat less precise and contain some negative values.
More illuminating is to compare results for relative exporter size for treatment and
control industries. The average coefficient on exporter GDP is 1.5 for the treatment
industries and 1.1 for the control industries and on exporter market potential is 1.5 for the
treatment industries and 0.9 for the control industries. This is suggestive of home-market
19

Since the data include observations on relative income, distance, and other variables for given exporter
pairs across multiple importing countries, we correct the standard errors to allow for correlation in the
errors across observations that share the same exporter pair.

19

effects. Exporters with larger home markets have higher exports of high-transport cost,
large-plant-size goods and lower exports of low-transport cost, small-plant-size goods. It
is also apparent in Table 4 that the impact of relative size on relative exports is larger for
some control industries than for some treatment industries. This is an initial indication
that support for home-market effects may not be uniform across industries.

4.2 Main Results
Tables 5a and 5b show estimation results for equation (9).

The dependent

variable is for two countries log relative exports of a treatment (high-transport cost, largeplant size) industry minus log relative exports of a control (low-transport cost, smallplant size) industry.

The independent variables are as in Table 4.

We estimate

regressions separately for each of the 104 (8x13) treatment and control industry matches
in the data.20 In Table 5a, the measure of relative exporter size is relative GDP and for
brevity we report coefficient estimates for this variable only. The sample is exports by
107 country pairs to 15 large importing countries. Treatment industries, in order of
ascending freight costs, are arrayed across the columns; control industries, also in order
of ascending freight costs, are arrayed down the rows.
Table 5a shows some evidence of home-market effects and of variation in these
effects across industries (as suggested by Table 4).

Of the 104 regressions, the

coefficient on relative exporter GDPs is positive in 76 (73%) of the cases and positive
and statistically significant at the 10% level in 54 (52%) of the cases. Overall, this is
hardly overwhelming support for home-market effects. But, as we shall see, the results

20

Since the regressors do not vary across industries, there is no gain to estimating equation (9) jointly
across pairs of treatment and control industries (OLS is just as efficient as GLS).

20

are stronger for treatment industries with particular characteristics.
Table 5b summarizes the coefficient estimates in Table 5a for subgroups of
treatment and control industry pairings.

For each group we report the fraction of

regressions with a positive coefficient estimate on log relative exporter GDP and the
fraction of regressions in which this coefficient is positive and statistically significant at
the 10% level. Treatment industries with very high transport costs show strong evidence
of home-market effects. Of the 39 regressions for the three treatment industries in the top
15% of transport costs (clay products, steel mills, steel pipes and tubes), the coefficient
on relative exporter GDPs is positive in 87% of the cases and positive and statistically
significant at the 10% level in 74% of the cases. For the five treatment industries in the
next 20% of transport costs, the coefficient on relative exporter GDP is positive in only
58% of the cases and positive and statistically significant in only 37% of the cases. Thus,
we find the strongest support for home-market effects where we would expect, among the
treatment industries with highest transport costs. No clear patterns appear when we break
out low-transport cost industries in terms of either freight costs or average plant size.
Table 6a shows coefficient estimates for relative exporter size measured using
relative exporter market potential. There is again variation in the strength of homemarket effects across industries, but the patterns are quite different from Table 5a. This
is perhaps easier to see in Table 6b, which summarizes the results in Table 6a. With
exporter size measured in terms of market potential, home-market effects are strongest
among treatment industries with lower transport costs (with transport costs between the
65th and 85th percentiles). For treatment industries in the top 15% of transport costs, the
coefficient on relative exporter market potential is positive and statistically significant in

21

only 8% of the cases. For treatment industries in the next 20% of transport costs, the
coefficient on relative exporter market potential is positive in 89% of the cases and
positive and statistically significant in 75% of the cases. For all treatment industries,
evidence of home-market effects is stronger when compared against the control industries
with either the lowest transport costs or the smallest average plant sizes.
To summarize the results, support for home-market effects depends on the
measure of relative exporter size that is used. For relative exporter size measured using
GDP, support for home-market effects is strong for treatment industries with very high
transport costs and weak for treatment industries with moderately high transport costs.
For relative exporter size measured using market potential, this pattern is reversed.
Support for home-market effects is weak for very high transport cost treatment industries
and strong for moderately high transport cost treatment industries.
One explanation for these results is that the relevant definition of exporter size for
the home-market effect depends on the transport costs of the industry in question. For
industries with strong scale economies and very high transport costs, the relevant market
for exporter size may be the national market. Very high transport costs may mean that
the demand kick from an exporter’s neighboring markets is small. To return to the
Belgium and Spain example, in strong scale economy and very high transport cost
industries, national market size may matter more for industry location than how big an
exporting country’s neighbors are. In these industries, Belgium may get only a small
demand boost from France, Germany, and the Netherlands, such that their proximity does
not compensate for Belgium having a smaller national market than Spain. For industries
with strong scale economies and moderately high transport costs, however, the relevant

22

market for exporter size appears to include neighboring countries. Transport costs may
be low enough that industries in a given country get a demand boost from nearby nations.
In these cases, Belgium’s neighbors may generate enough demand for Belgium’s goods
that the country offers industries a larger base of demand than does Spain.

4.3 Further Results and Sensitivity Analysis
To gauge the sensitivity of our findings to sample selection and model
specification, we examine the impact on the results of imposing alternative sample
restrictions and of using alternative sets of regression variables.
We begin by expanding the list of importers to include the 58 countries with the
highest value of imports in 1990 (which together accounted for 97% of world imports)
and then re-estimating equation (9). Table 7a summarizes results using GDP to measure
relative exporter size and Table 7b summarizes results using market potential to measure
relative exporter size. These findings are quite similar to those in Tables 5a and 6a. This
is reassuring, given that a higher fraction of bilateral industry trade values are zero for
this expanded sample of importers. Zero industry trade values in the data thus do not
appear to be overly influencing the results (see notes 12 and 13).
In Table 7a (market size measured using GDP), for treatment industries in the top
15% of transport costs, the coefficient on relative exporter GDPs is positive in 87% of
cases and positive and statistically significant in 74% of cases. For treatment industries
in the next 20% of transport costs, the coefficient on relative exporter GDPs is positive in
59% of cases and positive and statistically significant in 37% of cases. In Table 7b
(market size measured using market potential), for treatment industries in the top 15% of

23

transport costs, the coefficient on relative exporter GDPs is positive in 31% of cases and
positive and statistically significant in 21% of cases. And for treatment industries in the
next 20% of transport costs, the coefficient on relative exporter GDPs is positive in 88%
of cases and positive and statistically significant in 72% of cases.
In Table 8, we try alternative specifications and sample restrictions. First, we
restrict the sample of importers to be the seven largest importing countries. Relative to
samples used in Tables 5-7, this sample contains fewer observations with zero bilateral
industry trade values. These results are quite similar to those already reported. Second,
we drop from the sample of exporters countries in Europe with relatively low per capita
incomes (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain). This has very little impact on the results.
This finding is helpful in that it suggests that our controls for relative production costs do
a reasonably adequate job of controlling for differences in comparative advantage across
countries. Third, we use alternative measures of market potential. We allow λ, the
coefficient on distance in equation (10), to be as large as 1 or as small as 0.84, which
represents an increase or decrease of λ by two-standard deviations based on Hummels’
(1999) gravity estimates. These results are very similar to those in Table 6a. Fourth, in
constructing the market-potential measure, we experiment with changing the definition of
a country’s distance to itself. We set this distance equal to one, rather than π-0.5(land
area).5 (see note 8). This specification produces results very similar to Table 5a. This
alternative definition of market potential places a greater weight on national market size
than does the definition used in the regressions in Tables 6 and 7, and so yields results
that are similar to using national GDPs as the measure of exporter size.

24

4.4 Discussion
Previous empirical literature has sought to identify home-market effects either by
(a) comparing gravity-model estimation results for aggregates of differentiated-product
industries and homogeneous-product industries, or (b) estimating the cross-country
correlation between industry output and the local demand for industry output. Relative
to the first body of work, we allow for greater industry heterogeneity in the strength of
home-market effects. Our findings strongly suggest that such industry heterogeneity is
important empirically. The second body of work, like ours, tests for the presence of
home-market effects at the level of individual industries. As we have mentioned, one
concern about this second approach is that it requires strong assumptions about the
orthogonality of industry demand and supply shocks. A justification for our approach is
that it appears to be relatively free from concerns about simultaneity bias.

These

concerns are moot, of course, if the two approaches yield similar results. To see whether
or not this is the case, we compare our results with representative results using the
industry supply-industry demand approach.
In one prominent example of this approach, Davis and Weinstein (2002) find
evidence consistent with home-market effects for many industries, including food
products, textiles, leather, and wood products. These are industries with high-transport
costs, small average plant sizes, and large estimated substitution elasticities (see notes 15
and 18). Since these are industries with high-transport costs but presumably weak scale
economies, our selection criterion would suggest that they would be poor candidates for
either treatment or control industries. These are not industries that theory would suggest
are subject to home-market effects. Based on our approach, we would interpret evidence

25

of home-market effects for these industries as at best as neutral support for the
proposition that increasing returns influence trade patterns. Davis and Weinstein (2002)
find evidence inconsistent with home-market effects for other industries, including paper
and pulp, industrial chemicals, other chemicals, non-metallic mineral products, nonelectric machinery, electrical machinery, and transportation equipment.21 Of this group,
our selection criterion identifies pulp and paper, industrial chemicals, and non-metallic
mineral products as containing good candidates for treatment industries. We find
evidence consistent with home-market effects for some three- or four-digit industries
(paper, glassware, inorganic chemicals, clay) within this group.
Thus, our approach, which is based on a difference-in-difference gravity
specification, yields results that are quite different from the industry supply-industrydemand approach. While a full evaluation of competing approaches to test for homemarket effects is beyond the scope of this paper, it is clear that the strategy one takes to
identify home-market effects matters greatly for what one finds.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, we test for home-market effects using a difference-in-difference
gravity specification. Home-market effects exist when relatively large countries have
relatively high exports of goods with high-transport costs and strong scale economies.
Such effects are predicted by models of trade based on increasing returns to scale but not
by models of trade based on comparative advantage. In our estimation approach, we

21

In David and Weinstein (2002), there are a third set of industries (including beverage industries and
fabricated metals) for which results on home-market effects are inconclusive. The results of theirs that we
cite are for two-digit industries. They also report results for three-digit industries, but since these estimates
are based on very small sample sizes we do not dwell on them here.

26

select pairs of exporting countries that belong to a common preferential trade area and
examine their exports of goods with high transport costs and strong scale economies
relative to their exports of goods with low transport costs and weak scale economies.
Previous tests of home-market effects may be subject to concerns about simultaneity bias,
specification bias, or industry heterogeneity.

The difference-in-difference gravity

specification that we use sweeps out of the regression the effects of import tariffs, home
bias in demand, and relative goods’ prices in importing countries. As in the estimation of
standard gravity models, our specification uses plausibly exogenous regressors.
Empirical support for home-market effects depends on how we measure relative
exporter size. When measuring exporter size using national GDP, support for homemarket effects is strong for industries with very high transport costs and weak for
industries with moderately high transport costs. Alternatively, when measuring exporter
size using market potential, which accounts for demand links between nearby countries,
the pattern is reversed. Support for home-market effects is weak for the industries with
very high transport costs and strong for industries with moderately high transport costs.
Our results suggest that in very high transport cost industries export production
tends to concentrate in large countries. For these industries, home-market effects appear
to be operative in the standard sense. Relative to small countries, large countries have
high exports of goods subject to strong scale economies and high transport costs. For
industries with moderately high transport costs, export production appears to concentrate
in neighborhoods with strong regional demand. Export production in these industries
may concentrate in small countries, as long as these countries have large neighbors that
increase effective demand for goods produced in the country. These results suggest that

27

the potential for falling trade barriers to deindustrialize small economies is weaker than
previous theoretical and empirical literature would indicate.
As far as we are aware, the interaction between transport costs, scale economies,
and the location of export production that we uncover has not been found in previous
studies. One particular feature of our empirical approach may aid in identifying these
effects. We select industries that theory suggests are good candidates for home-market
effects and we make explicit comparisons between export production in these industries
and in a control group of industries. For countries to have excess concentration of
production in some industries, they must have an under concentration of production in
other industries. Our framework exploits these general equilibrium effects explicitly.

Notes: This table shows the coefficient estimates on all independent variables from
regressions in which the dependent variable is log relative industry exports for a pair of
countries for select industries. T-statistics (calculated from standard errors that have been
adjusted for correlation of the errors across observations that share the same pair of
exporting countries) are in parentheses. For each industry, the sample is relative bilateral
exports by 107 country pairs to 15 large importing countries (1262 observations).

Notes: All variables are differences in log values for pairs of exporting countries (except
for common language and common border, which are level differences in dummy
variables). The exporter pairs are Australia-New Zealand, Canada-United States, and all
pair wise combinations of the set, Austria, Belgium-Luxembourg, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal, Spain, and Sweden. The importing countries are Australia, Austria, BelgiumLuxembourg, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. (In this table, exports are log
differences for one industry; in most regressions, exports are double-log differences.)

Notes: Freight costs equal (c.i.f. industry imports/customs value of industry imports)-1, and
are based on U.S. imports in 1990 from Feenstra (1996). Plant size is industry average
workers per establishment, based on the 1992 U.S. Census of Manufacturers. σ is the OLS
estimate of the elasticity of substitution in Hummels (1999) for the corresponding two-digit
SITC industry. All estimates are statistically significant at the 5% level. See his paper for
more details on the estimation technique.

Notes to Table 5a:
This table shows coefficient estimates on relative log exporter GDP for the specification shown
in equation (9). T-statistics (calculated from standard errors that have been adjusted for
correlation of the errors across observations that share the same pair of exporting countries) are
shown in parentheses. Coefficient estimates and t-statistics for other variables in the regressions
are suppressed. Some results are presented in an appendix.
All regressions are estimated separately for each pair of industries (which includes one hightransport cost industry and one low-transport industry). For each industry pair, the sample is
1262 observations on relative exports by 107 high-income country pairs to 15 large importing
countries. High-transport cost industries are arrayed (in ascending order of transport costs)
across the columns; low-transport cost industries are arrayed (in ascending order of transport
costs) down the rows. The dependent variable is, for a given pair of exporters, the log difference
in their exports of the high-transport cost good minus the log difference in their exports of the
low-transport cost good. The independent variables are the log difference in the exporters’
GDPs, the log difference in the exporters’ distances to the importing country, the difference in
dummy variables for whether the exporters are adjacent to the importer, the difference in dummy
variables for whether the exporters share a common language with the importer, the log
difference in the exporters’ capital per worker, the log difference in the exporters’ average years
of education among the adult population, the log difference in the exporters’ land area per
population, and the log difference in the exporters’ average wage in low-skill industries.

Notes: This table summarizes the regression results in Table 5a. Table 5a shows estimated
coefficients on log relative exporter GDP from 104 regressions, where each regression matches a
high-transport cost industry to a low-transport cost industry. This table shows, for subsets of
industry matches, the fractions of regressions with a positive coefficient estimate and with a
positive coefficient estimate that is statistically significant at the 10% level.

The sample of exporting and importing countries is identical to that in Table 5a. The only
change is that the measure of relative exporter size is relative exporter market potential (instead
of relative exporter GDP).

Notes: For both tables, the specification and sample of exporting countries is identical to that in
Tables 5 and 6. The only change is that the sample of importing countries is now enlarged to be
the 58 countries with the highest total value of manufacturing imports in 1990. The sample for
each regression is 5115 observations on exporter-pair, importing-country combinations

Notes: This table summarizes the results from sensitivity analysis. This table shows, for each case,
the fractions of regressions with a positive coefficient estimate on relative exporter size and with a
positive coefficient estimate that is statistically significant at the 10% level. The 7-importer sample
has U.S., Germany, Japan, France, U.K., Italy and Canada with 597 observations. The rich-exporter
sample has 762 observations and the following exporter pairs: Australia-New Zealand, CanadaUnited States, and all pair wise combinations of the set, Austria, Belgium-Luxembourg, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. The
alternative market potential measure sets a country’s distance to itself equal to 1.
