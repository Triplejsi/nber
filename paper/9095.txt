How Do Large Depreciations Affect Firm Performance?

JEL No. F1, F2, F3
ABSTRACT
This paper examines how 12 “major depreciations” between 1997 and 2000 affected different
measures of firm performance in a sample of over 13,500 companies from around the world. Results
suggest that in the year after depreciations, firms have significantly higher growth in market capitalization,
but significantly lower growth in net income (when measured in local currency). Firms with a higher
share of foreign sales exposure have significantly better performance after depreciations, according to a
range of indicators. Firms with higher debt ratios tend to have lower net income growth, but there is no
robust relationship between debt exposure and the other performance variables. Larger firms frequently
have worse performance than smaller firms, although the significance and robustness of this result
fluctuates across specifications.

Introduction

In the later half of the 1990’s, a number of countries experienced substantial currency
depreciations. These depreciations include not only the well-known currency crises where
countries abandoned pegged exchange rates, such as in Thailand and Korea in 1997, but also less
well-documented examples where countries with more flexible exchange rates experienced
unusually large depreciations, such as in Mexico and South Africa in 1998. In some cases, these
depreciations were followed by a surge in production and improvement in economic growth,
while in other cases the depreciations were followed by a decline in output and severe recession.
Why are some depreciations expansionary and others contractionary? This paper partially
addresses this question by focusing on one specific aspect of depreciations – how they affect firm
performance. Depreciations could affect firm performance through a number of channels, such as
raising the cost of imported inputs relative to other factors of production, providing exporters
with a relative cost advantage relative to foreign competitors, or generating higher borrowing
costs and a contraction in lending. Although the impact of depreciations on firm performance is
only one component determining how depreciations affect aggregate economic growth, it can be
an important and significant determinant of why some depreciations are expansionary and others
are contractionary. Moreover, the firm-level impact of depreciations has not been well examined
in previous work and the basic stylized facts have not yet been documented.
Table 1 shows the diverse impact that 12 recent depreciations have had on firm sales
growth and net income growth.1 There is a remarkable difference in firm performance across
different countries – even during the same crisis periods. For example, during the Asian crisis and
corresponding depreciations in 1997, the median growth rates in sales and net income for South
Korean firms were –42% and –69%, respectively, while the comparable growth rates for
Malaysian firms were –9% and –28%. In 1998, however, the relative performance of firms in
Malaysia and Korea reversed. Firms in Korea quickly recovered from the crisis and appeared to

1

benefit from the depreciations, with median growth in sales and net income of +35% and +19%,
respectively. The performance of Malaysian firms continued to deteriorate, with median growth
in sales and net income of –25% and –75%. Moreover, the experiences of firms in the Czech
Republic, Greece, and Mexico suggest that firms do not necessarily exhibit negative performance
after depreciations. For example, median sales growth for firms in all three countries was positive
after their depreciations in 1998.

<<INSERT TABLE 1 HERE>>

This paper attempts to better understand these patterns by examining how recent
depreciations affected different measures of firm performance. More specifically, the paper uses a
sample of over 13,500 firms from 42 countries to examine the impact of 12 “major depreciations”
between 1997 and 2000. It evaluates firm performance based on the immediate impact of
depreciations on sales and net income, as well as the expected longer-term impact as measured by
changes in market capitalization and asset value. The paper also analyzes how individual firm
characteristics, such as output type, foreign sales exposure, production structure, debt
outstanding, size, and profitability determine the impact of depreciations on performance.
Results suggest that in the year after depreciations, firms have significantly higher growth
in market capitalization (when measured in local currency or US dollars), but significantly lower
growth in net income (when measured in local currency). Firms with greater foreign sales
exposure have significantly better performance, according to a range of performance variables.
Firms with higher debt ratios tend to have lower net income growth after depreciations, but there
is no robust relationship between debt levels and the other performance variables. Larger firms
often have worse performance than smaller firms, although the significance and robustness of this

result fluctuates across specifications. There appears to be no consistent relationship between a
firm’s profitability or capital/asset ratio and the impact of depreciations on firm performance.
The remainder of this paper is divided into five sections. Section II provides a brief
review of related literature. Section III describes the depreciation events and data set. Section IV
presents general results on how depreciations impact firm performance. Section V provides more
detailed evidence on which specific firm characteristics determine how depreciations affect
performance. Section VI concludes.

Literature Review

This paper is related to four diverse branches of literature: the impact of devaluations on exports;
the effect of financial crises on macroeconomic variables; the importance of exchange-rate
exposure to stock returns; and the extent of pass-through from currency movements to goods’
prices. Each of these branches of literature is so extensive that this survey does not make any
attempt to discuss all of the relevant papers. Instead, it simply highlights the key questions and
approaches and refers to recent surveys and articles that are closely related to this paper. After the
literature review, this section closes by discussing one closely related paper, which does not fall
into any of these four categories, in more detail.
The first branch of related literature examines how devaluations affect export growth. A
standard argument justifying devaluations is that they should reduce the relative cost of exports
on international markets and therefore improve export growth. There are, however, a number of
reasons why devaluations may not have this desired effect, such as if the demand for exports is
relatively inelastic or imported inputs are a large component of production. Ghei and Pritchett
(1999) provide a detailed summary of why devaluations may or may not improve export
performance, as well as why it is difficult to measure these effects. After a review of the

3

empirical work on this subject, they conclude that exports typically increase after a devaluation,
and that most of this response occurs rapidly (in about one or two years).2
A closely related branch of literature examines how devaluations affect not only exports,
but also other macroeconomic variables such as output, income, investment, and inflation.
Agénor and Montiel (1996) provide an excellent summary of this literature and develop a
general-equilibrium model showing the various channels by which devaluations can affect the
macroeconomy. They also survey empirical work on this subject and conclude that the evidence
on whether devaluations are contractionary is mixed.3 More recently, several papers extend this
line of research to examine the impact of "crises" (which are generally defined to include
movements in interest rates and/or foreign reserves, as well as exchange rates) on macroeconomic
variables. Gupta, Mishra and Sahay (2000) is one of the most recent papers on this subject. Their
results suggest that about 40% of currency crises between 1970 and 1990 have been
expansionary.
A third branch of literature takes a firm-level (instead of macroeconomic) approach and
measures how exchange-rate exposure affects stock returns for different types of companies.
Most of these papers estimate reduced-form, market models of how exchange-rate movements
affect stock returns. Dominguez and Tesar (2001) is one of the most recent and thorough
examples of this literature.4 They perform an extensive series of tests and conclude that about
12% to 23% of firms are significantly exposed to exchange-rate movements. These low estimates
of exposure agree with most work on this subject. Forbes (2000) tests for the importance of
different factors in explaining how exchange rate movements affect stock returns in a sample of
over 10,000 companies located around the world during the Asian and Russian crises. Results
2

Several papers have also examined specific examples of how devaluations affected export growth. For
example, Duttagupta and Spilimbergo (2000), Higgins and Klitgaard (2000), and Barth and Dinmore
(1999) examine the impact of the 1997-98 devaluations on Asian exports.
3
Edwards (1989) also provides an excellent survey of this literature and detailed evaluation of the historical
evidence on how devaluations impact a variety of macroeconomic variables. Kamin and Klau (1998) find

4

suggest that trade linkages are important determinants of how these crises affected individual
companies’ stock returns.
A final literature closely related to this paper examines how exchange-rate movements
affect output prices. This literature includes the work on pricing-to-market and pass-through, and
emphasizes the role of industrial structure and the form of competition.5 In certain situations,
exchange-rate movements may be wholly absorbed in a firm’s price-cost margins and have no
impact on product prices. Dornbusch (1987) develops these ideas in several simple models, and
numerous papers have found evidence of pricing-to-market in specific industries. Goldberg and
Knetter (1997) is an excellent survey of the empirical literature on this subject. They conclude
that the impact of exchange-rate movements on local currency prices of foreign products varies
widely by industry, and that for products shipped to the U.S, the average price response is about
one-half the exchange-rate movement.6
Despite the range of frameworks and empirical tests used in these four branches of
literature, none of these papers has explicitly addressed the key question explored in this paper:
how do depreciations affect firm performance? The first two branches of literature focus on
macroeconomic relationships and country-level evidence. The last two branches use firm-level
models and data, but only consider how exchange-rate movements affect stock returns or product
prices.
There is one paper, however, that does not fall into any of the four categories discussed
above and which is closely related to this paper. Forbes (2002) examines how a series of major
devaluations affected commodity firms in the “crisis” country as well as competitors in the rest of
no evidence that devaluations are contractionary in the long run. Calvo and Reinhart (2000) compare the
impact of currency crises on macroeconomic variables for emerging markets versus developed countries.
4
Jorion (1990) is a classic example of this literature.
5
More recently, several papers have extended this framework to examine how exchange-rate movements
affect micro-level variables other than prices. For example, Campa and Goldberg (1999) examine the
impact of exchange-rate movements on sectoral investment. Klein, Schuh and Triest (2000) and Goldberg
and Tracy (1999) examine the impact on wages and employment.

the world. The paper focuses on one particular aspect of devaluations – how they affect the
relative cost of labor and capital and therefore influence firm production levels, profitability,
investment decisions, and stock returns. It develops these ideas in a small, open-economy model
and then performs a series of empirical tests using information for about 1,100 firms in 10
commodity industries. The empirical tests support the model’s main prediction that immediately
after devaluations, firms in the crisis country have higher growth rates for output and operating
profits than competitors in other countries. Results also support the prediction that the effect of
devaluations on capital investment and stock returns (and therefore expected long-run output and
profits) is determined by capital/labor ratios and changes in the cost of capital.
This paper builds on the framework in Forbes (2002) in several ways. First, instead of
focusing solely on commodity firms, it examines the impact of devaluations on a much larger set
of companies from a range of industries. Second, this paper considers a wider range of effects of
devaluations on firm performance. Instead of focusing mainly on how capital-labor ratios
determine the impact of devaluations, it also considers the importance of output characteristics,
foreign sales exposure, debt outstanding, firm size, and profitability. Third, instead of focusing
solely on “devaluation events” (when countries suddenly abandon rigid exchange rate regimes),
this paper also considers “depreciation events” (when countries with more flexible exchange rate
regimes experienced unusually rapid losses in their currency’s value).

III.

Depreciation Events and Data Set

The following analysis defines “depreciation events” as any 4-week period when a country’s US
dollar exchange rate depreciated by 10% or more.7 In order to correspond to the firm-level data
set, the period considered is January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1999. Also, it only includes
6

One noteworthy study that combines this approach with the work on exchange-rate exposure is Allayannis
and Ihrig (2000). They examine how market structure, including export and import competitiveness, affects
the exchange-rate exposure of a large sample of US firms.

6

countries with information for at least 50 firms during this period. Table 2 lists the resulting 12
depreciation events in chronological order, as well as the months when the depreciations
occurred. This list of depreciation events includes the well-known currency crises, such as the
series of devaluations in Asia in the later half of 1997 and the Brazilian devaluation in early 1999.
It also includes a series of depreciations that were not standard currency crises, but involved the
adjustment of more flexible exchange rate regimes (such as Mexico and Israel in 1998).8

<<INSERT TABLE 2 HERE>>

The firm-level dataset is compiled from the Worldscope March 2001 CD-ROM published
by Primark. This Worldscope database contains balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, and
general company information for firms from 51 countries, representing about 90% of global
market capitalization (according to their literature).9 The dataset includes historical information
on firms that became inactive due to a merger, bankruptcy, or any other reason. For this analysis,
I include companies that were active for at least 1 year during the period from 1997 through 2000,
and only include countries that have information for at least 50 firms during this period. I also
exclude all financial firms (SIC codes 60-69), since the analysis of how depreciations affect sales,
net income, and assets is not directly relevant. The Worldscope database is augmented with
macroeconomic statistics from the International Monetary Fund’s International Financial
Statistics CD-ROM (from March 2001).
7

The exchange-rate data is from Datastream. After a depreciation event, the next year is excluded so that
there can be, at most, one depreciation event within any 12-month period.
8
Some well-known currency crises (such as the devaluations in Russia in 1998 and Ecuador in 1999) are
not included since there is insufficient firm-level data for these countries.
9
There are several limitations with this data. First, since Worldscope only reports information that is
publicly available, virtually all of the sample consists of publicly traded companies. Most private and
government-owned companies are not included. Second, although Worldscope attempts to correct for
major differences in cross-country accounting standards, significant differences may still exist for certain
variables. The analysis below addresses this problem by using a range of statistics to test each hypothesis
and by examining the impact of country-specific effects on the results. Third, there are a number of extreme

7

The resulting firm-level data set includes information for over 13, 500 firms in 42
countries. Table 3 shows the distribution of firms by country, as well as median sales (in US
dollars). Appendix A lists the statistics for each firm used in the following analysis and includes
detailed information on how each variable is defined and/or calculated.

<<INSERT TABLE 3 HERE>>

This dataset includes the 12 countries that experienced depreciation events (as listed in
Table 2), as well as 30 countries that did not experience substantial depreciations between 1997
and 2000. The full sample of firms is necessary to compare the performance of firms in
depreciating countries versus firms in the rest of the world, as well as to control for any global
industry and/or time trends.10 As shown at the bottom of Table 3, firms in depreciating countries
comprise about 20% of the sample and tend to have smaller sales. This partially reflects the fact
that firms in emerging markets (which have a higher incidence of major depreciations) tend to be
smaller than in wealthier countries. This also captures the fact that depreciations in the local
currency/US dollar exchange rate will, by definition, reduce the dollar value of firm statistics.
Finally, this trend could also indicate that after depreciations, firms tend to decrease investment
(thereby reducing potential output), and/or have lower sales. The empirical analysis in the next
section formally tests this hypothesis.

IV.

General Analysis: The Impact of Depreciations on Firm Performance

This section uses the dataset described in Section III to compare firm performance in countries
with depreciation events versus in countries without depreciation events. More specifically, it

and unrealistic outliers that undoubtedly represent reporting errors. The analysis below addresses this
problem by performing an extensive set of sensitivity tests that includes removing outliers.

Kamin (1988) shows the importance of controlling for the performance of a “comparison group” to
adjust for global industry trends when measuring the impact of devaluations.

examines the impact of depreciations on the growth of firm sales, net income, market
capitalization, and asset value. These results provide the basis for the more detailed analysis in
Section V, which examines how different firm characteristics affect how depreciations impact
firm performance.
The central model for the analysis is:

(1)

Performancei , k ,c,t = α k + β1Depreciationc,t +1 + + β 2 Depreciationc,t
+ β 3 Depreciationc,t −1 + β 4 Inflationc,t + β5Periodt + ξi, k ,c,t

where i is each firm, k is each industry, c is each country, and t is each period (denominated in
years). Performance is a measure of firm performance (discussed in more detail below). Any
time-invariant, industry-specific effects on firm performance are captured by αk, which is
calculated based on 2-digit SIC codes.11 Depreciation is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the
country c where firm i is located experienced a depreciation event (as defined on Table 2) in the
given period. More specifically, Depreciationc,t+1 is equal to 1 if country c had a devaluation in
the following year (t+1); Depreciationc,t is equal to 1 if country c had a devaluation in the current
year (t); and Depreciationc,t-1 is equal to 1 if country c had a devaluation in the previous year (t1). Inflationc,t measures the rate of inflation in country c in period t. Periodt is a vector of period
dummy variables for 1997 through 2000 (with 1996 as the excluded year) and is included to
control for any annual global shocks to firm performance.
Firm performance (Performance) is measured by changes in four variables: sales, net
income, market capitalization and assets.12 Although a single measure of “performance” would be
more straightforward to interpret, each of the four measures is useful in order to capture different
11

The sensitivity analysis tests for the impact of including firm or country effects instead of industry
effects. The base analysis focuses on industry-specific effects, however, since recent empirical analysis has
shown that during this period, sectoral shocks have been large and significant, and even more important
than global and country-specific shocks (Brooks and Del Negro, 2002).

9

aspects of depreciations. For example, an exporter could respond to the relative cost advantage
provided by a depreciation by keeping local currency prices constant and lowering foreign
currency prices, hoping to generate an increase in sales volume. On the other hand, another firm
could respond by keeping foreign currency prices constant and raising local currency prices, so
that export sales remained fairly constant but net income increased.13 Therefore, the impact of the
depreciation on firm performance could be reflected mainly by an increase in sales or an increase
in income (or some combination of the two), and it is necessary to examine changes in both
measures to fully capture the impact of depreciations on firm performance.
Moreover, while changes in sales and net income should capture the short-run impact of
depreciations on firm performance, changes in market capitalization and asset value are more
likely to capture the longer-term impact. Changes in market capitalization should reflect changes
in the discounted value of expected future profits, so that an increase in a firm’s market
capitalization after depreciations should reflect expected improvements in the firm’s longer-term
performance. This measure could be particularly important for firms that respond to depreciations
with additional investment (such as planting crops or digging mines) that may not increase sales
or income for several years. One problem with using market capitalization as a measure of longterm performance, however, is that it assumes markets efficiently reflect new information from
the depreciation. This assumption may not be fully satisfied, especially during crises or in less
liquid emerging markets. Therefore, changes in firm asset value can provide additional
information on the expected longer-term impact of depreciations on firm performance. Firms that
are expected to benefit from depreciations in the long run are more likely to increase assets (such
as purchasing additional machines or even additional plants). Therefore, all four measures of firm
performance are useful in capturing slightly different aspects of how depreciations affect firms in
the short and long run.
12

The firm performance variables are calculated as changes using the equation: (xt-xt-1)/xt-1.

10

Finally, it is useful to compare how depreciations affect both local currency statistics as
well as US dollar statistics, since exchange rate movements could have different effects on
pricing, and therefore various performance measures, for different types of goods. For example, if
a firm produces a non-traded good using only domestic inputs, and holding everything else
constant, a depreciation would have no direct effect on the local currency values of sales, net
income, market capitalization and assets, while the depreciation would cause an immediate
decrease in the US dollar values of the same performance measures. In other words, sales volume
and the local currency value of sales would remain constant, while the US dollar value of sales
would decrease. On the other hand, if a firm produces an export good (such as oil) that is
traditionally priced in US dollars, the same depreciation (again holding everything else constant)
would have no direct effect on the US dollar value of sales (and possibly the other performance
measures) while it would cause an immediate increase in the local currency value of sales (and
possibly the other performance measures). For most goods, depreciations will have an
intermediate effect between these two extreme cases, so it is necessary to consider how
depreciations affect both local currency and US dollar measures of performance.
Table 4 reports random-effects estimates of equation (1) for the four performance
measures in local currency and US dollars. The top section of the table reports coefficient
estimates, and the lower section reports χ2 test statistics for the joint significance of the period
dummy variables and the industry random effects.

<<INSERT TABLE 4 HERE>>

These estimates suggest several key results. First, in the year before a depreciation event,
there is no significant difference between firms in depreciating countries and non-depreciating

13

See Clarida (1997) for an empirical analysis of how US firms balanced these two possible responses to
exchange rate movements in the 1980s.

11

countries for any of the 8 measures of firm performance. Second, when performance is measured
in local currency, firms in depreciating countries tend to have slightly worse performance during
the year of the depreciation than firms in non-depreciating countries, but this difference is usually
not significant. More specifically, the estimated coefficient on Depreciationt is negative when
performance is measured by growth in local currency sales, market capitalization, or assets, but is
only significant at the 10% level for the first variable, and as discussed below, small changes in
model specification often render this coefficient insignificant. Moreover, the magnitude of the
estimated coefficients is fairly small. For example, the –0.10 coefficient in column 1 indicates
that firm sales growth (measured in local currency) during the year of a depreciation was only
10% lower in depreciating countries than in non-depreciating countries.
Third, and in contrast to the above results, firms in depreciating countries appear to have
substantially worse performance during the year of the depreciation when performance is
measured in US dollars. The coefficient on Depreciationt is negative and highly significant for all
four US dollar measures of performance. This difference with the results when performance is
measured in local currency terms, however, undoubtedly reflects the fact that even if real
performance remained constant, the exchange-rate adjustment would generate negative growth in
US dollar terms. For example, the –0.27 coefficient on Depreciationt in column 5 suggests that
firms in depreciating countries experienced sales growth 27% less than firms in non-depreciating
countries. If the US dollar exchange rate had remained constant, this could reflect a 27% decline
in sales volume. On the other hand, this could also reflect constant sales volume, constant local
currency output prices, and a 27% depreciation in the local currency/US dollar exchange rate.
Moreover, in the 12-month period after the initial depreciation, the average currency movement
for the 12 countries in Table 2 was a 32% depreciation. Although currency movements cannot be
directly mapped into changes in US dollar performance measures, these estimates suggest that the
apparent negative impact of depreciations on US dollar measures could largely reflect nominal
movements and not fundamental changes in real performance.

12

A fourth result from Table 4 is that in the year after depreciation events, the impact on
firm performance is mixed. Firms in depreciating countries have significantly lower growth in net
income when measured in local currency. Firms may also have lower growth in net assets when
measured in local currency, although the relevant coefficient is only significant at the 10% level
(and as discussed below this result is not robust to changes in model specification). On the other
hand, firms in depreciating countries have significantly higher growth in market capitalization,
whether measured in local currency or US dollars. If changes in market capitalization are
interpreted as changes in the discounted value of future expected profits, this could suggest that
depreciations improve firms’ expected longer-term profitability. Moreover, the magnitude of the
coefficient estimates suggests that this effect could be economically important. For example,
using the local currency estimates in column 3, in the year after depreciations firm market
capitalization increased by 53% more for firms in depreciating countries than for firms in nondepreciating countries.
The final noteworthy result from Table 4 is the significance of the coefficients other than
the depreciation dummies. The magnitude and significance of the inflation coefficients fluctuate
across specifications. On the other hand, the period dummy variables are jointly highly significant
(in 7 of the 8 specifications) and the industry effects are jointly highly significant in each of the 8
specifications. These results suggest that period- and industry-specific shocks are important
determinants of firm performance.
Next, I estimate a number of variations to the model specified in equation (1) in order to
test for the sensitivity of these results to model specification and outliers. First, I estimate the
model substituting firm effects (αi) for the industry effects (αk). Second, I estimate the model
substituting country effects (αc) instead of the industry effects. Third, I estimate the original
model with industry effects, except use fixed effects instead of random effects to focus on
changes in firm performance within each industry. Fourth, I estimate the model after removing

13

the 10 outliers for each of the performance measures. Fifth and finally, I remove each country
from the sample and re-estimate the base model.
Although the coefficient estimates fluctuate in each of these variations, the central results
do not change.14 In each of these sensitivity tests, the only coefficients on the depreciation
variables that are consistently positive and significant are when performance is measured by
growth in market capitalization (measured in either currency) in the year after depreciations. The
only coefficients that are consistently negative and significant are those when performance is
measured by net income growth (in local currency) in the year after depreciations, and those for
each of the four US dollar performance measures in the year of depreciations. The significance of
the other coefficients fluctuates based on model specification and sample selection. (For example,
when performance is measured by asset growth in local currency, the coefficient on
Depreciationt-1 is insignificant at the 10% level in over 1/3 of the tests.)
To conclude, this analysis has documented several consistent patterns of how
depreciations tend to affect average firm performance. In the year after depreciations, firms in the
depreciating country tend to have significantly higher growth in market capitalization. On the
other hand, firms in depreciating countries tend to have significantly lower growth in net income
(when measured in local currency). Firms in depreciating countries also tend to display worse
performance during the year of the depreciation when performance is measured in US dollars, but
this could largely reflect changes in relative currency values and not significant changes in actual
performance.

V.

The Impact of Depreciations on Performance in Different Types of Firms

The general patterns reported in the last section on how depreciations affect average firm
performance may mask important differences across individual companies. For example,
depreciations may significantly improve the performance of exporters, but negatively impact the

14

performance of firms using a high share of imported inputs. These different effects could
counteract each other when calculating the average impact of depreciations on firms in general.
Therefore, this section examines which firm characteristics determine the impact of depreciations
on firm performance. More specifically, it considers whether output characteristics, foreign sales
exposure, production structure, debt ratios, size, and/or profitability determine the impact of
depreciations on different types of firms.
The empirical specification is an extension of the framework used for the more general
tests in Section IV. More specifically, the estimating equation is the same as equation (1), plus the
relevant test variables (i.e. firm characteristics) interacted with dummy variables indicating
whether there was a depreciation in the current year or previous year:

Performancei , k ,c,t = α k + β1Depreciationc,t +1 + β 2 Depreciationc,t + β 3Depreciationc,t −1
+ β 4 Inflationc,t + β5Periodt + β 6 Depreciationc,t * Test i ,t −1
+ β7 Depreciationc,t −1 * Test i,t −1 + ξi , k ,c,t

(2)

All variables are defined as in equation (1) except Testi,t-1, which is a vector of characteristics for
firm i from the previous period. Testi,t-1 is lagged in order to avoid capturing any impact of the
depreciation on the relevant firm characteristic. These interactive terms are included to test which
firm characteristics determine how depreciations impact firm performance. For example, if one
variable in Testi is a measure of firm size (such as total assets), then the relevant coefficient
estimates in β6 and β7 would capture any additional impact of depreciations on larger firms.
There are a number of firm characteristics that could determine how depreciations affect
firm performance and which should therefore be included in Testi. The base analysis focuses on 6
different variables:

14

Results are not reported since they are so similar to the base results in Table 4.

15

1. Output Characteristics: Theoretical models suggest that one important factor
determining the impact of depreciations is whether a firm produces non-traded goods that only
compete with other domestic producers, or traded goods that compete with foreign producers
(either in domestic markets through competition with imports and/or in foreign markets through
competition as exports). Depreciations should reduce the cost of production for goods in the
depreciating country relative to identical goods produced in non-depreciating countries. This
should give a relative cost advantage to firms that produce traded goods, but no relative cost
advantage to non-traded goods. As a result, depreciations should improve the performance of
firms that produce traded goods relative to firms that produce non-traded goods.15
2. Foreign Exposure: Closely related to the impact of depreciations on traded versus nontraded goods is whether firms had foreign sales before the depreciation. Firms with export
experience are better positioned to benefit from the relative cost advantage of depreciations.
Granted, firms that do not have foreign sales exposure before depreciations could begin operating
abroad after depreciations, but developing international operations can involve substantial time
lags. Therefore, firms with foreign sales would be expected to exhibit better performance directly
after depreciations than firms without foreign exposure.
3. Production Structure: As discussed in the section on traded and non-traded goods,
simple models suggest that depreciations can lower the relative cost of production for firms in the
depreciating country relative to firms in non-depreciating countries. This reduction in relative
production costs will be proportional to the share of domestic inputs (such as labor) in production.
If production involves a higher share of imported inputs, then depreciations will have less impact
on relative production costs.16 In most emerging markets a large fraction of capital is imported, so
that capital/labor ratios can be used as rough proxies for the share of imported inputs to domestic

15

For a model and detailed discussion of these effects, see Agénor and Montiel (1996). Also see Ghei and
Pritchett (1999) for a discussion of factors that could reduce any positive impact of depreciations on traded
goods, especially in developing countries.

inputs in production. Therefore, firms with lower capital/labor ratios are expected to have
relatively better performance after depreciations than firms with higher capital/labor ratios.
4. Debt Ratios: One feature of recent large depreciations, and especially currency crises,
is that they are often accompanied by a contraction in lending and/or increase in interest rates. In
some cases, the contraction in lending is a market response to the capital outflows that generated
the currency depreciation. In other cases, the increase in interest rates is a policy response by the
central bank in order to reduce capital outflows and strengthen the currency’s value. Raising
interest rates could also be required as part of an IMF program. At the firm level, depreciations
can reduce collateral values and therefore raise a company’s cost of borrowing.17 In each of these
cases, the contraction in lending and/or higher interest rates after depreciations would
disproportionately affect firms with higher outstanding debt burdens, as well as those more reliant
on borrowing to finance working capital. Moreover, since many companies borrow in foreign
currency, depreciations would have balance-sheet effects and increase the relative burden of
repaying existing foreign-currency debt.18 For all of these reasons, depreciations would be
expected to have a more negative impact on the performance of firms with higher outstanding
debt ratios.
5. Size: There are a number of channels by which firm size could interact with
depreciations to affect firm performance. First, larger firms are more likely to have access to
financing during lending contractions, which, as discussed above, have frequently occurred
during recent large depreciations. Improved access to financing could occur through informal or
formal networks (such as the Korean chaebol), through government pressure on lending
institutions, and/or through direct bailouts for firms judged “too big to fail”. Second, and possibly
counteracting this effect, although larger firms were more likely to benefit from special networks
or privileges before depreciations, fiscal pressures (or even stricter monitoring as part of an IMF
17

See Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2000).

17

program) may make it more difficult to benefit from these traditional networks after
depreciations. Third, larger firms are more likely to have borrowed in foreign currency and
therefore experience negative balance-sheet effects from depreciations. Fourth, and possibly
counteracting this effect, larger firms are more likely to have hedged against currency risk. For all
of these reasons, larger firms could exhibit better or worse performance than smaller firms after
depreciations, but it is difficult to predict which of these effects dominates a priori.
6. Profitability: The relationship between firm profitability and the impact of
depreciations on firm performance is also difficult to predict a priori. More profitable firms tend
to be operated by more capable managers, who could be better able to adjust production to benefit
from depreciations. Closely related, if depreciations are followed by an output contraction, then
more profitable firms may be better able to withstand the contraction in demand, while less
profitable firms are more likely to go bankrupt. Possibly counteracting this effect, however, more
profitable firms may be operating closer to full capacity and therefore have fewer excess
resources to reallocate and adjust to the depreciation. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether
depreciations will have a positive or negative effect on firms that were more profitable before the
depreciation.
There are obviously a number of firm characteristics other than the six discussed above
that could determine how depreciations affect firm performance. For example, the extent of
hedging against currency risk or the proportion of debt denominated in foreign currency could be
critical. Unfortunately, the firm-level data for these additional tests is not available. The tests for
this analysis were chosen based on a combination of theoretical motivation, anecdotal evidence,
and data availability.
To test for the impact of these six firm characteristics on performance after depreciations,
it is necessary to augment the dataset described in Section III. To test for the importance of traded

18

See Céspedes, Chang and Velasco (2000). Unfortunately, the Worldscope database does not have
sufficient information on foreign-currency borrowing to test this channel directly.

versus non-traded goods, Table 5 lists the different goods produced by firms in the sample by 2digit SIC codes and classifies each group as traded or non-traded. This classification is then used
to create a traded dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if the firm’s main output is a traded
good.19 The other variables are more straightforward to calculate based on the Worldscope data.
Foreign exposure is measured by the ratio of foreign sales to total sales. Capital/labor ratios are
measured by the ratio of total assets (in US dollars) to employees. Outstanding debt is measured
by the ratio of total debt to equity. Firm size is measured by total assets, and firm profitability is
measured by the return on assets. Appendix A provides detailed definitions and summary
statistics for each of these variables. The sensitivity analysis at the end of this section shows that
using different definitions has minimal impact on the central results.

<<INSERT TABLE 5 HERE>>

Table 6 reports regression results based on random effects estimates of equation (2) with
the six variables discussed above included in Testi. When Testi is measured by the traded dummy,
the signs on the coefficient estimates fluctuate and are only significant when performance is
measured by net income growth. Moreover, the significant coefficient estimates are negative, the
opposite of the simple model predictions discussed above.20 When Testi is measured by foreign
sales exposure, however, the results are more consistent across performance measures and agree
with the theoretical predictions. The coefficient estimates on these interaction terms are positive
in 14 of the 16 cases, and are often highly significant. Moreover, the magnitude of the coefficient
estimates suggests that this effect is economically important. Holding everything else constant, if
a firm increased its foreign sales (as a ratio to total sales) by 10%, it would be predicted to

Firms are classified based on the SIC code of their primary output.
This counterintuitive result is analyzed in more detail in the sensitivity tests below.

19

experience growth rates 4% higher in sales, 130% higher in income, and 3% higher in assets (all
measured in local currency) in the year of a major depreciation.

<<INSERT TABLE 6 HERE>>

The coefficient estimates when Testi is measured by capital/labor ratios or debt ratios
provide a less consistent picture. The signs of the coefficient estimates for both sets of results are
fairly evenly split between positive and negative, and the few coefficient estimates that are
significant provide mixed support for the theoretical predictions. For example, in the year after
depreciations, firms with higher capital/labor ratios have significantly lower growth in US dollar
assets (as predicted), but significantly higher growth in local currency sales (the opposite of the
predictions). Firms with higher debt ratios tend to have significantly higher asset growth in the
year of depreciations (the opposite of the predictions), but significantly lower income growth in
the year after depreciations (as predicted). Therefore, this set of results suggests that there is little
strong and consistent relationship between firms’ capital/labor ratios or debt exposure and the
impact of depreciations on firm performance.
When Testi is measured by firm size, all 8 coefficient estimates are negative for the year
of the depreciation, suggesting that larger firms had worse performance in this period. Only 3 of
these coefficients are significant at the 10% level, however, and some of this negative effect of
firm size is reversed in the year after depreciations. Sales growth measured in local currency,
however, is significantly lower for larger firms in the year after depreciations. For the final set of
coefficient estimates, when Testi is measured by profitability, there is no clear pattern. More
profitable firms have significantly higher growth in local currency sales in the year after
depreciations, but this is the only coefficient of the 16 related to the profitability interaction terms
that is significant at the 5% level. Moreover, the signs of the coefficient estimates are fairly
evenly split between positive and negative. Therefore, although larger firms have slightly worse

20

performance than smaller firms after depreciations, profitability appears to have little impact on
how depreciations affect performance.
To analyze the robustness of these central results to changes in variable definition, model
specification, and sample selection, I estimate a number of sensitivity tests. First, I redefine
several different variables: measure foreign exposure using the ratio of foreign assets to total
assets or foreign income to total income (instead of foreign sales to total sales); measure debt
outstanding using total debt to assets or short-term debt to equity (instead of total debt to equity);
measure size using total market capitalization or total income in US dollars (instead of total
assets); or measure profitability using return on equity or return on invested capital (instead of
return on assets). Second, to examine the impact of model specification, I re-estimate the model
substituting firm effects (αi) or country effects (αc) for the industry effects (αk) in equation (2), or
using fixed effects instead of random effects. Then I drop one variable at a time, excluding the
inflation and period dummy variables as well as the interactive terms. Third and finally, I test for
any impact of outliers by removing the 10 extreme values for each of the variables in Testi.
Coefficient estimates fluctuate throughout this series of sensitivity tests, but the key
findings discussed above are robust. Firms with greater foreign sales exposure tend to have
significantly better performance after depreciations (according to most of the performance
variables measured in either currency).21 Firms with higher debt ratios tend to have lower growth
in net income (in either currency), but there is no consistent relationship between debt exposure
and the other performance variables. Larger firms tend to have worse performance than smaller
firms, although the significance of this result fluctuates across performance measures. There
appears to be no consistent relationship between a firm’s profitability or capital/asset ratio and the
impact of depreciations on firm performance. Finally, firms producing traded goods tend to have

21

The one exception to this otherwise robust result is when foreign sales exposure is measured as the ratio
of foreign assets to total assets or the ratio of foreign income to total income (instead of using the ratio of
foreign sales to total sales). In both of these cases, data availability is much more limited and the new
foreign exposure variable is not consistently positive and significant.

21

significantly lower net income growth after depreciations than firms producing non-traded goods,
although this result does not apply for the other performance measures.
In an attempt to better understand this last result, which does not support the simple
model predictions discussed above, I perform two additional tests. I decompose traded goods into
commodities and differentiated goods in order to see if trends in either group are driving the
coefficient estimates.22 Negative shocks to commodity prices that are not captured by the industry
effects could be important, especially since commodities are a major export for many of the
depreciating countries. The right side of Table 5 lists the resulting classifications by two-digit SIC
code. Then I re-estimate equation (2), replacing the traded dummy variable with dummy variables
for commodities and differentiated goods (with non-traded goods continuing to be the excluded
variable).
Results are reported at the top of Table 7. The table only reports coefficient estimates for
the depreciation variables and commodity and differentiated good interaction terms, since the
coefficient estimates for the remaining variables in Testi are virtually identical to those reported
in Table 6. The results suggest that the negative impact of depreciations on income growth for
traded-goods firms occurs in differentiated-goods firms instead of commodity firms. Therefore,
the robust finding of a negative impact of depreciations on income growth for traded-goods firms
does not appear to be caused by movements in commodity prices.

<<INSERT TABLE 7 HERE>>

There are three possible explanations (at least) for why depreciations appear to have a
significant negative impact on income growth for firms producing differentiated goods relative to
firms producing other output. First, since many countries in the sample produce similar products

22

and experienced depreciations around the same time, this may have eroded the relative cost
advantage traditionally provided to traded goods by depreciations. Duttagupta and Spilimbergo
(2000) provide evidence that these “competitive depreciations” were important factors explaining
why the depreciations during the Asian crisis only had a minimal impact on export revenues in
many Asian countries. Second, the demand for differentiated traded goods tends to be more
income elastic than the demand for non-traded goods and commodities. As a result, if
depreciations cause a contraction in income (which occurred in many countries in the sample),
this could generate a greater reduction in demand for differentiated goods relative to other
products.
A final possible explanation is that the positive effect of depreciations on traded goods
predicted by the models is captured in the significant positive coefficients on the foreign exposure
variables. More specifically, the models predict two main channels by which the relative cost
advantage provided to traded goods improves their performance relative to non-traded goods.
First, depreciations lower production costs relative to those of competing imports in the domestic
market. This effect could be minimal, however, if exporters in other countries respond by
lowering prices, and this “pricing-to-market” is more likely to occur in differentiated goods.
Second, depreciations should lower production costs relative to those of competitors in
international markets, leading to an increase in export revenues. Previous empirical work has
shown that the second effect tends to be more important than the first, but this second effect could
already be captured in the regressions by the coefficients on the foreign exposure variables.23
To test for this effect, I re-estimate the base specification in equation (2), but exclude the
foreign exposure variables. Coefficient estimates for the relevant variables are reported at the
22

Commodities are defined as goods that are fairly homogenous across countries, so that prices are set in
global markets. Differentiated goods, on the other hand, are defined as goods that are more heterogeneous
across producers, so that firms have greater power in setting prices.
23
For example, Kamin (1988) finds that most of the impact of devaluations on the trade balance occurs
through the expansion of exports rather than the contraction of imports. Ghei and Pritchet (1999) survey the

23

bottom of Table 7. The coefficient on Tradedt becomes insignificant when performance is
measured by net income growth (in either currency), although the coefficient on Tradedt+1
becomes negative and significant at the 10% level when performance is measured as net income
growth in local currency. Moreover, the coefficients on Tradedt and Tradedt+1 become negative
and borderline significant for other performance measures. Therefore, these results suggest that
some of the estimated impact of depreciations on traded goods compared to non-traded goods
may be captured by the foreign exposure variables in the base specification. When the foreign
exposure variables are removed, however, traded goods still do not exhibit superior performance
to non-traded goods, as predicted by the models, so other factors (such as “competitive
devaluations” or income elasticities of demand) may also be important.

VI.

Conclusions

This paper documents several stylized facts of how recent depreciations affected different
measures of firm performance. It uses a sample of over 13,500 firms from 42 countries to
examine the impact of 12 “major depreciations” between 1997 and 2000. It evaluates firm
performance based on the immediate impact of depreciations on sales and net income, as well as
the expected longer-term impact as measured by changes in market capitalization and asset value.
The first part of the analysis focused on how depreciations affect firms on average. It
finds that in the year after depreciations, firms have significantly higher growth in market
capitalization, suggesting that depreciations increase the present value of firms’ expected future
profits. On the other hand, firms have significantly lower growth in net income (measured in local
currency), suggesting that even if firms benefit from depreciations in the long run, the immediate
impact on performance may be negative. Firms also tend to display worse performance after

empirical literature and do not find strong evidence of a response of imports to exchange-rate movements
in developing countries.

24

depreciations when performance is measured in US dollars, but this could largely reflect changes
in relative currency values and not significant changes in real performance.
The second part of the analysis attempted to identify which firm characteristics
determined the impact of depreciations on individual firm performance. The strongest and most
robust result is that firms with greater foreign sales exposure have significantly better
performance after depreciations (according to most of the performance variables, whether
measured in local currency or US dollars). Firms with higher debt ratios tend to have lower
growth in net income, and larger firms often have worse performance than smaller firms,
although the significance of these results fluctuates across performance measures and model
specification. There is no consistent relationship between a firm’s profitability or capital/asset
ratio and the impact of depreciations on performance. Finally, firms producing traded goods tend
to have significantly lower income growth than firms producing non-traded goods, but this result
is sensitive to the inclusion of the foreign exposure variables and does not apply for the other
performance measures.
Although there are a number of factors other than firm characteristics that determine how
depreciations affect a country’s macroeconomy, these empirical patterns provide some suggestive
evidence of why depreciations can have such varied effects in different countries. The one group
of firms that consistently has superior performance after depreciations, whether measured by
improvements in sales, net income, market capitalization or asset value, was firms with greater
foreign sales exposure. Therefore, relatively open economies with substantial export experience
are more likely to benefit from depreciations, while relatively closed economies with limited
export capacity are more likely to experience an economic contraction.
The empirical results, however, did not find evidence of a robust relationship between
several other firm characteristics, such as capital/labor ratios, and the impact of depreciations on
firm performance. Some of these estimated relationships may be insignificant because it is not
only the firm characteristic that determines the impact of depreciations, but rather the interaction

25

between the firm characteristic and macroeconomic variables (such as inflation, interest rates,
government spending, or changes in the composition of aggregate income). For example, a model
developed in Forbes (2002) suggests that for commodity firms, it is not just capital/labor ratios
that determine how depreciations affect sales growth, but the interaction between capital/labor
ratios and changes in the cost of capital.
Therefore, one promising area for future research is to combine the firm-level evidence
on the impact of depreciations in this paper with the more traditional macro-level research in
previous work. This could involve aggregating the firm-level effects documented in this paper in
order to assess their overall impact at the country level. This could also involve evaluating
whether a country’s firm and industry characteristics or its macroeconomic characteristics are
relatively more important determinants of how depreciations affect aggregate growth. Finally,
this research could also investigate how firm-level factors interact with macroeconomic variables
to determine why some depreciations are expansionary and others are contractionary.
