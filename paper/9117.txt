When Economic Reform Goes Wrong: Cashews in Mozambique

NBER Working Paper No. 9117

JEL No. O10, O50, F10
ABSTRACT
Mozambique liberalized its cashew sector in the early 1990s in response to pressure from the
World Bank. Opponents of the reform have argued that the policy did little to benefit poor cashew
farmers while bankrupting factories in urban areas. Using a welfare-theoretic framework, we analyze the
available evidence and provide an accounting of the distributional and efficiency consequences of the
reform. We estimate that the direct benefits from reducing restrictions on raw cashew exports were of
the order $6.6 million annually, or about 0.14% of Mozambique GDP. However, these benefits were
largely offset by the costs of unemployment in the urban areas. The net gain to farmers was probably no
greater than $5.3 million, or $5.30 per year for the average cashew-growing household. Inadequate
attention to economic structure and to political economy seems to account for these disappointing
outcomes.

WHEN ECONOMIC REFORM GOES WRONG: CASHEWS IN MOZAMBIQUE
1. Introduction
In a case that has become a cause celebre for the anti-globalization movement, the World
Bank prevailed on Mozambique’s government in the early 1990s to liberalize the cashew sector
and to remove restrictions on exports of raw cashews. The Bank hoped that resources would be
allocated more efficiently and the incomes of cashew farmers would be boosted. The policy was
met with fierce opposition from the domestic cashew-processing industry, which ironically had
just been privatized. After a decade of political strife, international controversy, and ongoing if
hesitant reform, the consequences remain hotly contested. Each side in the debate has its
favorite statistics: the World Bank points to the rise in farmgate prices, while its opponents point
to the processing plants in urban areas which have been shut down and the thousands of workers
that remain unemployed.
Historically, the cashew sector has constituted a significant part of Mozambique’s
economy, providing income to several million individuals across the country. In the 1960s,
Mozambique produced as much as half of the world’s total. The sector went into a long decline
thereafter, as a combination of adverse policies and civil war (1982-1992) brought new tree
plantings to a halt. Following independence in 1975, the government had banned the export of
raw cashew nuts to stimulate domestic processing. Mozambique became the first African
country to process cashews on a large scale. By 1980, the country had 14 processing factories.
Following World Bank advice, the government began to loosen restrictions on raw cashew
production in the late 1980s. The ban on exporting raw cashews was lifted in 1991/92 and
replaced with an export quota and export tax. The quota was subsequently removed, and the
export tax on raw nuts came down from 60% in 1991/92 to 14% in 1998/99.
From the vantage point of textbook economics, the analysis of the export restriction and
its removal is a straightforward exercise. A ban (or tax) on exports depresses the domestic price
of raw cashews, effectively subsidizing the domestic processors for whom raw cashews is the
chief input. The policy results in an inefficient allocation of resources: raw cashew production is
discouraged, and labor and capital are pulled into cashew processing where, absent externalities,
their social value marginal product is lower than in other activities. The relaxation of the
restrictions is therefore expected to create a double benefit. First, an efficiency gain, arising
from the reversal of the adverse resource pulls mentioned above. And second, a distributional
gain, resulting from the rise in farmgate prices for the poorest households in Mozambique. This
is the sort of analysis that underlies, for example, Paul Krugman’s (2000) New York Times
column on the subject, which took the anti-World Bank crowd to task for overlooking the propoor bias of the export liberalization.
As we shall show in this paper, many of the textbook implications of export liberalization
were indeed realized. Farmgate prices rose, raw cashew exports increased, and resources were
pulled out of cashew processing. However, even under the most favorable assumptions, the
magnitude of the benefits generated by these effects were quite small—both in economic terms
and in relation to the amount of time and energy that Mozambique’s government spent on this
question over the years. We estimate that the efficiency gains generated by the removal of the
export restrictions could not have amounted to more than $6.6 million annually, or about 0.14%

2
of Mozambique GDP. The additional income accruing to the farmers was probably no greater
than $5.3 million, or $5.30 per year for the average cashew-growing household. These are puny
amounts for a policy that was a key plank in the World Bank’s reform agenda, and that became a
serious bone of contention between the Bank and Mozambique, requiring the personal attention
of both of their presidents.
Moreover, small as they are, these numbers overstate the benefits involved. The standard
gains from the liberalization have to be set against the efficiency losses that have resulted from
the idling of processing plants. In theory, the workers employed in these plants should have
found alternative sources of employment after a reasonable time, perhaps suffering some wage
losses in the process. In reality, a large number seems to have remained unemployed, perhaps
because of the expectation that the liberalization would be eventually reversed. One account
claims that 90% of the sector’s 11,000 workers were unemployed in 2001. Even if we take a
fraction of this number, the loss in real output (equivalently, loss of real income of workers) that
is involved is of the order of $6.1 million, or 0.12% of GDP. Note that this amount is roughly
equivalent to the direct efficiency gain generated by the liberalization (as noted above). In all
likelihood, therefore, the aggregate static gains produced by the liberalization were a wash.
These disappointing outcomes are due in part to wrinkles that the textbook analysis sets
aside. First, there are complications that arise from imperfect market structures. We highlight
two of those in the analysis below. Domestically, there are several layers of intermediaries that
separate cashew farmers from the export trade, creating a situation analogous to doublemarginalization in the analysis of vertical relationships in industrial organization. The chief
implication of this is that we cannot expect increases in export prices to be passed one-for-one on
to the farmers. The pass-through coefficient is much smaller than unity—more of the order of
40-50%--reducing the gains that accrue to the poorest households. In other words, traders
capture much of the benefits from the liberalization. Externally, we have the complication that
the world market for raw cashew is significantly less competitive than that for processed cashew.
In effect, India is a monopsony buyer of raw cashew from Mozambique. Mozambique’s
transformation from an exporter of processed cashews to an exporter of raw cashews can be
expected therefore to produce a terms-of-trade loss for the country, which diminishes both the
efficiency and distributional gains from liberalization.
The real hope for the liberalization strategy might, and should, have been placed on the
dynamic effects. We emphasize two dynamic consequences in particular. First, the
liberalization could have reinvigorated the rural sector over the medium- and long-run by
reversing the dramatic collapse in cashew tree planting. Second, in the urban sector it could have
heralded a restructuring of production by promoting a more rational investment pattern. The key
in both instances was a credible commitment to a new pricing regime—possibly complemented
with compensatory programs—that would have made it worthwhile for farmers, entrepreneurs,
and workers to undertake investments that would be at least in part irreversible. The main failing
of the cashew liberalization policy, in our view, was that it did not send sufficiently credible
signals about the pricing regime. The result was that farmers refused to plant trees, cashew
processors refused to take their resources elsewhere, and urban workers refused to look for other
jobs. Had these adjustments taken place instead, the static losses would have been minimized,
while the efficiency gains would have grown over time.

3

The Mozambique cashew story illustrates several themes that have become increasingly
central in the analysis of reform. One theme has to do with the importance of credibility and the
need for expectations management. The supply responses that will make reform successful are
likely to be forthcoming only when there is sufficient credibility attached to the change in the
policy regime. That in turn requires creative thinking on credibility enhancing mechanisms as an
integral part of reform. The second theme is that reform is a “political” problem as well as a
“technical” one. Had the political opposition of the urban groups been anticipated, or factored
in, compensatory mechanisms and side bargains could have been worked out beforehand. Third,
policy reform via conditionality is rarely conducive to desirable outcomes. The credibility
problems noted above were created in part because the liberalization of the cashew sector was
viewed as a “World Bank policy”—something that the government was doing not because it was
a priority but because it was required to qualify for World Bank (and IMF) lending. Not having
full ownership of the reform, the government was poor at selling it.
There are also implications for the acrimonious turn that the debate on globalization has
taken of late. We have little doubt that most of the activists that have attacked the World Bank
over its handling of the Mozambique cashew issue have their hearts in the right place. But few
have carefully scrutinized the question that one would think they would have been most
interested in: are the poorest farmers getting a better price for their product, and are they better
off as a result? But the economists are not without blame either. They have relied on a priori
generalizations and textbook expositions instead of figuring out what has really transpired on the
ground.
Beyond Mozambique are there also implications for the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA), where 75% of the labor force still depends entirely on agriculture for its livelihood?
Recent evidence suggests that—as in Mozambique—the supply response to price liberalization
throughout most of SSA has been disappointing (UNCTAD, 1998). Over-reliance on price
reforms is likely to be one reason for this. Most policymakers would agree that price and nonprice incentives are both important determinants of supply. In practice however, it is price
reforms that have been carried out most often. It is far easier to stop regulating producer prices
than it is to remove structural constraints like poor roads, lack of access to credit, or monopsony
power on the part of domestic traders. The problem with price reforms is that they can be also
reversed with the stroke of a pen. As our analysis of Mozambique suggests, a significant supply
response is unlikely unless there is a sharp break in farmers' expectations about the future. Since
non-price reforms are harder to reverse, they may be more effective in increasing the expected
profitability of investment from the farmers' point of view, thus eliciting the elusive supply
response.
The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 provides a capsule history of the cashew
industry and of recent developments. Section 3 presents an analytical framework and a
decomposition of the welfare effects of cashew liberalization into various channels. In section 4,
we provide quantitative estimates of the efficiency and distributional implications of the
liberalization. Sections 5 and 6 deal with domestic and international market structure
complications, respectively. Section 7 focuses on the domestic processing industry and presents
estimates of the unemployment loss. Section 8 speculates on the reasons behind the

4
disappointing supply response. Section 9 concludes. A synopsis of the debate surrounding the
case is presented in Appendix A.
2. History of cashew industry and background1
Cashew production has been extremely important to Mozambique throughout much of
the 20th century.2 The Portuguese promoted cashew cultivation during the colonial period and
by the 1960s Mozambique had established itself as the world leader in cashew production.
Shortly after Mozambique gained independence from Portugal, cashew production went into a
long period of decline (as illustrated in Figure 1). Cashew production is still depressed in spite of
efforts to revive the sector. Nevertheless, cashew remains one of Mozambique’s leading exports
and a source of income to more than one million peasant farm families or approximately 5
million people.
Mozambique’s early success in the production of raw nuts was accompanied by a boom
in its cashew processing industry (see Figure 1). Mozambique became the first African country
to process cashews on an industrial scale as small, manual processing systems were replaced by
large, mechanized factories (Deloitte and Touche, 1997). The first industrial plant was
established in 1950 and two decades later there were 14 processing factories with a total
processing capacity of approximately 150,000 tonnes of raw nuts. Processing of cashew peaked
in 1973 when 149,800 tonnes of cashew were processed for export. Since this time, the industry
has declined dramatically and in 1999/00 Mozambique processed a total of only 8,000 tonnes of
raw cashew (INCAJU, 2001).
In an attempt to stem the decline in processed cashew exports, the Mozambican
government banned the export of raw cashew in 1978. But in 1982, a decade long civil war
broke out and - as illustrated in Figure 1 – this long period of political turmoil took a toll on both
cashew production and processing. Cashew production peaked in 1973 at 240,000 tonnes and has
never since achieved that level. At the same time, world cashew production increased steadily
and by the late seventies Mozambique had lost its dominant position in cashew production to
India and Brazil. By 1989/90, Mozambique produced only 22,106 tonnes (INCAJU 2001) and its
share of world raw cashew nut production had dropped to 5% (Desai, 2001a). Since that time,
the range of cashew production has become much smaller, fluctuating only between 22,106 and
66,510 tonnes.
Even during its most successful years, the cashew industry in Mozambique has been
highly regulated. Prior to independence, the Portuguese government established producer prices
and marketing margins throughout the cashew marketing chain (Tarp, 1990)3. During the post1

Appendix B provides a detailed timeline of the events surrounding the cashew industry since 1950.
The cashew tree is not indigenous to Mozambique, but was initially imported from Brazil by Portuguese colonists
in the 16th century (Nomisma, 1994). The tree is well-suited to the Mozambican climate, particularly in the northern
region of the country. Beginning in the 1930s, cashew cultivation in Mozambique expanded dramatically, primarily
on small and medium scale African farms (Newitt, 1995).

The prices for traders and producers were based on the world kernel price and the domestic industry’s processing
costs rather than the world price for raw cashew nuts in order to ensure that the processing factories could remain
competitive in the processed cashew market. According to Deloitte and Touche (1997), the producer price was 50%
of the government-established factory gate price. Of the traders’ 50% margin, 15% was allocated to the retailer and
35% to the wholesaler.

colonial period, Frelimo (The Front for Liberation of Mozambique) continued to regulate the
cashew industry. Around the time raw cashew exports were banned, the State Secretariat of
Cashew (SSC), the central body controlling the cashew industry, and Caju de Moçambique, the
holding company for the state-owned processing factories, were established (Nomisma, 1994).
During the colonial period, internal marketing was performed primarily by Portuguese or
Asian traders. Like producer prices, traders’ margins were highly regulated. As a result, the
marketing system was very stable. However, according to Tarp (1990), with Independence in
1975, the existing marketing system broke down as most of the Portuguese traders or
“cantineiros” left the country and the Asian traders migrated to urban areas and gave up trading
activities. Consequently, the cashew export trade was brought under control of ENACOMO, a
state trading company, although private traders continued to act as buying agents (Jaffee, 1995
and Tarp, 1990). Producer prices and trading margins continued to be established by the
government and—as previously mentioned—a ban on exporting raw cashews was imposed.
Relaxation of government control of the cashew sector began in the late 1980s when
Mozambique entered into its first structural adjustment program with the World Bank.4 This
program (the 1987-1990 Economic Rehabilitation Program or ERP) was aimed at decreasing
overall administrative controls in order to restore market incentives to promote production and
trade (Tarp, 1990). While it was not specifically focused on the cashew industry, it covered the
cashew sector along with other products and sectors of the economy (Pomerantz, 2001b). Among
other things, the program called for a substantial increase in the government-established
producer price and the establishment of the minimum producer price system that was
implemented in the early 1990s.
In its 1995 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Report, the World Bank required
Mozambique to liberalize cashew marketing and exporting in order to satisfy the “base case”
conditions and qualify for approximately $400 million of loan assistance (World Bank, 1995a).5
However, according to the World Bank’s former Mozambique Country Director Phyllis
Pomerantz, there was no specific “conditionality” (Pomerantz, 2001a). In addition to
recommending that Mozambique liberalize cashew marketing, the World Bank also
recommended as a subsequent step that it privatize the processing industry. According to
Pomerantz (2001a), the government did not follow this advice and privatized the industry before
it liberalized cashew marketing.
The World Bank’s advice to liberalize Mozambique’s cashew industry was based on a
1995 report by Hilmar Hilmarsson, a World Bank consultant (Pomerantz, 2001a and
Arulpragasam, 2001). This report was included as a chapter in the 1995 World Bank Report
entitled, “Mozambique: Impediments to Industrial Sector Recovery” (World Bank, 1995b).6
Based on the comparison with other countries and the technology employed, the chapter

4

Mozambique became a member of the Bretton Woods Institutions in 1984.
The World Bank’s proposed lending program for FY96-00 included low and base scenarios. Liberalizing the
cashew industry was a condition for the latter, in which it would receive a loan package of $665 million. Under the
former, the loan package would be reduced to $240 million.

concluded that the Mozambican processing industry, as structured in 1994, was unviable (World
Bank, 1995b). It assumed that liberalization would increase the producer share of the FOB price
to 50-70% and increase cashew production, export value, and farmers’ income, as illustrated in
Table 1. While the report outlined several policies for improving cashew production and
increasing producers’ incomes, the World Bank focused on eliminating the export tax on raw
cashews. According to World Bank official Johannes Zutt, the World Bank’s strategy in
advising the Government to eliminate the export tax was to “increase the poverty reducing
potential of the cashew industry in Mozambique…and this was one of the few pro-poor things
the World Bank could implement at the time” (Zutt, 2001). According to former World Bank
Country Director Pomerantz, the World Bank hoped that there would be sufficient competition at
the marketing level to ensure that reducing the export tax would increase the export price and
therefore the producer price.
While the Bank and the government agreed that liberalization and privatization were
appropriate, they disagreed on the extent and the time horizon for the liberalization. The Bank
favored immediate and complete elimination of the tax, while the industry favored a gradual,
partial reduction in the tax (World Bank, 2000a). Table 2 illustrates the different proposals, the
schedule agreed by the government and the World Bank, and the actual tax rates implemented.
We discuss some of the specific reforms below.
Price reforms
In 1991/92, the export ban on raw cashew nuts was lifted and limited quantities of raw
nuts were allowed to be exported. However, a 60% tax on the difference between the FOB and
factory gate prices and a quantitative restriction of 10,000 tonnes were imposed (Desai, 2001).
In 1992/93, the tax (on the difference between the FOB and factory gate prices) was lowered to
30%, but the quantitative restriction was maintained at 10,000 tonnes. In 1993/94, the export tax
was maintained, but the quantitative restriction was loosened. While the initial export quota
remained fixed at 10,000 tonnes, additional quantities were auctioned off in 5,000-tonne lots to
registered exporters. In 1994/95, the quantitative restriction was lifted and the export tax was
reduced to 20% of the FOB value in 1995/96 and then 14% in 1996/97 and 97/98 (Deloitte and
Touche, 1997 and Desai, 2001a). Faced with domestic opposition to the reductions of the export
tax, Mozambique’s parliament passed a bill in 1999 that increased the tax to between 18 and
22%, the exact amount to be determined each year, depending on market conditions. (EIU,
March 2000). In both the 1999/00 and 2000/01 seasons, the export tax was 18% (Desai, 2001a).
Producer prices were significantly increased in 1987/88 from 10 Meticais/kg to 105
Meticais/kg. Also at this time, the government announced that a minimum producer price would
replace the fixed producer price as the liberalization program progressed (Tarp, 1990). As
illustrated in Figure 2, the government continued to significantly increase the minimum producer
price throughout the 1990s until 1998/99 when it was fully liberalized. During this period, there
was near parity between the actual nominal producer price and the government-established
minimum price. During the period of the export ban, the government also fixed the "factory gate
price" or the price processors paid for their raw nuts. Government control over prices paid by
the processing industry for raw nuts were eliminated at the time of privatization, 1991.
Marketing reforms

7
Liberalization of the cashew industry also led to significant changes in the marketing
system. The state trading company, ENACOMO, was privatized in the late 1980s. Additional
marketing channels opened in 1991/92 when the ban on exporting raw cashews was lifted.
According to the current Mozambique Country Economist for the World Bank, Peter Moll, the
rationing arrangement for export licenses was eliminated. Under that rationing arrangement,
individuals had been required to apply for export licenses and one of the criteria for obtaining a
license was that the individual “had previously been a recipient of such a license” (Moll, 2001).
Exporters are, however, still required to be licensed by the State Secretariat of Cashew (Desai,
2001a).
Privatization
Privatization of Caju de Mozambique—the holding company of the state-owned
processing factories—began in 1991 when a privatization unit (UTRE) was created within the
Ministry of Finance (World Bank, 1995b). By the end of 1994, all of the formerly state-owned
factories had been privatized. As shown in Table 3, the majority of factories were sold to local
entrepreneurs and not to foreign investors (as suggested by Krugman, 2000). In 1995, the only
disappointing aspect of the privatization appeared to be the revenue generated. According to
Deloitte and Touche (1997) the factories were all sold at below asking price and payments made
totalled $850 thousand (compared with the $13.5 million the government had asked for).
Between 1995 and 1998 six new factories were established, with an installed capacity of 8,950
tonnes and full-capacity employment of approximately 1,200 workers.7 These newer factories
supply the domestic and regional market, and not the traditional international market.8
The fact that the government privatized the factories under a regime of protection and
subsequently began to remove that protection put the industry up in arms. On James
Wolfensohn’s first visit to Mozambique in 1997, he was approached by angry industrialists who
claimed that the World Bank was responsible for the problems the industry was having procuring
raw cashew. Wolfensohn responded by authorizing another study of the cashew industry in
Mozambique (Deloitte and Touche, 1997), which came out in favor of protecting the processing
factories for some period of time. Subsequently, at least two additional studies have been
commissioned by the government, also paid for by the World Bank. Abt Associates performed a
third analysis of the processing industry (Abt Associates, 1999) and Jaikishan Desai performed
an analysis of cashew farmers (Desai, 2001a).
3. A Simple Analytical Framework
We present here a simple conceptual framework to facilitate the evaluation of the
liberalization. The framework tracks the incomes of the following distinct groups: (i) raw
cashew producers (farmers); (ii) traders and other intermediaries; (iii) owners of the cashew
processing factories; (iv) workers employed in the factories; and (v) the government.
Raw cashew producers face the farmgate price p1 and produce both for home
consumption and for the market. We denote own consumption by z and the marketed production
by q. Since total output is q+z, total costs are given by c(q+z). Farmers also consume an

Cabo Caju is an exception to this domestic and regional focus. It has a contract to supply Delta Café, an
international distributor.

8
“outside good” z’, whose price we fix to unity. Let farmers have the quasi-linear utility function
given by uf = u(z, z’) = z’ + v(z). They select z, q, and z’ by maximizing this subject to the
budget constraint p1q = z’ + c(q+z). Substituting the budget constraint into the utility function,
the farmers’ utility can also be expressed as uf = v(z) + p1q - c(q+z), which is an expression
involving only z and q. We shall use this expression below to summarize cashew growers’
welfare. The associated first-order conditions are v’ = c’ and p1 = c’.
The world (FOB) price of raw cashew is p*, and the after tax FOB price is p*(1-t).
Domestic intermediaries earn the rents that arise between the farmgate price and the after tax
FOB price, [p*(1-t) - p1]q. Domestic processors use raw cashew and labor to produce processed
cashews for the world market. Let P* and w stand for the world price of processed cashews and
the wage earned by factory workers, respectively. Then the profits of the domestic processors
∂π
=
can be expressed using the profit function π( P*, w, p*(1-t)), with the standard properties:
∂P *
∂π
∂π
X (total supply or exports of processed cashew), = l (labor demand), and - *
= qd
∂w
∂p (1 − t )
(input demand for raw cashew nuts). Exports of raw cashew (x) are the difference between the
total marketed supply and the demand from domestic processors: x = q – qd.
Urban workers earn the wage bill wl. We let wo denote the social opportunity cost of
their labor. If unemployment is their next best alternative, wo will be approximately zero. The
social surplus generated by employment in the domestic processing industry is therefore given
by (w – w0)l.
We are now ready to express the total social surplus generated by the cashew industry,
which is the sum total of the incomes that accrue to each of these groups (plus the government,
which receives export tax revenues). We write this as follows:
(1)

U = π( P*, w, p*(1-t)) + (w – w0)l + [p*(1-t) - p1]q + [v(z) + p1q – c(q + z)] + tp*x

The five terms on the right hand side represent owners of the processing factories, urban
workers, traders/intermediaries, cashew growers, and the government respectively. Note that
since π( P*, w, p*(1-t)) = P*X – wl - p*(1-t)qd,, this expression can also be written as
(2)

U = (P*X - p*qd) – w0l + p*q + v(z) – c(q+z).

This shows that the total surplus consists of value added in the processing industry at world
prices (the term in parentheses) net of the social opportunity costs of the labor employed there,
plus the total value added generated by the raw cashew sector (again at world prices). We
emphasize that this framework is perfectly general; in particular, it can handle the possibility that
the processing factories were generating negative value added at world prices (as some observers
have claimed), in which case the first term on the right-hand side would be negative, but
otherwise the analysis would remain unchanged.

9
Consider now a small perturbation that arises, say, from a change in the export tax t.
Differentiating equation (1) totally, rearranging terms, and simplifying,9 we get the following
expression:

dU

(export-quantity effect) [1]

+ ( w − w0 )

dl

+ [p*(1-t) – p1]

(unemployment effect) [3]
dq
.
dt

(traders’ margin effect) [4]

The welfare change associated with the reduction in t can be decomposed into the four
components shown above. First, we have the standard efficiency gain arising from the increase
in the quantity of raw cashew exports (channel [1]). Since the export restriction artificially
represses such exports, a reduction in t enhances welfare insofar as it spurs exports of raw
cashew nuts (i.e., as long as dx/dt <0). In the absence of any other market distortions, policyimposed or otherwise, this would be the only operative channel and the only term on the righthand side.
The remaining three terms capture additional complications that are relevant to the
Mozambique case. The terms-of-trade effect (channel [2]) tracks the possibility that increased
exports of raw cashew may depress the FOB price received by the exporters (dp*/dt > 0). While
Mozambique has only a small share of the world market for raw cashews, it faces a monopsony
buyer in India. (India or any other country does not have similar market power vis-à-vis
Mozambique in processed cashew. Therefore we have assumed dP*/dt = 0.) We shall discuss
this issue further in section 6.
The possible unemployment costs of the liberalization are depicted in the third term on
the right-hand side (channel [3]). As long as there is a gap between wage earnings in the
processing industry and the social opportunity cost of employing labor, a reduction in factory
employment associated with the reduction in the export restriction (dl/dt > 0) is welfare reducing.
(Of course, the framework does not rule out the possibility that these losses are more than offset
by the income gains that result from reorienting raw cashews to export markets.)
Finally, channel [4] is the consequence of imperfect competition at home, namely the
bargaining leverage that traders and other intermediaries may have on cashew growers. This
leverage creates a gap between the after tax FOB price of raw cashew and the farmgate price.
The cost is an undersupply of raw cashew to the market. The (partial) undoing of this as a result

first-order conditions associated with utility and profit maximization.

10
of the reduction in the export restriction represents an independent source of efficiency gain for
the economy (dq/dt < 0).
These effects relate to the aggregate efficiency costs and benefits, and sweep aside
distributional outcomes. In other words, all the components of income are weighted equally in
the overall balance sheet. However, the impact on farmers is of particular concern, as a key
objective of the liberalization policy was to reduce poverty in rural areas. To trace the effect of
the policy on farmers, we can use the expression developed above for farmers’ utility: uf = v(z) +
p1q - c(q+z). From the envelope theorem, duf/dt = q(dp1/dt). This represents the standard result
that the cashew growers become better off when the farmgate price of raw cashews rises (dp1/dt
< 0), and that the increase in their welfare is proportional to the net quantity supplied to the
market. Note that the benefits are proportional to the commercialized part of cashew
production—not the total harvest.
We shall discuss each of these effects in greater detail below, presenting evidence on the
extent to which the channels in question were operative. We shall also provide, where possible,
some rough estimates of the quantitative magnitudes involved (using non-infinitesimal versions
of the expressions above). In particular, section 4 provides an estimate of the aggregate effect of
channels [1], [2], and [4], while section 7 provides an estimate for channel [3]. Sections 5 and 6
provide a more extended discussion on the likely significance of domestic and external imperfect
competition (channels [2] and [4]).
4. Evaluating the Efficiency Gains from Reducing Export Restrictions
The policy environment surrounding the cashew industry has evolved significantly since
the liberalization process began in 1987. Controls on raw cashew exports have been gradually
removed. The government no longer fixes producer prices or factory gate prices. More traders
have been licensed and the state-owned cashew factories have been privatized. In what follows,
we evaluate and estimate the direct efficiency gains and distributional consequences associated
with these reforms.

Results of these reforms have so far been mixed. The real producer price nearly doubled
between 1990/91 and 1999/00, but then dropped sharply in 2000/01 to its lowest level since
1994/95. As Figure 3 shows, the producers’ share of the FOB price also increased throughout the
1990s. But in spite of the increase in producer prices, the supply response has been weak and
sporadic (see Figure 1). Average output since the time price reforms began has increased relative
to the previous decade but only by around 10,000 tonnes – half the 20,000 tonnes envisaged in
the World Bank’s base case scenario. As for exports, the quantity of raw cashews exported
peaked in 1995/96 at 35,320 tonnes.
What about new planting? Cashew is a perennial and Mozambique's cashew trees are
reported to be old and in need of replacement. Perhaps farmers have been planting new trees and
it is just a matter of time before we observe a vigorous supply response. However, this does not
seem to be the case. Less than one quarter of all households are reported to have planted any
new cashew trees, and among these households the average number of new trees planted was 3.6
(Desai 2001a). This puts new plantings at roughly one million trees per year, just enough to
replace the reported one million trees that die each year (AIM, April 19, 2001). At this rate,

11
Mozambique’s cashew orchard will never be as it was in the early 1970s when 45 million trees
were reported to be productive.10
One important bit of evidence related to the supply response is the fact that farmers
appear to retain a fairly large proportion of cashew for home consumption. A great deal of
uncertainty exists regarding the difference between the quantity of raw nuts produced and
commercialized. Deloitte and Touche (1997) estimates that 70% to 90% of raw cashews are
commercialized and that the remainder is retained for domestic consumption. Regional
differences contribute to the uncertainty regarding overall raw cashew production and
commercialization. Desai (2001a) found that about 85% of farmers in the province of Nampula
sell some part of their harvest, and that only about 64% of what they harvest is commercialized.
In the southern provinces of Inhambane and Gaza, he found a different pattern: only 14% and
29% of harvested cashews are commercialized in these two provinces respectively. Furthermore,
in Inhambane, less than one-third of cashew producers sell any part of their harvest, and in Gaza,
only about 47% market any of their harvest. The fact that cashew serves both as a food crop and
as a cash crop has important implications for the poverty impact of export liberalization: it
indicates that the positive income effect of an increase in raw cashew prices on farmers is
substantially smaller than it would have been with full commercialization of the harvest (as
shown analytically in the previous section).
Marketing seems to have become more competitive. The number of exporters has more
than tripled from 3 in 1990/91 to 11 in 1996/97 (Deloitte and Touche, 1997).11 In addition, it
appears that a number of informal or unlicensed traders began operating. Prior to the
liberalization, the trading system was characterized by more formal, established relations in
which farmers sold raw nuts at trading posts to licensed traders. The trader generally had a
relationship with a factory or larger traders to whom he would sell the raw nuts. During this
period, supply chain credit was common (Owen, 2001). Following liberalization, the marketing
system became more competitive and supply chain credit became less common. Producers
increasingly traded with itinerant, informal traders who move into the rural areas earlier in the
season and buy in smaller quantities at producers’ households. The formal traders have objected
to the informal traders who are unlicensed and therefore avoid paying taxes (Owen, 2001).
Although farmers are earning more and output has risen, these results are disappointing
and certainly fall short of World Bank projections. The Bank's study of the cashew industry
indicated expectations that under the worst case scenario (see Table 1) liberalization of cashew
marketing would allow farmers to earn $0.38/kg for raw nuts (50% of the projected FOB price),
which would increase supply by 20,000 tonnes (to 54.3 from a base of 35 thousand tonnes) and
raise farmers' incomes to six times their level at the time of the study or $24.5 million. In
practice, the average price actually received by farmers since the ban was lifted has been
$0.27/kg (40% of the annual average FOB price over 91/92-00/01). Average annual marketed
output since the ban was lifted amounts to 44,300 tonnes or roughly 10,000 tonnes more than the
annual average in the previous decade (during which the ban was in effect and the country was at
civil war). Marketed output still remains much lower than its level immediately following
10

Replanting is reported to have stopped somewhere around 1965 and current estimates put the stock of trees around
27 million (Nomisma 1994, Desai 2001).
11
More recent estimates put the number of exporters at between 8 and 10 (Matule, 2001).

12
independence (approximately 90,000 tonnes). Average annual income earned by farmers from
selling raw cashew since the export ban was lifted amounts to $13 million (only half the amount
used in the World Bank’s worst case medium-term scenario). This compares with an annual
average income earned by farmers during the period of the civil war (1982-1992) of $7.0
million. In addition, over the last two seasons, the nominal farmgate price has dropped by more
than 50% (from $0.45/kg to $0.20/kg) and in 2000/01 the real farmgate price was no higher than
it was during the last year in which the ban was in effect.
To gauge the overall impact of these reforms on the economy of Mozambique, we
compute rough estimates of the net economic-surplus gains associated with these reforms, using
observed levels of prices and quantities. We make several assumptions in developing our
estimates. We assume that had the ban remained in effect, processors would have continued to
pay traders no more than 40% of the FOB price for raw cashew. This is a very conservative
estimate and is based on the original World Bank study of the cashew sector in Mozambique
which states that "the factory gate price has also remained low, at about 40 percent of the border
price, as traders must first sell the raw nuts to local factories at a "negotiated" price, with the
government acting as a referee" (World Bank, 1995b). We also assume that had the ban
remained in effect, the quantity of marketed raw cashew would have remained equal to the
annual average of marketed surplus during the period of the civil war or 35,000 tonnes. For
post-reform prices and quantities, we use the observed averages for the period 1991/92 through
2000/01. Specifically, we take $671 and $584 as the FOB and after-tax FOB prices of raw
cashew, respectively. The quantities of raw nuts processed and marketed are 21,500 and 44,300,
respectively.
To compute the increase in farmer surplus, we assume that had the ban remained in place,
farmers would have received no more than 20% of the FOB price for raw cashew. Again, this is
a conservative estimate based on a trader's margin of 50% and the ability of the trader to obtain
40% of the FOB price from the factory. At the time the ban was lifted, farmers received
approximately 25% of the FOB price and they currently receive 45% of the FOB price (see data
table in Appendix C). As before, we use the data in Appendix C to compute annual averages of
observed prices and quantities for the period 91/92-00/01. A graphical representation of our
calculations is provided in Figure 4.
We can approximate the standard efficiency gain from the removal of the ban with the
sum of the areas ibc and mnib in Figure 4, the latter being the tax revenue that accrues to the
government. This yields $5.57 million (=0.5*[584-269]*[44.3-21.5]+[671-584]*[44.3-21.5]).
Of this, $1.98 million is government revenue. Note that this $5.57 million figure captures both
of the channels [1] and [2] discussed in the previous section, insofar as any induced reduction in
the FOB price is already reflected in the observed post-ban average price of 671. To this
number, we must then add the additional income that accrues to domestic traders/exporters due
to the margin between the after tax FOB price and the farmgate price (see channel [4]). This gap
is shown in the Figure as the difference between the “supply” curve of the traders/exporters and
the marginal cost schedule of farmers. The relevant area is cbfg, which is approximately equal to
$2.14 million (=0.5*134*9.5+0.5*315*9.5). Of course, not all of this gap is pure profits or rents.
We assume that half of it represents real resource costs (transport, wastage and other real
expenses). So we add half of the area cbfg to the number above, for a total efficiency gain (net

13
of unemployment costs) of $5.57 + $1.07 = $6.64 million, or 0.14% of Mozambique’s GDP in
2000.
How much of the surplus generated by the liberalization do the farmers get? The total
surplus accruing to the farmers, traders, and exporters of raw nuts is approximately equal to
$13.51 million--the increase in the price times an average of ban and post-ban quantities (or
[584-269][44+35]*0.5 = $12.44 million) plus one half the traders’ margin ($1.07 million). Of
this only a part goes to the farmers themselves. The change in farmer surplus associated with the
removal of the ban is approximately equal to the increase in the producer price times an average
of ban and post-ban quantities. The resulting annual average increase in producer surplus for
farmers amounts to $5.29 million--([268-134]*[35+44]*0.5)--or roughly $5.29 per cashew
growing household per year. This is less than four days’ wages at the minimum Mozambican
wage of $1.65 per day.
The result that the gains to farmers are so small, despite our generous assumption that
farmgate prices have doubled, is the product of two factors. First, raw cashew production is and
remains quite depressed, relative to historic norms. Second, farmers retain part of their harvest
for own consumption. These two factors together imply that the share of cash income form raw
cashew in household budgets is on average quite small—less than 5 percent.12 Of course, there
are important regional variations that need to be taken into account when assessing the impact on
farmers’ welfare. Cashew is a much more important source of income for farmers in Nampula
than it is in other regions. So farmers in Nampula have benefited more than farmers elsewhere.
The overall impact, however, seems to have been quite small.
Finally, the loss in consumer surplus that accrues to industrialists is equal to $8.90
million or the price increase times an average of ban and post-ban quantities (-(584269)(35+21.5)*.5). Note again that this does not take into account the losses associated with
unemployment. We discuss this in detail in section 7 of the paper.
Therefore, the bottom line is as follows. Even assuming all unemployment away, the
liberalization of raw nut exports has cost cashew processors $8.9 million on an annual basis. The
bulk of the benefits have accrued to traders and exporters of raw cashew, who have gained about
$8.2 million (=13.5 - 5.29). The government itself has gained about $2.0 million in export tax
revenue. The farmers themselves have received only $5.3 million.
5. The Role of Market Structure: Internal Marketing
The calculations above suggest that the gain accruing to the farmers has been quite small.
One reason for this is that cashew growers receive only around 40-50 percent of the after tax
border price, with much of the rest going to local and regional traders. Despite the increase in
competition among traders in recent years, it is clear that the marketing channels for raw cashew

12

In the three provinces that he surveyed, Desai (2001) found that cash income from cashew nuts averaged 230,000
Mts. per household (Table 3.27). According to his estimates, total real consumption expenditures per capita stood at
around 1,800,000 Mts. (Table 3.13). Assuming five persons per household, the share of cash income from nuts in
total consumption expenditures is about 2.6%.

14
remain imperfectly competitive. Farmers’ income are depressed not only by transport and
marketing costs, but also by the market power exercised by traders.
The internal marketing of cashew is performed through a multi-tiered trading system.
While the system is currently evolving in response to market and regulatory changes, there is
essentially three layers of intermediation between cashew farmers and world markets: (a) local
buyers and small retail traders;13 (b) larger wholesale traders; and (c) exporters and the domestic
processing factories. This is shown schematically in Figure 5, which summarizes the key players
and the flow of cashews through the marketing system in 1997/98. The producers who
marketed approximately 52,000 tons of raw cashews in 1997/98 sit at the bottom of the system.
They sold 27,000 tons of raw cashews at formal local posts, 15,000 tons to local intermediate
cashew collectors, and 10,000 tons to small/retail traders. From the local posts and intermediate
local traders, the majority of cashews were then sold to agents informais (informal traders) or
agents retalhistas (formal retail traders). Empresas comerciais (large/wholesale traders) and
processadores (processors) make up the next tier.
Entry barriers at each of these levels are sustained by a combination of setup costs and
regulatory restrictions. For example, an export license is required to export raw nuts, and this
requirement is apparently enforced rather strictly (Kottak 2001). For mid-range traders, the
licensing requirements are not as significant. While technically one must be licensed, as long as
someone is working under an exporter, a license is not actually necessary. However, at the
small/retail trader level, one must obtain a license in order to set up a trading post and scales
within a given district. Small traders have to purchase this license from the district administrator
for a fee of approximately $2014 (Kottak, 2001). In addition, the elimination of the governmentset reference price may have aggravated asymmetric information. Prior to liberalization, the
government reference price was apparently clearly communicated. Since then, according to Dan
Owen (2001), there has often been “massive” confusion regarding prices.15 Producers perceive
that they had to sell their raw nuts early in the season. As a result, the itinerant traders who
approach the producers can have significant market power (Owen, 2001).
For both small and large traders, cashews represent only a limited portion of their trading
activities. According to Deloitte and Touche (1997), USAID found that cashew accounts for
some 10% of retailers’ overall business. Cashew trade is concentrated during the months of
November through February. Like producer prices, traders’ prices vary within a season. See
Table 4 for a history of trading margins based on the Deloitte and Touche (1997) and World
Bank (1995b) reports. We provide more details on each tier of the marketing structure below.
Small rural trader/retailer
There is generally one local post per village, if any, and therefore there is very little
competition at this level. While local informal and intermediate cashew collectors have
penetrated into some of the rural areas, there is still very limited competition and the majority of
13

While the primary tiers in the trading system have remained the same, prior to liberalization, the small retail
traders were solely formal traders. Since liberalization, informal small traders have also entered the trading system.
14
It is unclear whether this is per village/scale or 1 per district.
15
According to Phyllis Pomerantz, World Bank Country Director, Mozambique did not announce the 5-year
schedule for eliminating the export tax, thereby increasing the level of uncertainty (Pomerantz, 2001a).

15
producers have only one trader to whom they can sell their raw nuts. The informal traders and
small retail traders generally buy cashews from approximately 5-8 local posts. They typically
handle 5-12 tonnes of cashews. They are licensed and are required to pay a 3% circulation tax
(Deloitte and Touche, 1997). Small traders purchase cashew through barter (exchanging basic
foodstuffs and required farming inputs for cashew nuts) and, increasingly, through cash
transactions.16
According to Deloitte and Touche (1997), the informal/unlicensed traders (ambulantes)
have increased in number since liberalization. Informal/unlicensed traders are itinerant traders
who often have their own transport vehicles and therefore are able to travel to production areas
or posts located near production areas. It is difficult to estimate the number of informal traders.
However, in certain areas, they may exceed the number of formal traders. Informal traders will
usually only buy with a specific market in mind and are often connected with the larger traders
and exporters who may advance them the necessary money or goods to buy the cashews. They
have lower costs of business because they do not have to rent trading posts, do not pay the
licensing fee, and generally evade taxation. In the case of both the formal and informal traders,
the cost of transporting the raw nuts to the large trader/wholesaler is significant, due to the poor
rural infrastructure (Deloitte and Touche, 1997).
Large trader/wholesaler
Large traders/wholesalers are located in larger towns or on key trading routes. In contrast
to the retailers, there are fewer wholesalers, but they are well organized and financially very
strong (World Bank, 1995b). The large traders do not compete against each other, but rather
seem to have an overall area of operation (Owen, 2001). Entry is primarily limited by the high
official cost of working capital that bears an interest rate of approximately fifty percent. Large
traders generally have long-established businesses with close working relationships with retailers
(Deloitte and Touche, 1997). Large traders or wholesalers vary greatly in size (trading between
50 and 400 tonnes of cashews), and scope of trading activity (Kottak, 2001).
Exporters
According to Matule (2001), there are 8-10 cashew exporters in Mozambique who are all
based either in Maputo or Nacala, the primary port in Nampula Province. Each exporter
generally sources raw nuts through established relationships with mid to large-scale
traders/wholesalers (Kottak 2001). It appears that the main exporters attempt to roughly fix the
purchase price at the beginning of each year (Kottak, 2001, Mooney, 2001b).

According to Deloitte and Touche (1997), the exporters have a great deal of market
power. They found that,
In Nampula Province there is considerable overlap between the different levels of traders,
especially at the wholesaler/exporter level, where the same companies are operating.
This, combined with the long-term links between the wholesalers and some of the
retailers places the exporter in a very strong position regarding the purchase of the raw
nuts. This position has been weakened slightly over the last three years, especially by the
16

Deloitte and Touche (1997) and Kottak (2001). Nicholas Kottak worked as a trader in Nampula during the
1998/99 season.

16
arrival of the unofficial traders, but is still significantly stronger than the position held by
the factories.
According to the World Bank (1995b), the trading margin between the farm-gate and factory
gate price is generally approximately 50%.17
Linkages among large traders, exporters, and processing factories
Several trading corporations engage in large-scale trading, exporting raw cashews, and
also processing kernels. For example, Gani is a large trading company. It owns shares of
Angocaju, CC-Nacala, and Inducaju processing factories and has been one of the leading
exporters of raw cashew nuts for the past several years (Abt Associates, 1999). According to
Matule (2001), there are approximately 80-100 large traders and that the majority of these traders
are directly linked to the 8-10 exporters.18
The analytics of price pass-through in the presence of multi-tiered marketing
It is a standard result in the theory of industrial organization that vertical relationships
magnify the costs of imperfect competition when the units within the relationship act
independently. This is the “double-marginalization” problem, arising from the piling of two
distortions on top of each other (see for example Tirole 1988, 173-176). In the cashew case, we
have at least three layers, and hence a case of triple-marginalization. Because of the
multiplicative nature of these distortions, the implications for prices received by farmers can be
particularly severe.

To see this, consider the following simple model. Let there be three stages in the
marketing chain, with associated prices p1, p2, and p3. At each stage, we assume that buyers have
monopsony power while the sellers behave competitively. Hence in the first stage, farmers act
as competitive suppliers of raw cashew, with the positively sloped supply function Q = Q(p1)
and associated price elasticity of supply ε. They face n1 small traders who determine p1 in NashCournot fashion. Successive stages are analogous. Small traders face n2 large traders (who
determine p2), while large traders face n3 processors/exporters who determine p3. The
(exogenous) post tax world price is p*(1-t). We ignore transport and other costs, to focus purely
on imperfect competition. Under these assumptions, the ratio of farm-gate price to border prices
can be expressed simply as:

17

However, as Table 4 illustrates, the trading margins increased in 1993/94 when exporters’ margins reached
482.3% (World Bank, 1995b). This report notes that in 1993/94 Caju de Moçambique was “being paralyzed
pending its privatization and only one private factory was operating” and “wholesalers were able to export nuts
directly to India where they could more than double the price obtained from Mozambican factories” (World Bank
1995b).
18
Other trading companies involved in large-scale trading, exporting and processing include Joao Ferreira dos
Santos (JFS), which owns Cajeba processing factory; Has Nur, which owns Mocaju processing factory; and
Enacomo, the former state trading company which is currently a holding company that owns the Angocaju
processing factory. Further, Olam, Casa Salvador (Kottak 2001), C.C. Gordhandas Valabhdas, S.A.R.L., and
Ludwig Mueller (Mooney 2001b) participate in both trading and raw cashew exporting. The source for this data is
Abt Associates (1999), unless otherwise noted.

 1 + n1ε  1 + n2ε  1 + n3ε 

This expression clarifies the multiplicative nature of the distortion, and the steep discount
suffered by farmers as a result of the multi-tiered nature of the market. (Note that the price passthrough increases with the degree of competition at each stage. In the limit, if n1 = n2 = n3 → ∞,
p1 = p*(1-t). It also highlights the fact that increasing the degree of competition at any one stage
of the marketing chain will not get farmers a much higher share of the world price. For example,
even if there are thousands of small and large traders, if these traders only have access to a
handful of exporters—say three—farmers will only get around 40% of the world price.
Similarly, if it were true that farmers only had access to one small trader (as suggested by the
Deputy Director of INCAJU), then farmers would never get more than 20% of the border price
irrespective of the number of large traders and exporters. (We take ε= 0.25, the supply elasticity
associated with the medium-term scenario reported in World Bank (1995b)).
The expression also makes it clear that farmers’ welfare and hence the overall impact of
the liberalization is intricately tied to the number of traders. Note that the number of traders that
is relevant in determining the farmers’ share of the world price is the number of traders the seller
effectively has access to rather than the total number of traders in the country. This level of detail
is difficult to come by. However, using data on average actual margins for the 97/98 season and
a supply elasticity of 0.25, we compute the implied number of traders at each stage of the
marketing chain as: n1 = 11, n2 = 16, n3 =18 with farmers getting 48 percent of the final price.
Based on anecdotal evidence, these numbers appear somewhat on the high side. Part of the
explanation for this may be the fact that we are using a farmgate price average. According to
Desai (2001), farmgate prices within a given year vary widely. For example, during the 97/98
season, Desai (2001) found that roughly one-third of all farmers received no more than $0.26/kg
for raw cashew or 35% of the world price with some receiving as little as $0.17/kg or 24% of the
world price. Using these farmgate prices instead of the seasonal average brings the number of
effective traders faced by the farmer to between 2 and 5.
A fuller evaluation of the impact of imperfect competition would need more detailed
information on prices, numbers of traders, and the nature of strategic behavior. Nevertheless, this
exercise illustrates the relative inefficacy of price reforms in poverty alleviation when these
reforms focus on markets far removed from those that farmers actually transact in.
6. The Role of Market Structure: International Trade
Critics of the liberalization process in Mozambique have argued that because of “unfair
trade,” Mozambique must act strategically and devise an industrial policy aimed at promoting the
cashew sector.19 Claims of “unfair trade” can be boiled down to two: (1) India has monopsony
19

For example, the Deloitte and Touche (1997) study argues that “if the disadvantages faced by Mozambique
because of India’s trade policy are not countered with an export tax on raw nuts, processors will be faced with unfair
competition that will have far reaching consequences for the economy of Mozambique.” According to UNDP (1998:
64, 72, 73) 'if Mozambique pursues a free trade policy in marketing raw nuts, within a short period it will cease to
have a competitive processing industry.' Instead, 'the Mozambican government should learn from the industry
supports offered to, for example, Indian cashew processors, and should adopt similar measures.' Similar concerns
are echoed by ordinary Mozambicans. In a recent study by Patrick Nicholson (2002) several interviewees expressed

18
power in the purchase of raw nuts; and (2) other countries including India subsidize processed
cashew exports. From an economic standpoint, the latter is an argument that strengthens the case
for liberalizing exports of raw nuts, unless one is prepared to make a case that there are
substantial rents in world trade in processed cashew. After all, if India is subsidizing its
processing industry, that can only be good news for suppliers of raw nuts such as Mozambique.
So we focus here on the claim that India has monopsony power in the market for raw nuts.
Monopsony power on the part of India would lower the price that Mozambique earns for
its raw nut exports. On the assumption that the market for processed nuts is relatively
competitive, exporting raw nuts (instead of processed nuts) then entails a net terms of trade loss
for Mozambique. In addition, India’s monopsony power leaves Mozambique in a vulnerable
position vis-à-vis India should India’s need for raw nuts from Mozambique decline. In fact,
India’s eighth national development plan calls for self-sufficiency in the production of raw
cashew. Even if India does not achieve this goal, the concern is that the increase in supply will
push down the price that Mozambique can obtain for its raw nuts. In the event that India does
achieve this goal, Mozambique will have to look for another outlet for its raw nuts. We review
in this section the structure of international trade in raw and processed cashew. We also
document what we know about the Indian government’s policy vis-à-vis its cashew sector.
The world cashew market
Purchases of raw cashew have historically been dominated by India. Between 1990 and
2000, India bought 84% of the world’s raw cashew, followed by China (4%) and Singapore (4%)
(see Table 5). The Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (HHI) on the buyer’s side of the market is 7,069,
indicating a very high degree of monopsony power. By contrast, sales of raw cashew are much
less concentrated. Throughout the 1990s, Tanzania sold 32% of the world’s raw cashew
followed by Guinea-Bissau (14%), Vietnam (14%), Indonesia (10%) and Cote d’Ivoire (9%).
The HHI on the seller side of the market is 1,671.20 Although Mozambique shows up as
exporting no raw cashew in the FAO statistics, several other sources (Deloitte and Touche 1997,
Abt 1999, INCAJU 2001) report that Mozambique exported approximately 10% of the world’s
raw cashew over the last decade.

Table 6 indicates that there is much less asymmetry between buyers and sellers in the
world market for processed cashew. There are similar levels of concentration on the two sides of
the market, with the HHI for imports and exports at 2,377 and 3,443, respectively. Although the
market for processed cashews is moderately concentrated, neither side has the unilateral market
power that India has in the purchase of raw cashew. Imports of processed cashew over the
period 1990-2000 have been dominated by the United States (34%), with India following closely
(32%). India (52%) and Brazil (22%) dominate on the sellers’ side, with Mozambique’s share
standing at a paltry 2%.

concern over what they believed to be strategic behavior on the part of Indian traders. In their view, Indian traders
were out to close down factories in Mozambique by paying inordinately high prices thus making it impossible for
the Mozambican factories to compete. Now that virtually all of the factories have closed, the Indian traders can get
away with paying very low prices.
20
According to the United States Department of Justice, an index between 1,000 and 1,800 indicates moderate
concentration while an index above 5,000 indicates highly concentrated.

19
To better understand Mozambique’s position in these world markets, we examine
bilateral trade statistics for Mozambique (Feenstra, 2000). The main disadvantage of this dataset
is that it does not distinguish between raw and processed cashew. Nevertheless, we are able to
draw some conclusions from the data, since between 1980 (the start of the dataset) and 1991
Mozambique did not export any raw cashew.21 Table 7 suggests that India is the only outlet for
Mozambican raw cashew while there are several countries that import processed cashew from
Mozambique. According to these data, India did not import cashews from Mozambique until
1991 when the Government of Mozambique lifted the ban on exporting raw cashews. Until this
time, the United States and Western Europe were the largest importers of Mozambican cashews.
In 1990, the year just before raw cashew exports were allowed, Mozambique exported processed
cashew to 15 countries. The United States imported 76% of Mozambique’s processed cashew
while Europe accounted for the remainder. Table 7 also highlights the fact that the value of
exports peaked during the early 1980s (Feenstra, 2000).
In contrast to India where a significant share of kernels produced are sold domestically,
nearly all of Mozambican processed cashews are exported. Although historically the United
States and Western Europe have been the largest outlets for Mozambique’s processed cashew,
this may be changing albeit slowly. New, smaller-scale cashew processing factories are
increasingly focusing their attention on the domestic and regional market, particularly Maputo
and South Africa (Mooney, 2001a). However, it is estimated that only 2-5% of kernels produced
are sold on this domestic and regional market (Abt Associates, 1999).
These statistics make clear that by moving away from the export of processed cashew and
more heavily into the market for raw cashew, Mozambique has placed itself in the weakest
possible bargaining position. As an exporter of raw cashew, Mozambique faces essentially a
single buyer, India. By contrast, while the market for processed cashew is somewhat
concentrated, there is no single dominant player on either side of the market.
Indian cashew policy
The cashew market in India is both highly complex and highly regulated. India imports
both raw and processed cashew and also exports processed cashew. Unlike Mozambique, India
has a large domestic market for processed cashews. Estimates regarding the percentage of
domestic production that is sold locally range from 25%-45%.22 Imports of processed cashew
have been increasing and in 1996, the value of imported kernels totaled $194.2 million
(UNCTAD, 2001). In addition, the hundreds of processors in India rely to a large extent on
21

The value of exports based on the Feenstra data and the data from Desai (2001a), INCAJU (2001) and FAO
(2000) are quite different. During the period in which raw cashew exports were banned, from 1979/80 until 1991/92,
the FAO data for the value of kernel exports exceeded the values reported in the Feenstra data. In certain years, the
differences were significant. In 1988/89, the Feenstra value of exports was $9,902,000, while the FAO value was
$20,022,000. Differences in the data remain during the period of 1991/92 through 1996/97, the last year of the
Feenstra data. During this period, although the differences between sources were significant, for example $16.6
million in 1993/94, neither source consistently exceeded the others. Some of the differences in the data may be due
to differences in reporting the calendar year versus the seasonal year. However, that would not explain such
significant differences entirely.

22

According to Sampat (2001), approximately 25-30% of Indian production is sold locally. According to Nomisma
(1994), 40-45% of Indian production is sold on the domestic market.

20
imported raw cashew. According to Desai (2001c), there are approximately twelve brokers
involved in importing and trading raw cashew nuts.
Unlike Mozambique, producer prices in much of India are still regulated. The Indian state
of Kerala produces over 50% of the country’s raw cashews. In this state, producer prices and
marketing are controlled by the state. The State Cashew Development Corporation and the
Cashew Workers’ Apex Industrial Cooperative Society (CAPEX) have a monopoly on raw nut
procurement within Kerala. They fix producer prices and distribute raw cashews to processing
factories through a network of harvest and storage cooperatives (Nomisma, 1994). According to
Deloitte and Touche (1997), the state is “reputed to make a steady loss (due to the high prices
paid to the farmers which are not totally passed on to the factories) and this loss is periodically
written off, effectively representing a subsidy to both the farmers and the processors.” Raw nut
procurement and marketing are liberalized in the rest of India.
The Indian domestic market for processed cashews is highly protected. India levies a
40% tariff on imported kernels (UNCTAD, 2001). As a result of this protection, Indian
processors sell kernels on the domestic market for a premium compared to the international
market rate23. This premium is approximately 20-25% at the retail level and 10-15% at the
wholesale level (Sampat, 2001). According to Deloitte and Touche (1997), Indian processors
who produce for export are indirectly subsidized via their ability to sell licenses to import goods
free of the normal duty.24 FAO data in Tables 5 and 6 confirm the fact that India is
simultaneously importing both raw and processed cashew and exporting processed cashew. This
raises the possibility (though difficult to verify) that India is using the proceeds from local sales
of processed cashew to subsidize their exports of processed cashew.
Consider for example, the year 2000 in which India paid on average $0.79/kg for raw
nuts from Mozambique.25 India received on average $5.12/kg for exports of processed nuts.
Using a conversion factor of 4.2 (lower than the usual 5 for Mozambique because shelling by
hand has a higher yield), India therefore earned $1.79 per kg. of processed nuts before processing
costs ($5.12 minus 4.2 times 0.79). Deloitte and Touche (1997) estimates India’s processing
costs in 1997 at $1.82/kg. This implies that India would be losing about 3 cents per kg. of nuts
exported. One possibility is that all the raw nuts imported from Mozambique are processed to
sell domestically, while local nuts are purchased at a price lower than $0.79/kg and processed for
export. Alternatively, processors may be able to cross-subsidize exports with local sales. There
may be an incentive to do this because of the many perks awarded to exporters by the
government of India. Either way, the demand for Mozambique's raw cashew is artificially
inflated as a result of Indian trade policy.26
23

According to Desai (2001b), Indian domestic sales of kernels are taxed while exports are not taxed. He also
asserts that there is a premium on domestic kernel.
24
“Indian export incentives allow for access to import licenses free of the normal 27% duty for 50% of the value of
the exports. This right can be sold at 15%, effectively giving tax relief of 7.5% on imports to the full value of the
exports” (Deloitte and Touche, 1997, page 55).
25
None of the following estimates include transport costs.
26
It is not just India that protects its cashew industry. Brazil bans unshelled cashew nut exports unless special
circumstances prevail. And Vietnam and Indonesia have discouraged raw nut exports in order to encourage domestic
processing, by imposing export taxes of around 20% (Vietnam) and 30% (Indonesia) (Ministry of Tourism, Trade
and Industry, 1997).

21

What about the concern that India may one day no longer need Mozambique’s raw
cashew? Figure 6 shows a steady increase in Indian raw nut production. In 1980, India produced
180,000 tonnes of raw cashew; in 2001 India’s production had reached 450,000 tonnes. In
contrast to the steady increase in India’s raw nut production, raw nut imports by India have been
extremely volatile. A complete picture would also study changes in industry capacity but these
figures are difficult to obtain. Nevertheless, the steady increase in India's raw nut production is
consistent with India's goal of self-sufficiency in raw nuts and the phasing out of raw nut imports
from Mozambique.
Summarizing the evidence - implications for Mozambique
We have established that India has effective monopsony power in the purchase of raw
nuts from Mozambique. We have also shown that the market for processed cashew is more
competitive than the market for raw cashew. Thus moving from the export of processed nuts to
the export of raw nuts entails a terms of trade loss for Mozambique. Ironically, the liberalization
of the export market in Mozambique may have actually increased India’s monopsony power. The
countries exporting raw cashew to India do not collaborate with each other in setting prices or
quantities, and individually their market power vis-à-vis India depends on the number of
exporters per country. During the first year that Mozambique exported raw cashew to India, there
were only three exporters (Deloitte and Touche, 1997). As a consequence of market
liberalization, this number more than tripled and at last count ranged between 8 and 10. This
increase in competition at the export level–intended to benefit farmers–reduces Mozambique’s
bargaining power vis-à-vis Indian importers of raw cashew.27

We have also discussed the possibility that India (as well as other countries) may be
subsidizing their processing industries. But to return to the point made at the beginning of this
section, this would not be in itself an argument for Mozambique doing the same. In fact, ceteris
paribus these subsidies, if they exist, raise the price received by Mozambique raw cashew
exporters, and increase the cost to Mozambique of discouraging raw cashew exports. Our
discussion of the world market for processed cashew suggests that this is not a market where
there are likely to be substantial rents. Therefore, on this argument alone, one cannot make a
case for Mozambique to encourage domestic processing. The case would have to rest instead on
India’s monopsony power in raw cashews.
7. The Domestic Processing Industry: Unemployment Costs
Mozambique’s cashew processing industry is at a standstill. Although accounts vary,
most estimates put the total quantity of raw cashew processed in the last couple of years at close
to zero (INCAJU 2001; World Bank, 2002).

By 1997, the existing factories employed a total of 10,086 workers (Deloitte and Touche,
1997, Abt 1999). These factories began closing thereafter, and by 2001 none of the highly

27

Note that this may not be an isolated phenomenon. For example, Ghana sells cocoa to three large multinationals.
When the Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board was operating, it served as an effective monopolist in the sale of cocoa to
these multinationals. Now that the cocoa marketing board has been dissolved, Ghana’s bargaining power vis a vis
the multinationals has been reduced.

22
mechanized factories were still operational.28 However, it is not just the highly mechanized
factories that are having trouble. Cabo Caju, the first semi-mechanical factory to open in 1995 is
also reportedly having financial difficulty and Cajeba, another of the semi-mechanical facilities
is officially closed. The four factories that remain operational comprise a capacity of 2,450
tonnes and the ability to employ 625 people at full capacity. However, even the four factories
that are currently operating are not operating at capacity (World Bank, 2002).
Factory closures have exacerbated a severe unemployment problem in Mozambique.
UNDP (2002) estimates that 45% of the population in Mozambique is currently “economically
inactive.” Furthermore, unemployment rates are expected to rise with the increase in population.
Recent interviews by CAFOD (2002) suggest that whole towns have literally shut down as a
result of the closure of the factories. Many of the unemployed are women. Of the 4,214 workers
employed by Caju de Mozambique at the time of privatization, 60% were women. As Penvenne
(1997) points out, these women are not the politically powerful urban constituents Krugman
refers to in his NYT piece. In addition to wages, many of the factories apparently provided
education and care for the children of working mothers (Penvenne, 1997).
There are costs associated with this unemployment, especially since these workers are
likely to remain unemployed for some time. The broad societal and political costs of
unemployment are difficult to gauge. Easier to get a handle on are the narrower efficiency costs.
As long as these workers had a positive social marginal product—and as long as they have not
been reemployed—their unemployment entails an overall economic loss to the economy. Of
course, in the presence of export restrictions for raw cashews, the social product generated by
workers in the factories is uncertain, and can even have been negative. Their wages cannot be
used directly as indicators of their social marginal product. However, we have already estimated
the economic gains from the redirection of raw cashew away from the processors and toward
world markets (section 3). Therefore, any social gain resulting from the reduction in processing
activity has already been captured. The loss in the wage bill that is not made up by employment
gains elsewhere can then be appropriately treated as a component of the overall cost/benefit
calculus (see the analysis in section 3).
To compute this loss, we need an estimate of the number of people who lost their jobs as
a result of the liberalization. For this, we use the number of employees on the payroll at the time
of privatization reported in Abt (1999): 8,09129. This is roughly equal to the number of workers
employed in 1997 (10,086) less those employed in the newer factories (1,500) or 8,586 reported
by Deloitte and Touche (1997). It also corresponds roughly with the number of workers that
would have been required to process all of the marketed raw cashew had it not been exported.30
It is somewhat lower than the 9,900 reported by AIM which likely included workers laid off

28

As illustrated in Table 3, 14 of 18 factories have ceased operations since 1997. Four processing factories are
currently operational (Abt Associates, 1999, Mole and Weber, 1999, AIM, 2001, INCAJU, 2001b, World Bank
2002).
29
This includes both employees on the payroll of the state-owned enterprises and those on the payroll of the
factories that were never officially "owned" by the government.
30
Based on the "base case scenario" in Abt (1999) which reports the number of workers required to process 1,000
tonnes of raw nut by technology type, (130 impact, 175 Oltremare and 240 semi-mechanical).

23
from the newer factories. Assuming an annual average wage equal to $750 a year,31 the
efficiency loss associated with the loss of 8,091 jobs amounts to $6.07 million.
We note that this understates the overall level of unemployment in the cashew processing
industry. Since several of the newer factories are currently not operating and because the workers
at the newer factories are hired on a temporary basis, when the factories are not operating the
workers don't get paid. Nevertheless, unlike the larger mostly mechanical factories, the hope is
that these newer factories will reopen. At any rate, conceptually it does not make sense to include
these workers in our calculation of the efficiency loss associated with liberalization since these
jobs were created post-liberalization.
Reasons cited for “failure” of the cashew processing industry
To the owners of the large-scale processing factories, the export tax reduction is the
primary reason for the industry’s failure. But according to many others, these highly mechanized
factories were doomed to failure. In its original report, the World Bank asserted that the
Mozambican processing industry had a “fundamental structural competitive disadvantage
because of the technologies employed” (World Bank 1995b). In 1993, 97% of installed
processing capacity used either impact or Oltremare technology. According to the World Bank
(1995b), these highly mechanized processing technologies yielded a relatively low proportion of
whole kernels.32 Because of the technical limitations of the Mozambican processing system and
the substantial price differences between whole kernels and broken kernels (reaching as high as
50% per unit), the World Bank claimed that the value added by the Mozambican processing
industry was marginal or negative in the early 1990s, as illustrated in Table 8 (World Bank
1995b).33 The Bank concluded that more labor intensive technologies similar to those employed
in India would be more appropriate for Mozambique (also raising the possibility of temporary
protection using the “infant industry” argument).

In India, processing is performed predominantly by home-based individual workers who
are compensated on the basis of whole kernel yield. Shelling is done by hand with a hammer or
with pedal-operated shears (Nomisma, 1994).34 While the manual technology employed in India
31

Based on data in the Abt report suggesting that production workers make minimum wage per day plus 50% in
benefits, managers make approximately $5.00 a day including benefits, 85% of the workforce is production labor
and all workers are employed for 250 days a year.
32
“Over the 1988-92 period, the kernel yield in Mozambique was 18.7%…well below the 23-25% results obtained
in India” (World Bank, 1995b). However, the type of processing technology employed is not the only reason for
this difference. According to Deloitte and Touche (1997), “Raw nuts purchased by factories in India are already
dried and usually graded by farmers or traders, allowing for higher out-turn or kernel recovery which is said to be
26.5%.”
33
Note in Table 8 that the finding that the value added by the Mozambican processing industry has been marginal or
negative is highly dependent on the prices of raw and processed cashews, which are relatively volatile, and on the
kernel yield per ton of raw nuts that is assumed. As illustrated in Table 10, which is based on Deloitte and Touche
(1997), the value added by the Mozambican industry was positive between 1994/95 and 1996/97.
34

In 1990, there were 638 processing factories in India, the majority of which were located in the state of Kerela
(Nomisma, 1994). However, it is unclear whether home-based processing operations are included in this figure.
Nomisma (1994) estimated that in 1990, 280,000 workers were employed in the Indian processing industry and 90%
of them were female.

24
yields a higher proportion of whole kernels, there are costs in terms of labor standards. Raw
cashews contain a corrosive and toxic liquid called cashew nut shell liquid35 (CNSL) that can be
harmful to workers’ hands, causing open sores, if they are not properly protected. The highlymechanized impact and Oltremare processing systems employed in Mozambique prevented
workers from coming in direct contact with CNSL. The semi-mechanical system currently
employed by Mozambican processing factories is located somewhere between the manual
system used in India and the highly mechanized systems previously used in Mozambique on the
continuum of workers’ exposure to CNSL. The hand and foot-operated semi-mechanical system
opens the raw cashew by “clamping two converging blades along a nut’s seam and prying it open
by cleaving one of the blades” (Abt Associates, 1999).
Others within the World Bank apparently disagreed with the conclusions of the 1995
report. In 1996, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank’s private-sector
financing arm, poured three million dollars into the highly mechanized factory purchased by
Anglo-American and Oltremare (IFC, 1996). The negative evaluation of the mechanized
factories was also not shared by the private entrepreneurs who purchased and reopened all of
these factories during the 1995/96 season. Some observers have suggested that the majority of
individuals who purchased the factories simply made poor business decisions and did not
accurately calculate the risks, costs, and benefits (of the cashew processing industry). However,
an IFC official, Ewen Cobban, asserts that Anglo-American, like many corporations and
individuals who purchased the factories, had previous experience operating in the Mozambican
cashew industry and therefore “poor business decisions” were not the likely causes of the
processing industry’s failure (Cobban, 2001). A more recent examination by Abt Associates
(1999) has also found that processing technology was not the key problem facing the processing
industry:
the problems that confront the cashew processing industry have very little to do with
processing per se. …(The factories) operate with reasonable efficiency. …The real
problems that confront and constrain the rehabilitation and development of the cashew
processing industry in Mozambique are poor procurement practices and the lack of more
aggressive marketing. (Abt Associates 1999)
The issue of appropriate technology hinges in part on the supply of raw nuts. As
discussed earlier, there is no longer a constant supply of high quality raw cashews sufficient to
meet the processing industry’s capacity. This has been particularly problematic for the largescale factories that employ impact and Oltremare technology. In the case of impact technology,
the raw nuts must be of a consistent size in order to minimize breakage and produce high quality
kernels. The Oltremare processing system produces higher quality kernels, but its high capital
cost necessitates large volumes of raw nut throughput (Deloitte and Touche, 1997). Conversely,
the semi-mechanical technology employed by the factories that remain operational can
effectively process nuts of varying size and it produces a higher quality kernels at a lower cost.
When the factories were privatized, there was an implicit assumption that the constant supply of
quality nuts that had existed in the past would continue (Abt Associates, 1999).36
35

Historically, CNSL was a valuable product of the raw cashew nut until synthetic substitutes were developed.
However, World Bank official Johannes Zutt asserts that the supply of raw nuts may not be as limited as the
processors imply, for the processors are “extremely opportunistic” (Zutt, 2001). Several large processing factories
are owned by trading companies. Such companies choose to process raw nuts when it is profitable and otherwise

36

25

Finally, labor costs have been cited as a significant expense for the factories that were
privatized in 1995 and a factor in their inability to continue operating. Many owners of these
factories were forced to pay arrears for past labor when they purchased the factories. In addition,
under Mozambican law they were obligated to compensate workers for periods in which the
factories were not operational if the workers had not been formally given advance notice of a
plant closure and laid off. It is estimated that the total amount of severance and other payments
factories owe workers is approximately $5 million (Abt Associates, 1999).
Whatever the reasons for the failure of the industry, it is clear that without an increase in
the supply of raw nuts, there will be no vibrant processing industry in Mozambique. The capacity
of the smaller firms pales in comparison to Mozambique’s potential. And although the reasons
remain unclear, even these small firms appear to be having trouble turning a profit.
8. Dynamic Effects: Why Hasn’t There Been a More Vigorous Supply Response?
What does it take to get farmers to plant new cashew trees and market more raw
cashew?37 Output response to increases in producer prices in Mozambique has been
disappointing, and this is also true in much of the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa (UNCTAD, 1998).
In general, price and non-price incentives are both important in driving farmers’ decisions to
plant new cashew, and structural constraints can often be the determining constraint (Heltberg
and Tarp, 2001). We focus here on the credibility of policy reforms and farmers’ expectations
regarding future policies.

Credibility of reforms is important because farmers in Africa have often gotten the short
end of the stick. Prior to independence, farmers were at the mercy of colonialists who often got
their way by physical means (Isaacman, 1996). Independence did not make things a whole lot
better for the farmers. For example, Mole (2000) suggests that the collapse of the rural marketing
system in Mozambique during the fight for independence and later civil war had a devastating
effect on farmers' expectations. They lost confidence in the marketing system as a source of
goods for which cashew income could be exchanged. In addition, the organizational structure of
the post-independence cashew sector excluded traditional authorities from discussions about the
development of the cashew sector. The result was that efforts at promoting cashew tree planting
did not succeed because farmers were suspicious and fearful that the government would later
nationalize the trees.
Of course none of this would matter if the returns to investing in cashew occurred
instantaneously, so that current prices were all that farmers needed to know to make decisions.
But in fact there are large time lags, and investment in cashew entails significant sunk costs.
Under current conditions, the most important input to cashew production is labor. Approximately
50% of labor’s time is spent harvesting cashew during the period from September to January.
The remaining 50% of labor’s time is spent caring for the cashew trees prior to harvest (based on
they export the raw nuts. Therefore, the failure of the processing industry may simply demonstrate the relative
benefit of exporting the nuts and the costs of processing (Zutt, 2001).
37
The majority of Mozambique’s cashew orchard was planted in the 1960s. Since these trees have a maximum
productive life of 40 years (and typically are considered unproductive after 25 years), the future of the cashew
industry in Mozambique depends critically on new planting.

26
Mole, Table A-1.2, 2000). Thus, 50% of the farmer’s cost associated with cashew production
from existing trees is a sunk cost, incurred before the harvest price is known. Once the farmer
has spent time tending the trees – the only way he can hope to recover some of those costs is by
harvesting the cashew even if the price he receives for the raw cashew doesn’t cover the costs of
maintaining the trees. Investing in new trees -- even using existing trees as planting material -entails even greater sunk costs. Trees typically take from 3-5 years to bear any fruit at all and
take longer to bear enough fruit to make the investment worthwhile. The labor involved in
tending to these trees as well as the opportunity costs associated with planting new cashew trees
(not planting food crops) are all sunk costs.
The sunk costs associated with planting new cashew trees make a credible pricing policy
both more important and more difficult to achieve. From the farmers’ point of view promises by
the government to cover the farmers’ sunk costs are not credible in the absence of a commitment
mechanism. This is because opportunistic governments have an incentive to cheat farmers out of
these sunk costs by paying them the minimum required for them to bring their crops to market –
that is, to pay them only their harvesting costs. Anticipating this eventuality, farmers will of
course have no incentive to plant in the first place. Therefore, if the government is unable to precommit to an adequate price, the static, one-shot equilibrium in this game is one in which
farmers withdraw from production and the government gets no revenue.
Repeated interaction between farmers and the government make a cooperative outcome
more likely but not inevitable. As discussed in McMillan (2001) and McMillan and Masters
(forthcoming), in order for a cooperative outcome to be sustained, the farmer’s share of sunk
costs in total costs must be relatively small (yielding a low potential payoff to exploitation by a
rent-seeking government), the government's discount rate must be relatively low, and the
revenue the government expects to earn from the crop in the future must be relatively high
(leading to a high value on the future costs of exploitation in the present). Surely the uncertainty
about the future generated by the long civil war was enough to ensure that Mozambique’s
cashew sector would end up in a high-tax equilibrium.
One objection to this description of the situation in Mozambique might be the fact that
private traders (and not the government) have been purchasing cashew from farmers for over ten
years. However, privatization of the marketing sector is not enough to overcome the timeconsistency problem. Since competition among traders at the village level is minimal,
opportunistic traders have the same incentives as opportunistic governments to cheat farmers out
of sunk costs. Arguably, the traders face even more uncertainty about the future than the
government and hence will discount even more heavily future revenue relative to current
revenue. Thus, the privatization of the marketing system does not make this problem go way –
and possibly makes it worse.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that the government is not undertaking the
reforms completely of its own volition. Reforms in the cashew sector have been – and still are - a
pre-condition for obtaining World Bank money. As Rodrik (1989) points out, this exacerbates
the time-consistency problem. Even if the government is not serious about reforms in the cashew
sector, it has an incentive to embark on the reform in order to gain access to foreign assistance.
But this increases the likelihood that an observed reform will later be reversed. Thus, the

27
question that remains is not just how to move from the bad state to the good state, but how to get
farmers to believe that the good state will last.
The supply response depends, at a minimum, on communicating the reform and its
objectives to farmers. Even if the government fully intends to make good on its promises, this is
of little use if the farmers are actually unaware of the regime shift in pricing. In the cashew case,
it is astonishing how little communication there has been with farmers about the reforms in the
cashew sector. Not only were farmers not involved in designing the reform package, for the most
part they were unaware that substantial reforms were taking place. According to former World
Bank Country Director Phyllis Pomerantz, the government never officially announced the
outcome of its negotiations with the World Bank over the export tax. Given the critical
importance of the supply response, this has been a particularly important oversight.
Communication with farmers could also help overcome the time-consistency problem, if only by
increasing the costs of any later policy reversal. Increasing farmers’ awareness can also
strengthen their bargaining power vis-à-vis traders making it more difficult for traders to pay low
prices. By joining together to form a cohesive bargaining unit, they may even be able to put
pressure on traders to raise farmgate prices.
Communicated policy must also be credible to be effective. Enhancing credibility might
take several forms. Institutions that increase the farmers' bargaining power -- such as unions -could help increase credibility on several fronts. The option of cheating farmers out of sunk
costs becomes less attractive to traders when farmers have more effective means of retaliation for
low farmgate prices. Organizing farmers would also help increase their understanding of what to
expect and what to do when they don't get what they were expecting. Irreversible investments
and/or large up-front expenditures in the cashew sector by the government could enhance
credibility by making it costly for the government to allow things to go bad in the cashew sector.
Finally, changes that enable producers to escape taxation or retaliate against it, while not directly
affecting the credibility of reforms, diminish the importance of credibility by minimizing the cost
to farmers of a deceitful government.
What kinds of irreversible investments might the government undertake? Some of the
non-price mechanisms highlighted by Mole (2000) and Heltberg and Tarp (2001) could be a
place to start. For example, bad roads and a lack of transportation help to keep the marketing
sector uncompetitive. By investing in these things, the government can help to make marketing
more competitive and cashew farming more profitable. Access to credit is an important deterrent
to competition in the marketing sector. Providing traders with access to trade credit at reasonable
rates is an important initiative that could make cashew marketing more competitive. To the
extent that these initiatives send a signal to traders that the government is serious about making
reforms in the cashew sector work, they could have the effect of lowering the traders’ discount
factors and making a cooperative outcome more likely. Credit is also a problem for farmers. The
more sophisticated technologies for cashew growing require substantial outlays of cash in the
early stages of development. Providing farmers with access to credit to undertake these new
improved techniques sends a signal to farmers that the government is serious about revitalizing
the cashew sector.

28
Technological improvements that lower sunk costs by reducing the long waiting period
between initial planting and fruition, could help to minimize the time-consistency problem by
reducing the incentive to cheat farmers out of sunk costs. Mole (2000) provides an example in
the context of increasing the overall productivity of the cashew orchard: top-working. Topworking consists of using the rooting system of an old tree to graft on improved planting
material. This has the effect of pushing the initial production period up; with superior material,
production can begin within 18 months (compared with 3-5 years). This type of technological
advance substantially lowers the farmers’ sunk costs making predatory taxation less likely. The
obvious question is who is going to invest in this type of R&D, for that too involves sunk costs.
Government investment in this type of R&D might be one way to signal to farmers that the
government is serious about revitalizing the cashew sector.
9. Concluding Remarks
In January 2001, suspecting that the exporters were under-invoicing their shipments in
order to avoid paying the export tax, the Mozambican government placed a temporary embargo
on the export of raw cashew nuts to India (AIM, February 7, 2001). It appears that the embargo
was lifted quickly when the government subsequently determined that the prices reflected the
decline in the world market price (Zutt, 2001). Nonetheless, the episode demonstrates the shaky
nature of the reform and the fragility of the pricing regime that governs cashew exports. After
more than ten years of attempted reform, there is little to show for it.

Our analysis indicates that there were several reasons for this failure. On the economic
side, the reforms took little note of important market imperfections such as the multi-layered
marketing chain and the monopsony role of India that reduced the benefits to cashew farmers.
There was virtually no attention paid to the credibility of policy changes and how to enhance it.
The government made little effort to manage the political fallout that should have been quite
predictable ex ante. And the World Bank did not sufficiently appreciate the ineffectiveness of
buying reform through aid-cum-conditionality. In all these respects, Mozambican cashews
provide an illuminating case study of the misfortunes that have befallen the reforms that African
countries undertook in the last couple of decades.

29
Appendix A: The Debate
The opposition to the World Bank’s policies in the cashew industry is multi-faceted.
Many opponents assert that decreasing the export tax would not have led to increases in producer
prices and cashew production as predicted by the World Bank (see Hanlon 2000). Hanlon and
others (including Carlos Cardoso, a journalist who was subsequently murdered) claim that the
peasant farmers did not gain from the liberalization of exports. They point to traders as the main
beneficiaries (Hanlon, 2000, Whewell, 2000). Fauvet (2001) asserts that the policy actually
harmed the producers, who had benefited from competition for raw nuts. He cites that the
producer price fell by 50% when the factories closed.38

Critics of the World Bank claim that owners who purchased the processing factories from the
government in 1995 required a period of protection in order to rehabilitate the factories following
the civil war and the period of government operation in which the equipment had deteriorated.
According to Hanlon (2000), “there was an informal agreement with the owners of the newly
privatized companies that they would be given a period of protection while they rehabilitated and
modernized the factories.” According to Fauvet, the agreement to continue protecting the
processing industry was even more explicit:
AICAJU , the cashew processors association, argues that the government defaulted on the
contracts signed with the new owners. The contract with Angocaju, for instance, clearly
stated the government would guarantee the supply of raw nuts to the factories, and only
nuts surplus to the factories’ requirements would be exported. (Fauvet, 2001)
Without a ban on exporting raw nuts or a prohibitively high tax, the processing factories could
not obtain enough raw cashew nuts to operate. According to Mondlane, the policy has
“effectively stimulated the export of raw nuts to India, starving the local processing industry of
its raw material” (Panafrican News Agency, 1999). Derek Higgo, managing director of Mocita,
claims that the inadequate supply of raw nuts was a key problem (Whewell,2001).
Opponents also cite the financial costs of liberalizing the cashew industry:
For every ton of raw nuts exported, Mozambique loses $150 that it would have earned
had that same ton been converted into processed kernels. The Frelimo deputies estimate
this loss over the past four years at $12 million. Businesses invested $25 million in
cashew processing after 1994 – this risks being a total write-off. (AIM, 1999).
These opponents assert that Mozambique cannot compete with Indian cashew processors without
protection. They argue that protection is warranted given Indian labor standards and Indian trade
policies that we discussed in the paper.
The critics argue that the World Bank did not consider the risk that Mozambican
producers would become dependent on India as a single buyer. Indian merchants are currently
paying the same prices the factories were willing and able to pay. According to Cobban (2001),
the World Bank’s policy effectively destroyed not only the Mozambican processing industry, but
also any competition that the Indian buyers faced. In addition, India has a policy of expanding
domestic cashew production in order to meet its processing capacity. Critics question who will

The farm gate price fell by 50% in 2001, however the FOB price also decreased by 43% (Desai, 2001a).

30
buy Mozambican raw nuts if the Mozambican processing factories close and the Indian demand
for imported raw cashews decreases (Torcato, 1998).
Owners and operators of the large-scale, capital-intensive processing factories that have
closed assert that they cannot and should not be forced to compete against an Indian industry
with lower labor standards. As discussed earlier, India’s cashew industry depends more on
manual labor to shell raw nuts. According to Jeter (2000), this system is cheaper, but exposes
workers to the toxic CNSL. According to Derek Higgo, workers at the Mocita processing
factory, which employed automated processing technology, did not come into direct contact with
CNSL, but that is not the case in the Indian industry (Whewell, 2000).
Finally, opponents criticize the World Bank for infringing on Mozambique’s sovereignty
and forcing it to accept policies against its will (Hanlon, 2000). According to Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano, Mozambique “had to liberalize the export of raw cashews in order
to obtain other benefits from the Bretton Woods institutions.” Specifically, he asserts that
Mozambique complied with the World Bank’s liberalization policy in order to qualify for HIPC
debt relief. However, he asserts that the cashew industry was sacrificed as a result (AIM, June
25, 2001).
While the opposition has succeeded in drawing a great deal of attention to the World
Bank’s intervention in the Mozambican cashew industry, it has also been the subject of criticism
itself. In a New York Times editorial, Paul Krugman (2000) criticized the opposition,
particularly Robert Naiman of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, for not fully
understanding the case. He asserted that the rural peasant farmers, who lack political power,
were forced to bear the cost of the export tax which forced them to sell their crop cheaply to the
domestic processing industry. The export tax, according to Krugman, was a means of protecting
the processing industry and its relatively small number of politically influential factory owners
and workers. He concluded that the export tax had a net negative impact on Mozambique and
that World Bank was justified in making loans conditional upon reducing the export tax.
Naiman responded to Krugman’s editorial in a New York Times letter to the editor. The
New York Times, however, published an abbreviated version of Naiman’s original letter. In the
unabridged letter, Naiman asserts that the Bretton Woods institutions exercise “colonial power
over developing countries” and that the “dogmatic trade liberalization” that they impose hurts
developing countries (Naiman, 2000a). Naiman also provides some figures to counter
Krugman’s claim that the World Bank policy has benefited the poor. In the published version,
Naiman cites the Deloitte and Touche Report (1997) which, Naiman asserts, found that
“Mozambique’s peasants did not gain anything from liberalized exports of raw cashews”
(Naiman, 2000b).39

39

We have been unable to find this quotation in Deloitte and Touche (1997). The report does state that, “These
concessions to liberalization (reducing the export tax), with the assistance of the gradually increased minimum
farmer price, and the diminishing supply of raw nuts, have sharpened the competitive trade in the rural areas
resulting in a trend of increasing producer price, especially toward the end of the 1997 buying campaign. However,
it is only those large farmers with the ability and financial capacity to store nuts that have benefited.”

31
Graham Mann (2001) has echoed Pual Krugman’s arguments. He criticizes Paul Fauvet,
an opponent of the World Bank, for not fully understanding the case. He asserts that reducing
the tax on raw cashew exports, as advocated by the World Bank, led to increases in farm-gate
prices between 1996 and 1999. He further asserts that the producer benefits would have
continued had the Government fully implemented the World Bank policy and completely
eliminated the export tax. Mann counters the opposition’s claims that the factories failed
because of an inadequate supply of high quality raw cashew nuts. He states that “more than half
of these factory owners who complain about having no nuts for their factories were also
exporting raw cashew nuts in all sorts of discounted arrangements with India.” Mann implies
that factories that did fail due to inadequate supplies of raw nuts made poor business decisions.
He states that Mocita was advised that it would only be viable if it could run at full capacity, yet
it proceeded to rehabilitate the factory despite the fact that the supply of high quality nuts at the
time was insufficient.
Recent Developments
In 1999, a bill entitled “Proposed Bill for the Cashew Sub-Sector Reindustrialization in
Mozambique” was introduced in the Parliament. “The bill proposed to ban the export of raw
cashew nuts, that priority be given to first supplying the local processing industry, and that
market prices be set at the producer level” (Mole and Weber, 1999). However, this bill was not
passed in its original form. “In October, 1999, the National Assembly passed a law providing for
an increase in the export tax on raw cashew nuts from 14% to 18-22% and for a first right to
purchase raw nuts for the benefit of indigenous processors” (IMF, 2001).

A national meeting on the cashew industry was held in Nampula on July 5, 2001. This
meeting focused primarily on ways to increase cashew production. According to Agriculture
Minister Helder Muteia, the government has introduced a program to expand and renew the
cashew orchard, increasing production to more than 100,000 tonnes within three years (AIM,
July 5, 2001). This is to be accomplished through improving planning and cashew farming
techniques, including chemically treating trees. The meeting also addressed issues of concern to
the processing industry. It recommended liquidating several inefficient processing factories that
are not currently operating, including Mocaju, Procaju Inhambane and Manjacaze, and Polycaju.
It also recommended terminating redundant workers’ employment and changing the labor laws
to facilitate hiring temporary labor.
