NBER Working Paper No. 9244

JEL No. I0, J13
ABSTRACT

This purpose of this paper is to examine the causal impact of substance use on risky sexual
behaviors by teenagers. Risky sexual behaviors, which include unprotected sex and multiple
partners, are highly correlated with alcohol and illicit drug use, although the nature of the causal
relationship is in question. This study uses two-stage least squares and reduced form models to
examine the relationship between substance use and sexual behaviors by gender. Data come from
the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys. Result show that alcohol use does not increase the likelihood of
having sex or of having multiple partners, although alcohol use does lower the probability of using
birth control and condoms among sexually active teens.

1. INTRODUCTION
Recent years have seen a widespread public concern with the practice of safe sex. While
this concern has been brought on mainly by the AIDS epidemic, the benefits of safe sex include
protection against other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and unwanted pregnancies. In
particular, sexual risk taking behavior, or unsafe sex, is a prevalent problem among teenagers.
Broadly defined, sexual risk taking behaviors include unprotected sex, unfamiliarity with the
partner, and multiple partners. While the last two outcomes are not necessarily risky
behaviors, they are included under the rubric of risky sexual behavior because when the
partner is not well known and when there are multiple partners, it is more likely that the
infection status of the partner is unknown. Knowledge of the infection status can lead to
practices such as condom use or abstinence, which compensate for the risk of contracting a
STD (Laumann et al. 1994).
Studying the sexual behavior of teenagers is important because when compared to
older adults, teenagers and young adults are particularly at risk for contracting a STD or having
an unwanted pregnancy. For example, young adult women between the ages of 20 and 24
have the highest rate of unintended pregnancy, and teenage women between the ages of 15
and 19 have the second highest rate (Henshaw 1998). Incidence rates of chlamydia and
gonorrhea--the two most common STDs-- are also high among teenagers and young adults.
In 2000, the chlamydia incidence rate was 258 per 100,000 population for persons of all
ages, 1,373 for teenagers, and 1,404 for young adults (CDC 2000). The corresponding
gonorrhea incidence rates were 132, 516, and 623, respectively. Approximately onequarter of all new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections occur among teenagers
and young adults (CDC 1997). Thus, the focus on teenagers is significant since the health

1

and development of teens are particularly affected by their sexual behavior.
An important question for policy purposes is to identify what causes teens to engage in
unsafe sex. Two of the most commonly cited correlates of risky sexual behavior are alcohol and
drug use. Numerous studies have shown a positive association between substance use and risky
sexual practices (see Leigh and Stall, 1993 and Donovan and McEwan, 1995 for reviews of this
literature). Recent studies, such as Graves and Leigh (1995), show that young adults who drink
heavily or use marijuana are more likely to be sexually active and to have multiple partners, and
those who are heavy drinkers are also less likely to use condoms. Evidence also comes from
Strunin and Hingson (1992) and Fergusson and Lynskey (1996) who show that alcohol use by
teenagers is associated with unprotected intercourse. Rosenbaum and Kandel (1990) show that
prior use of alcohol or illegal drugs increases the risk of initiating intercourse prior to age
sixteen.
It is important to note that none of these studies establish a causal relationship from drugs
and alcohol use to risky sex, rather, these studies highlight an association. There are several
competing explanations of the observed association, each with different implications for
the direction of causality between substance use and sexual behaviors. Laumann et al.
(1994) propose that alcohol and drugs may enhance sexual desire, and that substance use may
also result in impaired judgment and increase the likelihood that condoms and other birth control
methods are not be used. These theories imply that alcohol and drug use cause risky sexual
practices. By contrast, according to Jessor and Jessor’s (1977) “problem behavior theory”
the two outcomes are manifestations of a common personality trait. This suggests that
risky sex and substance use are associated because both are related to an unmeasured third
variable such as a thrill-seeking personality. Leigh and Stall (1993) find support for this

2

theory by citing many studies which show that cigarette smoking is also highly correlated
with risky sex. It is hard to argue that smoking is an indicator of temporary lapses in
judgment, which is one argument for why alcohol use may cause risky sex. Finally,
Cooper et al. (1990) point out that a teenager who chooses to have many sexual partners
may use drugs and alcohol to cope with society’s negative view of such behavior. In
effect, the teenager consumes these substances to lower the psychic costs of risky sex. In
this scenario, risky sex causes, but is not caused by, substance use. Reverse causality also
occurs when a youth is introduced to or obtains drugs and alcohol from a sex partner. This
is more likely the earlier the youth begins to have sex and the more sexual partners that he
or she has.

2. RELATED RESEARCH
The studies discussed above which show a relationship between substance use and risky
sexual behaviors fail to establish a direction of causality. Insights from the literature of
economics may provide information on the direction of causality, if any. One important paper
from the economics literature is by Kaestner and Joyce (2001) who examine the effects of
substance use on the probability of unintended pregnancy and contraception use. Using the 1984
and 1988 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), the authors try to
establish causality from substance use to unintended pregnancy using instrumental variable and
fixed effect techniques. They estimate the equations separately by race and find that when the
unmeasured individual traits are controlled for in the fixed effects models, alcohol use increases
the likelihood of unintended pregnancy and contraception use for whites, while drug use has no
statistically significant effects. By contrast, substance use is statistically unrelated to unintended

3

pregnancy for blacks and Hispanics. Estimates using instrumental variables were found to be
unreliable because of lack of powerful instruments in predicting drug and alcohol use.
Chesson et al. (2000) use state-level beer and liquor taxes to help establish the direction
of causality between alcohol consumption and sexually transmitted diseases. The authors find
that an increase in the beer tax or the liquor tax will reduce the rates of gonorrhea and syphilis.
Since the only way the alcohol taxes should affect STD rates is through reduced consumption,
the authors conclude that this is evidence of a causal relationship from alcohol use to risky sexual
behaviors which in turn lead to the contraction of a STD.
Rees et al. (2001) examine the effects of marijuana and alcohol use on the sexual
practices of high school age teenagers. Using bivariate probit and two-stage least square
estimation to control for unobserved heterogeneity, they find little evidence to suggest that
substance use has a causal impact on probability of being sexually active and the probability of
having sex without contraception. Specifically, they show that for females, neither drunkenness
nor marijuana use impacts the probability of having sex and using condoms. For males,
drunkenness has no impact on the probability of having sex, but it may lead to a lower
probability of using condoms. Marijuana use has no impact on sexual behaviors by males.
Liang et al. (2002) use a survey of college students to examine the causal relationship
between drinking and risky sex. These authors use four different indicators of sexual behavior in
the past thirty days: having sex, sex with multiple partners, sex without a condom, and sex
without any birth control. Alcohol control policies are used as instruments to help establish
causality. Using bivariate probits and splitting the sample by gender, the authors find that
drinking increases the probabilities of having sex, sex with multiple partners, sex without
condoms, but has no impact on sex without any birth control. These results often do not hold

4

when two-stage least squares is used to estimate the models making it difficult to draw any firm
conclusions. The most trustworthy results appear for females. In particular, females who drink
are more likely to have sex without a condom.
The studies by Rees et al. and Liang et al. are similar in design to this paper. Both use
instrumental variables to explore the nature of the relationship between substance use and risky
youth sexual behaviors although neither estimates the reduced form equation to confirm their
results. Additionally, these two studies are flawed in their examination of impact of substance
use on the use of condoms or birth control. They both treat the decision to use birth control use
as independent from the decision to have sex. That is, respondents who have sex and do not use
birth control are compared against both abstainers and sexually active youth who consistently
use birth control. The resulting coefficient on substance use reflects both the decision to engage
in sex and the decision to use protection, making the distinct impact of consumption on birth
control use unknown. In this paper, we correct for this problem by examining condom and birth
control use only for the sexually active sample of teenagers.

3. METHODOLOGY
The above discussion on the possible ways drugs and alcohol might be related to sexual
behaviors can be summarized in three ways: 1) drug and alcohol use causes unsafe sex; 2)
unsafe sex causes drug and alcohol use; 3) drug and alcohol use and unsafe sex are both caused
by an unobserved third factor, such as a thrill-seeking personality. Taking into account these
three cases gives the following equations:
Sit = α0 + α 1Ait + α2Dit + α3Xit + α4ui + εit,

(1)

Ait = β0 + β1Sit + β2Pdit + β3Pajt + β4Yit + β5ui + ωit,

(2)

5

Dit = δ0 + δ1 Sit + δ2Pait + δ3Pdjt + δ4Yit + δ5ui + ηit,

(3)

where S represents a measure of risky sexual behavior, A is a measure of alcohol use, D is a
measure of drug use, Pa is the price of alcohol, Pd is the price of drugs, and X and Y represent
observed individual characteristics which may affect sexual behavior (X) and drug and alcohol
use (Y). The vectors X and Y may have many of the same elements in common. Unobserved,
individual traits which do not vary over time are represented by ui. The subscripts i, j, and t, refer
to individuals, geographic area, and time, respectively. The prices of drugs and alcohol appear in
equations 2 and 3 because of evidence that drugs and alcohol are complement goods (Saffer and
Chaloupka, 1999).
Many of the studies discussed in the introduction have used ordinary least squares
(OLS) to estimate equation 1. However, estimating equation 1 by OLS can lead to biased
and inconsistent coefficients if there is reverse causality present (β1 ≠ 0 and δ1 ≠ 0) or the
unmeasured individual-level factor is correlated with sexual behaviors and substance use
(α4 ≠ 0, β5 ≠0, and δ5 ≠ 0). In either case, drug and alcohol use will be correlated with the
error term in equation 1 (α4ui + εt), thus estimates by OLS violate the requirement that the
right-hand side variables be orthogonal to the error term.
In order to avoid the problems presented by OLS estimation, two stage least squares
(TSLS) is used to estimate equation 1. The TSLS technique requires at least one
exogenous variable (instrument) that will predict drug and alcohol use but which is not
correlated with the error term in the sexual behavior equation. When estimating equation 1
by TSLS, drug or alcohol consumption is first predicted by using the instruments and then
the predicted value is used as a regressor in equation 1. The predicted value of
consumption is purged of its correlation with the error term in the sexual behavior

6

equation, leading to unbiased estimates of drug or alcohol use on risky sex.
A reduced form equation can be derived by substituting equations 2 or 3 into
equation 1:
Sit = γ0 + γ1 Pajt+ γ2Pdjt+ γ3Yit+ γ4Xit + γ5ui + υit.

(4)

Estimating the reduced form equation shows the direct effect of changes in the prices of
drugs and alcohol in reducing risky sexual behaviors. A statistically significant price
coefficient implies that risky sex is a result of consumption since there is no intuitive
reason to believe that the prices of drugs and alcohol are determinants of risky sex holding
consumption constant. Thus, the reduced form estimation will serve as a check on the
validity of the results from the instrumental variable estimation.

4. DATA
Data on sexual risk taking behaviors and related outcomes come from the 1991, 1993,
1995, 1997 and 1999 National School-Based Youth Risk Behavior Surveys. These surveys
contain nationally representative samples of high school students in grades 9-12. Four measures
of sexual behaviors are considered, all of which refer to sexual practices in the past three months.
This time period is chosen because it corresponds most closely to the available illegal drug and
alcohol use questions. The first indicator refers to all respondents and is a dichotomous indicator
for whether the respondent has had sex in the past three months. The other dependent variables
are all limited to the sample of respondents reporting having sex in the past three months, and
include the number of partners, a dichotomous indicator of whether a condom was used at last
encounter, and a dichotomous indicator of whether any form of birth control was used to prevent
pregnancy at last encounter. Respondents are assigned a value of “1” for the birth control

7

question if condoms or birth control pills are used. In 1999, use of Depo-Provera (an injected
hormonal birth control) is also include as a method of birth control.
Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations for the four dependent variables and all
of the independent variables. Thirty-four percent of males and 37 percent of females report
having sex in the past 3 months. Conditional on having sex, the average number of partners is
1.79 for males and 1.29 for females. Sixty-nine percent of males and 64 percent of females who
have had a sexual encounter in the past three months report using some form of birth control,
while 61 percent of sexually active males and 47 percent of sexually active females report
condom use.
Three measures of alcohol and drug consumption are used. The first is the number of
days in the past thirty days on which the respondent had five or more drinks of alcohol in a row
within a couple of hours (termed binge drinking); the second is the number of days in the past
thirty days on which the respondent had at least one drink of alcohol; and the third is the number
of times in the past thirty days the respondent used marijuana.
The socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the respondents are very limited
in that only age, gender, and race are consistently reported in all surveys. These variables are
included in each model along with a dichotomous indicator for whether the respondent has been
educated about AIDS at school. Next, two variables are included that indicate whether or not the
respondent's age is greater than that of the majority of the class and whether or not the
respondent's age is less than that of the majority of the class. The former will help identify
students who have repeated grades while the later will identify students who have skipped
grades.
Some additional measures which may help control for the respondent’s personality or

8

propensity towards risk are included in all models. The first is how often the respondent usually
wears a seat belt when he or she is a passenger in a car (1=never, 5=always). Second, we include
the number of sports teams on which the respondent plays, which may reflect the respondent's
attachment to and involvement in school and the community. The number of days in the past
thirty days on which the respondent smoked is also included to represent unmeasured personality
traits since there is no reason to believe that smoking is directly correlated with risky sexual
practices. Next, when condom use and birth control use are considered, we include an indicator
for whether or not the sexual encounter in question is the respondent’s first time. This indicator
is takes on a value of “1” if the respondent’s current age is equal to the reported age at first
encounter, the respondent has had only one lifetime partner, and has had only one partner in the
past three months.
Finally, all models include dummy variables for the survey year, variables representing
the religious composition of the state, state real per capita income, state unemployment rate, and
dummy variables indicating the region in which the respondent resides. The survey year dummy
variables are included to capture secular trends in the outcomes, while the state and region
variables are intended to proxy unobserved attitudes towards risky behaviors that may be shared
by respondents living in the same state.

4.1. Instruments
Variables measuring the full price of alcohol and marijuana serve as instruments
which are used to predict consumption but not sexual behavior. The full price includes the
monetary price of purchasing the good plus factors that may increase the total costs of
obtaining the substance such as time and travel costs, or expected penalties for illegal

9

possession. The prices are theoretically valid instruments because there is no reason to
believe that the prices of drugs and alcohol are predictors of risky sexual behaviors,
holding consumption constant. Prices should, however, predict consumption. Previous
research has show that consumption of these goods is negatively related to their prices.
(Leung and Phelps, 1993, Grossman, et al. 1998, and Grossman and Chaloupka, 1998, Saffer
and Chaloupka, 1999).
Five variables will be used as instruments: The real state-level excise tax on a gallon
of beer, the real price of a pound of marijuana, the per capita number of outlets licensed to sell
alcohol in each state, and the midpoint of the minimum and maximum statutory fine and
jail terms (in years) for possession of small amounts of marijuana. Beer taxes come from the
Beer Association’s Brewer’s Almanac, the number of outlets licensed to sell alcohol come from
Jobson’s Liquor Handbook, marijuana prices come from the Drug Enforcement Agency, and
fines and jail terms are provided by the ImpacTeen Illicit Drug Team.

5. ESTIMATION AND RESULTS
Table 2 shows means of substance use by sexual behavior status. In all cases,
respondents who engage in sex and in risky sexual practices have higher rates of drinking and
drug use. For example, 39 percent of males who have had sex in the past three months also
binge drink, while only 15 percent of sexually inactive males binge drink. The corresponding
numbers for females are 23 percent and 10 percent. For sexually active respondents, Table 2
shows that compared to males who have had only one partner in the past three months, males
who have had more than one partner binge more frequently (3.86 days vs. 2.16), drink on more
days (7.52 vs. 4.34 days), and use marijuana more frequently (9.40 vs. 4.60). Similar trends

10

hold for sexually active females. Teens of both genders who do not use condoms or birth control
also drink and use marijuana more than those who do use protection. It is important to note that
these results establish a correlation between substance use and risky sexual behaviors, but do not
address the issue of causality.
Table 3 shows the impact of binge drinking on the likelihood of having sex in a
multivariate analysis. In this table and the tables that follow, the results are presented separately
by gender. The t-ratios in brackets are based on standard errors which are take account of the
correlation among individuals living in the same state and year (Huber 1967).
The OLS results in column 1 of Table 3 shows that for males, binge drinking is positively
associated with having sex. However, the results of the TSLS and the reduced form provide no
evidence that this result is causal. First, the TSLS coefficient on binge drinking is negative and
statistically insignificant (column 2). A number of tests point to the efficacy of the TSLS
procedure. First, an overidentification test indicates that the exclusion restrictions are valid.
Second, the instruments in the first stage (column 3) are statistically significant predictors of
binge drinking and demonstrate the expected sign. Here, higher beer taxes will lower binge
drinking, and more outlets licensed to sell alcohol will raise binge drinking. The coefficient on
the price of marijuana is negative and significant providing some evidence that marijuana and
alcohol are complement goods. The partial F-statistic associated with the excluded instruments
is 2.56, which is low, but is statistically significant. Note that Bound et al. (1995) show that as
the F-statistic on the instruments gets smaller, the bias in the TSLS estimates approaches that of
OLS casting some doubt on the TSLS estimate. Indeed, the Hausman test for the consistency of
OLS confirms that the TSLS estimate is no different from the OLS estimate, thus drawing into
question the reliability of the TSLS estimate.1 Therefore, the coefficients in the reduced form

11

model in column 4 become important as they provide an alternative test of causality. Here, none
of the coefficients on the instruments predict the likelihood of having sex, providing further
evidence that for males, binge drinking is not a causal determinant of having sex.
The results for females are presented in columns 5-8 of Table 3. The OLS
coefficient is positive and statistically significant while the TSLS coefficient is negative and
insignificant. The reliability of the TSLS estimate is questionable as the F-statistic on the
instruments is low, and the Hausman test is rejected only at the 10 percent level. However, the
coefficients on the beer tax and alcohol outlets in the reduced form confirm the finding of no
impact of binge drinking on the probability of having sex in the TSLS model. Note that the
coefficient on the price of marijuana is negative and significant in the first stage regression, and
positive and significant in the reduced form. Thus, there is some evidence that marijuana and
alcohol are complement goods, and that lowering the price of marijuana will raise consumption
of alcohol or marijuana and lower the probability of females having sex. One possible
explanation for this result is that for females, excessive drug and alcohol consumption may
inhibit sexual desire rather than promote it. Alternatively, males may be unwilling to “take
advantage” of a female who is under the influence.
Table 4 shows the impact of binge drinking on the number of partners conditional on
having sex in the past three months. For both genders, the OLS results show that binge drinking
is associated with having more partners, while the TSLS and reduced form estimates do not
uphold this result. The insignificant TSLS coefficients suggest that binge drinking does not have
a causal impact on the number of partners. For males, the low F-statistics on the instruments
makes the validity of the TSLS estimate questionable, however, the overidentification
restrictions are valid and the Hausman test rejects the consistency of OLS. For females, the F-

12

statistic is low, but is statistically significant, whereas the overidentification restrictions may not
be valid and the Hausman test cannot reject OLS. Despite these questionable TSLS results, the
reduced form tells a similar story. Here, neither higher beer taxes nor fewer alcohol outlets will
lower the number of partners for either gender. Raising the marijuana price will have no impact
on lowering the number of partners, although longer jail terms for marijuana possession may
lower the number of partners for females.
Tables 5 and 6 contain the results of the impact of binge drinking on birth control use and
condom use, respectively. Unlike with the probability of having sex or the number of partners,
binge drinking does appear to causally impact the use of birth control and condoms. For both
genders, the TSLS coefficients on binge drinking are negative and statistically significant. As
seen previously, the TSLS models suffer from low F-statistics on the instruments in the first
stage, although the overidentification restrictions are valid, and the Hausman test is rejected in all
cases except for condom use by males. In the reduced form, higher beer taxes will raise the
probability of using any birth control and condoms for males. Higher marijuana prices will also
increase the use of birth control among sexually active males. For females, higher beer taxes
have no impact, although higher marijuana prices will lead to more use of birth control and
condoms.
Table 7 shows the results when the number of days in the past thirty days on which the
respondent had at least one drink of alcohol is the measure of substance use. Coefficients from
the OLS, TSLS and first stage regressions are shown. The reduced form estimates do not change
from those in Tables 3-6 and are therefore not repeated. The results for drinking any positive
quantities are very similar to those for binge drinking. In the OLS models, drinking is positively
related to the probability of having sex and having multiple partners for both males and females,

13

and is negatively related to birth control use by both genders and condom use by males. As with
binge drinking, the TSLS coefficients show that drinking lowers birth control use for both
genders and condom use as reported by females.
Table 8 shows the OLS and TSLS coefficients when the number of times in the past
thirty days the respondent used marijuana is considered. Not surprisingly, the OLS results show
that marijuana use is positively related to the probability of having sex and having multiple
partners for both males and females. Marijuana use is negatively related to condom use and birth
control for males, but is not related to birth control use for females. Unfortunately, conclusions
about the causal nature of these relationships cannot be made from the TSLS estimates. None of
the instrument in the first stage are statistically significant predictors of marijuana use, thus the
TSLS estimates are unreliable. Recall however, that the reduced form estimates in Table 3-6 do
provide alternative evidence of the causal relationship. As previously discussed, a higher
marijuana price will raise the probability of a female engaging in sex, but will lower the number
of partners for females. Higher prices will also raise the probability of birth control use by both
genders and condom use as reported by females. One caveat is that it is difficult to attribute the
impact of higher marijuana prices in the reduced form directly to marijuana consumption given
that the first stage binge drinking and drinking regressions show that marijuana and alcohol are
complement goods.

5.1. Other variables
Estimates of the impact of the other included independent variables are shown in Tables
3-6. Results are unaltered when the other substances are included, and there is little difference
between the OLS and 2SLS estimation. Beginning with the decision to have sex, the regressions

14

show that older teens, blacks teens, and male teens of races other than white or black are more
likely to have recently had sex. Smoking is associated with a higher probability of having sex, as
is playing sports for males. Wearing seat belts and having been taught about AIDS (for males
only) are both associated with a lower likelihood of engaging in sex.
Similar character traits predict the number of partners. Teens who are black or of races
other than white or black have multiple partners. For females, age increases the number of
partners. Males who smoke or play sports have more partners, and those males who wear seat
belts or have been taught about AIDS have fewer partners. For both genders, a higher state
unemployment rate is associated with higher numbers of partners.
In regards to condom and birth control use, teenagers of races other than black or white
are less likely to use condoms or birth control, black females are less likely to use birth control,
and older teens of both genders are less likely to use condoms. Teens who play on sports teams
are more likely to use protection. Lastly, the indicator for first sexual encounter is negative for
males in the birth control equations and positive for females in the condom use equations.

6. CONCLUSION
Previous studies have shown a strong statistical correlation between drug and alcohol
consumption and teenage sexual behaviors. Models estimated by OLS confirm the findings of
previous studies, however, we show that for certain behaviors, this correlation does not translate
into causality. Through the use of instrumental variables and a reduced form equation, this paper
provides evidence against the theory that alcohol consumption causes teens to engage in sex or
have multiple partners, while providing evidence for the theory that alcohol consumption leads to
a lower use of birth control and condoms by sexually active teens. The impact of marijuana

15

consumption on teenage sexual behaviors remains unclear.
For males, the TSLS and reduced form results consistently show no impact of alcohol
consumption, or the exogenous determinants of consumption, on the probability of having sex or
having multiple partners. However, the TSLS models do show evidence that among sexually
active males, drinking will lower the probability of using condoms or birth control. The reduced
form results for these behaviors confirm the TSLS estimates and show that higher beer taxes and
marijuana prices will raise the probability of using birth control.
For females, the TSLS and reduced form results show that alcohol consumption does not
increase the likelihood of having sex. Also, there is no evidence of a causal impact of drinking
on the number of partners. As with males, the TSLS estimates for females do show evidence
that among sexually active respondents, drinking will lower the probability of using condoms or
birth control. In the reduced form models, however, higher beer taxes and fewer alcohol outlets
have no direct impact on the use of these forms of birth control, although higher marijuana
prices, which may impact both alcohol and marijuana consumption, will lead to the increased use
of birth control and condoms.

Adjusting the standard errors according to Huber (1967) have an large impact on the

value of the tests of the TSLS coefficient. The partial F-statistic based on unadjusted standard
errors is much higher at 7.48, and the Hausman test of the consistency of OLS is rejected at the 5
percent level.
