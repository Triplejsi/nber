Information Technology Externalities: Empirical Evidence from 42 U.S. Industries

NBER Working Paper No. 9272
October 2002
JEL No. D24, O47
ABSTRACT

Using interindustry transaction in input-output tables, we examine Information Technology
(IT) externalities in U.S. private industries over the period 1984-2000. Our empirical results show
that computerization of an industry’s customer and supplier industries reduces both labor and
material costs of the industry. Moreover, cost savings driven by supplier industries are larger than
those driven by customer industries. We also find that industries in the services sector enjoy more
benefits from IT spillovers than industries in other sectors because of their high IT capital intensity
and composition of interindustry transaction. Decomposition of total factor productivity (TFP)
suggests that IT externalities can explain considerable parts of TFP growth, although possible
mismeasurement of output in services industries leads to exacerbated technical changes of services
industries.

1. Introduction
The rapid innovation in Information Technology (IT) over the past few decades has led to
substantial changes in the U.S. economy. Modern economic activities are largely carried out with
the help of IT. One characteristic of IT capital distinguishing itself from a traditional capital
investment is its wide diffusion across industries and the broad range of its application.
Manufacturing industries operate computer-integrated manufacturing system to link design,
production, and management together for the efficient use of their resources. With the help of IT,
many services are customized and are provided just in time. There are many other areas of IT
application, such as management of inventories and human resources, accurate decision making
based on instant market data, effective control of supply chain, and so on.
With advanced communication technology, IT enhances the sphere of its application even
further. IT and communication technology make it possible for firms to interact with others in a
faster and more efficient way.1 The network effect of IT has been emphasized as one of the key
factors for assessing the value of IT by many researchers (Bresnahan, 2001; Brynjolfsson and
Hitt, 2000; Inoue, 1998). The IT network not only facilitates communication between firms but
also helps to streamline their production processes and lower transaction costs. Therefore,
another feature of IT capital that distinguishes it from other traditional inputs is that IT capital
may generate considerable economic externalities.
A network externality exists when the efficiency of products or services increases as
products or services are adopted by more users. There are two types of network externality,
direct and indirect network effects (Katz and Shapiro, 1985). The direct network effect comes
from an increase in users, while the indirect effect comes from the development of applications.

See Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2000) for case examples.

Both direct and indirect network effects also have a significant influence on the diffusion and
usage of IT.
There are some studies which empirically investigate whether a product exhibits network
externalities. Gandal (1994), for example, tested the existence of network externalities in the
computer spreadsheets market. He showed that consumers are willing to pay more for a
spreadsheet which is compatible with others. Brynjofsson and Kemerer (1996) also analyzed the
microcomputer spreadsheet market using a hedonic model to determine the effect of network
externalities. They found that the size of a product’s installed base, a key factor in network
externalities, indeed significantly affects the price of the product.
In addition to network externalities associated with IT, we may think of another type of
externalities of IT, the so called knowledge spillovers (learning effect). The adoption of IT
deeply involves innovations in the production process and organizational changes (Brynjolfsson
and Hitt, 2000). The knowledge that enables a firm or an industry to adopt advanced technology
successfully will naturally spill over to other firms or industries (Romer, 1986).
The one key element in both network and learning effects is interaction among IT users.
For the production sector, the interaction among agents can be observed as a transaction between
firms or industries. For example, Economides (1996) stressed that vertical relations among firms
can play a critical role in network and learning effects. In a similar vein, assessing IT
externalities between industries, we need to take into account the industrial interdependence
characterized by interindustry transaction.
In this paper, we construct IT spillover stocks available to an industry that are a weighted
sum of IT capital stock of other industries using weight equal to interindustry transaction. In
doing so, we distinguish the IT spillover stocks into two kinds: one from intermediate inputs

2

supplier industries and the other from customer industries. Then, we estimate a variable cost
function with the IT spillover stocks using the data on 42 U.S. private industries from 1984 to
2000. The results show that the IT spillover stocks reduce variable costs of all industries.
Furthermore, IT externalities driven by intermediate input suppliers are larger and more
significant than IT externalities driven by customers. Comparing industries, we find that benefits
of IT spillovers are greater in the services industries than in other industries not only because of
their high IT capital intensity but also because of their transaction patterns. In the analysis of the
long-run effect of the IT spillover stocks, we find that the demand for own IT capital of an
industry is significantly affected by the IT demand of customer and supplier industries. Finally,
our decomposition of total factor productivity (TFP) growth suggests that the IT spillover effects
can explain considerable parts of the measured TFP growth.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 constructs the IT spillover stocks.
Section 3 explains the empirical framework. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 presents
estimation results and section 6 concludes the paper.

2. Measurement of IT Spillover Stock
Constructing IT spillover stocks incorporating linkages among industries, we use an
interindustry transaction matrix in input-output tables. The interindustry transactions can be
divided into intermediate input demand from other industries and output supply to other
industries which, are also referred to as backward and forward linkages, respectively (Hirschman,
1958). 2 For example, the intermediate input purchase of industry A from industry B is the
backward linkage of industry A, while industry A’s sales of its output to industry C is the forward
2

Terleckyj (1974) and Wolff and Nadiri (1993) also use the interindustry flow matrix to examine the effect of R&D
spillovers on productivity growth.

3

linkage of industry A. Therefore, industry B and C are an intermediate input supplier and
customer industries of industry A, respectively.
Since there is no reason to assume from the backward and forward linkages of an
industry that IT spillovers are the same, we construct two types of IT spillover stocks, SOB and
SOF . SOB represents the IT spillover stock available through intermediate input supplier
industries (backward linkages), while SOF represents the IT spillover stock available through
customer industries (forward linkages). We assume that the IT spillover stock from industry j to
industry i increases as industry j supplies its product relatively more than other industries do to
industry i. Then, the IT spillover stock of industry i through intermediate input supplier
industries is given by:

SOBi = ∑
j ≠i

a ij j
KO ,
xi

(1)

where a ij is the value of industry i’s intermediate input purchased from industry j, xi is the total
value of industry i’s interindustry transaction including both demand and supply transactions,
and K Oj is the IT capital stock owned by industry j. Therefore, SOBi depends not only on the size
of other industries’ IT capital stocks but also on the transaction matrix of industry i. In the
extreme case, if industry i does not need any intermediate input from industry j, then the IT
spillover from industry j will be zero no matter how large the IT stock of industry j is.
Similarly, we construct IT spillover stock available through an industry’s customer
industries. Assuming that the size of IT spillover from industry j to i increases as industry j

4

purchases the product of industry i relatively more than other industries do, the IT spillover stock
for industry i through customer industries is given by:

SOFi = ∑
j ≠i

bij j
KO ,
xi

(2)

where bij is the value of industry i’s sales to industry j.3 Therefore, the IT spillover stocks, SOB
and SOF , provide us two different sources of IT externalities. 4 SOB will capture the IT
externality from computerization of supplier industries, while SOF will grasp the IT externality
from computerization of customer industries.
Table 1 presents each industry’s own IT capital stock ( K O ) and two IT spillover stocks
( SOB and SOF ) in 1984 and in 2000. From the first and the second column, the own IT capital
stocks increased very rapidly for all industries from 1984 to 2000. Roughly speaking, the own IT
capital stocks in 2000 are about 9-10 times larger than those in 1984 for all industries.
Examining the own IT capital stocks across industries, we can notice that services industries,
such as wholesale trade, bank and security, and business services, are the major IT using
industries. In fact, the IT capital stocks of services industries can explain most of total IT capital
stock in the U.S. private economy. Since our IT spillover stocks are weighted by transaction flow
between industries, the concentration of IT capital in services industries implies that industries
which transact more with service industries have larger IT spillover stocks. Within the

To avoid double counting the IT spillover stocks, we use the total value of transactions (demand and supply) as the

denominator in weights for both SOB and SOF . Therefore, the sum of ∑ i and ∑ i is equal to one.

manufacturing sector, industrial machinery and equipment and electronic and other electric
equipment use relatively more IT capital than other manufacturing industries.

[Table 1]

Columns 3 to 6 in Table 1 present the IT spillover stocks from the backward linkage
( SOB ) and the forward linkage ( SOF ) of industries constructed by equations (1) and (2). Due to
the fast growth of IT capital stocks in all industries, the IT spillover stocks also grew rapidly.
Comparing SOB and SOF in 2000, we come up with some interesting findings. First, thirty two
out of forty two industries have larger SOB than SOF . This difference comes from both the
proportion of intermediate input demand in total interindustry transaction and how much an
industry transacts with IT-intensive industries, particularly with services industries. Second,

SOF is generally smaller in manufacturing industries than in services industries, while SOB
shows little difference between manufacturing and services industries. Unlike backward linkages,
forward linkages of manufacturing industries are not as diversified as those of service industries.
For example, more than 50 percent of the interindustry sale of furniture and fixtures industry are
demanded by the construction industry. Since the construction industry is one of less ITintensive industries, SOF for furniture and fixtures becomes small.
Given our observation of the distribution of IT capital stocks across industries, it is
worthwhile to explore patterns of interindustry transaction, which result in differences of IT
spillover stocks across industries. Table 2 shows the composition of each industry’s transaction

6

with three sectors: primary and construction, manufacturing, and the services sector. 5 For
example, four percent of the total transaction in the agriculture, forestry, and fishing industry is
explained by transaction with industries in the primary and construction sector, 72 percent with
industries in the manufacturing sector, and 24 percent with industries in the services sector.
Comparing compositions of interindustry transaction in 1984 and in 1996, the composition of
each industry’s transaction has changed little over the period, although a proportion of
transaction with the services industries slightly increased for most of industries. We also find that
a large part of industrial transaction is carried out with industries within the same sector. Figure 1,
which graphs columns 4 to 6 in Table 2, clearly illustrates this transaction pattern. Starting from
the transportation industry, most transactions of the services industries are explained by
transactions within the services sector. These transaction patterns, together with IT-intensiveness
of services industries, suggest that if IT externalities exist through interindustry transaction,
services industries will experience relatively a large impact of IT externalities.

[Table 2] and [Figure 1]

3. Empirical Framework
Assuming capital inputs are quasi-fixed at time period t, an industry’s average variable
cost function with exogenously given IT spillover stocks are written as

5

The primary and construction sector includes agriculture, forestry, and fishing, mining, and construction industries.

7

Ctv
= C v ( Pt , K t , SOt −1 , yt , T ) / yt ,
yt

(3)

where Ctv is a variable cost at time t, yt is gross output, Pt is a vector of variable input prices,

K t is a vector of quasi-fixed inputs, SOt −1 is a vector of IT spillover stocks, and T is an index
indicating the level of technology. We assume labor (L) and intermediate input (M) as variable
inputs and non-IT capital ( K N ) and IT capital ( K O ) as quasi-fixed inputs.
To analyze the effect of IT spillover stocks on the structure of the average variable cost in
detail, we employ a restricted symmetric generalized McFadden cost function used in Bernstein
(2000). Incorporating quasi-fixed inputs, Bernstein modified a symmetric generalized McFadden
cost function introduced by Diewert and Wales (1987). Imposing homotheticity of the variable
cost function in output, we have a following average variable cost function.

Differentiating the average variable cost function in equation (4) with respect to variable
input prices and using Shephard’s lemma, we have the following variable input intensity
equations:

where qi ,t is the quantity of variable input i at time t. The intensity of variable input ( vi ,t )
depends on variable input prices ( pi ,t ), the industry’s output ( yt ), the time trend ( Tt ), the
intensity of quasi-fixed inputs ( kl ,t ), and the IT spillover stocks ( SOh ,t −1 ).
In addition to the system of variable input intensity equations, information about the
quasi-fixed input is also used in the estimation. In the long-run equilibrium, shadow prices of
quasi-fixed inputs are equal to rental prices of capital. Therefore, differentiating the average cost
function with respect to capital input intensities, we have

where wKl ,t is the rental price for K l at time t. Using equation (6), we can solve for capital input

(7)

The intensities of quasi-fixed inputs depend on variable input prices, the industry’s output, the
time trend, rental prices of the quasi-fixed inputs, and IT spillover stocks. Equations (5) and (7)
define the system of equations to be estimated.

4. Data
The study covers 42 U.S. private industries over the period of 1984-2000. The data used
in the study are obtained from several sources. The nominal values and chain-type price indexes
of gross output and intermediate inputs are obtained from the Gross Product Originating (GPO)
published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The number of full time equivalent
employees is used as the quantity of labor. The wage index is constructed by dividing
compensation of employees by the number of full time equivalent employees. For capital stock,
we obtained investment data for 61 different types of assets from the Fixed Reproducible
Tangible Wealth (FRTW) provided by the BEA. Using the detailed investment series, we
construct capital stock using a perpetual inventory method with geometric depreciation rate from
Fraumeni (1997).
The rental price for each asset is estimated by wk ,t =

(1 − itck ,t − zk ,t ut )
1 − ut

(rt + δ k − π k ,t ) pk ,t ,

where itck ,t is the investment tax credit for asset k at time period t, u is the corporate income tax
rate, z is the present value of capital consumption allowance, r is the nominal rate of return, δ k is
10

the depreciation rate, π k is the asset specific capital gain, and pk ,t is the investment deflator. All
tax related variables are obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We use Moody’s
Aaa corporate bond yield rate for the nominal rate of return and set the capital gains to zero.
Using the Törnqvist index method, 61 types of assets for each industry are aggregated
into two types of capital, IT and non-IT capital stocks. IT capital stock consists of mainframe
computers, personal computers, direct access storage devices, computer printers, computer
terminals, computer tape drives, computer storage devices, other office equipment, and
software. 6 Non-IT capital stock is constructed by aggregating other non-IT equipment and
structures.
The value of interindustry intermediate input demand and supply are obtained from the
input-output table prepared by the Office of Employment Projections (OEP) at the BLS. The
OEP developed annual input-output tables for 192 industries for the years 1983 through 2000.
The use table in the input-output data set shows the purchase of commodities by each industry as
inputs into its production process. Aggregating the columns and rows of the use table into 42
industries, we obtain matrix A which shows the transaction of intermediate goods between 42
industries. The diagonal of matrix A is set to zero in order to eliminate intraindustry transaction.
Defining X as equal to A + B where B is the transpose of A, we obtain total interindustry
transaction matrix X. The sum of each column in X represents the total value of interindustry
transaction of the industry in each column. Finally, dividing each column of matrix A by the total
value of interindustry transaction of each industry, we obtain the backward linkages of industries.
Similarly, dividing each column of matrix B by the total value of interindustry transaction, we
obtain the forward linkages of industries.

6

Software consists of prepackaged software, custom software, and own-account software.

5. Estimation Result
We jointly estimate equations (5) and (7) using the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR)
method. The predetermined parameters, θ L and θ M , are set to be average variable cost shares of
labor and intermediate input, respectively. The industry dummy variables are introduced in the
first order parameters, α i and β l . For possible serial correlation in errors, we assume the firstorder autocorrelation in the residuals of the system of equations. In the initial estimation, the
concavity in variable input prices was satisfied, but the convexity in quasi-fixed inputs was not.
After imposing the convexity restriction on the second order partial derivative matrix of the
average variable cost function with respect to the intensities of quasi-fixed inputs, we estimate
the system of variable and quasi-fixed input intensity equations. The parameter estimates are
shown in Table 3.

[Table 3]

IT Spillover Effect

Using the parameter estimates in Table 3, we estimate the short-run and long-run
elasticities with respect to IT spillover stocks. Differentiating the average variable cost in
equation (4) with respect to SOB and SOF and multiplying

SOh
, we can obtain short-run
cv

spillover elasticities of average variable cost. Omitting time subscripts for simplicity, we have

where ε cv SO shows percentage changes of average variable cost with one percent increase in SOB

intensities by differentiating the variable input intensity in equation (5) with respect to SOB and

SOF and multiplying

Table 4 shows mean the values of short-run elasticities of the average variable cost, labor,
and material intensities with respect to SOB and SOF . The standard errors for elasticities are
evaluated at the base year using the delta method.

[Table 4]

Negative values of both ε cv SO and ε cv SO in the first and second columns of Table 4
B

F

suggest that IT spillover stocks through intermediate input demand and supply reduce average
variable costs of all industries. In other words, computerization of an industry’s supplier and
13

customer reduces the average cost of the industry. Relative magnitudes of ε cv SO and ε cv SO imply
B

F

that the IT spillover stocks, through backward and forward linkages, have different effects on the
average cost of an industry. Thirty-three industries out of 42 industries receive more benefit from
the IT capital of intermediate input supplier industries ( SOB ) than from the IT capital of
customer industries ( SOF ). On the other hand, industries such as business services, legal services,
wholesale trade, and bank and security enjoy average cost saving more from the IT capital of
customer industries.
These different effects of SOB and SOF explain how the technological opportunities of
IT can be different in the backward and forward linkages of an industry. Our results suggest that
it is easier for most industries to capitalize computerization of intermediate input supplier
industries. For example, the IT-based supply chain can enable industries to lower their materials
inventory without interrupting their production processes. Meanwhile, cost saving effects of the
IT spillover stock through the forward linkage are not apparent for all industries. However, it is
interesting that industries receiving more benefits from SOF than from SOB not only have
diversified forward linkages but also are IT-intensive industries in general. Diversified forward
linkages imply that output produced by an industry is demanded not by a few specific industries
but by many industries. Therefore, our results suggest that IT-intensive industries with
diversified forward linkages, such as business services, legal services, wholesale trade, and bank
and security, have more opportunities to take an advantage of IT capital of customer industries.
Comparing sectors, IT spillover stocks have much more impact on the services sector
than the manufacturing sector. On average, a one percent increase in SOB ( SOF ) reduces by
0.0076 (0.0045) percent the average cost for the manufacturing sector and by 0.0228 (0.0251)

14

percent for the services sector.7 The results are consistent with our prediction. Given the fact that
industries in the services sector own significant parts of the total IT capital stock in the economy,
whether an industry receives benefits generated by the IT capital of service industries depends
on how important service industries are as the industry’s transaction partner. Since input-output
tables indicate that the interindustry transaction can be mainly explained by transactions with
industries within the same sector, IT externality caused by the IT capital of a services industry is
mostly distributed to other services industries.
Columns 3 to 6 in Table 4 present the short-run spillover elasticities of labor and
intermediate input intensities with respect to SOB and SOF . Both labor and intermediate input
intensities are reduced by SOB and SOF for all industries. For labor intensity in the
manufacturing sector, the effect of SOB is stronger than that of SOF . On average, a one percent
increase in SOB reduces the labor intensity of manufacturing industries by 0.0121 percent. For
the service industries, elasticities of labor and intermediate input intensities are roughly the same
although intermediate input intensities decrease slightly more.
In the long run, the quasi-fixed inputs are no longer fixed. The IT and non-IT capital
intensities are also affected by the IT spillover stocks. Therefore, we need to take into account
the effects of SOB and SOF on the quasi-fixed inputs to evaluate the long-run effects of the
spillover stocks. Differentiating the quasi-fixed input intensity in equation (7) with respect to IT
spillover stocks and multiplying

Here we also have a direct and an indirect effect of IT spillover stocks on the intensities of
variable inputs. In the long-run, SOB and SOF affect the variable input intensities directly and
also through the changes in the quasi-fixed inputs induced by the IT spillover stocks.
The first and second columns in Table 5 show mean values of the long-run elasticity of
the average variable cost with respect to SOB and SOF . On average, the long-run elasticities of
variable cost with respect to SOB and SOF are -0.0213 and -0.0170 percent, respectively.
Compared to the short-run elasticities, the effect of SOB on average cost becomes stronger in the
long run. On the other hand, the long-run effect of SOF becomes small and insignificant except
for some IT intensive industries such as industrial machinery and equipment, instruments and
related products, wholesale trade, and bank and security. The reason for these differences in the
long-run elasticities can be sought in the elasticities of IT and non-IT capital intensities with
respect to SOB and SOF in columns 3 to 6 in Table 5. An increase in SOB raises both an
industry’s IT and non-IT capital intensities, which results in a strong effect of SOB on the
average variable cost in the long run. On the other hand, an increase in SOF increases the IT

17

intensity as SOB does, but lowers the intensity of non-IT capital, which leads to a smaller effect
of SOF in the long run.
We also find that an industry’s own IT demand strongly links with the IT spillover stocks
in the long run. Columns 5 and 6 in Table 5 show that more IT adoption of an industry’s
intermediate input supplier and customer facilitates the industry’s IT adoption. In particular, the
IT demand of an industry responds more to an increase in the IT capital of a customer industry
than in the IT capital of a supplier industry. On average, a one percent increase in SOB increases
an industry’s IT demand by 0.3482 percent, while a one percent increase in SOF increases an
industry’s IT demand by 0.5974 percent.
Columns 7 to 10 in Table 5 present the average long-run spillover elasticities of variable
input intensities. Both SOB and SOF reduce labor and intermediate input intensities in the long
run. For manufacturing industries, labor intensities decline on average 0.0189 percent to a one
percent increase in SOB and 0.0055 percent to a one percent increase in SOF , while intermediate
input intensities show relatively small reduction. For services industries, long-run effects of SOB
and SOF on variable input intensities are alike. SOB ( SOF ) reduces the labor intensity by
0.0270 (0.0277) percent and the intermediate input intensity by 0.0339 (0.0353) percent for
services industries.

Industrial Interdependence and Rates of Return to the IT Spillover Stock

We have examined the effects of the IT spillover stocks on the cost structures of
industries. Since the IT spillover stock is the weighted average of other industries’ IT capital

18

stocks, we can construct a matrix which shows how the IT spillover stock of one industry affects
the cost structure of another industry.

We can also calculate the rate of return generated to industry j’s IT capital in terms of industry

(16)

where pKi O is the IT investment deflator for industry i. Both equations (15) and (16) produce
matrices of which an element in row i and column j shows the effects of industry j’s IT capital to
industry i. Table 6 and Table 7 present these matrices. These matrices explain not only how
much the IT capital stock of an industry reduces the variable cost of other industries but also
which industry generates the biggest benefit among the U.S. private industries. For example, the
value in the fourth row and the first column of the Table 6 reports that the variable cost of
19

lumber and wood products is reduced by 0.000044 percent with respect to a one percent increase
in the IT capital stock of agriculture, forestry, and fishing. The first column in Table 6 says that
the IT capital stock of agriculture, forestry, and fishing industry has relatively more effect on the
variable cost of food and kindred products and real estate than on other industries. Table 6 also
suggests that the IT capital stock of the industries such bank and security, business services,
wholesale and retail trade, and real estate play a key role in reducing the variable cost of other
industries.
Using the matrix for the rate of return in Table 7, we can explore give and take
relationships between industries. For example, industry i receives benefits from the IT capital of
its customer and supplier industries. On the other hand, industry i’s IT capital itself generates
some returns to its customer and supplier industries. The first column in Table 8 shows, on
average, returns to an industry received from a one dollar increase in the capital stock of other
industries. Industries such as bank and security, wholesale trade, and business services receive
larger returns than other industries. Within the manufacturing sector, industrial machinery and
equipment and electronic and other electric equipment seem to get more benefits. The common
characteristics of these beneficiary industries is that they are intensive users of IT capital. This
implies that the external return to an industry may depend on the industry’s own IT capital. The
second column in Table 8 shows returns that a one dollar increase in the IT capital stock of an
industry generates to other industries on average. It seems that industries receiving large returns
also generate large returns to other industries. The biggest benevolent industry is business
services. Comparing the first and second columns, we can observe that some industries receive
more than what they give to other industries. For instance, the return that bank and security
receives is four times larger than what it gives to other industries. In general, industries which

20

receive more returns than what their IT capital stocks generate to other industries are
concentrated in the services sector, such as bank and security, wholesale trade, and
communication.

TFP Decomposition

The conventional measure of TFP for a single output technology is defined as the ratio of
output over the Divisia index of aggregate input. Thus, the growth rate of TFP is written as

i = L, M , l , m = N , O ,

where a dot over a variable is a derivative with respect to time, qi is a quantity of a variable
input, and C = ∑ pi qi + ∑ wKl K l is total cost.8 Following the same method of decomposing TFP
i

l

growth in Denny, Fuss, and Waverman (1981) and Bernstein and Nadiri (1993), we can
decompose TFP growth into scale effects, IT externalities, and technical change. Totally
differentiating the variable cost function, C v = C v ( P, K , SO, y, T ) , with respect to time, and
dividing by C, we have

As we can see in equation (22), TFP growth is decomposed into three parts. The first term on the
right side of equation (22) shows the scale effect. The second term shows external effects from
the IT spillover stocks. The third term implies technical changes.
Table 9 shows TFP growth for 42 U.S. private industries over the period from 1985 to
2000. There are 23 industries which exhibit positive productivity growth during the period. It is
also interesting that 12 out of 19 services industries show negative productivity growth. As
Triplett and Bosworth (2000) pointed out, the mismeasurement of output seems to contribute to
negative productivity growth in services industries.
Columns 2 to 5 in Table 9 correspond to scale effect, IT externality effects from SOB and
SOF , and residuals.9 For many industries, scale effects explain large portions of TFP growth.
Roughly speaking, scale effects account for about 15 to 20 percent of TFP growth for
manufacturing industries. Contribution from the IT spillover stocks to TFP growth is positive for
all industries. Comparing effects of SOB and SOF , contribution from SOB is greater than that
from SOF for most industries. As we observed in the result for the elasticities with respect to
SOB and SOF , the IT spillover effect on TFP is relatively larger in the services industries than in
other industries. However, residuals are exacerbated because of possible mismeasurement of
output in services industries.

6. Conclusion
The purpose of this paper was to investigate IT externality through interindustry
transaction among U.S. private industries. We generated two types of IT spillover stocks

9

Residuals include technical changes.

23

available to an industry through intermediate input demand and supply, respectively. The
empirical results of this study indicate that IT spillover stocks have a significant impact on the
cost and production structure of industries.
We find that IT spillover stocks reduce the variable cost of all industries through savings
in both labor and materials. We also find that IT externalities through intermediate input supplier
industries are much stronger than those through customer industries. Comparing industries, we
discover that opportunity of IT spillover is larger for services industries, due to their high IT
intensity and transaction composition, than for manufacturing industries. The analysis for the
long-run effects of IT spillovers suggests that an increase in IT capital stocks of supplier and
customer industries can be an important determinant of industrial IT demands. The study also
shows that the rate of return to IT investment due to its spillover effect is considerable and
varying across industries.
Finally, our TFP decomposition suggests that IT spillover can contribute to an industry’s
productivity growth. However, we observed that strong IT externality for services industries
together with the problem of mismeasurement of their output could worsen the measured
technical changes of services industries.
