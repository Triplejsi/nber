A Gravity Model of Sovereign Lending: Trade, Default and Credit

NBER Working Paper No. 9285
October 2002
JEL No. F15, F33
ABSTRACT

One reason why countries service their external debts is the fear that default might lead to
shrinkage of international trade. If so, then creditors should systematically lend more to countries
with which they share closer trade links. We develop a simple theoretical model to capture this
intuition, then test and corroborate this idea.

1: Introduction
While the age of gunboat diplomacy as a mechanism of credit enforcement has long
passed, sovereign default is still an exceptional event. This stylized fact indicates that while the
source of a sovereign default penalty is still controversial, sovereigns behave as if they consider
default costly. Many models of sovereign debt in the literature [e.g. Bulow and Rogoff (1989a),
(1989b)] introduce explicit default penalties to rationalize this fact. These sanctions are
primarily considered to be methods of inhibiting trade. Bulow and Rogoff (1989a) discuss the
difficulties countries would experience in their trade subsequent to default, including
complications associated with avoiding seizure and the interruption of short-term trade credit.
Nevertheless, there are a number of reasons why one might doubt the existence of default
penalties. Bulow and Rogoff (1989b) themselves admit that it is unclear whether private
creditors enjoy the ability to induce their governments to enforce claims on sovereign borrowers.
Kletzer and Wright (2000) argue that most penalties in models of sovereign lending are not
“renegotiation-proof.” That is, Kletzer and Wright argue that both parties could do better
subsequent to a full or partial sovereign default, if the creditor resists levying a destructive
penalty from which (s)he would receive no immediate benefit. In brief, there is considerable
uncertainty concerning the viability of penalties for sovereign default. Thus, empirical evidence
regarding such penalties warrants attention.
Unfortunately, there are only a limited number of empirical studies concerning such
penalties. Ozler (1993) provides evidence of positive, albeit small, premia charged to countries
with default histories. Cline (1987) notes that Bolivia and Peru experienced interruptions in their
flows of short-term trade credits subsequent to debt renegotiation. In a recent paper, Rose (2002)
provides empirical support for the role of trade as a sovereign enforcement mechanism. His

1

paper shows that sovereign Paris Club reschedulings are followed by economically and
statistically significant reductions in international trade.
The evidence of Cline and Rose centers on the interruption of international trade as a
mechanism for sovereign debt repayment. If one believes that the primary penalties for
enforcing sovereign debt obligations are trade related, then creditors originating from nations
with strong bilateral trade ties with a debtor nation should have a comparative advantage in
lending to that nation.
In this short paper, we explore this idea. We first present a theoretical model of
international lending where a debtor optimally chooses its borrowing from different creditors.
These creditors are identical except that they are located in countries which differ by the strength
of their bilateral trade ties with the debtor. We show that in equilibrium, the pattern of
borrowing favors the creditor with higher bilateral trade volume with the debtor. We then test
and corroborate this idea using an annual panel data set including bilateral trade and international
banking claims from 20 creditor and 149 debtor countries from 1986 through 1999. Using
instrumental variable (and other) techniques, we find a significantly positive effect of bilateral
trade on bilateral lending patterns. That is, debtors tend to borrow more from creditors with
whom they share more international trade ties.
Our theoretical model is presented in next section. We then present the data set and
methodology and test the model. The paper ends with a brief summary.

2: A Model of Sovereign Borrowing with Trade-Related Default Penalties

2

In this section we develop a simple borrowing model in which a sovereign debtor
allocates its borrowing across different creditor nations, when default penalties are based on
proportional losses in bilateral gains from trade.
We assume that there are three countries: one borrower country, i, and two creditor
countries, a and b. Let r represent one plus the world risk-free interest rate. All countries are
assumed to be small and therefore take r as given. Lending banks in the creditor countries are
risk-neutral and therefore willing to extend unlimited funds at levels consistent with an expected
return equal to r.
The model has two periods. In the first period, the representative agent in lender country j
(j=a,b) extends a loan of magnitude Lij in return for the promise of a fixed payment Dij in the
second period. In the second period, the agent in debtor country i makes its default decisions. If
the debtor chooses to service its country j debt it pays Dij . If the debtor defaults, it suffers a
penalty equal to a fraction θ of its gains from bilateral trade with country j, where 0 < θ < 1.
Bilateral gains from trade are exogenous and equal to γ Tij , where γ is a positive constant
and Tij is a random variable reflecting total trade between country i and country j in the second
period. Expectations of Tij are unbiased and satisfy

Tij = E1 (Tij ) + ε i

(1)

where E1 (Tij ) represents the period one expected value of Tij and ε i is an i.i.d. disturbance term
with expected value 0 and a symmetric and single-peaked-distribution on the interval

ε i ∈ ε , ε  . Let F ( ε ) represent the distribution of ε , i.e. the probability that

3

ε i ≤ ε , and

f ( ε ) represent its density. The creditor nations are assumed to only differ in their expected

trade volume with the debtor country, with E1 (Tia ) > E1 (Tib ) .
The expected utility function of the representative agent in country i satisfies
E1 (U i ) = U ( Ci1 ) + β E1 ( Ci 2 )

(2)

where U ' > 0, U " < 0, Cit represents consumption in country i in period t ( t = 1, 2 ) , and β

represents the debtor’s discount rate. The specification that debtor utility is linear in expected
second period consumption is made for analytic simplicity, but drives none of our results.
Debtor income, Yit , is exogenous in both periods. Debtor first-period consumption
satisfies

Ci1 = Yi1 + Lia + Lib .

(3)

Since no new funds are obtained in period 2, the debtor’s default decision on debts from
each creditor nation is based on maximizing expected second period consumption. Conditional
on service on its debt obligations to country j, debtor second-period consumption satisfies
Ci 2 = Yi 2 + γ Tij − Dij − g ( Dik , ε i )

(4)

where j ≠ k and g ( Dik , ε i ) represents the cost of the debtor’s utility-maximizing default
decision on debt owed to country k.
Similarly, conditional on default on obligations to country j, debtor second-period
consumption satisfies

Ci 2 = Yi 2 + (1 − θ ) γ Tij − g ( Dik , ε i ) .
If follows that the debtor chooses to default on country j when Dij > θγ Tij .

Equilibrium in the model is defined as the pair of debt obligations ( Dia , Dib ) that
maximize expected debtor utility subject to both creditors’ zero profit conditions. The creditors’
zero profit conditions satisfy

D ij =

rLij

( )

1 − F ε ij*

(7)

where j=a,b.
Utility maximization for the debtor can be characterized in terms of two decisions, the
overall borrowing level, Li , and the allocation of debt across the two creditors, Dia and Dib .
Consider first the allocation decision. Given total borrowing Li , maximizing expected utility
subject to the creditors’ zero-profit conditions yields the first-order condition

ε ia* = ε ib* .

(8)

Equation (8) suggests that the debtor maximizes expected utility by allocating its
borrowing to equalize the probability of default across the two creditor nations. The intuition
behind this result lies in the creditors’ zero-profit conditions. Since the creditors’ risk premia are
symmetric functions of default risk, equalizing the marginal cost of the last dollar borrowed in
each country implies equalizing the probability of default across the two countries.
Totally differentiating (8) with respect to Lia and Tia yields

( )

Equation (9) yields our first result: Holding total lending constant, the share of lending
originating in country a is increasing in the expected volume of trade with country a.
Note that the result in equation (9) also implies that default decisions are identical expost. Consequently, let

ε i*

represent the realization of ε i that leaves the debtor indifferent

between default and debt service to both creditors. By equations (7) and (8) we obtain

The term in the numerator can be signed as positive when the utility function is not too

(13)

Given satisfaction of this condition, equation (12) shows that holding all else equal, an
increase in E1 (Tia ) increases the total level of borrowing by the debtor.
Our results demonstrate that an increase in the expected volume of bilateral trade with an
individual country is associated with both an increase in overall borrowing and an increase in the
share of overall borrowing originating in that country. Consequently, the model predicts a
positive correlation between expected bilateral trade volumes and bilateral lending. In the next
section, we test this prediction.

3: Empirics
Gravity Methodology

We are interested in estimating the effect of international trade on international debt.
However, international borrowing may itself encourage trade; alternatively, both borrowing and
trade may be jointly driven by common factors. That is, it is important for us to consider the
possibility that international borrowing and trade are simultaneously determined.
We solve this problem using instrumental variables. The popular “gravity” model of
bilateral international trade provides a wealth of potential instrumental variables. Many variables
which are known to be important determinants of international trade are unlikely to be important

7

determinants of international lending patterns. For instance, a pair of landlocked countries
engages in less international trade, while a pair of physically large countries or those which share
a common land border trade more. But international lending patterns are unlikely to be affected
by such features. We use such variables as instrumental variables for trade in a model of
bilateral lending.
Since conditions that lead two countries to be more integrated are likely to lead to more
financial activity between them, our specification for bilateral international borrowing levels
follows the gravity model of international trade closely:

ln(Cijt) = β1ln(YiYj)t + β2ln(YiYj/PopiPopj)t + β3lnDij + β4Langij + β5Contij + β6FTAijt
+ β7Landlij + β8Islandij +β9ln(AreaiAreaj) + β10ComColij + β11CurColijt
+ β12Colonyij + β13ComNatij + β14CUijt + γτ⋅Tτt + ϕln(Xijt) + εijt

where i and j denotes countries, t denotes time, and the variables are defined as:
•

Cijt denotes the value of real lending from i to j at time t,

•

Xijt denotes the average value of real bilateral trade between i and j at time t,

•

Y is real GDP,

•

Pop is population,

•

D is the distance between i and j,

•

Lang is a binary variable which is unity if i and j have a common language,

•

Cont is a binary variable which is unity if i and j share a land border,

•

FTA is a binary variable which is unity if i and j belong to the same regional trade
agreement,

•

Landl is the number of landlocked countries in the country-pair (0, 1, or 2).

•

Island is the number of island nations in the pair (0, 1, or 2),

•

Area is the land mass of the country,
8

(14)

•

ComCol is a binary variable which is unity if i and j were ever colonies after 1945 with the
same colonizer,

•

CurCol is a binary variable which is unity if i and j are colonies at time t,

•

Colony is a binary variable which is unity if i ever colonized j or vice versa,

•

ComNat is a binary variable which is unity if i and j remained part of the same nation during
the sample (e.g., the UK and Bermuda),

•

CU is a binary variable which is unity if i and j use the same currency at time t,

•

Tτt is a comprehensive set of year-specific intercepts,

•

β and γ are vectors of nuisance coefficients, and

•

εij represents the myriad other influences on bilateral credit, assumed to be well behaved.

The coefficient of interest to us is ϕ, the effect of bilateral trade between countries i and j on
commercial bank claims by creditor country j on debtor nation i.
We estimate the model with a number of techniques below. We begin by using ordinary least
squares with standard errors that are robust to clustering (since pairs of countries are likely to be
highly dependent across years). We then use instrumental variables, dropping some of the
regressors from the right-hand side of the equation and using them as instrumental variables.
Finally, we employ fixed- and random-effects panel data estimators, with and without
instrumental variables. We use both fixed and random effects estimators extensively below.

The Data Set

We use a subset of the panel data set of Glick and Rose (2002); the interested reader is
referred to Glick and Rose for more details.
For the regressand we use consolidated foreign claims of reporting banks on individual
countries. These bank loans are provided by the BIS in millions of American dollars for twenty
creditor countries and almost 150 borrowing countries.2 Not all of the areas covered are
9

countries in the conventional sense of the word; we use the term “country” simply for
convenience. (The creditor countries and debtor countries are listed in the appendix.) The data
are provided semi-annually from 1986; we average the data to annual series by simple averaging.
We convert nominal bank claims to a real series by deflating by the American CPI (19821984=1). Almost half the claims are reported to be zero. This makes the log transformation
potentially important and questionable; we investigate it further below.
The most important regressor is the level of international trade. We use bilateral trade
flows taken from the IMF’s Direction of Trade data set, deflated by the American CPI.3 To this
we add population and real GDP data (in constant dollars).4 We exploit the CIA’s “World
Factbook” for a number of country-specific variables. These include: latitude and longitude, land
area, landlocked and island status, physically contiguous neighbors, language, colonizers, and
dates of independence. We use these to create great-circle distance and our other controls. We
obtain data from the World Trade Organization to create an indicator of regional trade
agreements, and include: EEC/EC/EU; US-Israel FTA; NAFTA; CACM; CARICOM;
PATCRA; ANZCERTA; ASEAN, SPARTECA, and Mercosur. Finally, we add the Glick and
Rose (2002) currency union dummy variable.
Descriptive statistics for the data set are tabulated in the appendix.

Results

We begin our investigation by estimating (14) with OLS. Our results appear in Table 1.
Our default estimates include the entire set of regressors (i.e., all fourteen coefficients are
estimated as well as the set of time-specific intercepts). In this specification, the estimate of the
all-important ϕ coefficient is .54, with a robust standard error of .04. This result is not only

10

consistent with our theory, but is highly significant. With a t-statistic of over 15, the coefficient
is different from zero at any reasonable level of statistical significance. The effect is also
economically significant; an increase in trade of 1% is associated with an increase in bilateral
lending of over .5%, all other things being equal.
The rest of the table provides a series of robustness checks. For instance, the second row
reports ϕ if the other controls are dropped from the equation (i.e., we set β=γ=0); in this case, the
effect is even more significant. Since many of the creditor countries have not extended loans to
some of the debtor countries, many observations of the dependent variable are zero and are thus
dropped from the equation estimated in natural logarithms. Therefore, the third and fourth rows
of the table report comparable estimates of ϕ when both trade and bank claims are included in
untransformed levels. Yet ϕ remains statistically significant when the key relationship is
estimated in levels.5
The fifth and sixth rows of the table move away from panel data analysis to cover only
cross-sections for two years in the middle of the sample, 1990 and 1995. However, the results
are essentially unchanged from the default specification. The seventh and final row includes
only observations between industrial countries (i.e., those with IFS country codes less than 200).
Again, the results are essentially unchanged.
To summarize, the effect of international trade on bank claims seems positive,
significant, and robust in simple OLS estimation. The question is whether this result stands up to
greater econometric scrutiny.

IV Results

11

We now proceed to instrumental variables estimation. We use five instrumental variables
for (the log of) trade: (the log of) distance between the countries; the land border dummy; the
number of landlocked countries; the number of island nations; and the log of the product of the
countries’ area. We accordingly set the appropriate β coefficients to zero (i.e., drop them from
the equation, leaving the remaining variables as controls). The estimates are tabulated in Table
2a.
Despite the use of instrumental variables that are both plausibly exogenous and correlated
with trade, the key results do not change with IV estimation. The default estimate is somewhat
smaller, averaging perhaps .4. But it remains economically and statistically significant; it is also
robust to a number of econometric perturbations.
Table 2b reports sensitivity analysis with respect to the set of instrumental variables.
Instead of the five geographic variables, we use three whose coefficients are usually insignificant
in OLS estimates of equation (14): the common language dummy; the regional trade agreement
dummy; and the same nation dummy. Again, the estimates of ϕ seem economically and
statistically significant.6
The middle column of Table 3 adds a control for the (log of the) total credit extended by
the creditor country, as suggested by our theoretical analysis; the right-hand column controls for
the (log of) total debt incurred by the debtor country. Again, the results remain economically
and statistically significant.
Finally, Table 4 reports results when panel estimators are used instead of more traditional
regressions. The middle columns report OLS fixed- and random-effects estimates of ϕ for a
variety of different specifications. The right-hand column reports instrumental variables
estimates using a random effects estimator (the fixed-effect estimator is infeasible since the

12

geographic variables are time-invariant). Yet despite all the econometric firepower, the estimate
of ϕ remains significant; it has a t-statistic of almost 9 and an economically large effect.7
We conclude that our hypothesis that bank credit is extended across international borders
along the lines of international trade is corroborated.

4: Summary

It is plausible to believe that countries service their foreign debts at least in part to avoid
the reduced trade that typically follows international default. If so, sovereign borrowers will
enjoy superior credit terms from creditor countries for which this penalty is disproportionately
high. In this paper we have provided a simple theoretical model which formalizes this intuition.
We have also empirically investigated and confirmed the hypothesis that international trade
patterns determine lending patterns.
It is important to note that while our theoretical model was based on an explicit default
penalty, our empirical evidence does not necessarily refute pure “reputation-based” models of
sovereign debt. For example, in a recent paper Eaton and Kletzer (2002) demonstrate that purely
reputation-based sovereign lending arrangements are sustainable based upon the ability of one
nation to smooth the consumption bundle of the other over time. Since bilateral trade volume
levels may reflect inter-temporal gains from trade, our results are likely consistent with their
model.
In future work it would be interesting to extend this analysis to other forms of
international lending, above and beyond bank loans. We think this is a good place to pass the
torch to others.

In addition, we assume that the probability of default by the debtor is less than one-half, so that f ' ≥ 0.

These data are available at: http://www.bis.org/publ/qcsv0206/hanx9b.csv and are part of the International

*

Banking Statistics published regularly in the BIS Quarterly Review. For technical reasons we usually ignore a few
observations from Ireland and Spain; adding these makes little difference in general to our results.

Bilateral trade on FOB exports and CIF imports is recorded in American dollars; we deflate trade by the American

CPI. We create an average value of bilateral trade between a pair of countries by averaging all of the four possible
measures potentially available.
4

Wherever possible, we use “World Development Indicators” (taken from the World Bank’s WDI 2000 CD-ROM)

data. When the data are unavailable from the World Bank, we fill in missing observations with comparables from
the Penn World Table Mark 5.6, and (when all else fails), from the IMF’s “International Financial Statistics”. The
series have been checked and corrected for errors.

Box-Cox tests imply that the natural logarithmic transformation is quite reasonable, and that the level

transformation is rejected in favor of the log transform.
6

If we use lags (e.g., of the GDP terms) as instrumental variables, our key result of a positive effect of trade on

borrowing is not changed.
7

Lending may be motivated by servicing FDI, rather than the sovereign risk issues considered in the theory above.

To test this, we add a control in the form of the natural logarithm of FDI sourced from the creditor country. We
obtained the bilateral FDI data from the OECD's International Direct Investments Yearbook 1980-2000. This data
set is annual and unavailable for many countries in our sample, containing only some 2,600 observations. When we
add this control to our default IV regression (in logs, with controls) its coefficient is indeed positive and significant.
Still, the log of trade retains an economically and statistically significant coefficient of .62 (with a robust standard
error of .11).
