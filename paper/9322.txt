ABSTRACT

Risk-shifting occurs when creditors or guarantors are exposed to loss without receiving adequate
compensation. This paper seeks to measure and compare how well authorities in 56 countries controlled
bank risk shifting during the 1990s. Although significant risk shifting occurs on average, substantial
variation exists in the effectiveness of risk control across countries. We find that the tendency for explicit
deposit insurance to exacerbate risk shifting is tempered by incorporating loss-control features such as
risk-sensitive premiums, coverage limits, and coinsurance. Introducing explicit deposit insurance has had
adverse effects in environments that are low in political and economic freedom and high in corruption.

How Country and Deposit Insurance Characteristics Affect Bank
Risk-Shifting

Even when its long-run effects are adverse, instituting deposit insurance can
benefit short-horizoned policymakers and politicians. As long as its guarantees remain
credible, explicit insurance promises to eliminate the threat of depositor runs and to
protect depositors from harm with only a smidgen of its true economic cost actually
registering on the official government budget.
Part of the long-run cost of deposit insurance is that it reduces incentives for
depositors to monitor and police their banks. In countries that have not introduced
deposit insurance explicitly, insurance still exists in an implicit form. The costs and
benefits society experiences from either type of guarantees depend on how effectively
government regulators can control bank risk-shifting (Buser, Chen, and Kane, 1981;
Brickley and James, 1988; Calomiris, 1992; Kane, 1995; Honohan and Klingebiel, 2001).
Risk-shifting occurs whenever a contractual counterparty is exposed to loss from
fraud, leverage or earnings volatility without receiving adequate compensation for the
risk entailed. Other things equal, a bank can shift risk onto its deposit insurer in two
principal ways: by increasing its leverage and by increasing the volatility of its return on
assets. Risk-shifting is subsidized whenever the value of the explicit and implicit deposit
guarantees a country’s banks enjoy exceeds the implicit and explicit premiums the
insurer imposes on them. To avoid subsidizing bank risk taking, a deposit insurer must
monitor increases in volatility and leverage and police them appropriately.

1

The empirical literature on bank risk-shifting begins with Marcus and Shaked
(1984). Employing U.S. data and a single-equation framework, these authors use a oneyear put option model to estimate a risk-adjusted “fair” value for a bank’s deposit
insurance premium. These authors and subsequent research by Ronn and Verma (1986)
find that on average FDIC insurance was overpriced, but that the distribution of fair
premiums was strongly skewed to the right. Pennacchi (1987a and b) shows that this
skewness gains importance when deposit insurance is analyzed in a multiperiod context
inasmuch as evidence of average underpricing emerges in long-maturity models.
Improving on these single-equation models, Duan, Moreau and Sealey (1992)
separate the effects of leverage and return volatility in testing for risk shifting during
1976-1986 using a sample of thirty large U.S. banks, they found that twenty percent
showed risk-shifting behavior. Using this triangular two-equation framework and fitting
both single-period and infinite-maturity option models of deposit-insurance value,
Hovakimian and Kane (2000) examine risk-shifting in 1985-1994 for a sample of 123
U.S. banks. They find that on average capital regulation did not prevent sample banks
from shifting risk. Risk-shifting proved particularly strong for poorly capitalized banks
and for banks with high ratios of insured deposits to insured debt.
Laeven (2002a) fits the single-equation option model to a sample of banks in
several countries.

He interprets estimates of the fair (i.e., properly priced) deposit

insurance premium (IPP) as a proxy for bank risk and shows that this proxy helps to
forecast bank distress in different countries. Laeven (2002b) investigates how countryspecific and bank-specific features contribute to the value of insurance services. The
opportunity-cost value of deposit insurance services proves higher in countries with

2

explicit deposit insurance, but its contribution to bank stock prices disappears in
countries with high-quality and well-enforced legal systems.
Kane (2000) argues that the value of a country’s financial safety net should
respond to country-specific variation in risk control: differences in informational
environments and in the enforceability of private contracts in particular. Demirgüç-Kunt
and Kane (2002) contend that explicit deposit insurance generates costly subsidies in
countries whose institutional environment is weak. Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache
(2002) find cross-country evidence that, in countries with weak institutional
environments, explicit deposit insurance increases the probability of banking crises.
Using Hovakimian and Kane’s (2000) adaptation of the two-equation regression
model introduced by Duan, Moreau, and Sealey (1992), this paper focuses on how well
authorities in 56 countries controlled risk-shifting incentives in recent years. Although
we find significant risk shifting on average, our method allows us to model how the
effectiveness of risk control differs across countries. As hypothesized in Kane (2000),
differences in the value of IPP across countries are explained by differences in depositinsurance design features and in environmental measures of political repression,
economic freedom, and government corruption. Specifically, we find that introducing
explicit deposit insurance may exacerbate risk shifting, but that this effect is tempered
when loss-control features such as risk-sensitive deposit insurance premiums, coverage
limits, and coinsurance are incorporated into the deposit-insurance system. We also find
that introducing explicit deposit insurance expands risk-shifting opportunities in
environments that are low in political and economic freedom and high in corruption.

3

Regression results confirm that recent adopters of explicit insurance have done a
particularly poor job of managing the value of their deposit guarantees.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section I introduces the methods used to model
bank risk-shifting behavior. Section II describes the sources of our data and our sampling
procedures. Section III presents and interprets estimates of risk-shifting incentives. In
this section and in Section IV, the analysis focuses on how risk-shifting differs across
countries that manage their deposit insurance system in different ways and under
different circumstances. Section V summarizes our findings.
I.

Role of Alternative Deposit-Insurance Models

This section describes procedures for estimating risk-shifting opportunities at
individual banks. Merton (1977, 1978) shows that, other things equal, the fair insurance
premium (expressed as a percentage of deposits) increases with a bank’s leverage and
with the volatility of its returns. Our tests employ a linear version of this relation:
IPP = γ0 + γ1σ1 + γ2(B/V) + ε1

(1)

In this equation, B is the face value of deposits and other debt, V is the market value of a
bank’s assets, σV is the standard deviation of asset returns, and IPP is the “fair” deposit
insurance premium per dollar of deposits.
Duan, Moreau, and Sealey (1992) show that we can assess bank-risk shifting
incentives by breaking out the following pair of equations:
B/V = α0 + α1σV + ε2,

(2)

IPP = β0 + β1σV + ε3.

(3)

4

The intuition is that of a rational-expectations game: a bank sets its leverage and asset
risk, σV, with a clear understanding that creditors and regulators will monitor and
discipline their choices. Similarly, creditors and regulators expect banks to react to the
discipline they provide. Equation (2) expresses the idea that regulators and creditors
constrain banks to a limited set of leverage and volatility pairs. The slope coefficients in
equations (2) and (3) have the following interpretations:

d(B / V )
,
dσ V

(4)

∂IPP
∂IPP
+
α 1 = γ 1 + γ 2α 1 .
∂σ V ∂ ( B / V )

(5)

α1 ≡
β1 ≡

The Merton model (1) treats the insurer’s guarantee as a simple put option that the
bank sells on its assets. This formulation implies that, other things equal, the value of
deposit insurance increases in both σV and B/V. By themselves, the positive partial
derivatives γ 1 = ∂IPP ∂σ V and γ 2 = ∂IPP ∂ ( B / V ) in the linearized model (1) tell us
how much value bank stockholders might extract from the insurer by marginal
adjustments. However, in practice, the deposit-insurance contract conveys loss-control
powers to the put holder that permit an insurer to monitor and control risk taking by
client banks.
If effective, risk-sensitive capital requirements modify what we can call the utility
value of risk-taking by introducing penalties that create a negative relationship between
B/V and σV. Hence, the values of α1 and β1 indicate whether regulatory and market

discipline forces a bank to strengthen its capital position as its asset volatility increases
and to cut back its volatility when its leverage increases. A negative α1 would imply that

5

risk-sensitive capital regulation and complementary market discipline constrain realizable
deposit-insurance benefits.
Given the external discipline a bank faces, Equation (3) measures whether asset
volatility influences on balance the value of the implicit and explicit government
guarantees that are imbedded in the bank’s stock price. To fully neutralize risk-shifting
incentives at the margin, disciplinary penalties that induce a decline in B/V must be large
enough to fully offset whatever increase in IPP would otherwise be generated by a higher

σV. Empirically, if the total derivative β1 is nonpositive, risk-shifting incentives are fully
neutralized.
Thus, for market and regulatory pressure to consistently discipline and potentially
neutralize incremental risk-shifting incentives, two conditions must be met:
Capital increases with volatility:

α1 < 0,

Guarantee value does not rise with volatility:

β1 ≤ 0.

None of the variables featured in our three equations is directly observable.
However, Marcus and Shaked (1984) show how to use option-based models of deposit
insurance to track these variables synthetically. Because unobservable expectations play
a central role in term-structure and asset-pricing theories, running regressions on
synthetic data sets is a common practice in finance. Our two-step econometric models
test substantive hypotheses about asset valuation jointly with the subsidiary hypothesis
that the synthetic observations are unbiased estimates of the true variables. In our
experiments, one cannot rule out the possibility that measurement error and
simultaneous-equation bias distort our results. Murphy and Topel (1985) show that
standard errors of substantive parameters are often underestimated in two-step tests.

6

These considerations suggest that we should interpret t-values conservatively and subject
our results to a variety of robustness tests.
The first step in the Marcus-Shaked procedure is to obtain tracking values for V
and σV by numerical methods. These values are then used to estimate IPP as the value of
a put option on bank assets. The procedure begins by solving the call-option formula for
equity, E. The last step uses Îto’s lemma to link σV to E, V and σE (the instantaneous
standard deviation of equity returns) by means of equation (6):
σV = σE(E/V)/(∂E/∂V).

(6)

To establish whether inferences are robust to differences in how forbearance is modeled,
we conducted regressions using proxies for V, σV, and IPP derived from three different
models of deposit-insurance option value.1
The first model follows Merton (1977) in portraying deposit insurance as a singleperiod European put option on the bank’s assets. This model treats bank equity as the
sum of a dividend-unprotected European call option and the present value of the
dividends distributed before the option’s expiration date. The bank’s debt is assumed to
mature in one year, which is also the assumed exercise date for the insurer. The model
expresses the value of a bank’s equity, E, and the value of the fair deposit insurance
premium, IPP, as:
E = V[1-(1- δ)T] + V(1- δ)TN(x1) - BN(x2),

(7)

IPP = N(-x2) - (1- δ)TN(-x1)V/B.

(8)

In (7) and (8), δ is the fraction of bank assets distributed at each interim dividend date to
stockholders, T is the number of interim dividend payments, N(xi) states the probability

7

that the variate value x is ≤ xi, given that x is distributed with zero mean and unit
variance.2
Ronn and Verma (1986) adapt Merton's model to account for market conjectures
that the FDIC may forbear from exercising its implicit call on the put when its claim is
only slightly in the money. The RV model scales down the effective exercise price of the
put by a factor of ρ = 0.97. Our second model employs an adaptation of the RV model
devised by Hovakimian and Kane (2000):
E = V[1-(1- δ)T] + V(1- δ)TN(x3) - ρBN(x4),

(9)

IPP = N(-x4) - (1- δ)TN(-x3)V/B.

(10)

The third model also appears in Hovakimian and Kane (2000). It assigns
stockholder benefits from forbearance only to banks that actually experience a capital
shortfall. This model suppresses the forbearance benefit (1-ρ)BN(x2) for solvent banks.
The value of a bank’s equity becomes:
E = V[1-(1- δ)T] + V(1- δ)TN(x3) - ρBN(x4) - (1-ρ)BN(x2),

(11)

IPP = N(-x4) - (1- δ)TN(-x3)V/B - (1-ρ)N(x2) .

(12)

These models fix ρ at either 1.0 or 0.97 for every country at every date. Although
one might usefully experiment with other specifications, the policy implications of our
regression tests prove relatively insensitive to this parameter.
Pennacchi (1987a and b) shows that, by counterfactually presuming prompt and
complete insolvency resolution, single-period models of IPP tend to understate the
economic value that government guarantees convey to bank stockholders. In exploring

Hovakimian and Kane (2000) provide a detailed discussion of these models.

8

risk-shifting opportunities and authorities’ ability to control them, this bias promises to
increase the power of regression tests based on Merton’s minimal-forbearance model.

Sample Selection and Data

The paper uses annual data from 1991 through 1999. Bank-level data come from
two sources. Monthly stock prices and annual market values of equity are obtained from
Datastream. Balance-sheet data come from Bankscope.3 Data on incentive-modifying
deposit insurance features employed in different countries come from the World Bank
Survey of Prudential Regulations and Supervision of Commercial Banks and from the
Demirgüç-Kunt and Sobaci (2001) database studied by Demirgüç-Kunt and Kane (2002).
Country characteristics are measured on three dimensions. Repression of political
rights and civil liberties is measured by the Freedom House, which constructs a
categorical repression indicator.4 This indicator recognizes three categories: free, partly
free, and not free. The second index is a measure of economic freedom compiled by the
Heritage Foundation.5

The third index reports the perceived corruption of national

governments (CP) as assessed by Transparency International.6

This index ranks

countries on a scale of 1 (very corrupt) to 10 (not corrupt). The CP is based on surveys of
2

x1 = [ln((1-δ)TV/B)+σV2 T/2]/(σV√T), x2 = x1 - σV√T, x3 = [ln((1-δ)TV/ρB)+σV2 T/2]/(σV√T), x4 = x3 σV√T.

To scale down the number of listed banks in Japan and the US, we include only long-term credit, city and
trust banks in Japan and in the U.S. only multinational and superregional banks as these are defined by
Goldman Sachs in its Global Banks Fact Sheet (July 2000).
4
These data are explained at the following website: http://www.freedomhouse.org.
5
The economic freedom index tracks the following factors: Corruption in the judiciary, customs service,
and government bureaucracy; Non-tariff barriers to trade, such as import bans and quotas as well as strict
labeling and licensing requirements; The fiscal burden of government, which encompasses income tax
rates, corporate tax rates, and government expenditures as a percent of output; The rule of law, efficiency
within the judiciary, and the ability to enforce contracts; Regulatory burdens on business, including health,
safety, and environmental regulation; Restrictions on banks regarding financial services, such as selling
securities and insurance; Labor market regulations, such as established work weeks and mandatory

9

business people, academics, and risk analysts. Because the three indices measure related
aspects of a country’s institutional infrastructure, pairwise correlations among the indices
range between 0.54 and 0.67. Panel A of Table I summarizes the distribution of each
index and selected deposit-insurance features across sample countries.
Individual-bank data were screened in two ways. First, to be included into our
sample, the datasets must record at least three years of data on the input variables needed
to calculate B/V, σV, and IPP. Second, to guard against reporting errors in the Datastream
source, observations generating extreme values for these variables (i.e., below the first or
above the ninety-ninth percentiles) are trimmed away.

These screening criteria are

satisfied for a total of 2,255 bank-year observations. The political freedom indicator is
available for 2,192 observations. The economic freedom index is available for 1,533
observations. The CP is available for 1,401 observations.
Panel B in Table I summarizes sample coverage by country, year, and deposit
insurance status. Our sample covers 390 banks representing 56 countries. The number of
observations per country varies from four (one bank) for Russia to 309 (42 banks) for
Denmark.

Ten countries (299 observations) limit themselves to implicit deposit

insurance during our observation period. Eight more countries (351 observations)
introduce explicit deposit insurance (EI) during the period. The remaining thirty-eight
countries (1605 observations) offer explicit insurance throughout the observation period.
For four salient subsamples, Table II reports the mean leverage ratio, the standard
deviation of returns on assets, and the mean insurance premium per dollar of deposits

separation pay; and Black market activities, including smuggling, piracy of intellectual property rights, and
the underground provision of labor and other services.

calculated from the three alternative models of deposit insurance summarized in Section
I. The first column reports values for observations recorded under an implicit insurance
(II) regime. These estimates pool observations from countries that never introduced
explicit guarantees with pre-adoption observations for countries that introduced EI during
our 1991-99 observation period. Column (2) pools all observations in years spent under
an EI regime.
Standard t-tests indicate that the EI subsample is characterized by significantly
higher leverage but significantly lower return volatility. Although mean IPP proves lower
in the EI subsample, the differences in leverage and volatility broadly offset each other,
so that the difference in premiums is not statistically significant. For each subsample, the
mean values of leverage and return volatility vary only slightly across the three models.
However, the economic significance of the observed difference in leverage emerges
clearly if the fraction reported is inverted.

How forbearance is modelled proves

important in that the mean IPP varies directly with the degree of forbearance assumed.
Demirgüç-Kunt and Kane (2002) argue that many of the countries that adopted
deposit insurance in the 1990s lacked an appropriate institutional infrastructure and were
unable to compensate for imperfections in their contracting environments. For the subset
of countries that introduced EI during the observation period, columns (3) and (4) in
Table II compare results experienced under implicit and explicit regimes. The explicitregime subsample shows a significantly higher leverage ratio (9.2 vs. 8.3) and an
insignificantly higher return volatility. However, fair deposit insurance premiums are
significantly higher under the EI regimes than under the preceding implicit regimes. For
countries introducing EI during the 1990s, not only does the leverage ratio increase from

11

8.6 to 11.6, but banks show an increase rather than a decrease in return volatility and a
substantially (and significantly) higher mean IPP.

This indicates that regulatory

discipline did a poor job of replacing the bank bonding activities and depositor discipline
that EI displaced.
Table III reports the mean value of the fair explicit premium for banks in each
sample country under each of the models summarized in Section I. For each country, the
value of government guarantees increases with the degree of forbearance assumed.
Values range from less than 0.001 percent for Australia, Austria, Germany, and
Luxembourg using Merton’s minimal-forbearance model to a high of 2.943 percent for
Russia using RV’s maximal-forbearance formulation. Particularly large values are
reported for countries known to have experienced a financial crisis during the observation
period.

The Effects of Deposit Insurance on Risk-Shifting Behavior

A. Benchmark Runs

In this section, we examine the effectiveness of risk-shifting controls by
expanding models (1) through (3) to include bank-specific fixed effects and particular
deposit-insurance design features. Likelihood-ratio and Hausman tests support the fixedeffects specification over either a random-effects specification or a specification that
dispenses with bank-specific effects. Because the Merton and Hovakimian-Kane models
achieve much the same results, we report benchmark estimates for the Merton and RonnVerma specifications only.

12

Tables IV and V let us compare results for four versions of regressions (1)
through (3). In each table, results for a fixed-effects benchmark model appear in the first
column of Panels A, B, and C. Each panel explores a different question:
A. How valuable are unconstrained increases in leverage and volatility?
B. How strongly do capital requirements discipline volatility?
C. Do officials generate enough supervisory and regulatory pressure to offset the
private bonding and depositor discipline that government guarantees displace?
Panel A summarizes the benefits of unconstrained risk-shifting. However, the
significantly negative estimates for α1 in Panel B confirm that, on balance across the
sample, regulatory capital requirements and private market pressure did generate riskrestraining discipline. Unfortunately, the significantly positive β1 value in the first
column of Panel C tells a sadder story. It implies that on average outside restraints on
bank risk-taking did not fully neutralize risk-shifting incentives.
Column (2) minimally expands the fixed-effects regressions. It introduces a zeroone dummy variable to recognize the presence of explicit insurance: the “EI Dummy.” In
both tables, the EI dummy receives a negative sign in the Panel A regressions, indicating
that on average explicit insurance did not increase risk-shifting opportunities. However,
the significantly positive values found for EI as a slope-shift parameter in the Panel B
(B/V) regressions indicate that net external discipline declines. Apparently, explicit
deposit insurance displaces more private policing than authorities manage to supply. In
the Panel C (restrained IPP) regressions, the effect of explicit deposit insurance on risk
shifting is insignificant in both Tables IV and V. Still, it is only in the minimal-

13

forbearance Merton model (Table IV) that the coefficient on the EI dummy in the IPP
regression even receives the hoped-for negative sign.
Columns (3) and (4) further expand the regressions to allow risk-mitigating
features of deposit-insurance design also to influence model coefficients. The first
experiment interacts a dummy variable that is set to one if explicit premiums are risksensitive, and is zero otherwise. The regression experiments reported in column (4) look
at two additional interactions. These experiments introduce dummy variables for the
existence of coinsurance and limits on the size of insured balances. The results show that
the strength of risk-shifting incentives depends critically on deposit insurance design. In
both the leverage and the constrained IPP regressions, coefficient estimates for the
explicit insurance dummy are significantly positive, but coefficient estimates for all three
interacted risk-control features prove significantly negative.

This indicates that

contractual controls designed to reduce bank risk-shifting incentives are at least partially
successful.
The differences observed are economically significant. For example, column (4)
of Panel C of Table IV indicates that a percentage-point increase in asset volatility σV
generates a 16 basis-point increase in IPP in countries without EI and a 23 basis-point
increase in countries that adopt EI but refrain from introducing any risk-mitigating design
features. On average, increases in σV slightly reduce IPP in countries that adopt all three
risk-mitigating features.
B. How does risk-shifting change when a country adopts explicit insurance?

The insignificance of the interacted EI Dummy in column (2) of the IPP
regressions in Tables IV and V may reflect differences in economic and political maturity
14

between countries that adopted EI years ago and those that adopted it only recently. In
this subsection, we focus on the subsample of 351 observations drawn from countries that
installed explicit insurance during 1991-99. The analysis seeks to assess the quality of
risk control in these countries in terms of shifts in α1 and β1 observed in the post-adoption
era.
Comparing Panel A of Table VI with the same panel of Table IV shows that
unconstrained risk-shifting offers larger returns in adopting countries, while the last
column shows that explicit insurance reduced IPP only in countries that set coverage
limits. In the Panel B and C regressions, significantly positive coefficients emerge for the
interacted variable (EI Dummy × σV). This result confirms that regulators in other
adopting countries were unable to compensate adequately for the private monitoring that
EI displaced. The favorable effect of the Risk-Sensitive Premium Dummy in containing
risk-shifting incentives fails to achieve significance in Table VI. However, the slopeshift estimated for the Coverage Limits Dummy remains significantly negative in all
regressions.7
IV.

How risk-shifting is affected by specific country characteristics

A. Differences in Risk-Shifting Across Environments

In countries where political and economic freedoms are low and government
corruption is high, households and firms should be reluctant to entrust their deposits to
opaque banks. In these circumstances, agents that become depositors are apt to insist on
information flows, bonding activity, and deterrent rights sufficient to price the risk

15

exposure banks pass through to them. Kane (2000) argues that, in low freedom/high
corruption countries, introducing explicit deposit insurance is apt to displace more
private discipline than government regulators may reasonably be expected to generate in
its stead.
Tables VII through IX test this hypothesis with data derived from the Merton
model.8 The tests investigate the extent to which coefficients of our three equations
differ across subsamples of countries whose institutional environments differ in specified
ways.

In each table, observations have been ranked and grouped into subsamples

according to the strength of a particular measure of the character of a country’s financial
contracting environment. Each experiment is limited to countries for which the particular
measure is available. In every panel, we benchmark the risk-shifting opportunities that
exist in the absence of explicit insurance, and use the EI dummy to estimate the
adjustment in opportunities occurring in countries that have adopted EI.
Table VII investigates the effect of differences in political freedom using a threeway partition developed by Freedom House. Because this index is widely available, this
experiment includes almost every observation studied in Tables IV and V. Panel A
shows that, as freedom declines, risk-shifting opportunities increase. The leverage
regressions in Panel B indicate that, as freedom declines, private discipline tends to
increase and so does the extent to which it is displaced by EI. The Panel C regressions
indicate that risk-shifting opportunities exist even without EI, except in the economies
that show the least amount of political freedom. Again, the perverse effect of introducing
EI grows as freedom declines.
7

The Coinsurance Dummy could not be incorporated into these runs because no country in the recent-

16

Table VIII partitions the 1533 observations for which the Economic Freedom
index exists. The “free” subsample includes all countries whose score on the index
equaled or exceeded the median value of 2.3. Results differ sharply between the two
environments. In strong (i.e., “free”) contracting environments, explicit insurance
strengthens rather than undermines private risk-shifting discipline. However, and as we
found in Table VII, in poor contracting environments, EI expands banks’ opportunities to
shift risk.
Table IX examines the 1401 observations covered by the Corruption index. Kane
(2000) shows that in countries for which accounting standards have been indexed, the CP
correlates strongly with the informativeness of accounting records.

CP may also

correlate positively with a government’s capacity to collect taxes. Countries are divided
according to whether CP falls short of or exceeds 5, the midpoint of the index range. In
both regressions, benchmark discipline is greater in more-corrupt and less-transparent
environments, and explicit insurance expands risk-shifting opportunities in highcorruption environments. In low-corruption countries, while EI exerts no significant
effect on leverage discipline, its presence does serve to limit the size of the fair insurance
premium.
That explicit insurance arrangements control risk-shifting only in strong
contracting environments accords with empirical evidence on how explicit insurance
affects the probability of financial crisis as summarized in Demirgüç-Kunt and Kane
(2002). Tables VII to IX support these authors’ contention that governments should
repair weaknesses in their contracting environments before trying to establish an explicit
adopter subsample requires coinsurance.

17

deposit insurance system. The differences we observe continue to be economically
significant. For example, in Panel C of Table IX, a percentage-point increase in asset
volatility σV generates a net 16 basis-point increase in corrupt countries, but only a 10
basis-point increase in IPP in countries that are less corrupt.
B. Robustness Tests Focusing on Equations (2) and (3)

Our final experiments expand in sometimes-complicated ways the regressions
reported in the previous six tables. Both to save space and to focus the robustness testing
on policy implications, Table X through XIII omit parallel results for adapted versions of
Equation (1).
Table X investigates whether we can incorporate deposit-insurance design features
and potentially collinear country characteristics into summary regressions. In both the
leverage and IPP equations, results confirm the patterns found for individual depositinsurance features in Tables IV to VI.

However, the disruptions we observe in

coefficient magnitudes from specification to specification support the hypothesis that
unfavorable country characteristics adversely influence deposit-insurance design.
Because the coverage of individual indices must overlap, the final catchall
regressions must be run over a particularly small subsample. The catchall IPP regression
implies that when we control for levels of political repression, corruption, and restrictions
on economic freedom at the same time, EI strongly expands risk-shifting and coinsurance
and coverage limits significantly reduce it. While economic freedom drops out of the
catchall fair-premium regression, political repression promotes benchmark risk-shifting
and integrity in government curtails it.

8

The results (not reported) are qualitatively similar when the other two models are used.

18

Two-step regression model with self-selection. It seems likely that the coefficient

estimates found for deposit insurance design features in Tables IV and V are subject to
sample-selection bias. Countries that adopt features to restrain risk-shifting behavior
might have experienced less risk-shifting in any case, precisely because the overall
contracting environment in these countries restrains risk shifting. As a robustness check,
we re-estimate the coefficients for design features using Heckman’s (1976, 1978) twostep approach to incorporate control-system self-selection. The endogenous variable in
the first-stage probit model is a dummy variable that indicates whether the design feature
is selected or not. We investigate three features: risk-sensitive premiums, coinsurance,
and coverage limits. The results of the second-stage model are presented in Table XI.
Because Heckman’s method reduces the useable sample we also report OLS estimates for
the original model using the parallel subsample.9 The coefficient for Heckman’s lambda
(also known as the inverse Mill’s ratio) measures the covariance of the error terms from
the substantive regression and the selection equation. A significant coefficient on
Heckman’s lambda indicates the presence of a sample-selection bias.
The results support the hypothesis of sample-selection bias, since the coefficient
on Heckman's lambda is significant in all but one specification. However, taking account
of selection affects only one policy implication: risk-sensitive premiums lose statistical
significance in the IPP regression. However, the sample size in these runs is less than half
of that employed in Table IV. Because this increases the standard error of each test, it
makes it harder to reject the null.

9

The sample size is smaller because the first-stage probit is estimated for observations with non-missing
values of the indices of political freedom, economic freedom, and corruption.

Switching Regression Model with Unknown Sample Separation. This section uses a

switching regression model with unknown sample separation (Maddala, 1983) to test the
hypothesis that risk-shifting incentives vary with the strength of a country’s institutional
environment. The switching model has three equations:10

B V 1 = α 10 + α 11σ V + ε 1 ,

(13)

B V 2 = α 20 + α 21σ V + ε 2 ,

(14)

I * = Zγ + u .

(15)

Equations (12) and (13) are risk-control equations that characterize the behavior
of banks in the alternate regimes. Equation (14) is a control-system selection equation. It
expresses a bank’s latent qualifications, I*, to follow one or the other regime. I* is
specified to be a function of our three proxies for the quality of the institutional
environment. The sign of I* determines whether either B/V1 or B/V2 is observed:
B/Vit = B/V1it iff Iit* < 0
B/Vit = B/V2it iff Iit* ≥ 0.

(16)

This switching regression model offers three advantages. First, it estimates
differences in risk-shifting behavior endogenously, without having to specify in advance
either what regime applies to each bank or the value of the sample breakpoint. Second,
this model can investigate the individual and joint influence of several determinants of
regime character. Because environmental characteristics jointly govern sample selection,
the model incorporates more information into the process of separating risk-control
regimes. Third, the model can assess the relative importance of our three proxies for
institutional strength.
10

Three parallel equations are specified for the fair deposit insurance premiums, IPP.
20

Table XII estimates the switching model for leverage control, while Table XIII
reports parallel estimates for risk shifting. Panel A reports the selection equations and
Panels B and C present the alternate risk-control models. The coefficients reported in
these tables are estimated by Maximum Likelihood. The likelihood function is as
follows:11
L = Φ (− Z it γ )φ (ε 1it ) + [1 − Φ (− Z it γ )]φ (ε 2it ) ,

(17)

where φ(.) is the density function and Φ(.) is the cumulative of the normal distribution.
The selection equations model institutional strength more plausibly than the
catchall leverage and premium regressions presented in Table X. Every country
characteristic receives the same sign in both equations. Political repression and
corruption weaken the public contracting environment. Although economic repression is
found to strengthen controls on bank leverage, its effect on net risk shifting is less
strongly significant.
The risk-control equations confirm our previous findings. In weak contracting
environments, background controls on private contracting are stronger, and introducing
explicit insurance significantly undermines environmental controls. In strong
environments, explicit insurance improves leverage control though, on balance, the
extent of risk shifting does not change significantly.
Regression Results by Geographic Region. As a final sensitivity test, we estimate the
parsimonious risk-control equations featured in Tables XII and XIII for each of nine
broad geographic regions. Of course, in any region where all member countries either do
11

Shocks to leverage, B/V, and the shocks to the institutional environment are assumed to be uncorrelated.
Attempts to estimate models that allow correlated errors in the risk-controls and the selection equations

21

or do not offer explicit insurance, a slope-shift term for EI cannot be estimated. Table
XIV reports the results.
Except between Eastern Europe and Latin America, leverage and risk-shifting
coefficients vary significantly across all possible regional pairings. Leverage and riskshifting control systems appear particularly strong in Australia (which has eschewed
explicit insurance) and North America.

Although leverage discipline is exerted on

balance in every region, risk-shifting opportunities vary substantially. The coefficients
for fair premiums are particularly high in Asia and Africa. Countries that have adopted
explicit insurance systems in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East appear
to have managed to restrain risk-shifting incentives, but Western European countries with
explicit insurance have intensified risk-shifting opportunities to some extent. However,
some of the regional differences turn on some very small samples. For example, the
subsample of Eastern European banks with no explicit deposit insurance consists of four
observations derived from a single Russian bank. The subsample of Western European
banks with no explicit deposit insurance consists of two observations of Greek banks and
seven observations of Swedish banks. Therefore, the effect of explicit deposit insurance
in Western Europe may be driven by relatively low risk-shifting in Sweden.
In the fair premium regressions, the σv coefficient may be interpreted as a
measure of the strength of implicit guarantees. On this reading, expectations of depositor
bailouts are extremely high in Eastern Europe and Latin America and moderately high in
Asia and Africa.

Summary and Conclusions

encountered convergence problems.

Modern finance theory stresses that depositors and other creditors must mitigate
incentives for opportunistic behavior by bank managers, owners, and borrowers. To
bond their willingness to behave nonopportunistically, banks must convey to depositors a
degree of informational transparency and an appropriate set of deterrent rights. Because
individual efforts to monitor and police bank risk-taking exhibit wasteful overlaps,
efficiency demands that depositor oversight be supplemented by some centralized
program of monitoring and control. This centralized program must be able to establish,
enforce, and dynamically readjust protocols for verification, disclosure, truth-telling,
promise-making, promise-keeping, and conciliation.
In practice, risk-control protocols are imbedded in a financial safety net erected
and managed by government officials. The ideal safety net is one that efficiently
mitigates the particular monitoring and policing difficulties that present themselves in the
contracting environment of a given country. These difficulties are apt to vary with
informational, ethical, legal, and economic subcultures that govern the design and
enforcement of financial contracts.
Public-choice theory recognizes that officials’ incentives differ in important ways
from those of private creditors.

To persuade safety-net managers to make socially

optimal choices, taxpayers must be able to observe and protect their stake in regulatory
activities.
This paper investigates how well authorities in 56 different countries have
restrained bank risk-shifting incentives in recent years.

Results show that the

effectiveness of private and governmental controls on bank leverage and depositinsurance subsidies varies across contracting environments in predictable ways.

23

In any country, explicit deposit insurance threatens to displace more private
discipline than official oversight can generate.

In strong contracting environments,

officials usually manage to avoid this result. Significant portions of the variation in the
effectiveness of risk control are explained by differences in political climate, economic
freedom, and government corruption. Regressions incorporating these environmental
factors are sensitive to model specification, but they indicate on balance that explicit
deposit insurance expands risk-shifting opportunities in poor contracting environments.
Our data show that the displacement of private discipline is reduced in systems
that impose appropriate combinations of loss-sharing rules, risk-sensitive premiums, and
coverage limits.

Unfortunately, in poor contracting environments, explicit deposit

insurance has an unhealthy appeal to policymakers. Regression results confirm that
recent adopters of explicit insurance have done a particularly poor job of replacing the
depositor discipline that explicit insurance displaced.
Two important lessons follow. First, weaknesses in risk control can generate
large fiscal and social costs under an explicit insurance regime, a truth that most recent
financial crises underscore (Honohan and Klingebiel, 2002). Because the effectiveness of
risk control depends on deposit insurance design and country circumstances, in the long
run adopting explicit insurance can easily do more harm than good. Countries with a poor
contracting environment should upgrade this environment before adopting explicit
deposit insurance. Second, even in a good contracting environment, the benefits of
explicit deposit insurance depend critically on safety-net design. Risk-mitigating features
such as risk-based premiums, coinsurance and low coverage levels can curb bank risk-

24

shifting. However, countries where government corruption is high and economic and
political freedom is low find it difficult to adopt and enforce appropriate restraints.

Notes: Countries that introduced deposit insurance during the sample period are reported twice – before
and after the enactment of deposit insurance. n.a. indicates “not applicable”. In Cyprus, explicit deposit
insurance was introduced in March 2000, after the sample period. Although Thailand and Malaysia do not
have an explicit deposit insurance fund, their governments introduced blanket guarantees in 1997 and
1998, respectively. In effect, these guarantees imply explicit deposit insurance.

Evidence of Risk-Shifting Control, Using the Merton model with minimal forbearance
Fixed-effects regressions relating a bank’s leverage, B/V, and fair deposit insurance premium, IPP, to the volatility of its return on assets, σV, and particular
deposit-insurance design features. B is the face value of a bank’s debt, including deposits. V is the market value of a bank’s assets. Regression input comes
from the Merton single-period model of deposit with minimal forbearance. The sample consists of 2,255 observations covering risk-shifting behavior from 1991
to 1999. Estimates that differ significantly from zero at 5%, and 1% levels are marked *, and **, respectively.

Evidence of Risk-Shifting Control, generated from the minimal-forbearance Merton model allowing for self-selection
Fixed-effects regressions using Heckman’s (1976, 1978) two-step method relating a bank’s leverage, B/V, and fair deposit insurance premiums, IPP, to the
volatility of its return on assets, σV, and particular deposit-insurance design features. B is the face value of a bank’s debt, including deposits. V is the market
value of a bank’s assets. The dependent variable of the first-stage Probit model is a dummy variable that indicates whether the design feature is selected or not.
As design features we consider risk-sensitive premiums (column 1), coinsurance (column 2), and coverage limits (column 3). Regression input for the secondstage regression comes from the minimal-forbearance Merton model of deposit insurance. Estimates that differ significantly from zero at 5% and 1% levels are
marked *, and **, respectively.

Table XII
Switching Regression Model of Leverage Control with Sample Selection Based on Country Characteristics
Fixed-effects regressions relating a bank’s leverage, B/V, and fair deposit insurance premiums, IPP, to the volatility of its return on assets, σV, and specified
deposit-insurance design features: B is the face value of the market value of a bank’s assets. Regression input comes from Merton’s single-period model of
deposit insurance with minimal forbearance. The sample consists of observations in countries for which the included country indices exist. Estimates that differ
significantly from zero at 5% and 1% levels are marked *, and **, respectively.

Evidence of Risk-Shifting Control Across Regions
Fixed-effects regressions relating a bank’s leverage, B/V, and fair deposit insurance premiums, IPP, to the volatility of its return on assets, σV, and specified
deposit-insurance design features: B is the face value of the market value of a bank’s assets. Regression input comes from Merton’s single-period model of
deposit insurance with minimal forbearance. Higher values of political freedom index correspond to less freedom. Higher values of economic freedom index
correspond to less freedom. Higher values of corruption index correspond to less corruption. The sample consists of observations in countries for which the
included country indices exist. Estimates that differ significantly from zero at 5% and 1% levels are marked *, and **, respectively.
