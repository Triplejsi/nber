Do WTO Members have More Liberal Trade Policy?
Andrew K. Rose
NBER Working Paper No. 9347
November 2002
JEL No. F13, F15
ABSTRACT

This paper uses 68 measures of trade policy and trade liberalization to ask if membership in
theWorld Trade Organization (WTO) and its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) is associated with more liberal trade policy. Almost no measures of trade policy are
significantly correlated with GATT/WTO membership. Trade liberalizations, when they occur,
usually lag GATT entry by many years, and the GATT/WTO often admits countries that are closed
and remain closed for years. The exception to the negative rule is that WTO members tend to have
slightly more freedom as judged by the Heritage Foundation’s index of economic freedom.

1. Introduction and Motivation
Social scientists – especially economists – love to analyze international organizations and
their policies. The International Monetary Fund scrutinizes the effects of its own programs, as
do its critics. There is enormous controversy over the effectiveness and side effects of World
Bank programs, conducted both within the Bank and outside. It is thus curious that one of the
currently most controversial international organizations – the World Trade Organization (WTO)
– has largely escaped this scrutiny. There is, to my knowledge, no rigorous empirical literature
that examines whether the WTO, and its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT), have actually succeeded in terms of their own mandate, namely trade policy. In
this short paper, I begin to fill that void by providing a brief statistical analysis of the effects of
GATT/WTO membership on trade policy.1
The WTO is not only of interest because of a gap in the literature. Much of the radical
left thinks that the WTO is the source of much evil since, by liberalizing trade, the WTO
degrades the environment, perpetuates poverty, increases inequality, and much else. The right
uses the same premise to conclude that, in freeing trade, the WTO does just the opposite. In this
paper I ask: is the antecedent itself correct? Is there compelling evidence that the GATT/WTO
has actually liberalized trade policy?2
To be more precise, the question I ask in this paper is whether trade policy is
systematically more liberal for members of the GATT/WTO than for non-members. This
immediately raises an important issue, namely “How does one measure trade policy?” In fact, it
is widely acknowledged that there is no perfect measure of trade policy. This is true when one
seeks to compare countries at a point in time, and even more so when one wishes to compare the
trade policy of a given country at different points of time. As a result I look at over sixty

1

measures of trade policy. In fact, I examine all quantitative measures of trade policy that I have
been able to find.3
It turns out that membership in the GATT/WTO is not significantly correlated with the
vast majority of trade policy measures. Thus I conclude that there is little evidence that
membership in the GATT/WTO has actually liberalized trade policy. The exception is the
Heritage Foundation’s “Index of Economic Freedom” which usually indicates that GATT/WTO
members enjoy somewhat more economic freedom than non-members.

The Mandate of the WTO
Does anyone believe that the GATT/WTO has been liberalizing international trade? I
now confirm conventional wisdom and common sense with some brief evidence.
The WTO certainly thinks it is following its mandate of liberalizing and maintaining
liberal trade. For instance, the many self-provided descriptions of the WTO include:
“By lowering trade barriers, the WTO’s system also breaks down other
barriers between peoples and nations…”
“The WTO is the only international body dealing with the rules of trade
between nations. At its heart are the WTO agreements, the legal ground-rules for
international commerce and for trade policy. The agreements have three main
objectives: to help trade flow as freely as possible, to achieve further
liberalization gradually through negotiation, and to set up an impartial means of
settling disputes”
“The WTO agreements cover goods, services and intellectual property.
They spell out the principles of liberalization, and the permitted exceptions. They
include individual countries’ commitments to lower customs tariffs and other
trade barriers, and to open and keep open services markets.”4

Similarly and consistently, the third paragraph of the GATT provides motivation for the
founding members:

2

“Being desirous of contributing to these objectives [raising standards of
living, ensuring full employment, …] by entering into reciprocal and mutually
advantageous arrangements directed to the substantial reduction of tariffs and
other barriers to trade and to the elimination of discriminatory treatment in
international commerce …”

It also seems safe to say that most economists think that the GATT has been at least
moderately successful in liberalizing trade. For instance, Bagwell and Staiger (1999, p. 215)
begin their paper “The central role played by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) in shaping postwar trade policy is widely accepted.” Krueger (1998, pp 2-3) writes:
“…the growth and liberalization of the international trading system has been the most prominent
success of the postwar period … the great liberalization of tariffs and trade in the post-war period
was achieved under the auspices of the GATT …” Irwin (1995, pp 326-327) writes:
“… the major goal of the GATT founders was achieved: once again [as
before WWI], the world economy experienced expanding international commerce
facilitated by lowering trade barriers, a record that continued after the breakdown
of the fixed-exchange-rate regime in the early 1970s… the GATT process with
U.S. leadership did secure the very real accomplishments of eliminating a host of
impediments to international trade.”
“The GATT scraped along at times, but had a distinct, downward ratchet
effect on world trade barriers. For this reason, in spite of its small size and
uncertain place as an economic institution, the GATT’s long-run impact on the
world economy has (arguably) been more significant than either that of the World
Bank or the International Monetary Fund.”

The next section of the paper discusses the measurement of trade policy, while section 3
presents the methodology. The results are presented in the next section, and some interpretation,
caveats and conclusions are in the final section.

2. Measures of Trade Policy from the Literature
All agree that measuring trade policy is a messy business. Still, there are a large number
of economists who have made the heroic undertaking, usually to determine the effect of trade
policy on growth. Dollar (1992), Sachs and Warner (1995), Harrison (1996), Edwards (1997),
and Greenaway et. al. (2002) are recent example of this literature. This field has been famously
criticized by Rodriguez and Rodrik (2000), who present a wide-ranging critique of the literature.
They focus much of their attention on the issue of measuring trade policy, and are especially
critical of Dollar’s (1992) price-based measures of trade distortion and the measures developed
by Sachs and Warner. Clearly relying on one or even a few measures of trade policy would be
risky. This is especially true since Pritchett (1996) has demonstrated that a number of different
measures of trade policy are mutually uncorrelated.
I do not attempt to provide a new measure of trade policy here. On the contrary, I want
to exploit as many measures as possible that have been created and used by others. My empirical
strategy is to examine a mass of trade policy measures, and search for indications of a connection
between these indicators of trade policy and GATT/WTO membership.
The strength of this approach relies on the facts that: a) I employ a large number of trade
policy indicators that are broad-ranging and comprehensive in scope, which; b) were not created
by me; and c) were gathered or created by others for a different purpose (usually to link trade
policy to growth). These three features of the data set should reduce any bias in my study. One
potential cost of this strategy is the need to guard against the natural tendency to over-interpret
the results, since the measures are far from independent.
I restrict my attention to the 168 countries that are covered in the Penn World Table mark
6, from 1950 through 1998, since I often condition on population and real GDP per capita data

4

taken from that source.5 This is not a serious limitation; the countries are listed in an appendix,
along with the date of GATT/WTO accession.

A Taxonomy of Trade Policy Measures
Since there are so many indicators of trade policy, I organize them into seven groups:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

Openness (e.g., the ratio of trade or imports to GDP), an outcome-based measure,
Trade flows adjusted for country-characteristics (outcome-based),
Tariffs (policy incidence-based),
Non-tariff barriers (incidence-based),
Informal or qualitative measures,
Composite indices, and
Measures based on price outcomes.

Table 1 provides a comprehensive tabulation of the individual measures of trade policy,
sorted into these seven classes. The table includes the sample period for which the data are
available, the data source, number of observations, and proportion of observations from
GATT/WTO members. I now discuss these measures in somewhat greater detail; readers are
referred to the original articles for more discussion.
(Parenthetically, I note that one possible measure is striking by its omission. No study, to
the best of my knowledge, uses membership in the GATT/WTO as an indicator of trade
liberalization.)

Openness
The most obvious measure of openness is simply aggregate exports and imports divided
by GDP. This measure is available from the Penn World Table mark 6 for a broad range of
countries from 1950 through 1998.

5

Pritchett (1996) uses another 16 cross-sectional measures of trade penetration for
developing countries. These are provided for two different years (1982 and 1985) for four
different aggregates (overall, and the manufacturing, agricultural and resources sectors). Each of
these eight measures is available both for imports alone, and for total trade derived from the
World Bank’s TARS system. 6

Tariffs
A number of measures of tariffs are available. All are affected by the well-known fact
that tariff revenues divided by total imports is a downward-biased measure of tariff rates, since
highly taxed imports tend not to be imported. Nevertheless, these measures may work well in
practice. Rodriguez and Rodrik (2000, p. 316) write:

“We are especially struck and puzzled by the proliferation of indexes of
trade restrictions. It is common to assert in this literature that simple tradeweighted tariff averages or non-tariff coverage ratios – which we believe to be the
most direct indicators of trade restrictions – are misleading as indicators of the
stance of trade policy. Yet we know of no papers that document the existence of
serious biases in these direct indicators, much less establish that an alternative
indicator performs better (in the relevant sense of calibrating the restrictiveness of
trade regimes). An examination of simple averages of taxes on imports and
exports and NTB coverage ratios leaves us with the impression that these
measures in fact do a decent job of rank-ordering countries according to the
restrictiveness of their trade regimes.”

The tariff measure referred to by Rodriguez and Rodrik is available from the World
Development Indicators from 1970 though the end of the sample in 1998 (with gaps).
Alternative measures are available in cross-sections from: 1) the Barro-Lee data set (Lee’s
measure of own-import weighted tariff rates on intermediate inputs and capital goods,
constructed from UNCTAD data); 2) Edwards (1996) who collected data on total revenue from

6

taxes on international trade as a proportion of total trade; 3) Pritchett (1996) who provides
weighted average total import charges for four different aggregates for a number of countries;
and 4) Heitger (1987) who tabulates point estimates and (within-country, inter-sectoral) standard
deviations for effective rates of protection for a number of countries.

Non-Tariff Barriers
The coverage of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) in terms of total imports is another widely
used measure of trade policy. It is widely recognized that the presence of NTBs is a potentially
poor substitute for the importance or intensity of the NTBs, so this measure of trade policy is
certainly measured with error. I take advantage of the NTB coverage cross-section available
from the Barro-Lee data set, which provides information on own-import weighted non-tariff
frequency on intermediate inputs and capital goods, again derived from UNCTAD sources. I
also use the measures from Pritchett (1996) who provides analogues for four different aggregates
for a number of countries in 1987.

Informal or Qualitative Measures
A number of more informal or qualitative measures of trade policy have been created,
and I try to take full advantage of them all. For instance, the World Bank has created measures
of “trade orientation” for two different periods of time for forty countries. These range from one
(“strongly outward oriented”) through four (“strongly inward oriented”). The Heritage
Foundation has created an index of overall “economic freedom.” This measure runs from one (a
score signifying institutions and policies most conducive to economic freedom) through five
(least conducive). The overall index of economic freedom is determined by ten factors, of which

7

one is “trade policy,” also organized on a scale from one (very low protectionism) through five
(very high protectionism). The trade policy factor is primarily determined by tariff rates,
adjusted for NTB coverage and corruption.
The NBER study lead by Anne Krueger has created measures of the phase of trade
liberalization. These range from one through five (most free). Finally, Edwards (1997) uses
cross-country rankings of trade orientation derived from regression-based indices of import
distortions (originally developed by Wolf) for two different years.

Composite Measures
Harrison (1996, p. 427) describes a number of trade policy measures for developing
countries, each of which is available as a panel variable and is used by her to study the effects of
trade policy on growth. Three of these are composites. They include: 1) an index “derived using
country-specific information on exchange rate and commercial policies” taken from
Papageorgiuo et al (where higher values indicate more liberal policy; this is denoted “Index from
FX and commercial policy” below); 2) an index “calculated using country sources on tariffs and
non-tariff barriers” derived by the World Bank (again, higher values indicate more liberal policy;
this composite is denoted “Index from Tariffs and NTBs” below); and 3) a measure of indirect
bias against agriculture resulting from industrial protection and exchange rate overvaluation
(where higher means lower protection). Edwards (1997) also provides measures of openness, as
computed by Sachs and Warner, for different decades.

8

Measures based on Residuals from Trade Equations
Leamer has used deviations of actual trade from trade as predicted by an empirical factorproportions model of trade to measure trade policy. I use this measure (as supplied by Edwards,
1997). Pritchett (1996) has provided a number of variations on this theme using data for 1982
and a number of different sub-aggregates. A less structural approach is taken by Hiscox and
Kastner (2002). They use fixed country-year residual effects from two gravity models of trade (a
simple version which links imports to GDP and distance, and an augmented one which adds
measures of wealth, land, and capital) to derive measures of trade policy orientation.

Price-Based Measures
Above and beyond her three indices of trade policy, Harrison (1996) provides a number
of price-based measures of trade policy that are available as panel variables. These include: 1)
the black market foreign exchange premium; 2) a country’s “movement to international prices”
derived using Penn World Table data as the benchmark; and 3) a modified version of Dollar’s
(1992) well-known “price distortion” index (where high values indicate distortion).7 Pritchett
(1996) also provides measures of both the level and variability of Dollar’s price distortion
measure.

3. Methodology
I start with simple regression techniques, in order to see whether straightforward methods
reveal gross obvious differences in observable trade policy between GATT/WTO members and
non-members. My cross-sectional evidence is derived from equations of the form:

9

TPi = α + βGATTWTOi + Σ jγjXj + ε i,

(1)

while my panel evidence is derived from equations of the form:

TPit = α + βGATTWTOit + Σ jγjXjt {+ δ i} {+φ t } + ε it

(1’)

where i denotes a country, t denotes time, and:
•

TP denotes a measure of trade policy,

•

GATTWTO is a binary dummy variable which is unity for GATT/WTO members,

•

X is a set of conditioning variables,

•

α and {γj} are nuisance coefficients,

•

{δ i} and {φ t } are a comprehensive set of nuisance country- and time-specific fixed
effects, and

•

ε is a well-behaved residual.
The coefficient of interest to me is β. If β is insignificantly different from zero, there is

no evidence that countries inside the GATT/WTO have trade policies different from those
outside the multilateral trade system. In this case there is no evidence that GATT/WTO
membership is associated with more liberal trade policy.
I estimate β for my cross-sectional measures in three different ways: 1) with ordinary
least squares (OLS) without augmenting variables, i.e., setting γj=0 ∀j; 2) with OLS but adding
three augmenting variables (“remoteness” and the natural logarithms of population and real GDP
per capita); and 3) with instrumental variables. Data for population and real GDP per capita
come from the Penn World Table 6. Remoteness represents distance from a country to output in

10

the rest of the world. It is defined for country i as the inverse of the mean of log real GDP for
country j divided by the log of distance between i and j; Fiji and New Zealand are the most
remote countries in the sample.8
I pursue the same strategy for my panel variables, but also use fixed effects in four
combinations: a) none; b) only year-specific; c) only country-specific; and d) both year and
country-specific fixed effects.
I include remoteness, population, and real GDP per capita to account for some wellknown features of trade policy. Large and poor countries are systematically more protectionist,
as noted by Rodrik (1995) who argues that richer countries have more developed tax structures;
smaller countries may also proportionately have more to gain from trade.
My instrumental variable estimates represent a crude first effort to handle both
simultaneity bias and measurement error. I use the country’s “polity” score as an instrumental
variable for GATT/WTO membership. I take this variable from the Polity IV data set, which is
available for a wide range of countries through the end of my sample. This variable ranges from
–10 for strongly autocratic systems to +10 for strongly democratic systems.9

4. Regression Results
I tabulate estimates of β for my cross-sectional measures of trade policy in Table 2 along
with the absolute value of the t-statistic that tests the hypothesis of no effect of GATT/WTO
membership on trade policy (computed with a robust standard error). Table 3 contains analogues
for the panel measures of trade policy. Coefficients that are significantly different from zero at
the 5% (1%) level are marked with one (two) asterisk(s).

11

The impression one gets upon scanning Table 2 is one of … nothingness. There are 51
cross-sectional measures of trade policy (16 of openness; 8 of tariffs; 5 of NTBs; 5 informal; 2
composites; 13 based on residuals; and 2 based on prices), with three coefficients recorded for
each measure (OLS bivariate; OLS with augmenting variables; and IV bivariate). Of the 153
coefficients, 6 are significantly different from zero at the 5% significance level; 2 of these are
significantly different at the 1% level. The only coefficient which is significantly different from
zero in more than one perturbation is the Heritage Foundation’s index (it is significantly different
from zero twice); more on this below. Further, the effect of GATT/WTO membership is often
perversely signed. For instance, members are often less open than non-members, with higher
tariffs and NTB coverage.
The results in Table 3, which exploit panel data, are somewhat stronger. 156 coefficients
are recorded (= 13 measures of trade policy x 4 possible sets of fixed effects combinations x 3
estimation variations [OLS bivariate/OLS augmented/IV bivariate]). Of these, 17 are
significantly different from zero at the 1% significance level, and an additional 8 are significant
at the 5% level. The results are not generally robust, with one exception. The index of economic
freedom (IEF) often indicates significantly more freedom for WTO members. More precisely,
six of the twelve coefficients are significantly different from zero at the 1% level (though none
with country fixed effects). Another is significant at the 5% level, and all indicate more freedom
for GATT/WTO members. The point estimates indicate that GATT/WTO members enjoy about
a half-point more economic freedom on a five-point scale. (By way of illustration in 1998,
Ireland and Australia both scored 1.9 on the IEF while France and Italy each scored 2.4.)
Two of the estimates for the trade policy measure of the IEF are significant at the 1%
level, and another two at the 5% level (again, none with country fixed effects). The relationships

12

between other trade policy measures and membership seem even more sensitive to the estimation
technique. For instance, tariff rates are sometimes positively linked to membership, sometimes
negatively linked and are never significantly linked when country effects are included. Finally,
the OLS effects are almost always economically small (as well as statistically insignificant),
while the IV point estimates vary wildly in magnitude.
It seems there is little obvious connection between GATT/WTO membership and trade
policy. Figure 1 contains corroborating graphical evidence in the form of histograms for two
standard measures of trade policy (the Barro-Lee measures of tariffs and NTB coverage), each
split by GATT membership. No dramatic differences between GATT members and outsiders
pop out in either NTB coverage or tariff rates. Outsiders typically have slightly less NTB
coverage and slightly higher tariffs; neither of these effects is significant at conventional levels.10
Insignificant differences can stem either from similar means or large variances (or both).
Which is responsible for these results? We can shed light on this by examining Figure 2, an
analogue to the first figure that focuses on import duties as a percentage of imports. Histograms
are provided for eight individual years between 1977 (when the sample of countries with data
became large) and 1998, both for GATT/WTO members and non-members. While there are
never significant differences in mean tariffs between members and non-members, the reason
varies over time. In the early years non-members had higher average tariffs (23%) than GATT
members (10%), but the variation in tariffs across non-members was sufficiently high that the
differences are insignificant.11 After the early to mid 1980s, the differences in both average
tariffs and their cross-country variation become small, so the insignificant t-tests result from
similar means.

13

Further confirmation of the loose relationship between GATT/WTO membership and
trade policy is available in Figure 3. This presents a graphical “event study” for the effects of
accession on nine measures of trade policy (those that can be quantified over time). For instance,
the top-left graphic shows the mean level of openness (the ratio of exports plus imports to GDP)
at the time of entry for countries acceding between 1950 through 1998, along with a plus/minus
two standard deviation confidence interval. To the right of the vertical line (which marks
accession) are data for the years after entry; the years preceding accession are graphed to the left.
The horizontal line marks the average level of openness for those inside the GATT/WTO.
The event study graphics allow one to see what happens to trade policy measures for a
typical country acceding to the GATT/WTO. And not much happens. For instance, a typical
accession country has an openness ratio of 73.1% five years before joining (somewhat higher
than the GATT/WTO average of 64.7%). But five years after accession, the joiners only have
openness ratios of 70.4%. Similarly, tariffs rise (again, insignificantly) from 12.5% to 13.1% of
imports. Indeed, none of the nine measures of trade policy change significantly; most measures
are insignificantly different from those inside the system for the five years before, during and
after accession.
Perhaps a simple example can make the case clearly. Mexico joined the GATT in 1986,
at which time its tariffs averaged 6.4% of imports. Yet even five years after accession, the
Mexican tariff rate was 7.1%; Mexican tariffs did not really fall until NAFTA began in the mid1990s. Nor is Mexico special; for instance, average tariffs were higher even five years after
Colombia and Venezuela acceded in 1981 and 1990 respectively.
It seems that none of the 64 measures of trade policy is strongly and consistently tied to
GATT/WTO membership, with the exception of the index of economic freedom. The majority

14

of the coefficients linking trade policy to membership are small; not many more coefficients are
significantly different from zero than would be expected if the true effect of membership on
policy is nil.12 To summarize, any effect that the WTO has (and the GATT had) on trade policy
is either subtle or weak.13

Liberalization Results
The previous section examined the linkage between the levels of trade policy and
membership in the GATT/WTO. More evidence is available by looking at dramatic regime
changes in trade policy – liberalizations – and membership. I now pursue this tack briefly.
Table 4a presents the developing countries described as “closed” by Sachs and Warner
(1995). It is interesting to note that 28 of the 35 closed developing countries were in the GATT
at the time the list was composed in late 1994; most of these had been members for over twenty
years. That is, the GATT repeatedly admitted countries that were closed (at least by the SachsWarner criteria) and remained closed following entry.
Table 4b lists 22 countries classified as “developed” by Sachs and Warner; I also tabulate
the Sachs-Warner year of opening and the year the country acceded to the GATT. Two of the
countries remained closed, though both are members of the GATT/WTO. Of the remaining
twenty, Spain and Switzerland liberalized before acceding to the GATT. Nearly all the others
liberalized after acceding, with the average lag being a decade (the United States is the
exception, being a founder of the GATT in 1948 and being open no later than 1950 according to
Sachs and Warner). Again, it seems that the GATT admitted closed countries and allowed them
to remain closed for long periods of time (using the Sachs-Warner criteria).

15

Others have also created liberalization dates; probably the most well-known were created
by the World Bank (see Papageorgiou, Choksi and Michaely, 1990). The World Bank’s
liberalization dates are tabulated in Table 5, along with the dates of GATT membership. Of the
36 episodes of liberalization tabulated, two-thirds followed GATT accession, often with
substantial lags. Four episodes preceded membership and eight coincided. The average lag
between GATT accession and the onset of liberalization exceeds eight years (even including the
cases where liberalization preceded accession).
Greenaway et al (2002) use two additional indicators of liberalization: 1) the date of a
country’s first “structural adjustment loan” from the World Bank, and 2) dates derived by a
World Bank team from a set of indicators including tariffs, quotas, export distortions and
exchange rates. In table 6 I list both sets of liberalization dates along with GATT accession
dates. These liberalization dates again usually lag GATT accessions, often dramatically. Indeed,
the mean lag between accession and liberalization exceeds fifteen years for both measures of
liberalization, and median lags are longer.
I conclude that there is no clear evidence that GATT accession or membership spurred
trade liberalizations.

5. Interpretation
Perhaps the non-effect of GATT membership on trade is unsurprising. After all, the
GATT built in a large number of devices to allow countries (technically “contracting parties”) to
pursue their own policies. For instance, article VI of the GATT allowed members to respond to
dumping; article XII allowed a response for balance of payments considerations; article XVIII
allowed protectionism for developing countries; there were opt-outs in articles XIX through XXI

16

for a variety of reasons including public morals, health, security, and so forth; article XXXV
allowed particular countries simply to ignore other members of the GATT; and there was a
procedure to waive obligations in article XXV. That is, there was plenty of room for countries to
be in the GATT de jure without adhering to the spirit of the agreement. Jackson (1969) provides
over two hundred pages of discussion on exceptions to GATT obligations; see also Dam (1970)
and Curzon (1965). The WTO may be a much more serious beast; time will tell.

Caveats and Outstanding Issues
It would be nice to add more structure to the statistical model, which might deliver more
convincing results. To do this, one needs to model the aggregate stance of trade policy directly.
Most of the recent literature on endogenous protection is primarily concerned with the crossindustry incidence of protection, rather than its international or intertemporal nature, a fact noted
in Rodrik’s (1995) survey; see Trefler (1993), Grossman and Helpman (1994, 1995); Goldberg
and Maggi (1999). Better instrumental variables are desirable and might be available with more
structure.
It might be the case that the GATT/WTO has acted as an international provider of public
goods in the form of global trade that is more liberal than it would have been in the absence of
the system. That is, the GATT/WTO might matter, independent of its membership. In this case,
GATT membership (which varies across both countries and time) might not be associated with
more liberal trade policy (as I have found), but the very existence of the GATT has made trade
more liberal. It is impossible to test this novel hypothesis.
Measurement error remains a serious problem in this literature, so conclusions should be
cautious. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the measurement error here concerns the

17

regressand, not an independent variable. This measurement error does not bias regression
results, though it might weaken them.14
I have also tried, without success, to uncover relationships between GATT/WTO
membership and combinations of measures of trade policy. I estimate the latter using factor
analysis. Others may have more luck.
If – as seems consistent with much of the data – the GATT/WTO is not associated with
more liberal trade policy, why does it exist? As noted by Staiger (1995), it may be that the
organization simply coordinates trade policy without systematically liberalizing it for members.
It may also serve a role as a disseminator of information or coordinate punishments; see Bagwell
and Staiger (1999, 2000). This remains a good topic for future research. And of course a weak
international institution may be the deliberate result of its members.
Finally, the question arises: If the GATT/WTO is not responsible for more liberal trade
policy, what is freeing trade? An interesting and important question, though not the topic of this
paper. Perhaps the movement away from tariffs has resulted from the gradual development of
more efficient ways of raising government revenue, such as income and value-added taxes. The
backlash against import substitution polices may also have resulted in more liberal trade policy;
both trends are suggested by Rodrik (1995). In any case, Appendix 3 shows that there is a
statistically significant trend in only one of the nine basic measures of trade policy for which
panel data are available, once the effects of country size, income and remoteness are controlled.
And that variable – the deviation of trade from that predicted by the gravity model – is an
indirect measure of trade policy.15

Conclusion
In 1987, Indian tariff revenues reached 53% of import values. India had been a founding
member of the GATT in 1948. Yet Indian tariffs revenues have never fallen below 20% of
Indian imports, at least during the 25 years for which we have data. This from a measure of
tariffs known to be biased down since highly taxed goods tend not to be imported! Comparable
tariff data exist for 91 countries in 1987, at which time 89 countries had lower tariffs than India.
23 of these 89 countries were not members of the GATT; they had tariff rates averaging 15.7%.
GATT members collected tariffs averaging 11.4% (a figure that is statistically indistinguishable
from that of outsiders at even the 10% level). Nor is there something special about 1987;
average tariff rates have been insignificantly different for members and non-members for all
years since the mid 1970s at the standard 5% confidence level. Succinctly, tariff rates don’t
seem to be significantly different for GATT members and outsiders. Nor do other measures of
trade policy.
In this short paper, I have used simple conventional statistical techniques to analyze the
relationship between GATT/WTO membership and international trade policy. Despite my use of
over sixty measures of trade policy, I have been unable to find convincing evidence that
membership in the multilateral trade system is associated with more liberal trade policy. The
exception is that members of the system usually enjoy slightly more economic freedom using the
Heritage Foundation’s index. There are almost no discernible differences between GATT/WTO
members and non-members for tariff rates, measures of non-tariff barrier coverage, price-based
measures, measures of openness, and so forth. Are we really so sure that the WTO has actually
liberalized trade ... or is actually liberalizing it?

Simple differences tabulated for GATT/WTO members and non-members.
P-values for t-tests of equality between GATT/WTO members and non-members. Small values imply rejection of
null hypothesis (equal changes in trade policy for GATT/WTO members and non-members).
5- and 10-year changes are for non-overlapping data.

On the IMF: Haque and Kahn (1998) provide a view from inside the Fund, while Barro and Lee (2002) provide an
external perspective. Two analogies on the Bank: are the World Bank’s Annual Review of Development
Effectiveness and McMillan, Rodrik and Welch (2002). Also see, among many others, Easterly (2001).

On the left, see among many others, the website of the “International Forum on Globalization” www.ifg.org. On
the right, try the Economist (e.g., “Clueless in Seattle” Dec 2, 1999 or even more strikingly “Who Needs the WTO”
from the same issue which begins “For five decades the world’s multilateral trade-liberalising machinery—known
first as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and more recently as the World Trade Organisation
(WTO)—has, in all likelihood, done more to attack global poverty and advance living standards right across the
planet than has any other man-made device.”).

As Pritchett notes, import data may be preferred to total trade since better information is available on barriers to
imports.

I drop one of Harrison’s measures (trade as a fraction of GDP) since it is highly correlated with more recent data
that measure the same thing. The simple correlation of her measure of openness with more recent data on
(Exports+Imports)/GDP is .95.

That is, remotenessi,t =J/Σj Yj,t /Dij where Yj,t is the log of real GDP for j at t, and Dij is the log distance between i
and j.

The data set is described and available at: http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/polity/ The polity variable is
significantly positive correlated with membership in the GATT/WTO. For instance, the t-statistic for a simple
regression of GATT/WTO membership on polity exceeds 30, and strong results persist when country- or yeareffects are added. It is less clear that a country’s polity score is truly exogenous, though it is in practice uncorrelated
with the vast majority of measures of trade policy.
I have also used geographic instrumental variables (such as a country’s land mass, latitude, and landlocked/island
status) with results similar to those tabulated below.

The t-statistics for the null hypothesis of equal NTB coverage and tariff rates for GATT and non-GATT members
are .2 and .1 respectively, consistent with the null at all reasonable levels. Yet these are precisely the measures
advocated by Rodriguez and Rodrik.
11
The outlier is Sudan with tariffs of around 300% of imports.

33 of the 307 (≅ 11%) coefficients are significant at the 5% level; 19 (≅ 6%) at the 1% level.

Appendix 4 tabulates changes in the panel trade policy measures at three horizons: 1-, 5-, and 10-years. At each
horizon, a simple t-test is tabulated for the null hypothesis that the change in trade policy is equal for GATT/WTO
members and non-members. None of these t-statistics is significantly different from zero at conventional
significance levels, consistent with the hypothesis that not only levels but also changes in trade policy are similar for
GATT members and non-members.
14
One imperfect way to gauge the noise in the data set is to substitute membership in a regional free trade
association for membership in the GATT/WTO. Clearly membership in a regional trade agreement is bilateral,
whereas membership in the GATT/WTO is a multilateral phenomenon, so noise should be even higher. Yet
members of FTAs tend to have more trade relative to GDP, lower tariffs, and more economic freedom. These
phenomena are also present much more frequently; for instance, of the 12 statistical perturbation
(=OLS/Multivariate/IV x 4 sets of fixed effects), 9 are significantly negative for tariffs, 10 are significantly negative
for IEF, and 6 are significantly positive for openness.
