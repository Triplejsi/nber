Changes over time in union relative wage effects in the UK and the US revisited
David G. Blanchflower and Alex Bryson
NBER Working Paper No. 9395
December 2002
JEL No. J3, J5
ABSTRACT
This paper examines the impact of trade unions in the US and the UK and elsewhere. In
both the US and the UK, despite declining membership numbers, unions are able to raise wages
substantially over the equivalent non-union wage. Unions in other countries, such as Australia,
Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, Denmark, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal and
Spain, are also able to raise wages by significant amounts. In countries where union wage
settlements frequently spill over into the non-union sector (e.g. France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands and Sweden) there is no significant union wage differential. The estimates from the
seventeen countries we examined averages out at 12 per cent.
Time series evidence from both the US and the UK suggests three interesting findings.
First, the union differential in the US is higher on average than that found in the UK (18 per cent
compared with 10 per cent). Second, the union wage premium in both countries was untrended
in the years up to the mid-1990s. Third, in both countries the wage premium has fallen in the
boom years since 1994/95. It is too early to tell whether the onset of a downturn in 2002 will
cause the differential to rise again or whether there is a trend change in the impact of unions. It
is our view that most likely what has happened is that the tightening of the labor market has
resulted in a temporary decline in the size of the union wage premium. Time will tell whether
the current loosening of the labor market, that is occurring in both countries, will return the
union wage premium to its long run values of 10 per cent in the case of the UK and 18 per cent
in the case of the US.

On the basis of past experience it seems likely that they will.

1. Introduction
Union density has been in decline in the United States and Britain for two decades now
(Appendix Table 1). It is often asserted by commentators that trade unions are outmoded
institutions, shunned by employers and unable to reach a new generation of workers imbued with
individualist values that are at odds with the ethos underpinning unionism. But the propensity of
individuals to join unions is not simply a question of “desire” or ideological commitment. More
broadly, one can think of union membership as a good – a product or service to be purchased.
Employees derive utility from this good, as they would other services or products. In the case of
union membership, this utility can be psychological. For example, the decision to purchase
membership may be due to the desire to conform to a social norm and thus maintain one’s
reputation among co-workers. It may also be driven by instrumentalism, wherein employees
think they have something tangible to gain from membership, either in terms of better wages,
improved non-pecuniary terms of employment, or they may see it as insurance against arbitrary
employer actions. So, benefits may accrue to the individual, but they come at a cost. Employees
will purchase membership if the benefits outweigh the costs. A shift in the propensity to
purchase union membership may reflect a shift in individuals’ perceptions of the costs and
benefits attached to membership. It does appear though that the cost of union membership is
generally low. Reynolds, Masters, and Moser (1999, p. 406) estimate that the fee required for
membership is equivalent to roughly two hours’ pay per month while the cost of industrial action
accounts for less than 1 per cent of working time for the typical union worker. Neither has risen
substantially over time.
What of the benefits of membership? Perhaps the most visible and most significant is the
union wage premium or wage gap. The most obvious way of measuring the value of union

2

membership to employees is to estimate the extent to which members’ wages are higher than
those of similar non-members. This union wage premium arises because unions bargain on
members’ behalf for wages that are above the market rate. In the literature what is usually
estimated is the difference between the ceteris paribus earnings of union members and those of
non-members. That is, how much would wages change if an individual moved from non-union
to union status or vice-versa, holding constant their individual and workplace characteristics.
There has been speculation that the intensification of competition since the 1980s, coupled with a
diminution of union bargaining strength, has prevented unions from obtaining the sort of wage
premium they achieved in the past. This is the issue we investigate in this chapter.
If the costs of membership have remained constant or risen, while the wage benefits of
membership have fallen, this might help explain the reticence of employees to join unions.
However, evidence to date is only suggestive of a declining union wage premium: there are few
studies estimating the union wage premium with consistent time-series data and recent studies
use techniques which were not used in earlier analyses. This gap in the evidence is filled by the
remainder of this paper. In particular, we consider how much the premium varies by country,
across groups and through time. These issues are examined using broadly comparable time
series data for the United States and the United Kingdom1. The evidence suggests that there has
been some constancy in the premium for most of the post-war years in both countries, although
the level of the differential has been somewhat higher in the US than in the UK. We find
evidence that the union wage premium has declined steadily in both countries since the mid1990s as the economies entered unprecedented boom periods and labour markets tightened
dramatically2. In addition, some evidence is presented on the size of the wage premium in
seventeen other countries drawn from three continents – Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada,

3

Chile, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
Portugal, Spain and Sweden.
2. Background
There are two ways unions can affect wages in the economy (Farber, 2001). The first is the
direct effect on the wages of workers in jobs where wages are set through collective bargaining.
This may affect non-members’ and members’ wages. The second level is the impact that the
presence of unions has in the economy: this can change the level and distribution of wages
generally. In theory, these general equilibrium effects may both raise and reduce the level of
aggregate wages in the economy. Since it is not possible to observe the counterfactual (wages in
the absence of unions) this union effect is not easily estimable. The union-non-union wage
differential (the wage gap), defined as

∆=

Wu − Wn
,
Wn

(1)

is estimable because we observe the wages of members ( Wu ) and non-members ( Wn ). Provided
differentials are small, this expression is usefully approximated by
∆ ≈ ∆u − ∆ n ,

(2)

which says that the measured union wage gap is approximately equal to the difference in the
proportional effects of unions on the union and non-union wage. The union wage gap in equation
(1) can be usefully approximated by the difference in log wages, implying that
∆ ≈ ln(Wu ) − ln(Wn ) .

(3)

The union wage gap may reflect the direct effect of unions on the wages of unionised
workers, and the offsetting effects on non-union workers. Of course, there may be endogenous
selection into union status arising for two reasons. First, there is “worker choice” in which

4

workers only choose membership if the union wage is greater than the wage available to the
individual outside the union. It is often assumed that workers with a lower underlying earning
capacity have more to gain from membership than higher quality workers, in which case this
selection process will understate the union wage premium. The second selection process arises
through “queuing”, since not all workers desiring union employment can find union jobs. Under
this model, union employers may choose the best of the workers among those desirous of a union
job. This employer selection implies a positive bias in the union premium but, a priori, it is not
clear whether this bias is greater or less than the negative bias implied by worker selection.
Either way, if there is endogenous selection the membership mark up estimated using standard
cross-sectional regression techniques ‘can be interpreted as the average difference in wages
between union and non-union workers, but it can not be interpreted as the effect of union
membership on the wage of a particular worker’ (Farber, 2001, p. 11).
Causal inference is problematic because, where workers who become members differ
systematically from those who do not become members in ways which might affect their
earnings, independent of membership, we cannot infer the non-union wage for union members
simply by comparing union members’ wages with those of non-members. In the literature for
the United States, the problem of selection bias is usually tackled by modelling union status
determination simultaneously with earnings and estimating an econometric model that takes
account of the simultaneity. This usually involves a Heckman estimator where the earnings
function and union status determination function are assumed to have errors that are jointly
normal. This technique relies on untestable exclusion restrictions whereby variables assumed to
affect union status have no direct effect on earnings. In his review of the literature, H. Gregg
Lewis (1986) concluded that, because of these arbitrary functional form assumptions and

5

untestable exclusion restrictions, results from these studies were unreliable. Estimates of the
union wage gap using simultaneous equation methods tend to produce large and unstable
estimates. Panel estimates, which involve making use of data on the same individuals over time
and observing how wages change as individuals alter their union status have problems of
misclassification and measurement error which tend to result in estimates of the impact of unions
that are downward biased. Lewis (1986) takes the view that the most appropriate way to
estimate the impact of unions on wages is using OLS. He suggests OLS may produce an upper
bound estimate of the true impact of unions because ‘such estimates suffer from upward bias
resulting from the omission of control variables correlated with the union status variable’ (Lewis,
1986, p. 9). The assumption is that some of the wage gap attributed to union membership is, in
fact, attributable in part to the characteristics of members, their jobs and their employers which
would give them higher wages than non-members in any case. In practice, as we note above and
as other studies indicate (Farber, 2001; Robinson, 1989), bias in cross-sectional OLS estimation
due to unobserved heterogeneity may both upwardly or downwardly bias the “true” impact3.
Here, our primary concern is with changes in the union wage premium over time. We do not
seek to control for the potential endogeneity of union membership. Rather, we adopt the
standard approach to estimation of the union-non-union wage gap using individual-level data and
estimating by OLS. That is,
lnWit = Xitß + δUit + εit ,

(4)

where subscript it indexes individuals over time, X it is a vector of worker, job and workplace
characteristics, U it is a dummy variable indicating union membership, and ε it is a random
component. The parameter δ represents the average proportional difference in wages between
union and non-union workers adjusted for worker and workplace characteristics, and it is the

6

regression-adjusted analogue of ∆ . In our work, we assume that any bias in our estimates of the

δ over time arising through unobserved heterogeneity remains constant over time.
The vast majority of work estimating the effects of union membership on relative wages
has been based on US data. The definitive empirical works in this area are by H. Gregg Lewis,
(1963, 1986), the father figure of this literature4. The first of his two books measured the effects
of unions using relatively aggregated data at the industry level, backed up by case study
evidence. In the 1986 volume, Lewis examined approximately 200 studies that had used microdata to estimate the effect of unions. He concluded that it was not possible to use “macro” data
to estimate the union wage gap and that methodologically estimating an Ordinary Least Squares
(OLS) equation with wages on the left, and union status on the right with a group of controls,
was probably the best way to estimate the size of the effect. Panel estimates had problems of
misclassification and measurement error while simultaneous equation methods suffered from
poor identification due to a lack of suitable instruments. Lewis (1986) found that the overall
impact of unions in the US economy was approximately 15 per cent and showed relatively little
variation across years – varying between 12 per cent and 19 per cent between 1967 and 1979.
Subsequent work confirmed constancy of the differential until the 1990s. For example,
Hirsch and his co-authors have produced a series of papers estimating changes in the differential
over time and concluded there has been some decline in the premium in recent years (e.g. Hirsch,
Macpherson and Schumacher, 2002; Hirsch and Schumacher, 2002; Hirsch and Macpherson,
2002).

Bratsberg and Ragan (2002) examine the trend in the private sector union wage

differential in the US, 1971-99, and conclude that dispersion in the wage premium across
industries has substantially declined as the US economy has become more competitive but that
there has been only a modest decline in the average premium. Bratsberg and Ragan confirmed

7

the stability of the premium over time, as noted in Linneman, Wachter and Carter (1990), but did
observe some evidence of a decline in the premium at the end of the 1990s.
There are reasons to believe that the union wage gap might vary with the business cycle.
If the union premium comes from employers sharing rents, it is plausible that the premium will
be higher when those rents are higher, in which case the wage gap would be pro-cyclical.
Alternatively, unions may insulate their members from the downward wage pressures workers in
general face in more difficult times, in which case the wage gap may be counter-cyclical. In an
interesting paper, Grant (2001) used panel data on individuals from the CPS from 1975 to 1993
to examine the cyclicality of union and non-union wages over time.

He found that the union

coefficients in the non-union sector for the two periods 1975-81 and 1983-93 were always
procyclical and generally similar in the two periods. In contrast in the union sector Grant found
strong procyclicality in the first period, confirming earlier evidence in Moore and Raisian
(1980), but weak or no procyclicality in the union sector in the second period. We come back to
this issue later since we find evidence of a counter-cyclical wage gap in the US and UK in the
1990s.
Raphael (2000) used a sample of workers displaced by plant closings from the 1994 and
1996 Current Population Survey Displaced Workers Supplement files to estimate the effects of
union membership on weekly earnings. When models were estimated using the entire sample of
displaced workers, longitudinal estimates of the union earnings effect were found to be similar in
magnitude to estimates from cross-sectional regressions. In models estimated separately by skill
group, the author found some evidence of positive selection into unions among workers with low
observed skills and negative selection into unions among workers with high observed skills.
Finally, Wunnava and Okunade (1996) used data for men from the Panel Survey of Income

8

Dynamics and found an overall union wage premium of about 12 per cent for the 1980s, which is
a good deal lower than reported in most other studies and possibly driven by measurement error
in the union status variable. In response to fluctuations in local labour market conditions,
proxied by the local unemployment rate, they found a much more flexible wage-setting process
in the non-union sector relative to the union sector. The long-term effect of unemployment on
non-union real wages suggested an approximate 0.6 per cent decline for every one percentage
point increase in unemployment, but the long-term effect of unemployment on real wages of
union members was negligible. Wunnava and Okunade’s estimates of the union wage premium
ranged between 11.6 to 12.3 per cent for the sample period. Union wages were found to be
insensitive to short-run fluctuations in local labour market conditions, and counter-cyclical in
nature.
In the UK there have been approximately thirty studies, some based on establishment
data5 and others on individual data (including some using linked employer-employee data)6. It
needs to be pointed out at the outset that industrial relations are rather more complex in Britain
than they are in the United States. For example, in Britain many more non-members work in
workplaces that are covered by union agreements and, conversely, more union members are
employed in workplaces where unions are not engaged in pay bargaining than is true for the US.
There is, correspondingly, a multi-faceted literature in the UK which has investigated the free
rider problem (see Booth and, Bryan, 2001; Hildreth, 2000) as well as the importance of union
recognition (Blanchflower, 1984; 1986), multiple unionism (Machin, Stewart and van Reenen,
1993) and closed shops (Stewart, 1987; Blanchflower, Garrett and Oswald. 1989; Metcalf and
Stewart, 1992). (There are one or two papers in the US also on the role of coverage, including
Budd and Na, 2000, and Schumacher, 1999.) Because we are interested in the benefits accruing

9

to individuals through their membership, this is not the path we will follow here: our main focus
is a comparative one involving the benefits of union membership on wages.
The recent spate of studies that have looked at the impact of union membership on wages
has been occasioned by a growing belief that the union wage premium may be falling in Britain.
Some argue that a decline in the average union premium is consistent with diminishing union
influence over pay setting. There is certainly evidence pointing in that direction. First, case
studies suggest the scope of bargaining has narrowed substantially in companies that continue to
bargain with unions (Brown et al., 1998). Second, pay settlements in the private sector during
1997/98 were no greater where trade unions were involved than in their absence (Forth and
Millward, 2000b). Third, even where managers say employees have their pay set through
workplace-level or organisation-level collective bargaining, union representatives and officials
are either not involved or are only consulted in a substantial minority of cases (Millward, Forth
and Bryson, 2001). But there is also evidence to the contrary. For example, unions continue to
have a substantial effect on pay structures, bringing up the wages of the lowest paid and thus
narrowing pay differentials across gender, ethnicity, health and occupation (Metcalf, Hansen,
and Charlwood, 2001). These studies, which indicate union effects despite substantial declines
in union density, might suggest that those unions that have survived are the stronger and, as such,
better able to command a wage premium (thus raising the “batting average” of unions). Here we
briefly review what studies to date have told us about the size of the union wage premium over
time and across workers.
The consensus in the earlier literature was that the mean union wage gap was
approximately 10 per cent (Blanchflower, 1999). Despite the rapid decline in union density
experienced in the UK since 1979, there was evidence to suggest that the gap remained roughly

10

constant from 1970 – the year for which the earliest estimate is available (Shah, 1984) – to 1995
(see Blanchflower, 1999). However, there is some dispute on this question, with some studies
pointing to trends in either direction. For instance, establishment-level analyses indicated that
the union wage premium in the early 1980s was most evident where unions were strong, as
indicated by the presence of a closed shop (Stewart, 1987). This premium seems to have
declined in the second half of the 1980s, a trend which has been attributed to a decline in the
incidence and impact of the closed shop, coupled with unions’ inability to establish differentials
in new workplaces (Stewart, 1995). On the other hand, Andrews, Bell and Upward (1998) find
the bargaining coverage differential over the period 1975-1994 moved counter-cyclically, with
an underlying upward trend which they attribute to the decentralisation of pay bargaining. In
addition to cross-sectional estimates, there has been a series of papers producing estimates for
this period based on longitudinal data for Britain using the British Household Panel Survey
(Blanchflower, 1999; Hildreth, 1999; Swaffield, 2001; Machin, 2001). As noted earlier, and as
both Lewis (1986) and Freeman (1984) pointed out, these estimates tend to be below the
estimates obtained by OLS because of a downward bias induced by measurement error in the
classification of union status. As also noted earlier, OLS estimates may be upwardly biased if
unobserved heterogeneity accounts for some of wage variation attributed to union membership.
Thus, for example, in Blanchflower (1999) the OLS estimate for the years 1991-93 was 10.6 per
cent compared with 3.7 per cent when a full set of people fixed effects were included.7 As
Freeman (1984, p. 24) has suggested, it may well be that the cross-section and fixed effect or
“panel” estimates of the impact of unions on wages ‘bound the true impact of unionism’.
Studies using individual pay data covering the first half of the 1990s also suggested that,
while the union effect was persisting, the premium declined for some workers (Blanchflower,

11

1999; Hildreth, 1999). For example, Hildreth (1999, p. 7) argues that stability in the union
premium for blue-collar male workers in 1991-95 compared with a declining premium for their
white-collar counterparts may reflect their respective abilities to maintain their bargaining power.
The picture emerging from research through to 1998/99 is suggestive of a more widespread
decline in the premium.

Machin’s (2001) analysis of longitudinal data from the British

Household Panel Survey indicates that, although there was a wage gain for people moving into
union jobs in the early 1990s, this had disappeared by the late 1990s. Booth and Bryan (2001)
using linked employer-employee data for 1998 also found no significant wage premium. Bryson
(2002) finds a membership premium for covered workers, but it is much smaller than the 10 per
cent common in the literature. Furthermore, the premium is confined to employees in older
workplaces and those with high union density. Forth and Millward (2000a) find the premium
was confined to workers in workplaces with high bargaining coverage or multiple unions.
It would be hasty to assert, on the basis of this evidence alone, that unions’ ability to
secure better than market rates for their workers has declined since the 1980s because
methodological and data differences across studies make comparisons extremely difficult
(Andrews et al., 1998). It is even more difficult to establish what has happened to the trend over
time. As Lanot and Walker (1998, p. 343) note: ‘the existing literature says little about how the
differential has changed over time there are so few studies it is difficult to take a view of whether
there is any systematic movement over time’. For instance, using standard regression techniques
deployed in most studies, Booth and Bryan (2001, p. 12) identify a membership premium of
roughly 10 per cent. Bryson reports a similar regression-adjusted premium for the private sector
(2002, p. 25). However, in both cases, the authors lay emphasis on the results they obtain

12

through the use of other techniques (instrumental variables in the case of Booth and Bryan and
propensity score matching in Bryson’s case).
The disaggregated pattern of results reported by Lewis (1986) for the US appear to be
broadly repeated for the UK. The main exception is that the wage gap in the UK appears to be
larger for females than it is for males (see Blanchflower, 1999; Main, 1996). We explore this
issue in more detail below.
In what follows a series of estimates for the union wage gap since 1973 are presented.
What is the size of the union wage gap in the UK and the US in the twenty-first century? How
much has it changed in the years since 1980, which is the end-point for Lewis’ 1986 study?
How much do the estimates vary by gender, race and across the public and private sectors? How
large is the wage gap in other countries?

In the following three sections, micro-data on

individuals are used to estimate log hourly earnings equations first for a group of seventeen
countries and then for the US and the UK. In the case of the US and the UK data are available
over time that allow us to examine the time series properties of the union wage premium.
Clearly, one would wish to examine the extent to which unions are able to influence the total
compensation package including fringe benefits. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about
the extent to which unions are able to influence fringe benefits, primarily because of a lack of
suitable data. Such literature as does exist – most of which is for the US – suggests that these
effects are large (see Freeman and Medoff, 1984, for the US; and Renaud, 1998, for Canada).
For Britain, Forth and Millward (2000a) find unions enhance pension and sick pay provision in
similar circumstances to those where they affect pay.
information that permit us to examine this issue over time.

But our data files do not contain

13

Before moving to estimating union wage gaps, it is appropriate to place these results in
the wider context of the changes in the labour market experience of the two countries over the
last couple of decades; specifically, in terms of unemployment and employment; wage
inequality, real wage growth and union density. This allows for some appreciation of the climate
in which unions have been operating.
1. Unemployment was generally higher in the US than it was in the UK from 1965 to 1980. The
picture reversed itself in the later period, 1980-99. In 2000 and 2001 the unemployment rate in
the UK was below that of the United States, averaging 3.4 per cent and 4.4 per cent, respectively
(see Appendix Table 1). Both employment and the size of the labour force increased rapidly
over the period 1990-2000 in the US. Over this period, employment in the US increased by 14
per cent while the labour force increased by 12 per cent8. The UK experienced smaller growth
along both of these dimensions, with respective growth rates of 7 per cent and 3 per cent9.
2. Levels of earnings and wage inequality are high in the US and the UK compared with most
other countries, and especially so in comparison with most European countries (Blanchflower,
2000). There was substantial growth in earnings inequality in the 1970s and 1980s in the US.
Since the early 1970s earnings in the US have become much more unequal between more-skilled
and less-skilled workers as well as between workers with high and low levels of education and
those with many years of labour market experience compared to those with few. For example, in
1979 male college-educated workers earned on average 30 per cent more than male high-schooleducated workers. By 1995 this premium for college-educated workers had risen to about 70 per
cent (Blanchflower, 2000). Earnings inequality declined in the UK in the 1970s but increased in
the 1980s. Only Britain and the United States have continued to experience a rapid rise in
inequality into the 1990s, albeit at a slower rate than had occurred in the 1980s. There is much

14

less evidence of rising wage inequality in other countries (see the various papers in Freeman and
Katz, 1995). Blanchflower (2000), for example, found that from 1973-1994/95 at the lower part
of the distribution, the earnings of the median worker rose a lot in comparison to the worker at
the first decile only in the UK and the US from a group of fifteen countries (Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Sweden, the UK and the US). Appendix Table 2 presents four measures of inequality
for most of these countries at various points in time, using data from the Luxembourg Income
Study. The measures reported are the Gini coefficient as well as the 90/10, 80/20 and 90/50
differentials. The table confirms the high levels of inequality in the US and the UK compared to
other countries.
3. In the United States real wage growth has been much greater at the top of the earnings
distribution than at the bottom. In the hundred years to 1973, real average hourly earnings rose
by 1.9 per cent a year. Between 1973 and 1997, CPI-deflated real wages have fallen by about
0.4 per cent a year. The combination of flat average wages and rising inequality means that large
numbers of American workers have experienced stagnation or even absolute declines in their real
earnings in recent decades. And workers at the low end of the earnings distribution have
suffered the most, particularly those in the lowest decile. For example, the real hourly earnings
of high-school-educated males fell by 20 per cent from 1979 to 1993.10

In contrast, there has

been considerable growth in real earnings at the top of the earnings distribution.

Senior

managers and executives have experienced large increases in real earnings over the last couple of
decades, and especially so when total compensation including stock options are included.
In contrast to the United States, in most OECD countries (including the UK) there has
been strong real earnings growth across the wage distribution. For only one or two countries

15

(New Zealand and Australia) has a rise in earnings inequality implied weak growth or even
declining real wages for workers at the bottom half of the earnings distribution11. The low-paid
in most industrial countries have experienced real earnings growth over the last two decades12.
In a comparison of seven OECD countries (Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Sweden,
the UK and the US), using data from the Luxembourg Income Study for the 1980s, Gottschalk
(1993) shows that only in the US did the inequality of family income rise more than the
inequality of earnings.

In these countries, government actions through social expenditures

mitigated somewhat the impact of increasing wage inequality.
4. Union density rates declined steadily in the US from 197013. In Britain density increased in
the 1970s and then declined dramatically. Appendix Table 1 provides the background data. Since
1991, there has been a decrease in union membership of 1.3 million, a fall over the ten-year
period of 15 per cent. The fall in union membership has been steeper for men than for women
over the past decade: union density for men was 42 per cent in 1991 and 29 per cent in 2001,
whereas that for women was 32 per cent in 1991 and 28 per cent in 2001. There has been an
even more pronounced decline in unionisation in Australia, where union density was 45.6 per
cent in 1986 but only 28.1 per cent in 1998. Moreover, Australian union density continues to
fall, with the latest estimate being 24.5 per cent14.

The decline in density has also been

pronounced in Japan and Austria. Some countries, including Denmark, Finland and Sweden,
actually experienced increases in density over the period. (For a discussion, see Blanchflower
and Freeman, 1992; Blanchflower, 1996; Ebbinghaus and Visser, 1999, 2000.)
Section 3 sets the scene by presenting evidence on the size of union wage premia in
seventeen countries. In section 4 we make use of data from the Current Population Survey
(CPS) to obtain estimates of the impact of trade unions on hourly earnings for the US. In section

16

5 data from the UK Labour Force and British Social Attitudes Surveys are used for direct
comparison with the US experience. Section 6 discusses the cyclical nature of the wage gap in
the US and UK, and Section 7 presents our conclusions.
3. Union wage differentials around the world
Over the past couple of decades there has been a growing body of literature estimating
the size of the union wage gap outside the UK and the US. There are a number of studies for
Canada which suggest that the union wage gap is in the 10-15 per cent range (Doiron and
Riddell, 1994; Robinson and Tomes, 1984; MacDonald and Evans, 1981; Lemieux, 1998; Kuhn
and Sweetman, 1998, 1999; Donald, Green and Parsch, 2000; DiNardo and Lemieux, 1997).
This estimate appears to have remained fairly constant over time15. Renaud (1998) provided the
first empirical evidence of the impact of unions on benefits and total compensation in Canada
using micro data from the Canadian General Social Survey (GSS) of 1989. His results suggest
that the Canadian unions increased total compensation by 12.4 per cent, compared to an impact
of 10.4 per cent on wages. Even though the union impact on total compensation is 2 per cent
greater than the impact on wages, given that benefits comprise only about 6 per cent of total
compensation in this sample, the percentage impact of unions on benefits is estimated to be 45.5
per cent. This latter estimate implies a very substantial impact of unions on benefits in Canada,
as large or larger than estimates for the US.
In Australia the range is generally estimated to be between 7 and 17 per cent, with most
estimates at the lower end of the range16. Blanchflower and Machin (1996) provide estimates of
union wage premia for Australia using the 1989/90 Australian Workplace Industrial Relations
Survey (AWIRS90) where the establishment is the unit of observation. They found significant
wage differentials for labourers and unskilled workers of 15.6 per cent but no evidence of

17

significant differentials in respect of plant and machine operators, sales and personal service
workers, clerks, tradespersons, para-professionals or professionals – along with evidence of a
negative differential for managers. More recently, Miller and Mulvey (1996) have reported
evidence that union premia in Australia are small. Using individual level data from the 1993
Survey of Training and Education, they calculate the union wage effect to be 2.6 per cent for
men and 1.6 per cent for women. Wooden (2001, p. 2) takes exception to this result and argues
that previous research has understated the impact of unions ‘by focusing on differences across
individuals rather than differences across bargaining units’. Using data on 11,840 individual
workers from 1,357 workplaces in the 1995 Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey
(AWIRS95), Wooden showed that simply including a union membership dummy produces
insignificant differentials for both men and women17. However, Wooden found that at those
workplaces where the majority of workers were covered by collective agreements a strong union
presence conferred a wage advantage of the order of 15 to 17 per cent to members and nonmembers alike relative to workers in workplaces where collective agreements had not been
negotiated and where union wage effects were found to be small and insignificant. This does
seem to make some sense because in Australia union negotiated agreements and awards typically
apply to both members and non-members within the same workplace, and in the case of awards
to all workers within the same industry. Further, Wooden and Bora (1998) use the AWIRS95
data file and find that the wage premium associated with union membership in unionised
workplaces (compared with non-union workplaces) is as high as 7.7 per cent. They found this
was only the case where (a) all workers at the workplace were union members and (b) where the
union was relatively ‘active’. (An ‘active union’ is defined as one in which the senior delegate
from the union with most members spends one hour or more each week on union activities, and

18

where a general meeting of members is held at least once every six months or delegates meet
regularly with management.)
Moll (1993) estimated the 1985 union premium in South Africa at 24 per cent for black
blue-collar workers (19 per cent for black males and 31 per cent for black females) and 13 per
cent for whites. Schultz and Mwabu (1998) found that among male African workers in the
bottom decile of the wage distribution, union membership was associated with wages that were
145 per cent higher than those of comparable non-union workers; among those in the top decile,
the differential was 19 per cent.

For South Korea, Park (1991) obtained estimates of 4.2 per

cent for men and 5 per cent for women. Wagner (1991) found significant positive union effects
for blue-collar workers in Germany, while Schmidt (1995) found small but significant wage
differentials of less than 6 per cent. Neither Schmidt (1995) nor Schmidt and Zimmermann
(1991) were able to find evidence of significant union wage gaps in Germany for male workers.
(Table 1 near here)
In Table 1 we estimate union wage gaps for seventeen countries from three continents –
Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden18. The data used are from the
1994-99 International Social Survey Program (ISSP)19. The dependent variable is the log of
earnings/wages/income with the exact measure used being variously defined across countries but
consistent over time. Included in each equation is a restricted set of controls: age, age squared,
years of schooling, private sector, and union status. The samples are restricted to employees
only. The small number of controls will imply that the estimated union effects reported here are
biased. Given that the same controls are used in each country in each year, our best hope is that
such biases are constant over space and time. The quality and size of the data files are not

19

comparable to those we use below for the US and the UK, and for that reason the reader is
warned be cautious in interpreting these cross-country results.

The (unweighted) average

differential across these countries is 12.1 per cent.
Countries appear to fall into three groups. The first group of just two countries has a
wage differential in excess of 20 per cent, namely, Brazil (40 per cent) and Japan (29 per cent).
The second group of ten countries have more modest, but still material, differentials of around 10
per cent – Australia (13 per cent), Austria (16 per cent), Canada (9 per cent), Chile (17 per cent),
Cyprus (15 per cent), Denmark (17 per cent), New Zealand (10 per cent), Norway (8 per cent),
Portugal (20 per cent) and Spain (7 per cent). Trade unions in the final group of five countries
have no measured impact on the wage – France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden.
In these countries, the union wage gap is zero primarily due to the fact that unions are also able
to control wage outcomes in the non-union sector.
(Table 2)
Panels (a) and (b) of Table 2, which report union density rates for these countries and
chart how they have changed over time, suggest a helpful way of classifying the observed
differences in wage premia.
1. Two countries with dramatic declines in density – Austria and Japan – have estimated
differentials in double digits. (Below we shall show the UK and the US are similar.) In the case
of Austria, it seems that a big increase in inequality accompanied this decline in unionisation (see
Appendix Table 2). Australia and New Zealand have declining density and a positive union
wage differential, although it should be noted that the decline in unionisation in New Zealand is
a very recent phenomenon (see Maloney and Savage, 1996; Maloney, 1998). Portugal also has
declining unionisation rates and a sizeable wage gap (see Blanchflower, 2001).

20

2. The distinguishing feature of the group of countries that have union wage premia of zero –
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden – is high levels of union coverage, and unions’
ability to influence wage setting in the non-union sector by extension of collectively bargained
rates. (France is an exception in that it has very low union membership rates but approximately
100 per cent coverage.) It is also clear from Appendix Table 2 that, with the exception of Italy,
income inequality is low in these countries.
3. Four countries with significant differentials – Canada, Denmark, Norway and Spain – have all
had constant or rising levels of union density over the last few decades20.
4. Little is known about the labour market in Cyprus or Chile. According to our ISSP files, union
density averaged 62 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, in the two countries over the sample
years.
5. The large estimate for Brazil is based on a single year of data with few controls and less than
1,000 observations and should be interpreted with caution.
We now turn to an examination of union wage premia in the US and the UK, for which
countries we have better quality data and more data points. The data will also permit us to
examine movements in differentials over time.
4. Union wage differentials for the United States
Table 3 presents estimates of the wage gap using separate log hourly earnings equations for each
of the years from 1973 to 1981 using the National Bureau of Economic Research’s (NBER) May
Earnings Supplements to the Current Population Survey (CPS)21 and for the years since then
using data from the NBER’s Matched Outgoing Rotation Group (MORG) files of the CPS22.
The MORG data for the years 1983-1995 were previously used in Blanchflower (1999)23. For
both the May and the MORG files a broadly similar, but not identical, list of control variables is

21

used, including a union status dummy, age and its square, a gender dummy, education, race and
hours controls plus state and industry dummies24.
(Table 3 near here)
The first and third columns of Table 3 report the union coefficient in log hourly earnings
equations for the total sample and the private sector, respectively. Hirsch and Schumacher
(2002) have recently shown that there is what they call a ‘match bias’ in union wage gap
estimates due to earnings imputations25. They show that this bias arises because currently 30 per
cent of workers in the Current Population Survey have earnings imputed using a “cell hot deck”
method. This means that wage gap estimates are biased downward when the attribute being
studied (e.g. union status) is not a criterion used in the imputation. They show that standard union
wage gap estimates such as reported in Blanchflower (1999) are understated by about 3 to 5
percentage points as a result of including individuals who have had their earnings imputed. By
construction, then, the individuals with imputed earnings have a union wage gap of zero; hence
omitting them raises the size of the union wage gap. Unfortunately, it is not a simple matter to
exclude those individuals with imputed earnings in a consistent way over time26. Here we follow
the procedure suggested by Hirsch and Schumacher (2002). All allocated earners are identified
and excluded for the years 1983-88 and 1996-2001 in the MORG files. For 1989-95, allocation
flags are either unreliable (in 1989-93) or not available (1994 through August 1995). For 198993, the gaps are adjusted upward by the average imputation bias during 1983-88. For 1994-95,
the gap is adjusted upward by the bias during 1996-98. Because the May CPS sample files
available to us do not include allocated earnings in 1973-81, the series are adjusted upward by
the average bias (of .033) found by Hirsch and Schumacher using these May CPS data for 197981. Time-consistent estimates of union wage gaps, with match bias removed, are presented for

22

1973-2001 in the second and fourth columns of Table 3 for the economy as a whole and for the
private sector, respectively. These estimates are larger than those reported in the first and third
columns of the table, which included individuals with imputed earnings27. In each year there are
approximately 160,000 observations for the US economy and 130,000 for the private sector in
the MORG; in the May files, sample sizes are approximately 38,000 and 31,000 respectively
until 1980 and 1981 when sample sizes fall to approximately 16,000 and 13,000, respectively, as
from that date on only respondents in months four and eight in the outgoing rotation groups
report a wage.
(Table 4 near here)
Table 4 reports the estimated wage gaps derived by taking the antilogs of the coefficients
in (the second and fourth columns of) Table 3 and deducting one. Separate results are reported
for the economy as a whole as well as the private sector. Results obtained by Hirsch and
Schumacher (2002) are also reported in the final column of the table. A number of facts emerge:
1. On average the wage differential over the period is approximately 18 per cent. This compares
with an average of just over 14 per cent when similar calculations are performed using the first
and third columns of Table 3 which include workers with imputed wages28.
2. The size of the union wage gap or mark-up is the same in the private sector as it is in the
economy as a whole.
3. There appears to be a decline in the size of the differential since 1995, as the US economy
entered a boom period. We later examine this issue in more detail as we find similar results in
the UK.
4. The private sector differentials we report in the second column of Table 4 are smaller than
those obtained by Hirsch and Schumacher (2002) in the third column of the table. Why? It

23

appears the answer is because of the sensitivity of the union coefficient to changes in the
controls. We illustrate this by pooling the MORG files, excluding those with imputed earnings
data, for the six years 1996-2001 for the public and private sectors combined. The union
coefficient changes as follows as controls are added:
CPS MORG: 1996-2001 (n=663,564)
1. No controls except time
2. + age, age2 + male
3. + race (4)
4. + education (15)
5. + usual hours
6. + organisational status (4)
7. + state dummies (50)
8. + industry dummies (50)
9. + 8 1-digit occupation dummies
10. replace 8 occupation dummies with
85 2-digit occupation dummies
11. Hirsch/Schumacher specification
(Age, age2, male, race (4), education (15),
marital status (6), occupation (8), industry (9), region (8))

.203
.202
.191
.183
.201
.169
.145
.157
.185
.199

Only including time as a control (1996=0, 1997=1,…, etc.) produces a coefficient of .321.
Progressively adding controls that are correlated with union status reduces the coefficient to .145
in line 8, which is the specification we use in Tables 3 and 4. In row 11 we report the
specification used by Hirsch and Schumacher (2000), which includes many fewer controls than
used in our preferred specification in line 8. There is a large literature supporting the inclusion
of controls for local labour market characteristics (e.g. Blanchflower and Oswald, 1994) and
industry characteristics (e.g. Blanchflower, Oswald and Sanfey, 1998). Adding occupation
dummies, especially at the two-digit level, appears to raise the size of the differential by
approximately 4 percentage points, confirming the point made by Hirsch and Schumacher
(1998)29. Our view is that it is not appropriate to include occupation controls here as they are
likely nothing more than slices (deciles/percentiles?) of the wage distribution itself. In private

24

correspondence, Barry Hirsch has disagreed with this view and argued that occupation dummies
should be included because they reflect large differences in skill not controlled for by years of
schooling and age. Given that there is a large variation in individual union status within broad
occupation groups, his view is that they may be an appropriate control. There is no simple way
to resolve this issue – it is a substantive point that does influence the level of the differential
although it appears to have little effect on the time-series properties of the differential. We have
simply agreed to disagree on this one and let the reader decide. As ever, the truth probably lies
somewhere in between!
The results reported in Table 4 are broadly comparable to the estimates obtained by H.
Gregg Lewis (1986) in his Table 9.7, which summarised the findings of 165 studies for the
period 1967-79.

Lewis concluded that during this period the US mean wage gap was

approximately 15 per cent. His results are reported below30:

The left panel contains estimates for the six years prior to our starting point in Table 4. It does
appear that the unweighted average for this first period, 1967-72, of 14 per cent is slightly below
that of the second interval, 1973-79. The estimates for the later period are in turn somewhat
smaller than those we obtained in Table 4 – which averaged 20 per cent – but appear to have the
same time-series pattern; for example, 1979 has the lowest value in both sources. In part, the
low number Lewis obtained for 1979 is explained by the fact that the 1979 May CPS file

25

included allocated earners and hence the estimates were not adjusted for the downward bias
caused by the imputation of the earnings data31.
(Table 5 near here)
Table 5 uses the same pooled MORG file as we used above to examine the sensitivity of
the union coefficient to changes in controls for the years 1996-2001, but this time to measure
disaggregated union wage gaps. The first row entry of column 1 presents the union coefficient
of .145 obtained from specification 8 above, which included a full set of controls except
occupation. The coefficient is exponentiated in column 4 giving an overall differential of 15.6
per cent. Reading down that column, estimates for males and females and the public and private
sectors are broadly the same32, and union wage effects are higher for the young and the least
educated, non-whites, part-timers, manual workers, and non-manufacturing. These results are
similar to those found by Lewis (1986), who concluded that the gap was greater for blacks than
whites; in services than in manufacturing; for construction than for other non-manufacturing; for
blue-collar workers than for white-collar; and for private- than for public-sector workers. As do
we, Lewis concluded that the estimates for men and women were approximately the same.
Further, Lewis found that the wage gap fell as years of schooling, establishment or firm size and
industry unemployment rates rose. For age, years of experience and years of seniority the gap at
first fell and then increased. The robustness of Lewis’s results were broadly confirmed by Jarrell
and Stanley (1990) using meta-analysis, although their mean estimate of the wage gap for the
period was a little lower than that obtained by Lewis. There is very little new under the sun!
Columns 2 and 3 of Table 5 report the results of including both a union variable and a
union*time interaction term.

In all cases, the interaction term is negative and significant,

implying for all groups a significant decline in the size of the premium between 1996 and 2001.

26

The penultimate two columns attempt to enumerate the scale of these declines. In the fifth
column headed ‘Wage gap 1996’ the union*time term is set to zero and the union coefficient is
exponentiated (i.e. for row 1 antilog (.167-[.012*0] minus 1=18.2%)). In the next column the
same exercise is performed for the end year of 2001 when time=5. Hence, in this case the
calculation is (i.e. for row 1 antilog (.167-[.012*5] minus 1=11.3%), implying an overall decline
of just under 7 percentage points in the differential between 1996 and 2001. The decline has
been greatest over the period among the most highly educated and in services (see the summary
results in the final column of the table). But all groups have experienced a substantial decline in
the wage premium. In 1996, the premium was above 15% for all but 3 of the 17 worker types.
In 2001, it was below 15% for all but 3 of the worker types.
Is the relatively high differential in the US an artifact of sample selectivity?

In

Blanchflower and Freeman (1992) it was argued that this is not the correct way to interpret the
data and this is still our view. The reasons given, which are still relevant, were as follows:
1. Evidence within the US tends to reject the notion that union wage effects are large when union
density is small.

Union wage differentials tend to be greater, the greater the extent of

unionisation in the sector (see Lewis, 1986; Freeman and Medoff, 1984), presumably because
this gives unions greater bargaining power.
2. If selectivity were the major cause of the estimated large effects of unionism on wages in the
US, similar differences in other labour market outcomes should be expected, which is not the
case.
3. Third, the fact that employers as well as workers affect union density makes the direction of
the selectivity effect uncertain (Farber, 2001). One might well argue that selectivity operates to

27

bias downward union wage effects as employers fight hardest against unions that have the most
potential for raising wages and accept unions when they have the least potential.
4. Massive employer opposition to unions in the US, but not elsewhere, is consistent with the
union demand for higher wages being greater in the US than in other countries.
All of this does not deny the possibility that our estimates may be contaminated by the
reverse effects of density on wage differentials. But any such potential contamination is unlikely
to reverse the finding that union wage differentials are relatively high for similar workers in the
US relative to other countries.
An obvious question to ask is: why has union membership and union employment been in
decline given the relative constancy of the union wage premium in the years up to 1995? The
level of the differential – at around 18 per cent – is still very high by international standards. The
United States decides union membership through an adversarial electoral process at plant level,
which has evolved into a system where management has a greater say in unionisation outcomes
than it does in other countries. The benefit to employers in removing unions from the workplace
often outweighs the costs of doing so. The costs to unions in organising recruitment drives is
high: Farber and Western (2001) estimate that in order to match the rate of union organising
seen in the 1970s unions would have to organise 374,000 private sector employees a year, which
is much more than is currently being achieved (99,000). Their lower-bound estimate of the cost
of doing so is $575.5 million per year, or about $64 per union member33.

Bender (1997) has

further argued that the loss of economies of scale in union organising is an important factor in
explaining union decline. It is much harder for employers in other countries to get rid of unions
than it is in the US. Even in the UK there are only a very few examples of union de-recognition
(Millward, Bryson and Forth, 2000). Employers are unable to hide from a union; they have no

28

place to go. The decline in US unionism seems to have been driven by employer opposition,
fueled by more competitive product markets, increased international trade and a favourable legal
environment, as a result of which there have been smaller economic rents to be shared with
workers than was true in the past34. Linneman, Wachter and Carter (1990, p. 51) have gone
even further and suggested that the evidence of a relatively constant aggregate union wage
premium is a ‘statistical artifact’. High premium industries, they show, have been increasing
their union wage premia and losing employment shares and hence membership of trade unions.
Union wage premia in private services, they argue, have held constant or fallen. They argue that
even though unions have been hurt by exogenous factors, which have created shifts in demand
from goods to service-producing industries, they have been hurt most by the rising wage premia.
Supporting evidence for this view is presented by Freeman (1986), who found a positive
correlation between the union wage gap and a proxy for managerial opposition to unions,
namely, the number of unfair labor practices per worker in NLRB elections. Farber (1990) also
concludes that the decline was principally a result of increased employer opposition to unions
along with lower demand for union services by workers.
The results in this chapter suggest that the union wage differential in the US is
comparatively high, although there is now some, admittedly weak, evidence of countries with
even larger effects (see above). However, it is unclear how much weight should be placed on the
latter estimates, which are based on small sample sizes. The decline in union density in the US
does not appear to be an aberration but is structurally rooted in what unions do on the wage front.
Whereas in the 1950s and 1960s the large differentials that US unions gained were probably
economically justified given the United States’ role as world economic leader, the increased

29

differentials that emerged in the 1970s still appear to be a major liability to the future
development of unionism in the US.
5. Union wage differentials for the United Kingdom
Evidence to date is merely suggestive of a declining union wage premium: there are few studies
estimating the union wage premium with consistent time-series data, and recent studies use
techniques which were not used in earlier analyses35. This gap in the evidence is filled by
analyses of the union wage premium over the period 1985-2001 presented in Table 6. We use
two data sources: the Labour Force Survey (LFS) for the UK, and the British Social Attitudes
Surveys (BSAS). The LFS estimates tend to be above the BSAS estimates, but in both series
there has been a decline in the log hourly union wage premium since 1994 (with the BSAS
estimate for 1997 being an outlier, perhaps due to the much smaller sample that year).36
Although the premium remains roughly 10 per cent in the 2000 LFS, it falls to a statistically
insignificant 5 per cent in BSAS 2000, and falls even further in 2001. Both series are based on
standard specifications for each separate year (detailed in the notes to Table 6). In identifying
the union effect over time, we make what we think is the reasonable assumption that any bias in
our estimates arising through unobserved heterogeneity is constant over time.
(Tables 6 and 7 near here)
Table 7 presents log hourly wage estimates for the United Kingdom based on pooled
years from the LFS37.

It adopts the same format and methodology as the CPS estimates

presented in Table 5. The purpose is to show the variation in the membership premium across
types of worker, and how the downward trend in the premium since the mid-1990s has affected
each group. The fourth column of row 1 shows that, for the period 1993-2000, the hourly union
wage premium across the economy was 9.9 per cent (n=105,112).

This figure is the

30

exponentiated coefficient based on the point estimate of .094 in the first column. This point
estimate for the union coefficient changes as follows as controls are added:

The coefficient falls with the addition of new controls, particularly at stages 2 and then at
stage 5 when workplace size is introduced. However, it rises a little in stages 6 and 7, pointing to
the fact that unobserved heterogeneity can both upwardly and downwardly bias estimates of the
union wage premium. As was found above for the US, the addition of 1- or 2-digit occupation
dummies increases the size of the estimated union effect. However, in contrast to the US, the
size of the union effect does not rise as we move from 1-digit to 2-digit occupation dummies.
Returning to Table 7, the entries in the fourth column show that the union premium is
highest among manual workers, part-timers, and women. These are all groups with traditionally
low earnings. Conversely, the premium is lowest among the traditionally higher paid, namely,
men and the highly educated. In the same way as described for the US data in Table 5, the fifth
and sixth columns of Table 7 use the information generated by a union*time interaction – the
data are reported in columns 2 and 3 – to show the premium in 1993 and 2000 for the whole
economy and for seventeen sub-groups of employees. In the whole sample, the wage gap
dropped from 14.2 per cent in 1993 to 6.3 per cent in 2000. What is remarkable is the evidence
of a large fall in the wage premium across most types of worker, indicated by the sub-group

31

regressions. In 1993 only one group of employees (the highly educated) had a premium well
below 10 per cent. In 2000, all but three out of the 17 types of worker had a premium below 10
per cent. Those worse affected were manufacturing workers, men, private sector workers and
non-whites, all of whom had no significant premium by 2000.
(Table 8 near here)
Table 8 performs a similar task to Table 7, this time presenting differences in the union
wage premium for Britain, but based on pooled years from the BSAS 1985-200138. The first
column shows that, for the period 1985-2001, the hourly union wage premium across the
economy was around 9 per cent. This point estimate for the union coefficient changes as follows
as controls are added:
BSAS files: 1985-2001 (n=17,934)

2.
3.
4.

6.
7.

No controls except categorical time dummies
+ 5 age dummies + female
+ 7 education dummies
+ full-time status + manual
+ 6 workplace size dummies
+ 6 region dummies
+ manufacturing dummy

.196
.149
.108
.111
.068
.082
.087

The coefficient falls with the addition of new controls from stages 1 to 3, rises a little
when full-time and manual status are controlled for, then falls substantially with the workplace
size dummies, as happened with LFS. Again, as with the LFS, the coefficient rises with region
and industry dummies. The sub-group analysis in the first column of Table 8 shows that, over
the whole period, the wage premium was highest among manual workers, part-timers, those with
low or no qualifications and women, again reflecting the LFS findings.
The simplest way to show the impact of the declining union premium across types of
worker in BSAS is to estimate the premium for each group before the decline occurred (1993-

32

95), and then again at the end of the period (1999-2001). These estimates are presented in the
last two columns of Table 8. In 1993-95, only two types of worker (non-manuals and the highly
qualified) had a union premium of less than 10 per cent. By 1999-2001, eleven types of worker
had a premium of less than 10 per cent. For five types of worker (men, younger workers, those
in the private sector, non-manuals, and the highly educated) the membership premium was no
longer statistically significant.
Across the economy as a whole, the membership premium fell from 12.2 per cent in
1993-95 to 5.1 per cent in 1999-2001. What is interesting is the way that the premium collapses
for some workers. For instance, there has always been a ranking in the premium according to
educational attainment, with membership raising the wages of the least qualified most. This is
apparent in the second column for the period 1993-95. But what is striking is that, by 19992001, the premium for the highly qualified is flattened. Similarly, full-timers saw their premium
plummet to a barely statistically significant (t=1.97) 3.3 per cent, while the premium held up well
for part-timers. The premium has also held up well in the public sector, among older workers,
and among manual workers, but it has all but collapsed in the private sector, among younger
workers, and among non-manuals.
The case of male workers is unique. The table shows that, whereas the premium was
similar for men and women in the mid-1990s, it was considerably lower for men than for women
by the end of the period. However, the picture changes on introducing a public sector control.
As note c to the table points out, the public sector dummy was omitted from the results presented
because it was not available for the 1994 and 1995 surveys. However, we reran all estimates
including the public sector dummy for years where the public sector dummy was available to
check the sensitivity of our results. Calculating the premia for men and women for 1993 only

33

produces results similar to the 1993-95 pooled estimates but, with the public sector added to the
pooled 1999-2001 analysis the male union premium is estimated to be 6.3 per cent, while that for
women is 5.7 per cent. Thus, once the public sector control is included, men’s and women’s
membership premium is not significantly different in the later period. This is because the public
sector dummy is negative and significant in the case of men, but non-significant in the case of
women.

The explanation is straightforward.

Because public sector employment and

unionisation are highly correlated, in the absence of a public sector control the union
membership dummy is picking up the negative wage differential of public sector workers among
men. For women, the addition of the public sector control makes no difference because there is
no negative public sector wage differential among women.

6. The cyclical nature of the wage gap in the United States and the United Kingdom
Figure 1a plots the point estimates of the union wage premium for the US, taken from the
first column of Table 4, against unemployment for 1973-2000. Figure 1b does the same for
Britain for 1985-2001, using the data from the last column in Table 6. In both countries the
premium is counter-cyclical. Regressions were then run for each of the countries with the union
premium as the dependent variable – using the data from Table 4 for the US and Table 6 for the
UK (when there were observations in a single year from both the LFS and the BSAS, the average
of the two was used) for the years 1973-2001. Each equation included a highly significant, and
positive, US dummy. The one year lag on the unemployment rate was significantly positive (tstatistics are in parentheses) whether a lagged dependent variable was excluded (equation 5) or
included (equation 6). The level of unemployment was never significant and is excluded in the

34

equations below. The time trend is also not significant. When the time trend was replaced by the
union density rate that was also insignificant and the other results were the same:
Premiumt = 6.026 + .700 Unemploymentt-1 - .055time + 8.387US
(2.54) (3.10)
(1.04)
(9.22)
(N=42, R2=.769)

(5)

Premiumt = 5.452 + .248Premiumt-1 + .511 Unemploymentt-1 - .079time + 6.108US
(2.40) (2.24)
(2.21)
(1.53)
(4.57)
(N=42, R2=.797)

(6)

These regressions support the notion that the union wage premium is counter-cyclical,
moving positively with changes in the (lagged) unemployment rate. Thus, as unemployment
falls, as it has done since 1995, the union wage premium falls; and as unemployment rises the
wage premium rises. As the economy moves into boom the differential falls, and as it moves
into recession the premium rises: unions are better for workers in slumps than they are in booms.
Further, the insignificance of the time trend implies the premium is untrended. So, contrary to
what some commentators, particularly British ones, have been suggesting, it seems the recent
decline in the union wage premium is not necessarily a secular decline, but a decline induced by
favourable labour market conditions. What this suggests is that, when demand for labour is
strong, employees are less reliant on unions to bargain for better wages because market wages
rise anyway. However, when market conditions are less favourable to workers, the premium
rises because union bargaining cushions members from market fluctuations. So, although there
are indications that the benefits of membership – as measured by the wage premium – have
declined since the mid-1990s, this may be a cyclical phenomenon. The premium may rise again
in the face of deteriorating economic conditions currently being experienced at the time of
writing (October 2002). Furthermore, although it is possible that a decline in the net benefits of
membership has induced a decline in union density, trends in the wage premium can only help

35

explain falling density since the mid-1990s, since the premium was fairly stable before that
point. In the years up to 1995 this could be a batting average effect. As union density declines,
the more powerful unions are the ones that remain. The weaker batsmen are removed from the
batting order so the team's average rises. Another possibility, of course, is that a high union/nonunion wage differential provides an incentive for employers to try and reduce union power. The
fact that the differential remained more or less constant in both the UK and the US for so long is
a puzzle, particularly given the rapid declines in union membership in both countries. The
evidence is not consistent with the widely held view that union power has been emasculated.
7. Conclusions
This paper has attempted to address the question: ‘what do unions do on the wage front?’ The
answer in the cases of both the US and the UK is that, despite declining membership numbers,
unions are able to raise wages substantially over the equivalent non-union wage. Unions in other
countries, such as Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, Denmark, Japan, New
Zealand, Norway, Portugal and Spain, are also able to raise wages by significant amounts. In
countries where union wage settlements frequently spill over into the non-union sector (e.g.
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden) there is, as one might expect, no
significant union wage differential. The estimates from the seventeen countries we examined
averages out at 12 per cent.
Time series evidence from both the US and the UK suggests three interesting findings.
First, the union differential in the US is higher on average than that found in the UK (18 per cent
compared with 10 per cent). Second, the union wage premium in both countries was untrended
in the years up to the mid-1990s. Third, in both countries the wage premium has fallen in the
boom years since 1994/95. It is too early to tell whether the onset of a downturn in 2002 will

36

cause the differential to rise again or whether there is a trend change in the impact of unions. It
is our view that most likely what has happened is that the tightening of the labour market has
resulted in a temporary decline in the size of the union wage premium. Time will tell whether
the current loosening of the labour market, that is occurring in both countries, will return the
union wage premium to its long run values of 10 per cent in the case of the UK and 18 per cent
in the case of the US.

On the basis of past experience it seems likely that they will.

Notes and Sources: Dependent variable is the log hourly wage.
a) 1973-1981 May CPS, n=38,000 for all sectors, and n=31,000 for the private sector. Controls comprise age, age2,
male, union, years of education, 2 race dummies, 28 state dummies, usual hours, private sector and 50 industry
dummies. For 1980 and 1981 sample sizes fall to approx. 16,000 because from 1980 only respondents in months 4
and 8 in the outgoing rotation groups report a wage. Since the May CPS sample files available to us do not include
allocated earnings in 1973-81, the series in columns 2 and 4 are adjusted upward by the average bias of 0.033 found
by Hirsch and Schumacher (2002) using these May CPS data for 1979-81.
b) Matched Outgoing Rotation Group files of the Current Population Survey (MORGs), 1983-2001. Controls
comprise usual hours, age, age2, 4 race dummies, 15 highest qualifications dummies, male, union, 46 industry
dummies, 4 organisational status dummies, and 50 state dummies. Sample is non-agricultural workers working at
the time of interview, aged at least 16 years. For 1989-95 allocation flags are either unreliable (in 1989-93) or not
available (1994 through August 1995). For 1989-93, the gaps are adjusted upward by the average imputation bias
during 1983-88 (.031 in column 3). For 1994-95 the gap is adjusted upward by the bias during 1996-98 (.046 in
column 3).

Notes: Wage gap estimates calculated taking anti-logs and deducting 1. Columns 1 and 2 are taken from Table 3.
Column 3 is taken from column 5 of Table 4 of Hirsch and Schumacher (2002).
Source: Data for 1973-81 are from the May CPS Earnings Supplements, and for 1983-2001 from the monthly CPSORG earnings files. The Hirsch and Schumacher (2002) sample includes employed private sector nonagricultural
wage and salary workers aged 16 years and above with positive weekly earnings and non-missing data for control
variables (few observations are lost). The wage gap reported in column 3 is the coefficient on a dummy variable for
union membership in a regression where the log of hourly earnings is the dependent variable. The control variables
included are years of schooling, experience and its square (allowed to vary by gender), and dummy variables for
gender, race and ethnicity (3), marital status (2), part-time status, region (8), large metropolitan area, industry (8),
and occupation (12). Because the sample does not include allocated earnings in 1973-78, the “not corrected” series
are adjusted downwards by the average bias found during 1979-81 of .033 in column 3. All three columns include
only workers reporting earnings. All allocated earners are identified and excluded for the years 1973-88 and 19962001. For 1989-95 allocation flags are either unreliable (in 1989-93) or not available (1994 through August 1995).

51

For 1989-93, the gaps are adjusted upward by the average imputation bias during 1983-88 (.031 in column 3). For
1994-95 the gap is adjusted upward by the bias during 1996-98 (.046 in column 3).

Sources: Data in the first column are from the UK Labour Force Surveys. The controls comprise industry dummies,
region dummies, age, age squared, highest qualification dummies, workplace size dummies, usual hours, race
dummies, and a gender dummy. Data in the second column are from the British Social Attitudes Surveys. Controls
are gender, age, ethnicity, qualifications, manual worker, full-time worker, establishment size, public sector,
manufacturing, and region. The BSAS estimates for 1994 and 1995 exclude the public sector dummy because this
was not available in that year, while the 1991 estimates exclude the ethnic minority dummy due to the low number
of valid cases with ethnicity in that year. In both series, the dependent variable is the log of the hourly wage. In the
BSAS this is derived from the annual banded earnings data by taking the mid-point of the respondent’s earnings
band and dividing this by continuous hours worked. (The earnings band for the top-coded highest earners is closed
by introducing an upper ceiling which is 1.5 times the lower band.) Before 1996, the BSAS hours worked question
did not explicitly mention overtime hours. The hours denominator used here explicitly includes overtime hours from
1996 onwards. No BSAS surveys were conducted in 1988 and 1992. Numbers of observations are given in
parentheses.

Notes:
a. Coefficients are exponentiated, depicting the difference in log gross hourly wages between members and nonmembers, expressed as a percentage of non-members’ wages. Figures in parentheses are the number of
observations in the model.
b. The figures are derived from the union membership dummy coefficient in pooled regressions for the years
stated. Specification M(1) pools the data for 1985-2001 and (where the sub-groups do not preclude their
inclusion) they contain the following controls: grouped years, gender, age, qualifications, manual worker, fulltime worker, establishment size, manufacturing, region, grouped year dummies. M(2) is the same as M(1), but
excluding the grouped year variables, for the period 1993-95; M(3) performs the same calculation for the most
recent period, 1999-2001.
c. Surveys in 1994 and 1995 did not collect information on sector, so M(2) for public and private sector equations
is run for the 1993 data only. We tested the sensitivity of results to the inclusion of a public sector dummy in
models. Where significant, these are reported in the text.
d. All estimates are based on unweighted data.
e. The dependent variable is the log of the hourly wage. Using the mid-point methodology, this is derived from the
annual banded earnings data by taking the mid-point of the respondent’s earnings band and dividing this by
continuous hours worked. (The earnings band for the top-coded highest earners is closed by introducing an
upper ceiling which is 1.5 times the lower band.) Before 1996 the BSAS hours worked question did not
explicitly mention overtime hours. The hours denominator used here explicitly includes overtime hours from
1996 onwards.
f. No surveys were conducted in 1988 and 1992.

Endnotes
1

Some of the estimates are for Great Britain which, unlike the UK, excludes Northern Ireland.
Estimates are similar whichever geographical area is chosen.

We have no micro-data since 2001 when labour markets loosened and the unemployment rate
started to rise again in the United States.
3

Wessels (1994) has cogently argued that OLS will not necessarily provide an upper limit
estimate. His argument is that, provided a union has a certain degree of bargaining power,
union-won increases in the wage that lead the firm to hire more able workers will be followed by
further union actions to raise the wage. Knowing this and given repeated bargains, the firm will
not necessarily hire more able workers.
4

Kaufman (2002) discusses the extent to which this empirical work on union wage
determination fits the various economic models of union wage determination that have been
developed since the work of Dunlop and Ross. His conclusion is pessimistic.

Unfortunately the BHPS data file is very small in size with only around 4,000 workers present
in consecutive waves and hence there are very few individuals that change status from year to
year. This means there are severe limitations to using BHPS to compare the sensitivity of union
wage gap estimates to differences in methodology as in Andrews et al. (1998).

Freeman (1995) and Mishel and Bernstein (1994) report declines of this magnitude.

For more information on changes in real wages, see OECD (1996) and Katz, Loveman, and
Blanchflower (1995) for the UK, the US, France and Japan.

65

12

See OECD (1996).

13

Interestingly enough, Canada with many of the same firms and trade unions as the US has not
seen declines in density: 1970=31%, 1980=36.1%; 1990=35.8%; 1993=37.4% (see Visser,
1996).
14

We thank Mark Wooden for providing us with these numbers.

15

Further examples of studies for Canada are Simpson (1985), who found 11% for 1974; Grant,
Swidinsky, and Vanderkamp (1987) who reported 12-14% for 1969 and 13-16% for 1970.
16

Australian studies include Kornfeld (1993), who found 7-10% for young people between 1984
and 1987; Mulvey (1986), who obtained estimates of 7% for women and 10% for men using a
1982 sample; Christie (1992) who obtained an estimate of 16.6% using OLS and 17.2% using
simultaneous equation methods with 1984 data; and Blanchflower and Freeman (1992) who
report 8% for the period 1985-87.
17

In footnote 36 below we make use of individual level data from a similar survey undertaken in
the UK, namely, the 1998 Workplace Employee Relations Survey.
18

In Blanchflower (1996) union wage gap estimates were obtained based on similar data and
specifications for the following countries (where * indicates not significantly different from
zero):
%
Australia
9.2
Austria
14.6
Canada
4.8*
Germany
3.4
Ireland
30.5
Israel
7.0*
Italy
7.2
Japan
47.8
Netherlands
3.7*
New Zealand 8.4
Norway
7.7
Spain
0.3*
Switzerland
0.8*
The very large estimate for Japan appears to arise because of the lack of controls for
workplace/firm size. Some of the estimates are based on only a few hundred observations and so
care has to be taken in interpreting these results.

Troy (2000) has argued that union density in Canada has remained as high as it has due to the
expanded role of the public sector and quasi-public sector organizations (particularly in health
care). Troy shows that private sector density – in contrast to that in the public sector – has
declined albeit at a somewhat slower rate than in the US.
21

The May extracts of the CPS extracts in Stata format from 1969-1987 are available from the
NBER at http://www.nber.org/data/cps_may.html
22

Hirsch, Macpherson, and Schumacher (2002) have compared union wage gap estimates
obtained from the BLS quarterly Employment Cost Index (ECI) constructed from establishment
surveys and from the annual Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC) with those
obtained using the CPS. They find that union/non-union wage trends in the three series ‘are
consistent neither with each other nor with the CPS’, and ultimately conclude that ‘we find
ourselves relying most heavily on results drawn from the CPS’ (Hirsch, Macpherson, and
Schumacher, 2002, p.23).
23

There was no CPS survey with wages and union status in 1982.

24

Following Mincer, it is more usual to include a term in potential experience rather than a
direct measure of age. We use education, however, for reasons of comparability as the CPS
Outgoing Rotation Group files from 1993 report qualifications rather than years of schooling.
25

We do not deal here with a further problem identified by Card (1996) of misclassification of
self-reported union status in the CPS, first identified by Mellow and Sider (1983). Card
concludes that about 2.7% are false positives and 2.7% are false negatives. Given that there are
more non-union workers than union workers, this means the union density rate is biased
upwards. See Farber (2001) for a discussion and a procedure to adjust the union density rate for
error. In 1998, the observed private sector rate of 9.7% translates to an adjusted rate of 7.4% (the
figures for 1973 were 25.9% and 24.5% respectively).
26

The number of wage observations followed by the percentage imputed in parentheses (hourly
+ non-hourly paid) in the NBER MORG are given below. Note in 1995 allocation information is
only available on one-third of wage observations, hence the small sample.

Bratsberg and Ragan (2002) found an average premium in the private sector of 16.8%, 197199, using a set of control variables similar to those used by Hirsch and Schumacher (2002).

There was essentially no difference in the results when two-digit occupation dummies were
replaced with three- digit dummies (results not reported).
30

There is a dissonance between the estimates Lewis offers by way of summary in his
introductory chapter and those given in his Table 9.7 which are produced here (Lewis, 1986, p.
9)
31

Lewis (1986) had 35 studies using the CPS, 1970-1979; 16 studies using the 1967 Survey of
Economic Opportunity; 25 studies using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, 1967-78; 15
studies using Michigan Survey Research Center survey data other than the PSID, including the
1972-73 Quality of Employment Survey; 22 studies using the National Longitudinal Surveys of
1969-72; and 8 studies exploiting other sources.
32

Full equations for the US as a whole as well as disaggregations by gender and broad sector are
reported in Appendix Table 3.
33

Even activism on this scale would yield a steady state private sector unionisation rate of just
6.4% (Farber and Western, 2001, p. 27).
34

For further discussion on this point, see Blanchflower and Freeman (1992).

35

Blanchflower (1999) estimated union wage premia for the UK using the same methods as
used here for the period 1983-94 using data from the same sources as used here plus the British
Household Panel Survey for 1991-93 and the 1983 General Household Survey and found
evidence of a constancy of the differential at approximately 10%.
36

Further support for the proposition that the BSAS 1997 point estimate is an outlier comes from
the authors’ calculations of the log hourly wage premium using the same methodology
(unweighted estimates of the mid-point earnings) for individual level data from the Workplace
Employee Relations Survey 1998, the fieldwork for which spanned 1997 and 1998. The raw
membership premium is .226 (25.4%). This shifts with the addition of controls as follows: +
demographics = .121; + job = .114; + establishment = .076; + geographical = .091. In short,
these estimates also point to a premium of around 10% in 1997/98.
