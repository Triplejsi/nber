ABSTRACT

We provide new measures of ethnic, linguistic and religious fractionalization for about 190
countries. These measures are more comprehensive than those previously used in the economics
literature and we compare our new variables with those previously used. We also revisit the question
of the effects of ethnic, linguistic and religious fractionalization on quality of institutions and
growth. We partly confirm and partly modify previous results. The patterns of cross-correlations
between potential explanatory variables and their different degree of endogeneity makes it hard to
make unqualified statements about competing explanations for economic growth and the quality of
government.

Introduction

Ethnic conflict is an important determinant of the political economy of many
nations and localities. Many believe that it leads to political instability, poor
quality of institutions, badly designed of economic policy and disappointing
economic performance.
In a cross-country setting, Easterly and Levine (1997) have shown that
per capita GDP growth is inversely related to ethnolinguistic fractionalization in a large sample of countries. In particular, they argued that much of
Africa’s growth failure is due to ethnic conflict, partly as a result of absurd
borders left by former colonizers.1 As a result of that paper, a measure
of ethnic fractionalization has become a “standard” control in regressions
explaining cross-national diﬀerences in economic success.2
A related literature, early examples being Canning and Fay (1993) and
Mauro (1995), has discussed the impact of ethnic fragmentation on government activities and quality of institutions. La Porta et al. (1999), in a broad
empirical study of the determinants of the quality of government, suggest
that ethnic fractionalization matters, even though variables related to legal
origins may be more important. A large literature on US localities show that
in more ethnically fragmented communities, public goods provision is less
eﬃcient, participation in social activities and trust is lower, and economic
success, measured by growth of city size, is inferior.3 Evidence that trust
does not travel well across racial lines is also supported by experimental
evidence.4
Another related literature, Esteban and Ray (1994) on the theoretical
side and Garcia-Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2002) on the empirical side,
discuss which are the best measures of heterogeneity. The traditional measure of ethnic fractionalization is given by the probability that two randomly

ethnic diversity on civil wars, suggesting that fractionalization does not help predict the
incidence of domestic violent conflict once poverty and income levels are controlled for
(see Fearon and Lattin (2000)).

drawn individuals from the population belong to two diﬀerent groups. Its
theoretical maximum is reached (at the value of 1) when each person belongs to a diﬀerent group. In contrast, simple measures of polarization reach
their maximum when two equally sized groups face each other. We use both
measures of fractionalization and of polarization in our empirical work, and
discuss how results diﬀer across the two sets of indices.
While existing measure of racial (or ethnic) fragmentation for the US
are reasonably well-accepted, since they are based upon detailed and reliable census data, cross-country measures have been widely debated. Easterly
and Levine (1997) use indices based on ethnolinguistic classification provided
by sources from the former Soviet Union, the Atlas Narodov Mira of 1964.
These data rely largely on linguistic distinctions, which may obscure other
aspect of ethnicity like racial origin, skin color, etc. Interestingly, studies
within the United States do not look at language in the racial classification.
If they did, blacks and whites would be classified in the same group. As
we discuss below, this example shows that although useful, language is not
the only way to look at ethnicity.5 In Latin America several countries are
relatively homogeneous in terms of language spoken, often the one of former colonizers, but much less so if skin color or racial origin is taken into
account. The World Bank estimates that the percentage of Afro-Latinos in
Latin America is higher than the percentage of African-Americans in the
United States. Peoples of indigenous or mestizo background also form a
large percentage of the population in most Latin American countries.
Another diﬃculty in measuring heterogeneity is that ethnic classifications are not set in stone, and are more complex than can be summarized
by simple measures. For example, the Oromo in Ethiopia are split into five
diﬀerent groups as a result of regional migrations and intermixing with other
groups, suggesting that fractionalization evolves endogenously as a function
of migration and intergroup mixing. The infamous Hutu-Tutsi divide in
Burundi was thought by some to have been greatly accentuated (some even
say created) by the Belgian colonizers, suggesting that fractionalization may
also be endogenous because the definition of groups can shift over time. People of African origin do not have as clear a dividing line from the rest of
the population in many Latin American countries as they do in the US,
suggesting that ethnic diﬀerences may not be suﬃcient to fully characterize
the degree of heterogeneity. Hence, ethnic classifications are fraught with
5

Racial classification follows the census which divides American in five groups: White,
Blacks, America Indians, Pacific islanders, and Hispanics. As for ethnicity country of
origin like Ireland, Italy, Japan etc. is also available.

2

ambiguities, as we discuss in depth below. Having mentioned this important
caveat, our measures of ethnic, linguistic and religious heterogeneity capture
distinctions that may still matter enormously for economic outcomes.
This paper seeks to achieve four goals. Firstly, we provide a new measure
of ethnic fragmentation based on a boarder classification of groups, taking
into account not only language but also other cleavages such as racial characteristics. We provide this measure for many more countries (almost twice
as many) than those normally used in the literature, using diﬀerent sources,
and we discuss in detail similarities and diﬀerences between our measure
and previous ones. We construct three new indices, one based on a broad
measure of ethnicity, one based strictly on language and one based on religion.
Secondly, we show that indices of fractionalization constructed using
measures of ethnicity, language or religion lead to substantially diﬀerent results when they are entered in regressions to explain growth and government
quality.
Thirdly, using our new measures we reexamine the evidence on the eﬀects
of ethnic fragmentation on two general areas: economic growth and the
quality of institutions and policy. We reach interesting results:
a) On economic growth, we broadly confirm the results by Easterly and
Levine (1997). In fact the negative eﬀect of ethnic fragmentation on growth
is reinforced with the new data, and we are able to highlight the diﬀerences
between ethnic, linguistic and religious fractionalization.
b) On quality of government and policies we make some progress over La
Porta et al. (1999). They argued that both legal origin, distance from the
equator and ethnolinguistic fractionalization explain the quality of government. In their results, legal origin variables tend to be stronger than ethnolinguistic fractionalization. We argue that results on this point are sensitive
to the specification, and one can easily produce reasonable specifications in
which ethnic fragmentation “dominates” legal origin. We do not intend to
argue that ethnic fractionalization “beats” legal origin, but more modestly
that the pattern of correlation between independent variables makes it very
hard to resolve this horse race. Most likely both set of variables are important, and we discuss carefully the patterns of cross-correlation between these
variables and the potential channels linking fractionalization to government
quality.
c) Ethnic fractionalization is also closely correlated with GDP per capita
and geographic variables, like latitude. More ethnic fragmentation is more
3

common in poorer countries which are closer to the equator. This complicate even more the task of apportioning precisely the weight of ethnic
fragmentation to policy variables, the quality of government and growth.
Thus the pattern of cross-correlations between explanatory variables cannot
be ignored when drawing conclusions on these issues. As is well known,
in many cases the results of cross-country regressions are sensitive to the
econometric specification, and this case is no exception. Useful lessons can
be learned from this sensitivity, however, as it may inform us as to the
channels whereby fractionalization operated to depress growth or reduce
the quality of government.
d) While ethnic and linguistic fractionalization are associated with negative outcomes in terms of quality of government, religious fractionalization
is not; in fact, if anything, this measure displays a positive correlation with
measures of good governance. This is because measured religious fractionalization tends to be higher in more tolerant and free societies, like the United
States, which in fact displays one the of the highest level of religious fractionalization. This result has no bearing, however, on the question of whether
certain religious denominations are correlated with better politico-economic
outcomes, an issue recently explored by Barro and McLeary (2002).
Finally we explore which indicator of fractionalization is more correlated
with variables of interest. We conclude that the measure of fractionalization,
traditionally used in the literature perform a bit better than the measure of
polarization proposed by Garcia-Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2002).
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present our new
data and new indices of ethnic fractionalization and polarization. In Section
3, we present evidence on the relationship between fractionalization and
growth in a broad cross-section of countries. In Section 4, we examine
how fractionalization relates to the quality of government and institutions.
Section 5 summarizes our results using measures of polarization. Section
6 discusses the impact of ethnic fractionalization on economic variables in
individual countries. The last section concludes.

2.1

New Measures of Fractionalization6
Data sources and measurement issues

Our main goal in gathering data on fractionalization to clearly distinguish
between ethnic, religious and linguistic heterogeneity. Ethnic and linguistic
diﬀerences were previously lumped together as part of an “ethnolinguistic”
fractionalization variable. The data most frequently used in the literature
was compiled in the Soviet Union in the early 1960s on the basis of primary country sources, and published in the Atlas Narodov Mira in 1964.
The ethnolinguistic fractionalization variable (often referred to as ELF) was
computed as one minus the Herfindahl index of ethnolinguistic group shares,
and reflected the probability that two randomly selected individuals from a
population belonged to diﬀerent groups.7 We use the same formula, applied
to diﬀerent underlying data, to compute our measures of fractionalization:
F RACTj = 1 −

N
X
s2ij

(1)

i=1

where sij is the share of group i (i = 1...N ) in country j.
A major obstacle to distinguishing between ethnic and linguistic variables is that language is part of the criterion used by ethnologists and anthropologists to define the concept of ethnicity. This is true, for example,
in Africa, where racial or physical criteria are seldom used to define ethnic
groups. This is not the case, however, in Latin America, where characteristics typically used to distinguish between ethnic groups are racial in nature.
To our knowledge, no measures of racial fragmentation exist for a broad
cross-section of countries, largely because the underlying data on group size
is missing for most countries. Moreover, the gathering of such data would be
fraught with conceptual problems, such as the definition of the physiological
characteristics that distinguish races.
One feasible improvement over existing measures, however, is to compile
a separate variable for linguistic fractionalization in isolation of any racial
of physical characteristics. Our variable “language”, is based exclusively on
data from Encyclopedia Britannica, 2001, which reports the shares of languages spoken as “mother tongues”, generally based on national census data.
6
See http://www.stanford.edu/~wacziarg/papersum.html for our new dataset and related documentation.
7
For the purpose of cross-country regressions, ELF was used, among many others, in
Mauro (1995), Canning and Fay (1993) and Easterly and Levine (1997).

5

Other possible sources for language data include the CIA World Factbook
(which, however, only lists the shares of each language for a few countries)
and the Ethnologue project, which lists approximately 6,800 languages.8
Fractionalization measures constructed from these sources are closely related, as they are based on very similar country source data.9 Our data
includes 1055 major linguistic groups for 201 countries or dependencies.
We also compute a separate variable for religious fractionalization (“religion”), based on data from the Encyclopedia Britannica, 2001. The distinctions in this data are perhaps less controversial and subject to arbitrary
definitions than the data on linguistic and ethnic fractionalization, since
the boundaries of religions are more clear and definitions consistent across
countries. Our data cover 294 diﬀerent religions in 215 countries and dependencies.
Finally, the main variable we focus on is a measure of ethnic fractionalization, “ethnicity”. As suggested above, the definition of ethnicity involves a
combination of racial and linguistic characteristics. For example, our data on
Bolivia involves the following groups: Blancos (10.13%) , Aymara (30.38%),
Quechua (30.38%), Mestizos (25.32%) and others groups (indigenous and
Afro, 3.80%). This, like the data for most of the rest of Latin America and
the Caribbean, is based on racial distinctions rather than linguistic distinctions. In fact, our language data for Bolivia looks very diﬀerent: Aymara
3.24%, Guarani 0.12%, Quechua 8.15%, Spanish 87.65%, Other 0.84%.
In contrast, the ethnicity data for some European countries such as Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland largely reflects languages (for example, the “ethnicity” we have identified in Switzerland include: German 65%,
French 18%, Italian 10%, other Swiss 6% and Romansch 1%). The same
holds for much of Sub-Saharan Africa. These classifications reflect the judgment of ethnologists and anthropologists on the appropriate definition of
ethnicity, which to our knowledge remains a rather vague and amorphous
concept. It would be wrong to interpret our ethnicity variable as reflecting racial characteristics alone, but it does reflect these characteristics to a
greater extent than our language variable, and it should thus be expected
to bear a diﬀerent relationship to economic variables.
An important goal of our collection of ethnicity data was to obtain data
8

http://www.ethnologue.com/
However, the Ethnologue data is much more disaggregated than the Encyclopedia
Britannica data that we use, as relatively similar dialects are classified there as diﬀerent
languages.
9

6

on various ethnic groups that was as disaggregated as we could find. This
required the use of multiple sources of data, which we painstakingly checked
against each other for consistency. The primary source was the Encyclopedia
Britannica (2001), which was the source of our data in 124 of 190 countries.
This was completed with data from the CIA (2000) for 25 countries, Levinson
(1998) for 23 cases and Minority Rights Group International (1997) for 13
cases. For France, Israel, the United States and New Zealand, we directly
consulted the national censuses of these countries to come up with ethnicity
data as disaggregated as available. The rule we followed for data collection
was as follows: if two or more sources for the index of ethnic fractionalization
were identical to the third decimal point, we used these sources (this was
generally recorded as data sourced from the Encyclopedia Britannica). If
sources diverged in such a way that the index of fractionalization diﬀered to
the second decimal point, we used the source where reported ethnic groups
covered the greatest share of the total population. If this was 100% in more
than one sources, we used the source with the most disaggregated data (i.e.
the greatest number of reported ethnic groups). In the end, our ethnicity
variable covers approximately 650 distinct ethnic groups in 190 countries.
One last issue to contend with is that of changes in the ethnic fractionalization index through time, which also raises the issue of its endogeneity.
This is important because our data is from recent sources (generally the
early to mid-1990s). If there were major shifts in ethnic composition, using
data from the end of our period to explain variables for the 1960-1995 period
could lead to endogeneity bias.
Shifts in ethnic composition could stem from changes in the shares of each
group or from changes in the definition of the various ethnic groups. Ethnic
fractionalization indices are generally taken as exogenous in cross-country
regressions, based on the fact that group shares are suﬃciently stable that
changes only have a minor impact on fractionalization measures. This seems
a reasonable assumption at the 30 year horizon of the typical cross-country
regression, even though this assumption may be less tenable for a much
longer horizon. Think for instance of diﬀerent fertility rates across ethnic
groups.
Another problem could occur if the definitions of ethnic groups changed
through time, as a function of economic or political variables. The possibility of such changes in definitions has been pointed out by the “reflexive”
school in ethnology and sociology. According to the reflexive theory of ethnicity and nationality, the boundaries of ethnic groups are changing because

7

individual’s self-identification to groups can change as a result of social, economic or political forces, and ethnicity is therefore endogenous, especially at
long horizons.10 One recent example of this phenomenon is Somalia: prior
to the 1991 civil war, this country appeared relatively homogeneous (85%
Somalis), but during and after the civil war “clans” became the dominant
dimension of ethnic cleavage. In other words, a political event led to the creation of a new dimension of ethnic cleavage, and self-identification to groups
now reflect preexisting clans rather than the Somali “ethnicity”.11
In general, it does not matter for our purposes whether ethnic diﬀerences reflect physical attributes of groups (skin color, facial features) or
long-lasting social conventions (language, marriage within the group, cultural norms) or simple social definition (self-identification, identification by
outsiders). When people persistently identify with a particular group, they
form potential interest groups that can be manipulated by political leaders,
who often choose to mobilize some coalition of ethnic groups (“us”) to the
exclusion of others (“them”). Politicians can also mobilize support by singling out some groups for persecution, where hatred of the minority group
is complementary to some policy the politician wishes to pursue (Glaeser
(2002)).
The bottom line is that while we recognize that ethnic fractionalization
could to some extent be endogenous, and that the previous literature has
probably underplayed this point, we do not believe this is a very serious
problem at the horizon of 20 to 30 years which characterizes our crosscountry work. While the example of Somalia is interesting, in our sample
period such examples are rare and ethnic fractionalization displays tremendous time persistence. More serious is the problem of endogeneity of the
religious fragmentation variable. Repressive regimes, especially those with
a religious bend, may make it diﬃcult for individuals to be “counted” as
members of the non oﬃcially sanctioned religion. This phenomenon could
introduce a spurious correlation between (lack of) political freedom and religious fragmentation.
10

See Hammersley and Atkinson (1995) for a survey of these concepts. The reflexive
school of thought, which seems to be associated with the postmodern tradition in sociology,
is generally contrasted with the “primordialist” school, identified for example with Cliﬀord
Geetz (1973), which seems to be associated with evolutionist theories.
11
Mozzafar and Scarrit (1999) report data on ethnicity at three distinct levels of “selfreference” for Africa. We use their clan data for Somalia, since the rest of their dataset is
suﬃciently close to our other sources.

2.2

Comparison with existing measures

We now compare our measures of linguistic, ethnic and religious fractionalization with the index of ethnolinguistic fractionalization based on the
Soviet data usually used in the literature. Firstly, our indices are available
for many more countries, between 190 and 215 compared to 112 for the
Soviet index. Table 2 shows the pairwise correlations between these four
indices, computed, obviously, on the intersection of our sample and the Soviet sample. The Soviet sample is, with very few exceptions, a subsample of
our own. Not surprisingly, the correlation between our ethnic and linguistic index and the Soviet index are fairly high (0.76 and 0.88, respectively).
Instead, the religious fractionalization index bears a much lower correlation
with the other three indices.
Our data gathering eﬀort can also be related to recent attempts by other
scholars to gather cross-country ethnic heterogeneity data. Annett (2001)
presents an index of ethnolinguistic fractionalization closely related conceptually to the Soviet data, using exclusively data published in the World
Christian Encyclopedia (Barrett, 1982), a source distinct from our own. He
also presents data on religious fractionalization, but does not attempt to
isolate linguistic fractionalization like we do. His data cover 150 countries
(compared to 190 for our ethnicity variable and 215 for our religion variable). Perhaps reassuringly given the diﬀerent sources, for the overlapping
sample of countries the correlation between his ethnolinguistic fractionalization variable and ours ethnicity variable is 88.85% The correlation between
his religious fractionalization variable and our own is 83.66%.
Even more recently, Fearon (2002) has gathered detailed data on ethnic groups for 160 countries, from sources that sometimes overlap with ours
(he does not present data for religious and linguistic fractionalization). His
data is slighly less disaggregated than ours (each country displays on average 5.11 groups in his dataset, versus 5.55 in ours), partly because he
restricts attention to groups making up more than 1% of the population.
These small diﬀerences do not greatly impact our respective measures of
fractionalization: as Fearon reports (2002, p. 3), referring to our dataset,
“the descriptive statistics for their ethnic measure look broadly similar to
those for the measure constructed here”.
Table 3 highlights diﬀerences across regions amongst our three indices
and ELF. With the exception of East and South East Asia, our ethnic fractionalization index show more fractionalization than the Soviet index. Given
the way it is constructed, this is not surprising. Particularly interesting is
9

the case of Latin America, were our ethnic fractionalization index is on average much higher than ELF. This is because, in this region, many ethnically
diverse groups (as captured by skin color), often speak the same language as
former European colonizers, Spanish, English or Portuguese. So a classification based purely on language shows a much lower degree of fractionalization
than one that includes racial characteristics. In fact our linguistic fractionalization index leads to an average of 0.16 versus an average of 0.42 for the
ethnicity index. The Soviet index is closer to our linguistic index. Note how
Sub-Saharan Africa displays the highest index of fractionalization in every
single column. Appendix 1 displays these figures country by country.
Restricting our attention to countries with more than one million inhabitants, according to our data the most ethnically diverse country in the world
is Uganda, with a fractionalization index of 0.93. The 13 most ethnically
diverse countries are all in Sub-Saharan Africa, followed by Yugoslavia and
then 7 more Sub-Saharan African countries. The least ethnically fractionalized countries are South Korea, Japan and North Korea. Turning to linguistic fractionalization, the most diverse countries are again 18 Sub-Saharan
African countries (note that the definition of ethnicity there largely overlaps
with linguistic distinctions). They are followed by India, with a linguistic
fractionalization index of 0.81. The least diverse countries are South Korea
and North Korea, followed by Yemen. Finally, turning to religious fractionalization, the most diverse countries are South Africa, the United States
and Australia, and the least diverse Yemen, Somalia, Morocco, Turkey and
Algeria.

Fractionalization and Growth

In this section we revisit the question of the relationship between fractionalization and long-run growth. For the sake of comparison, we closely follow
the specification of Easterly and Levine (1997). We begin in Table 4 by
showing the correlation between several economic variables of interest and
our three measures of fractionalization: ethnic, linguistic and religious. Our
ethnic variable is highly negatively correlated with GDP per capita growth,
schooling and telephones per capita. These correlations are slightly lower for
the linguistic measure. The measure of religious fractionalization does not
seem to bear any pattern of correlations with the above mentioned variables.
Table 5 is organized exactly in the same way as Easterly and Levine’s
(1997) Table 4. This table shows that our measure of ethnic fractionalization is inversely related to per capita growth, as shown in Column 1. The
10

next three columns show that as one controls for more and more variables,
the eﬀect of fractionalization vanishes. The point is that variables such
as schooling, telephones per worker, etc., can be understood as channels
through which the ethnic fractionalization variable aﬀects growth. Table
6 highlights this by reproducing Table 6 of Easterly and Levine (1997).
It shows that ethnic fractionalization is strongly negatively correlated with
schooling, financial depth, fiscal surplus, and the log of telephones per worker
(these results are the same as in Easterly and Levine except for the fiscal
surplus, where Easterly and Levine did not find a significant association).
This negative eﬀect of racial fractionalization on infrastructure and productive public goods will be discussed in more detail in the next section. Since
ethnic fractionalization aﬀects variables that in turn aﬀect growth, there is a
reduced form relationship between these variables and growth. The partial
association between growth and fractionalization vanishes once we control
for the intermediating variables.
In terms of economic magnitudes, the results in Table 5 suggest that
going from complete ethnic homogeneity (an index of 0) to complete heterogeneity (an index of 1) depresses annual growth by 1.9 percentage points
(column 1). In other words, up to 1.77 percentage points of the diﬀerence
in annual growth between South Korea and Uganda can be explained by
diﬀerent degrees of ethnic fractionalization. This eﬀect is reduced as we
control for variables that can be interpreted as channels through which ethnic fractionalization aﬀects growth.
In Tables 7 and 9 we rerun the same regressions as in Table 5, but using
religious fractionalization and linguistic fractionalization. While linguistic
fractionalization is strongly inversely related to growth, religious fractionalization is not. In fact, as Table 4 already showed religious fractionalization
does not seem to be correlated with any of the other right-hand side variable.
Instead linguistic fractionalization is, especially with telephones per workers
and schooling, a result which is confirmed in Tables 8 and 10 and in the
next section. Overall our results are quite similar to those of Easterly and
Levine (1997), perhaps even a little stronger when using our new measure
of linguistic fractionalization.
The diﬀerences in the results between religious and linguistic and ethnic
fractionalization are quite suggestive. Religious aﬃliation is the most endogenous of the three variables. Religions can be banned and individual can
relatively easily “hide” their religious aﬃliation to avoid repression. Individuals and families can change from one religion to another far more easily
than they can change race (!) or language. In a sense, a higher observed
11

measure of religious fractionalization can be a sign of a more tolerant and
democratic form of government. In a more repressive regime, you can hide
your religion or conform to the state-imposed religion, but hiding your racial
origin, especially if it relates to skin color, is much more diﬃcult. Short of
genocide, it is diﬃcult to change the ethnic composition of a country. As
early as 1830, Tocqueville had noted this problem with reference to slavery
in America. He wrote that “there is a natural prejudice that prompts men
to despise whoever has been their inferior long after he has become their
equal... But amongst the ancients this secondary consequence of slavery
had a natural limit; for the freedman bore so entire a resemblance to those
born free that it soon became impossible to distinguish him from them”. In
the United States, instead, skin color diﬀerences between blacks and whites
makes assimilation more diﬃcult. In other words, skin color becomes an
important focal point to characterize lasting diﬀerences and perceptions, as
also argued by Caselli and Coleman (2002).

Fractionalization and Government Quality

One of the reasons why ethnic fractionalization may negatively influence
economic success in terms of growth and level of income has to do with the
potentially negative eﬀects of ethnic conflict on the quality of policy and
of institutions. In a sweeping empirical study La Porta et al. (1999) have
investigated the determinants of the quality of government and of policy
outcomes looking and a large number of indicators of policy. They concluded that a country’s legal origins are an important determinant of these
variables, while the ethnic fractionalization variable (the same as used by
Easterly and Levine (1997)) bore a reduced form relationship with government quality. However, fractionalization was typically not significant after
controlling for the level of GDP per capita (which however could be endogenous) and latitude.
Table 11 reports a matrix of correlation between all the variables used as
potential explanation of the quality of government. Note that our measures
of linguistic and ethnic fractionalization are highly correlated with latitude
and GDP per capita. Therefore it is quite diﬃcult to disentangle the independent eﬀect of these three variables on the quality of government. While
GDP per capita is very likely to be endogenous to the left-hand side variables, so that it is unclear whether one should control for it or not, the other
two variables are less endogenous. Also, ethnic fractionalization and latitude
are less obviously linked by causal relationships than the same two variables
12

are with income. The correlation between latitude and ethnic fractionalization is quite high, about 0.4. This makes it hard to disentangle the eﬀect
of one variable from the other and the result in this type of cross-sectional
regressions will depend on the specification. On a priori grounds, while one
can think of several reasons why ethnic conflict may aﬀect policy outcomes
and institutions, the relationship between latitude and, say, the regulation
of economic activity or the protection of property rights seems much less
obvious.
The measure of religious fragmentation displays a much lower level of correlation with GDP per capita; in fact this correlation is basically zero. Our
ethnic fractionalization variable displays a positive correlation (0.2) with the
dummy variables for French legal origins, which according to La Porta et al.
(1999) is associated with poor quality of government. This does not help in
separating the eﬀects of legal origins from those of fractionalization.
In Tables 12a-h we run a set of regressions along the lines of La Porta et
al. (1999). These tables are organized as follows. Let us begin with Table
12a. For each left-hand side variable, we present three regressions. The
first one reproduces exactly the full specification of La Porta et al. (1999),
i.e. their specification which include the largest number of independent
variables, that is legal origins, religious variables, latitude, etc. To these
variables we have added our measure of ethnic fractionalization. Column
2 present a minimalist specification, which includes only country size and
regional dummies. The third column adds to this specification income per
capita and legal origins variables. For brevity we do not report another column including also the religious variables, but the results (available upon
request) are similar to those of column 3. Note that the omitted legal origins
variable is the British one. Tables 12b-h have the same structure, with diﬀerent dependent variables. Tables 13a-h and 14a-h replicate these regressions
with, respectively, the measures of linguistic and religious fractionalization.
Several observations are in order.
1) Our index of ethnic fractionalization is significant in the “minimalist” regression, Column 2, for corruption, bureaucratic delays, infrastructure
quality, infant mortality, illiteracy, and school attainment. It is significant
or nearly significant in Column 3 that controls for GDP per capita for corruption, infant mortality, and illiteracy. The sign of the coeﬃcient always
implies that more fractionalization leads to a lower quality of government.
This index is also negatively associated with the share of transfers over GDP,
a result consistent with those obtained by Alesina, Glaeser and Sacerdote
(2001) on a much smaller sample of countries, and by Alesina and Wacziarg
13

(1998) on a large sample of countries but with diﬀerent data on government spending.12 It seems that governments have a much more diﬃcult
task achieving consensus for redistribution to the needy in a fractionalized
society.
2) The democracy index is inversely related to ethnic fractionalization
(when latitude is not controlled for). This result is consistent with theory
and evidence presented in Aghion, Alesina and Trebbi (2002). The idea is
that in more fragmented societies a group imposes restrictions on political
liberty to impose control on the other groups. In more homogeneous societies, it is easier to rule more democratically since conflicts are less intense.13
3) Overall the index of linguistic fractionalization seems to work less
well than the index based on ethnicity, in the sense of leading to coeﬃcients
that are less robust to changes of specification and more often statistically
insignificant.
4) The index of religious fractionalization bears a positive relationship
to controlling corruption, preventing bureaucratic delays, tax compliance,
transfers, infrastructure quality, lower infant mortality, lower illiteracy, school
attainment, democracy, and political rights. Note that this result holds regardless of whether the size of various religious denominations is held constant in the regressions or not. Our interpretation is that observed religious
fragmentation is larger in more tolerant countries.
5) The index of ethnic fractionalization loses statistical significance in
many of the regressions with the full specification used by of La Porta et al.
(1999). This is because these regressions include latitude and, as we argued
above, this variable is highly correlated with ethnic fractionalization. The
ethnic fractionalization variable remains significant at standard levels even
after controlling for latitude in the case of infant mortality, and the share of
state-owned enterprises. In virtually all other cases the ethnic fractionalization variable retains the “expected” sign but it is not statistically diﬀerent
from zero at standard levels of confidence. This reflects the diﬃculty in disentangling the eﬀects of latitude, per capita income (which again may not
belong in the regression due to endogeneity), and fractionalization.
12

These papers questioned Rodrik’s view (1998) that the size of government is driven
by openness in the economy, an issue that we do not explore here.
13
These authors present additional evidence precisely on this point using the same data
on ethnic fractionalization collected for the present paper. This is consistent with the
fact that relatively homogeneous settler colonies like the US, Canada, New Zealand and
Australia had an easier time establishing democracy after independence than the more
ethnically diverse former colonies in Latin America and Africa.

14

6) In many regressions neither latitude nor ethnic fractionalization are
significant but they both tend to be when introduced alone. The table does
not show the case in which latitude is entered without ethnic fractionalization, but these results are available upon request.
7) Not surprisingly, since we are using the same data, we confirm results
in La Porta and al. (1999) on legal origins. French and Socialist legal origins
seem to be negatively associated with measures of quality of government.
The bottom line is that the evaluation of the eﬀect of ethnic fragmentation on quality of government depends on whether one believes that latitude belongs in the regression or not. If one believes that geography is the
leading explanation of corruption, tax compliance, democracy, freedom etc.
then one could find confirmation of these priors in these results. If, instead
one believes that conflicts amongst groups brings about more diﬃcult and
ineﬃcient policymaking and that ethnic fractionalization happens to be correlated with latitude (or constitutes a channel or explanation through which
the latitude variable operates), then one can find support for this set of
priors in our results as well.

Polarization

Our measures of fractionalization, while the most widespread in the literature, are not the only measures of ethnic, religious and linguistic heterogeneity available. In particular, scholars have recently started to calculate
and use measures of polarization, rather than fractionalization.14 Holding
the “distance” between groups constant, polarization is typically maximized
when there are two groups of equal size, whereas fractionalization increases
when there are many small groups. Additionally, the degree of polarization
should increase as the distance between groups increases. When it comes
to ethnic, linguistic and religious groups, however, the concept of distance
is hard to capture with simple measures, so that researchers have implicitly
assumed that the distance between groups is constant across group pairs.15
14

See for instance Garcia-Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2002).
A recent eﬀort to generate an index of “cultural distance” appears in Fearon (2002).
He noticed that linguists classify languages in trees - two languages on the same branch
of a linguistic tree are “closer” to each other than two languages on a diﬀerent branch.
Linguistic trees can therefore be used to approximate the distance between linguistic
groups. Eﬀorts to similarly measure the distance between ethnic groups and religions
should be at the forefront of the data gathering eﬀort in fractionalization research. We
are not aware of such attempts.
15

15

Whether societal conflict is the result of fractionalization or polarization
is largely an unresolved question in theory, calling for empirical work. The
discussion of whether a country with many relatively small groups is more
or less stable than one with only two equally sized groups is an old one,
and goes back at least to Madison in the Federalist Papers of 1788 (nos. 10
and 11 see Hamilton et al., 1911). Without much of a stretch of Madison’s
views, one can argue that a polarization measure is, according to him, the
appropriate concept to capture heterogeneity. In what follows, we extend
our estimates of the eﬀects of ethnic, religious and linguistic heterogeneity
on growth and government quality using measures of polarization.
Esteban and Ray (1994) develop a theory of polarization and axiomatically derive a measure of income polarization with “desirable” features.16
They show that a desirable measure of polarization must take the form:
n
n X
X
P (s, y) = K
s1+α
sj |yi − yj |
i

(2)

i=1 j=1

where K is a constant, α is a constant between 0 and ' 1.6, and yi is the
income of group i = 1...n (polarization here is defined with respect to income
- it is presumed there is no within group variation in income). This defines
a fairly narrow class of measures, since the only degrees of freedom are K
(a scaling factor) and α. In order to compute this measure for ethnically
defined groups we need a measure of the distance between groups (the analog
of |yi − yj | in equation (2)). Lacking such a measure, the empirical literature
has had to assume that the distance between every group is the same.17
We have repeated all the previous estimations using the measure of polarization based on (2) rather than fractionalization. For brevity we do not
report all the results, which are available upon request. We set K = 1 and
considered three values of α - the two extreme values 0 and 1.6, and an inter16

The axioms imposed on polarization measures are the analogs of the Dalton Axiom
for the measurement of inequality. See also Duclos, Esteban and Ray (2002) for a generalization.
17
Garcia-Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2002) use the following specification:
¶2
n µ
X
0.5 − si
si
P OLi = 1 −
0.5
i=1
They show that this index can be derived from a model of lobbying. Note that this index
reaches a maximum of 1 when there are two equally sized groups in the country.

16

mediate value of 0.8.18 In a context where we have to assume that |yi − yj |
is constant for all i 6= j, it is easy to show that a value of α = 0 leads to a
measure that is perfectly correlated with the fractionalization measure presented earlier if and only if every group in a country’s population is observed
(so that the sum of observed group shares equals 1).19
A summary of our results is as follows:
1). The polarization indices, especially when computed with an α around
the middle of the feasible range (i.e. around 0.8), are highly correlated
with the fractionalization measures. This is due to the assumption of equal
distance between all groups within a given country, an assumption required
by our lack of data on those distances.
2). We find that polarization indices with α equal to 0.8 perform relatively better than those with an extreme value of 1.6. Thus the index
of polarization that works better is the one that is most correlated with
fractionalization.
3). In the growth regressions, the results seems substantially weaker
using the polarization index. When both indices are used together, the
fragmentation index typically remains significant and the polarization index
is not.
4). In the quality of government regressions the index of ethnic fractionalization works slightly better than the corresponding index of polarization.
In these regressions, because of the high correlation between the two indices,
when they are used together the results are generally not easily interpretable.
5). We obtain poor results using linguistic polarization in the quality of
government regressions whatever the value of α.
6). As for the fractionalization index, religious polarization is associated
with better performances in the areas of regulation, red tape, corruption,
tax compliance, transfers and political rights, especially when α has an intermediate value of 0.8. Higher religious polarization is also associated with
better public goods, lower infant mortality and illiteracy rates, higher levels
of schooling and better infrastructure.
18
Esteban and Ray (1994) do not point to which value was “better” to capture polarization - all values of α in the specified range satisfy the properties that the class of
polarization measures should satisfy. There is therefore no a priori reason to prefer one
value over the other.
19
Thus, in practice a measure based on α = 0 does not add anything to our earlier
results, so we abstain from commenting on the corresponding results.

17

The bottom line is that the measure of polarization produces similar but
slightly worse results than the result with fractionalization when we choose
a parameter value for α that makes the correlation between the two indices
high. When the choose of parameter values makes the polarization index
less correlated with fractionalization, the latter is a better predictor of our
outcome variables.
Garcia-Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2002) show that their index of polarization predicts civil wars better than fractionalization. Their results and
ours are not contradictory. It may very well be the case that a civil war
is more likely when two large equally size group face each other than when
many small groups are present. A war is also more likely when the two
groups are roughly of equal size than when one is clearly predominant since
in that case the dominant one can more easily repress the other one and
avoid war. However, the quality of policy may be specially bad when many
groups fight over public resources.

The eﬀects of ethnic conflict: A few examples

A cross-country statistical exercise is a crude way to summarize complex
political and economic histories of countries and their constituent ethnic
groups. A promising direction for future research would be for economists
to do more case histories of development, economic policy, and government
quality in ethnically diverse places, of the kind that the political science
literature does.
In this sections we briefly examine some individual data points to illustrate salient ethnic divisions as well as the complex history that lies behind
our cross-section associations. Nigeria has among the highest ethnic and
linguistic diversity in the entire sample, and was also ranked as highly diverse by Easterly and Levine (1997). Maier (2000) makes clear it would be
hard to find a better example of institutional and policy failure leading to
underdevelopment. Nigeria has produced $280 billion in oil revenues since
the discovery of reserves in the late 1950s, but the average Nigerian is no
further out of poverty today than 4 decades ago. Such egregious failures as
the $8 billion state-owned Ajaokuta steel complex, which has yet to produce
a bar of steel, give a hint of the breakdown of state institutions. The standard account of Nigeria’s ethnic conflict pits the Muslim North versus the
Christian South, but this is a simplification. Firstly, the Christian South
is divided between the Yoruba and Igbo. Secondly, there are substantial
Southern minority groups living in Northern cities, a situation that has led
18

to recurrent communal violence. Thirdly, fractious ethnic groups in the center of the country and in the oil-rich Niger delta keep small-scale conflict
going even out of the limelight of the Hausa/Yoruba/Igbo three-way ethnic war. Table 15 shows that Nigeria has had disastrous economic policies
(high black market premiums), poor infrastructure (virtually no telephone
density) and high corruption.
Ethiopia also has very high ethnic and linguistic diversity (according to
both new and old measures), and ethnic conflict has been at the center of
Ethiopian history for centuries. Ethiopia has had one of the lowest growth
rates in the world over the past half-century and as a result remains one
of the least developed nations in the world. It has known various types
of regimes, from monarchy to Marxist-Leninist to reformist, but growth
has been mediocre to poor under all of them. Political/ethnic conflict and
disastrous institutions have partly caused and certainly magnified the eﬀects
of major disasters such as famine, AIDS, civil war, and international war,
and these disasters have absorbed a high share of the government’s paltry
aid and tax revenues.
The current government is dominated by the Tigray Peoples’s Liberation Front, representing an ethnic group making up only 6 percent of the
population. The latter is alleged to own a large number of agricultural,
industrial and financial businesses under the umbrella of the Endowment
Fund for the Rehabilitation of Tigray.20 The current government is attempting to prevent ethnic conflicts by decentralizing power to ethnically
defined regions, including the promotion of local languages. However, this
strategy remains deeply controversial. At one extreme, some observers see
it as a ploy by the Tigrayan ruling elite to divide the potential opposition
along ethnic lines, as well as to undercut the national government bureaucracy. The rulers are alleged to have co-opted participants from other ethnic
groups rather than allowed representative organizations to emerge. There
are also accusations of a second level of oppression, this time by the dominant majority group in each region oppressing the regional minorities (on
some accounts, there are over 80 ethnic groups in Ethiopia, but only 9 regions). Some Ethiopians decry the threat to the unity and identity of the
country and the “ethnicization” of politics. Of course, ethnicization is far
from new, given the long-standing Amhara dominance of the state, and its
“colonization” of other “nationalities”. Some see the current government as
simply substituting Tigray dominance for Amhara dominance (see Tronvoll
(2000)).
20

Abegaz (2001), p. 207.

19

More charitable observers see government policy as an honest attempt
to address the ethnic divisions that have bedeviled Ethiopia for much of its
history (today there continues to be an armed insurgency by the Oromo Liberation Front).21 These observers see the current government as responding
to this history of domination by the Amhara by granting autonomy to the
“nationalities.”
Botswana is an interesting exception to the poor economic outcomes
and low quality government in most of Africa. The table shows it had
high growth, a low black market premium, a government surplus, and low
corruption. While we do not mean to give a monocausal explanation for this
success, it is notable that it has relatively low ethnic diversity for Africa.
Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) describe how the Tswana tribes
had a long history of cooperation amongst themselves before independence,
as well as generally inclusive institutions since.
Ethiopia and Nigeria were already highly diverse relative to Botswana
in the old Easterly and Levine (1997) dataset. Even more interesting is
the much higher degree of ethnic diversity in some Latin American and
Caribbean countries according to our new ethnic fractionalization measure.
Among the poorest, most institutionally underdeveloped, and most conflictridden societies in this region are Bolivia, Ecuador, and Guyana. All of
these score lower on linguistic fractionalization (and hence did not show up
as very ethnically diverse in Easterly and Levine (1997)) than on ethnic
fractionalization, because of racial diﬀerences. A Latin American success
story, Chile, continues to show up as relatively homogeneous.
To take Bolivia as an example, whites (about 10 percent of the population) dominated the governments of Bolivia with systematic exploitation of
mestizos, Aymara, and Quechua peoples from colonial times to 1952 (Klein
(1992)). Six percent of landowners owned 92 percent of the land in 1950.
There were feudal anachronisms such as an obligation for Indian tenants to
spend part of their time as unpaid servants in the landowner’s household.
A literacy requirement prevented the majority of the population from voting. The Indians successfully revolted in 1952, redistributed land towards
the peasants, and abolished the more obvious exclusionary laws. However,
whites continued to dominate politics and economics. Political instability
remained endemic after 1952, with frequent military coups overthrowing
democratic regimes. Democracy has been restored since 1982, but racial
conflict continues. When one of the authors visited Bolivia in early 2002,
21

See Marcus 1994 on the complicated history of ethnic groups in Ethiopia.

20

Indian activists were blockading the main roads surrounding La Paz to articulate various grievances. A meeting of the leaders of the 1952 revolutionary
party was conspicuous for its lack of Indian representation. Anecdotally, it
appeared that racist sentiments towards the Indians still existed amongst
the white elite. Bolivia still has poor growth, high corruption, poor social
service delivery, and predatory police and judges.
Guyana shows up as ethnically diverse in our data because of its racial
breakdown between Africans, East Indians, Europeans, and others. The
Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese are the predominant groups and are almost numerically equal. Since they have mobilized politically along ethnic
lines (supporting two diﬀerent parties since before independence), any consensus for development has been torn apart by competition for rents between
the two groups.22 As Table 15 shows, Guyana is rated as one of the most
corrupt countries in the world, has followed distortionary economic policies,
and has had very poor growth outcomes.
Chile, in contrast, is a well known Latin American success story. It
has pursued free market reforms since the 1970s under first military and
later democratically elected governments. Although it did have political
and economic gyrations under Allende in the early 1970s and then a debt
crisis and severe political repression under Pinochet in the early 1980s, the
last twenty years have shown a high degree of political and economic stability and sustained growth. By the 1980s, Chile had also achieved a high
level of schooling and infrastructure (Table 15). There are certainly many
causes explaining why reforms were made possible, in particular the authoritarian and repressive nature of the Pinochet regime, which made it easier
to eliminate opposition to reform. After the period of repression a considerable amount of consensus emerged on policy. Many other developing
countries experienced bloody coups, and did not evolve into peaceful and
rapidly growing economies. The diﬀerence in Chile was probably due to its
higher level of homogeneity. In fact, after Pinochet’s departure from power
the new democratic regime showed remarkable stability by Latin American standards. The relative ethnic homogeneity of the society may have
made achieving support for reform and economic development easier than
in Bolivia or Guyana.

Conclusion

The question of what makes diﬀerent countries more or less successful economically and what explains the quality of their policies is one of the most
fascinating that economists can ask, but it is also one of the most diﬃcult to
answer. Diﬀerent authors have their own “favorite” explanatory variables:
from purely “economic” ones, to geographic ones, to legal ones, to political, cultural, religious and historical ones. In this paper we have considered
closely one such set of variables: measures of ethnic, linguistic and religious
fractionalization.
Dealing with this type of variables raises two problems. One is a measurement: how to measure ethnicity is a delicate and diﬃcult matter. Secondly,
the patterns of correlations between potential explanatory factors makes it
diﬃcult to unambiguously answer the question of why certain countries have
better policies than others. In this paper we have made some progress on
both fronts. Firstly, on the measurement issue we provided a new set of
fractionalization variables for a much larger sample of countries than was
available before, and we put much eﬀort into solving classification issues using consistent criteria across countries. Secondly, using these new variables
we revisited empirical issues concerning the determinants of growth and of
quality of policies and institutions. We concluded that ethnic and linguistic fractionalization variables, more so than religious ones, are likely to be
important determinants of economic success, both in terms of output (GDP
growth), the quality of policies (such as the literacy rate, infant mortality
etc.) and the quality of institutions (measured by the extent of corruption,
political freedom, etc.). However, it is diﬃcult to evaluate precisely the
size of these eﬀects because of the strong correlation of ethnolinguistic fractionalization variables with other potential explanatory variables, especially
geographical ones. In the end one has to use theory and priors to interpret
our partial correlations.

Interference with the private sector:
Property
A rating of property rights in each country (on a
rights
scale of 1 to 5). The more protection private
index
property receives, the higher the score. The score
is based, broadly, on the degree of legal protection
of private property, the extent to which the
government protects and enforces laws that
protect private property, the probability that the
government will expropriate private property, and
the country’s legal protection to private property.
Source: Holmes, Johnson, and Kirkpatrick, 1997.
Business
A rating of regulation policies related to opening a
Regulation
business and keeping open a business (on a scale
index
of 1 to 5). Higher score means that regulations
are straight-forward and applied uniformly to all
businesses and that regulations are less of a
burden to business. Source: Holmes, Johnson and
Kirkpatrick, 1997.
Top tax rate
Top marginal tax rate for each country in 1994.

Efficiency:
Corruption
Corruption in government index. Low ratings
indicate “high government officials are likely to
demand special payments” and “illegal payments
are generally expected thought lower levels of
government” in the form of “bribes connected
with import and export licenses, exchange
controls, tax assessment, policy protection, or
loans.” Scale from 0 to 10. Average of the
months of April and October in the monthly index
between 1982 and 1995. Source: Political Risk
Services, various years.
Bureaucratic
An indicator of bureaucratic delays (red tape).
delays
High ratings indicate lower levels of red tape in
the bureaucracy of the country. Scale from 0 to
10. The index is published three times per year.
The data is the average of the years between 1972
and 1995. Source: Business Environmental Risk

Determinants:
Ethnolinguistic
fractionalization

Average value of five different indices of
ethonolinguistic fractionalization. Its value ranges
from 0 to 1. The five component indices are: (1)
index of ethonolinguistic fractionalization in
1960, which measures the probability that two
randomly selected people from a given country
will not belong to the same ethonolinguistic
group(the index is based on the number and size
of population groups as distinguished by their
ethnic and linguistic status); (2) probability of two
randomly selected individuals speaking different
languages; (3) probability of two randomly
selected individuals do not speak the same
language; (4) percent of the population not
speaking the official language; and (5) percent of
the population not speaking the most widely used
language. Sources: Easterly and Levine, 1997.
The sources of the components of the average
index are (1) Atlas Narodov Mira, 1964;
(2)Muller, 1964; (3) Roberts, 1962; (4) and (5)
Gunnemark, 1991.
Legal origin
Identifies the legal origin of the Company law or
Commercial Code of each country. There are five
possible origins: (1) English Common Law; (2)
French Commercial Code; (3) German
Commercial Code; (4) Scandinavian Commercial
Code; and (5) Socialist/Communist laws. Source:
La Porta et al., 1998, extended using “Foreign
Laws: Current Sources of Basic Legislation in
Jurisdictions of the World,” 1989; and CIA World
Factbook 1996.
Religion
Identifies the percentage of the population of each
country that belonged to the three most widely
spread religions in the world in 1980. For
countries of recent formation, the data is available
for 1990-1995. The numbers are in percent (scale
from 0 to 100). The three religions identified here
are: (1) Roman Catholic; (2) Protestant; and (3)
Muslim. The residual is called “other religions”.
