Efficiency and the Bear: Short Sales and Markets around the World

JEL No. G0
ABSTRACT
We analyze cross-sectional and time series information from forty-seven equity markets
around the world, to consider whether short-sales restrictions affect the efficiency of the market, and
the distributional characteristics of returns to individual stocks and market indices. Using the
approach developed in Morck et.al. (2000) we find significantly more cross-sectional variation in
equity returns in markets where short selling is feasible and practiced, controlling for a host of other
factors. This evidence is consistent with more efficient price discovery at the individual security
level. A common conjecture by regulators is that short-selling restrictions can reduce the relative
severity of a market panic. We test this conjecture by examining the skewness of market returns. We
find that in markets where short selling is either prohibited or not practiced, returns display
significantly less negative skewness, and the frequency of extreme negative returns is lower. On the
other hand, the overall volatility of individual returns and market returns is higher.

Introduction

In February of 1609, a group of well-connected Dutch businessmen, led by one of the
original subscribers to the Dutch East India Company, Isaac Le Maire, formed a secret
association, a “Groote Companie, ” to short the shares in the East India Company in anticipation
of the incorporation of a rival French-chartered trading firm. Le Maire and his colleagues sold
shares forward in a “blanco” transaction promising future delivery in one or two years. Over the
next twelve months, their profits mounted, as East India Company shares dropped by 12%,
angering shareholders who inevitably learned of their plan. In January of 1610, a year after the
formation of the “Groote Companie” and only three years after the official founding of the
Amsterdam Exchange, the first regulation against short selling was enacted. Share prices
rebounded, a rival French company was not formed and Isaac Le Maire never succeeded in
disentangling himself from the litigation that ensued.1
At various times over the next four hundred years, short–sellers have been blamed for stock
market declines, and market participants have called for regulation against short sales.2
However, despite centuries of disagreement between speculators and regulators on the topic, no
one really knows whether short–sales constraints are a good or a bad thing. As the above
example indicates, short–sales restrictions are nearly as old as organized exchanges, and yet
there is little empirical evidence on whether they prevent or facilitate market crashes, or whether
they hinder or help rational price discovery.
In this paper, we use cross-sectional and time series information from forty-seven equity
markets from around the world to examine the question of whether short–sales restrictions affect

the efficiency of the market and the distributional characteristics of individual as well as market
returns. We obtain information regarding the history and current practice of short–sales
restrictions from market regulators, investment banks, and institutional investors specialized in
short sales. This dataset allows us to characterize each country in terms of the legality, as well as
the practice, of short selling for the period 1990–2001. Using the approach developed in Mørck,
Yeung and Yu (2000) [MYY] we find significantly more cross-sectional variation in equity
returns in markets where short selling is feasible and practiced, controlling for a host of other
factors. This evidence is consistent with more efficient price discovery at the individual security
level.
A common conjecture by regulators is that short–sales restrictions can reduce the
severity of price declines. We test this conjecture by examining the skewness of market returns.
We find some evidence in favor of the conjecture. That is, we find that the lifting of short–sales
restrictions is associated with increased negative skewness in individual stock returns. Our result
is thus consistent with the regulatory views of Samuel Untermyer, legal counsel to the 1913
Pujo Committee of Congress investigating money trusts. In his devastating questioning of Frank
Stugis, president of the New York Stock Exchange from 1894 to 1898, Untermyer succinctly
articulated the public fear of short selling during a financial crisis.
Untermyer: Under what circumstances would you regard… short selling as legitimate
and proper?
Stugis: I should regard it so if there was a panic raging over the country and it was
desirable to protect interests which could not be sold. I think it would be a perfectly
legitimate thing to do.
Untermyer: Let us see about that. If there was a panic raging over the country and a man
sold stocks short, would not that simply add to the panic?

Stugis: It might. Self preservation is the first law of nature.3

This view is echoed by one of the regulators whom we contacted to obtain data for our
sample. In his words: “forbidding short selling prevents big market swings since the market size
is limited.” Our analysis sheds light on the costs and benefits of short–sales regulation at the
individual security level and at the market level. On the one hand, our data strongly support the
view that short selling facilitates efficient price discovery—at least to the extent that efficiency
is captured empirically by the lack of synchronous movement in daily returns. On the other
hand, short selling may also facilitate severe price declines in individual securities, at least as
defined in terms of negative skewness. Despite the relationship between short sales constraints
and skewness at the individual security level, we find little compelling evidence that short–sales
constraints prevent or mitigate severe price declines at the market level. In particular, we do not
find that short–sales constraints prevent market crashes. Figure 1 summarizes our findings
regarding the skewness of the market and the synchronicity of stock returns. We plot both
variables depending on whether countries allow and commonly practice short sales or not. In
this figure we do not control for a number of factors that potentially influence co-movement and
skewness, however the raw data is somewhat instructive. Countries in which short–sales are
practiced display less co-movement and modestly more negative skewness.
[Insert Figure 1 here]
Note that some countries — Hong Kong, Malaysia, Norway, Sweden, and Thailand —
appear twice on the figure. This is because they lifted short–sales constraints in the period of
our study. For example, short–sales restrictions for Sweden were eliminated in 1991. Before
that date, 93 percent of the stocks moved together, and the market skewness was –0.50. In the
3

Untermyer, Samuel, 1915, “Speculation on the Stock Exchanges and Public Regulation of the Exchanges,”

3

period since 1991, the comovement of stocks declined to 76 percent, and the market skewness
increased to -0.04. Sweden’s positional shift in the figure is the common pattern among the
countries that relaxed short–sales constraints.4 The international evidence shown in Figure 1 at
least suggests that short–sales might play an important role in efficiency and market crash
probability. In the remainder of this paper, we investigate these potential relationships in
econometric detail.
The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we review the current literature on
short–sales and discuss our contributions in the context of related research. In Section 3 we
summarize the range of short–sales regulations and practices in markets around the world.
Section 4 reports the results of the MYY test of relative pricing efficiency. Section 5 reports the
statistical characteristics of market and security returns associated with short–sales and tests for
differences in skewness conditional upon restrictions. Section 6 concludes.

Literature Review

Short–sales play an important role in asset pricing models and the theory of portfolio choice.
Most neo-classical models in finance (c.f. Ross, 1976) rely upon the ability of market
participants to take off-setting positions in close economic substitutes in order to enforce a law
of one price. Considerable research in the last decade has explored the effects of short–sales and
frictions in an asset market. For example, Luttmer (1993), Chen (1995, 2001), He and Modest
(1997), Hansen and Jagannathan (1997), Jouini and Kallal (2001), Duffie, Garleanu and
Pedersen (2002) all address the effect of market frictions and seek to characterize the magnitude
of mispricing that may obtain. Diamond and Verecchia (1987) explore the effects of short–sales

American Economic Review, 5(1) Supplement, Papers and Proceedings, pages 24-68.

Section VI.A in the paper shows that the difference in skewness before and after the change in regulation is not
significantly different from zero.

constraints on the speed of price-adjustment to private information. Recently, Hong and Stein
(2002) develop a heterogeneous agent model linking short–sales constraints to market crashes.
In their model, if some investors are constrained from selling short, their accumulated
unrevealed negative information will not be manifest until the market begins to drop, which
further aggravates market declines and leads to a crash. They motivate the model with the
observation that the U.S. market displays negative skewness.
Most of the research cited above suggests that short–sales constraints have an adverse
effect on efficiency—the only question is how much. On the other hand, an interesting
exception is the argument of Allen and Gale (1991) who point out that the potential for financial
innovation renders short selling a destabilizing influence in the economy. This is potentially
interesting in light of our findings that short sales tend to be allowed in major markets where
financial innovations occur—particularly with respect to capital structure and new security
development -- and that these markets also tend to display relatively higher negative skewness
in returns. Bernardo and Welch (2002) develop a model describing how the fear of financial
crisis, instead of a real liquidity shock, is the true cause of financial crises. One implication of
their model is that putting constraints that hinder some market participants from front-running
other investors can effectively prevent financial crisis from happening, supporting the finding of
Allen and Gale (1991) that short sales can potentially destabilize the economy.
Empirical evidence on short selling largely supports the theoretical view that constraining it
hinders price discovery. In a recent paper, Jones and Lamont (2002) use early 20th Century U.S
data to show that stocks which are expensive to short have high valuations and low subsequent
returns. Their finding is consistent with the hypothesis that difficult-to-short stocks are overpriced. Using data on DotComs, Ofek and Richardson (2002) show that short–sales constraints,
in the form of stock option lock–ups, have considerable and persistent negative impact on

5

subsequent stock returns, also supporting the argument that stock prices do not fully incorporate
information under short–sales constraints. Geczy, Musto, and Reed (2002) use a comprehensive
dataset of short sales, and find that short–selling restrictions have a mixed impact on the
profitability of well–known arbitrage strategies.
Short selling requires the ability to borrow securities. As we will discuss in this study,
securities borrowing and lending can directly determine the costs of short selling and hence
should be considered in conjunction with short–sales constraints. In our empirical analysis, we
classify countries into categories according to whether short selling is practiced. Although short
selling is allowed in some countries, securities borrowing and lending is so limited that short
sales are not really feasible. D’Avolio (2002) provides empirical evidence about securities
borrowing and lending in U.S. stock markets that demonstrates considerable cross-sectional
variation in the feasibility of maintaining short positions, depending on the divergence of market
opinion.
Short selling is an important tool used by speculators to exploit over-priced securities.
Bekaert and Harvey (2000) explore the importance of speculators in emerging market
efficiency. They find that the cost of capital, an indicator of market efficiency, decreases after a
capital market liberalization. They stress the importance of a regulatory change to a country’s
openness to speculators—this would naturally extend to short–sales restrictions and thus our
work fits naturally into the literature on the globalization of capital markets. Harvey and coauthors have also contributed to our knowledge about skewness in returns, although their
findings are not explicitly connected to capital market regulatory changes per se. In a series of
studies, Harvey and Sidique (1999, 2000a, 200b) point out that return skewness appears to be
priced in both the U.S. and the world capital market. If regulators’ believe that short selling
regulation can indeed prevent market crises, then Harvey and Sidique’ research suggests that

6

there should be implications for expected returns and volatility in financial markets around the
world.
There are a few key empirical studies that seek to understand the impact of short–sales
regulations on return distributions using international data. Aitken et al. (1998) offer evidence
from the Australian Stock Exchange suggesting that short sales trades reflect significant bad
news about companies. Poitras (2002) concludes that rights issues trade below the arbitrage
boundary because of short sale restrictions on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES). Biais et
al. (1999) use data from the Paris Bourse and show that a market with short–sales constraints
reflects good news significantly faster than bad news. Li and Fleisher (2002), using Chinese
stock market data, find that the dispersion of domestic analysts’ forecasts is negatively
correlated to stock returns in the A-share market, where short–sales restrictions are binding, and
not significantly related to the return of B-shares where short–sales restrictions are not binding.
Studying the impact of short–sales constraints in an international setting avoids potential
country specific factors and generalizes the findings on short–sales regulations.
In sum, most theory and empirical evidence from the U.S. and non-U.S. markets suggest that
short–sales constraints are an impediment to price discovery—particularly when the news is
bad. Some theories argue that limiting short–sales may be necessary under certain conditions to
achieve equilibrium, however thus far there is no empirical test of the contrary proposition.

III.

Short–Sales Restrictions Around the World

Our main data source for short–sales regulation and practice is information provided by
investment banks. The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Global Network Management Division
(GNM) has compiled information regarding short–sales regulation, impediments and practices
from their global network of sub-custodian banks for 59 countries, and they made a summary of

7

this research available to us. We obtained similar information from the International Securities
Lending Division at Goldman Sachs (ISL). The ISL complements the information from GNM in
two important aspects. It provides detailed information on the tax effects of short positions, the
settlement cycle of short sales, and the registration requirements for shorting in 46 countries.
There are some countries for which the GNM and ISL data indicates that short selling is not
practiced despite the fact that a widely used guide, the Worldwide Directory of Securities
Lending and Repo (WDSLP), lists institutional investors involved in short sales in those
countries. In these cases, we contacted the listed institutions to understand the discrepancy. In
most cases we found they were not active in short sales, or else they were mostly focused on
securities lending. An exception is Singapore where it appears that, even though short selling is
not formally allowed, it is widely practiced, although short sales are typically executed offexchange between depository agents. We obtained additional information on securities trading,
settlement and tax laws from the International Securities Services Association (ISSA)
Handbook, however ISSA only provides current information on these issues.
In addition to information provided by investment banks, industry publications and
market participants, we contacted the equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commissions
of the 59 countries in the GNM dataset to learn what we could from them about regulation and
practice. Information from market regulators was particularly useful in allowing us to track the
history of short–sales regulations for each country over the last fifteen years. With their help we
are able to examine some key regulatory regime shifts in our empirical analysis. We found in
general that the information provided by practitioners was more detailed than the information
from regulators, although it should not be surprising that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter know more about market practice than regulators themselves. For instance, in one
case, regulators told us that short–selling was not practiced in their market, while ISL indicated

8

that most of the short–selling transactions for that market take place offshore—outside the
purview of the regulatory agency. What regulators may lack in specific knowledge about market
practice they typically make up for in interest in the current project. Many of the regulatory
agencies we contacted expressed a strong desire to learn the results of our study, because the
question of the efficacy of short–sales restrictions continue to be an issue of interest.
Our information about short–sales regulations and practice is summarized in Table 1.
Out of the 59 countries in the GNM dataset, we exclude the countries for which we could not
find individual firm stock price data. This leaves a sample of 47 countries. In 35 of them, short
selling is currently allowed, at least as of December 2001, the final date of our sample period. In
12 of these 47, short–sales were prohibited for the entire sample period of January, 1990 to
December, 2001. In 12 of the 35 countries where short–sales are currently allowed, restrictions
existed in 1990 but were lifted at some point within the sample period. These countries are:
Chile, Hong Kong, Hungary, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Spain,
Sweden, Thailand, and Turkey. In three cases—Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Thailand—
restrictions on short selling were removed and later re-enacted gradually.5

5

In Malaysia, the Securities Commission issued in December 1995 the Guidelines on Securities Borrowing and
Lending, and the Securities Industry Act of 1993 was amended to allow short sales. The regulatory changes came
into force on March 7, 1996, and allowed the local exchange—the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange—to enact short–
selling rules. With that, regulated short selling commenced on September 30, 1996. However, in August 28, 1997,
and in the onset of the Asian financial crises, these activities were suspended as interim measures to prevent
excessive volatility in the markets. In February, 2001 the Securities Commission launched a plan—the Capital
Market Masterplan—that recommended the re-introduction of short selling and securities lending activities.
In Hong Kong, short selling was prohibited before January 3, 1994. The SEHK then allowed 17 out of the 33
constituent stocks of the Hang Seng Index (HSI) to be sold short subject to several restrictions. These restrictions
were lifted on March 25, 1996 at the same time that 113 of the firms listed on the exchange, including all the
constituent stocks of the index, were allowed to be sold short.
In Thailand, the Securities Exchange Commission first enforced short–sales regulations on July, 1997, suspending
them because of the currency crises. Beginning on January 1, 1998, short sales were allowed again in the Thai
capital market, through financial institutions licensed to operate securities borrowing and lending (SBL) business.
The practice of short selling has increased gradually: in 1999 there were only three securities companies licensed to
operate SBL. Although ISL and GND characterize Thailand as a country where short sales are a common practice,
market regulators were aware of only one transaction since 1997, apart from “mistaken” transactions done by
brokers.

9

There is clearly a difference between what the law allows and what is common practice.
Although short selling is currently legal in most countries, it is only practiced in 28. In some
countries, tax rules make shorting very difficult. In Chile for instance, although short selling and
securities lending have been possible since 1999, they are rarely used because lending is
considered an immediate, taxable sale. Given that there is no sale price, the relevant price is the
highest price of the stock on the day it is lent; if it is higher than the purchase price, capital gains
tax will apply. In Turkey, stock lending is treated as a normal transaction by the tax authorities,
and as such it is liable to capital gains tax where applicable. In Finland, transfer laws also place
a serious burden on this activity. In countries like the Philippines or Turkey, short selling is
allowed, but the rules are not yet clearly defined. In Thailand, evidence of the practice is murky.
Regulators in that country believe that short selling is not practiced because the market for
borrowing stock is very narrow, especially on the supply side, due to the absence of a futures
market.
[Insert Table 1 here]
There are some other features of short–selling practices throughout the world that are
relevant for our purposes. In some markets only the largest and most liquid stocks may be
shorted. Until 1996, Hong Kong only allowed short sales in securities specifically designated by
the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. A similar rule currently operates in Greece. More
objective criteria are found in Poland, where any security with a market capitalization of at least
250 million zloty qualifies. We adopt the convention of classifying Hong Kong as a country
where short selling is allowed only after 1996, even though it was allowed for a subset of stocks
beginning in 1994.6 For Poland and Greece, GNM reports that short selling is not practiced.

6

See footnote 5.

10

We also regard short selling as allowed and practiced in a country even if some investors
are prohibited from entering into these transactions. In Sweden, for example, traders can go
short without having borrowed the shares in advance,7 while individual investors must borrow
the shares before they go short. In Greece prior to 2001, short selling was only available to the
members of the Athens Derivatives Exchange.

Some countries only impose short–sales

restrictions on foreign investors. In Brazil, for instance, a short seller must have a domestic legal
representative. In India, foreign investors are prohibited from short selling. It is fair to say that
for every country in our sample, there exist some constellation of laws, regulations, institutional
norms, variation in practice and fine print governing the ability to take and maintain a short
position in a stock. Our challenge in this paper has been to categorize them in economically
meaningful ways.
Although the actual practice of short selling depends upon laws, regulation, frictions and
costs in markets, we are forced to reduce the complexities to a single dimension for purposes of
analysis. We classify countries in our sample into four groups, depending on whether short
selling is legal and practiced. This classification of course misses the nuances of expenses and
risks that potentially characterize differences in short selling across international markets.
Never-the-less, even this basic simplification yields interesting results. In the first group we
have the countries where short selling became legal some time before 1990, and where short
selling is currently practiced. This group includes the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic,8 Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, and Switzerland. The second
group consists of countries in which short sales were prohibited as of December, 2001. These
7

They must borrow the stock before the end of the day, however.

11

are: Colombia, Greece, Indonesia, Jordan, Pakistan, Peru, Singapore, the Slovak Republic,
South Korea, Taiwan, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. The third group is comprised of countries in
which short selling is allowed but rarely practiced: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Finland, India,
Israel, New Zealand, the Philippines, Poland, Spain,9 and Turkey. Finally, the remaining five
countries—Hong Kong, Norway, Sweden, Malaysia, and Thailand—comprise a group for
which short–sales regulation and practice changed sometime between January, 1990 and
December, 2001.

Equity Market Data and Sources

The international return, volume and issue data for the 47 markets in our study come from
Datastream, and our U.S. data come from CRSP. Prices and returns are measured in local
currency. We construct value-weighted market indices for each country in the sample. It is
important to note that the number of firms per country varies across years, and thus the volatility
of the market index might vary with time as a consequence, since there are typically fewer
constituent firms in the indices for some countries in the earlier years of the sample.10 For this
reason we estimate a year-fixed effects model in most of our statistical analysis.
We obtain accounting data from Worldscope for non-U.S. firms, and Compustat for U.S.
firms. We also obtain country information from the Economist Intelligence Unit database and
from the World Bank. In particular, we characterize each country in our sample by its
geographical size, the GDP per capita, and the variance of GDP growth. Finally, we construct an

V.

Short–Sales Restrictions and the Co-movement of Stock Returns

The first question in our analysis is whether short–sales restrictions play a role in efficient
price discovery. The key implication of Diamond and Verecchia (1987) for example, is that
short–sales constraints impede the market’s ability to rapidly impound value-relevant
information. As the voluminous literature on the efficient market theory suggests, there is no
universal test for relative market efficiency, although event studies and filter rules have a long
history of application. An important recent contribution to the literature on market efficiency is
MYY’s observation that more efficient markets can be expected to have more idiosyncratic risk,
since the ratio of firm-specific information to market-level information is likely to be higher in
informational environments that allow market participants to acquire information and act
quickly and inexpensively upon it. MYY examine international differences in the degree of comovement in stock prices across countries around the world, and find that the ratio of
idiosyncratic risk in relatively developed markets is higher than in markets that are commonly
viewed as less developed—particularly emerging markets. In our analysis, we use the MYY
measure as a proxy for market efficiency, and then test whether cross-sectional differences in
short–sales constraints correlate well to it.

a. Measures of Price Synchronicity
Following MYY, for each country in our sample and for every year, we calculate two aggregate
measures of individual security co-movement.

13

We compute the ratio:

f it =

[

max nitup , nitdown
nit

]

(1)

where nit is the number of stocks in country i and week t, nitup is the number of stocks whose
price rise in week t, and nitdown is the number of stocks whose price fall. We then average the f’s
across countries and years, that is:
δ iT

f iT =

∑ f it

t =1

δ iT

(2)

where δiT is the number of trading weeks in country i and year T. The ratio of stocks moving
together varies between 0.5 and 1, numbers closer to 1 indicate more co-movement. MYY argue
that more co-movement implies less efficient price discovery in the market, since stock specific
information is presumably the driver of any deviation in co-movement among stocks. Thus,
cross-sectional idiosyncratic risk is another potential way to capture this intuition. We thus also
compute the R2 for regressions of the form:

rijt = α ij + β i rmjt + ε ijt

(3)

That is, we regress weekly stock returns on the value-weighted market return, for every firm i
and in every year (where week t belongs to year T). We then average the R2s for each country j
and for every year T, as in MYY:
2

∑ RijT SSTijT

R 2jT = i

(4)
∑ SSTijT
i

where SST is the sum of squares in regression (3).
14

MYY find that developing economies display significantly higher levels of comovement than more developed ones. In particular, they find that co-movement is explained in
the cross-section by the GDP per capita. They provide several hypotheses why this can happen,
and show that, when interacted with an index of good government, the significance of the GDP
per capital disappears.
One potentially important explanation for such a pattern is that smaller countries have
less-diversified stock markets. To address this issue, MYY use country-level and industry-level
Herfindahl indices. The former captures the cross-industry concentration based upon sales, the
latter captures the average within-industry concentration based upon sales.

To see how this

might work, consider some extreme examples: Finland and Norway vs. the U.S. In Finland,
Nokia represents more than 50% of the market capitalization of the Helsinki Stock Exchange. In
terms of domestic sales, the telecommunications giant accounts for 5% of the total sales in the
country, and 19.6% of the sales in its industry. Indeed, Telecom Equipment accounted for
22.82% of the total sales of Finnish companies.
The country-Herfindahl index for Finland is 12.28. This is not dramatically higher than
the a median of 11.02 for all the countries in the sample. The industry-Herfindahl index for
Finland is 8.29 (compared to a median 7.11 for the whole sample). This means that, even though
the telecom industry is highly concentrated, the other industries are not. In contrast, Norway,
has a country-Herfindahl measure of 73, and an industry-Herfindahl measure of 17.82. In this
case it is driven by the natural resources industries that represent the bulk of the industrial
production in Norway. For the U.S., the country-Herfindahl measure is 4.45 in 2001, and the
industry-Herfindahl measure is 2.25%. Thus, Norway has a low cross-sectional dispersion in
firm returns due to its industrial structure, not necessarily because of relative market efficiency,
and the Herfindahl indices appear to be a useful control.

15

In our analysis, we replicate as closely as possible the estimation and control variables
used in MYY, adding a short–sales indicator variable. We construct indices of industry
concentration (by industry and country, as described in their paper), indices of earnings
comovement,11 and calculate the number of listed firms in each country and year. The short–
sales indicator is a dummy variable that equals one whenever short selling is allowed and
practiced in a given country and year, and zero otherwise. If a country changed its regulation in
a given year, we eliminate that observation from the sample. Our final panel with complete data
includes 503 observations. The earnings co-movement index is available for only a subset of
countries. When we use it the number of observations is reduced to 268. We estimate the model
with year–fixed effects and country–fixed effects. We control for several country–and–year
specific factors, such as the GDP per capita, the country and industry Herfindahl indices and the
earnings co-movement index. Whenever country–fixed effects are not used, we additionally
control for time–invariant variables, like the geographical size of the country, the variance in
GDP growth, and the good government index. As in MYY, the dependent variable is
transformed into a continuous variable over the range [-∞,+∞]. We report the results of the
estimation in Table 2.
[Insert Table 2 here]

b. Results
The first panel in Table 2 replicates the MYY results, although our sample is
significantly different in time and cross-section from theirs. Despite these sample differences,
we generally confirm the MYY finding that countries with higher GDP per capita display lower

11

Since we replicate the procedure in MYY, we do not provide details on how these variables are computed.

16

stock price synchronicity.

The only exception is that in our first specification with both

country– and year–fixed effects, the coefficient on log-GDP per capita is positive and
significant. In this case, the GDP per capita must be interpreted strictly in a time–series sense:
stock price co-movement increases in a country as its GDP per capita grows. The economic
interpretation of this positive relationship is not clear, however the sign on GDP becomes
negative as we eliminate either country– or year–fixed effects in other specifications. The good
government index is also statistically significant, with two caveats: (i) the coefficient displays
different signs depending on the specification, and (ii) the GDP per capita does not become
insignificant once the good government index is introduced in the regression. We suspect these
differences are due to the larger cross-section of countries we use in our analysis, but they could
also be due to the fact that there have been secular changes in the residual risk component in
different countries. In recent years, Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel and Xu (2001) for example, note
a dramatic downward shift in residual risk for the U.S. If other countries experienced similar
trends in residual risk, then the cross-sectional correlation to other variables could certainly
change.
The second panel in Table 2 shows that lifting short–sales restrictions is associated with
an increase in the idiosyncratic portion of stock returns. The coefficient on the short–sales
indicator is negative and significant at the 1 percent level or more in each specification. This
result is evidently not driven by country differences. That is, the description of legal regimes in
Section III shows that, in general, more developed markets allow short selling while developing
markets restrict it. However, the short–selling indicator remains significant when we allow for
both year– and country–fixed effects. This is possible because we have inter-temporal changes
in short–sales practices for some countries in our sample. Moreover, the short–sales indicator is

17

significant after controlling for differences in the GDP per capita across countries, and the
number of listed firms.
We perform a similar analysis with the R2s of the regressions of stock returns on market
indices. These results are reported in Table 3. Following MYY, we have transformed the R2s to
map them to the set of real numbers. The short–sales indicator is significant and has a negative
coefficient in all specifications, except when country– and year–fixed effects are estimated. The
differences between Table 2 and Table 3 may be due to the non-parametric nature of the
synchronicity measure. Although it does not capture magnitude differences in residual risk, it is
presumably robust to extreme outliers. Using R2s, the GDP per capita becomes insignificant
once we include the short–sales indicator. However, the good government index is either unable
to eliminate the significance of the GDP per capita, or displays a positive coefficient, which
contradicts the findings of MYY. Only when the earnings co-movement index enters the last
regression in the bottom panel in Table 3 do both the government index and the GDP per capita
become insignificant.
[Insert Table 3 here]
In economic terms, a coefficient of –0.431 for the indicator means that for the average country,
the removal of short–selling restrictions reduces the R2 of the average stock by 27%. In other
words, the idiosyncratic risk of the average stock increases by 27%. As we show, this result is
robust to country differences, different time periods, and institutional differences. An economic
rationale for our findings is provided by Campbell et al. (2001), who observe that the proportion
of idiosyncratic risk in the U.S. has increased significantly in recent years. Despite the analyst
scandals characterizing the post-Enron U.S. market, they suggest the trend towards more
residual risk may result from the increasing availability of value-relevant firm-specific
information which may in turn be impounded into stock prices in a liquid market.

VI.

Short–Sales Restrictions and the Distribution of Stock Returns

In this section we examine the distribution of stock returns conditional upon short–sales
restrictions. We compute statistics for three different series’ for each country. First we construct
weekly stock returns for each firm in our sample with at least 100 daily observations available
in a given year. We also construct time series’ of weekly returns for the corresponding market
indices. Finally, we run, for every year and each firm, regressions specified in equation (3), and
save the residuals from the regression as abnormal firm returns. In a market with many
systematic shocks, firms’ raw returns may primarily reflect systematic shocks and thus the
residual may be of interest. Because equity returns are distributed approximately log-normal, we
transform the three groups of returns into their logarithmic representation, and compute the
skewness, standard deviation, and frequency of extreme returns.
We find weak evidence that supports regulators’ view that short–selling constraints help
prevent financial panics, at least for individual securities. The distribution of individual stock
returns in our sample are less negatively skewed when short–selling is prohibited. There is also
a significantly lower chance of a negative extreme return when short–selling is prohibited. Both
findings offer some support that short–selling regulations prevent extreme negative returns.
However, we find little evidence that short–sales constraints reduce the negative skewness of
market level returns.

A. Skewness
Hong and Stein (2002) develop a model in which investors possess different information
about the value of a stock. Investors with negative information cannot always use it due to

19

short–sale constraints. They would be willing to sell the stock to high–valuation investors, but
they do not necessarily own it. The Hong and Stein model provides a rationale for why stock
returns display negative skewness. Their paper predicts that elevated trading volume should be
associated with increased negative skewness. Indeed, in the accompanying empirical study,
Chen et al. (2002) test the proposition that abnormal turnover is a predictor of negative
skewness. They find consistent evidence on a sample of NYSE and AMEX stocks for the period
July, 1962 to December, 1998: at the firm level, changes in turnover predict future negative
skewness.
A reasonable implication of the Hong and Stein model is that whenever short–selling
restrictions are removed, skewness should be become less negative. Our objective in this section
is to test this proposition.

Given that skewness is almost certainly affected by country– and

time–specific effects, we perform a cross-sectional analysis that controls for these factors. In
addition to the country-specific controls, we follow Chen et al. (2001), who find that the detrended turnover and past market returns are predictors of skewness. We construct the average
de-trended turnover for the countries in our sample as follows. We first calculate the de-trended
volume by firm, by subtracting the previous-year volume from the current volume.12 We then
calculate the sum of de-trended volumes for all firms in a given country and year, and divide by
the total number of shares outstanding for all the firms in the country with available data on
volume.13
Results from the estimation are in Table 4. Interestingly, we find that short–sales
restrictions are associated with less negative, not more negative skewness. The short–sales
indicator explains the skewness of raw and market-adjusted individual stock returns. However
12

Note that we lose one year of observations for every firm.
We try an alternative specification that consists of calculating the market turnover first, and then de-trending it.
This methodology, similar to Chen et al. (2001), provides qualitatively similar results.

13

20

the evidence for the market itself in each country is insignificant once control variables like size
are added.14 We also find that, without controlling for short–sales restrictions, less developed
countries, i.e. those with lower GDP per capita, have more positively skewed returns. However,
the significance of the coefficient disappears once we control for short selling.
[Insert Table 4 here]
In sum, for markets in which short selling is either prohibited or not practiced, there is
no evidence that returns display significantly less negative skewness at the individual stock
level. However, at the market level, where the welfare effects are greatest and where regulators
expect short–sales to reduce crashes, it makes little difference whether short sales are allowed
and practiced, once we control for macroeconomic factors.
In addition to these results we find some evidence consistent with the theoretical model
in Hong and Stein (2002) in that differences of opinion, proxied by the lagged de-trended
turnover, predict more negative skewness. We also find weak evidence that lagged market
returns help predict negative skewness. The coefficient on lagged market returns is negative
and significant only when the dependent variable is the skewness of raw returns.

B. Volatility of Returns
In Table 5 we study the effect of short–sales restrictions on the volatility of individual
stock returns. We calculate the average standard deviation of individual stock returns, and use
its logarithm as endogenous variable in the regressions, hence it can take any real value. As
usual, we employ country– and time–specific variables
[Insert Table 5 here]
14

In a specification that does not control for year and GDP effects we find a significant association between short-

21

The coefficient for the short–sales indicator is always negative and significant at the 1
percent level—consistent with the association of short–sales restrictions and higher return
volatility—except for the case in which we use country– and year–fixed effects. Returns are
more volatile in less developed countries, but the significance of the result disappears once we
control for the good government index. In that regard, better–governed countries display lower
return volatility. Returns are also less volatile in countries with less volatile fundamentals—
measured by the variance in GDP growth and the earnings co-movement index. In general, our
analysis of the cross-sectional differences in the volatility of returns conditional upon short–
selling restrictions should be considered in light of the potential that any association uncovered
between the two might be driven by reverse causality. Riskier markets in general are more
likely to pose concerns for regulators whose goals presumably include investor protection.

C. Crashes
C.1. Sample of All Countries
Arguably the most important rationale for short–sales restrictions is that short selling is
responsible for recent market crashes in the world financial market—particularly the 1987
market crash and the 1997 Asian crisis. Our objective in this section is to evaluate the empirical
evidence for such a view.
The main difficulty in estimating the probability and severity of a market crash
conditional upon the existence of short–sales restrictions is the Peso problem: we only have data
on realized crashes. One alternative is to measure the extent of market drops during crisis events
depending upon the existence of short–selling restrictions. However, this would not answer the

sales restrictions and a reduction in negative market skewness. We do not report these results in a table.

22

question of whether crashes are more likely in the presence of short–sellers. If we believe
market regulators, short selling may not trigger a crash, but simply make it more severe.
We therefore calculate the number of days in our sample period in which stock returns
are below two standard deviations from their previous year average. We divide this number by
the total number of trading days, and then compute the frequency of extreme returns. Under the
assumption that returns are log-normally distributed, the percentage should equal 2.5 percent.
[Insert Table 6 here]
In Table 6 we regress the frequency of extreme results on a set of explanatory variables.
We do not include the number of listed firms as an explanatory variable because the
denominator in the frequency calculation is the number of trading days per year times the
number of listed firms in a given country and year. Therefore, there is an almost exact linear
relationship between a log transformation of the frequency of extreme events, and the log of the
number of listed firms.
In Table 6, short–sales restrictions are only weakly and insignificantly associated with
more frequent extreme negative returns. None of the explanatory variables, except for the short–
sales indicator, display a positive coefficient. There is only once specification for which we
reject the null. This is the case in which we use a sub-sample of country–years for which we
have data on earnings co-movement. The evidence from this table suggests that the probability
of extreme negative returns is not likely to be a function of short-sales practices in countries,
but rather determined by other non–specified, country–specific factors.

23

C.2. Countries with Regulatory Changes
To shed some light on the relationship between short–sales constraints and extreme
returns, and in order to eliminate a number of the potential cross-sectional differences that might
explain the results thus far, we restrict our attention to the sub-set of countries that changed
regulations over the period 1990–2001. Essentially this should allow a good hedonic control,
country by country, at least under the assumption that the regulatory change is not triggered by
shifts in other characteristics. These countries are Hong Kong, Norway, Sweden, Malaysia, and
Thailand. In the case of Hong Kong, Norway, Sweden, and Thailand, short–selling restrictions
were removed in a specific year (not the same calendar year for each country). In Malaysia—as
we detail in section III—short selling was allowed only for the period 1995–1997, and was then
prohibited again in 1997 at the onset of the Asian financial crises.
[Insert Table 8 here]
Table 8 reports the frequency of extreme events for the five countries, around the year in
which short sales become effective. We calculate the average by year-to-event,15 and find that,
on average, the frequency of extreme returns is 3.69 percent one year after restrictions are lifted.
In some years, however, extreme returns are too frequent (7.28 percent year t+5, 7.10 percent in
year t+6). In Norway, Malaysia, and Hong Kong, extreme returns are more frequent in all but
one of the periods, compared to period t-1, in which short sales are allowed. In Sweden, the
frequency of extreme results is higher after 1991 than in 1990, one year before the lifting of
short–selling restrictions. However, in Thailand the effect of short sales is a reduction of the
percentage of extreme returns, compared to the pre-1997 period. It therefore seems that the
effect of short sales on crashes may be somewhat country–specific.

15

Malaysia is not included in years after t+2, because short sales were prohibited again in 1997.

24

Cross-sectional regression results using yearly information for the aforementioned five
countries are reported in Table 8. We employ the same controls in these regressions as in
previous sections. The power of the results declines substantially as expected, since we have
only 45 observations. Unlike the previous estimates, we find that the frequency of extreme
declines is marginally associated with relaxation of short–sales constraints. The coefficient on
the short–sales indicator is significant at the 10 percent level in two of the specifications when
we do not use country–fixed effects. It also has a time–series interpretation. The lifting of
short–sales restrictions results in an average increase in the frequency of extreme returns. When
we estimate the regression with country– and year– fixed effects (the first model), we find some
support for the hypothesis that short sales increase the probability of a crisis. We certainly find
no evidence in favor of a positive relationship between short–sales restrictions and severity of
market crashes.
[Insert Table 8 here]

D. Kernel Estimation of Return Distributions
Thus far, we have looked at various statistics of conditional distributions. It is instructive,
however, to look at the return densities themselves. We perform a kernel estimation of a density
functions of stock returns with and without short–sales constraints that fits the distribution of
returns.16 The advantage of the kernel estimation is that we do not need to constrain the
distribution to be normal, or even symmetric.

16

The general form of the kernel density estimator is:

1 n  x − xi 
fˆλ ( x) =

∑ N
nλ i =1  λ 

25

[Insert Figure 2 here]
We estimate the kernel density for the market returns, both for the total sample and for
the sub-sample of countries with regulatory changes. Figure 2 plots the histograms of returns, as
well as the densities, depending on the existence of short–selling restrictions. Confirming the
results in Table 4, Figure 2 shows that (i) the distribution of returns is more leptokurtotic when
short sales are allowed and practiced.; and (ii) the distribution of returns is not symmetric.
Conclusions
Restrictions on short selling of shares are nearly as old as stock markets themselves.
Critics often view short–sales as immoral—the exploitation of others’ misfortune and an
exacerbating factor in periods of market crisis. As recently as the Asian currency crisis of 1997,
short–sellers were blamed by politicians and journalists for helping to destroy the “Asian
Miracle.” In the current environment with the growth of hedge funds, concerns about the danger
of allowing speculation frequently surface. There is at least some common suspicion that short
selling can exacerbate market crashes. Most academic researchers, however, make a strong
theoretical case for allowing short–sales in markets. Their case is based upon the notion that
markets exist to facilitate the efficient pricing of assets, and that restricting short–sales reduces

sample size, and xi is the ith observation. The kernel density minimizes the mean integrated squared error ηλ:

market efficiency. Recent empirical evidence by researchers, particularly Jones and Lamont
(2001) provides some support for the hypothesis that difficulty in short selling is associated with
security mispricing. In this paper, we survey short–selling regulations and practices for major
stock markets around the world. We find empirical evidence in support of both views. Using a
market efficiency measure developed by Mørck et al (2000), we find a negative association
between short–sales restrictions and the diffusion of value-relevant information into prices. Our
analysis of the statistical characteristics of markets, specifically the standard deviation and
skewness of log returns, suggests that short–sales restrictions are more common in highvolatility countries, but that the restrictions are also weakly associated with less negative
skewness in individual stock returns.

Comments

Securities lending is not specifically prohibited or provided for under current regulations. Free transfers of securities between different beneficial owners
cannot be done without executing a trade on the exchange. Off-shore lending is generally not practiced.

Table 1. Short Selling Restrictions Around the World
For each country in the sample, the table describes the date where short selling was allowed if this happened on or after 1990.
Otherwise countries are classified as ‘Allowed Before 1990’, or ‘Not Allowed’. Securities Lending refers to the ability of an
investor to borrow securities from another party. Short Selling refers to the ability of an investor to sell a borrowed security to a
third party. Short Selling is practiced when there are indications from market participants, market regulators, or institutions
within a country, that short selling is a common practice. Data is obtained from the Global Network Management Division at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the International Securities Lending at Goldman Sachs, the corresponding market regulators, the
International Securities Services Association Handbook, and practitioners listed in the Worldwide Directory of Securities
Lending and Repo.

Table 2. Comovement of Stocks: Proportion of Stocks moving together
The dependent variable is the proportion of stocks moving together in each country and year. For each day, we compute the maximum of the number of stocks with positive returns,
and the number of stocks with negative returns, relative to the total number of stocks. We then calculate the average of this ratio for each country and year. The number of firms is
the number of firms with available stock price data in Datastream, in each country and year. Country Herfindahl index is calculated as the sum of the market shares (squared) of
every firm in each country and year, relative to the corresponding country's total sales. Industry Herfindahl index is calculated as the sum of the market shares (squared) of every
industry in each country and year, relative to the corresponding country's total sales. The size of the country is the extension of a country in square kilometers, from
www.yahoo.com. The earnings comovement index is calculated as in Morck et al. (2000). The Good Government index is the sum of the Risk of Expropriation, Corruption, and
Repudiation of Contract indices from La Porta et al. (1997). The Short Selling variable is a dummy variable that equals one when short selling is allowed and practiced in a given
country and year, zero otherwise. The sample includes firms from 52 countries with stock price information available from Datastream. Macroeconomic variables are from the
Economist Intelligence Unit database. All regressions include year-fixed effects. Standard errors are White-heteroskedasticity consistent.

Table 4. Short Selling Restrictions and Skewness of Stock Returns
The dependent variable is the skewness of log(1+r), where r denotes stock returns in each country and year. The skewness of raw returns is calculated as the skewness of the total sample of weekly stock
returns in each country and year. The skewness of abnormal returns is the skewness of log(1+u), where u is the residual of a regression of weekly stock returns on the market index, for each firm in every
country and year. The skewness of the market return is the skewness of the value-weighted market index return, in each country and year. The number of firms is the number of firms with available stock
price data in Datastream, in each country and year. Country Herfindahl index is calculated as the sum of the market shares (squared) of every firm in each country and year, relative to the corresponding
country's total sales. Industry Herfindahl index is calculated as the sum of the market shares (squared) of every industry in each country and year, relative to the corresponding country's total sales. The
size of the country is the extension of a country in square kilometers, from www.yahoo.com. The earnings comovement index is calculated as in Morck et al. (2000). The Good Government index is the
sum of the Risk of Expropriation, Corruption, and Repudiation of Contract indices from La Porta et al. (1997). The Short Selling variable is a dummy variable that equals one when short selling is allowed
and practiced in a given country and year, zero otherwise. The sample includes firms from 52 countries with stock price information available from Datastream. Macroeconomic variables are from the
Economist Intelligence Unit database. All regressions include year-fixed effects. Standard errors are White-heteroskedasticity consistent.

Table 5. Distribution of Stock Returns and Short-Selling Restrictions
The dependent variable is the standard deviation of individual stock returns, averaged across countries and years. The number of firms is the number of firms with available stock
price data in Datastream, in each country and year. Country Herfindahl index is calculated as the sum of the market shares (squared) of every firm in each country and year, relative
to the corresponding country's total sales. Industry Herfindahl index is calculated as the sum of the market shares (squared) of every industry in each country and year, relative to the
corresponding country's total sales. The size of the country is the extension of a country in square kilometers, from www.yahoo.com. The earnings comovement index is calculated
as in Morck et al. (2000). The Good Government index is the sum of the Risk of Expropriation, Corruption, and Repudiation of Contract indices from La Porta et al. (1997). The
Short Selling variable is a dummy variable that equals one when short selling is allowed and practiced in a given country and year, zero otherwise. The sample includes firms from
52 countries with stock price information available from Datastream. Macroeconomic variables are from the Economist Intelligence Unit database. All regressions include yearfixed effects. Standard errors are White-heteroskedasticity consistent.

Table 6. Frequency of Extreme Returns and Short-Selling Restrictions
The dependent variables is the per year number of trading days where the market return is lower than the average market return minus two standard deviations, divided by the total
number of trading days. The endogenous variable is mapped on the set of real numbers, with the transformation log(x/(1-x)). The mean and standard deviation of the market return is
calculated over the same country and year. Country Herfindahl index is calculated as the sum of the market shares (squared) of every firm in each country and year, relative to the
corresponding country's total sales. Industry Herfindahl index is calculated as the sum of the market shares (squared) of every industry in each country and year, relative to the

Table 7. Frequency of Extreme Returns and Short-Selling Restrictions. Countries with Regulatory
changes only
Number of trading days where the market return is lower than the average market return minus
two standard deviations, divided by the total number of trading days, around the elimination of
short selling restrictions. Only the five countries with regulatory changes between 1990 and
2001–Hong Kong, Norway, Sweden, Malaysia, and Thailand–are considered. The sample
includes firms from these countries with stock price information available from Datastream. For
each firm and year, we calculate the mean and standard deviation of returns, and calculate the
number of days where the return is below the average return, minus two standard deviation. We
aggregate this number by country and year, and divide by the total number of firm-days in the
year with available stock price information.

Figure 1. Comovement of Stock Returns and Short Sales Restrictions
Proportion of Stocks Comoving together agains skewness of market returns. For each day, we compute the maximum
of the number of stocks with positive returns, and the number of stocks with negative returns, relative to the total
number of stocks. We then calculate the average of this ratio for each country and year. Countries are classified
depending on whether short sales are allowed and practiced (boxes), or not (crosses). The sample includes firms from
52 countries with stock price information available from Datastream.

variable is a dummy variable that equals one when short selling is allowed and practiced in a given country
and year, zero otherwise. The sample includes firms from 52 countries with stock price information
available from Datastream. Returns are pooled across years. The first two graphs corresponds to all the
countries in the sample. The last to figures consider only the countries that have changed their regulation
during the sample period–Hong Kong, Malaysia, Norway, Sweden, and Thailand.
