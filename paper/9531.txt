Freight Rates and Productivity Gains in British Tramp Shipping 1869-1950

NBER Working Paper No. 9531

JEL No. F1, N7, O3
ABSTRACT
The standard source for pre-WWII global freight rate trends is the Isserlis British tramp
shipping index. We think it is flawed, and that its sources offer vastly more information than the
Isserlis aggregate contains. The new data confirm the precipitous decline in nominal freight rates
before the World War I, but it also extends the series to the 1940s. Furthermore, our new series is
linked to the post-World War II era (documented by David Hummels), so that we can be more
precise about what has happened over the very long run. We also create route-specific deflators by
using the prices of commodities transported. Previous scholars have deflated their nominal freight
rate indices by a price index that includes tradables not carried on all routes and non-tradables not
carried on any route. Our deflated indices offer a more effective measure of the contribution of
declining freight rates to commodity-price convergence across trading regions. Using the pricedual
method and new indices for factor prices, we then calculate total factor productivity growth pre-war
and interwar for five global routes. Finally, we identify the sources of the total factor productivity
growth.

I. Introduction

The period between 1850 and the First World War saw increasingly integrated global
commodity markets. Economists commonly use the trade-to-GDP share to demonstrate this trend
(Maddison 1995), but this index can be very misleading. After all, outward shifts in import
demand or export supply can also lead to trade expansion even in an anti-global policy
environment. A better measure is the narrowing of price differentials between markets. That prewar agricultural and non-agricultural prices did indeed converge within Atlantic markets, within
non-Atlantic markets, and between them has been shown in a number of recent works (Harley
1980; O’Rourke and Williamson 1999; Williamson 2002; Findlay and O’Rourke 2002). While
integration was hindered by tariff barriers, world markets were far better integrated just before the
First World War than ever before.
Economists have mistakenly concentrated on trade policy to explain this globalization
trend prior to the First World War. Albert Imlah (1958), for example, started his account of Pax
Britannica by attributing the world trade boom to British leadership in adopting a liberal trade
policy, and historical accounts have always laid great emphasis on the repeal of the Corn Laws in
1846. Indeed, that date has often been designated as a marker for the beginning of a free trade
movement as liberal trade policies spread across Europe. However, the movement met resistance
after the 1870s as countries on the Continent retreated from openness, and tariffs were raised to
far higher levels in the European periphery, Latin America and the rich English-speaking
offshoots (Coatsworth and Williamson 2002). Bairoch (1989: pp. 55-8) and others have shown
that the rise in European tariffs was a defensive response to competition in local markets
increasingly integrated into world markets by a fall in transport costs on land due to railroads and
on sea due to shipping.

This paper focuses on the developments in the British tramp shipping industry up to the
Second World War. There is already enough published material to show that freight rates
declined precipitously before the First World War (Isserlis 1938; North 1958, 1965, 1968;
Stemmer 1989; Harley 1980, 1988, 1989; Fischer and Nordvik 1986; Yasuba 1978). This paper
fills in some of the gaps from a well-known source (Angiers) that has been incompletely mined. It
also replaces the famous but, we think, flawed Isserlis (1938) global tramp shipping index, the
standard source on global freight rate trends. In addition, the paper also fills a gap in the shipping
literature for the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, decades that saw policy-induced de-globalization.
Finally, our global index is linked to that of David Hummels (1999) on shipping freights in the
post-World War II era, so that we can say something about the very long run.
We also create route-specific deflators by using the prices of commodities transported on
the route. Previous scholars have deflated their nominal freight rate indices by the SauerbeckStatist British price index, an index that includes tradables not carried on all routes and nontradables not carried on any route. Our deflated indices offer a more effective measure of the
contribution of declining freight rates to commodity-price convergence across trading regions.
The first half of this paper documents our new freight rate indices for the period between
1869 and 1950. The second half explores the sources of that decline. This is a debate with an
impressive pedigree. Douglass North’s (1958, 1968) productivity gains calculations in shipping
surprisingly revealed that larger productivity gains took place before the introduction of the major
shipping innovations of the 19th century. North thus concluded that improvements in management
and industrial organization drove the fall in freight rates, and that technological change was only
secondary. Knick Harley (1988) challenged this long-accepted view by showing that there were
significant problems with the North freight rate index. Basically, the early part of the 19th century
saw a sharp decline in the stowage factor (i.e. space occupied per ton) of cotton. The packing of
cotton bales improved considerably with the introduction of the screw press followed by the
steam press, both allowing more cotton to be crammed into holds (Harley 1988: pp. 856-9). This

-2-

led to a steep fall in cotton freight rates in the first half of the 19th century. Since North’s freight
rate index was heavily weighted by cotton, it did not represent general shipping trends.
Conducting a productivity gains calculation on a revised index, Harley concluded that the more
significant productivity gains took place after 1869, and were attributable to the introduction of
the steam engine and improvements in hull technology. The conventional history was reclaimed.
While Harley appeared to have settled one debate,1 he created another by noting that the
shipping industry was marked by joint-production on different legs of journeys (Harley 1985;
1988; 1989; 1990). Calculating TFP gains without taking into account joint-production could lead
to a significant measurement bias the size and direction of which would depend on the shipping
route. After analyzing the joint-production issue, we revisit Harley’s measurement of TFP gains
between 1870 and 1896. Using the price-dual method and new indices for factor prices, we
calculate productivity gains for this period anew, not only for the Bombay-UK route examined by
Harley but also for four other routes. We then move on to calculate TFP growth for the period
between the early 1890s and the First World War, as well as that between the two World Wars,
the latter having received relatively little attention in the shipping literature.2 Finally, we explore
the sources of that productivity experience.

1

Harley has not been alone. Yasukichi Yasuba (1978) calculated productivity gains in Japanese pre-WWII
tramp and liner shipping using quantities of outputs and inputs, and Walter Knauerhause (1968) did the
same for labor productivity on German liners in the 1870s and 1880s.
2
Data limitations force us to restrict our calculations to the British tramp shipping industry, almost entirely
ignoring the liner shipping industry. Liners, unlike tramps, operate on fixed time schedules on fixed routes.
Tramps are hired to carry either restricted (i.e. specified in the contract) or unrestricted cargoes between
negotiated ports, and unless a fixed time charter is negotiated, no time schedule or route is fixed. Tramp
shipping dominated trade in commodities. In 1909, a Royal commission found that tramps made up 7080% of total tonnage, so that liners could not have been more than one-third of the total (Pollard and
Robertson 1979: p. 20). Liners did not operate on full capacity, and carried high value articles that were
less bulky. Tramps carried the high bulk, low value staples.

II. Freight Rate Indices

The Need for New Indices
It is surprising that the Isserlis global freight rate index has remained the standard source
on global freight rates for 1869-1936 given that its construction is flawed. The flaws are more
than those pointed out by Yasukichi Yasuba who argued that there is an upward bias in the
Isserlis index since “declining rates were quoted only after the number of contracts reaches a
certain level, and rising rates for the old established routes tend to remain in the list longer than
they deserve” (Yasuba 1978: p. 13). Isserlis took his data from Angier’s annual reports on British
shipping, and it is true that Angier’s choice of which freight rates to report was somewhat ad hoc.
The more troubling problem with the Isserlis index, however, lies with the way the data were
aggregated3 and with the deflator used to convert from nominal rates. We think it is time to return
to Isserlis’ original source and reconstruct the global index.

The Angier Data
Isserlis reports in an appendix the ratio of the simple average of the highest and lowest
freight rates for a commodity-route in that year to the same average for that commodity-route in
the immediately previous year. This ratio is not available for all routes and for all years, and the
number of gaps in the Isserlis data far outnumber the number of observations. In fact, for almost
every commodity-route, it is impossible to judge the level of freight rates relative to 1869. To do
so, we would need the nominal freight rates themselves, and while they are not in Isserlis, they
can be found in Isserlis’ sources. The Angier annual reports included tables of highest and lowest
British tramp shipping freight rates for various commodity-routes, and these were compiled in
3

Isserlis used Angier’s data to form the ratio of the freight rate on each commodity-route to the freight rate
on that commodity-route in the immediately previous year. He then took the arithmetic average of all
available freight rate ratios for each pair of years, using them to form his global freight chain index. He

Fifty Year Freights (Angier 1920). From the 1880s onwards, they were published annually in a
January edition of Fairplay magazine, a leading British shipping journal. While Isserlis stops
with 1936, the Angier-based freight index can be extended to 1950, which we do in this paper.
Furthermore, while the Angier reports end there, Fairplay included its own reports on tramp
shipping, at least until 1962. These data make it possible to link our index to the modern era
(Hummels 1999).
Mining these sources, we were able to find freight rates for over 500 commodity-routes
from all over the world, but mostly for trade between Europe and the rest of the world, on both
homeward and outbound routes. True to the nature of tramp shipping, the freight rates reported
are for low-value bulk commodities. Most of the rates were reported in shillings/pence per ton.4
Nowhere does Angier make clear why he decided to report certain commodity-routes,
though in some cases he does mention that not enough charter parties were reported to him to be
able to note the highest and lowest freight rates for the year. We are left to guess that Angier
reported only the commodity-routes he thought were important to British tramp shipping.
Finally, we note what Angier almost entirely left out: the short range trade between
Britain and continental Europe, and shipping between non-European ports. Thus, we cannot be
certain that any index based upon this database is representative of global shipping. At best, the
index documents trends in freight rates on bulk commodities between the European center and the
periphery.

rebased this chain index in a single year, 1869. There are significant problems with this method of
construction. See Appendix 1.
4
There are over 8,000 observations. For some commodities, freight rates were reported per 40 cubic feet,
though in early years, their freight rates were reported per ton. Where freight rates were not reported per
ton, we were able to turn to sources on stowage factors (i.e., the space occupied per ton) from the period to
standardize these freight rates. For some commodity-routes (particularly Black Sea grain routes, Newcastle
coal routes in the early years, or the timber routes, freight rates were reported in region-specific or tradespecific unites. These too were standardized by combing through Angier’s reports, the contemporary
shipping literature, and the Oxford dictionary.

Construction of the New Indices
Given that the commodity-routes included in Angier keep changing, and that the series
have intermittent gaps, it is impossible to aggregate these data directly to form an index of long
distance tramp shipping freight rates, but an indirect strategy seems to work: construct indices for
outbound and homeward trade between Europe and individual regions, and then aggregate these
indices into a final “global” index. These route indices are, of course, themselves useful for
analyzing the development of trade between various parts of the periphery and Europe.
Before describing the construction of these route indices, we need to say a word about a
technological constraint that must be taken into account in the construction of our freight indices.
Harley (1990: pp. 157-8) describes this best:
“Ships float by displacing water. Seawater weighs sixty-four pounds per cubic foot or
displaces thirty-five cubic feet per ton. Since the ship itself has some weight, cargoes
such as coal and heavy grain (wheat, rye and corn), which occupy forty cubic feet per
ton, simultaneously fill up a ship and exhaust its buoyancy. Light cargoes, such as cotton,
tend to leave a ship with excess buoyancy for optimal navigation. Consequently, a ship
carrying primarily cotton will be willing to take heavy cargoes at low rates. Alternatively,
a heavy cargo such as iron or ore will exhaust a ship’s buoyancy while it still has empty
space. If this is the primary cargo, then light cargo will be sought to fill available space,
and low rates will be offered.”
Thus, freight rates for commodities with different stowage factors behaved very differently, and
they responded very differently to changes in shipping technology. Because the tramp shipping
industry was competitive and because the time charter party was part of it (e.g. shippers could
take any commodity the ship would carry), freight rates for commodities with similar stowage
factors behaved similarly. Thus, we construct our regional indices from commodities with similar
stowage factors.

-6-

Our global index of long distance tramp freight rates between Europe and the rest of the
world is constructed weighting the different regional indices according to the importance of trade
to and from that region. We use the Board of Trade data (taken from Mitchell 1992) to compute
the ratio of trade to Britain being carried to the individual regions to the total trade carried to all
the regions in the database. These ratios formed the weights for the homeward routes. Outbound
coal freight indices for the various routes were weighted by the ratio of coal carried to these
regions to the total for all the regions in the database. The results are plotted in Figures 1A and
1B.5

Nominal Freight Rate Indices

The new freight rate indices confirm what has long been known about pre-First World
War shipping costs: nominal freight rates declined along all routes. In the interwar period,
however, freight rates recovered their low pre-war levels only in the mid-1930s, for reasons that
will be explored in the next section. Replacing the Isserlis index with our new Global Index
makes a difference. The new index (Figures 1A and 1B) falls faster than the Isserlis index before
and after 1884, suggesting that Isserlis understated the fall in freight rates. After the War, Isserlis
again understates the fall in global tramp freights.
Important differences in the behavior of tramp freights in different regions emerge when
the regional freight rate indices are examined. The Atlantic routes exhibit a wide variety across
different regions and commodities. Timber freights on the eastern North America and Baltic
routes fell much more slowly than did grain freights on the same routes before the First World
War. This is to be expected because of joint-production. Timber did not exhaust both buoyancy
and space, and thus could not take advantage of the increases in ship sizes that were to drive
5

Details on the construction of the route and “global” indices are supplied in Appendix 2.

productivity gains before the War. On the other hand, freight rates on ore carried from the
western Mediterranean, heavier than grain, fell as fast as rates for transatlantic grain cargoes.
Freight rates on grain from the Gulf Coast of North America (GNA) and the East Coast of North
America (ENA) seem to have followed each other closely, at least between 1884 and 1913,
falling by about 25-40% in this period. The fall in grain freights from ENA was slightly sharper
than that for GNA in this period. Baltic and ENA rates both fell by about 40% between 1874 and
1884, though Baltic freights fell more slowly thereafter. Freight rates for grain from East Coast of
Latin America (ELA) fell much slower than for either of these regions between 1869 and 1884,
barely dropping by 10% in this period. Between 1884 and 1913, however, the ELA grain index
matches the performance of GNA and ENA grain freight indices in this period. Freight rate series
for the west coast of North America (WLA: grain) and Latin America (WLA: nitrates) are also
presented in Table 1. These routes were dominated by sailing vessels. Rates fell steeply for the
WNA grain route before 1884. For WLA, however, freight rates fall only after 1884.
The behavior of Latin American freights cannot be explained by the diffusion of new
shipping technologies or distance. WLA, for example, was closer to Europe than WNA, and yet
rates fell faster for the latter route. Harley (1989: p. 327) remarks upon the complexity of the
relationship between outbound and inbound freights in Latin America. The next section examines
how freight rates on various legs of voyages were not determined independently. Demand for
inbound and outbound shipping fluctuated erratically for Latin America. Before 1884, coal
freights for the East Coast of Latin America were falling quicker than freights for coal carried to
most other regions (Table 1). Coal freights for ELA were certainly falling much faster than
outbound grain freights. The explanation for the behavior of Latin American freights likely lies
with shipping demand in these regions.

The First World War saw freight rates peak for the Atlantic routes. They fell only slowly
in the interwar period. It was only around 1933/4 that nominal freight rates fell to their pre-war
levels, but they rose again with the onset of the Second World War.
Coal freight rates (Table 1) do not seem to have been correlated with distance either.
Bombay coal freights, for example, fell much faster than Colombo coal freight rates before 1884,
even though Colombo was only slightly farther away from Britain than Bombay. Outbound coal
freights from Britain seem to have fallen drastically in the interwar period, unlike homeward
freight rates.
Homeward freight rates for non-Atlantic routes (Table 2) fell precipitously between 1869
and 1884. Particularly noteworthy were grain freights from Black Sea ports, that fell by over
60%. Freight rates for western Indian and Bay of Bengal ports fell by over 40% in this period.
Unlike timber on the Atlantic routes, freight rates on lighter commodities that did not exhaust
both buoyancy and space actually fared better that freight rates for commodities with stowage
factors similar to grain. Freight indices for lighter cargoes such as jute transported from the Bay
of Bengal fell by over 65%, although it is unclear how much of this fall was actually caused by
better packing. For Southeast Asia, where the diffusion of steam technology in shipping was
slower because of distance, freight rates fell much more slowly than for India. After 1884,
however, the freight indices for these routes mirror each other for similar types of commodities.
Freight rates fell by up to 25% before the First World War. As in the Atlantic homeward routes,
freight rates fell gradually from their wartime heights in the interwar period.

Real Freight Rate Indices

In order to deflate these nominal indices, we, like other scholars, turn first to the
Sauerbeck index. But the Sauerbeck index is imperfect for our purposes since it includes nontradables and many tradables not carried on all routes. As an alternative, we constructed route-

-9-

specific deflators by taking the unweighted average of the prices of the commodities included in
the commodity-routes. Both our preferred real indices and the Sauerbeck deflated indices are
discussed in Appendix 3.
Figures 2A and 2B illustrate the impact of the deflators by plotting both for two cases: the
American wheat trade and the Calcutta jute trade. The Calcutta nominal freight rate index
deflated by jute prices fell faster after 1873 than the same index deflated by Sauerbeck. Deflating
by Sauerbeck thus understates the fall in real transport costs. The difference is less pronounced in
the ENA-grain route, perhaps because wheat prices get a large weight in the Sauerbeck index.

Extending the Global Index to 1997

Looking at the modern era, David Hummels (1999) reports the Norwegian Shipping
News global freight rate index for tramp charters starting in 1947. Figure 3 and Table 3 use this to
link our series with that of Hummels, making it possible to plot global nominal freight rates for
the 127-year period between 1870 and 1997.6 The nominal freight rates seem to trace out a Ushaped pattern: while the pre-World War I decades saw a continuous fall in nominal freight rates,
the trend was reversed during the war years; and while the pre-war nominal freight rates were
briefly recovered by the middle of the great depression, they have traced out a trend rise ever
since. However, these nominal series need to be deflated by commodity prices. We do so in
Figure 4 where the trend in real tramp freight rates is documented for over the 127-years. The
period between 1870 and 1914 saw an almost uninterrupted fall in shipping costs relative to the
prices of the commodities carried along almost all routes; the war and interwar years were ones of
great instability and little downward trend; and the half century since were years of stability and
no downward trend.

Appendix 2 explains exactly how these indices are linked.

- 10 -

Hummels (1999: p. 12) blames the post-World War II increase in nominal freight rates on
the rise in factor prices. The sharp rise in the 1970s (Figure 3) was, no doubt, related to the
dramatic quadrupling in oil prices at that time, but other major inputs also recorded a 10-30%
rise. A 1977 UNCTAD report claimed that even port costs were rising due to mushrooming labor
costs and other cost pressures (Hummels 1999: p. 13). Of course, tramp shipping had to deal with
rising input costs before 1950 too, and the real indices in Figure 4 are, after all, deflated by
commodity prices. The key, therefore, to long run trends in freight rates was and is total factor
productivity growth. Any retardation in the fall in freight rates plotted in Figure 4 must reflect a
slow down in the rate of productivity advance.

III. Total Factor Productivity Growth

The Problem of Joint Production

The assumption of long run Marshallian competitive equilibrium, whereby the average
freight charge is equal to the average cost of the journey, allowed North to write total factor
productivity growth as
A*

= Pi* – Pf* = Q* – Qi*

(3.1)

where A is total factor productivity, Pi is an index of factor prices weighted by factor shares, Pf is
the freight rate index, Q is the quantity index of outputs (i.e. amount of goods carried), and Qi is
an index of the quantities of various inputs weighted by factor input shares, and the * superscript
denotes rates of change.
North’s assumption is not unreasonable, given the competitive nature of tramp shipping.
The fact that shipping and ship building were relatively small players in the markets for labor,
capital, metal and machinery also supports the assumption that factor prices were exogenous to
this industry. However, and following Harley’s suggestions (1988; 1985; 1989; 1990), we depart

- 11 -

from North’s assumption that joint production along outward and homeward routes did not
matter. Since freight rates carried on each leg were often interdependent, average freight rates did
not always equal average total costs on individual legs of journeys. Productivity gains calculated
only on a single leg are likely, therefore, to be incorrect.
The existence of shipping capacity in one direction automatically creates shipping
capacity in the other since ships have to return to their homeports for repairs and to return their
crews. The simplest case is where demand and marginal cost are the same on both legs. Given the
competitive conditions of the tramp shipping industry on any route,
Ph = MCh = ATCh

(3.2)

Po = MCo = ATCo

(3.3)

where P is the freight rate, MC is the marginal cost of undertaking the voyage, ATC is the
average total cost for each unit space or weight of the carried good, h denotes the homeward
journey, and o the outbound journey. It is not necessarily true that the more full the ship, the
lower the average total cost. Filling a ship beyond a certain level may undermine stability or
increase the average fuel cost, and this level may be defined as full capacity. Of course, in
competitive equilibrium, ships would be filled to this full capacity. Given all of these
assumptions, freight rates in both directions would be equal, and to the marginal cost along each
leg.
Now suppose that the demand for shipping in the two directions is different, as would be
the marginal costs of the voyage. In the 19th and early-20th centuries, Britain was the primary
supplier of much of the world’s coal used as bunker fuel, and the cost of bunker coal thus
increased the farther one was from Britain. Fuel costs on the voyage back to Britain were higher
than on the outbound voyage. Marginal costs could also have been different because crew costs
were different in the two directions. Lewis Fischer (1989) has claimed that the markets for ablebodied seamen in northern European ports were not well-integrated, and that seamen earned more
if they were hired at major ports, such as Liverpool. There is also ample evidence that Indian

- 12 -

seamen on British ships earned less than their European counterparts. Indian seamen formed a
substantial portion of the British shipping labor force, as high as 20%. Potentially, ships could
lower marginal costs by hiring in lower-wage ports en route to or at their destination. Likewise
ships and crewmembers could agree to part company at low-wage ports of call along the journey.
If freight rates in the two directions were determined separately, we would expect that
competitive pressures would have driven freight rates on each leg to the point where they would
equal marginal cost per unit space or weight (and average total costs) for that leg. The demand
and freight rate for shipping on the two legs would have been equal only by chance. Assuming
that the demand for shipping on the homeward leg exceeded the demand on the outbound leg, one
of two cases would have arisen, given that the supply of shipping in the both directions had to be
equal. If the entire demand for shipping on the homeward leg was met by supply (at some
competitive freight rate), then there would excess supply available on the outbound leg. Thus,
some, if not all, ships plying the homeward route would be filled to less than full capacity, and
the cost of carrying these goods would not be covered for these ships. In long run competitive
equilibrium, ships making losses would leave the route. Then, the entire demand on the
homeward route would not be met, and there would be a shortage of shipping space in the
outbound route. Alternatively, suppose the entire demand was supplied by shipping space on the
outbound route. In this case, there would be a shortage of shipping in the homeward direction,
and we would see shippers bidding freight rates up. Freight rates would exceed the marginal cost
of making that leg of the voyage. Thus ships on the homeward route would be making excess
profits.
However, barriers to entry on any route were insignificant in the long run. Ships setting
freight rates on the two legs jointly could still earn profits on the journey as a whole. If x were the
profit per unit earned by the ships on the homeward direction, a profit could be earned by setting
freight rates in the following manner:
Ph = MCh + ax

a<1

(3.4)

- 13 -

Po = MCo - abx

b<1

(3.5)

Ships setting freights separately would have to lower rates to get any cargo. Again, given
the absence of barriers to entry, ships could take away all business on the outbound route from
these ships charging rates according to (3.5) by further lowering the freight rate by setting a new
b, denoted b* such that 1<b*<b in equation 3.5. The argument can be repeated so that in the
competitive equilibrium, b will in fact equal 1. Thus Po = MCo – ax.
As long as demand for shipping in one direction is greater than demand in the other, ships
will continue to face inelastic demand on the voyage leg with greater demand. The argument
above can be repeated, until at the combination of rates Ph* and Po* where the demand in both
directions will be equal. By the argument here,
Ph* = MCh + x*

(3.6)

Po* = MCo – x*

(3.7)

Obviously, Ph* + Po* = MCh + MCo, which will be equal to the average total cost of the journey
taken as a whole. No profits are earned for the journey taken as whole and marginal costs on both
legs are just covered even though the freight rates do not equal marginal (and average total) costs
on either leg of the journey.
Finally, there is a possibility that demand on the outbound leg will be lower than demand
on the homeward route no matter what the freight rates are. When the freight rate is zero on the
outbound route, demand for shipping is infinite. Ships have the option of either taking the cargo
for free, or undertaking the outbound voyage in ballast. Since there are costs associated with
loading and unloading cargo, ships may prefer to travel in ballast, since loading and unloading
ballast was generally less expensive than handling cargo. If some ships do decide to take cargo on
the outbound route, freight rates for the outbound cargo would equal the average cost of
collecting, carrying and unloading them. Freight rates on the homeward cargo would equal the
average total cost of the roundtrip voyage less the marginal cost of carrying outbound cargo.
Total costs of the journey still equal total revenue.

Two minor adjustments complete the analysis. First, in the long run, owners will want to
use their ships with “optimal” qualities fitting the specification of the trade and the route so that
the cost of operation is minimized. Costs included the interest paid on the price of the ship.
Larger, faster and more specialized ships were more expensive to build. This tradeoff saw tramp
ship owners purchasing ships that were not entirely top-of-the-line, but of medium sizes and
moderate speeds, with few or no special fittings for particular trades. The ship-building industry,
itself an extremely competitive industry, contributed to this trend by churning out medium-sized
steamers in anticipation of demand, and these were sold at prices much lower than those of madeto-order vessels (Pollard and Robertson 1979: p. 20). It was thus possible by the 1930s for the
tramp ship owner to describe an “ideal” tramp ship as a medium-sized, moderate speed
nondescript jack-of-all trades steamer with no special fittings for any particular type of trade
(Sturmey 1962: p. 35).
The second adjustment is only cosmetic, and it has to do with our assumption that all
ships originated from a single homeport. The competitive conditions still hold even if ships
originate at different homeports at the two ends of the shipping route, given the need for ships to
return to their origins. The sum of the freight rates on the different legs will still equal the sum of
marginal costs. Thus, changing this assumption would only require changing the wording of the
exposition here.
The analysis can of course be extended to journeys with more than one leg, as long as the
condition holds that the supply of shipping space in one leg implies a supply of shipping space in
another leg of the journey. Thus, economic profits on a tramp journey from Britain, dropping off
coal at Suez, traveling in ballast over the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea to Bombay, and traveling
back to Britain with a cargo of general goods would be zero in long run competitive equilibrium,
just as they would be zero if the coal were to be carried through Suez and dropped off in Bombay
instead. The freight rate on the homeward route from Bombay would have to be the same no

- 15 -

matter which route was taken to get there. The freight rate on coal to Suez and the average cost of
traveling in ballast from Suez to Bombay would have to equal the freight rate on coal to Bombay.
There was another kind of joint production relevant in this period (Harley 1990). Freight
rates were determined jointly not only on the different legs of the journey, but also for different
commodities carried on any single leg of a voyage. This jointness arose because of the disparity
between bulk and weight of different commodities and the limitations of navigational technology
in this period that required buoyancy to be filled.
Freight rate, and thus productivity gain, calculations should control for a mixture of
commodities as well as for a mixture of legs (Harley 1990: p. 158). Calculations of productivity
gains that do not take into account both types of jointness of production could be misleading. If
the index for a particular leg of a voyage were used in calculating productivity gains, and if
freight rates on that leg fell faster than freight rates on the journey taken as a whole, productivity
gains would be overstated. Similarly, if freight rates on the individual good fell much faster than
on other commodities, productivity gains would be overstated.
It is difficult to adjust for the second kind of joint production simply because the
interrelationships among different cargoes were so complex. Luckily, on the routes where freight
rates for different commodities were interrelated, we are often able to isolate time series of freight
rates that were determined independently. In the case of the North Atlantic trade, where joint
production of the second kind were particularly important, Angier’s data present us with a series
of charter party freight rates charged by tramp steamers that carried only grain to Europe. No
adjustment is necessary in this case for the second type of joint production. Our productivity
gains results for the Baltic, however, require the disclaimer that joint-production of grain freights
with timber freights were not taken into account.
The first type of joint production between different legs of the journey is easy to
accommodate. As our analysis above demonstrates, as long as there is no joint production of the
second type, the sum of freight rates per unit weight or space would equal the sum of marginal

- 16 -

costs of the different legs of the journey. Thus, even though the individual freight rates on
individual legs of the journey do not equal the marginal cost associated with undertaking the
voyage on that leg, freight rates on the voyage taken as a whole do equal the average total cost of
the voyage. We add outbound coal freights (per ton) to the freight rate (per ton) on the homeward
journey on that route for a commodity with stowage factors similar to grain. This sum should
equal the average total cost of the journey in long run competitive equilibrium.

Total Factor Productivity Growth

Harley (1988) calculates productivity gains on the UK-Bombay route for the outbound
coal trade and the inbound general goods trade and thus implicitly confronts the joint-production
problem raised above.7 First, we redid Harley’s calculations for the period between 1871-3 and
1887-9 using much improved factor price data, in particular new wage and coal price data
(Appendix 3). Second, we extended the calculations to 1909-11. Third, and in order to increase
generality, we added TFP growth measurements for three other routes – UK-East Coast of North
America, UK-Alexandria and UK-Riga – again using data for outbound coal freights and inbound
bulk commodities with stowage factors similar to that of grain. The pre-war TFP growth results
are summarized in Table 4.
Between 1871/3 and 1887/9, 50-65% of the fall in freight rates can be explained by the
decline in factor prices. Falling ship prices, driven by the introduction of cheap iron hulls and
productivity gains in the shipbuilding industry, resulted in around 25-35% of the fall in freight
rates. Productivity gains in the coal industry no doubt contributed to the fall in coal prices, but the
decline in shipping costs also meant that Welsh bunker coal picked up at non-British ports was

His TFP growth calculations are taken from his 1972 Ph.D. dissertation (although Harley does not
mention joint-production in the thesis).

- 17 -

getting cheaper. Productivity gains in the shipping industry account for the rest of the fall in
freight rates (35-50%).
These productivity estimates differ from Harley’s. Harley estimates annual TFP growth
for the Bombay route between 1873/4 and 1890/1 to have been 3.1%, while we estimate a more
modest, and perhaps more plausible, 1.6%. Part of the difference can be attributed to the fact that
our freight rate index falls less steeply, and this fact can be explained mainly by his inclusion of
the unusual years 1874 and 1890 in the calculation. We elected to choose less unusual end point
years since 1874 saw freight rates spike upward to a half-decade high, while 1890 saw freight
rates collapse to their lowest.
Productivity growth rates on our other three sampled routes were lower than those on the
Bombay route. TFP growth along the ENA and Alexandria routes were the lowest of the four
presented in Table 4. The probable explanation is that these two routes had already absorbed the
new changes in steam technology and thus they are likely to have recorded higher TFP growth
rates in the 1860s and early 1870s; after all, steam technology was well established in the
transatlantic trade by the early 1870s. Alexandria also had been early in adopting the steamship
since the new technology was not susceptible to variable Mediterranean winds. In contrast, the
Bombay route introduced the steamship only with the construction of the Suez Canal in 1869.
Naturally, the adoption of the new technology saw higher subsequent productivity gains along the
route.
The Riga route, though closer to Britain, was slower in adopting the new shipping
technology than were either the ENA and Alexandria routes. The route had long been known as a
backwater for older and slower vessels, but the gap between the mean age of the British fleet and
the age of British ships in the Baltic was narrowing in the 1870s and 1880s, and by the start of the
1880s, the majority of the Baltic timber trade was carried on steamships (Fischer and Nordvik
1987: pp. 103-5). Thus steam technology came on in a rush during the 1870s and 1880s, and this

- 18 -

fact contributed to the rapid TFP gains along the Riga route, much like those along the Bombay
route.
Average export prices for British coal were increasing between 1887/9 and 1909/11, and
on the shorter routes such as the Baltic and the Mediterranean, coal freight rates did not fall
quickly enough to override the rise in “world” coal prices. The cost of bunker fuel at foreign ports
along these routes thus increased, retarding the fall in freight rates especially on the Riga and
Alexandria routes. For the ENA and Bombay routes, coal freights fell fast enough to overcome
the rise in “world” coal prices. Along the Bombay route, the fall in the price of bunker fuel
contributed to about 10% of the fall in freight rates. Along the ENA route, the effect of coal
prices was negligible.
Declining ship prices induced a similar fall in freight rates in both periods. During this
second period, however, there is also a wider variation of TFP growth among routes. Continued
high productivity in the Baltic can partially be explained by continued diffusion of steam
technology along the route: while other routes had gone over to steam almost entirely by the
1890s, about 20% of Baltic ships trading in timber were still powered by sail even at the turn of
the century (Fischer and Nordvik 1987: p. 105). For other routes, it is more difficult to make the
argument that these big productivity gains were a function of the diffusion of steam technology.
The old transatlantic route underwent an acceleration in TFP growth between 1871/3-1887/9 and
1887/9-1909/11, achieving TFP growth rates similar to those along the Bombay route, where
rates had been maintained.
The availability of outbound coal freight rates for Alexandria and North America make it
possible to extend these calculations up to 1932-4, immediately prior to the introduction of
government regulations in 1935 that aimed at limiting competition in tramp shipping (Sturmey
1962: p. 110). In order to exclude the effect of the First World War, we conduct two calculations:
the first is for the period between 1909/11 and 1932/4, and the second for the period between
1923/5 and 1932/4. The results are summarized in Table 5.

- 19 -

Factor prices jumped during the First World War, and even by 1923/5 wages, ship prices
and fuel prices were still about double those in 1909/11. Thus, even though post-war nominal
factor prices declined, they never recovered their pre-war levels in the 1920s. It was the inflated
factor prices that prevented freight rates from falling, not slow productivity advance. Indeed,
interwar TFP growth rates were at least as high as pre-war: TFP growth rates for ENA actually
doubled after 1909/11, those for Alexandria also rose, and only those for Bombay fell.
TFP growth rates between 1923/5 and 1932/4 were much smaller for all three routes than
they were between 1909/11 and 1932/4, implying that the First World War induced substantial –
but temporary -- improvements in productivity, no doubt due to full capacity demands in wartime.

IV. Explaining Productivity Gains

The revolution in shipping technology has been recounted many times (e.g. Pollard and
Robertson 1979: pp. 9-24). This revolution rested on two developments: the decrease in iron, and
later steel, prices that made economical the introduction of new metallic hulls in ship construction
in the second half of the 19th century, and the advances in engine technology that saw vast
increases in fuel efficiency. These changes were related to changes in the metallurgical, chemical
and engineering sciences that spilled over into the shipbuilding industry. The results were lower
ship prices for larger and faster ships allowing British firms to wrest leadership in shipping from
the Americans by the 1860s. Britain maintained this leadership unchallenged until the First World
War, when British ship owners rejected the more efficient diesel engine for the older, trusted
steam engine.
How did changes in shipping technology affect the industry? We are told (e.g. Pollard
and Robertson 1979) that iron and steel allowed for larger ships with bigger steam engines that
reduced coal consumption and increased speeds. These changes also made it possible to reduce

- 20 -

crew sizes, and to take advantage of economies of scale. Given all these benefits, why the big
differences in adoption and diffusion between routes?
We have the input data for the period between 1869 and 1913 that will help us seek
answers to these questions. Much of the data documenting the quantity of labor used, time spent
at sea and in port, the size of vessels and engines on various routes come from the impressive
Atlantic Canada Shipping Project (ACSP) dataset constructed at the Memorial University of
Newfoundland. The ACSP data come from the British Agreements and Accounts of Crews,
official documents that had to be filled by any British ship whenever a crewmember joined its
ranks. The data includes a 1% random sample of all voyages by British ships between 1863 and
1914. The rest of the pre-1890 data utilized here, particularly the coal consumption data mainly
come from Harley, and we have extended these series up to 1913 by scouring contemporary
shipping sources. We have much less information about the interwar period, though Sturmey’s
(1962) study of British shipping was quite useful.
Cargo Capacity (Hull Weight)
Using ship, steel and iron price data, Harley (1972: p. 311) estimates that average hull weight fell
by about 10% between 1870 and 1890. Pollard and Robertson (1979: p. 14) report that the
introduction of steel, largely after 1890, reduced hull weights by 15%. Most new ships
constructed on the Clyde in 1890 were made of steel. Allowing for the diffusion of steel in the
tramp shipping industry, as well as the slight increase in cargo capacity generated by the
improvement in coal consumption, it seems likely that two-thirds of this 15% increase in cargo
capacity took place between 1890 and the First World War, while the rest took place in the
interwar period.

- 21 -

Crew Size
Harley (1972: p. 255) admits that his crew size data are suspect.8 Using the ACSP data, we can do
better. The ACSP reports the number of crewmembers that ships intended to hire for over 4500
individual journeys between 1869 and 1913. After dividing the prewar years into nine five-year
periods, we regressed the intended number of crewmembers per gross registered tonnage on the
period, the square of the period, the gross tonnage (to take into account ship size) and horsepower
per gross tonnage (to take into account the size of engines). The results are statistically significant
at the 99% confidence interval. The number of crewmembers per gross registered ton decreased
over time, though this fall gradually leveled off. Having more powerful engines increased crew
size, possibly because more firemen and coal trimmers were required. The coefficient on gross
tonnage is also statistically significant, and negative, telling us that ship operators took advantage
of economies of scale by shedding labor per tonnage. We use these regressions results to calculate
crew sizes along all routes between 1869 and 1913.9
Ship Size
We also use the ACSP data to estimate the increase in ship size along various routes. Again
dividing the period between 1869 and 1913 into 9 five-year periods, we regress ship size on
period, controlling for regions. The regional coefficients on all but West Africa are statistically
significant. Furthermore, average ship size increased over time on all routes. There were, of
course, pronounced regional differences, with the largest ships being used in the North Atlantic

8

Using figures for total tonnage and total employment in the British merchant fleet taken from the Trade
and Navigational Returns, he finds average employment per gross registered ton for every year. He then
uses these figures in his productivity calculations. His method does not control for the size of ships and
engines, both of which varied by route.

9

Crew sizes differed somewhat by route, as contemporary accounts inform us. Certainly the composition of
the crew differed by route. A large segment of the British tramp ship labor force was comprised of Asians
(known as “lascars” in contemporary accounts) from South and Southeast Asia, hired primarily on Indian
ocean routes because they were better able to withstand the tropical heat. However, a crew size regression
with regional controls was not statistically significant.

- 22 -

trade.10 Larger ships were also used along South African and Australian routes. In the Baltic and
Spanish trades, smaller vessels were used, lending support to the contemporary literature’s
description of the former as a backwater for older vessels.
Coal Consumption
Harley (1972: p. 273) uses well-respected contemporary engineering sources to conclude that
coal consumption was reduced from 2.1 to 1.6 lbs per Indicated Horse Power per hour (IHP)
between 1871 and 1885. Henning and Trace (1975: p. 365) tell us that coal consumption fell more
slowly thereafter, to about 1 lb per IHP hour in the late 1930s. The quadruple compound engine
had not been introduced in 1885, but when it was, it resulted in a significant reduction in coal
consumption, to about 1.25 lbs per IHP per hour in 1914 (Pollard and Robertson: p. 20). Harley
(1972: p. 261) also provides estimates for the ratio of IHP to Net Horse Power (NHP). NHP was a
statistic of engine volume, and the ratio is needed to insure comparability across periods.
According to Harley, the ratio increased from 5 in 1875 to 6 in 1885. Cage (1997: pp. 150-60)
reports that “typical” tramp steamers of around 4000 gross registered tons bought by Burrell &
Sons of Glasgow around 1910 carried engines of about 300-320 NHP. The Hughes (1917: p. 310)
handbook, a well-respected shipping manual of the period, estimates that the IHP on the typical
ship was around 2000. All of this implies that the ratio of IHP to NHP stood at a bit less than 7 in
1913.
Engine volume for 1869-1913 can also be estimated from the ACSP data by regressing it
on gross tonnage, period and square of period. The results are statistically significant at the 99%
confidence interval. Engine volumes decreased over time, but increased with ship size, implying
that improved engine technology and fuel efficiency allowed a tradeoff between smaller engines
and larger ships.

10

Harley (1989: pp. 153-4) tells us that North Atlantic tramps competed fiercely with large liners for grain
freights, explaining the larger tramp ship sizes along this route.

- 23 -

Time Spent at Sea
ACSP data reporting days at sea per gross ton were regressed on period, period squared, gross
tonnage, horsepower per gross ton and the number of ports visited along the way. The results
showed that days at sea per gross ton fell with increasing ship size, implying economies of scale.
However, time spent at sea was not falling, holding ship size constant. Along the ENA route, the
coefficient on the period variable was positive and significant. Along the Alexandria route, the
positive coefficient on the period-squared variable was so large that days at sea per gross ton
actually increased by the second period. For the Riga and Bombay routes, the positive coefficient
on the period-squared variable was large enough for days spent at sea per gross ton to be
increasing up to 1914. Days spent at sea per gross ton would have been decreasing over time only
if speed was chosen over ship size. For a route such as ENA, where tramp ships would have to
compete with larger liner vessels, it seems that larger ships were always chosen. Voyage charter
parties did not stipulate fixed routes or schedules for hired tramp vessels. This implies that there
was no premium for speed in the tramp shipping business, which carried mostly low value
commodities. Clearly, ship owners would lean toward size rather than speed, as the data confirm
for the other routes.
Port Turnaround Times
The ACSP data was also used to determine by regression time at port. Days in port per gross ton
decreased with increasing ship size, implying economies of scale. However, for the port of
Antwerp, the coefficient on the period variable was positive. For Bombay, Alexandria and Riga,
the period-squared variable was positive, and large enough for time at port per gross ton to be
increasing by the fourth period, implying that technology may not have kept up with the
increasing volume of trade at every port.

- 24 -

Explaining TFP Growth in the Age of Steam

The ACSP data allow us to say something about the components of productivity growth
during the age of steam. True, the total factor productivity growth implied by the ACSP data in
Table 6 does not always reproduce the calculations of the previous section, but we only use Table
6 to identify which forces accounted for most of the pre-war productivity advance along four
major routes, not to get another estimate of aggregate TFP growth.
In the first two decades (1871/3-1887/9), increasing ship size contributed significantly to
total factor productivity growth, ranging from about a quarter along the Bombay route to about a
third along the ENA and Alexandria routes. Increasing ship size contributed to about half of TFP
growth along the Riga route. We have already alluded to the increase in vessel size along Baltic
routes as ship size converged to the British fleet average, and Table 6 confirms its importance to
TFP growth. The increase in load capacity contributed about the same to the increase in
productivity. This was particularly true of the ENA route (60.9%), where vessels were so much
larger. Scale economies made possible reductions in crew size, a force that accounted for a tenth
to almost a third of productivity growth. As predicted, the strongest effect (33.6%) was along the
ENA route, plied as it was by the largest ships.
There seems to have been a tradeoff between size and speed along some routes,
particularly ENA. For Bombay, the sharp decline in voyage time was no doubt facilitated by
faster passages through the Suez Canal. The fact that coal consumption decreased along this
route, supports this hypothesis. Had speeds increased at the rate that would have created the
observed drop in voyage time, coal consumption would likely have increased. Decreasing coal
consumption on all routes contributed to about a tenth of the productivity increases in this period.
In any case, the big surprise is the major decrease in port turnaround times. For the Bombay and
Alexandria routes, its contribution to productivity growth was almost as high as the direct effect
of the increase in ship size.

- 25 -

For the second two decades (1887/9–1909/11), the causes of TFP growth are less
uniform, although rising ship sizes and load capacity are still dominant forces. Indeed, the
increase in ship size contributed even more to the growth on three routes: for Riga and Alexandria
they contributed between 76 and 86% of the increase in TFP, and for Bombay about half. The
effect along the ENA route decreased only a little, from 30 to 28%. The contribution of improved
load capacity was similar to the previous periods, except along the ENA route. Gains from
improved fuel efficiency fell between the first and second periods before the War. In the shorter
Baltic route, coal consumption still managed to fall due to improvements in engines. In the longer
routes like Alexandria and Bombay, however, the tradeoff between coal consumption and ship
size favored the latter. Ship speeds seem to have decreased considerably as well. On the Baltic
and Bombay routes, increased ship sizes led to increases in port turnaround times. On the other
routes, it seems that ports were able to keep up with the demands placed upon them by larger
ships carrying larger loads. Labor savings did not contribute prominently to TFP growth.
The results for the period immediately before the First World War suggest explanations
for the discrepancy between the ENA and Alexandria interwar TFP growth (Table 5). Perhaps the
port of Alexandria could not keep up with increasing ship size. Improvements in steam engine
technology had slowed down by the First World War, and as we have seen, even before the War,
steam technology could not keep up with increased ship sizes on some routes. The new diesel
technology held promise, but British ship owners were slow in adopting the more efficient diesel
engine for reasons that are hotly debated in the shipping history literature. Griffiths (1995: p. 318)
has drawn a connection between negative perceptions of the diesel engines by many industry
leaders and their sympathies for the faltering giant coaling industry. He notes that industry leaders
believed that British domination of long-range coal exports contributed significantly to its prewar dominance in long distance shipping. Griffiths than argues that prior dependence on cheap
coal freights led to a slow adoption of diesel technology. If Griffith’s argument is correct, ship
owners on the ENA route would let go of their old ways more easily since that route was less

- 26 -

dependent upon the transportation of coal (Harley 1972: p. 318). Tramp ships along the ENA
route had to compete fiercely with liner companies for freights on bulk commodities. These
conditions, not prevalent elsewhere, may have forced ship owners on the ENA route to adopt
faster and larger ships as well as diesel engine technology.
The big gap between the lower TFP growth rates over the years 1923/5 to 1932/4 and the
higher rates over the longer period 1909/11 to 1932/4 need explanation. The discrepancy implies
that the First World War saw very sharp increases in TFP growth, and that these transitory rates
were not only unsustainable, but even reversed in the interwar period. Sturmey (1962: p. 51)
informs us that war profits in tramp shipping were high, even taking into account higher
insurance and replacement costs. The need for quick delivery of war material implied a push for
fast turnaround times, a price the market was willing to pay in a wartime cost-plus environment.
Faster and larger ships would also have minimized the time spent at sea exposed to enemy attack
and to maximize the amount that could be carried per journey. The ship’s capacity would also be
pressed beyond free-market optimal levels during wartime when governments were willing to pay
very high prices for the fastest delivery possible. The influx of speculative capital (Sturmey 1962:
p. 53) would have allowed ship owners to purchase more advanced steam technology, when
previously they had opted for less advanced but cheaper ships. The collapse of speculative profits
at the end of the war, and in the decline of global trade in the interwar period reversed the
productivity advances of the war period. With the break in ship prices in 1920, British ship
owners over-invested in second-hand ships, hoping that the boom in freights would continue
(Sturmey 1962: p. 58). The interwar period was “troubled” (Sturmey 1962: pp. 61-97) by idle
tonnage. These low-capacity handicaps were imposed by nationalistic policies of foreign
competitors, by the inability of British ship owners to take advantage of new trades -- such as
tankers, and by their inability to exploit new technologies -- such as diesel engines, either due to
lack of capital or to technological conservatism.

V. Conclusion

Revisiting the Isserlis index confirms that nominal tramp shipping freights did fall
drastically in the period between 1869 and 1913. Indeed, the Isserlis index understates the fall in
freight rates in both this and the interwar period. Our new global index however masks wide
regional variation in the behavior of freight rates in the age of steam. Differences can be
explained by joint production of shipping freights, among journey-legs and commodities carried
on routes. Freight rates did fall globally, but the exact behavior of rates depends on these routespecific factors, not just distance.
Deflating regional indices constructed here by actual commodities carried on these routes
rather than by the Sauerbeck index that includes non-tradables and tradables not carried on these
routes also makes a difference. The Sauerbeck-deflated indices often understate the fall in real
transport costs in this period.
Linking with David Hummels’ (1999) research on post-Second World War shipping, we
are for the first time able to take a long-run view of oceanic transport costs. The decline in
nominal freight rates in the pre- First World War period slowed down in the interwar period, and
is actually reversed after the Second World War. Hummels (1999) has shown that even though
real freights fall sharply over the half century following 1950 when deflated by a GDP deflator,
commodity-deflated real freight rates hardly fall at all. In short, the fall in freight rates during the
age of steam has not been matched since.
Our TFP calculations, explicitly taking into account joint-production, corroborate the
results of previous research and confirm that the decline in global freight rates was not driven just
by falling input prices. Indeed, while ship prices did fall throughout the pre-First World War
period, coal prices and wages actually rose after the mid-1880’s. Rapid technological change
drove the steep fall in real freight rates before the First World War, and a marked slow down in
technological change contributed to the stability in those rates during the interwar years. The

- 28 -

intensity of this technological experience varied across routes, based, no doubt, upon different
rates of diffusion of new steam technologies.
Not all types of technological change in the shipping industry were equal in their impact.
Nor did these changes have a uniform impact across routes. Ship-owners tried to balance the
tradeoff between increasing ship size and capacity, increased speeds, lower coal consumption and
smaller crew sizes, and route-specific factors determined their decisions. Port turnaround times
affected TFP growth as well, and not always positively, since ports did not always keep up with
increasing ship sizes and capacities. The literature on the port development and costs is virtually
non-existent, and it needs attention.
While David Hummels has examined the post-World War II period in some detail, we
feel that more work needs to be done on the interwar period. While the interwar years saw a slowdown in TFP growth in British tramp shipping, the paucity of compiled data on factor costs and
quantities has limited our ability to examine the causes of the slow down. Why British tramp
shipping – for so long at the forefront of technological innovation – failed to embrace the
emerging diesel technology in this period is a question that requires further examination. If the
rapid fall in shipping costs, whose causes we have examined here, lies at the heart of pre-First
World War globalization, then the interwar deceleration in the fall of freight rates can perhaps
help shed more light on the contrasting interwar retreat from globalization.

Appendix 1: Construction of the Isserlis Index

Implicitly, Isserlis assumes the following statistical process for the movement of any
commodity-routes freight rates:
Fxn/Fxn-1 = A(x,n) + Uxn

(A1.1)

where Fxn and Fxn-1 are freight rates in the nth and n-1th year respectively for route x. A(x,n) is
some route- and time-specific function formed from the set of conditions that caused freight rates
to change year to year. Uxn is a random error term distributed around 0 and it is introduced
because Isserlis Fxn and Fxn-1 are really the simple arithmetic averages of the highest and lowest
freight rates made available to Isserlis from the Angier data.
Isserlis then takes the average of all the commodity-route chain indices available for each
year. Thus the global freight rate chain index for the year n+1 relative to the year n is:
Gn+1 = [ΣA(x,n) + Uxn]/k

(A1.2)

where k is the number of commodity-route ratios that are available for that year. Isserlis then
implicitly uses large sample averages to claim that ΣUxn goes to zero. He is thus left with:
Gn+1 = ΣA(x,n)/k

(A1.3)

To derive an index based in the first year in the dataset, one would of course use the following:

In+1 = Π Gi

(A1.4)

where In+1 is the index entry for the year n+1 based on the level of freight rates in the year 1.
The index can then be rebased in any single year.
A number of problems with this method of construction are immediately obvious. First,
for Gn+1 to be representative of the level of global freight rates relative to rates in the previous
year, the sample of commodity-routes included in the years average will have to be representative
of the distribution of global trade in shipping. Isserlis makes no attempt to confirm this. Second,
Isserlis’ implicit invocation of large sample properties seems inappropriate. The largest number

- 30 -

of observations Angier has in any year is around seventy (not all of whom have corresponding
entries in the previous years). In early years, sample sizes are around thirty. In some years,
sample sizes are around fifteen or twenty. For the First World War years, sample sizes hover
around ten.
Small sample sizes may lead to a bias in the final index because ΣUxn does not go to
zero. Because of the way that Isserlis’ final index is derived, if this bias exists in any year, it
persists in all subsequent years, and is even multiplied. Suppose Cn is the correct index entry for
the nth year, and bn is a bias. Then, in the chain index:
Gn = Cn + bn

(A1.5)

In Isserlis’ final index, the entry for the n+1th year is:
In+1 = Π(Ci+bi)

(A1.6)

Thus if bi ≠ 0 for all years before n+1, the bias persists in all subsequent years, and even
increases, as it is multiplied with the index entries in the subsequent years.
Finally, for the index to preserve the long-run behavior of global freight rates, the method
in which the index was constructed requires that freight rates on different commodity-routes
move more or less similarly to each other from year to year. This is easy to verify. Suppose there
were two freight rate series, both of which started at the same level and ended up at the same
level at the end of two years, but one of which had the fall taking place in only the first year and
the second seeing the fall in only the second year. Obviously, the final freight rate index
constructed a la Isserlis would not preserve the long run movement of these two freight rate
series. In fact, the aggregate index, in this case, would have fallen slower at the end of two years
than either series used in its construction. This problem is only compounded by the fact that
Isserlis deals with quite small samples. Freight rates were extremely volatile, and it is
unreasonable to assume that they would move lockstep with each other. Clearly, Isserlis’ index
must be replaced.

Appendix 2: Construction of the Regional and Global Freight Rate Indices

Angiers 1869-1950
The Angier dataset was broken up into smaller regional datasets based upon the location
of ports and the availability of data. Wherever possible, ports that were included in a region were
not separated from each other by more than 10% of the distance from Europe.11 We also
separated outbound from homeward routes. Consulting contemporary sources that reported
commodity stowage factors, we identified commodities with similar stowage factors for each
region.
Starting with the first year in this restricted regional dataset, we took a segment of the
dataset covering all years in which the freight rates for the same commodity-routes were quoted.
We then took the simple average of these quoted freight rates for each year, and formed an index
from these averages. We then took the year that immediately followed the last year in the first
segment, and formed a new segment covering all years which contained the same commodityroutes. Again, we took the simple average of the freight rates quoted for each year, and formed an
index from these averages. If the first and second segments had some commodity-routes in
common, we linked them in the following manner: We first take the simple average of the freight
rates on the shared commodity-routes in the last year of the first segment in which this overlap
takes place. We mark this as A. We then take the simple average of the freight rates on the shared
commodity-routes in the first year of the second segment in which this overlap takes place. We
mark this as B. We rebase the second segment index in Bs year. We form the ratio of B to A. We
multiply all the entries in the rebased second index with this ratio. This rebased second segment is
then grafted to the first segment to form an index covering the full period.

11

For two regions out of seventeen – East Asia (comprising of the Philippines, Japan and China) and West
Africa – data limitations forced us to violate this condition.

- 32 -

If the first and second segment have no commodity-routes in common, we form a third
segment with all years where the freight rates of exactly the same commodity-routes as the year
immediately following the last year of the second segment were quoted. We form a index for this
segment in the same manner described above. We then see if the segment shared commodityroutes with the first segment. If so, we link the first and third index in the manner described in the
last paragraph. To link this combination index formed from the first and third segment indices
(“first-third combination index”) to the second segment index we first link the second and third
indices in the manner described in the last paragraph (to form the “second-third combination
index”). We rebase the second-third combination index in the year (call it year X) in the third
segment that was used for linking the third segment to the second segment. We then multiply all
entries in this rebased second-third combination index with the entry for year X in the first-third
combination index.
Obviously, if the first, second and third segments do not share commodity-routes, the
procedure can be repeated until segments with some overlapping commodity-routes are found. Of
course, the procedure does not guarantee that each segment with have overlapping commodityroutes with some other segment. If this happens, we are forced to find new freight rate data that
will allow us to carry out the linking.
Note that it does not matter what year within segments is taken as the base year. The ratio
of the average of nominal freight rates at any year to the average of nominal freight rates at
another year within the segment is preserved independent of the choice of base year. We are thus
able to rebase segments at the linking years and not introduce any biases. To link across
segments, it is assumed that had Angier been consistent in his choices of commodity-routes, the
missing data would not substantially change the ratio of the average nominal freight rate in one
segment’s linking year to the average nominal freight rate for another segment’s linking year
from the ratio calculated from the incomplete data. The competitive nature of the tramp shipping

- 33 -

industry and the fact that we are including routes where only commodities with comparable
stowage factors were carried allow us to feel somewhat comfortable with this assumption.
Our global index of long distance tramp freight rates between Europe and the rest of the
world requires us to weight the different regional indices according to the importance of trade to
and from that region. We use the Board of Trade figures (Mitchell 1992) to compute the value of
trade between Britain and the different regions in the dataset, and find the percentage of total
trade to these regions to Britain being carried from individual regions. These percentages formed
the weights for the homeward routes. For outbound coal freights on various routes, the limitations
of the Angier data forced us to take the simple average of available indices of coal freights along
the routes. The outbound coal freight and the homeward freight indices were then aggregated
taking their simple average.

Linking Angiers with the Post-WW II Era
The Norwegian Shipping News (NSN) index for tramp voyage charter party freight rates
reported by Hummels (1999) is based in 1947, but has a gap between 1947 and 1952. Since our
Angiers-based global freight rate index has an entry for 1945-49, the NSN index can be easily
linked to it. To fill the gap between 1947 and 1952, the Italian freight index reported by Sturmey
(1962: p. 179) is used.
Even though the three indices used here relate to tramp shipping from different countries
and are weighted up differently, they are highly correlated. Hummels (1999: p. 27) reports a
correlation of 0.87 between British and Norwegian charters rates, and we computed a correlation
of 0.99 between the Italian and Norwegian indices.

Appendix 4: Productivity Growth Calculations
Wages
Nearly a century after they were compiled, Bowley’s indices of income and wages
remain standard sources for the late-19th and early-20th century Britain.12 Bowley included in his
work a wage index for British able-bodies seamen (ABS) covering the years between 1870 and
1890. The information is taken from 11 voyages started each from year from each of the major
ports in Great Britain. Harley used this index in his productivity gains calculations. For the period
between 1890 and 1913, the Board of Trade collected wage rates for various classes of seamen. It
is easy to construct an index of wage rates for seamen by taking unweighted averages (i.e., fixed
weights) of wage rates for various classes of seamen.
However, crew composition must have changed drastically in this period. Due to
economies of scale and increasing steam engine efficiency, the number of ABS, firemen and coal
trimmers would have decreased. The share of officers in the crew would thus have increased, as
the number of officers would have remained more or less fixed. Given the fact that officers were
paid more than ABS, Bowley’s index would have overstated the fall in average crew wages. It is
easy to see that taking an unweighted average of wage rates for the various classes of mariners
does precisely the same thing.
The Atlantic Canada Shipping Project (ACSP) at the Memorial University of
Newfoundland has compiled a 1% random sample of British Agreements and Accounts of Crews
between 1863 and 1913. These were official documents mandated by law and were required to be
completed whenever a crew signed onto a ship, regardless of the port. The documents included
such information as ship and voyage details, as well as rank and personal information of

- 35 -

individual crewmembers, including the wage rates agreed upon by them. Overall, we have
information on about 80,000 seamen of all ranks in this sample. Taking the simple average of
wage rates for all seamen – regardless of rank – in a particular year and forming an index from
these averages improves upon Bowley’s and Feinstein’s in two ways.
First, the index does not depend solely upon wages quoted in major British ports. True,
the crew on British vessels was mostly hired in Britain, and hiring most of the necessary crew in
one location was more efficient than stopping at a number of ports to add crewmembers and
incurring associated costs. Large ports like Liverpool and London were also centers of the
shipping labor market, but expanding the wage estimates to include non-British seamen hired in
non-British ports is a significant improvement. Second, taking a simple average of wage rates for
all seamen takes into account changing crew composition. As crew composition changes, the
number of observations for each rank relative to the total number of observations for that year in
our sample also changes. In effect, the simple average of wage rates is weighted, according to
crew composition. The wage rate index created does not have a fixed-weight bias toward the
wages for a particular rank
The ACSP sample ends in 1913. For the period between the two World Wars, we turn to
Chapman’s average earnings data collected from the Annual Yearbook of the National Maritime
Board (summary of Agreement) and the quinquennial censuses of seamen. This index is a
weighted average of monthly rates for various ranks of seamen, and controls for different sizes of
vessels. The wage rates reported do not include overtime pay.

Cost of Capital
The cost of capital in each period was calculated from the following formula:
CKt = PKt (r + d)

12

Feinstein (1972) improved on these data recently by revisiting Bowley’s sources.

- 36 -

where CKt is the cost of capital in time t; r is the interest rate; d is the rate of depreciation; PK is
the price of the ship per gross ton in that period. As has been standard in the literature, we assume
that r and d remain unchanged in this period.
A number of studies have examined ship prices in the age of steam. We use data from
Harley (1972: pp. 250-57) to estimate average ship price per ton for the period between 1871 and
1889. Pollard and Robertson use data from Fairplay magazine to trace the price of
“representative” ships in the period between 1887 and 1913. It is unclear to what degree the
Pollard-Robertson index controls for increasing vessel size, but we assume that it represents ship
prices per gross ton, with a standard engine attached, allowing for changes in engine quality. For
the interwar period, we use the Maywald index of British ship prices, also used by Feinstein
(1972: p. T137) in his construction of an index of British capital expenditure.13

Price of Coal
Ideally, we would have liked to have taken into account the price of coal at bunker
(refueling) ports on each route. However, reliable bunker coal price series are unavailable.
Instead, we construct a bunker coal price index in two steps. First, we take the sum of the freight
rate for coal shipped to the destination and the average price of British exported coal (reported by
Sauerbeck) as a initial proxy for the price of bunker coal. Second, the initial bunker coal proxy
price index is then multiplied by 1.25 to take into account port costs during refueling.

Port Charges
Urquhart published a review of charges and dues in non-British ports regularly in the
second half of the 19th century. This work was continued by Ritherdon in the first half of the 20th
century. While these publications suggest that port charges per gross registered ton may have

13

Both Pollard-Robertson and Harley note serious problems with this index, especially since it does not
control for the increasing complexity of navy ships whose prices Maywald used to construct the index.

- 37 -

fallen over the period, it is difficult to say by how much. Therefore port charges are ignored in
our TFP calculations.

Factor Shares
We use Harley’s (1972: p. 312) estimates of factor shares for the period between 1869
to1890. These were mined from contemporary sources. Roberts (1947: p. 297) presents the shares
of various inputs in coal-burning steamers in the early 1920s. These factor share estimates are
comparable to Harley’s for the late 19th century. Griffiths’ (1995: pp. 323-26) reports of operating
costs in 1922 and 1926 agree with this assessment. Fayle’s comparative figures for a ship voyage
from Cardiff, to Algiers, New Orleans and Rotterdam in 1913 and 1920 also suggest that it is
reasonable to use Harley’s factor share estimates for the period between 1890 and 1913 as well as
for the 1920s. These factor share estimates are presented in table following:

Factor Shares (%)
Capital Costs (interest, depreciation, repairs)
Fuel Costs (Coal)
Labor Costs (Wages + Provisions)
Port Charges
Others

These factor shares are used as fixed weights for the entire period in the productivity calculations.

Appendix 5: Explanation of the TFP Growth Calculation

The explanation for TFP growth using quantities of factors used is derived as follows:
A* = Pi* – Pf* = Q* – Qi*
where A* is the percentage change in total factor productivity, Pi* is the percentage change in the
index of factor prices weighted by factor shares, Pf* is the percentage change in the freight index,
Q* is the percentage change in the quantity of goods carried, and Qi* is the percentage change in
the index of quantities of inputs weighted by factor shares. The percentage change in quantity of

- 38 -

goods carried, Q* = K* + F*, where K* is the rate of increase in the size of ships, F* is the rate of
increase in cargo capacity (the load factor).
Given factor shares from the previous appendix:
A* = K* + F* - (0.4K* + 0.2C* + 0.1L* + 0.25 Qt* + 0.05O*)
where C* is the rate of change in the quantity of coal consumed on the journey, L* the rate of
change in the quantity of labor, Qt* the quantity of usage of port facilities, and O* the quantity of
other inputs.
We have figures for the number of seamen and the amount of time spent at sea and port
in the voyage, the amount of labor in labor-hours is L* = Ln* + (S+T)*, where S is the amount of
time spent at sea, T is the amount of time spent at port, (S+T)* is the rate of change in the length
of the voyage, and Ln* is the rate of change in the number of workers. Similarly, port charges
would have been calculated per day spent at port. So the correct quantity of the port input takes
into account the number of days spent at port. Port usage thus changes at the rate of QT* =
(QT/day)* + T*. It is assumed that Qt/day and O are directly proportional to the ship size and
load factor.
Similarly, coal consumption figures are per hour. Coal is assumed to have been
consumed only at sea, and C* = (C/day)* + S*. Similarly, the price of capital is expressed per
unit time. Thus,
A* = 0.3K* + 0.7F* - [(0.2C/day)* + (0.1L/day)* + + 0.2S*+ 0.25 T* + 0.5(S+T)*]
