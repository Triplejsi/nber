The Regulation of Labor

NBER Working Paper No. 9756
June 2003
JEL No. J1, J6
ABSTRACT
We investigate the regulation of labor markets through employment laws, collective bargaining
laws, and social security laws in 85 countries. We find that richer countries regulate labor less than
poorer countries do, although they have more generous social security systems. The political power
of the left is associated with more stringent labor regulations and more generous social security
systems. Socialist and French legal origin countries have sharply higher levels of labor regulation
than do common law countries, and the inclusion of legal origin wipes out the effect of the political
power of the left. Heavier regulation of labor is associated with a larger unofficial economy, lower
labor force participation, and higher unemployment, especially of the young. These results are
difficult to reconcile with efficiency and political power theories of institutional choice, but are
broadly consistent with legal theories, according to which countries have pervasive regulatory styles
inherited from the transplantation of legal systems.

I. Introduction
Every country in the world has established a complex system of laws and institutions
intended to protect the interests of workers and to guarantee a minimum standard of living to its
population. In most countries, this system encompasses three bodies of law: employment law,
industrial and collective relations law, and social security law. Employment laws govern the
individual employment contract. Industrial and collective relations laws regulate the bargaining,
adoption, and enforcement of collective agreements, the organization of trade unions, and the
industrial action by workers and employers. Social security laws govern the social response to
needs and conditions that have a significant impact on the quality of life, such as old age,
disability, death, unemployment, and maternity.
In this paper, we examine these laws in 85 countries through the lens of three major
theories of institutional choice: the efficiency theory, the political power theory, and the legal
theory. The efficiency theory holds that institutions adjust to serve the needs of a given society
most efficiently. Each society chooses a system of social control of business that optimally
combines market forces, dispute resolution in court, government regulation, and corrective taxes
and subsidies. Under the political power theory, institutions are shaped by those in power to
benefit themselves at the expense of those out of power. Both voting and interest group politics
allow the winners to benefit at the expense of the losers, with checks and balances on the
government limiting the extent of redistribution. Finally, under the legal theory, a country’s
approach to regulation is shaped by its legal tradition. Common and civil law countries utilize
different strategies for dealing with market failure: the former relying on contract and private
litigation, the latter on direct supervision of markets by the government. Under this theory, the

2

historical origin of a country’s laws shapes its regulation of labor and other markets.2
Our focus on labor laws might be particularly helpful in distinguishing the political
power theory from the legal theory. Roe (2000) and Pagano and Volpin (2000) have recently
argued that the political power of labor has been central to legal and regulatory design of the 20th
century (Roe 2000, Pagano and Volpin 2000). Using data on OECD countries, these authors
challenge the observation of La Porta et al. (1997, 1998) that the differences in financial
development among common and civil law countries are best understood in terms of legal
theories. Roe (2000) in particular argues that civil law is simply a proxy for social democracy.
An analysis of labor laws gives these political theories their best shot, for two reasons. First, we
expect leftist governments to focus on labor regulations as a top priority for benefitting their
supporters. Second, because labor laws are relatively recent, we would not necessarily expect a
profound influence of the commercial legal tradition on their structure.
To assess these theories, we collect data on employment laws, collective bargaining laws,
and social security laws as of 1997 for the Djankov et al. (2002) sample of 85 countries, and
code these data to come up with a variety of measures of worker protection. We combine these
data with already existing (and some newly collected) information on economic development,
leftist orientation of governments, union power, political and economic constraints on
government action, and legal origins to examine the determinants of the regulation of labor. We
also examine data on the unofficial economy, labor force participation, unemployment, and
relative wages to consider who benefits and who loses from the regulation of labor.
The available research on labor regulations is more extensive than that on most other
2

In footnotes, we also consider the cultural theory, under which regulations are shaped by a
country’s cultural history, such as the dominance of particular religious groups. The data do not
support this theory, so we keep its discussion to a minimum.

laws. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development has sponsored the creation
of a database of labor regulations in member countries (Nicoletti, Scarpetta, and Boylaud 1999;
Nicoletti and Pryor 2001). The World Bank has assembled a data base of International Labor
Office certifications for 119 countries, which provide a partial view of the labor laws as well
(Forteza and Rama 2000). Heckman and Pages-Serra (2000) collect and examine an extensive
data set of job security regulation for Latin American and Carribean countries. Mulligan and
Sala-i-Martin (2000) assemble and analyze data on social security systems. What distinguishes
our data from the previous efforts is a combination of a significant coverage of countries and a
comprehensive approach to labor market regulations. 3
In the next section, we briefly describe some of the principal theories of the determinants
of labor regulations and develop our hypotheses. In section III, we describe the data. In section
IV, we present the data on the regulation of labor, and describe some of its basic regularities. In
sections V and VI, we present the tests of alternative theories. Section VII concludes.

II. Hypotheses
Efficiency
Demsetz (1967) and North (1981) propose that the choice of institutions is dictated
primarily by efficiency considerations. In their original form, these theories hold that there are
fixed costs of setting up institutions, and that it becomes socially efficient to set them up only
when the benefits cover the costs. More recently, research on efficient institutional choice has
focused on the idea that different institutional arrangements, ranging from reliance on unbridled
3

There is also an extensive literature on the consequences of regulation of labor, including
Lazear (1990), Besley and Burgess (2002), Fonseca, Lopez-Garcia, and Pissarides (2000),
Heckman and Pages-Serra (2000), and Ichniowski, Freeman, and Lauer (1989), among others.

market forces, to contract and private litigation, to government regulation, to subsidies and social
insurance, represent alternative modes of dealing with torts and market failures, which may be
appropriate in different circumstances.4 For example, different combinations of these strategies
may be efficient in developed and developing countries.
Here we consider two versions of this theory. The first focuses on the distinction
between regulation and social insurance. Social insurance may be the relatively more efficient
way of dealing with market failures in countries with a lower social marginal cost of tax
revenues, which presumably are the richer countries (Brennan and Buchanan 1980, Becker and
Mulligan 2000). Poor countries must then regulate to protect workers from being fired or
mistreated by employers, whereas rich countries provide unemployment insurance, sick leave,
early retirement and so on because they can more cheaply raise taxes to finance such operations
(Blanchard 2002). A similar argument would maintain that rich countries can better rely on
courts and contracts to address potential market failures, including those in the labor market, and
so do not need as much regulation as do poor countries, where contracts cannot be enforced.
The second version of the efficiency argument predicts exactly the opposite. It holds that
the principal cost of regulation, relative to other forms of social control of business, is its
potential for abuse of regulated firms by the government and its officials. Labor regulations can
be used to force firms to hire and keep excess labor, to empower unions friendly with the
government, etc. According to this argument, the rich and better governed countries have a
comparative advantage at regulation relative to other forms of social control of business because
their governments are less likely to abuse power. This view with respect to regulation in general

4

This argument is developed in Glaeser and Shleifer (2002, 2003), Glaeser, Scheinkman and
Shleifer (2003), and Djankov et al. (2003b).
5

is described by Djankov et al. (2003b).
The basic thrust of efficiency theories is that countries at different levels of economic
development should adopt different regulatory structures. The variation in patterns of
regulation can also suggest which efficiency forces, if any, shape the regulation of labor. We
note, however, that labor markets are not an ideal testing ground for efficiency theories, because
the basic assumption of market failure is not nearly as convincing in those markets as in some
others, and because there is no compelling argument that labor laws evolved toward efficiency
through a long period of testing and social negotiation.

Political Power
According to political power theories, institutions are designed not to pursue efficiency,
but to transfer resources from those out of political power to those in power, as well as to
entrench those in political power at the helm (Marx 1872, Olson 1993, Finer 1997). According
to this view, institutions are not only generally inefficient, but are in fact designed to be so by
political leaders to help themselves and their favored groups.
Political power theories come in two basic varieties. The first holds that the principal
mode of political decision making is elections, and therefore the parties that win elections get to
shape laws. The second variety, which applies to both democracies and dictatorships, holds that
laws are shaped by the influence of interest groups (Olson 1965, Becker 1983).
Political power theories are by far the dominant explanation of the choice of labor
regulations. In the electoral version, they hold that regulations protecting workers (or at least
employed workers) are introduced by socialist, social-democratic, and more generally leftist
governments to benefit their political constituencies (Esping-Andersen 1999, Hicks 1999). In
6

the interest group version, these theories hold that labor regulations are a response to the
pressure from trade unions, and therefore should be more extensive when the unions are more
powerful, regardless of which government is in charge.
Political theories also hold that the ability of those in power to use regulations to benefit
themselves is limited by checks and balances on the government, which can come either from
politics (Buchanan and Tullock 1962) or from markets. Dictatorships are less constrained that
democratically elected governments, and therefore will have more redistributive laws and
institutions. Constitutions, legislative constraints, and other forms of checks and balances are all
conducive to fewer regulations. This theory found some empirical support in our previous work
on the regulation of entry (Djankov et al. 2002). Likewise, economies open to trade may be less
likely to introduce expensive regulations, because competition makes it less lucrative for
governments to raise firms’ regulatory costs (Ades and DiTella 1999, Rajan and Zingales 2003).

Legal Theory
Legal theory has received considerable attention in the discussions of institutional
evolution in the last several years. Two very distinct legal traditions evolved in Western Europe
since the 12th century: common law and civil law. Common law emerged in England and is
characterized most clearly by the importance of decision making by juries, independent judges,
and the emphasis on judicial discretion as opposed to codes. From England, common law was
transplanted to its colonies, including Ireland, U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India,
Pakistan and other countries in South and East Asia, East Africa and the Caribbean.
Civil law evolved from Roman law in Western Europe through the middle ages, and was
incorporated into civil codes in France and Germany in the 19th century. Civil law is
7

characterized by less independent judiciaries, the relative unimportance of juries, and a greater
role of both substantive and procedural codes as opposed to judicial discretion. Through
Napoleonic conquest French civil law was transplanted throughout Western Europe, including
Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, and Holland, and subsequently to the colonies in North and
West Africa, all of Latin America, and parts of Asia.
The German code became accepted in Germanic Western Europe, but also was
transplanted to Japan and from there to China, Korea, and Taiwan. Socialist law was adopted in
countries that came under the influence of U.S.S.R., while an indigenous Scandinavian legal
tradition developed in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Finland.
The legal theory holds that countries in different legal traditions utilize different
institutional technologies for social control of business (Djankov et al. 2003b). Common law
countries tend to rely more on markets and contracts, and civil law (and socialist) countries on
regulation (and state ownership).5 For the labor market, this implies that civil law countries and
socialist law countries should regulate labor markets more extensively than common law
countries. The legal theory would also predict that common law countries should have a less
generous social security system, because they are more likely to rely on markets to provide
insurance. Perhaps most importantly, the legal theory predicts that patterns of regulation of
different activities are correlated across countries. These predictions are tested below. 6

5

Legal theories have been tested in other areas of law. Compared to civil law and particularly
French civil law countries, common law countries have better legal protection of shareholders
and creditors (La Porta et al. 1997, 1998), lighter regulation of entry (Djankov et al. 2002), less
formalized legal procedures for resolving disputes (Djankov et al. 2003a), and securities laws
more focused on private contracting than regulation (La Porta et al. 2003a).
6

Because legal systems were transplanted largely through conquest and colonization, one can
argue that the influence of the legal origin is an exogenous determinant of institutional choice.
8

Legal theories have been challenged by advocates of political power theories, such as
Roe (2000) and Pagano and Volpin (2000), who argue that at least in Western Europe, the civil
law tradition has often coincided with the political pressure to regulate, usually coming from the
left. By combining extensive data on political orientation and legal origins for a sample of 85
countries, we attempt to distinguish the pure political power from the pure legal theory. We
also argue, at the end of the paper, that reality is probably best described by a hybrid model.

III. Measures of Labor Regulation
We construct a new data set describing the legal protection of workers in 85 countries in
1997. We gather data on the three components of the legal framework for worker protection: (i)
employment laws; (ii) industrial (collective) relations laws, and (iii) social security laws.
To identify issues subject to statutory regulation in the area of employment and industrial
relations laws, we use the OECD Jobs Study (1994) and the International Encyclopaedia for
Labor Law and Industrial Relations. For social security laws, we follow the de-commodification
index of Esping-Andersen (1999), regarded as a leading empirical comparison of social security
systems among developed countries (Hicks, 1999, p. 249). We also rely on several crosscountry secondary sources, including the International Encyclopaedia for Labour Law and
Industrial Relations, the ILO’s Conditions of Work Digest (1994, 1995), and the U.S. Social
Security Administration’s Social Security Programs Throughout the World. For each law in
each country, we identify the government regulation of each specific area, and assign a higher
score when a regulation is more protective of a worker. We then construct indices for each area
of the law that aggregate these scores. Table I contains detailed definitions of all the variables
used in the paper.
9

To ensure comparability and consistency across countries, we consider a “standardized”
male worker with the following characteristics: (i) he is a non-executive full-time employee
working in the same firm for 20 years;7 (ii) his salary plus benefits equals the country's GNP per
worker during the entire period of employment; (iii) he has a non-working wife and two
children, and the family has always resided in the country’s most populous city; (iv) he is a
lawful citizen who belongs to the same race and religion as the majority of the country’s
population; and (v) he is not a member of a labor union (unless membership is mandatory). For
social security, we also assume that the worker retires at the normal retirement age as defined by
the country's laws; sickness lasts for 2 months; and the unemployment spell lasts for one year.
We also assume a “standardized” employer with the following characteristics: (i) it is a
manufacturing company wholly owned by nationals; (ii) its legal domicile and main place of
business is the country’s most populous city; (iii) it has 201 workers; and (iv) it abides by every
law and regulation, but does not grant workers more prerogatives than are legally mandated.
Also, (i) when both a standard duration and a possible extended period of time are provided by
law, we choose the standard period; (ii) we use 30-day months and assume 22 working days per
month and 5 working days per week; and (iii) when we find complementary coverage
mechanisms, all applicable mechanisms are taken into account.

Employment laws
Employment laws govern the individual employment relation, including the formation of
the individual labor contract, the mandatory minimum terms and conditions of such contract, and
7

Results are similar for a worker with only three years of employment.
10

the termination of the contractual relation. Accordingly, we group the provisions of
employment laws into three broad areas: (i) alternative employment contracts; (ii) conditions of
employment; and (iii) job security. For each area, we collect several indicators and aggregate
them into sub-indices and then the overall index of employment laws. We follow the same
procedure for industrial relations and social security laws.
The first broad area covers restrictions placed on alternative employment contracts. If the
regulation of alternative contracts is more flexible than that of regular contracts, the former will
be used to by-pass standard labor provisions. The three main alternatives to the standard
employment contract are part-time, fixed-term, and family members’ contracts. Workers hired
under such contracts are typically paid lower benefits and are subject to less onerous termination
rules. Our indicators in the alternative employment contracts sub-index cover both the
permissibility and the characteristics of these contracts.
The second broad area covers the conditions of the employment contract. The legal
provisions here cover three areas: (i) flexibility on working time requirements (including
mandatory daily rest, maximum number of hours in a work week, premium for overtime, and
restrictions on work at night and on weekends); (ii) mandatory payment for non-working days
(including paid annual leave, holidays, and maternity leave); and (iii) minimum wage legislation.
The third broad area is job security, or legal protection against dismissal, which
encompasses: (i) grounds for dismissal; (ii) procedures for dismissal; (iii) notice period; (iv)
severance payment; and (v) the constitutional principles covering protection against dismissal.
The rules on grounds for dismissal range from ‘contract at will,’ where the employment
relation may be terminated by either party at any time and with no limitations other than those
contained in the agreement, to allowing the termination of employment contracts only under a
11

very narrow list of ‘fair’ causes that may not be contracted around by the parties, to refusing to
consider dismissal on economic necessity (redundancy) as a fair cause for firing employees. The
law may restrict the employer’s freedom to dismiss by requiring mandatory notification or even
the approval from unions, workers councils, the public employment service, a labor inspector, or
a judge. Some countries also require rehabilitative measures (retraining and allocation of
another job within the enterprise) prior to the dismissal, and establish priority rules for dismissal
or re-employment of redundant workers. Job security regulations also cover the timing and the
cost of dismissal. Some countries mandate a lengthy advance notice for termination, while
others leave this issue to the individual employment contract. Similarly, the termination of the
employment agreement sometimes carries no payment at all or a payment in lieu of notice.

Industrial relations laws
Industrial relations laws aim at collectively protecting workers from employers.8 They
govern the balance of power between labor unions and other forms of organized work, and
employers and associations of employers. We aggregate industrial relations laws into three subindices: (i) collective bargaining; (ii) workers’ participation in the company’s management; and
(iii) collective disputes (strikes and lockouts), and then aggregate those into an index.
Collective bargaining covers several areas. First, some countries require employers to
bargain with organized workers (e.g., unions and workers’ councils), while others allow them to
refuse to do so. Second, in some countries collective agreements are extended to third parties as

8

Some provisions aim to protect workers from other workers. For instance, “right-to-work” laws
in the U.S. protect workers from unions by prohibiting the exclusive hiring of union labor. Such
cases are rare and the bulk of industrial relations provisions directly protect workers from
employers.
12

a matter of public policy at the national or sectoral levels, whereas in others they only extend to
non-signatory workers at the plant level, or only bind the parties to the agreement. Third, the
laws of some countries include rules requiring the exclusive hiring of union labor in certain
industries or factories (closed shops).
The second sub-index captures worker participation in management, which may take the
form of mandatory appointment of workers to the board of directors (the German model of codetermination), or workers councils (the Swedish model). Most countries do not provide a
mechanism for worker participation. These two variables (and the presence of worker
participation in the constitution) form the sub-index of worker participation in management.
The third sub-index covers the regulation of collective disputes. This area covers: (i)
legal strikes; (ii) procedural restrictions to strikes; (iii) employer defenses; (iv) compulsory
arbitration; and (v) the constitutional protection of the right to strike. A few nations have a
straight prohibition of strikes; others limit the types of lawful strikes. For example, solidarity
strikes (to support the claims of workers other than the striking workers), wildcat strikes (not
authorized by the labor union), political strikes, and sit-ins are often prohibited. Procedural
restrictions on the right to strike include majority voting, advance notice requirements,
prohibitions on strikes while a collective agreement is in force, and the obligation to go through
conciliation procedures before the strike may take place. Restrictions on employer defenses may
include bans on employers’ strikes (lock-outs) and on employers’ retribution against strikers,
such as the termination of employment of striking workers and the hiring of replacement labor
during a lawful strike. Importantly, in many countries, the employer or both of the parties may
be subject to arbitration against their will. Finally, the right to industrial action may be protected
by the constitution.
13

Social Security laws
The bulk of social security expenditure across countries addresses old-age pensions,
sickness and healthcare coverage, and unemployment. Following the design of the decommodification index of Esping-Anderson9, our variables cover the risks of: (i) old age,
disability, and death, with an emphasis on old age; (ii) sickness and health, with an emphasis on
sickness; and (iii) unemployment. We code five variables for each one of these three risks. The
first is always a dummy measuring whether the laws of the country provide for a mandatory and
comprehensive social security system to cover the particular risk.
For the sub-index of old age, disability and death, the other four indicators are created as
follows. First, the generosity of pension protection is calculated as the normalized difference
between the legal retirement age and the worker’s life expectancy. The second indicator is the
required time of contributions to access a pension. We measure the number of months of
contribution or of covered employment required by law to qualify for a standard pension. The
third indicator is the percentage of the worker's monthly salary deducted by law to cover oldage, disability, and death benefits. Our last indicator of the level of protection of the pension
system is the “replacement rate,” calculated as the percentage of the pre-retirement salary
covered by the standard old-age cash-benefit pension.10 We use a similar methodology for the
sub-indices of sickness and health, and of unemployment.

9

Esping-Anderson used the share of the relevant population covered as a weight for the variables
in his index for 18 developed countries. This information is not available for a large sample of
countries, so we present the un-weighted data. The correlation between the Esping-Anderson
index and our index of social security laws for the 18 countries in his sample is 0.47.
10

Countries vary in the type of pension system they have, including lump-sum systems, private
systems, and systems that provide fixed benefits to everyone. Table I describes the details of
how the calculations are made depending on the type of the pension system.
14

Independent Variables
We assemble data on a number of potential determinants of labor regulations, as well as
some labor market outcomes. We measure the level of development using the (logarithm of) per
capita income in 1997 – the same year as when the regulations are measured.
To measure government orientation, we expand the World Bank data base, which records
the fraction of years between 1975 and 1995 that a chief executive and the largest party in the
legislature in each country was rightist, leftist, or centrist. We present results for three variables
measuring leftist government (these variables yield the strongest results in favor of the political
theory): (i) chief executive of left or center orientation; (ii) legislature of left or center
orientation; and (iii) chief executive AND legislature of left or center orientation. We rely on
union density and the percentage of the labor force covered by collective agreements as proxies
for the influence of labor interest groups.
To measure political constraints, we take from Djankov et al. (2002) constraints on
executive power, effectiveness of legislature, and autocracy. To measure economic constraints,
we take from Frankel and Romer (1999) actual trade openness in 1985, geographic openness,
and factor accumulation openness. To test legal theories, we use the legal origin of commercial
laws from La Porta et al. (1999). Labor market outcomes include the size of the unofficial
economy, labor force participation, unemployment including that of the young, and a crude
measure of relative wages of protected and unprotected workers.

IV. A Look at the Data

15

Table II presents the sub-indices and indices of employment protection and industrial
relation laws for each country in the sample. Countries are ordered by per capita income in
1997 and divided into the poorest quartile, the next 50 percent, and the richest quartile. We also
compare the means and the medians of the various sub-indices and indices across income groups.
Recall that all variables are coded so higher values mean more protection/regulation.
A comparison of New Zealand and Portugal, two countries of roughly similar incomes
close to the top of the middle group, illustrates our indices. In the area of employment laws,
fixed term contracts can be entered in New Zealand for any reason, and there is no maximum
duration period provided by law. In Portugal, such contracts are allowed only for specific
situations (such as substitution for another worker or seasonal activity) and are temporary in
nature. The Portuguese Constitution regulates working times and leaves, remuneration, and
working conditions, matters that in New Zealand are normally regulated by collective bargaining
and individual employment contracts. Premium for overtime work in Portugal ranges from 50%
to 75%, there are restrictions on night work, and there are 24 days of paid annual leave. New
Zealand mandates no premium for overtime work, there are no restrictions on night work, and
paid annual leave is 15 days. New Zealand allows “contracts at will,” which can be terminated
with notice by either party without cause. Portugal has a public policy list of fair grounds for
termination and stringent procedural limitations on dismissal, such as mandatory notification of
the government and priority rules for re-employment of redundant workers. In New Zealand,
“reasonable notice” is required to dismiss a worker, in Portugal the length of such notice is
mandated by law. The employment laws index in Portugal is 2.36 (one of the highest in the
world); in New Zealand it is 1.06 (one of the lowest in the world).

16

In the area of industrial relations laws, the Portuguese Constitution includes the rights to
engage in collective bargaining and collective disputes, the right to form trade unions, and the
rights of such unions to participate in the management of individual companies and in greater
political issues and bodies. Employer defenses against strikes are prohibited by the Constitution.
Employers have a legal duty to bargain with unions, collective agreements are extended to third
parties by law, workers councils are mandatory, and employer lockouts are prohibited. In New
Zealand, none of these issues are covered in the Constitution, and most are not even regulated by
law. Employers have no legal obligation to bargain with unions, collective agreements are not
legally extended, labor participation in management is not mandatory, and employer lockouts are
allowed. Portugal’s collective relations laws index is 2.26, compared to 0.43 for New Zealand.
Finally, although social security is regulated by the Constitution in Portugal but not in
New Zealand, both countries have similar – and generous – social security systems, with each
scoring 2.15. We show below that New Zealand and Portugal are representative of broader
patterns in the data.
As Table II shows, most countries restrict alternative employment contracts, conditions
of employment, and job security. There is little evidence of any major difference in regulation
between the poorest and the middle income countries, but there is clear evidence that the richest
countries, if anything, protect employment less.
With respect to industrial relations laws, collective bargaining mandates are extremely
common, but appear to be more so in middle income countries than in either the poorest or the
richest countries. Worker participation in management is uncommon everywhere. The
regulation of collective disputes is similar across income groups. For the overall index of

17

regulation of industrial relations, collective bargaining mandates dominate, and show the greatest
empowerment of collective bargaining in the middle income countries.
Table III focuses on social security protections. Here the results are clear: richer
countries have more extensive social security protection in all areas, including old age, disability
and death, sickness, and unemployment. Indeed, few poor nations have social security programs
for sickness (54%) and unemployment (27%) as compared to the almost 100% availability of
these programs in the richest countries. The three sub-indices describing the scope of social
security benefits tell a similar story.
Table IV presents the correlations among our variables. First, looking across countries,
the correlation between our index of employment laws and that of social security laws is 0.0746,
which argues against the view that regulation and social insurance are substitutes. Second,
leftism and legal origin are weakly correlated other than in socialist countries. This allows us to
empirically separate the role of leftist politics and legal traditions in shaping labor laws.

V. Testing the Theories
In Table V, we examine the relationship between the protection of workers and legal
origin, holding income constant. We present the results for all three areas of law. The results
confirm our earlier finding that employment protection is generally weaker in richer countries,
regulation of industrial relations does not monotonically depend on income, and social security
protections increase sharply with income. The results further show that, relative to common law
countries, socialist and French legal origin countries mandate sharply higher employment
protection. German legal origin countries have somewhat higher employment protection than
do the common law countries (but not in the area of restricting employment contracts), while
18

Scandinavian countries are about the same as the common law countries. The magnitude of the
difference between common law and French civil law countries (holding GNP per capita
constant) is large: it is 1.25 times the difference between the richest and the poorest countries.
In the area of industrial relations, we see a somewhat different pattern. As with worker
protection, socialist and French legal origin countries have sharply higher worker protection
through industrial relations laws than do the common law countries. But here, although the
evidence for the sub-indices is weak, German and Scandinavian law countries have more
protective collective relations laws than do the common law countries.
In the area of social security, there is clear evidence of more generous regulation in the
socialist legal origin countries than in the common law countries (except in the area of old age
benefits). Next to the socialist countries, the Scandinavian countries have the most generous
social security systems relative to the common law countries. The difference between French
civil law and common law countries is less pronounced, and is the highest for sickness and
health benefits. There is no statistically significant difference between German legal origin and
common law countries in the generosity of social security schemes.
Table V delivers a preliminary message. In the protection of workers through
employment and industrial relations laws, we see a repetition of a now well-documented result
that civil law countries, and especially French civil law countries, regulate markets more heavily
than do the common law countries (La Porta et al. 1999, Djankov et al. 2002). Perhaps the most
striking fact about these regressions is the high R2's: 52% for the employment laws index, 33%
for the industrial relations laws index, and 66% for of the social security laws index (where per
capita income has significant explanatory power).

19

Table VI examines the effect of left political power on the protection of workers. First,
countries with longer histories of leftist or centrist governments between 1975 and 1995 have
heavier regulation of labor markets, as measured by either employment or industrial relations
laws. In addition, on any measure of leftist/centrist government, countries with a longer history
of such government have more generous social security laws.11 Second, a higher percentage of
the labor force covered by collective agreements is associated with more protective employment
and industrial relations laws, though not with more generous social security systems. In
contrast, union density is associated with more generous social security systems although it does
not influence labor laws significantly. Third, the explanatory power of the political variables is
sharply lower than that of legal origins in Table V. The bottom line of Table VI is that the
measures of leftism are associated with heavier labor regulation, although their explanatory
power is smaller than that of legal origin.
Table VII presents the results of a horse race between legal origins and measures of
leftist government. We run these regressions without socialist countries, since law and politics
are nearly perfectly correlated among those countries. Except for social security laws, where
there is marginal evidence of greater generosity in more leftist countries, the effect of our
political variables on labor laws disappears. On the other hand, the effects of legal origins
remain highly statistically significant, and the coefficients hardly change. We conclude that the
11

These results also hold, although at lower level of statistical significance, if we use the pure
leftist government variables (rather than the combination of leftist and centrist governments). As
an additional robustness check, on the theory that many labor laws were adopted before 1975,
we rerun these regressions using a new data set on political coloration of governments starting in
1928. For these longer horizon variables, there is no evidence that the fraction of years that the
leftist (or leftist/centrist) executives, or legislatures, or both, spent in office has influenced the
structure of employment and collective relations laws. All measures of leftist power continue to
be associated with more generous social security regimes, a fact that undermines the claim that
we have a poor measure of leftist power.
20

effects of legal origin on the regulation of labor are much larger and more pronounced than those
of politics.12
Several findings emerge from this section. First, socialist and French legal origin
countries are more interventionist in their employment protection and industrial relations laws
than are common law countries. Second, leftist government and higher union influence are
associated with heavier regulation of labor markets, although these results are not consistent
across specifications and do not survive the inclusion of legal origin in the regression. The
evidence so far provides strong support for legal theories, is consistent with a particular version
of the efficiency theory, and does not lend much support for the political theory. Moreover, the
results (including the correlations) reject the view that legal origin and leftism are the same
thing.

VI. Further Tests
In this section, we examine four additional pieces of evidence bearing on alternative
theories. First, we ask whether political and economic constraints on government reduce the
regulation of labor, as the political theory would predict. Second, we ask whether politics
matters for regulation within legal origin, which is a hybrid legal/political hypothesis. In
addition, we present some evidence bearing on the strong prediction of the legal theory, namely
that countries have regulatory styles, and that therefore there should be a strong correlation
across countries of the extent of regulation of different activities. Finally, we examine some of

12

We also considered the effects of the religious composition of the population in 1900 -- our
proxy for culture -- on contemporary labor laws. There are a few statistically significant
coefficients indicating that catholic countries have more protective labor laws, but the evidence
is weak, and does not survive a horse race with legal origin.
21

the consequences of labor regulation with the twin goals of testing the efficiency theories and of
understanding who gains and loses from the regulation of labor.

Constraints on Government
Under the political theory, a more constrained executive would pursue less aggressive
policies favoring his supporters at the expense of others, such as the regulation of labor.
Constraints can come from politics itself: autocrats are less constrained than elected officials,
effective legislatures can restrain the sovereign, constitutions may include checks and balances
(Brennan and Buchanan 1980, Henisz 2000, La Porta et al. 2003b). Alternatively, constraints
can come from markets, and in particular, openness to trade raises the cost of labor market
intervention and thus may reduce it (Ades and DiTella 1999, Rajan and Zingales 2003).13 The
prediction of the political theory is that such constraints would be associated with lower levels of
government regulation of labor, other things equal.
Table VIII presents the correlations between our six measures of economic and political
constraints and other determinants of the regulation of labor. The three measures of political
constraints are strongly correlated with each other, as well as with the level of per capita income.
This fact presents a problem for testing political constraints theories, since the measures of
political constraints may just reflect some other country characteristic associated with
development. The three measures of trade openness are also highly correlated with each other,
but only factor accumulation openness is highly correlated with income. On the other hand,

13

Openness to trade may be endogenous, but we follow Frankel and Romer (1999) in also using a
measure of “natural openness,” which is determined by a country’s geography.
22

except for the fact that governments in socialist countries face few economic and political
constraints, the constraint variables are not strongly correlated with legal origins.
Table IX examines the effect of constraints on government on regulation. The table
shows that more constrained governments have lighter regulation of labor markets in both the
employment protection and industrial relations areas. The results hold as well if we exclude
socialist countries. Basically, every measure of constraints except factor accumulation openness
works. The constraints variables also eliminate the negative effect of development on
employment regulation. Put differently, that effect might have come from the fact that richer
countries have more constrained governments. Despite the statistical significance of the
coefficients, the explanatory power of these constraints is sharply lower than that of legal
origins. With respect to social security, the evidence is less consistent, but again shows that more
constrained governments have smaller systems.
In Table X, we restrict the sample to non-socialist countries, and check whether these
effects of political and economic constraints remain significant once we control for legal origin.
The results for political constraints disappear, those for openness become a bit stronger. Legal
origin remains a very important determinant of the patterns of labor market regulation.

Regulation Within Legal Origin
It may be possible to treat the legal and the political theories as complementary. The
former holds that civil law countries, particularly the French civil law countries, specialize in
regulation as a means of social control of business, whereas the common law countries specialize
in contracts and markets. Because of transplantation, these patterns of institutional
specialization are largely exogenous. One could further argue that, because of such
23

specialization, French civil law countries are more likely to respond to the increased political
demand for regulation by having more of it than do the common law countries, since the
marginal social cost of providing such regulation is lower. Put differently, civil law provides a
ready tool box for regulation, whereas common law is not nearly as user-friendly because of its
emphasis on contracts. This logic predicts that there should be a stronger positive association
between leftism and regulation in French civil law than in common law countries.
Table XI shows that, indeed, within French civil law but not within common law
countries, leftism is associated with more protective employment and industrial relations laws.
The difference in slope coefficients on our measures of leftism between common and French
civil law countries is typically statistically significant. This result still puts the legal theory
center stage, and surely does not support the view that legal origin is a proxy for social
democracy. On the other hand, the result points to a hybrid view that within the institutional
technologies dictated by legal systems, politics indeed plays a role in regulatory choice.

Regulation Across Activities
One of the strongest implications of the legal hypothesis is that societies have regulatory
styles shaped in part by their legal systems, and that therefore societies that regulate one activity
are also expected to regulate others, which might be totally unrelated. We have already shown
in earlier work that French civil law countries regulate entry of new firms, dispute resolution in
courts, and other activities more heavily than do common law countries (La Porta et al. 1999,
Djankov et al. 2002, 2003a). The findings of this paper are broadly consistent with this research.

24

Table XII presents the correlations between our new measures of regulation of labor
markets and the measures of regulation of entry from Djankov et al. (2002) and measures of
legal formalism from Djankov et al. (2003a). The data show that all these aspects of regulation
go together, even though the methodologies of data collection differ tremendously across the
three studies. The correlation between the employment law index and the judicial formalism
index is 0.48 for one case, and 0.58 for the other. The correlation between the employment law
index and the logarithm of the number of steps required to start a business is 0.62. These
correlations fall by about 0.05 if we exclude socialist countries, but remain highly statistically
significant. Regulatory style is pervasive across activities -- a striking confirmation of the legal
theory.
Combined with the previous findings of the interaction between legal origin and politics,
these results suggest that countries have regulatory styles, shaped primarily by transplantation of
legal systems. Politics plays a role within the general regulatory framework presented by these
styles, but it is neither as important as the styles themselves, nor is it a proxy for them.

Outcomes
Finally, we consider some of the consequences of the regulation of labor. Theoretically,
this is of interest for two reasons. First, efficiency theories predict that heavier regulation of
labor markets should be associated with better, and certainly not worse, labor market outcomes.
This prediction has been contradicted by a variety of empirical studies from Lazear (1990) to
Besley and Burgess (2002), and here we confirm their findings. Second, if the regulation of
labor is damaging at least to some workers, then who benefits from it? Put differently, is there
political support for the heavier regulation of labor, or does legal origin simply provide a
25

politically unsupported “technology” for the social control of labor markets? Since, as we have
already shown, more leftist governments in French civil law countries regulate labor markets
more heavily, we expect to find some beneficiaries of such regulation.
We look at several potential consequences of labor regulation. These include the size of
and the employment in the unofficial economy, male and female participation in the labor force,
and unemployment computed separately for everyone, and for male and female workers aged 2024. In addition, as a crude measure of relative wages of protected and unprotected workers, we
consider the average wage of machine operators relative to that of clerks and workers in craft
and related trades. All of these variables have related measurement problems, particularly for
the developing countries, where some employment is informal and is not recorded in official
statistics. Still, by looking at the various dimensions of the data, we hope to get a general picture.
The results in Table XIII are consistent across specifications and reveal no evidence that
the regulation of labor is beneficial. An increase of the employment laws index by 1 point (from
New Zealand to Spain) raises the share of the unofficial economy in GDP by 6.72 percentage
points, the share of unofficial employment by 13.74 percentage points, and reduces labor force
participation of men and women by about 3 percentage points. It also raises the average
unemployment rate by nearly 3 percentage points, and that of young men by over 6 and young
women by nearly 10 percentage points. The adverse effects of regulation are only slightly
weaker for industrial relations laws, but are generally insignificant for social security laws.
In addition to the especially large effects of the regulation of labor on the unofficial
economy and the unemployment of the young, Table XIII shows that heavier regulation is also
associated with higher wages of machine operators relative to those of clerks. These results
suggest indirectly that the older workers, employed in official sector and protected by the law,
26

are the likely beneficiaries of regulation. The costs of the regulation are borne
disproportionately by the younger workers, and those employed in the unofficial economy. The
heavier regulation of labor thus has its own political base: the older and better protected workers,
a finding broadly consistent with other research in labor economics (Blanchflower and Freeman
2000).
Table XIV addresses the concern that labor laws are endogenous, and presents
instrumental variables regressions using legal origins as instruments. With the exception of the
results on the informal economy, which loose significance, the effect of employment laws on
outcomes becomes stronger. The fact that the exogenous component of labor laws reduces labor
force participation and raises unemployment is strong evidence against the efficiency theory.
The results on outcomes point to a possible role of politics in shaping the patterns of
labor regulation. It remains the case that the most pervasive determinant of these patterns is the
origin of a country’s laws. But employment protection and industrial relations laws also appear
to affect different classes of workers differently, and as such may create a basis of political
support for the politicians who expand them. Our finding that leftist parties in French civil law
countries introduce more protective labor laws is consistent with this interpretation.

VII. Conclusion
There are three broad theories of government regulation of labor. Efficiency theories
hold that regulations adjust to most efficiently address the problems of market failure. Political
theories hold that regulations are used by the political leaders to benefit themselves and their
allies. Legal theories hold that the patterns of regulation are shaped by each country’s legal

27

tradition, which is to a significant extent determined by transplantation of a few legal systems.
We examined the regulation of labor markets in 85 countries through the lens of these theories.
The evidence is inconsistent with the efficiency theory since, contrary to its predictions,
poor countries regulate labor markets more than rich countries do, social security is not a
substitute for labor regulation, and such regulation has adverse consequences for unemployment,
labor force participation, and economic activity staying official. The evidence is also
inconsistent with a basic version of the political theory, which sees heavier regulation of labor as
a reflection of the political power of the left through either elected office or labor unions.
Although our measures of the power of the left, as well as our measures of political and
economic constraints on government, influence the patterns of regulation of labor, these effects
disappear once we control for the basic regulatory style determined by the legal tradition.
Finally, the evidence is broadly consistent with the legal theory, according to which patterns of
regulation across countries are shaped largely by their legal structure, which arrived to most
countries through transplantation of legal systems.
These results do not mean that efficiency forces in regulation are unimportant, and indeed
our focus on labor markets and on a large sample of developing countries, which inherited their
regulatory styles, predisposes our findings against supporting the efficiency hypothesis. These
findings also do not mean that politics is unimportant, except to the extent that they reject the
view that civil law is nothing but a reflection of “social democracy”. Indeed, we show that
politics do influence the intensity of labor market regulation in French civil law countries, where
the basic regulatory style is vulnerable to political pressures. We also present some indirect
evidence that the older workers, and those more likely to be covered by the laws, are the likely

28

beneficiaries, and hence political supporters, of labor regulation. But politics plays the second
fiddle; the main determinant of the regulatory style is the historical origin of a country’s laws.
This finding echoes our earlier results on the regulation of entry and on the formalism of
judicial procedures. These findings also showed that countries from different legal origins rely
on different institutional technologies for social control of business. A key result in the present
paper is the high correlation among our measures of regulation of different activities across
countries: countries that regulate entry also regulate labor markets and judicial proceedings. The
bottom line of this research is the centrality of institutional transplantation: countries have
regulatory styles that are pervasive across activities and shaped by the origin of their laws.

Table I
Description of the variables
The table describes the variables in the paper. Unless otherwise specified, the sources for the variables are the laws of each country.
Variable

Description

Employment laws
Alternative employment contracts
Part-time employment is
prohibited

We define a ‘part-time worker’ as any employee working 20 hours per week. It includes people working 4
hours per day 5 days per week, and people working full time two and a half days per week. The second case
is frequently known as a ‘temporary worker’. This variable equals one if part-time employment is prohibited
by the labor laws. Equals zero if part-time work is expressly allowed or if labor laws are silent thereon.

Part-time workers are not exempt Equals one if a part-time worker working half the time of a full-time worker enjoys at least half of the benefits
from mandatory benefits of full- enjoyed by the full-time worker. The variable is also equal to one if part-time employment is prohibited by
time workers
the labor laws. The variable equals zero if part-time workers are not entitled to: (i) at least half of the
maximum hours of work, leaves, and overtime premiums; (ii) social security coverage (pensions, health,
unemployment); or (iii) if there are entitlement thresholds of more than half the legally mandated regular work
week for premiums, leaves, or social security coverage. In countries where there are minimum-earnings
thresholds to obtain benefits (rather than time-based thresholds), the analysis is done considering a salary
equal to half of the country's GNP per worker.
It is not easier or less costly to
Equals one if part-time workers working half time enjoy at least half of the legal rights to advance notice and
terminate part-time workers than separation fees for the termination of the employment contract of full time workers. Equals zero otherwise.
full-time workers
Part-time contracts

Measures the protection of part-time workers in the labor law as the average of the preceding three variables.

Fixed-term contracts are only
allowed for fixed-term tasks

The term ‘fixed-term contract’ refers to workers employed for fixed periods of weeks, months, or years. In
many countries a person working for two or three days per week is considered a fixed-term, rather than a parttime, worker. This variable equals one if fixed-term contracts are allowed only: (i) for jobs that are temporary
by nature; (ii)for temporary vacancies to replace a permanent worker in maternity or sickness leave; (iii)for
training contracts; (iv) for seasonal work; and/or (v) if the law expressly states that the will of the parties
involved in the contract is not a good enough reason for entering into a fixed-term contract. Equals zero
otherwise.

Maximum duration of fixed-term Measures the maximum cumulative duration of fixed-term contracts. The variable is normalized from 0 to
contracts.
1, where higher values mean lower allowed duration of fixed-term contracts (higher protection). If there is
no legally mandated ceiling or if fixed-term contracts may be renewed without limit, the variable equals zero.
The highest observation in our sample is 96 months and the lowest observation is 0 months.
Fixed-term contracts

Measures the protection of workers through limits set in the use of fixed-term contracts as the average of the
preceding two variables.

The employment of family
Equals one if the employment of family members enjoys the protection of labor law, or if labor law is silent
members is not exempt from any regarding family members’ employment. Equals zero if the employment of family members is not subject to
aspect of the labor law
maximum hours of work, leaves, overtime premiums, advance notice and severance payment, social security
coverage, or non-salary benefits. This variable is coded without regard to our assumption on firm size.
Subindex: Alternative
employment contracts

Mandatory minimum daily rest

Measures whether the law allows alternatives to the standard employment contract as the average score of:
(i) part-time contracts; (ii) fixed-term contracts; and (iii) the employment of family members is not exempt
from any aspect of the labor law.
Conditions of employment
Measures the mandatory minimum daily rest. This variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values
mean higher duration of mandatory daily rest (higher protection). If there is no legally mandated ceiling, the
variable equals zero. Legal limits may be defined either as mandatory minimum rest hours per day, or as
mandatory maximum regular and overtime working hours per day. For the latter case, we subtract this number
from 24 hours in a day to obtain the equivalent of the minimum of rest hours per day. The highest observation
in our sample is 14 hours and the lowest observation is 5 hours, excluding the countries that have no limit.

Description

Maximum number of hours in a
regular work week

Measures the maximum duration of the regular work week (excluding overtime). This variable is normalized
from 0 to 1, where higher values mean less hours of work (higher protection). If there is no legally mandated
limit, the variable equals zero. The highest observation in our sample is 52 hours and the lowest observation
is 37 hours.

Premium for overtime work

Measures the premium for overtime work, as defined by the law or mandatory collective agreement. This
variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values mean higher premium (higher protection). If the law
provides for a variable schedule of overtime premium, we code the basic premium for the first hour of
overtime. The highest observation in our sample is 100% and the lowest observation is 0%.

There are restrictions on night
work

Equals one if by law or mandatory collective agreement: (i) there are restrictions on the maximum number
of hours of work that can be performed at night; and/or (ii) if there are specific premiums for night-time work.
Equals zero if night-time work is not subject to express limitations, i.e., if it is only subject to the general
restrictions on the maximum length of the work day or work week, and the regular overtime premium. To
code this variable we only consider specific regulations of night-time work and ignore regulations of workshifts.

There are restrictions on "weekly Equals one if by law or mandatory collective agreement there are restrictions on work during the weekly
holiday" work
holiday (Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, depending on the country). Restrictions include: (i) complete
prohibition; (ii) express designation of a certain day of the week as weekly holiday, which the employer
cannot change without workers' consent; (iii) specific maximum hours of work on such day; and (iv) special
premiums for work on such day. Equals zero if work during the weekly holiday is: (i) allowed without
restriction; or (ii) is only subject to the general limitations on the maximum length of the work week or work
day and does not entail higher than regular overtime premiums.
Hours of work

Measures the protection of the regulation of hours of work as the average of the preceding five variables.

Days of annual leave with pay in Measures the length of the annual paid leave in manufacturing after twenty years of employment. This
manufacturing
variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values mean longer annual paid leave (higher protection).
Equals zero if there is no minimum by law or mandatory collective agreement. If annual leave entails less
than full pay, the number of days are discounted proportionally. The highest observation in our sample is 30
days and the lowest is 0 days. We assume that 7 calendar days equal 5 working days.
Paid time-off for holidays is
mandatory

Equals one if workers are granted paid time off for national or local holidays by law or mandatory collective
agreement. Equals zero otherwise.

Statutory duration of maternity
leave with 100% earnings

Measures the length of the statutory duration of maternity leave for normal delivery/birth of a normal child
with 100% of earnings. The variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values mean longer maternity
leave (higher protection). Equals zero if maternity leave is unpaid. If payment is less than 100%, time is
reduced proportionally. The highest observation in our sample is 12 months and the lowest observation is 0
months. Source: ILO, Conditions of Work Digest, 1994.

Leaves

constitution
constitution. Equals one if a right to certain minimum conditions of employment is expressly granted by the
constitution. Equals 0.67 if the minimum conditions of employment are described as a matter of public policy
or public interest in the constitution (or mentioned within the chapter on rights). Equals 0.33 if conditions
of employment are otherwise mentioned in the constitution. Equals zero otherwise.
Subindex: Conditions of
employment

Measures the protection in the law of conditions of employment as the average of: (i) hours of work; (ii)
leaves; (iii) mandatory minimum wage; and (iv) conditions of employment in the constitution.

Variable

It is unfair to terminate the
employment contract without
cause

Description

Job security
Measures the parties' leeway to agree on the conditions of termination of the employment contract. Equals
one: (i) if the employer may not terminate the employment contract without cause; (ii) if the termination
without cause always entails a mandatory penalty; or (iii) if the law bans the parties to enter into employment
contracts that may be terminated by either party entirely at will or with a simple advance notice without any
mandatory penalty. Equals zero otherwise.

the prohibition.
The employer must notify a third Equals one if, by law or mandatory collective agreement, the employer must notify a third party (labor union,
party prior to a collective
workers' council, government agency) before dismissing more than one worker. Equals zero if the employer
dismissal
may dismiss more than one worker without notifying a third party, or if the employer may contract out of the
prohibition.
The employer needs the approval Equals one if, by law or mandatory collective agreement, the employer needs the approval of a third party
of a third party prior to a
(labor union, workers' council or government agency) prior to a collective (more than one worker) dismissal.
collective dismissal
Equals zero if the employer may dismiss more than one worker without third party approval, or if the
employer may contract out of the prohibition.

Equals one if, by law or mandatory collective agreement, the employer must provide relocation or retraining
alternatives for redundant employees prior to dismissal. Equals zero otherwise.

There are priority rules applying Equals one if, by law or mandatory collective agreement, there are priority rules applying to dismissal or layto dismissal or lay-offs
offs, i.e., in order to fire redundant employees, the employer must follow a specific order of seniority, marital
status, number of dependants or other objective priority criteria. Equals zero otherwise.
There are priority rules applying Equals one if, by law or mandatory collective agreement, there are priority rules applying to re-employment.
to re-employment
Equals zero if former redundant employees need not be considered for new positions (i.e. there are no priority
rules for re-employment).
Protection of dismissal
procedures

Measures the protection of collective dismissal procedures as the average of the preceding seven variables.

Legally mandated notice period

Measures the length of the mandatory notice period for the dismissal of one redundant worker in
manufacturing after twenty years of employment. The variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values
mean longer notice (higher protection). Equals zero if there is no minimum notice period by law. The highest
observation in our sample is 24 weeks and the lowest is 0 weeks.

Legally mandated severance
payment

Measures the amount of mandatory severance payment (including mandatory indemnity) for the dismissal of
one redundant worker after twenty years of employment in manufacturing. The variable is normalized from
0 to 1, where higher values mean higher amounts (higher protection). Equals zero if there is no severance
payment by law. The highest observation in our sample is 28.5 months and the lowest is 0 months.
Measures the protection of the notice period and the severance payment for the unilateral termination of the
employment contract by the employer. This partial subindex is calculated as the average of the preceding two
variables.

Notice and severance payment

Variable

Description

Right to job security in the
constitution

Measures the presence of rules on termination of the employment contract in the country's constitution.
Equals one if a right to job security or to the stability in the employment relation is expressly granted by the
constitution. Equals 0.67 if job security is described as a matter of public policy or public interest (or
mentioned within the chapter on rights). Equals 0.33 if job security is otherwise mentioned in the constitution.
Equals zero otherwise.

councils or other organizations of workers. Equals zero if employers may lawfully refuse to bargain with
workers. The variable only measures the duty to bargain, as opposed to the duty to bargain in good faith.
Collective contracts are extended Equals one if the law extends collective contracts to third parties at the national or sectoral level. Extensions
to third parties by law
may be automatic or subject to governmental approval. Equals zero if collective contracts may not be
extended to non-signatory workers or unions, or if collective contracts may be extended only at the plant level.
Mandatory administrative extensions of collective contracts are coded as equivalent to mandatory extensions
by law.
Law allows closed shops

Equals one if the law allows closed shops, and zero otherwise. Closed shops are agreements providing for
mandatory union membership, which are binding on non-signatory and new employees. Union security
legislation in general includes the following measures: (1) pre-entry closed shops, where workers have to
belong to a union prior to taking up a job; (2) post-entry closed shops (or union shops), where workers are
forced to join a union after taking up a job; and (3) absolute preferences, where an employer has to give a job
to a union member if equally qualified to another non-union candidate. We do not consider post-entry closed
shops.

Labor union power

Measures the statutory protection of unions as the average of the preceding three variables.

Right to unionization in the
constitution

Measures the protection of the right to form labor unions in the country's constitution. Equals one if a right
to form labor unions is expressly granted by the constitution. Equals 0.67 if labor unions are described as a
matter of public policy or public interest (or mentioned within the chapter on rights). Equals 0.33 if labor
unions are otherwise mentioned in the constitution. Equals zero otherwise.

the constitution. Equals zero otherwise.
Subindex: Collective bargaining Measures the legal protection of the right to unionization and collective bargaining as the average of: (i) labor
union power; (ii) right to unionization in the constitution; and (iii) right to collective bargaining in the
constitution.

Worker participation in management

Variable

Description

Workers and/or unions have a
right to appoint members to the
boards of directors

Equals one if the law gives workers and/or unions the right to appoint members to the Boards of Directors of
individual companies, and zero otherwise. This arrangement is usually associated with the “German” model
of co-determination.

Workers councils are mandated
by law

Equals one if workers councils, committees or equivalent bodies are mandated by law. Equals zero if workers
councils are not regulated by law or if their creation is voluntary for the employer. Workers councils are
institutions of employers and workers created for the discussion of company's policies affecting workers at
the company level. This arrangement is sometimes called the “Swedish” model. The employer still has the
sole right to decide on the operations of the company, but must negotiate and decide all matters affecting
workers within the framework of workers councils.

Worker participation by law

Measures the statutory rights of workers to participate in the management of the companies as the average of
the preceding two variables.

Right to participation in
management in the constitution

Measures the protection of the workers' right to participation in management in the country's constitution.
Equals one if a right to participation in management is expressly granted by the constitution. Equals 0.67 if

worker participation by law; and (ii) right to worker participation in management in the constitution.
Collective disputes

Workers have the right to strike

Equals one if the laws grant workers the right or the freedom to strike, and zero otherwise.

Wildcat strikes are legal

Equals one if wildcat strikes are legal, and zero otherwise. Wildcat strikes are strikes not authorized by the
labor union or the assembly of workers.

Political strikes are legal

Equals one if political strikes are legal, and zero otherwise. Political strikes are defined as strikes for political
reasons or to protest government's policy, i.e., non work-related issues.

Sympathy / solidarity / secondary Equals one if the law allows sympathy, solidarity or secondary strikes used to force decisions affecting
strikes are legal
workers other than those joining the strike, and zero otherwise. Sympathy or solidarity strikes are strikes by
union members or workers who have no grievances against their employer, but who want to show solidarity
with another union or workers. Secondary strikes are those against another employer who has business
dealings with the employer involved in a dispute with the union or workers.
Legal strikes

Measures the protection of the right to strike in the law as the average of the preceding four variables.

No mandatory waiting period or
notification requirement before
strikes can occur

Equals one if by law there is no mandatory waiting period or notification requirement before strikes can occur,
and zero otherwise.

is a collective agreement in force
Laws do not mandate
conciliation procedures before
a strike

Equals one if laws do not mandate conciliation procedures or other alternative-dispute-resolution mechanisms
(other than binding arbitration) before the strike, and zero otherwise.

Procedural restrictions to strikes

Measures the absence of procedural restrictions to the right to strike in the law as the average of the preceding
three variables.

Employer lockouts are not
allowed

Equals one if employers' lockouts (strikes by employers) are not allowed, and zero otherwise. Lockouts may
be offensive (when they are not provoked by workers) or defensive.

Variable

Description

Employers are not allowed to fire Equals one if the law prohibits employers to fire striking workers or to hire replacement labor to maintain the
or replace striking workers
plant in operation during a non-violent and non-political strike. Equals zero otherwise.
Employer defenses

Measures the powers of employers during a collective dispute as the average of the preceding two variables.

Compulsory third party
Equals one if the parties to a labor dispute are legally required to seek third party arbitration or the government
arbitration during a labor dispute is always entitled to impose compulsory arbitration on them. Equals zero otherwise. The term ‘compulsory
is mandated by law
arbitration’ refers to arbitration of private disputes against the will of the parties. It may protect workers by
granting them an alternative to costly strikes in case of deadlocks in the negotiation process, but it may also
limit the workers’ right to strike.
Right to industrial action in the
constitution

Measures the protection of the right to industrial action (i.e. strike, go-slow or work-to-rule) in the country's
constitution. It equals one a right to industrial action is expressly granted by the constitution. Equals 0.67
if strikes are described as a matter of public policy or public interest (or mentioned within the chapter on
rights). Equals 0.33 if strikes are otherwise mentioned in the constitution. Equals zero otherwise.

Subindex: Collective disputes

Measures the protection of workers during a collective dispute as the average of: (i) legal strikes; (ii)
procedural restrictions to strikes; (iii) employer defenses; (iv) compulsory third party arbitration during a labor
dispute; and (v) right to industrial action in the constitution.

Index: Industrial (collective)
relations laws

Measures the protection of industrial (collective) relations laws as the sum of the: (i) subindex of collective
bargaining; (ii) subindex of worker participation in management; and (iii) subindex of collective disputes.
Social security laws
Old age, disability and death benefits

The Social Security system
covers the risk of old age,
disability and death

Equals one if the social security system covers the risk of old age, disability and death, and zero otherwise.

Difference between retirement
age and life expectancy

Measures the difference between the minimum legal age for normal retirement and the country's life
expectancy at birth. This variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values mean higher post-retirement
life expectancy (higher protection). Normal retirement is the legally defined age for retirement with standard
pension, and it excludes voluntary early or late retirement schemes. Equals zero if life expectancy is lower
than retirement age. The highest observation in our sample is 23.8 years and the lowest is 0 years. Source:
constructed using data from the laws of each country and the Human Development Report, 1997.

Months of contributions or
Measures the number of months of contributions or employment legally required for normal retirement. The
employment required for normal variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values mean less contribution (higher protection). The
retirement by law
highest observation in our sample is 540 months and the lowest is 0 months. Normal retirement is the legally
defined age for retirement with standard pension, and it excludes voluntary early or late retirement schemes.
If the law requires the worker to have a combination of certain number of months of work and a different
number of months of contributions, we use the higher of the two figures since this is the one that is binding.
Lump-sum and private pension systems do not define the number of months of contributions for normal
retirement by law. In such cases, the amount of the pension solely depends on the number of months of
contributions, thus we assume twenty years of contributions for normal retirement.
Percentage of the worker's
monthly salary deducted by law
to cover old-age and disability
benefits

Measures the share of the worker's monthly salary deducted by law to cover old-age, disability, and death
benefits. The variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values mean lower deductions (higher
protection). If the risk of disability and death is not included in the contribution for old-age pension, we add
the individual components. The highest observation in our sample is 20% and the lowest is 0%. In some
countries the social security contribution for old age, disability and death benefits also covers sickness and
health benefits and/or unemployment benefits. In such cases, we calculate the share of contributions for each
benefit for the average country in our sample, and apportion the total contribution among the several risks
covered accordingly.

Variable

Description

Percentage of the pre-retirement
salary covered by the old-age
cash-benefit pension

This variable is the equivalent to the "replacement rate", which is the percentage of the pre-retirement salary
covered by the average old-age cash-benefit pension. The variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher
values mean higher percentage (higher protection). The highest observation in our sample is 90% and the
lowest is 0%. For the countries that provide workers more than 12 pension payments a year, we add up the
amount of all the payments and divided the total by 12 to get the equivalent "monthly" cash benefit pension.
Where the pension plan provided for fixed monthly payments, rather than a percentage, the replacement rate
is calculated using a pre-retirement salary equal to the country's GNP per worker. For lump-sum systems,
where at the time of retirement a one-time payment is made equal to the worker's contributions plus accrued
interest, the monthly old-age cash-benefit pension is calculated using the lump-sum payment divided by the
difference between the average life expectancy and retirement age in months. As in the case of fixed monthly
payment systems, the pre-retirement salary is calculated to be equal to the country's GNP per worker. The
interest used in the calculation is the average monthly Libor rate over the previous ten years. The same
methodology as in the lump-sum systems is applied to the private pension systems. If there are more than 12
pension payments per year we adjust the percentage accordingly.

Subindex: Old age, disability
and death benefits

Measures the level of old age, disability and death benefits as the average of the preceding four variables.
Sickness and health benefits

The social security system
covers the risk of sickness

Equals one if the social security system covers the risk of sickness and zero otherwise.

Months of contributions or
employment required to qualify
for sickness benefits by law

Measures the number of months of contributions or employment legally required to qualify for sickness
benefits. The variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values mean less contribution (higher
protection). If the law requires the worker to have a combination of certain number of months of work and
a different number of months of contributions, we use the higher of the two figures since this is the one that
is binding. The highest observation in our sample is 12 months and the lowest is 0 months.

Percentage of the worker's
monthly salary deducted by law
to cover sickness and health
benefits

Measures the share of the worker's monthly salary deducted by law to cover sickness and health benefits. The
variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values mean lower deductions (higher protection). If the risks
of sickness and health demand separate contributions, we add the individual components. The highest
observation in our sample is 11.8% and the lowest observation is 0%. In some countries the social security
contribution for old age, disability and death benefits also covers sickness and health benefits and/or
unemployment benefits. In such cases, we calculate the share of contributions for each benefit for the average
country in our sample, and apportion the total contribution among the several risks covered accordingly.

Waiting period for sickness
benefits

Measures the waiting period for obtaining sickness cash benefits from the first day of sickness. The variable
is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values mean lower waiting periods (higher protection). The waiting
period is the number of days before a person is legally entitled to receive sickness benefits. The highest
observation in our sample is 42 days and the lowest observation is 0 days.

Percentage of the salary covered Measures the percentage of the salary covered by the average sickness cash benefit for a two-month sickness
by sickness cash benefits for a
spell. The variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values mean higher percentage of salary covered
two-month sickness spell
(higher protection). If sickness benefits last less than 2 months, the percentage of the salary by sickness
benefits is discounted proportionally. The highest observation in our sample is 100% and the lowest
observation is 0%. Sickness cash benefits are defined in some countries as a fixed amount in local currency,
rather than as a percentage. In such cases, the percentage of the salary covered is calculated based on a salary
equal to the country's GNP per worker.
Subindex: Sickness and health
benefits

Measures the level of sickness and health benefit as the average of the preceding four variables.

Unemployment benefits
The Social Security system
Equals one if the social security system covers the risk of unemployment, and zero otherwise.
covers the risk of unemployment
Months of contributions or
employment required to qualify
for unemployment benefits by
law

Measures the number of months of contributions or employment legally required to qualify for unemployment
benefits. The variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values mean less contribution (higher
protection). If the law requires the worker to have a combination of certain number of months of work and
a different number of months of contributions, we use the higher of the two figures since this is the one that
is binding. The highest observation in our sample is 120 months and the lowest observation is 0 months.

Variable

Description

Percentage of the worker's
monthly salary deducted by
law to cover unemployment
benefits

Measures the share of the worker's monthly salary deducted by law to cover unemployment benefits. The
variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values mean lower deductions (higher protection). The
highest observation in our sample is 6.1% and the lowest observation is 0%. In some countries the social
security contribution for old age, disability and death benefits also covers sickness and health benefits and/or
unemployment benefits. In such cases, we calculate the share of contributions for each benefit for the average
country in our sample, and apportion the total contribution among the several risks covered.

Waiting period for
unemployment benefits

Measures the waiting period for obtaining unemployment benefits from the first day of unemployment. The
variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values mean lower waiting periods (higher protection). The
waiting period is the number of days before a person is legally entitled to receive unemployment benefits. The
highest observation in our sample is 70 days and the lowest observation is 0 days.

Percentage of the salary covered
by unemployment benefits in
case of a one-year
unemployment spell

Measures the percentage of the salary covered by unemployment benefits for in case of a one-year
unemployment spell. The variable is normalized from 0 to 1, where higher values mean higher percentage
of salary (higher protection). If the maximum the duration of benefits is less than one year, the percentage
of the annual salary is discounted proportionally. The highest observation in our sample is 90% and the
lowest observation is 2.78%. Unemployment benefits are defined in some countries as a fixed amount in local
currency, rather than as a percentage. In such cases, the percentage of the salary covered is calculated based
on a salary equal to the country's GNP per worker.

Subindex: Unemployment
benefits

Measures the level of unemployment benefits as the average of the preceding four variables.

Average of dummies on coverage Equals the average of the three dummy variables for the existence of coverage, namely: (i) social security
of old age, sickness and
system covers the risk of old age, disability and death; (ii) social security system covers the risk of sickness
unemployment
and health; and (iii) social security system covers the risk of unemployment.
Index: Social security laws

Measures social security benefits as the sum of the: (i) subindex of old age, disability and death benefits; (ii)
subindex of sickness and health benefits; and (iii) subindex of unemployment benefits.
Left power

Chief Executive's party has left
or center political orientation

Measures the percentage of years between 1975 and 1995 during which the party of the country's chief
executive had left or center orientation. If the country was not independent in the initial year of the period,
we calculate the variable for the number of years since it became independent. For the countries that were
part of a larger country in the initial year of the period and subsequently broke-up, we consider the political
orientation of the larger country until the breakup. In the case of military regimes, where political affiliations
are unclear, we classify the regime based on its policies. Source: Authors’ calculations based on descriptions

Average wages of machine
operators / wages of clerks and
workers in craft and related
trades 1990-1999

Average wages of machine operators across industries over those of clerks and workers in craft and related
trades for the period 1990 to 1999. We use all 12 types of machine operators in the database including: (1)
cloth weaver, (2) sewing-machine operator, (3) clicker cutter, (4) shoe sewer, (5) paper-making-machine
operator, (6) machine compositor, (7) bookbinder, (8) mixing- and blending-machine operator (manufacture
of industrial chemicals), (9) mixing- and blending-machine operator (manufacture of other chemical products),
(10) metal-working machine setter, (11) machinery fitter-assembler and (12) card- and tape-punchingmachine operator. The clerks and workers in craft and related trades we use are: (1) butcher, (2) building
electrician, (3) bricklayer, (4) automobile mechanic and (5) stenographic typist (wholesale trade). To
construct the variable we: (1) calculate individual wage ratios for each pair of machine operators and workers
in craft, related trades and clerks for each year; (2) average each of these ratios across the 1990-1999 period
to obtain the average relative wages for each pair of professions during the decade; finally (3) calculate the
country average across all pairs of professions where machine operators are always the numerator and workers
in craft and related trades or clerks are the denominator. Source: Freeman and Oostendorp [2000].

Court formalism index for the
eviction of a non-paying tenant

The index measures substantive and procedural statutory intervention in judicial cases at lower-level civil trial
courts, and is formed by adding up the following indices: (i) professionals vs. laymen, (ii) written vs. oral
elements, (iii) legal justification, (iv) statutory regulation of evidence, (v) control of superior review, (vi)
engagement formalities, and (vii) independent procedural actions. The index ranges from 0 to 7, where 7
means a higher level of control or intervention in the judicial process. Source: Djankov et al. [2003].

Court formalism index for the
collection of a bounced check

The index measures substantive and procedural statutory intervention in judicial cases at lower-level civil trial
courts, and is formed by adding up the following indices: (i) professionals vs. laymen, (ii) written vs. oral
elements, (iii) legal justification, (iv) statutory regulation of evidence, (v) control of superior review, (vi)
engagement formalities, and (vii) independent procedural actions. The index ranges from 0 to 7, where 7
means a higher level of control or intervention in the judicial process. Source: Djankov et al. [2003].

Ln number of steps to start a
business

Logarithm of the number of different procedures that a start-up has to comply with in order to obtain a legal
status, i.e. to start operating as a legal entity. Source: Djankov et al. [2002].

Ln number of days to start a
business

Logarithm of the time it takes to obtain legal status to operate a firm, in business days. A week has five
business days and a month has twenty two. Source: Djankov et al. [2002].

Ln cost to start a business / GDP Logarithm of the cost of obtaining legal status to operate a firm as a share of per capita GDP in 1999. It
per capita
includes all identifiable official expenses (fees, costs of procedures and forms, photocopies, fiscal stamps,
legal and notary charges, etc). The company is assumed to have a start-up capital of ten times per capita GDP
in 1999. Source: Djankov et al. [2002].

Ordinary least squares regressions of the cross section of countries, excluding all socialist countries. The dependent variables are: (i)
Employment laws in Panel A, and (ii) Industrial relation laws in Panel B. Each regression is separately run for French legal origin and
English legal origin countries. For each pair of regressions, we run a Chow test of the equality of the estimated coefficients for French
and English legal origins. Robust standard errors are shown in parentheses. All the variables are described in Table I and the data can
be found in http://iicg.som.yale.edu/.
