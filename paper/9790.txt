The Impact of Physician Intervention and Tobacco Control Policies on
Average Daily Cigarette Consumption Among Adult Smokers
John A. Tauras and Lan Liang
NBER Working Paper No. 9790
June 2003
JEL No. I1
ABSTRACT
Physicians' advice to stop smoking has been found to increase smoking cessation rates in controlled
clinical trials. However, these finding may not be applicable under real world conditions. This paper
investigates the impact of physicians' advice and tobacco control policies on conditional cigarette
demand among adults employing non-experimental data. Because the data is non-experimental, the
variables reflecting physician advice to stop smoking and cigarette consumption are likely to be
endogenous. We implement a three stage least squares regression technique designed to take account
the joint determination of physician advice and cigarette smoking. The results from these models
imply that smokers that received advice from their physician to quit smoking will decrease their
average daily consumption by between 5-6 cigarettes per day as compared to smoker who do not
receive advice. This result implies that physicians' advice is effective in curtailing smoking in real
world settings. Other policies that were found to decrease average smoking by smokers include: the
real price of cigarettes and clean indoor air laws.

I. Introduction
Cigarette smoking is the single most preventable cause of death and disability in
the United States, responsible for more than 400,000 premature deaths each year (CDC,
1999). Despite the deleterious health effects of cigarette smoking, approximately 47.2
million adults in the United States (U.S.) aged 18 and over were current smokers in 1998,
representing nearly one quarter (24.1%) of the total U.S. adult population (CDC, 2000).
In this paper, we examine the impact of physician advice, cigarette prices, clean
indoor air laws, and state tobacco control spending on the average number of cigarettes
smoked by adult smokers in the United States. It is well established in the medical
literature that physicians acting as educators and facilitators can have a significant effect
on the smoking behavior of their patients (Fiore et al., 1996; Manley, et al., 1991; Kottke,
et al., 1988; Ockene and Zapka, 1997). The efficacy of physician intervention is
important because more than 70% of smokers in the United States have some contact
with a physician each year (Davis, 1988; USDHHS, 1994). Several studies have
concluded that a positive relationship exists between the amount of time a physician
spends counseling their patients and the probability of successful smoking cessation
(Wilson, et al, 1988; Ockene, et al, 1991). Moreover, several studies have found that
additional intervention modalities, such as reminder systems, increase the likelihood of
successful cessation (Cohen, et al. 1989; Ockene, et al. 1991; Wilson, 1988). The
aforementioned findings from the medical literature, however, generally come from
controlled clinical trials. The effect of physician advice in real world settings has yet to
be quantified.

Numerous econometric studies on the determinants of adult cigarette demand
have been published over the past three decades. A vast majority of these studies have
found a strong inverse relationship between cigarette prices or excise taxes and cigarette
consumption.1 Some of these studies have employed individual level data to investigate
adult cigarette demand. The use of individual level data allows researchers to investigate
the impact of individual specific factors, such as physician counseling, on smoking
behavior. In general, the studies that employ individual level data find cigarette prices
and excise taxes to have a negative impact on adult cigarette demand (Lewit and Coate,
1982; Chaloupka, 1991; Chaloupka, 1992; Hu, et al, 1995; Ohsfeldt et al., 1999; Tauras,
2003a; Tauras, 2003b).
To our knowledge, only one published econometric study, conducted by Jones
(1994), has examined the impact of medical advice on smoking behavior. While Jones
(1994) did not control for cigarette prices or other tobacco control policies, he made a
significant contribution to the literature by modeling smoking cessation as a function of
medical advice. Jones includes both medical advice from a physician and medical advice
from anyone else in his smoking cessation equations. Although Jones (1994) found
physician advice to be positively associated with smoking cessation, he found the overall
impact of medical advice to have an anomalous negative effect on smoking cessation.
Econometric studies of cigarette demand have the benefit of employing nonexperimental (i.e. non clinical trial) data in their analysis and are able to shed some light
on the impact of physician advice on smoking behavior in a real world setting. However,

For a comprehensive review of these studies see F.J. Chaloupka and K.E. Warner, “The Economics of
Smoking” in The Handbook of Health Economics (North-Holland, Elsevier Science, 2000) and the various
Surgeon General’s reports (USDHHS, 1989, 1994, and 2000).

since the data are not taken from a controlled clinical trial in which individuals are
randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group, advice provided by physicians
is likely to be endogenous. That is, it may be the case that physicians are more likely to
provide information on the health hazards of smoking or more likely to advise individuals
to cut back or quit smoking to individuals who smoke more on average or exhibit a
smoking related illness.
We are not aware of any previous econometric studies that have examined the
impact of medical advice on average cigarette consumption among smokers. Our study
proposes to address this deficiency in the literature by providing the first examination of
the impact of physician advice on cigarette demand among adult smokers while at the
same time controlling for cigarette prices, tobacco control policies, and a variety of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Due to data limitations, we are not able to
explore the impact of physician advice on actual smoking cessation attempts. In
particular, only smokers are asked about whether or not they visited a physician and
whether or not the physician advised them to quit smoking.
II. Methodology
Theoretical Background
The empirical models of cigarette smoking are based on the economic theory of
demand. In order to derive cigarette demand equations, an individual’s utility function
must first be assumed. This utility function has cigarettes, other goods, and tastes as
arguments. An individual maximizes his or her utility subject to a budget constraint,
which is comprised of the price of cigarettes, income, and the prices of all other goods.
This constrained maximization yields demand functions for cigarettes. The demand

5

functions show that cigarette consumption is related to the price of cigarettes, prices of
related goods, income, and individual’s tastes.
Physicians’ advice to stop smoking and tobacco control policies affect cigarette
demand through what economists call the “full price” of cigarettes. The “full price” of
cigarettes for adults includes not only the monetary price to purchase cigarettes, but also
the costs associated with consuming cigarettes. Therefore, any policy that increases the
monetary price of cigarettes (for example, increased excise taxes) or raises the expected
costs associated with consumption (for example, physicians’ advice, clean indoor air
regulations, and increased anti-smoking sentiment) will increase the “full” price of
cigarettes. According to the law of demand, as the “full” price of a good rises, the
quantity demanded of that good decreases.
Data
The data that are employed in this study are taken from the September 1992,
January 1993, May 1993, September 1995, January 1996, May 1996, September 1998,
January 1999, and May 1999 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population
Survey (CPS), conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Census Bureau.
The CPS is a monthly survey of approximately 50,000 households that has been
conducted for more than fifty years. Representing the civilian non-institutional
population, the CPS focuses on labor force characteristics of the U.S. including
employment, occupation, economic status, earnings, hours worked, and other indicators.
During September 1992, additional questions regarding tobacco use were asked of all
adult respondents as part of the Tobacco Use Supplement to the September 1992 CPS.
Similar questions regarding tobacco use were repeated in the later Tobacco Use

6

Supplements mentioned above. The sample employed in this study consists of a total of
90,790 current adult smokers who visited a physician within one year of being surveyed.
Of those who visited a physician, 49,978 (55.05%) received advice from their physician
to quit smoking. Descriptive statistics of the variables can be found in Table 1.
Of particular importance to this research is the information collected on smokers’
intensity of smoking. For each respondent in the sample, a variable reflecting the average
number of cigarette smoked daily was created. Of equal importance is the information
collected on physician advice. For each respondent, a dichotomous indicator of physician
advice was created. This indicator takes on a value of one if the respondent’s physician
advised him/her to quit smoking and is equal to zero otherwise.
Based on the survey data, numerous independent variables are constructed to
control for other factors thought likely to affect cigarette demand. These factors
included: the age of the respondent in years; gender (male and female–reference
category); family income in 1982-1984 dollars; indicators of race/ethnicity (African
American, Asian, Native American, Black Hispanic, White Hispanic, other Hispanic,
other race, and Caucasian–reference category); indicators of education (less than high
school graduate, vocational school graduate, at least some college, college graduate, and
high school graduate–reference category); indicators of marital status (married spouse
present, married spouse absent, widowed, divorced, separated, and single – reference
category); indicators of metropolitan living (lives within metropolitan area, metropolitan
area not identified, and does not live in metropolitan area – reference category); and
previous week employment status indicators (employed not at work, unemployed, not in
the labor force, employed at work – reference category).

7

In addition, to account for unobserved seasonal and regional heterogeneity,
indicators of U.S. Census Bureau divisions the respondent resides (New England, Mid
Atlantic, East North Central, West North Central, South Atlantic, East South Central,
West South Central, Mountain, and West – reference category) and indicators of season
of data collection (May, September, January – reference category) are created from the
surveys.
Using state identifiers, we merged several tobacco control variables with the
survey data. Cigarette price data were obtained from the annual Tax Burden on Tobacco.
Until 1999, the Tobacco Institute published state level cigarette prices as of November 1.
Since then, Orzechowski and Walker have published the data. These prices are weighted
averages for a pack of 20 cigarettes based on the prices of single packs, cartons, and
vending machine sales where the weights are the national proportions of each type of
sale. These prices are inclusive of state level sales taxes applied to cigarettes but are
exclusive of local cigarette taxes. Because the price published is as of November 1 of
each year and because the dependent variable is based on past month smoking, we
created a weighted average price for each quarter of each year. The average quarterly
price was computed by subtracting state and federal excise taxes from the current year’s
price and the previous year’s price and weighting the pre-tax prices accordingly. Then
the average federal tax and average state tax for each quarter of the year were added to
the quarterly average pretax price. To account for changes in the relative price of
cigarettes over time, all cigarette prices were deflated by the national Consumer Price
Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (1982-1984=100).

8

Using state identifiers, we also merged real state level per capita expenditure on
tobacco control with the survey data. This variable was created by combining real per
capita state specific excise tax funding and other state appropriated funds earmarked for
tobacco control programs with real per capita non governmental state-level expenditures
and per capita tobacco control expenditures from the following national programs:
Americans’ Stop Smoking Intervention Study program (ASSIST), Initiatives to Mobilize
for the Prevention and Control of Tobacco Use (IMPACT), SmokeLess States, and the
Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO). Unfortunately, no
information is available on what types of tobacco control interventions each program
utilizes and how much is spent on each intervention. Thus, the overall state per capita
tobacco control expenditure variable reflects total resources allocated toward tobacco
control in each state.
Based on state identifiers, we also merged clean indoor air laws with the survey
data. Six separate dichotomous indicators representing any restriction on smoking in
private worksites, restaurants, shopping malls, health facilities, public transit facilities,
and grocery/retail stores were created. In addition, to capture the overall magnitude of
each state’s clean indoor air legislation and to decrease the collinearity associated with
including highly correlated state level policies, a clean indoor air index variable was
merged with the surveys. The index variable employs the 6 aforementioned clean indoor
air restrictions, however, each restriction is now allowed to take on a value of between 0
and 3 depending on the strength of protection. That is, if smoking is prohibited, the
restriction rating is 3; if smoking is restricted with separate ventilation, the restriction
rating is 2; if smoking is restricted with no separate ventilation the restriction rating is 1;

9

and if smoking is not restricted, then the restriction rating is 0. The index is derived by
adding up the equally weighted restriction ratings for each of the six restrictions.
We also merged in state-level laws related to youth tobacco access including:
minimum age required to purchase cigarettes, separate dichotomous indicators for states
that restrict youth’s from possessing, using, and purchasing cigarettes, a dichotomous
indicator that restricts cigarette vending machine sales to adult only locations with strict
adult supervision, and a dichotomous indicator for state’s that have created a statewide
enforcement authority to prevent cigarette sales to minors, a dichotomous indicator for
states that require clerks to ask for photo identification from anyone who does not look at
least 21 year of age, and a dichotomous indicator for states that will suspend or revoke an
outlets tobacco license for selling cigarettes to minors.
Empirical Methods
Because the data that is employed in this analysis is non-experimental, the
variables reflecting physician advice to stop smoking and cigarette consumption are
likely to be endogenous. That is, the number of cigarettes a smoker consumes and
whether or not a physician provides advice are likely jointly determined. In particular,
physicians’ advice is likely to influence the number of cigarettes consumed by smokers
while at the same time the number of cigarettes smoked by smokers is likely to influence
whether or not a physician provides advice. In addition, it is possible that important
factors that influence physician advice may be unobservable and these factors may be
related to the error term in the cigarette demand equation. Likewise, it is possible that
factors that influence cigarette demand are unobservable and these factors may be related
to the error term in the physician advice equation.

10

In this paper we estimate the following two equation simultaneous equation
structural model:
C = α 0 + α 1 A + α 2 P + α 3TC A + α 4 X + α 5 R + α 6 S + u1

(1)

A = β 0 + β1C + β 2TCY + β 3TC A + β 4 R + u 2

(2)

where C is the average number of cigarettes consumed daily by smokers, A is a
dichotomous indicator of physician advice, P is the price of cigarettes, TCA is a vector of
tobacco control policies affecting adults, X is a vector of individual characteristics that
are likely to influence cigarette use, TCY is a vector of youth tobacco control policies, R
and S are region and season fixed effects, respectively, and u1 and u2 are error terms that
capture unobservable influences on cigarette consumption and physician advice,
respectively. It is important to note that equation (1) is a behavior equation for smoker
while equation (2) is a behavioral equation for physicians yielding a ceteris paribus
causal relationship.
The joint determination of C and A suggests a correlation between u1 and u2,
resulting in a correlation between A and u1 in equation (1) and a correlation between C
and u2 in equation (2). The correlation between u1 and u2 results in endogeneity bias if
conventional (non instrumental variable) methods are applied to the estimation of
equations (1) and (2).
We employ a three stage least squares (3SLS) estimator to model the
simultaneous equation system. In the first step of 3SLS, each endogenous variable (C
and A) is regressed on all the exogenous variables from both equations (P, TCA, X, TCY,

11

S, and R) using ordinary least squares techniques.2 The predicted values from these
regressions are used as instruments for the endogenous variables. In the second step, the
residuals from a two-stage least squares regression of both structural equations is
employed to obtain consistent estimates of the variance-covariance matrix of the
structural equations’ disturbances. Finally, in the third step, Generalized Least Squares
estimation employing the variance-covariance matrix estimated in stage 2 and the
instruments developed in stage 1 is performed. For a complete discussion, see Zellner
and Theil (1962).
Since equation (1) is of most interest, it is important to discuss the exclusion
restrictions of this equation. In particular, it is assumed that tobacco control policies that
affect only youth (minors) influence the probability of physicians providing advice to
patients, but are not direct determinants of conditional cigarette demand among adults
(non-minors). This specification of adult cigarette demand is consistent with previous
economic research that omits youth tobacco laws when estimating adult demand
equations. Equation (2) also implies a set of exclusion restrictions. In particular, once
the amount of cigarette consumed and unobserved regional factors, such as tobacco
sentiment, are controlled for, individual characteristics and seasonality are assumed to
have no direct affect on physicians’ decisions to provide advice.
III. Results
Table 2 presents the results from several alternative specifications. Model 1
employs separate ordinary least squares (OLS) equations for conditional cigarette
2

Note: Given the large sample size that is employed, the linear probability model used to estimate
physician advice (a binary dependent variable) yields very similar results to non-linear probability models
such as logit and probit methods.

12

demand and physician advice that do not account for endogeneity. The determinants of
cigarette demand include: physician advice, real cigarette price, real per capita
expenditure on tobacco control, six dichotomous clean indoor air restrictions, education,
family income, gender, race, age, marital status, metropolitan status, employment, and
seasonality and region fixed effects. The determinants of physician advice include:
average daily cigarette consumption, nine separate laws that restrict the availability of
cigarettes to minors, real per capita expenditure on tobacco control, six dichotomous
clean indoor air restrictions, and region fixed effect to account for unobserved regional
heterogeneity in anti-smoking counseling of physicians.
Models 2 and 3 employ Three Stage Least Squares methods to model the
simultaneous equation system. Model 2 contains the same regressors as Model 1 to
estimate the conditional demand and physician advice equations, whereas Model 3
replaces the six dichotomous clean indoor air restrictions with a clean indoor air index
variable, but is otherwise the same as Model 2. Model 3 is designed to capture the
overall magnitude of clean indoor air laws on cigarette demand and minimizes the
collinearity resulting from the inclusion of a group of highly correlated measures of clean
indoor air restrictions.
The model that ignores the endogeneity of physician advice results is a
counterintuitive impact of physician advice on adult cigarette demand. That is, in Model
1, physician advice to stop smoking is found to have a positive and highly significant
impact on the average number of cigarettes smoked by smokers. In both models that
correct for endogeneity, physician advice to stop smoking has the a priori expected
negative sign and significance.

13

To confirm that physician advice is in fact endogenous we estimate a reduced
form equation of physician advice and obtain the residuals. We then add the reduced
form residuals to the structural cigarette demand equation and test for the significance of
the residuals using ordinary least squares methods. As suspected the residuals are highly
significant implying that physician advice is indeed endogenous. A similar procedure
was employed to evaluate the endogeneity of daily smoking intensity in equation (2).
The residuals from a reduced form smoking intensity equation were found not to be
statistically significant from zero at conventional levels when added to the physician
advice structural equation. Although this is not a surprising finding given the similarities
in the smoking intensity coefficients between the OLS and Three Stage Least Squares
physician advice equations. Because exogeneity of physician advice is rejected, the
remainder of the paper will focus on the results of Models 2 and 3.
Given that the simultaneous equation systems are identified through exclusion
restrictions, it is important to make sure that we have identified important determinants of
physician advice and smoking intensity in the first stage regressions. We use Wald tests
to check the null hypotheses that the set of excluded variables are simultaneously equal to
zero in the first stage regressions. As you will recall 8 dichotomous tobacco control
policies that affect only minors are excluded from the adult cigarette demand equations.
A Wald test supports the joint significance of these eight youth smoking laws in the first
stage regression of physician advice. The Wald statistics distributed chi-squared with 8
degrees of freedom are significant at better than the .0001 level in both Models 2 and 3.
Similarly, as you will recall, individual characteristics, seasonality, and price are
excluded from the physician advice equations. A Wald test checks the joint significance

14

of these variables in the first stage regressions of smoking intensity. The Wald statistics
distributed chi-squared with 27 degrees of freedom are significant at better than the .0001
level in both Models 2 and 3. The results from the first stage regressions of physician
advice and smoking intensity are presented in Table 3.
Conditional Cigarette Demand Results
The simultaneous equation results support the hypothesis that physician advice to
quit smoking decreases average smoking among individuals who continue to smoke. The
finding that physicians’ advice is inversely related to smoking is consistent with the
medical literature from controlled clinical trial, and more importantly, suggests that
physicians’ advice to quit smoking is effective in reducing cigarette consumption in real
world settings. Our findings imply that holding other determinants of demand constant,
smokers whose physicians advise them to quit smoking smoke between 5.74 and 5.97
fewer cigarettes a day than smokers who do not receive advice from a physician to quit
smoking. Given that the average number of cigarettes smoked among smokers in our
sample is 16.89, our results imply that physicians advice to quit smoking decreases the
average number of cigarettes consumed daily by smokers by approximately one-third.
The real price of cigarettes is found to have a negative and statistically significant
impact on the average number of cigarettes smoked by smokers. The estimated price
elasticity of conditional cigarette demand for Models 2 and 3 are -0.142 and -0.112,
respectively. These estimates imply that a 10% increase in the real price of cigarettes
would decrease the average amount of cigarettes consumed by adult smokers by between
1.1% and 1.4%. The estimated conditional demand elasticities are consistent with those
found in other studies of adult smokers. For example, Lewit and Coate (1982) and Evans

15

and Farrelly (1998) estimated average conditional price elasticities for adults of -0.103
and -0.117, respectively.
Laws that restrict smoking in private worksites and public transportation have a
negative and significant impact on average daily smoking among adult smokers.
However, laws that restrict smoking in health facilities, restaurants, grocery/retail stores,
and shopping malls seem to have an anomalous positive impact on the conditional
demand of smokers. It is plausible that the anomalous estimates are a result of the clean
indoor air laws being highly correlated with one another. The clean indoor air laws that
are employed in this study are enacted at the state level and it is likely that when states
implement or enhance tobacco control programs they enact several clean indoor air
restrictions at the same time. In an attempt to assess the magnitude of the collinearity,
each of the clean indoor air laws was regressed on the remaining clean indoor air laws
and the region fixed effects using ordinary least squares methods. The coefficients of
determination from these regressions implied that 70%, 64%, 58%, 49%, 43%, and 41%
of the variation in grocery store laws, restaurant laws, private workplace laws, shopping
center laws, health facility laws, and transportation laws, respectively, could be explained
by the remaining smoke free air laws and region dummies. These results suggest that
moderate collinearity exists and is likely impacting the results.
In an attempt to examine the overall impact of clean indoor air laws on adult
conditional demand and to mitigate the collinearity of including correlated regressors,
Model 3 replaces the dichotomous clean indoor air indicators with the clean indoor air
index variable described above. The index variable has a negative and significant impact
on average daily consumption among adults. These results clearly indicate that more

16

comprehensive smoke-free air laws will decrease the average number of cigarettes
smoked by adult smokers.
Real state-level per-capita spending on tobacco control programs is found to have
an insignificant impact on conditional cigarette demand among adults in Models 2 and 3.
Although this finding does not adhere to our a priori expectation, the results are quite
plausible given that a large proportion of these funds are used for youth smoking
prevention.
Briefly reviewing the estimates for the other independent variables included in the
conditional cigarette demand equations: Smokers who live in the Western census division
smoke significantly less per day than the remaining 8 divisions, accept for the Mountain
division in Model 3 which is not significant; Smokers smoke statistically fewer cigarette
per day on average in January as compared to May and September – this is consistent
with many smokers making attempts to quit or decrease the quantity of cigarettes smoked
as part of a New Year’s Resolution; A strong inverse relationship if found between
education and average quantity smoked among smokers; Smokers with higher family
incomes smoke less on average than smokers with lower family incomes. This suggests
that smoking is an economically inferior behavior; Smokers who reside in metropolitan
areas smoke fewer cigarettes than do smokers in non metropolitan areas; Age and
conditional smoking are positively related; Smokers who are divorced, separated, or
married smoke more on average than do single smokers; Male smokers smoke more than
female smokers; Caucasians smokers smoke more on average than smokers from any
other racial group; Smokers who are unemployed, not in the labor force, or absent from

17

work in the prior week smoke more on average than smokers who worked in the prior
week.
Physician Advice Results
The simultaneous equation results support the hypothesis that physicians are
significantly more likely to advise smokers who smoke more on average to quit smoking
than smokers who smoke fewer cigarettes per day.
In general, physicians who practice in states that have stronger youth tobacco
laws are more likely to advise their patients who smoke to quit smoking. That is,
physicians are more likely to advise their patients who smoke to quit in states that have:
established an agency to address youth tobacco consumption; implemented purchase,
possession, and use laws; have established higher minimum purchase age requirements;
and require photo identification of individual who look at least 21 years old3.
Physicians who practice in states that spend more per capita on comprehensive
tobacco control programs are significantly more likely to advise their patients to quit
smoking than are physicians who practice in states that spend less per capita on tobacco
control. Given the estimated strong inverse relationship between physician advice and
average smoking, these results imply that states that spend more per capita on tobacco
control have an indirect impact on adult smoking through physicians’ advice.
Individually, the dichotomous clean indoor air laws are found not to be
statistically different from zero at the 5% level of a two-tailed test when predicting
physician advice. However, when the extent of each restriction is taken into account and
3

Note: minor purchase law is only significant at the 11% significance level (two-tail) in Model 2 and the
minimum purchase age is significant at 8% significance level (two tail) in Model 3.

18

aggregated into an index variable, the overall magnitude of clean indoor air laws is found
to have a positive and significant impact of physician’ delivering smoking cessation
advice to smokers.
With respect to regional differences in physicians providing advice, physicians
who practice in the New England, Mid Atlantic, and East North Central divisions are
more likely to provide advice to quit smoking than physicians who practice in the
Western division4. Moreover, physicians who practice in the West North Central, East
South Central, West South Central, and Mountain divisions are less likely to advise their
patients to quit than physicians who practice in the Western division.5
IV. Discussion
Physicians’ advice to stop smoking has been found to increase smoking cessation
rates in controlled clinical trials. However, these finding may not be applicable under
real world conditions. In fact, the only published study, that we are aware of, that
examined the impact of physicians’ advice on smoking behavior that employed nonexperimental data found medical advice not to be a strong predictor of smoking cessation
(Jones, 1994).
Our paper attempts to inform the debate by using non-experimental data to
estimate the impact of physicians’ advice on the conditional cigarette demand of adults.
Physician advice was found to be an endogenous explanatory variable, and if the
endogeneity was not controlled for, anomalous results were found. That is, physicians’
advice has a positive and highly significant impact on the average number of cigarettes

4
5

Note: Mid Atlantic is only significant at the 10% significance level (two-tail test) in Model 2.
Note: Mountain is only significant at the 10% significance level (one-tail test) in Model 3.

smoked by smokers. When we control for endogeneity using a simultaneous equation
system, physician advice is found to have a negative and significant impact on average
smoking by adult smokers. The results from these models imply that smokers who
continue to smoke that received advice from their physician to quit smoking will decrease
their average daily consumption by between 5-6 cigarettes per day as compared to
smoker who do not receive advice. Other policies that were found to decrease average
smoking by smokers include: the real price of cigarettes (which can easily be increased
through the use of cigarette excise taxes) and clean indoor air laws.
