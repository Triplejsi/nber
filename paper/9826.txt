What Do People Buy When They Don’t Buy Health Insurance And
What Does that Say about Why They Are Uninsured?

NBER Working Paper No. 9826
July 2003
JEL No. Z1
ABSTRACT
Using data from the 1994 through 1998 Consumer Expenditure Surveys, we compare household
spending on 16 different goods (food at home, food away from home, housing, transportation,
alcohol and tobacco, interest, furniture and appliances, home maintenance, clothing, utilities,
medical care, health insurance, entertainment, personal care, education, and other) for insured versus
uninsured households, controlling for total expenditures and demographic characteristics. The
analysis shows that the uninsured in the lowest quartile of the distribution of total expenditures
spend more on housing, food at home, alcohol and tobacco, and education than do the insured. In
contrast, households in the top quartile of the distribution of total expenditures spend more on
transportation and furniture and appliances than do comparable insured households. These results
are consistent with the idea that poor uninsured households face higher housing prices than do poor
insured households. Further research is necessary to determine whether high housing prices can
help explain why some households do not have insurance.

1. Introduction
Surprisingly little research has used an economic framework to analyze why some
households do not have health insurance. Most of the literature on the uninsured emphasizes the
demographic characteristics of the uninsured, rather than the economic constraints and choices
that determine coverage. Since the purchase of health insurance is voluntary, coverage represents
a tradeoff for households between insurance and other goods. The economics of this tradeoff are
governed by income, prices and preferences. In this framework, understanding why people are
uninsured means knowing to what extent each of these factors is responsible for the failure to
purchase insurance.
The design of appropriate public policy toward the uninsured depends critically on
understanding the relative importance of these three factors. Suppose, for example, that the main
reason some households do not have health insurance is that their incomes are low and they place
basic needs like food and shelter ahead of health insurance. The debate about covering the
uninsured in this situation is fundamentally one about equity and redistribution; there is no
market failure. If government intervention is called for, the appropriate policy response is to
redistribute resources to the poor through either cash or in-kind transfers.
Alternatively, suppose that most of the uninsured do not buy insurance because
information asymmetries in the insurance market mean that they face actuarially unfair prices.
Government intervention that corrects this market failure will increase social welfare. This
inefficiency can be addressed using the same regulatory tools that are applied to the market for
automobile insurance: mandates to purchase coverage combined with government-sponsored
pools to insure high-risk individuals. Proposals to mandate coverage also typically include

1

subsidies to low-income households, suggesting that policymakers believe some combination of
prices and incomes to be responsible for the lack of health insurance coverage.
Another way in which price differences may help explain lack of insurance coverage is if
the uninsured face higher prices than the insured for other goods. For example, suppose that
some households face higher housing prices than do others. If housing is inelastically demanded
with respect to its own price, spending on housing will increase in response to higher housing
prices. This price increase will also reduce spending on health insurance if the compensated
cross-price elasticity is either negative or positive but smaller than the income effect associated
with the price increase: that is, the two goods may be gross complements. To put it even more
simply, the high cost of housing may squeeze health insurance out of the household’s budget. If
this is the reason why some households are uninsured, it is not obvious what policy response is
most appropriate. Clearly, regulation of health insurance markets misses the point. Income
redistribution or policies directed at the housing market would be more likely to affect the
number of uninsured in this case.
If prices and income cannot explain why some households do not have insurance, the
only remaining explanation that economists have to offer is that preferences must differ. For
example, one explanation for the fact that some households buy health insurance and some do
not is differences in risk aversion. Households may also differ in their preferences for other
goods; some households may choose private schools for their children, annual family vacations,
or nicer homes over having health insurance. If differences in preferences are responsible for
variations in insurance coverage, it is not clear that any policy intervention is justified.1
Moreover, it can be difficult to distinguish differences in preferences from differences in prices.

2

For example, is living in a city and facing high housing prices as a result a reflection of
preferences, or an exogenous difference in prices? Stigler and Becker (1977) have argued that it
is, in general, impossible to distinguish analytically between these two possibilities; any
hypothesized difference in preferences can be modeled as a difference in prices. Therefore we
should consider carefully any reasonable explanation that relies on income or prices to explain
variation in insurance coverage, relying on differences in preferences only as the explanation of
last resort.
Our goal in this paper is to provide preliminary evidence on the relative importance of
income, prices, and preferences in explaining the fact that some households are uninsured. We
begin by showing that even within quite narrow income categories, the fraction of households
purchasing insurance is seldom close to either one or zero. We conclude that income cannot be
the whole story for why some households are uninsured.
To shed light on whether prices or preferences can explain the remaining variation in
insurance coverage, we compare the consumption patterns of uninsured households to those of
insured households with similar total expenditures and other characteristics. The logic behind
this exercise is that we can infer from these patterns how prices facing the insured and uninsured
would have to differ if they were to explain the observed differences in spending between the
two groups and assess whether the hypothesized price differences seem plausible. Moreover,
while the prices individual households face are difficult to observe directly, we have very good
data on household spending patterns.
Our comparison of spending patterns reveals that uninsured households, on average,
spend more than comparable insured households on transportation, furniture and appliances,

An exception is when we believe there are significant externalities associated with the lack of insurance. In this
case, as above, some combination of mandates and subsidies would address the externality without imposing unfair

education, and alcohol and tobacco. Since most uninsured households are low income, more
interesting results emerge when we compare insured versus uninsured households in the bottom
quartile of the expenditure distribution.2 Uninsured households in this group devote significantly
more of their budgets than do the insured to housing, food at home, education, and alcohol and
tobacco. As we will explain in more detail later, these results are consistent with the idea that the
uninsured face higher prices for these goods, in particular housing. Moreoever, controlling for
homeownership – which is likely to be a proxy for housing prices – cuts the uninsured
differential in housing spending in half, lending further support to the idea that the uninsured
may face higher housing prices than the insured.
Returning to the question we posed at the outset: do income, prices or preferences explain
the fact that some households do not have health insurance? Clearly, income matters: health
insurance is a normal good. But it is not the only thing that matters. Our analysis of spending
patterns suggests that the prices of other goods – most notably housing – may be additional
important factors causing some households not to purchase health insurance. In future work, we
plan to use data on housing prices to quantify more precisely the magnitude of this effect relative
to the effect of income or preferences, in order to help inform public policy. Our results in this
paper suggest that policies focusing only on the market for health insurance may be insufficient
to address the problem of the uninsured.

costs on low-income households.

We use total expenditures, rather than income, to describe households’ economic status because expenditures are
likely to be a better measure of permanent income than is annual income (for further discussion of this issue, see
Rogers and Gray [1994]).

2. Background
There is a considerable literature on the demographic correlates of health insurance. A
recent report by the Institute of Medicine (2001) reviews this literature and also presents new
analyses confirming what earlier studies have shown: the probability of being uninsured is higher
for individuals who are poor, less well-educated, nonwhite, and/or in families without a worker.
In addition to studies that take a demographic approach to analyzing the determinants of
coverage, a number of recent studies also suggest that private coverage responds at the margin to
economic incentives. For example, Cooper and Schone (1997) and Farber and Levy (2000) both
document that the decline in employer-sponsored coverage during the late 1980s and early 1990s
was due to declines in enrollment among eligible employees. Cutler and Gruber (1996) show
that the Medicaid expansions during the same period caused a decline in private coverage. Rask
and Rask (2000) and Herring (2001) both show that private coverage rates respond to the
availability of charity care in a community.

All of these studies suggest that – as we might

expect in a voluntary system – having coverage or not is the result of a sequence of rational
economic decisions.
As we have already mentioned, in a simple economic model the amount of a good
purchased is determined by income, prices (of all goods), and preferences. Several papers
address either explicitly or implicitly the importance of income in determining whether or not a
household has insurance coverage.

In addition to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report

discussed above, Thomas (1994/95) estimates the marginal increase in the probability of having
insurance as income rises; she concludes that the income threshold above which families are
likely to purchase health insurance is 125% of poverty. Her estimates show that about half of
families just below this threshold purchase insurance. Bundorf and Pauly (2000) also estimate

5

the marginal impact of income on the probability of coverage, using more narrowly defined
income categories than does Thomas. Their results show the probability of coverage increasing
more or less continuously with family income. This is prima facie evidence that income is not
the sole determinant of coverage; if it were, we would expect a sharp discontinuity in the
probability of having health insurance at some threshold level of income. Yegian et al. (2000)
note that about 40 percent of the uninsured are above twice the poverty level and report results
from a survey of California’s nonpoor uninsured population. Interestingly, although 60 percent
of respondents agree with the statement “I worry a lot about not having health insurance for
others in my family,” only 41 percent agree that “health insurance ranks very high on my list of
priorities for where to spend my money.” Since these families are all above twice the poverty
level, the implication again is that being above poverty is insufficient to ensure the purchase of
health insurance.
A number of other studies explore how prices affect health insurance coverage. Before
considering the results of these studies, it is worth noting a few important distinctions. The first
is between the price of health insurance and the price of other goods. Without exception,
existing studies of the relationship between prices and health insurance coverage focus on the
price of health insurance. The second distinction, which applies to discussions of the price of
health insurance, is between prices that are actuarially unfair and prices that are actuarially fair
but high relative to income. With one exception which we discuss below, existing studies of
prices and health insurance discuss prices in the second sense. That is, they consider whether the
overall increase in the level of health insurance prices helps explain the overall decline in
coverage, rather than whether information asymmetries in the insurance market cause some
consumers to drop out of the market. The third and final set of distinctions concerns how to

6

measure the overall ‘price’ of health insurance. Is the correct measure of price the expected
benefit or the administrative load on that benefit? Is it the employee’s share of the premium or
the total premium? This issue is discussed at length by Chernew, Cutler and Keenan (2002); we
do not discuss this issue here except to note that it is a point of debate in this area of the
literature.
Several studies examine the relationship between the price of health insurance and
coverage. Most of these estimate the own-price elasticity of takeup of coverage offered by an
employer, rather than the relationship between health insurance prices and the overall rate of
insurance coverage. An exception is the study by Chernew, Cutler and Keenan (2002), who find
only a weak negative relationship between changes in the overall cost of health insurance and
rates of health insurance coverage at the MSA level. The estimates of takeup elasticities are
generally also quite low; Chernew, Frick and McLaughlin (1997) and Gruber and Washington
(2003) conclude that because of these low elasticities, premium subsidies to workers have only
limited potential to increase coverage rates. Cutler (2002) also finds a low elasticity of takeup but
points out that combined with large increases in employee premium contributions, this effect can
explain the entire decline in take-up of employer-sponsored insurance during the 1990s.
Only the paper by Cardon and Hendel (2001) addresses the question of whether prices in
the market for health insurance are actuarially unfair and therefore potentially responsible for the
fact that some people do not buy insurance. Cardon and Hendel conclude that there is no
evidence of adverse selection. Evidence on the role of price of health insurance – in either sense
– in determining insurance coverage is therefore mixed.
There are to our knowledge no studies that have looked at how the price of other goods
affects the probability of insurance coverage. As a review of why this is relevant, consider how

7

the demand for good Y2 is in theory affected by the price of another good Y1. The cross-price
version of the Slutsky equation summarizing this relationship, with income denoted by m, is:
∂Y2
∂Y
∂Y
= −Y1 ⋅ 2 + 2
∂p1
∂m ∂p1 U =U
This cross-price effect has two components. The first term – the income effect associated with
the change in the price of Y1 – reduces the consumption of Y2 as long as Y2 is a normal good (by
definition). The second term – the compensated substitution effect – may be either positive (the
goods are net substitutes) or negative (the goods are net complements).

Provided the

compensated substitution effect is negative or, if positive, is at least smaller in absolute value
than the income effect, demand for Y2 will decrease in response to an increase in the price of Y1.
That is, the goods may be gross substitutes even if they are not net substitutes. Put even more
simply, an increase in the price of one good may “squeeze out” some spending on another. We
are interested in exploring whether this phenomenon may help explain why some households do
not have insurance.
To summarize, our reading of the existing literature suggests three things: first, that
income alone cannot explain the fact that some households have health insurance and some do
not. Second, that the evidence on the role of the price of health insurance in explaining lack of
health insurance coverage is mixed. Third, although there has been no work attempting to
determine how the prices of other goods affect health insurance coverage, simple economic
theory predicts that they should matter. One of our goals in looking at the consumption patterns
of insured and uninsured households is to try to understand whether higher prices of other goods
may help explain why some households do not have health insurance.

8

3. Methods
Our main analysis relies on a comparison of the spending patterns of uninsured
households with insured households that are comparable in terms of demographics and total
spending.

Specifically, we estimate multivariate regressions controlling for household

composition and demographics. For each of the sixteen expenditure categories, we estimate a
separate linear regression with the household’s spending in that category as the dependent
variable:
Y j = Xβ j + γ ⋅ (uninsured ) + δ ⋅ (total spending ) + STATE + ( y1994 + ... + y1998 ) + ε j

(1)

where j indexes the 16 expenditure categories, X is a vector of demographic controls,
uninsured is a dummy variable equal to one if the household has no health insurance, STATE is a
vector of state dummy variables, and y1994…y1998 is a set of year dummies. The demographic
controls we use are race (white, non-white) of the head, educational attainment of the head
(indicator variables for being a high school dropout, being a high school graduate, having some
college, or being a college graduate), age of the head, the number of male adults in the family,
the number of female adults in the family, the number of boys (ages 2 to 17) in the family, the
number of girls (ages 2 to 17) in the family, and the number of infants. The coefficient γ on the
uninsured dummy measures the average difference in spending on good j for an uninsured
compared to an insured household. To focus on households that must choose between paying for
private insurance and being uninsured, we drop households where anyone has public insurance
from the sample. We also drop households in which some members have private insurance and
some are uninsured. We describe exactly how the sample is drawn in section four.
These regressions allow us to identify which goods take up more of an uninsured
household’s budget than an insured household’s. In order to see how this may help shed light on

9

whether prices or preferences explain why one household has health insurance and another with
the same total budget does not, we review the relationship between prices and spending.
Consider a consumer with income m who allocates this income to n goods X1,…,Xn and faces a
vector of prices p1,…pn. Expenditures on good j are given by X j p j . If the price of good 1
increases, the expenditure on good 1 may increase or decrease depending on the own-price
elasticity of demand for good 1:

∂ ( X1 p1 )
∂dX1
= X1 + p1 ⋅
= X1 ⋅ 1 + η x1 , p1 .
∂p1
∂p1

(

)

So if X1 is inelastically demanded (that is, η x1 , p1 < 1 ), the amount spent on X1 increases
with the price of X1. Suppose we observe uninsured households spending more than insured
households on good X1 (holding total spending and other household characteristics constant). If
we are to conclude that this spending differential occurs because the insured and the uninsured
face different prices, it must be that X1 is inelastically demanded with respect to its own price and
the uninsured face higher prices than the insured.3

4. Data

The data we analyze are from the 1994 through 1998 panels of the Consumer Expenditure
Survey (CEX). The CEX, which is collected by the Census Bureau under contract from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, is a nationally representative survey of about 7,000 households per
year. It contains information on the demographic characteristics of each household member and

3

Alternatively, this could happen if demand for X1 were elastic and the uninsured faced lower prices than the
insured. We do not focus on this possibility since the uninsured facing lower prices than the insured for other goods
ought to increase their health insurance spending (unless there are very strong patterns of net substitution between
health insurance and other goods).

10

detailed household-level information on income, expenditures and health insurance. In the CEX,
a “consumer unit” or family is the basic unit of observation. A consumer unit is smaller than a
“household” and is meant to include only those household members who depend upon one
another and who share expenditures. For details of the distinction between a consumer unit and
a household in the CEX, please see BLS (2002).4 In this paper, we use the terms family and
household interchangeably. Each household is interviewed up to four times at three-month
intervals. Three months of expenditure data are collected retrospectively at each quarterly
interview for a total of twelve months of expenditure data.

Preliminary sample restrictions
We begin with 39,617 households interviewed in the 1994 through 1998 panels of the CEX.
For each household, we have between one and four observations on quarterly expenditures in
each of these categories. We average quarterly expenditures over however many observations are
available so that there is one observation per household for each expenditure category. Medical
care and housing expenditures in a given quarter may be negative (because of reimbursements or
refunds).

We drop from the sample 345 households that have negative average quarterly

expenditures in one or both of these categories, 471 households with missing income data and 47
households without adults, resulting in a sample of 38,754 households.

4

According to the BLS, a consumer unit consists of any of the following: (1) All members of a particular household
who are related by blood, marriage, adoption, or other legal arrangements; (2) a person living alone or sharing a
household with others or living as a roomer in a private home or lodging house or in permanent living quarters in a
hotel or motel, but who is financially independent; or (3) two or more persons living together who use their incomes
to make joint expenditure decisions. Financial independence is determined by the three major expense categories:
Housing, food, and other living expenses. To be considered financially independent, at least two of the three major
expenditure categories have to be provided entirely or in part by the respondent. In regard to the CEX, the BLS uses
the terms consumer unit, family, and household interchangeably for convenience. However, the proper technical
term in the CEX is consumer unit (BLS 2002).

11

Defining the uninsured
Each household in the CEX reports the total number of health insurance policies held by
anyone in the household in each quarter, and the number of household members covered by each
policy. It is not possible to identify which individuals in a household are covered (either as
dependents or as the policyholder) by a particular private policy. Each household also reports
which individuals were covered by Medicare and/or Medicaid. We categorize households as
uninsured, partially insured, fully insured, covered by Medicaid or covered by Medicare
according to the insurance status of all members of the household at the first quarter in which the
household is observed, as follows:
•

Households that do not report holding any private insurance policies and have zero
expenditure on health insurance are considered to be uninsured.

•

Households that report holding a private insurance policy or policies that cover some
but not all household members and report zero expenditure on health insurance are
considered partially insured.

•

Households that report holding one or more private insurance policies that cover at
least as many people as there are in the household or who report any positive
expenditures on health insurance are considered fully insured.

•

Households with at least one member covered by Medicaid and no one covered by
Medicare are considered covered by Medicaid (even if some or all members of the
household also have private insurance).

12

•

Households with anyone covered by Medicare, or in which the reference person is
age 65 or older, are considered covered by Medicare (even if some or all members of
the household also have private insurance).

Households may change insurance status across waves. We discard the 2,623 households that
do so, leaving us with a sample of 36,131 households; our results are very similar if instead we
categorize household on the basis of their insurance status at the first interview.

Expenditure categories
The CEX gathers data on expenditures in hundreds of detailed categories. We aggregate
these detailed expenditures into 16 broad expenditure categories: (1) food to be consumed in the
home, (2) food to be consumed outside of the home (at restaurants etc.), (3) alcohol and tobacco,
(4) housing expenses (rent and renting-related expenses, mortgage and mortgage related
expenses, and home improvements), (5) non-mortgage interest, (6) furniture, appliances and
related expenses, (7) home maintenance, (8) clothing (adult clothing and shoes, children’s
clothing and shoes, and clothing services), (9) transportation (car purchases, car leases, other
private transportation expenses, fuel, car repairs, car insurance, public transportation expenses),
(10) utilities, (11) medical care, (12) health insurance, (13) entertainment expenses, (14) personal
care, (15) education, and (16) other. Note that each of these categories includes expenditures
made by the household members only – in particular, expenses made on behalf of households
members by insurance companies or employers are not reflected in these data. This means that
medical care and health insurance reflect out-of-pocket payments only.
The CEX measures expenditures and not consumption. Expenditures may be a noisy
measure of consumption – for example, where a family occupies public housing. In addition,

13

there is topcoding for some expenditure items.

In order to minimize measurement error

associated with these factors, we trim the top and bottom 5 percent of spenders in our sample.
This does not appreciably change the substance of our results and leaves a sample of 32,519
households. Of these, about one-third are either partially insured or publicly insured: 2 percent
partially insured, 7 percent Medicaid, 25 percent Medicare. We drop these households from the
analysis.5 Our analysis focuses on the remaining 4,682 uninsured households and 16,842 fully
privately insured households, to whom we refer from now on as “the uninsured” and “the
insured,” respectively.

Measurement error in health insurance and medical care spending
Since the CEX collects data on out-of-pocket spending only, both health insurance and
medical care spending are certain to be mismeasured for the insured because of employer-paid
health insurance premiums and direct payments from insurers to medical providers. This has
two implications for our analysis.

First, the observed spending differentials in these two

categories between the insured and the uninsured will understate the true difference in spending.
As long as we are primarily interested in other categories of spending (e.g., food and housing),
this just means that we should keep in mind that the estimated differentials for health insurance
and medical care are likely to be understated. Second, and more seriously, our measure of total
spending will be systematically underestimated for the insured but not for the uninsured. This
has the potential to bias our estimates of the insured/uninsured differential on other categories of
spending, like food and housing. This is because we are effectively comparing a richer insured

5

The regression results do not change much if the partially insured are included with the fully insured. They are
also robust to categorizing households on the basis of reported policies only (i.e. households with a policy that
covers only some household members and positive health insurance spending are counted as partially insured).

14

household with a poorer uninsured household, even though both have the same observed total
spending.
To bound the magnitude of this bias, we calculate an alternative set of estimates as follows.
Since workers directly pay, on average, only about 20 percent of health insurance premiums with
firms paying the remainder on their behalf (Krueger and Levy 1996), we assume that total health
insurance spending would actually be five times what we observe for each household in the
CEX. We re-estimate all the regressions using this alternative measure of health insurance
spending and the higher level of total spending it implies. This adjustment does not substantially
affect any of the results of the analysis presented below, so we conclude that the understatement
of health insurance and total spending for the insured is unlikely to be a significant source of
bias.

5. Results

We begin our empirical analysis by stratifying the sample by total spending and
calculating the fraction with private health insurance at each spending level. These results are
presented in table 1.6 Consistent with the results of earlier work discussed above, we find that
the fraction with health insurance increases fairly smoothly with income. Moreover, even at the
ends of the distribution, the fraction with insurance is not close to zero or one. Among the
poorest two percent of households in our sample, 30 percent have private health insurance, and
seven percent of households in the top fifth of the expenditure distribution are uninsured. The
point here is that there does not appear to be a level of income that functions as a cutoff above

All of the statistics and analyses we present have been weighted using the sampling weights provided with the
CEX so as to be nationally representative.

15

which everyone has private insurance and below which no one does, so income alone cannot
explain why some households are uninsured.
Table 2 presents statistics on demographic and household composition by insurance
status. Comparing mean values of the household demographic characteristics for the different
groups reveals that uninsured households have lower total expenditures than fully insured
households: uninsured households have mean quarterly expenditures of only $5,077, compared
with $8,050 for fully insured households. Household heads in uninsured households have lower
educational attainment than the heads of insured households; 22 percent of uninsured household
heads are high school dropouts, compared with only 8 percent in fully insured households. They
are also more likely to be nonwhite (19.8 percent for uninsured versus 13.0 percent for fully
insured).
Differences in employment and homeownership are more pronounced.

Uninsured

households are more than twice as likely as fully insured households to have no earner (8.4
percent versus 3.0 percent). Note, however, that this still means that the vast majority of the
uninsured are in households with at least one worker. Conditional on having an earner, heads in
uninsured households are less likely to work in the public sector (8.8 percent versus 13.7
percent) and more likely to be self-employed (8.6 percent versus 4.2 percent) than are heads in
fully insured households. The most striking difference, however, may be that the uninsured are
nearly twice as likely to be renters: 61.8 percent of the uninsured rent their homes, compared
with only 33.4 percent of the fully insured. To the extent that these household characteristics
drive spending patterns, it will be important to control for them in our analysis in order to
understand the differences between the spending of the insured and the uninsured.

16

Table 3 shows mean budget shares and mean real expenditures (in 1998 dollars) for all
households by insurance status. The three largest expenditure categories for both insured and
uninsured households are housing, food at home, and transportation. Insured households spend
just over three percent of their budgets, or $236 per quarter, on health insurance (recall that this
amount does not reflect payments made directly by an employer to an insurance company on the
household’s behalf).
Comparing budget shares across insurance status reveals that the uninsured spend a larger
share of their budgets on food at home (16.9 percent) than the fully insured (12.8 percent). The
uninsured also spend a larger share on housing: 26.6 percent versus 25.4 percent for the fully
insured. The uninsured spend a substantially smaller share of their budgets on transportation
(15.7 percent versus 17.2 percent for the fully insured). Out-of-pocket medical care expenses
account for a slightly larger share of budgets for the insured (3.8 percent versus 1.9 percent for
the uninsured).7
As we have already noted, insured and uninsured households do not differ only in their
health insurance status. As a first cut at comparing uninsured households with similar insured
households, we calculate mean expenditure shares separately for insured and uninsured
households in the lowest quartile (“low spenders”), the middle 50 percent (“middle spenders”),
and the top quartile of total expenditures (“high spenders”). The results are presented in table 4.
Among low spenders, the uninsured spend a larger fraction of their budgets on housing than do
the insured (28.2 percent compared with 26.1 percent), on food at home (19.5 percent compared
with 16.5 percent), and on education (3.5 percent compared with 2.4 percent). Low-spending
uninsured households also spend a larger share of their budgets on alcohol and tobacco (4.4

Paulin and Weber (1995) report similar differences in spending patterns between insured and uninsured and
uninsured households in the 1993 Consumer Expenditure Survey.

17

percent compared to 3.3 percent) than do insured households. On average, the low-spending
uninsured spend $126 per quarter on alcohol and tobacco, which is more than the $119 that their
insured counterparts spend out-of-pocket on health insurance.

This is not to suggest that

uninsured households could actually purchase health insurance with the amount they currently
spend on alcohol and tobacco – as we have already noted, most health insurance premiums are
paid by employers, so that the actual price of health insurance per quarter is more likely to be
about $595 per quarter for these households.
At the same time, low-spending uninsured households spend a smaller share of their
budgets on categories other than health insurance.

The low-spending uninsured spend

significantly less on interest, home maintenance, transportation, utilities, health care and personal
care than do insured households with similar total expenditures.
The differences between spending patterns of the insured versus the uninsured are much
smaller for high spenders. In particular, the only categories on which uninsured high-spenders
spend a significantly larger share of their budgets than do insured high-spenders are alcohol and
tobacco (0.017 versus 0.014), transportation (0.320 versus 0.239), furniture and appliances
(0.063 versus 0.054) and education (0.035 versus 0.030). This is a striking contrast to the result
reported above for low-spending households; the differences between insured and uninsured
households’ consumption patterns are very different for poorer versus well-off households.

Regression Results
Of course, the insured and the uninsured differ in many ways other than total spending;
for example, as shown in table 2, the uninsured have lower educational attainment and are more
likely to be non-white. In order to control for total spending as well as these observable

18

differences, we run multivariate regressions to estimate adjusted differences in spending using
the methods described above. Table 5 presents the coefficients on the “uninsured” dummy
variable from separate regressions (for each of the sixteen expenditure categories) corresponding
to equation (1) for all households.8

The coefficient on this “uninsured” dummy variable

measures the average difference in spending between insured and uninsured households for that
expenditure category.
It is not obvious whether controls for employment, urban location and homeownership
ought to be included in these regressions, since all three of these characteristics could be
considered household consumption choices. One person might choose to own a home in Ithaca,
NY, for example, while another person with the same total budget might choose to rent an
apartment in Manhattan.9 Since it is not clear whether including these controls is appropriate, we
present results corresponding to three different specifications. The first specification includes
only basic controls—age, sex, race and education of the household head, and the number of adult
males, adult females, girls, boys and infants in the household and year and state dummies. The
second specification adds to these basic controls dummy variables reflecting whether a
household has zero, one, or two or more earners; the sector of employment of the primary earner
(private, public, self-employed, or unknown/no primary earner); and a set of dummies reflecting
whether the household lives in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and whether the household
lives in an urban area. The third specification includes, in addition to the basic, employment, and
urbanicity controls, controls for homeownership.

The homeownership controls consist of

dummies for whether the household owns a home without a mortgage, owns a home with a

The complete set of results (that is, the coefficients on the independent variables in addition to the “uninsured”
dummy) corresponding to the basic regression in column one of table 5 is reported in Table A1 of the appendix.

19

mortgage, rents, occupies a home rent-free, or lives in dormitory. Columns (1), (2), and (3) of
table five report the linear regression results for the specifications including basic, employment
and urbanicity, and homeownership controls respectively.
Since the results in table 4 suggested that the difference between insured and uninsured
households may look different depending on how well-off the households are, we also stratify
the sample by total spending and estimate complete sets of regressions on each subsample.
Tables 6, 7 and 8 present results of these regressions for households in the lowest quartile (“low
spenders”), middle fifty percent (“middle spenders”), and top quartile (“high spenders”) of the
total spending distribution respectively.
Since more than half of the uninsured households in our sample (2,403 out of 4,682) are
low spenders, we begin by focusing on our results for this group, presented in table six. These
results confirm that for the low-spending households, the mean differences between uninsured
and insured households that were reported in table four persist when we control for a basic set of
household characteristics. In particular, according to the linear regression results, the uninsured
spend significantly more than do insured households on housing ($88), on food at home ($40),
on education ($35) and on alcohol and tobacco ($20). These results confirm that low-spending
uninsured households spend more on basic needs, plus alcohol and tobacco. The uninsured also
spend significantly less than the insured on several items besides health insurance: interest ($24
less), utilities ($22 less), home maintenance ($10 less), and personal care ($4 less). Figure two
summarizes these differentials graphically.
What do these spending differentials suggest about whether the low-spending uninsured
may face higher prices than the insured for goods other than health insurance? Consider the
9

One might argue that education and family composition are consumption choices as well. In practice, controlling
for these variables (the basic regression specification) yields the same qualitative result as the simple differences in

20

largest differential, the $88 more per quarter the uninsured spend on housing. Since housing is
inelastically demanded with respect to its own price (Hanushek and Quigley [1980]), the higher
housing expenditures of the uninsured are consistent with their facing higher prices for housing.
Alternative explanations for this differential include that the uninsured consume more or better
housing. We present evidence below that the uninsured do not consume more housing. Further
support for the idea that the uninsured may, in fact, face higher housing prices comes when we
add controls for housing tenure to the regression. The addition of employment and urbanicity
controls does not change the regression-adjusted estimates of the differences in spending
between insured and uninsured households; adding the homeownership controls, in contrast,
eliminates more than half of the difference in housing and home maintenance expenditures and
all of the difference in expenditures on utilities between insured and uninsured households. Thus,
the results for the low-spending uninsured (representing more than half the total uninsured in our
sample) raise the interesting possibility that high housing prices may partially explain the fact
that these households do not have health insurance.
The differential between insured and uninsured middle-spending households look
somewhat different from those just discussed for the low-spending households. Among middle
spenders, uninsured households spend significantly more than insured households on
transportation ($172), education ($101), food at home ($31), and alcohol and tobacco ($25).
Adding controls for employment, urbanicity and housing tenure reduces some of these
differentials a bit (in particular, the education differential drops to $68 and the alcohol/tobacco
differentials drops to $14), but all remain significant. What is most interesting about these results
is that in contrast to the low-spending uninsured, who spent more than their insured counterparts
on a good that is demanded inelastically, the middle-spending uninsured spend more on goods
mean budget shares in Table 5.

21

that are likely to be demanded elastically: education and transportation. This means that higher
prices of goods other than health insurance are not a plausible explanation for lack of insurance
coverage in this group.
The regression results for high spenders illustrate this point even more clearly. The only
two categories on which high-spending uninsured spend more than their comparable insured
households are transportation ($673) and furniture/appliances ($102). As long as these goods are
demanded elastically with respect to price, higher spending suggests that if the uninsured face
different prices from the insured these prices must be lower and therefore cannot explain why the
uninsured do not have health insurance. In common sense terms, it simply does not sound
plausible to suggest that the well-off uninsured do not buy health insurance because of the high
cost of transportation and furniture.
Thus, analysis of spending patterns of the well-off uninsured does not offer plausible
candidates for goods other than health insurance that might help explain why these households
do not buy health insurance. Two possibilities remain. One is that the well-off uninsured face
higher prices of health insurance than the well-off insured. We have no way to test this
possibility with these data. Alternatively, we might conclude that the well-off uninsured simply
have different preferences than the well-off insured. If this latter explanation is correct, as we
have already noted, it is not obvious what role there is for policy intervention.

Detailed Analyses of the Housing Expenses of Low-Spending households
The CEX data allow us to analyze the differences in housing spending for low-spending
insured and uninsured households in more detail. We have already demonstrated that the
inclusion of controls for housing tenure “explains” about half of the spending differential in the

22

sense that it drops from $88 to $38 in magnitude. We can also use more disaggregated data to see
exactly which components of housing expenditure are higher for the uninsured and to see
whether the uninsured consume more housing than the insured. Table 9 presents descriptive
statistics on components of housing expenditure and housing characteristics for low-spending
insured and uninsured households. The first two row of table 9 shows that uninsured households
spend a larger share of their budgets and a larger real dollar expenditure on housing than do
insured households—this is the same information reported in table 4. An examination of the
components of housing expenditure shows that this difference in total expenditure is being
driven primarily by differences in rent, which is the largest single component of housing
expenditure. Table 9 also shows that on average, the uninsured do not consume a larger quantity
of housing when quantity is defined as number of rooms: the uninsured living in housing units
with 4.3 rooms on average compared with 4.7 for the insured.
To control for differences in homeownership status (though not other observable
differences between the insured and the uninsured), table 10 presents the same statistics on
detailed housing expenditures by insurance status separately for homeowners without a
mortgage, homeowners with a mortgage, and renters. Among homeowners with no mortgage,
there are no differences between the housing expenditures of insured and uninsured. Similarly,
among renters, uninsured households do not have higher expenditures. In fact, uninsured renters
spend $104 less per quarter than do insured renters. There are differences in expenditure
between insured and uninsured households among homeowners with a mortgage. Thus, the
overall differences in housing expenditure between insured and uninsured households are
primarily due to differences in homeownership status, plus slightly higher expenditure among
uninsured homeowners with mortgages.

23

Table 11 reports the coefficient on the “uninsured” dummy variable from a set of linear
regressions with the components of housing expenditure as the dependent variables. As in tables
5 through 8, the three columns correspond to specifications with basic controls (first column),
plus controls for employment and urbanicity (second column) and plus controls for
homeownership (third column). As we expect given the findings reported in table 10, the
addition of homeownership controls eliminates almost all of the differences between insured and
uninsured households not only for total housing expenditure but also for each of the components
of housing expenditure.

Detailed Analysis of the Transportation Expenses of High-Spending Households
The fact that high-spending uninsured households spend a larger share of their budgets on
transportation than do high-spending insured households raises two questions: first, what
particular transportation expense is driving these differences? Second, is this result driven by the
fact that some households are incorrectly classified as “high spenders” by a one-time purchase of
a durable good like a car? To address the first question, table 12 reports the breakdown of
average transportation expenditures for insured and uninsured households into detailed
components. It appears that the differences between the insured and uninsured are primarily in
spending on used cars. Table 12 also shows that the uninsured do not have a larger stock of
vehicles than the insured; the uninsured have on average 2.2 vehicles compared with 2.7 for the
insured. Table 13 reports regression-adjusted estimates of these differentials that support the
same conclusion: the difference between transportation spending of insured and uninsured
households is due to used cars. The inclusion of additional controls for employment, urbanicity
and housing tenure has almost no effect on the estimated difference.

24

Table 13 also presents regression results that use household income rather than total
expenditures as a control in the regressions to address the possibility that houses are being
misclassified as high spenders by a transitory spike in spending due to the purchase of a car. The
last three columns of table 13 contain these results. It appears that the use of expenditures rather
than income does explain some (not quite half) of the difference in spending between the insured
and uninsured. Using income as a control, the regression-adjusted estimate of the differential is
between $289 (including all controls) and $430 (basic controls only), compared with $457 (all
controls) to $673 (basic controls) when including total expenditures instead of income. The
differentials remain significant, however.

6.

Discussion

We have documented that there are differences in the spending patterns of insured and
uninsured households, and also that the spending differentials are quite different for lowspending versus high spending households. For low-spending households, expenditures of the
uninsured relative to the uninsured are tilted primarily toward housing and food; for high
spenders, the differential is transportation and furniture/appliances. At what level of spending
does this crossover occur?

To answer this question, we aggregate expenditures into two

categories: basic needs and non-basic needs. We consider food at home, housing, and utilities to
be basic needs; all other expenditures are non-basic. The first row of table 14 reports the fraction
of our sample that is insured, and share of total spending allocated to basic needs for both the
insured and uninsured. The uninsured spend, on average, 54 percent of their budget on basic
needs compared with 48 percent for the insured. Of course, the main reason for this is that
uninsured households are poorer than insured households, on average, and basic needs are

25

necessities. This can be seen in the first two columns of Table 14 which report the cumulative
fractions of the entire sample and the uninsured sample by expenditure level: the median
household has quarterly total expenditures between $6,500 and $7,000 while the median
uninsured household has quarterly total expenditures between $4,000 and $4,500.
The fourth and fifth columns of Table 14 report the share of households’ budgets that are
spent on basic needs at a variety of total expenditure levels. For example, uninsured households
with quarterly total expenditures of less than $2,000 spend 60.4 percent of their budgets on basic
needs compared with 50.4 percent for comparable insured households.

At what level of

quarterly total expenditure do uninsured households begin to spend less on basic needs than
comparable insured households?

At a quarterly total expenditure of about $6,500, both

uninsured and insured households spend about 50 percent of their budgets on basic needs. At all
levels of total expenditure below $6,500 per quarter, uninsured households spend more on basic
needs than do insured households.

Moreover, 76.8 percent of uninsured households have

quarterly total expenditure levels of $6,500 or less. Therefore, one could consider about threequarters of the uninsured as falling below a spending level where insurance is in a very loose
sense being “replaced” by spending on basic needs.
A regression-based approach to the same question is the following. We estimate the
share of spending devoted to basic needs as a function of total expenditures, a dummy for
uninsurance and total expenditures interacted with a dummy for uninsurance, controlling for
demographics and household composition. This regression captures the relationship between
spending on basic needs and total expenditures for insured and uninsured households; figure 5
depicts this relationship graphically. The idea is that at low levels of total expenditure, uninsured
households spend more on basic needs than do insured households, while at higher levels of total

26

expenditure, uninsured households do not spend more on basic needs than do insured
households. We want to know at what implied level of total spending an uninsured household
spends less on basic needs than do insured households. In figure 5, this level of total expenditure
is given by Y*, where the two lines intersect.
The results of this regression are presented in table 15. The coefficient on the uninsured
dummy is 0.08365; the coefficient on total expenditures is –0.000019 and the coefficient on the
interaction of uninsured with total expenditures is –0.000011. This means that at low levels of
expenditure, the uninsured spend a higher fraction of their budgets on basic needs, but that this
differential gets smaller as total expenditure increases. At a total expenditure of $7,594 per
quarter, the uninsured begin spending a smaller share of their budgets on basic needs than do the
insured at the same level of total expenditure. That is, the value of Y* in figure 5 implied by this
regression is $7,594. Eighty-four percent of uninsured households fall below this threshold. Of
course, 53 percent of households with insurance also fall below this threshold.
Our definition of “basic needs” is arbitrary. An alternative way to do this is to use the
economic definition of necessities versus luxuries. We estimate total expenditure elasticities for
each category of consumption and determine that the following expenditures are empirically
necessities (i.e. they have total expenditure elasticity of less than or equal to one; results are in
appendix Table A2): food at home, utilities, health insurance, alcohol and tobacco, personal care,
housing, interest, food away from home, and clothing.

Using this definition to aggregate

expenditures into necessities (except for health insurance) and luxuries, we find very similar
results to those using the “basic needs” dependent variable. These results also are reported in
table 15. We estimate that at total expenditures of $7,032, uninsured households begin spending

27

less on necessities than do insured households. Eighty percent of uninsured households and 47
percent of insured households fall below this threshold.

7. Conclusion

Our main results and their implications for future research on the uninsured can be
summarized as follows. First, we find that income cannot be the whole story for why some
households do not have health insurance: the probability of coverage increases more or less
continuously with income. This result has appeared in the literature but it is worth emphasizing
that this means low income cannot be the only explanation for lack of coverage. Second, we find
that low-income uninsured households – comprising most of the uninsured – spend more than
comparable insured households on some necessities and, in particular, on housing. This raises the
intriguing possibility, which we plan to explore in future work, that high housing prices may help
explain why some households do not have health insurance. Third, high-income uninsured
households have higher spending only on transportation and furniture/appliances. This suggests
it is highly unlikely that price differentials for goods other than health insurance (such as
housing, food, utilities, or transportation) explain why they are uninsured.

Instead, either

preferences or high prices of health insurance must explain the lack of insurance coverage for a
small but nontrivial fraction of well-off households.
What are the implications for policy? Firm recommendations for policy await more
conclusive results on the role of health insurance prices versus housing prices in explaining lack
of insurance coverage among the low-spending insured. But we believe that our preliminary
results should add two new dimensions to policy discussions about the uninsured. First,
heterogeneity within the population without health insurance highlights the dangers of treating

28

“the uninsured” as a single group. Our results for low-spending uninsured households are quite
different from those for high-spending uninsured households.

High-spending uninsured

households are a minority of the uninsured (about ten percent) but represent a nontrivial number
of households: about four million. It may make more sense in thinking about public policy to
focus on the needs of the poor uninsured than simply the uninsured. Second, when we think
about why households are uninsured, the discussion should be extended beyond income and the
price of health insurance to include a role for the prices of other goods. Our results strongly
suggest a role for housing prices in explaining why some uninsured households lack coverage.
Modeling health insurance coverage as economic choice that requires weighing all possible uses
for income will help us better understand the choices households do – or don’t – make

Notes:
1. Sample size for both regressions is 21,524.
2. “Basic needs” are defined as food at home, housing and utilities.
3. Necessities are defined as food at home, food away from home, housing, utilities, alcohol
and tobacco, interest, personal care and health care (i.e. all goods with elasticities with
respect to total spending less than or equal to one, except for health insurance).
