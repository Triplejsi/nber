ABSTRACT
The Burnside and Dollar (2000, AER) finding that aid raises growth in a good policy environment
has had an important influence on policy and academic debates. We conduct a data gathering
exercise that updates their data from 1970 -93 to 1970 -97, as well as filling in missing data for the
original period 1970 -93. We find that the Burnside and Dollar (2002, AER) finding is not robust
to the use of this additional data.

I. Introduction
In an extraordinarily influential paper, Burnside and Dollar (2000, p. 847) find that “…
aid has a positive impact on growth in developing countries with good fiscal, monetary, and
trade policies but has little effect in the presence of poor policies.” This finding has enormous
policy implications. The Burnside and Dollar (2000, henceforth BD) result provides a role and
strategy for foreign aid. If aid stimulates growth only in countries with good policies, this
suggests that (1) aid can promote economic growth and (2) it is crucial that foreign aid be
distributed selectively to countries that have adopted sound policies. International aid agencies,
public policymakers, and the press quickly recognized the importance of the BD findings.1

This paper reassesses the links between aid, policy, and growth using more data. The BD
data end in 1993. We reconstruct the BD database from original sources and thus (1) add
additional countries and observations to the BD dataset because new information has become
available since they conducted their analyses and (2) extend the data through 1997. Thus, using
the BD methodology, we reexamine whether aid influences growth in the presence of good
policies.

Given our focus on retesting BD, we do not summarize the vast pre-BD literature on aid
and growth. We just note that there was a long and inconclusive literature that was hampered by
limited data availability, debates about the mechanisms through which aid would affect growth,
and disagreements over econometric specification (See, Papanek, 1972; Cassen, 1986; Mosley et
al., 2001; Boone, 1994, 1996; and Hansen and Tarp’s 2000 review).

Millennium Challenge Corporation (White House 2002), as well as the Economist (March 16, 2002), a Washington
Post editorial (February 9, 2002), and a Financial Times column by Alan Beattie (March 11, 2002).

Since BD found that aid boosts growth in good policy environments, there have been a
number of other papers reacting to their results, including Collier and Dehn (2001), Collier and
Dollar (2001), Dalgaard and Hansen (2001), Guillaumont and Chauvet (2001), Hansen and Tarp
(2001), and Lensink and White (2001). These papers conduct useful variations and extensions
(some of which had already figured in the pre-BD literature), such as introducing additional
control variables, using non-linear specifications, etc. Some of these papers confirm the message
that aid only works in a good policy environment, while others drive out the aid*policy
interaction term with other variables. This literature has the usual limitations of how to choose
the appropriate specification without clear guidance from theory, which often means there are
more plausible specifications than there are data points in the sample.
We differentiate our paper from these others by NOT deviating from the BD
specification. Thus, we do not test the robustness of the results to an unlimited number of
variations, but instead maintain the BD methodology. This paper conducts a very simple
robustness check by adding new data that were unavailable to BD. Thus, we expand the sample
used over their time period and extend the data from 1993 to 1997.
II. Robustness checks on the aid-policy-growth relationship
BD’s preferred specification is a growth regression with several control variables
common to the literature, plus terms for the amount of international aid provided to a country
(Aid), an index of the quality of the policy environment (Policy), and an aid-policy interaction
term (Aid*Policy). As control variables, BD include the logarithm of initial Gross Domestic
Product per capita (Log initial GDP), a measure of ethnic fractionalization (Ethnic), the rate of
political assassinations (Assassinations), the interaction between ethnic fractionalization and
political assassinations (Ethnic*Assassinations), regional dummy variables for Sub-Saharan
Africa and fast-growing East Asian countries (Sub-Saharan Africa and Fast-growing E. Asia
respectively), an index of institutional quality (Institutional Quality), and a measure of financial
depth (M2/GDP lagged). The BD policy index, Policy, is constructed from measures of budget
balance, inflation, and the Sachs-Warner openness index. This specification corresponds to
2

regression 5 (all developing countries) and 8 (low income countries only) in the BD paper. In
Table 1, we first show regression 5 from BD using ordinary least squares (OLS). The sample
here is middle-income and low-income developing countries, and five outliers are omitted. These
are the five outliers omitted by BD. We reproduce exactly their results in column (1).
Since BD exclude observations that they consider outliers and since we want to follow
the BD methodology as closely as possible, we adopt the Hadi method for identifying and
eliminating outliers as we add new data. The Hadi method measures the distance of data points
from the main body of data and then iteratively reduces the sample to exclude distant data points.
Critically, when we apply the Hadi method to the BD data, we confirm their results. We will
continue to use the Hadi procedure in all the regressions in this paper except where we explicitly
note otherwise. In the spirit of the original BD methodology, we choose a Hadi significance level
of 0.05 that excludes only a handful of outliers (between 5 and 11). (See Table 2.) Note,
however, that keeping the outliers in the regressions does not change this paper’s conclusion.
To test the robustness of the BD results, we undertook an extensive data gathering
exercise. We collected annual data on all the variables in the BD sample. We went back to the
original sources and reconstructed the entire database and extended the data through 1997. As
part of this exercise, we updated the Sachs and Warner openness index. To construct the policy
index, we follow the BD regression procedure and we always include the budget balance,
inflation, and Sachs-Warner openness as components of Policy. In addition to extending the
sample through to 1997, we were able to expand the original BD data. For example, we found
broader coverage on International Country Risk Guide institutional quality for 1982 by using the
original source of the data. Considering both the cross-section and the time series expansion, we
have increased the sample size from their original 275 observations in 56 countries to 356
observations in 62 countries (before excluding outliers). An appendix describing the
methodology is presented below. The data are available at www.cgdev.org. Although our data
did not match up exactly with theirs (there are inevitably data revisions, where values change,
new data become available, and some values are reclassified as missing), the correlations are all
above 0.95 within their sample, except for budget balance, which is 0.92., and institutional
3

quality, which is 0.90. Moreover, we were able to reproduce their results with our data when
we restrict the sample to their time period and their countries as discussed below.
The BD results do not hold when we use new data that includes additional countries and
extends the coverage through 1997. The aid*policy interaction term enters insignificantly when
using data from 1970–1997 (Column 2). Not only that, but the coefficient on the aid*policy term
changes markedly, turning negative, with a t-statistic of –1.09. Figure 1 shows both the partial
scatter plot of the original BD sample between growth and aid*policy and the partial scatter plot
using our new, expanded data. As shown, the positive relationship between growth and
aid*policy vanishes when using new data. In these analyses, we continue to use the Hadi method
for eliminating outliers since this method reproduced the original BD results. However, when we
do not use Hadi and run the results on the full sample, we again find that the aid*policy variable
enters insignificantly (we will show these results below).
We perform the same exercise with BD regression 8 for the sample of low income
countries (also following them in omitting outliers). BD note that low income countries might be
a preferred sample to detect the effects of aid, and indeed their aid-policy interaction term is
significant in both OLS and two-stage least squares (2SLS) in their regression 8. In order to
check the robustness of the estimates of the instrumental variables estimates, we do the exercise
in two-stage least squares as shown in columns (3) and (4) of Table 1. We use the same set of
instruments as BD. We are again able to reproduce their results with our dataset (see Table 2
below).
The aid*policy term is insignificant in their regression 8 when we simply add all the data
for low-income countries that we can collect for 1970–93 and the data for 1994–97 (column 4).
The coefficient not only becomes insignificant, but changes sign. Our sample is 52 observations
larger than the BD sample for regression 8.
The fragile results on aid effectiveness remain evident when varying the sample. For
brevity, table 2 shows only the aid*policy coefficients, t-statistics, and number of observations
4

for OLS and 2SLS for regressions 5 and 8 for various combinations of sample periods, country
samples, and when including and excluding outliers. We reproduce statistical significance when
restricting our data to the Burnside-Dollar sample period and sample of countries, though the
coefficient sizes are larger when using the new data. The significance of the relationship
between growth and the aid*policy interaction term vanishes, however, if we relax either the
sample period constraint or the country selection constraint for either regression 5 or 8 (i.e. the
whole sample and only the low income sample). The significance vanishes for both OLS and
2SLS in either regression, for using their countries but the whole period sample or for their
sample period but all countries, and for samples excluding outliers and for samples including
outliers. Not only does significance vanish, but the magnitude of the coefficient changes greatly
across the different permutations.
The only significant coefficient out of our various permutations was for OLS for
regression 8 (the low income sample) using the Burnside-Dollar countries for the full sample
period. Since this is one significant coefficient at the 5 percent level out of twenty permutations,
we do not think this provides strong support for the robustness of the Burnside-Dollar results.
We tried all of these same exercises for the other aid*policy regressions that BD report in
the paper. Burnside and Dollar found the aid*policy term to be significant and positive when
they did NOT exclude outliers but added another term aid2*policy (which was significant and
negative). Their results were significant in OLS for the whole sample and the low income
sample, but not in 2SLS, so we report only the OLS results. We are able to reproduce their
results with our dataset using their sample period and sample of countries (Table 3). When we
try these specifications with our expanded dataset, the previous pattern holds: the aid-policy
interaction term is not robust to the use of new data, including various permutations of period
and country selection. In our full sample and in some of the other permutations, the coefficients
on the aid*policy and aid2*policy reverse sign from the BD results
Thus, the result of our paper is as follows: adding new data creates new doubts about the
BD conclusion. When we extend the sample forward to 1997, we no longer find that aid
5

promotes growth in good policy environments. Similarly, when we expand the BD data by
using the full set of data available over the original BD period, we no longer find that aid
promotes growth in good policy environments. Our findings regarding the fragility of the aidpolicy-growth nexus is unaffected by excluding or including outliers.
We also experimented with alternative definitions of “aid” and “good policies”, as well as
trying different period lengths (from annual data all the way up to the cross-section for the full
sample). These exercises (available upon request) did not change our conclusion about the
fragility of the aid*policy term – the aid-policy term is not robust to alternative equally plausible
definitions of aid and policy, or to alternative period lengths.

III. Conclusions
This paper reduces the confidence that one can have in the conclusion that aid promotes
growth in countries with sound policies. The paper does not argue that aid is ineffective. We
make a much more limited claim. We simply note that adding additional data to the BD study of
aid effectiveness raises new doubts about the effectiveness of aid and suggests that economists
and policymakers should be less sanguine about concluding that foreign aid will boost growth in
countries with good policies. We believe that BD should be a seminal paper that stimulates
additional work on aid effectiveness, but not yet the final answer on this critical issue. We hope
that further research will continue to explore pressing macroeconomic and microeconomic
questions surrounding foreign aid, such as whether aid can foment reforms in policies and
institutions that in turn foster economic growth, whether some foreign aid delivery mechanisms
work better than others, and what is the political economy of aid in both the donor and the
recipient.

Note: These partial scatter plots are from regressions 1 and 3 in Table 1. The partial scatter plot
involves the two-dimensional representation of the relationship between growth and aid*policy controlling
for the other regressors. Thus, we regress growth against the all of the regressors listed in Table 1 except
aid*policy and collect these growth residuals. Then, we regress aid*policy against the same regressors and
collect these aid*policy residuals. The figures plot the growth residuals against the aid*policy residuals
along with the regression line.

Appendix: Data set construction
(Data posted at www.cgdev.org)
In assembling a new data set for the present study, we imitated as closely as possible the
process followed by BD, consulting also the authors (although they are of course not
responsible for any errors we make). We collected all data available from standard crosscountry sources. We also collected new data on black market premium. (See Table A–1.)
The BD and new data sets differ somewhat. Each contains observations for certain
variables that the other lacks, and the two do not agree perfectly on overlaps. (See Table
A–2.) BD have some observations that we were not able to reproduce for 1970-93 with
our more recent data sources, perhaps because data was reclassified as missing in
subsequent updates.

Updating the Sachs-Warner openness variable
The set of Sachs-Warner values from Harvard’s Center for International Development
stops in 1992. In order to extend the study period, we updated the Sachs-Warner (1995)
openness variable for 1993–98 for those countries with otherwise complete observations
for 1994–97, and for some other countries. The process of updating also led us to revise
pre-1993 values for ten countries.
The Sachs-Warner variable is based principally on five components. When a country is
rated “closed” on any one of the components, it is rated closed overall. Sachs and Warner
also drew on other sources on an ad hoc basis. Table A–4 describes the five components
and how they were updated for countries in the present study.

1994-95; black market exchange rate for 1994-95 from ICA,
various editions; CDI, various editions; official exchange
rate from IMF 2002. Algeria, Haiti, Iran, Myanmar, Nigeria,
Syria rated closed through 1998. Ethiopia rated closed 1993–
96. Kenya and Uganda rated closed 1993–94. Zambia rated
closed 1993 and 1998.
Export marketing: “closed” if
government has a purchasing
monopoly on a major export
crop and delinks purchase
prices from international prices.
Sub-Saharan Africa only.

Based on late-1992 status from World Bank 1994, p. 239,
and on late-1990’s IMF country reports. Absence of
evidence in IMF documents of such intervention is
interpreted as evidence of absence. Cameroon and Republic
of Congo rated open 1993–98. Madagascar rated open 1997–
98. All other countries in present study unchanged since
1992.

Socialist

Based on CIA 2002. Republic of Congo rated non-socialist
1991–97 but socialist in 1998. Ethiopia rated non-socialist
1992–98. Nicaragua rated non-socialist for 1991–98. All
other countries in study unchanged since 1992.
