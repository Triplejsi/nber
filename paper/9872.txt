Heckscher-Ohlin Theory and Individual Attitudes Towards Globalization
Kevin H. O’Rourke
NBER Working Paper No. 9872
July 2003
JEL No. F1, F2
ABSTRACT
The aim of the paper is to see whether individuals' attitudes towards globalization are consistent with
the predictions of Heckscher-Ohlin theory. The theory predicts that the impact of being skilled or
unskilled on attitudes towards trade and immigration should depend on a country's skill
endowments, with the skilled being less anti-trade and anti-immigration in more skill-abundant
countries (here taken to be richer countries) than in more unskilled-labour-abundant countries (here
taken to be poorer countries). These predictions are confirmed, using survey data for 24 countries.
Being high-skilled is associated with more pro-globalization attitudes in rich countries; while in
some of the very poorest countries in the sample being high-skilled has a negative (if statistically
insignificant) impact on pro-globalization sentiment. More generally, an interaction term between
skills and GDP per capita has a negative impact in regressions explaining anti-globalization
sentiment. Furthermore, individuals view protectionism and anti-immigrant policies as complements
rather than as substitutes, which is what simple Heckscher-Ohlin theory predicts.

1. Introduction
The factor proportions theory of trade developed by Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin is so
intuitively appealing that it remains the bedrock of modern trade courses. Despite its popularity,
however, doubts have persistently been raised about its empirical applicability, from the Leontief
paradox (Leontief 1953) to the stylized facts (high levels of intra-industry trade; high levels of
trade between similar countries) which motivated the development of new trade theory in the
1980s. In an influential paper which was particularly damaging to the theory’s credibility,
Bowen, Leamer and Sveikauskas (1987) showed that the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek model was of
no help when trying to predict the net factor content of a country’s trade.
However, recent work by Don Davis, David Weinstein and others has suggested that
Heckscher-Ohlin theory does indeed help to explain trade patterns, so long as the researcher
bears in mind the fact that countries are not distinguished by differences in factor endowments
alone; for example, Davis and Weinstein (2001) show that Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek theory is
consistent with the data, as long as it is modified to take account of the (self-evidently true) facts
that technology differs across countries, that factor price equalization does not hold, that some
goods are non-traded, and that international trade is not costless.
In this paper, I take an entirely different approach in assessing the empirical usefulness of
Heckscher-Ohlin theory. I do not ask whether it explains trade patterns, which is what the theory
is supposed to do; rather, I ask whether individuals’ attitudes towards globalization (and more
specifically, their attitudes towards trade and immigration) are consistent with factor proportions
theory. In particular, I start from the premise that trade and migration patterns are today driven
largely by differences in the relative endowments of skilled and unskilled labor in different

1

countries; it follows from Heckscher-Ohlin theory that skilled and unskilled workers should
differ in their attitudes towards globalization, in a predictable manner. Do these predictions hold
true, when confronted with the data?
In a series of papers Kenneth Scheve and Matthew Slaughter have addressed these issues,
and found evidence for the Heckscher-Ohlin world view. Scheve and Slaughter (2001a)
examined individual-level survey data for the US in 1992 and found that low-skilled workers
were more likely to support ‘new limits on imports’ than high-skilled workers; they also found
that factor type (i.e. skill level) was more important than the sector in which individuals were
employed in explaining preferences. This finding was consistent with Heckscher-Ohlin models
in which factors of production are mobile between sectors, but inconsistent with specific factors
models in which agents are intersectorally immobile. Scheve and Slaughter (2001b) use US
survey data for 1992, 1994 and 1996 to examine attitudes towards immigration. They find that
high-skilled workers are less likely to support restrictionist immigration policies than their lowskill counterparts.
While such findings may be consistent with a Heckscher-Ohlin world view, single
country studies cannot convincingly demonstrate that factor proportions models are relevant in
explaining individual preferences regarding globalization. The reason is straightforward:
Heckscher-Ohlin theory predicts that the impact of skill on attitudes should vary in a systematic
way across countries. In skill-abundant countries, high-skilled workers should favor trade; in
low-skill-abundant countries, it is the unskilled who should favor trade. The Scheve and
Slaughter findings, on their own, do not preclude the possibility that the high-skilled are in favor
of globalization everywhere – for example, because better educated people understand the

2

intellectual arguments in favor of international integration. Such a world would be at dramatic
variance with the predictions of Heckscher-Ohlin theory.
In order to test the theory, therefore, we need data giving attitudes towards globalization
in a number of different countries. The crucial issue then becomes whether the relationship
between skills and attitudes varies across countries in a manner consistent with theory. This
paper will survey recent attempts to do precisely this, looking separately at attitudes towards
trade and attitudes towards immigration, and drawing on my work with Richard Sinnott
(O’Rourke and Sinnott 2001, 2003).1 The next section will discuss what theory has to say about
how individuals in different countries should feel about trade and immigration. Section 3 will
outline the data used, while section 4 will discuss the determinants of individual attitudes
towards trade. Section 5 discusses the determinants of individual attitudes towards immigration,
while section 6 uses seemingly unrelated bivariate probit methods to simultaneously explore the
determinants of attitudes towards both trade and immigration. Section 7 concludes.

2. Theoretical expectations
2.A. Trade
Standard Heckscher-Ohlin trade theory is quite clear in its predictions regarding who
should benefit and who should lose from free trade in commodities. Imagine a two factor world
in which countries are distinguished only by their relative endowments of skilled and unskilled

Since beginning this project, Sinnott and I became aware of the independent work that
was being done on the same issues by Anna Maria Mayda and Dani Rodrik (Mayda and Rodrik
2001, Mayda 2003). While their findings confirm our own, they use different methods and
measures of skill, and the paper will allude to these differences when our own empirical findings
are discussed.

workers. The relative wages of skilled workers will be lower, other things being equal, in skill
abundant countries (which we will denote by R, and refer to as rich countries) than in unskilled
labor abundant countries (denoted by P, and referred to as poor countries): we have (wS/wUS)R <
(wS/wUS)P, where wS and wUS denote skilled and unskilled wages respectively. It is this inequality
that drives comparative advantage: the rich countries will export skill intensive goods, while the
poor countries will export unskilled labor intensive goods. The result is then relative factor price
convergence (or, in the limit, factor price equalization): when countries move towards freer
trade, the relative price of skilled labor rises in rich countries, and falls in poor countries.
Moreover, the abundant factor gains in real terms in all countries, while the scarce factor loses.
Thus the skilled should favor free trade in rich countries, while they should favor protection in
poor countries; the unskilled in rich countries should favor protection, while the unskilled in
poor countries should support free trade.
Note that Heckscher-Ohlin theory argues that individuals’ interests are related to
countries’ factor endowments; in order to test the theory, we ought in principle to see whether
the relationship between skills and protectionist sentiment varies across countries in a manner
related to their skill endowments (e.g. their average educational levels). For reasons outlined in
Section 3, however, the available educational data are not satisfactory, and in testing the theory
we assume that GDP per capita is strongly and positively correlated with human capital
endowments. We therefore have:

Prediction 1: the impact of skills on protectionist sentiment should be related to a country’s GDP
per capita. In the richest countries, being high-skilled should have a negative impact on

4

protectionist sentiment. In the poorest countries, being high-skilled should have a positive
impact on protectionist sentiment. More generally, an interaction term between skills and GDP
per capita should enter with a negative sign in a regression explaining protectionist sentiment.

2.B. Immigration
In a pure Heckscher-Ohlin world in which technology is identical across countries, and in
which countries are only distinguished by their relative endowments of skilled and unskilled
labor, it is again possible to make unambiguous predictions about who should favor immigration
and who should not. This is the case, even though international migration is not driven by
comparative advantage and relative factor prices, but by absolute advantage, and by absolute
factor price differentials. In a pure HO world, the real wages of skilled workers will be higher in
poor countries (where skilled workers are scarce) than in rich countries (where they are
abundant), while unskilled wages will be higher in rich countries than in poor countries: we have
(in real terms) wSP > wSR, but wUSR > wUSP. Thus, we should observe skilled workers migrating
from rich to poor countries, and unskilled workers migrating from poor to rich countries.
Immigration will hurt skilled workers in poor countries, but benefit the unskilled there; therefore
in poor countries the unskilled should favor immigration, while skilled workers should oppose it.
The situation is the reverse in rich countries: immigration will hurt the unskilled, but benefit
skilled workers. Thus skilled workers should be pro-immigration, while the unskilled should
oppose it.
We thus have:

5

Prediction 2: the impact of skills on anti-immigrant sentiment should be related to a country’s
GDP per capita. In the richest countries, being high-skilled should have a negative impact on
anti-immigrant sentiment. In the poorest countries, being high-skilled should have a positive
impact on anti-immigrant sentiment. More generally, an interaction term between skills and GDP
per capita should enter with a negative sign in a regression explaining anti-immigrant sentiment.

Note that in such a pure 2-country, 2-factor Heckscher-Ohlin world, in which countries
are distinguished solely by their relative factor endowments, agents are consistent in their
attitudes towards globalization. That is, in rich countries skilled workers favor both trade and
immigration, while unskilled workers are protectionist and anti-immigration. In poor countries, it
is the unskilled who are liberal in their attitudes towards both trade and immigration, while the
skilled favor both protection and immigration restrictions. This symmetry reflects the fact that in
a pure 2-factor Heckscher-Ohlin world in which technology is identical across countries, trade
and factor flows are substitutes: they have identical effects on factor prices (i.e. they both lead to
relative and absolute factor price convergence), and thus the more you have of one dimension of
globalization, the less incentive there will be for the other dimension to take place. In such a
world, scarce factors lose as a result of either trade or immigration, while abundant factors gain
from either. One immediate political consequence of the fact that trade and migration are
substitutes for each other is that agents who are protectionist should also be anti-immigration:
both trade and immigration have to be simultaneously restricted, since either phenomenon will
hurt the scarce factor. Protection without immigration restrictions will not work, since protection
without immigration restrictions will simply lead to more immigration; immigration barriers

6

without protection will not work, since immigration barriers on their own will simply lead to
more trade (Mundell 1957).
We thus have:

Prediction 3: ceteris paribus, being protectionist should increase the likelihood that an
individual is anti-immigrant; while ceteris paribus, being anti-immigrant should increase the
likelihood that an individual is protectionist.

Things get a lot more complicated if technology differs across countries, or if there are
more than two factors of production. Any test of Heckscher-Ohlin theory will in all likelihood do
better by admitting such possibilities (recall that it is precisely by admitting the existence of such
complications that the empirical trade literature has to some extent rehabilitated the theory in
recent years). If technology is better in the rich country, or if the rich country is better endowed
with some third factor of production than the poor country, then it no longer follows from an
inequality such as (wS/wUS)R < (wS/wUS)P that skilled workers will migrate from rich to poor
countries: it is quite possible that (wS/wUS)R < (wS/wUS)P, but that (in real terms) wSR > wSP. In
this case, skilled workers will move from poor (unskilled labor abundant) countries to rich (skill
abundant) countries: unskilled workers will move in the same direction as skilled workers. This
is, of course, what happens in the real world, suggesting that richer countries do indeed enjoy
superior technology to poor countries, and that endowments alone cannot explain differences in
income, or for that matter trade patterns and factor flows. The issue of whether skilled or
unskilled workers should be more anti-immigration in rich countries thus becomes unclear.

7

Presumably it depends upon whether immigration predominantly involves skilled or unskilled
workers; but which is true is not immediately obvious.2
In fact, there is a large theoretical literature which asks whether migrants are more likely
to be skilled or unskilled, but this literature tends not to be located within standard HO trade
models. For example, Katz and Stark (1984) argue that asymmetric information can lead to
migration flows disproportionately involving unskilled workers, since employers in rich
countries may not be able to correctly discern the skill levels of potential migrants; although the
equilibrium outcome can change if various devices reinstating informational symmetry are
employed (Katz and Stark 1987). While appealing, it is not clear to me how this theory could be
empirically tested with the data at my disposal.
An alternative theory is provided by Borjas (1987), who adapts Roy’s (1951) model of
occupational self-selection to the issue of migration. The conclusion of the analysis is that there
will be positive self-selection of migrants if (a) the correlation between the earnings which they
receive in the home and destination countries is sufficiently high; and (b) if income is more
dispersed in the destination country than in the home country. On the other hand, there will be
negative self-selection if (a) the correlation between the earnings which they receive in the home
and destination countries is sufficiently high; and (b) if income is less dispersed in the
destination country than in the home country. The theory thus predicts that immigrants into more

Furthermore, it is no longer the case that trade and factor flows are necessarily
substitutes: they could instead be complements. For example, Markusen (1983) shows that
technological differences between countries can lead to trade and factor mobility being
complements; while in the context of a three-factor model such as the specific factors model,
trade and factor mobility can be either substitutes or complements (O’Rourke and Williamson
1999, Chapter 13).

unequal countries should be higher-skilled than immigrants into more equal countries: it follows
that the high-skilled should be less favorably disposed towards immigrants in more unequal
countries than in more equal countries. We have:

Prediction 4: the impact of skills on anti-immigrant sentiment should be related to a country’s
level of inequality. In the most unequal countries, being high-skilled should have a positive
impact on anti-immigrant sentiment. In the most equal countries, being high-skilled should have
a negative impact on anti-immigrant sentiment. More generally, an interaction term between
skills and inequality should enter with a positive sign in a regression explaining anti-immigrant
sentiment.3

3. The data4
The 1995 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) module on national identity
provides the kind of cross-country survey data that are needed to test the hypotheses outlined
above. The ISSP national identity survey was conducted in twenty-four countries in 1995-96.
The countries concerned were: Australia, West Germany, East Germany, Great Britain, the USA,
Austria, Hungary, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the Czech Republic,

In principle, self-selection should depend not only on income distribution within host
countries, but on the relationship between host country and source country income distribution.
A complete test of the Borjas theory would thus involve calculating source country distributions
for each host country. In this paper I make the simplifying assumption that source country
distributions are sufficiently similar for all host countries that self-selection varies across host
countries based on differences in host country distributions alone.

and Slovakia.
The survey provides two questions that are relevant in assessing attitudes towards
globalization. The first asks respondents how much they agree or disagree with the statement
that their country ‘should limit the import of foreign products in order to protect its national
economy’. The second asks respondents if the number of immigrants to their economy should be
increased a lot (1), a little (2), remain the same (3), be reduced a little (4) or reduced a lot (5).
Table 1 reports the mean response to these questions in each country: a score greater than 3
indicates that on average respondents were leaning towards greater restriction, rather than freer
trade or immigration. In every country in the sample, respondents on average favored lowering
the number of immigrants; in every country in the sample bar two (the Netherlands and Japan)
respondents on average favored limiting imports.
Answers to these two questions constitute the dependent variables that are to be
explained in the analysis which follows. The data set also provides individual-level measures of
a range of demographic, socio-economic and political variables that are of relevance in
understanding attitudes towards globalization. Among the socio-economic variables, the most
valuable from the point of view of testing the implications of the theories surveyed earlier is the
respondent’s skill level. This is arrived at by coding the answers to questions on respondents’
occupation using the International Labor Organisation’s ISCO88 (International Standard
Classification of Occupations) coding scheme. While a complex coding scheme of this sort
allows for very fine distinctions between different occupations, it makes most sense to focus on
the four main skill categories provided by ISCO88. In brief, these are: (1) ‘elementary

10

occupations’ (i..e. ‘manual labor and simple and routine tasks, involving…with few exceptions,
only limited personal initiative’ (ILO 1990, p.7)); (2) ‘plant and machine operators and
assemblers; craft and related trades workers; skilled agricultural and fishery workers; service
workers and shop and market sales workers; clerks;’ (3) ‘technicians and associate
professionals;’ and (4) ‘professionals.’ A fifth group, ‘legislators, senior officials and managers,’
do not have a skill coding under this four-step skill classification and were included as a
separate, fifth, skill category. Finally, members of the armed forces were excluded, since it was
unclear what their skill levels were. Skill data were available for 20 of our 24 countries; the other
four (Spain, Italy, Sweden and Japan) were omitted when estimating models involving skill.
The analysis also uses a subjective economic variable, namely the stated willingness of
people to move from one location to another in order to improve their standard of living or their
work environment. Respondents were asked: “If you could improve your work or living
conditions, how willing or unwilling would you be to move to another neighbourhood or village;
another town or city within this county or region; another county or region; outside [named
country]; outside [named continent]?” Based on the responses to these questions, two binary
variables were derived, indicating whether or not individuals were nationally mobile, and
internationally mobile.5 Arguably, those willing to relocate within the country should be less
affected by any dislocation implied by immigration or free trade than those who are immobile.
This will be particularly true if national labor markets are not perfectly integrated; and if
immigrants tend to concentrate in particular regions or cities, or if import-competing industries
are similarly concentrated. The rationale behind including the international mobility variable is

to test Rodrik’s (1997) argument that globalization is currently favoring internationally mobile
factors of production (i.e. physical and human capital) over immobile factors such as unskilled
labor; alternatively (in the context of migration), being willing to live overseas may signal an
openness to other cultures, and hence a greater tolerance for immigrants. The survey also
indicates whether the respondent had ever lived abroad; previous experience of living abroad
may provide a signal regarding willingness to move again (or, again in the context of
immigration, it may indicate familiarity with foreigners). In addition, the survey provides
information on respondents’ age; their gender; their religion; on whether they and their parents
are native born or not; on their marital and employment status; and on a variety of other personal
characteristics and attitudes.
The ISSP national identity data set includes a wide range of indicators of nationalist
attitudes. The analysis here focuses on the following seven questions (versions implemented in
Ireland, other country/nationality labels substituted as appropriate):

•

“Generally speaking, Ireland is a better country than most other countries”

•

“The world would be a better place if people from other countries were more like the
Irish”

•

“I would rather be a citizen of Ireland than of any other country in the world”

•

“It is impossible for people who do not share Irish customs and traditions to become fully
Irish”

•

“People should support their country even if the country is in the wrong”

•

“Ireland should follow its own interests, even if this leads to conflicts with other nations”

12

•

“How important do you think each of the following is for being truly Irish?”... ... ...“to
have been born in Ireland”

In each case, respondents were asked to rank their responses along a scale, in the case of
the first six items, from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) and, in the case of the seventh
item, from 1 (very important) to 4 (not at all important). The seventh item was reordered to make
it consistent with the other six. Principal components analysis of these responses yielded two
factors or underlying dimensions of nationalist attitudes. As can be seen from the rotated factor
loadings in Table 2, the first factor is a straightforward preference for and sense of the
superiority of one’s own country (here labeled patriotism). The second factor identifies a narrow
or exclusive sense of nationality combined with a degree of chauvinism of the “my country right
or wrong” variety (here labeled chauvinism). On the basis of this analysis, patriotism and
chauvinism scores have been calculated by averaging responses across the relevant subsets of
items identified in the factor analysis.
Finally, in order to test the various hypotheses outlined in the previous section, data on
GDP per capita in 1995 were collected from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators
(these are PPP-adjusted figures, in 1995 international dollars); the same source yielded
information on inequality (i.e. Gini coefficients).6 Data on educational attainments are also
available; the standard source is the Barro and Lee (2000) dataset on average years of schooling
in each country. However, the transition countries account for 9 of the 24 countries in the ISSP
dataset, and the Barro-Lee figures for schooling in several transition countries are very high: for

example, average schooling is higher in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Latvia and Poland than in the
Netherlands, Ireland, and Austria. It seems reasonable to doubt whether these figures provide a
genuine reflection of the economically relevant human capital endowments of these countries; it
is for this reason that GDP per capita data are used when testing Heckscher-Ohlin theory.

4. Understanding protectionist preferences
Table 3 presents results of a series of ordered probit regressions in which the dependent
variable is ‘protect’, an ordered variable running from 1 (least protectionist) to 5 (most
protectionist). The results differ from those presented in O’Rourke and Sinnott (2001) in that the
specification of the equations is altered to make them more comparable with the results for antiimmigrant sentiment.7
The first equation shows that nationalist sentiment is an extremely strong determinant of
attitudes towards trade, with patriotism, and especially chauvinism, having a large positive effect
on protectionist sentiment. This result is robust across all specifications, and confirms the
importance of ideology in determining attitudes towards globalization.
Is there also a role for interests in shaping voter preferences? The other equations suggest
that there is. Equation (2) provides a test of Prediction 1. It adds a skill variable, Skill345, to the
specification, as well as an interaction term between Skill345 and GDP per capita. Skill345 is a

Note that in the context of an ordered probit model, a significant positive coefficient
indicates that increasing the relevant independent variable increases the probability that ‘protect’
takes on the value 5, and reduces the probability that ‘protect’ takes on the value 1. The impact
on the probabilities that ‘protect’ takes on the values 2-4 is however a priori unclear.
Nonetheless, in what follows I will speak loosely of variables being either positively or
negatively related to anti-globalization sentiment. See Greene (2000, pp. 875-879) for further
details.

variable indicating whether the respondent is high-skilled or not; it is equal to one if the
respondent belongs to one of the three high-skill categories mentioned earlier (categories 3, 4
and 5) and zero otherwise. The results are a triumphant confirmation of Heckscher-Ohlin theory,
in that the interaction term between Skill345 is negative and statistically significant. It is in fact
the case that the high-skilled are more likely to support free trade in rich countries than in poor
countries, just as the theory predicts. This result is also robust across specifications.
Equation (3) adds a variety of control variables to the regression, but the basic
Heckscher-Ohlin result remains. A stated willingness to move within the country has no impact
on attitudes, but international mobility is associated with free trade preferences, consistent with
Rodrik (1997). Women and Roman Catholics tend towards more protectionist viewpoints, while
there is no evidence that the unemployed tend to be more protectionist.
How important quantitatively is this Heckscher-Ohlin effect? Taking the specification in
equation (3), and setting all right hand side variables equal to their median values, the expected
probability that a respondent will give the most protectionist response possible (protect = 5) is
31.5%. In a country with a per capita GDP of $5000, being high-skilled reduced this probability
by just 2.3%; but being high-skilled reduces the probability by 5.6% in a country with a per
capita GDP of $15000, and by 8.7% in a country with a per capita GDP of $25000. It appears
that income matters a lot in determining the impact of being high-skilled on preferences.8
Finally, equation (4) tests Prediction 3 by adding a measure of anti-immigrant sentiment.
Prediction 3 is vindicated, in that those who are more anti-immigrant also tend to be more

These results, and similar ones quoted in the next section, were calculated using the
CLARIFY programme described in Tomz, Wittenberg and King (1999) and King, Tomz and
Wittenberg (2000).

protectionist: trade and immigration policy are viewed as complements rather than as substitutes,
just as Heckscher-Ohlin theory predicts.
An alternative way of testing Heckscher-Ohlin theory is to run a series of regressions for
individual countries, and see how the relationship between skills and protectionist sentiment
which comes out of these regressions varies across countries. Appendix Table 1 gives the result
of a series of country-specific regressions, which include most of the variables in equation (3) of
Table 3.9 Figure 1 plots the coefficients on Skill345 for each of these countries, against that
country’s GDP per capita. Again, Prediction 1 is confirmed, in that there is clearly a negative
relationship between the impact of skill on protectionist attitudes, and GDP per capita. Indeed, in
three of the poorest countries in the sample (Latvia, Slovakia and Bulgaria) being high-skilled is
actually associated with being more protectionist, rather than less protectionist, although the
effects are small and statistically insignificant. Ideally, of course, one would like to have
information on even poorer countries, and see if skills are strongly and positively related to
protectionist preferences, but this is not possible with the ISSP dataset.
The robustness of these results is confirmed by Mayda and Rodrik (2001), who
independently arrived at the same conclusions using slightly different methods and
specifications. In particular, they
•

ran ordered logit rather than ordered probit regressions

•

used years of education rather than occupational skill-level to measure human capital

•

use other control variables, such as individuals’ relative incomes, and their sector of

Country dummy variables are obviously omitted from these regressions, as is the
interaction term between Skill345 and GDP.

employment (which they infer from the data on occupations).
Despite these differences, their basic findings are strikingly similar to the ones presented here.
Moreover, the Heckscher-Ohlin results carry over when Mayda and Rodrik employ data for a
larger sample of countries (taken from the World Values Survey). It appears that peoples’
preferences regarding trade policy are fully consistent with the predictions of factor proportions
theory.

5. Understanding anti-immigrant preferences
Table 4 presents the results of a series of regressions explaining ‘anti-immigrant’, which
is an ordered variable running from 1 (least anti-immigrant) to 5 (most anti-immigrant). The
same variables are used as in the previous analysis, and as before patriotism, and especially
chauvinism, are important determinants of anti-immigrant sentiment. Equation (2) tests the
unconditional version of Prediction 2, and this time the results are not favorable to HeckscherOhlin theory: the coefficient on the interaction term between Skill345 and GDP per capita is
negative, as expected, but the effect is statistically insignificant. Similarly, equation (3) tests the
unconditional version of Prediction 4, and again the results are disappointing for the Borjas selfselection theory. The coefficient on an interaction term between Skill345 and the Gini coefficient
is positive, as expected, but again insignificant.
Equation (4) tests a conditional version of Prediction 2, and this time the results are
favorable. Controlling for international differences in income distribution the interaction term
between Skill345 and GDP per capita is negative and statistically significant, just as theory
predicts. Moreover, controlling for international income differentials, the interaction term

17

between Skill345 and the Gini coefficient is positive and statistically significant, confirming a
conditional version of Prediction 4. These results remain robust when other control variables are
used (in equations 5 and 6), although the coefficient on the interaction term between Skill345
and GDP per capita becomes statistically insignificant at conventional levels in equation 6 (with
a p-value of 0.14).
How strong are these effects? Again, taking the specification in equation (5), and setting
all the explanatory variables equal to their median values, yields an expected probability of the
most anti-immigrant response of 49%. Assuming that the Gini coefficient is held at its median
value, 31.6, being high-skilled reduces the expected probability of the most anti-immigrant
response by 3.5% at a per capita income of $5000, but by 6.2% at per capita incomes of $15000,
and by 8.8% at per capita incomes of $25000. Assuming that per capita income is held constant,
at its median value for this sample of countries of $19270, being high-skilled reduces the
expected probability of the most anti-immigrant response by 9.4% when the Gini coefficient is
25, by 6.2% when the Gini coefficient is 35, and by only 2.9% when the Gini coefficient is 45.
The net impact of being high-skilled is positive for Gini coefficients of 54 and over.
As before, national mobility is unrelated to attitudes to globalization, but a stated
willingness to move internationally, or a history of such mobility, reduces the probability that a
respondent will express anti-immigrant opinions. Both natives and the children of natives are
more anti-immigrant, as are older people. In contrast with the results for trade, being a woman or
a Roman Catholic does not have a statistically significant impact on preferences (and the
coefficient for Roman Catholics is actually negative). Neither does being unemployed have any
such effect, which may seem surprising.

18

Finally, equation (6) tests Prediction 3, by including ‘protect’ as an additional
explanatory variable; protectionism is positively and statistically significantly correlated with
anti-immigrant sentiment, just as Heckscher-Ohlin theory would predict (although, as noted
above, when ‘protect’ is included in the specification the interaction term between Skill345 and
GDP per capita becomes statistically insignificant).
Again, another approach to testing the Heckscher-Ohlin and self-selection theories is to
run a series of regressions explaining attitudes towards immigration in individual countries, and
compare the coefficients on Skill345 across countries. Appendix Table 2 gives the results of
doing this using the specification in equation (5) (without country dummies or the two
interaction terms). Figure 2 plots the resultant coefficients on Skill345 for each country, against
that country’s level of GDP per capita. As can be seen, support for the HO predictions is in this
case unclear. There is indeed a negative relationship between the coefficient on Skill345 and per
capita GDP for the poorer countries in the sample (i.e. the Phillippines and the transition
economies of Central and Eastern Europe); and in two of the poorest countries, Latvia and the
Phillippines, the impact of skills on anti-immigrant attitudes is actually positive. However, for
the richer countries in the sample the relationship is unclear. This methodology provides much
stronger evidence for the Borjas theory: Figure 3 shows a clear positive relationship between the
Skill345 coefficient and the Gini coefficient.
Of course, Figure 2 just plots the bivariate relationship between the Skill345 coefficient
and GDP per capita; while the regressions in Table 4 control for a simultaneous relationship
between the Skill345 coefficient and inequality. It appears that the evidence for the predictions
of Heckscher-Ohlin theory is weak when the unconditional version of that theory is tested;

19

however, conditional on other factors the predictions of the theory hold up well. The Borjas
theory does better than factor proportions theory when tested unconditionally, but does even
better yet when tested conditional on other factors.
The above exercises are fairly simple in their methodology. However, Mayda (2003) has
recently and independently arrived at similar conclusions to these, using the same data set, as
well as the World Values Survey, but going into much greater detail and employing many
additional individual- and country-level variables to test the basic Heckscher-Ohlin predictions.
She uses both education and skills as measures of human capital, and runs probit regressions
explaining a dichotomous ‘immigrant opinion’ variable. Her results are even more favorable for
factor proportions theory than mine, even though she does not correct for differences in
inequality across countries. The findings in this section thus appear to be robust.

6. Explaining attitudes towards trade and immigration simultaneously
The previous sections have documented relationships between attitudes towards
globalization that conform well with factor proportions theory. One objection to the results,
however, is that they do not take adequate account of the fact that attitudes towards trade and
immigration are correlated with each other, and (crucially) that unobserved determinants of
globalization could have similar effects on both variables. Table 5 therefore presents the results
of seemingly unrelated bivariate probit regressions explaining attitudes towards both trade and
immigration. It estimates two regressions with the same explanatory variables as before, but
allows the disturbance terms in both regressions to be correlated with each other.10 The

10

20

dependent variables in both cases are binary variables, indicating whether the respondent gave
the most anti-globalization response possible: ‘Highly protectionist’ is 1 if ‘protect’ = 5, while
‘Highly anti-immigrant’ is 1 if ‘anti-immigrant’ = 5; otherwise both variables are zero. The
‘rho’ coefficient reported at the bottom is the correlation between the disturbances in the two
equations, or ‘(roughly) the correlation between the outcomes after the influence of the included
factors is accounted for’ (Greene 2000, p. 854). The results confirm Prediction 3 in that ‘rho’ is
strongly positive. Predictions 1, 2 and 4 are also confirmed, in that the interaction terms between
‘Skill345' and GDP per capita are negative, while the interaction term between ‘Skill345' and the
Gini coefficient in equation (2) is positive. National mobility now becomes an important
determinant of attitudes towards protectionism, and with the expected sign, while it remains
unimportant for attitudes towards immigration. Otherwise the results are fairly similar to those
obtained earlier.

7. Conclusion
Presumably the debate about to what extent factor proportions theory explains trade
flows will continue in the decades ahead. However, it appears that peoples’ attitudes towards
globalization are strikingly similar to those that would be predicted if Heckscher-Ohlin trade
theory accurately described the world. The high-skilled are pro-globalization in rich countries,
confirming the results of Scheve and Slaughter. Even more tellingly, in some of the very poorest
countries in the ISSP sample, being high-skilled has a negative (if statistically insignificant)
impact on pro-globalization sentiment. More generally, an interaction term between skills and
GDP per capita has a negative impact in regressions explaining anti-globalization sentiment.

21

Furthermore, individuals view protectionism and anti-immigrant policies as complements rather
than as substitutes, which is what simple Heckscher-Ohlin theory predicts.
