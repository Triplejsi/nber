JEL No. C51
ABSTRACT
Making use of restrictions imposed by equilibrium, theoretical progress has been made on
the nonparametric and semiparametric estimation and identification of scalar additive hedonic
models (Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim, 2002) and scalar nonadditive hedonic models (Heckman,
Matzkin, and Nesheim, 2002). However, little is known about the practical aspects of estimating
such models or of the characteristics of equilibrium in such models. This paper presents
computational and analytical results that fill some of these gaps. We simulate and estimate examples
of equilibrium in the additive hedonic models and provide evidence on the performance of several
estimation techniques. We also simulate examples of equilibria in nonadditive models and provide
evidence on the performance of the nonadditive estimation techniques developed in Heckman,
Matzkin, and Nesheim (2002).

Introduction

Hedonic models are general equilibrium frameworks that characterize the
pricing of diﬀerentiated goods, viewed as bundles of attributes, and the demand and supply of those goods (attributes) under diﬀerent assumptions
about preferences and technology. They allow for a systematic economic
analysis of the demand and supply of quality. Quality includes enhancement
of the attributes of a good embodied in a unit of the good (such as the attributes of a house or a car as in Rosen, 1974), characteristics of a job (risk
or unpleasantness as in Tinbergen, 1956, Sattinger 1975, 1980, 1993, and in
Thaler and Rosen, 1975) or the amenities oﬀered by an environmental or
recreational improvement (as in Smith and Huang, 1995 and Banzhaf, Sieg,
Smith, and Walsh, 2000). Understanding the structure of demand in markets for diﬀerentiated products is a crucial ingredient of models of monopoly
pricing (Wilson, 1993; Rochet and Stole, 2001; and Armstrong, 1996). The
hedonic model underlies general equilibrium analyses of local public goods
(Epple, 1987; Epple and Sieg, 1999; and Bayer, 2000) and models in which
social interactions are priced (Nesheim, 2001). The promise of the hedonic
approach is great. It oﬀers insight into the economics of variety and heterogeneity in product quality and worker skill which are hallmark features of
1

modern economies. It oﬀers a consistent approach to adjusting price indices
for quality and allowing for valuation of new goods (or environmental oﬀerings) that can be viewed as new packages of old attributes (Lancaster, 1966,
1975; Triplett, 2000; or the essays in Bresnahan and Gordon, 1997). With
hedonic models, it is possible to interpret wage data on heterogeneous labor,
to evaluate alternative policy proposals for workplace safety (as in Kniesner
and Leeth, 1988, 1995), to evaluate proposals to subsidize education and job
training (Teulings and van Rens, 2002; and Tinbergen, 1956), and to examine
their consequences for worker and Þrm welfare and for wage inequality.
The potential applications of hedonic models are myriad but their application and development, except in certain special cases, have been hindered
by computational diﬃculties, approximations that ignore the implications
of equilibrium in the hedonic model, and the widely held belief that identiÞcation of the structural parameters in a hedonic model is not possible
using data from a single market. Recent theoretical progress has been made
in understanding these issues making use of restrictions imposed by equilibrium. Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim (2002) and Heckman, Matzkin,
and Nesheim (2002) have shown that contrary to the widely held belief that
identiÞcation is impossible in a single market, nonparametric and semipara-

2

metric estimation and identiÞcation of scalar additive hedonic models (Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim, 2002) and scalar nonadditive hedonic models
(Heckman, Matzkin, and Nesheim, 2003) is possible.
However, little is known about the practical aspects of estimating such
models or of the characteristics of equilibrium in these two classes of models.
This paper presents computational and analytical results that Þll these gaps.
We simulate and estimate examples of equilibrium in these classes of hedonic
models and provide evidence on the performance of several estimation techniques. The simulations show the shapes of the pricing function that result
from various assumptions about the underlying structural parameters in the
economy. The estimation results demonstrate that structural parameters in
an additive economy can be precisely estimated. In addition, these results
demonstrate that in a nonadditive economy nonparametric techniques can
be used to recover estimates of the structural parameters.
In section 2 we present the general hedonic model. In section 4 we discuss
identiÞcation of the model and conditions suﬃcient for identiÞcation in the
additive and nonadditive cases. In section 5 we discuss estimation of the
model based on the earlier results. In section 6 we present simulation and
estimation results before concluding in section 7.

General Hedonic Model

We Þrst present a general statement of the classical hedonic model. For speciÞcity, consider a labor market setting. Our analysis applies more generally,
but it is useful to have a speciÞc example in hand. Assume a static model.
Consumers (workers) match to single worker Þrms. Workers are heterogeneous. They have characteristics (x, ε) where x ∈ X ⊆ Rnx and ε ∈ E ⊆ Rnε
are observable and unobservable (to the econometrician) characteristics that
aﬀect their utility from diﬀerent job types. Firms are also heterogeneous.
They have characteristics (y, η) where y ∈ Y ⊆ Rny and η ∈ H ⊆ Rnη are
observable and unobservable characteristics that aﬀect the output and proÞts
they obtain from diﬀerent job types. Job types have characteristics z ∈ Z
where Z ⊆ Rnz . Z is the set of feasible job types. For example, z could be
a (possibly multidimensional) measure of the riskiness of the job. Alternatively, in a housing market setting, z could be a vector of characteristics of
a neighborhood or a house. We focus attention on the classical case where
nz = nε = nη assuming a smooth equilibrium pricing function. This is the
hedonic model analyzed in Tinbergen (1956), Rosen (1974), Epple (1987)
and Kniesner and Leeth (1988, 1995). It is also the example that has dominated much of the literature on hedonic models. The theoretical analysis,
4

the simulation models, and the empirical results to follow in sections 4 and 6
restrict the analysis further and focus on the scalar hedonic model in which
nz = 1.
The distribution of consumer characteristics in the population is characterized by the density functions fx and fε both strictly greater than zero in
the interiors of X and E respectively. We assume x is independent of ε. Similarly, the distribution of Þrm characteristics are characterized by the density
functions fy and fη also strictly positive in the interiors of their respective
supports. y is independent of ε.
Workers of type (x, ε) choose jobs of type z to maximize utility. P (z) is
the earnings of workers supplying attribute vector z, which is a disamenity.
To focus on the main ideas, we study the quasilinear utility model (also
known as the transferable utility model in the assignment literature and in
the theoretical public economics literature. See Gretsky, Ostroy, and Zame,
1999 and Wooders, 1994). DeÞne U ∗ (c, z, x, ε) = c −U (z, x, ε) where x and ε
are as deÞned above and c is consumption. For simplicity assume c = P (z),
so workers consume their earnings. More generally, c = P (z) + R where
R is non-labor income, but for ease of exposition, assume R = 0. Workers
who don’t work get reservation utility V0 . We initially restrict our analysis

5

to economies for which the equilibrium price function is smooth. Similar
analyses can be done for economies in which the equilibrium price function
is not smooth. Smoothness is not a generic property of hedonic models,
even when the underlying preferences are smooth.1 Given P (z), a twice
continuously diﬀerentiable price function, and assuming the utility function
is twice diﬀerentiable, for those who choose to work we obtain the following
Þrst order conditions for a maximum

Pz (z) − Uz (z, x, ε) = 0.

(1)

The second order conditions (SOC) require that Pzz0 − Uzz0 be negative definite. Assuming the SOC are satisÞed and using the Implicit Function Theorem, (1) determines z = s (x, ε) , the quality of the good supplied by each
worker (x, ε) . Assuming Uzε0 is invertible it also determines the inverse mapping ε = se (z, x) . Note that se (z, x) implicitly depends on the marginal price

function Pz (z). The two mappings s (x, ε) and se (z, x) are the focus of both
our theoretical and empirical study of the classical hedonic model.

Firms of type (y, η) demand attribute z and maximize proÞts which are

Nesheim (2001), and Heckman, Matzkin, and Nesheim (2002).

6

equal to output Γ(z, y, η) minus production costs P (z) where y and η are deÞned above. We assume that the production function is twice diﬀerentiable.
If the Þrm hires no workers, reservation proÞts are Π0 . Otherwise, proÞts
are Π (z, y, η, P (z)) = Γ(z, y, η) − P (z) and the Þrst order conditions for a
maximum of each Þrm that enters the market are

Γz (z, y, η) − Pz (z) = 0

(2)

The second order conditions require that Γzz0 − Pzz0 be negative deÞnite.
Assuming the SOC are satisÞed and using the Implicit Function Theorem, (2)
deÞnes z = d (y, η) , the type of job demanded by each Þrm (y, η) . Assuming
Γzε0 is invertible, it also determines the inverse mapping η = de(z, y) . As on

the supply side, de(z, y) implicitly depends on the marginal price function

Pz (z) .

In equilibrium, the density of the demanded z must equal the density of
the supplied z for all values of z. To express this condition in terms of the
primitive functions, consider the transformation deÞned by the consumer Þrst
order conditions ε = se (z, x) and x = x. The Jacobian of this transformation

Observe that se (z, x) and de(z, y) implicitly depend on Pz and Pzz0 . In

addition, the solution depends on the structural parameters of the model:
technology of the Þrms Γ, the utility function U of the workers, and the dis-

tributions of Þrms and workers in the population (fx , fε , fy , fη ). Economic
theory implies that marginal products and marginal utilities are nonnegative in most cases. In order for agents to participate in the market, Þrms
and workers must receive wages and proÞts above reservation levels. If not,
equation (3) must be suitably adjusted. These criteria generate the boundary conditions that determine the solution of the diﬀerential equation for
equilibrium prices.
Equations (1) , (2) , and (3) and the data generated by them are the focus
of our analysis. They determine all the theoretical and statistical properties
of the model. In general, equations like (3) have no closed form solution,
except for the special case of the Tinbergen model, which is developed below
that is not identiÞed in a single cross section. While progress has been made
in understanding such equations in the mathematics and numerical analysis
literature little is known about their solutions in economics.2 The inability

cases of a scalar attribute has inhibited application of the hedonic model
to economic problems. It has also hindered understanding of the statistical
properties of hedonic models relevant to identiÞcation and estimation. Our
simulations presented in section 6 help remedy this problem. We Þrst present
the Tinbergen model which implicitly or explicitly has been the point of
departure for all empirical work on hedonics.

Tinbergen’s Linear-Quadratic Model

Assume preferences are quadratic in z and linear in c, unearned income R =
0, and that individual heterogeneity (x, ε) only aﬀects utility through the
single index θ = µθ (x) + ε where dim (θ) = dim (z) 3 . Consumers maximize

1
U(c, z, θ, A) = P (z) + θ0 z − z 0 Az.
2

The conditions determining a consumer maximum are

Pz + θ − Az = 0
3

The model in this example was Þrst analyzed by Tinbergen (1956) and has been used
by Epple (1987) and Tauchen and Witte (2001) among others.

10

where Pzz0 − A is negative deÞnite. On the Þrm side, assume the production
function is quadratic in z and that Þrm heterogeneity only aﬀects proÞts
through the single index ν = µν (y) + η where dim (ν) = dim (z). ProÞts are

1
Π (z, ν, B, P (z)) = ν 0 z − z 0 Bz − P (z)
2

and the conditions determining a Þrm’s optimum are

ν − Bz − Pz = 0

where −(B + Pzz0 ) is negative deÞnite. The distributions of θ and ν in
the population are normal. The distribution of θ is θ ∼ N(µθ , Σθ ), and the
distribution of ν is ν ∼ N(µν , Σν ).
An arbitrary price function induces a density of demand and a density of
supply at every location z. The equilibrium price function can be found by
equating these densities at every point z and solving the diﬀerential equation
(3) . However, in the linear-quadratic-normal case one can correctly guess that
the solution to the problem is quadratic in z

1
P (z) = π 0 + π 01 z + z 0 π 2 z
2
11

and then Þnd the coeﬃcients (π 0 , π 1 , π2 ) that satisfy the equilibrium equation. Assuming the price function is quadratic, the Þrst order condition for
a consumer is
π 1 + π 2 z + θ − Az = 0.

(4)

ν − Bz − π 1 − π 2 z = 0.

(5)

For a Þrm, it is

The second order conditions require that both A −π 2 and B +π 2 are positive
deÞnite. Thus we may solve for z from (4) to obtain

z = (A − π 2 )−1 (θ + π 1 )

(6)

z = (B + π 2 )−1 (ν − π 1 ).

(7)

and from (5) to obtain

These equations deÞne mappings from workers θ and Þrms ν to job types
z. These mappings determine the density of supply and demand at every
location and the types of workers and Þrms at every location. Equilibrium
is characterized by a vector π 1 and a matrix π 2 that equate demand and
12

supply at all z. However, since both θ and ν are normally distributed, this
only requires equating the mean and variance of supply and demand.
The mean supply E S (z) is obtained from (4):

(Average Supply)

E S (z) = (A − π 2 )−1 E (θ + π 1 )

The mean demand is obtained from (7):

(Average Demand)

E D (z) = (B + π2 )−1 E (ν − π 1 )

Since µθ = E(θ) and µν = E(ν), the condition E S (z) = E D (z) implies that

(Equality of means)

(A − π 2 )−1 (µθ + π 1 ) = (B + π 2 )−1 (µν − π 1 ) .

Rearranging terms, we obtain an explicit expression for π 1 in terms of A, B, µθ , µν
and π 2 :

π1 = [(A − π2 )−1 + (B + π 2 )−1 ]−1 [−(A − π 2 )−1 µθ + (B + π 2 )−1 µν ].

To determine π 2 , compute the variances of supply and demand from (4)

13

and (7) respectively to obtain:

ΣSz = (A − π 2 )−1 Σθ (A − π 2 )−1
−1
−1
ΣD
z = (B + π 2 ) Σν (B + π 2 )

where ΣSz is the variance of supply and ΣD
z is the variance of demand. From
equality of variances of the demand and supply distributions we obtain an
implicit equation for π2 :

(Equality of variances)

(A − π 2 )−1 Σθ (A − π2 )−1 = (B + π 2 )−1 Σν (B + π 2 )−1 .

We pin down initial conditions using the restrictions that U ≥ Ū, a reservation value, and proÞts are positive (Π ≥ 0). Equilibrium proÞts as a
function of location are

1 0
z (B + π2 )z − π0 . Hence nonnegativity of proÞts
2

implies −π0 ≥ 0 since (B + π 2 ) is positive deÞnite by the second order conditions. Setting reservation utility equal to zero, a similar argument on the
worker side implies π 0 ≥ 0. Hence π 0 = 0.
Once we have solved for π 1 and π 2 , (4) and (7) also deÞne the equilibrium matching function linking the characteristics of suppliers (θ) to those

14

of demanders (ν). For each z, this function is

(A − π2 )−1 (θ + π 1 ) = (B + π2 )−1 (ν − π 1 ).

Thus, the equilibrium relationship between θ and ν is

θ = (A − π 2 ) (B + π 2 )−1 (ν − π 1 ) − π 1 .

(8)

This relationship has important empirical implications as noted by Epple
(1987) and Kahn and Lang (1988). Conditional on location choice, worker
and Þrm characteristics are not statistically independent in equilibrium. There
is a functional relationship between them.
In the separable case where Σθ , Σν , A, and B are diagonal, π 2 is diagonal.
Eﬀectively, this is a scalar case. In the scalar case, equality of variances
implies that (A − π 2 )2 Σν = (B + π 2 )2 Σθ . Since the second order conditions
1

1

imply that A − π 2 > 0 and B + π 2 > 0. DeÞning σ θ = (Σθ ) 2 and σ ν = (Σν ) 2 ,
this means that4

π2 , the curvature of the price function, is a weighted average of the curvatures
of workers’ and Þrms’ preference and technology functions. π 1 is a weighted
average of the means of worker and Þrm distributions of heterogenity. In
both cases, the weights depend on the relative variances of worker and Þrm
heterogeneity. If workers are much more heterogeneous than Þrms σ θ >> σ ν ,
π2 will approximately equal B, the curvature of Þrms’ technology. If σ θ = σ ν
and A = B, π 2 = 0 is a solution and the equilibrium price function is linear in
z. If σ θ = σ ν , but A 6= B, then π 2 =

A−B
. In the polar cases when σ θ = 0
2

or σ ν = 0 then there is eﬀectively only one type of consumer or one type of
Þrm respectively. If σ θ = 0 and σ ν > 0, then π2 = A and π 1 = −µθ . Then
prices reveal the parameters of consumer preferences. If σ ν = 0 and σ θ > 0,
π2 = B and π 1 = µν . These two polar cases are discussed in Rosen (1974).
Only in these two polar cases do prices directly reveal consumer preferences
or Þrm productivities respectively. Similar results hold when z, θ, and ν are
vectors. We next turn to an analysis of identiÞcation in the general hedonic
model.

16

4

IdentiÞcation

The most direct approach to estimating hedonic models is to solve the second order diﬀerential equation (3) implied by equilibrium for P (z) in terms
of the parameters of preferences, technology and the distributions of tastes
and productivity and to jointly estimate the demand function corresponding
to (2) , the supply function corresponding to (1) and the distributions of unobservable preference and technology heterogeneity (fη and fε ) exploiting all
of the information in the equilibrium conditions including data on demand,
supply and the pricing function.
Rosen (1974) suggested an intuitively plausible and computationally simpler two step estimation procedure that has been widely criticized. In step
1 of his procedure, the analyst estimates P (z) from market data. In step
2, the analyst uses Þrst order conditions in conjunction with the marginal
prices obtained from step 1 to recover preferences and technology respectively. Suppose that consumer and Þrm Þrst order conditions (1) and (2) are
linear and z is a scalar. These are exactly the Þrst order conditions (4) and
(5) of the Tinbergen model. (The scalar assumption is made only to simplify
the argument and is not essential.) In this case, for the consumers, equation

17

(1) would be of the form

Pz (z) − Az + θ0 + θ01 x + ε = 0

(9)

For the Þrms, equation (2) would be of the form

−Bz + ν 0 + ν 01 y + η − Pz (z) = 0

(10)

Suppose further that the pricing function is quadratic as in Tinbergen (1956).
Then the Þrst stage of Rosen’s procedure would be to estimate the pricing
function P (z) = π 0 + π 1 z + 12 π 2 z 2 and recover estimates of π
b1 and π
b2 (“ˆ”
denotes estimate) and the marginal prices Pbz (z) = π
b1 + π
b2 z. The second

stage substitutes the estimated prices into (9) and (10) and estimates the
curvature parameters: Thus, Rosen proposed to estimate B and ν 1 from the
least squares regression

Pbz (z) = π̂ 1 + π̂ 2 z = ν 0 + ν 01 y − Bz + η.

18

(11)

A parallel proposal for preferences estimates A and θ1 from the regression

Pbz (z) = π̂ 1 + π̂ 2 z = −θ0 − θ01 x + Az − ε.

(12)

James Brown and Harvey Rosen (1982) analyze this method. They interpret
(11) and (12) as linearized approximations to the general Þrst order conditions for the model. The linear-quadratic-normal model of Tinbergen (1956)
is the framework in which these approximations are exact.
In this approximation interpretation, the distributions of η and ε are kept
in the background. Standard linear econometric methods are applied to identify the parameters of (11) and (12) and connections among the parameters
of preferences, technology and the distributions of tastes and productivity
are not made explicit. Issues of identiÞcation are confused with issues of estimation. Common to an entire genre of empirical economics, this literature
focuses on Þnding “good instruments” and misses basic sources of identiÞcation in hedonic models.
Starting from (11) and (12), Brown and Rosen (1982) make three points
that have been reiterated in the subsequent empirical literature. Point One:
IdentiÞcation Can Only Be Obtained Through Arbitrary Functional Form

19

Assumptions.

Since z is on both sides of (11) and (12), by a property of

least squares, a regression using the constructed price Pbz (z) = π̂ 1 + π̂ 2 z as

the dependent variable in (11) or(12) only identiÞes π 2 . In general, π 2 does
not identify any technology or preference parameter. In the special cases

where there is no variation in preference parameters ε or where there is no
dispersion in η, π 2 identiÞes preference (A) or production parameters (B)
respectively (See Rosen, 1974 or Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim, 2002).
However, if the constructed price is a nonlinear function of z, this argument no longer holds. The nonlinear variation in Pbz (z) gives an added

piece of information that can help to identify technology and preference parameters. This identiÞcation strategy works because it rules out collinearity
between z and Pbz (z) , but such nonlinearity is widely viewed as an artiÞcial

source of identiÞcation that is thought to be “arbitrary.” Theorem 1 in Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim (2002) proves that this nonlinearity is a generic
property of equilibrium in the hedonic model. In a parametric framework,
Nesheim (2001) shows that nonlinearity is a robust feature of a hedonic economy with social interactions. In the context of the Tinbergen economy, this
nonlinearity is generic.
Point Two: Endogeneity. Even if such “arbitrary” assumptions are made,

20

so that one can use the nonlinearity in Pbz (z) to help identify the parameters

and circumvent Point One, one still faces standard endogeneity problems. z

is correlated with η and ε in (11) and (12) respectively. Moreover, exclusion
restrictions from the other side of the market cannot be justiÞed. The equilibrium matching condition requires that η = −ε−(A+B)z −θ0 −θ01 x+ν 0 +ν 01 y
so that conditional on z there is a functional and statistical dependence connecting ε, η, z and the regressors. Conditional on z, η, ε, x and y become
stochastically dependent even if in the underlying population initially they
are mutually independent.
With data from a single market, one is forced to hunt for “clever” instruments with a questionable economic basis. Thus, even if “arbitrary” nonlinearities are invoked, standard instruments may be lacking. In Ekeland,
Heckman, and Nesheim (2002) we show that the economics of the model
guarantees valid instruments even though there are no exclusion restrictions.
In the particular case of equation (10) , when Pz (z) is nonlinear, E (z|y)
is not a linear function of y and so can be used as an instrument for z in
this equation. Hence, generically, E (z|y) is a valid instrument for z. This is
discussed at more length below and holds more generally.
Point Three: Use of Multimarket Data. Rosen (1974), Brown and Rosen

21

(1982), Epple (1987), and Kahn and Lang (1988) consider estimation of the
Þrst order conditions using multimarket data either across regions or across
time in the same region. In this case, if we assume that preference parameters
common across agents remain constant across markets while distributions
of individual heterogeneity vary across markets, we can use cross market
variation in prices and location choices to estimate the common preference
parameters. However, this identiÞcation strategy relies on assumptions that
can be tested if hedonic models can be identiÞed in a single market. Using
the techniques we discuss later in this paper, the structure of hedonic models
can be estimated and identiÞed using data from a single market for a class
of additive parametric structures that includes the linear model as a special
case.
Our results invalidate the interpretation that has been given to Brown
and Rosen’s criticism. What has been interpreted as an identiÞcation failure
is in fact the failure of an estimation procedure, coupled with an approach
that disregards basic sources of identiÞcation and mainly focuses on Þnding
exclusion restrictions.

In Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim (2002) and in

Heckman, Matzkin, and Nesheim (2002) we show that when there are no
unobservable attributes and some structure is put on preferences and tech-

nologies, everything can be identiÞed up to normalizations using single market data. In particular, Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim (2002) show that
putting an additive structure on preferences is suﬃcient for identiÞcation.
We describe these results in the next section. Alternatively, if the additive
structure is too restrictive or is rejected by the data, Heckman, Matzkin, and
Nesheim (2002) shows that in the nonadditive case alternative assumptions
on preferences can lead to identiÞcation. We describe these results in section
4.2. Both sets of results consider the case where z is unidimensional.

4.1

IdentiÞcation of the additive model

To show that the preferences and technologies generating an hedonic equilibrium price function can be identiÞed up to normalizations, using single market data and without any exclusion restrictions, suppose that z is one dimensional. Assume further that for unknown functions Mf and nf , the production function, Γ(z, y, η), of a typical Þrm is Γ(z, y, η) = Mf (z) + znf (y) + zη.
The Þrms’ Þrst order condition for proÞt maximization (2) becomes

Pz (z) = mf (z) + nf (y) + η

23

(13)

where mf (z) = ∂Mf (z) /∂z, and the second order condition is ∂mf (z) /∂z −
Pzz (z) < 0. This is a special case of (2) and is a signiÞcant generalization of
(10) ; it reduces to (10) when mf and nf are linear functions.
In a parallel manner, we may assume that the marginal utility is also of
an additive form. The Þrst order condition (1) of the worker becomes

Pz (z) = mw (z) + nw (x) + ε

for some unknown functions mw and nw . These equations are the empirical
equations we seek to estimate and the equations that generate the equilibrium
of the model through equation (3) .
In the empirical analysis, we focus on the Þrms’ equation. The analysis
is analogous for the workers. We have a dataset with observations on N
Þrms drawn at random from a single market. For each Þrm, we observe the
vector (Pz (z) , z, y) . These data are generated from the equilibrium of a single
hedonic market. This implies that for each Þrm, equation (13) holds where
η is unobservable to the econometrician, and mf (z) , nf (y) , and Fη , the
distribution of η, are to be estimated. We assume Pz (z) is known to focus on
the issue of identiÞcation and estimation of the structural parameters. In all

24

cases if Pz (z) is unknown because there is measurement error in prices, then
a two stage procedure can be implemented a la Rosen (1974). First, estimate
Pz (z) , then proceed to estimate (13) replacing the true price slope with the
estimated slope. Alternatively, (13) and the equilibrium price equation (3)
can be estimated simultaneously.
Much of the identiÞcation analysis is conducted independently of the
equilibrium equation (3); it studies the conditional cumulate distribution
function (CDF) of z implied by (13) and in particular makes use of the
transformation function5

T (z) = Pz (z) − mf (z) .

In terms of this function, the CDF of z is

Fz|y (z, y) = Fη (T (z) − nf (y))

(14)

where Fz|y (z, y) is the CDF of conditional on y evaluated at the point (z, y)
and Fη is the CDF of η. Diﬀerentiating (14) with respect to z and yi , the i0 th

the CDF Fbz|y the functions T (z) and nf can be estimated up to the three

unknown constants. This in turn determines mf (z) = Pz − T (z) . Fixing the
constants and Þxing y, the CDF of η can then be estimated as

Thus, the parameters mf (z) , nf (y) , and Fη (η) are identiÞed up to the
constants R1 , K1 , and C0 . The derivation of this results suggests an estimation procedure. First estimate Fz|y and calculate hi (z, y) . Then using Pz (z)
and the deÞnition of T (z) , recover mf , ny , and Fη from (16) , (17) , and (18) .
We develop this further in the next section.
The above procedure leaves the 3 constants undetermined. Additionally,
we can recover the parameter K1 if more information is available. If for
27

example, total output of the Þrm is observable, this information can be used
to recover an estimate of K1 . This is developed further in Ekeland, Heckman,
and Nesheim (2002). Alternatively, if it is known that mf (z) belongs to a
known Þnite dimensional vector space V so that mf (z) =

M

θj ξ j (z) where

ξ j are the basis functions of the vector space, then we can go one step further
and recover the unknown parameter K1 .

Theorem 2 in Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim (2002) proves that generically
Pz (z) does not belong to V. That is, generically Pz (z) is linearly independent
of mf (z) . As a result, a regression of Te (z) on Pz (z) , a constant, and the

functions ξ j for j = 1, ..., M will recover K1 .

This procedure suggests a two step estimator for K1 . First estimate Te (z)

b 1 is
and then run the regression of Te (z) on Pz (z) , ξ j , and a constant. K

to date is unfavorable. We develop an alternative estimator in section 5.1
that estimates a semiparametric version of the model using semiparametric

28

maximum likelihood where the Monte Carlo results are much better.

4.2

IdentiÞcation of the nonadditive model

Heckman, Matzkin, and Nesheim (2002) have shown that to be able to identify the preferences and technologies generating an hedonic equilibrium price
function, it is not necessary that the marginal utility and marginal product
functions be additive functions of the types speciÞed in Section 4.1. Under
certain conditions, one can identify nonadditive marginal utilities and nonadditive marginal product functions, using single market data and no exclusion
restrictions. Nonadditive speciÞcations for either of these marginal functions
are capable of generating a much richer set of equilibria, such as, for example,
equilibria exhibiting bunching. Hence, it is important to be able to allow for
these more ßexible types of speciÞcations when estimating preferences and
technologies.
Since the arguments for the identiÞcation and estimation of the marginal
product function are analogous to those used to establish the identiÞcation
of the marginal utility function, we will discuss only the latter. From the
analysis in Section 2, it follows that from the Þrst and second order conditions of proÞt maximization by a worker, we can establish the existence of

29

a supply function z = s(x, ε), where z denotes the quality or type of labor
supplied by a worker with observable characteristic x and unobservable characteristic ε. The function s is strictly increasing in ε if Uzε < 0. Assume, as
in the previous sections, that ε is distributed independently of x, then by the
arguments introduced in Matzkin (1999), and further developed in Matzkin
(2003), it follows that, subject to some normalizations, the function s and
the distribution of ε can be nonparametrically identiÞed from the conditional
distribution of z given x. Knowledge of the function s and of the distribution
of ε, together with knowledge of Pz , allow one to identify the marginal utility
function, from the Þrst order conditions of utility maximization. This last
step requires a separability restriction on the marginal utility function, of the
type studied in Matzkin (2002, 2003).
To present one such set of separability restrictions and normalizations,
suppose that for some unknown function m, which is strictly increasing in
its Þrst argument and strictly decreasing in its second argument

Uz (z, x, ε) = m (q (z, x) , ε)

where q is a known function, which is strictly increasing in each argument.

30

Normalize the values of the unknown function m, by requiring that for some
value x of x, and for all t

m (q (t, x) , t) = Pz (t)

Then, as it is shown in Heckman, Matzkin, and Nesheim (2002), under these
restrictions and normalizations, both the distribution of ε and the function
m, are nonparametrically identiÞed from the conditional distribution of z
given x.
The weak separability restriction in Uz allows one to recover the marginal
utility when the supply function is given. The normalization that Þxes the
value of the function m at one point of x allows one to recover the supply
function s and the distribution of ε from the conditional distribution of z
given x. To see this last point, note that the normalization restriction together
with the Þrst order conditions imply that for all ε

s (x, ε) = ε

31

since, when x = x and z = ε

Uz (ε, x, ε) = m (q (ε, x) , ε) = Pz (ε) .

The strict monotonicity of s in ε and the statistical independence between x
and ε, imply that, for all values of x and ε,

Fε (e) = Pr (ε ≤ e) = Pr (ε ≤ e|x) = Pr (s (x, ε) ≤ s (x, e))

and that

Pr (s (x, ε) ≤ s (x, e)) = Pr (z ≤ s (x, e) |x) = Fz|x (s (x, e)) .

Letting x = x, this implies that

Fε (e) = Fz|x (s (x, e)) = Fz|x (e)

Hence, we can recover the distribution of ε from the conditional distribution
of z given x = x. Next, since for all x and e, Fε (e) = Fz|x (s (x, e)) , it follows

32

that, under conditions guaranteeing that Fz|x is strictly increasing,

¢
¡
−1
−1
s (x, e) = Fz|x
(Fε (e)) = Fz|x
Fz|x (e)

(20)

Hence, we can recover the function s from the conditional distribution of z
given x. (See Matzkin (2003) for details.)
To see that under the separability restriction, the function m is identiÞed,
let (t1 , t2 ) denote a vector on the domain of m. Find x∗ such that

q (s (x∗ , t2 ) , x∗ ) = t1

(21)

Then, since by the deÞnition of m and the Þrst order conditions of utility
maximization

m (t1 , t2 ) = Uz (s (x∗ , t2 ) , x∗ , t2 ) = Pz (s (x∗ , t2 ))

(22)

it follows that, from knowledge of the function s and of the marginal price
function, we can recover the function m, which gives the values of the marginal
utility function (See Heckman, Matzkin, and Nesheim (2002) for details).
Estimation of the function m and the distribution of ε follows the steps

33

described above and is detailed in section 5.2.

Estimation

Several estimation techniques are available to implement the analysis presented in sections 4.1 and 4.2. All make use of the structure that the additive
and nonadditive models impose on Fz|y . In the case of the nonadditive model,
a fully nonparametric estimator is described in section 5.2. In the case of
the additive model, this information is suﬃcient to identify the structural
parameters up to location and scale. Additionally, if parametric restrictions
are placed on mf (z) in the additive model, the generic nonlinearity of the
hedonic model can be exploited to estimate the scale. To show how this
scale parameter can be estimated and for ease of exposition in developing
an estimator and presenting the estimation results for the additive model,
we focus on a semiparametric estimator that exploits knowledge of the functional forms of mf (z) and nf (y) but which makes no further assumptions on
the distribution of η. This estimator is semiparametric in that mf and nf are
known up to a Þnite dimensional parameter set while the distribution of η is
unknown. We also restrict the exposition to the case where the dimension of

34

y is 1. We develop this estimator for the additive model in the next section.

5.1

Estimation of the additive model

In our limited Monte Carlo investigations, we generate data from and develop
an estimator for speciÞcations of mf (z) and nf (y) in (13) that are linear in
the parameters. The Þrst order condition (1) may then be written:

Pz (z) =

We assume that a random sample of data on (Pz (zn ) , Pzz (zn ) , zn , yn ) for
n = 1, ..., N are available for a single market. To focus on the estimation of
preferences or technology we assume that Pz (z) and Pzz (z) are known. If
instead prices were observed measured with error, the technique described
below would need to be augmented to allow for estimation of the pricing
function. The technique exploits all the information in the model and uses
the generic nonlinearity in the model to identify not only the shape of the
marginal product function but also the scale.

Estimation of the nonadditive model

The most direct procedure to estimate the function m and of the distribution of ε in the nonadditive model follows the steps described in section
4.2. First, Fz|x is estimated nonparametrically using data on the joint distribution of (z, x) . this nonparametric estimator is Fbz|x Then this estima-

tor is substituted into equation (20). This deÞnes an estimator of s (x, ε) ,

Simulation and estimation results

In this section, we present simulation results from a range of speciÞcations
of 3 basic hedonic models. In each case, these simulations show the shape of
the equilibrium pricing function, the population density at each point z, and
the generic nonlinearity of the hedonic model. The accompanying estimation
results demonstrate the performance of the estimation techniques described
in sections 5.1 and 5.2.
Models 1 and 2 are examples of additive hedonic models. For these models
we study the equilibria for several sets of parameter values and study how
the shape of the equilibrium price varies with alternate parameter values.
Then we simulate data from these sample hedonic economies and test the
performance of the estimation techniques on the simulated data. For each
model we simulate data from 15 parameter speciÞcations. For each speciÞcation, we generate 100 independent samples each with 1000 observations.
Using these simulated data, we estimate the parameters using the technique
described in section 5.1. The mean and the variance of the parameter es-

39

timates are compared with the true parameter values used to generate the
simulated data.
Model 3 is an example of a nonadditive hedonic model. The estimation
technique that is used to estimate the parameters of the additive models is
not applicable to data generated from the nonadditive economy. Instead,
the technique from section 5.2 must be used. For model 3, we simulate data
from a sample economy and study the performance of the nonadditive model
estimator described in section 5.2.
All models are completely speciÞed by the Þrms’ technology Γ (z, y, η) ,
the workers’ utility U (z, x, ε) , and the distributions of Þrm and worker heterogeneity fy , fη , fx , and fε . For each model, these objects are speciÞed and
then standard numerical methods are used to approximate Pz (z) the solution to the equilibrium diﬀerential equation (3) . Throughout the exposition
below φ (x, µ, Σ) denotes the density function of a normal random variable
with mean µ and covariance Σ. Model 1 is a quadratic model with nonnormal heterogeneity. Model 2 is an additive model in which mf , nf , mw ,
and nw are low degree polynomials. For both models we discuss features of
the equilibrium price function, simulate data, and estimate the structural
parameters describing Þrm technologies. Model 3 is a nonadditive model in

40

which Þrms are homogenous and workers have Cobb-Douglas utility. It is
described further below.

6.1

Model 1: SpeciÞcation and simulation results

The simplest generalization of the normal-quadratic Tinbergen model is the
quadratic hedonic model with non-normal heterogeneity. This model speciÞcation imposes Nzf = 1 and Nν = 1 in equation (23) and in the analogous
equation for workers. However, in contrast to the classical Tinbergen model,
this model allows the heterogeneity parameters to be distributed as a mixture of normals. Details of model 1 are given in Table A1 in appendix A.
This table details the exact functional forms that describe the model.
For this model, preliminary investigations simulated pricing functions for
a large number of speciÞcations. In all of these speciÞcations, parameters
were restricted to cases where worker and Þrm heterogeneity were distributed
as mixtures of normals each with two components in the mixture. The extreme cases of these speciÞcations include the Tinbergen-normal case when
the weights on the two components of the mixture are 0 and 1 or 1 and 0. In
this set of speciÞcations the parameters that most aﬀected the shape of the
pricing function were the mean and variance of worker and Þrm heterogeneity

41

and the weights on the components of the mixture of normals distribution.
In all cases the curvature of the pricing function is a linear combination of
the curvatures of worker preferences and Þrm technologies. (See Ekeland,
Heckman, and Nesheim, 2002 and Heckman, Matzkin, and Nesheim, 2002).
From among the speciÞcations investigated we selected 15 to report here.
The speciÞcations are detailed in Tables A2 and A3. The tables list 5
speciÞcations. For each of these speciÞcations we allowed the parameter
λη1 = λε1 = λ to vary from 0.1, to 0.5, to 0.9.6 Thus there are 3 variations of
each of 5 speciÞcations. SpeciÞcations 1 and 5 represent two extreme cases
and speciÞcations 2-4 represent linear combinations of those cases.
The price functions associated with each speciÞcation are depicted in
Figures 1-20. For each economy, we display the slope of the price function,
the population density at each location z, and the curvature of the price
function. Figures 1-10 show how the slope, the curvature, and the density
vary as λ varies from 0.5 to 0.9 to 1.0. Figures 11-20 show how the slope,
curvature, and the density vary as λ varies from 0.0 to 0.1 to 0.5. The Þgures
largely tell the same story. When λ = 0.0 or 1.0, the slope is a straight
line, the curvature is constant, and the density is a normal density. However,
6

The cases in which λ = 0 and λ = 1, the Tinbergen, normal-quadratic cases, are
displayed in the Þgures for comparison.

42

when λ = 0.1 or 0.9 the slope is not a straight line, the curvature is not
constant, and the density is not a normal density. These deviations from the
Tinbergen case are even stronger when λ = 0.5. The Þgures also show that
the slope of the price function deviates most sharply from a straight line in
the two extreme cases, speciÞcation 1 and speciÞcation 5. All the Þgures
show however, that the curvature deviates strongly from a constant when
heterogeneity is not normal. The closer the distribution of heterogeneity is
to normal, the closer the curvature is to a constant.

6.2

Model 1: Estimation results

The pictures described in the previous section show that there is nonlinearity
in the marginal price function and non-constancy in the curvature of the price
function when heterogeneity is not normally distributed in the population in
this quadratic model. The question remains, is that nonlinearity suﬃcient
to estimate the structural parameters in the model with precision? To shed
light on this question, we generated data from the 15 speciÞcations described
in the previous section and in Tables A2 and A3 and estimated the Model 1

43

version of equation (23) ,

Pz (z) = −Bz + ν 0 + ν 01 y + η

We generated 100 datasets each of sample size 1000 for each speciÞcation
and then estimated the parameters B and ν 1 using the technique discussed
in section 5.1. The results are displayed in Tables A4, A5, and A6. Table
A4 displays results for each of the 5 speciÞcations listed when λη1 = λε1 =
λ = 0.5. Table A5 displays results for each speciÞcation when λ = 0.9 and
Table A6 displays results for each speciÞcation when λ = 0.1. The contrast
between Table A4 and Tables A5 and A6 give some indication of how much
the precision of the results deteriorate when the economy is closer to the
normal-quadratic Tinbergen economy which is not identiÞed.
First consider the results in Table A4. The bias of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is never larger than 0.04. The standard errors range
from 0.0349 in speciÞcation 1 to 0.287 in speciÞcation 4. SpeciÞcations 3 and
4 have the highest standard errors. Looking at Tables A2 and A3, these are
the speciÞcations in which the two components of the mixtures of normals
distribution are most similar. That is, these are the two speciÞcations that

44

are closest to being not identiÞed.
Table A5 and A6 investigate how the results in Table A4 change when λ =
0.9 and 0.1. In these cases, the distributions or worker and Þrm heterogeneity
are closer to being normally distributed and the price function is closer to
being linear. In these cases, the ML results are essentially unchanged. The
bias of the ML estimator is the same order of magnitude. The biggest increase
is for speciÞcation 4 when λ decreases from 0.5 to 0.1. In this case, the bias
of the ML estimator increases from 0.02 to 0.12. This is still less than 7% of
the parameter value. The standard errors of the estimates increase slightly.
The biggest increase when λ increases from 0.5 to 0.9 is in speciÞcation 1
when the standard errors increase from 0.0349 and 0.0518 to 0.12 and 0.194.
This is nearly a four-fold increase. Yet the standard errors after the increase
are still only 12% and 20% of the parameter values.
The results indicate that the ML estimator can provide very good parameter estimates in a range of speciÞcations. These results apply to the
linear-quadratic model of Tinbergen with non-normal heterogeneity and to
the linear approximations of Brown and Rosen (1982). Far from not being
identiÞed, the parameters are estimated with a high degree of precision.

45

6.3

Model 2: Simulation results

The results in Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim (2002) apply to additive models more general than the quadratic model. Model 2 generalizes Model 1 by
replacing the linear-quadratic terms in the production and utility functions
with nonlinear terms. Model 2 is detailed in Table A7. The speciÞcation
was chosen so that every function is a polynomial, ν (y) is strictly increasing (ν 1 > 0), θ (x) is strictly increasing (θ1 > 0), and mf (z) < mw (z) This
last restriction rules out bunching. The speciÞcation allows the curvatures
of utility and preferences to be ßexible and vary with z. It also allows for a
ßexible relation between preference heterogeneity ν (y) and observable Þrm
traits y. While the power series representations detailed in Table A7 could
be replaced with orthogonal polynomial representations or representations
based on other basis functions, the power series representations were chosen
for ease of exposition.
It was more costly in terms of computer time to simulate equilibria and
generate data from model 2. We studied a more limited set of speciÞcations.
In particular 5 speciÞcations were chosen at random from a compact parameter space. The Þve chosen are detailed in Tables A8 and A9. The parameters
that were allowed to vary across speciÞcations include β, ν 1 , µη , σ η , α0 , α1 ,

µε , and σ ε . These parameters govern the curvature of the Þrms’ technology,
the minimum slope of ν (y) , the mean and variance of unobservable Þrm heterogeneity, the curvature of worker preferences, and the mean and variance
of worker heterogeneity.
Figures 21-30 display the slope of the price function, the curvature of
the price function, and the density of z for speciÞcations 1 through 5. For
each speciÞcation, three variations are plotted; one with λ = 0.5, one with
λ = 0.9, and one with λ = 1.0. Similar graphs depicting the case in which
λ = 0.0 and 0.1 are available from the authors upon request. Clearly a wide
variety of shapes of the price function are possible. In all cases, it appears
as if the price function might be well approximated by a quadratic or a
cubic but there are sharp deviations from these shapes. Simple quadratic
or cubic approximations to the price function would miss these important
deviations. Also, noteworthy is the shape of the equilibrium density of z.
In all the cases displayed, this density has many modes and is far from
being a normal density. In particular, this model is capable of generating
equilibria in which there are nearly gaps in the range of products marketed.
In Þgure 21, the fraction of Þrms demanding z < 1 is positive and large,
the fraction demanding z ∈ (1, 2) is nearly zero (though positive), and the
47

fraction demanding z > 2 is positive and large. This gap in the product range
reßects two factors, the distribution of heterogeneity in the population, and
the curvature of preferences and technology.
The value of λ does not appear to have large impacts on the slope, the
price, or the density. It does cause deviations in the shapes of these objects
but not large ones. This lack of impact is likely to be an artifact of the
set of speciÞcations investigated. In all speciÞcations, the distribution of
Þrm heterogeneity is determined by both the distribution of ν (y) and the
distribution of η. Because ν (y) is a 5th order polynomial in y, the variance
of ν (y) dominates the variance of η in all speciÞcations. Hence, η only
has small local eﬀects on the equilibrium and does not have large non-local
impacts. Nevertheless, the model is far from the normal model since ν (y) is
far from being normal.

Model 2: Estimation results

Tables A10-A19 present the estimation results for model 2. Tables A10-A14
present results for speciÞcations 1 through 5 when λ = 0.5. Tables A15-A19
present results for the same speciÞcations when λ = 0.9. Results for the cases
where λ = 0.1 are omitted to economize on space. They are available from

48

the authors upon request; they are largely similar to those presented.
In all the speciÞcations estimated the ML estimator again performs very
well. In Table A10 for instance the true value of β 1 is 0.623. The average
estimate is 0.637. The bias is 2%. This degree of bias is typical of all parameters estimates across all speciÞcations. In all cases the bias has an order
of magnitude never larger than 0.03; in the range of 2-3% of the parameter
values. The standard error of the estimates of β 1 in Table A10 is 0.243 or
39% of the parameter value. In percentage terms this standard error is the
fourth largest standard error for any parameter in any of the speciÞcations.
The other large standard errors are β 1 in Table A15, and β 1 in Tables A13
and A18. The largest standard error obtained is the standard error of the
estimate of β 1 in Table A18 which is 0.405 or 63% of the true parameter
value. Standard errors for all other parameter estimates in all speciÞcations
are much lower than this. In Table A10 the second largest standard error in
percentage terms is the standard error on ν c1 which is 0.256 or 13.8% of the
parameter value. Most of the standard errors in Tables A10 through A19
range between 5% and 20%.
Thus, the ML estimator performs very well. Despite the high degree
of nonlinearity in these additive models, the technique recovers parameter

49

estimates with small bias and reasonable standard errors.

Model 3: Simulation and estimation results

When the data reject the additive speciÞcations above, alternative techniques
are required. Some techniques for estimating nonadditive models are developed in sections 4.2 and 5.2. To evaluate the small sample properties of
these estimators for economies where either the marginal utility function or
the marginal product function, or both, are nonadditive in the unobservable
characteristics, we consider an economy where workers diﬀer in the value
of the observable characteristic x and the unobservable characteristic ε. To
focus analysis on estimation of the utility functions we generate observations
from an economy with homogenous production technologies. The marginal
price function is given by the marginal product function. The speciÞcation
that we use is described in Table 1.

In this economy, proÞt maximization by each of the homogenous Þrms
implies that the Þrst order condition:

Aαz α−1 − Pz (z) = 0

and the second order condition:

Aα (α − 1) z α−2 − Pzz (z) ≤ 0

are satisÞed. Since all the Þrms have the same production technology, the
only possible equilibrium price function for this economy is given by

Pz (z) = Aαz α−1 .

This is an example of Rosen’s 1974 argument that when one side of the
market is homogenous, the price function directly reveals parameters of that
side of the market.
The Þrst order condition for utility maximization of a worker with characteristics (x, ε) is
Pz (z) − Bβz β−1 xβ−1 εδ = 0
51

(25)

and the second order condition is

Pzz (z) − Bβ (β − 1) z β−2 xβ−1 εδ < 0

Using the equilibrium price function, we get that the supply function of the
worker, describing the quality of labor supplied is

z=

as long as
Aα (α − 1) z α−2 − Bβ (β − 1) z β−2 xβ−1 εδ < 0

Hence, when A > 0, B > 0, ε > 0 and x > 0, if 0 < α < β, the equilibrium

52

price function is
Pz (z) = Aαz α−1
and the supply function of a worker with characteristic (x, ε) is

To evaluate the estimators for the marginal utility of the workers obtained
using the estimators developed in Heckman, Matzkin, and Nesheim (2002),
we will simulate observations for pairs (x, z) generated by this supply function
and the speciÞcations described above for the distributions of x and ε. We
will require that for some strictly increasing function m

Uz (z, x, ε) = m (zx, ε) .

The utility function described in Table 1 satisÞes this restriction. The true
function m is m (zx, ε) = βB (zx)β−1 εδ . Assuming the true function is unknown and assuming the true distribution of ε is unknown, we impose the

53

normalization that, for all t within the relevant domain,

m (tx, t) = Pz (t) .

Since the equilibrium marginal price function satisÞes: Pz (z) = Aαz α−1 , the
normalization implies that

m (tx, t) = Aαtα−1

We could choose any value for x, and use a transformation to modify the
true marginal utility function m and the true distribution of ε to be within
the set of marginal utilities and distributions that are consistent with the
normalization imposed by our particular choice of x. However, for simplicity,
we choose the value of x and of the other parameters to be such that the true
function m and the distribution of ε are consistent with the normalization
generated by that x. Our choices for the parameters are
A α B
β
δ x
.55 .3 .15 1.1 -.8 1.
The equilibrium marginal price function for this economy is depicted with
a solid line in Figure 31. The dotted lines represent bounds on feasible
54

marginal prices produced by the restriction that an equilibrium marginal
price must satisfy equation (25) for some (x, ε) and (x, ε) are elements of a
compact set.
Using these parameters and the derivations above we generated 100 independent samples each with 100 observations of (z, x) pairs. Using these
samples we estimated the distribution of ε, the workers’ supply function
z = s (x, ε) , and the marginal utility function m. To estimate the conditional distribution of z given x, bandwidths were chosen by cross validation.
Figure 32 displays estimates of the distribution function of ε. In both
panels of the Þgure, the solid line displays the true distribution function. The
dashed line displays an estimate. The dashed lines in the lower panel display
the median and average of the 100 estimates of the distribution function.
These track the true distribution function quite closely. The maximum gap in
the tails of the distribution is about 0.05. The maximum gap outside the tails
is negligible. The dotted lines in the panel plot the 5th and 95th percentile of
the estimates. The maximum gap between these two quantiles and the true
distribution function is about 0.2 . This graph shows that the nonparametric
estimate of the distribution function tracks the true distribution function very
well.

55

Figures 33 and 34 plot the estimates of the supply function (26) . The
upper panels display 3-dimensional graphs of this function. The lower panels
display cross sections of the function at particular values of x and ε. Figure 33
illustrates how well a single estimate of the supply function can do. Figure 34
illustrates the median and average estimate of the 100 independent estimates.
The dashed lines in the lower panels show that when ε = 3.45 or when
x = 0.62, the median and average estimates track the true supply function
with negligible error. The dotted lines depict the 5th and 95th percentile of
these estimates.
Finally, Figures 35 and 36 portray estimates of the marginal utility function. Figure 35 show how well a single estimate can do, showing the three
dimensional m (zx, ε) in the upper panels and the marginal utility m (zx, ε)
for Þxed values of ε and zx respectively in the lower two panels. Figure
36 illustrates the average and median estimates as well as the 5th and 95th
percentile. When ε is Þxed at ε = 3.45, the median and average estimates of
m (zx, 3.45) , plotted with dashed lines, track the true function with negligible error. Similarly when zx is Þxed at zx = 3.56, the median and average
estimates are indistinguishable from the true function. Again, the dotted
lines show the 5th and 95th percentile estimates.

Conclusion

Much of previous analysis of hedonic models has neglected to consider the
strong implications imposed by equilibrium on the data generated from a
hedonic model. In particular, strong restrictions on preferences and technologies like additive separability impose a great deal of structure on the
joint distribution of observable random variables. In this paper, we have
developed these points in our discussion and illustrated them with two computational examples. The graphical displays of equilibrium prices in the array
of models we consider demonstrate the strong nonlinearities that are generic
features of hedonic models. Nonlinearity in these models is not arbitrary, but
emerges quite naturally. This nonlinearity in conjunction with restrictions
like additivity allow for identiÞcation and estimation of the hedonic model.
In Þnite samples of size 1000, the semiparametric maximum likelihood technique performs well in recovering estimates of structural parameters in both
the linear-quadratic model and in model 2 where the nonlinearities in the
structure of the economy are more severe. Finally, in model 3, with sample
sizes of only 100, the nonparametric techniques developed for nonadditive
models work very well.
The structural parameter estimates obtained in these exercises are cru57

cial for any general equilibrium analysis that seeks to address the welfare
consequences of policy changes in hedonic markets. They are also crucial
for employing hedonic methods to correct cost of living indices for changes
in the characteristics of marketed goods. Without estimation of the structural parameters underlying a hedonic market, changes in the hedonic pricing
relationship are uninterpretable.

Note: In all speciÞcations both η and ε are distributed as mixtures of normals with two components. λη1 = λε1 = λ are the weights
on the Þrst components of these mixtures. λη1 and λε1 are constrained to be equal for economy of presentation. Each of the speciÞcations
above was simulated 5 times with 5 diﬀerent values of λ. The Þve diﬀerent values were λ = 0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.0. The two extreme cases
represent cases where the model reduces to the linear-quadratic normal model. Figures showing the shape of the pricing function in all cases
are displayed below. Estimation results are presented for the cases λ = 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9.
