ABSTRACT
In 1992, the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced new
insurance coverage for two preventive services– influenza vaccinations and mammograms.
Economists typically assume transactions occur with perfect information and foresight. As a test
of the value of information, we estimate the effect of consumer knowledge of these benefits on their
demand. Treating knowledge as endogenous in a two-part model of demand, we find that consumer
knowledge has a substantial positive effect on the use of preventive services. Our findings suggest
that strategies to educate the insured Medicare population about coverage of preventive services may
have substantial social value.

The Role of Consumer Knowledge of Insurance Benefits in the Demand for
Preventive Health Care Among the Elderly

Introduction
Although economists typically assume that economic transactions occur with perfect
knowledge, consumers in health care markets often demand medical care with very limited
information on product characteristics and prices, and frequently rely on providers to act as their
agents (Arrow, 1963). Educational interventions to increase consumers’ knowledge of the costs
and/or probable benefits of medical care are, however, feasible. In 1992, the United States
Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) introduced coverage for Medicare beneficiaries
of two preventive services not previously covered– influenza vaccinations and mammograms.
Since then, HCFA, which was recently renamed the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS), has used multiple communication strategies to inform beneficiaries of these benefits,
such as employing Medicare carriers to promote the use of preventive care in order to reduce the
risk of illness or avoidable hospitalization.
Previous research suggests that educational interventions can translate into increased use
of services in general, and of preventive services in particular. Using data from a household
survey conducted in the mid-1970s, Kenkel (1990) measured consumers’ health knowledge by
responses to a set of questions about the symptoms associated with diabetes, heart disease,
cancer and tuberculosis. He found that better informed consumers were significantly more likely
to visit a physician. Hsieh and Lin (1997) examined the effect of information on demand for
preventive care (tests for blood pressure and blood sugar levels, and urinalysis) among elderly
persons in Taiwan. Their measures of information were based on responses to questions about
symptoms associated with high blood pressure and diabetes, the type of tests necessary to detect
2

diabetes, and the consequences of poor diabetes or high blood pressure management. Their
results generally supported the notion that better informed respondents were more likely to
obtained the preventive services they studied.
The value of some policies to promote preventive service use has also been clearly
suggested by previous analyses. The cost of treating influenza or comorbidities related to it is
substantial in both the hospital and physician settings (McBean et al., 1993). Furthermore, the
cost-effectiveness of the vaccination has been documented in earlier studies (U.S. OTA, 1981;
Govert et al., 1994). In the case of the cost-effectiveness mammography screening among
elderly women, the evidence is not as convincing as influenza vaccination (Blustein and Weiss,
1998) due to the relatively earlier incidence of breast cancer in women. However, several recent
studies have demonstrated that the effectiveness-cost ratio of mammography screening for
elderly women can be high (Rosenquist and Lindfors, 1998; Wolstenholme, Smith and Whynes,
1998).
New evidence suggests that influenza vaccinations and mammograms among the elderly
increased between 1992 and 1997. In 1997, 62 percent of Medicare beneficiaries reported that
they obtained a flu shot compared to 44 percent in 1992, and 43 percent of women reported
obtaining a mammogram compared to 19% in 1992 (Westat, 1998). While a detailed analysis of
these increases, and the possible role of consumer knowledge and education, has yet to be carried
out, the latest empirical analysis on the factors affecting influenza vaccination by Mullahy (1999)
argues that an understanding of the role education and the knowledge of medical benefits play in
the receipt of a flu shot would be a valuable extension of earlier research.
Previous studies have not specifically addressed the impact of knowledge of benefits on
service utilization, but recent data indicate that Medicare enrollees are in general poorly
informed about their health insurance benefits. CMS’s 1996-1998 Market Research for
3

Beneficiaries project* identified multiple deficiencies in beneficiaries’ basic knowledge of the
Medicare program (Barents Group LLC, et al 1998). Although most beneficiaries know about
the major features of Medicare, they tended to have inadequate knowledge of services that are
infrequently used (such as long term care, second surgical opinion, or coverage of durable
medical equipment) or recently implemented benefits (such as influenza and pneumonia
vaccinations). These findings are supported by McCall et al (1986) who surveyed Medicare
beneficiaries in six states and reported a low level of knowledge of Medicare benefits and
supplemental policy benefits. These authors also found that respondents were more likely to be
aware of benefits for the services they use most, including eyeglasses, physician care, and
prescription drugs, rather than infrequently used services such as hospital or nursing home care.
It is also worth noting that other studies of the general population (rather than just Medicare
enrollees) also document gaps and misinformation in consumers’ reported knowledge of health
plans and entitlement programs (Isaacs 1996; Blendon et al, 1997).
In this paper, we explicitly examine the impact of elderly persons’ knowledge of
Medicare benefits on the demand for preventive health care using supplemental questions from
Round 18 of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) regarding beneficiary knowledge
of Medicare. The aim of this analysis is to identify the marginal effect of such benefit
knowledge on demand in order to better value future initiatives to create a more informed health
care consumer. In the remainder of this paper, we describe our conceptual model, methods,
study population, estimation results, interpretations of our empirical findings, and conclusions.

This project intended to provide CMS with an understanding of the needs of Medicare beneficiaries with respect to
two basic questions: what information do beneficiaries want and need from CMS; and how can CMS best get this
information to beneficiaries. This project was conducted by the Barents Group LLC, the Project HOPE Center for
Health Affairs, and Westat, Inc.

Conceptual Model
We use a simple conceptual framework of consumer demand for preventive care to
motivate and interpret our empirical work. In this framework, the consumer faces two uncertain
states of the world in which she is either exposed or not exposed to a preventable disease.
Corresponding probabilities are πE and πN (= 1 - πE). The consumer’s utility function in each
state, i, is U(Hi,Zi;X) ( i = E,N), where Hi is realized health status, Zi is spending on all other
goods and services except the prevention of the preventable disease, and X is a vector of sociodemographic characteristics describing the consumer. HN is health status in the absence of the
disease and we let λ denote the decline in health status due to the disease, Y denote consumer
income, and C denote the cost of preventive services. Assuming that the consumer maximizes
expected utility and that preventive services reduce the probability of disease occurrence in the
event of exposure by the factor (1-θ) (with 0≤θ≤1), the consumer will choose to obtain
preventive services if
(1) θπE⋅ U(HN-λ, Y-C;Z)+ (1-θπE)⋅ U(HN, Y-C;Z) > πE⋅ U(HN-λ, Y;Z)+ (1-πE)⋅ U(HN, Y;Z).
Taking a first-order Taylor series approximation around (HN, Y). subtracting common terms
from both sides and rearranging terms, (1) becomes
(2) -(1-θπE)λ(∂U/∂H) > C(∂U/∂Y).
This simply states that the consumer obtains preventive services when the expected utility gain
from reduced risk of the disease exceeds the utility loss from the financial cost of the services.
The simple framework highlights several ways in which the level of consumer knowledge
can impact the decision to obtain preventive services. First, in the absence of knowledge that the
service is a fully covered benefit, the consumer will overestimate C. Second, the consumer may
5

underestimate their risk of exposure (πE) and/or the severity of the disease (λ). Third, the
uninformed consumer may underestimate the effectiveness of the service in preventing the
disease (1-θ). In formal terms, the dependence of the consumer’s decision upon the level of
knowledge, denoted by K, can be represented in (1) and (2) above by making the variables C, λ,
θ, and πE functions of K.
While this simple model only allows socio-demographc characteristics (the vector X) to
influence the consumer’s decision via preferences, we recognize that other channels for these
influences may in fact be operative. The level of knowledge about key variables (C,λ,θ,πE) may
be correlated with some elements of X. Exposure risk (λ,θ,πE) may also vary with sociodemographic characteristics. To the extent that beneficiaries in varying circumstances differ in
the quality of medical care they can access, they may also face differing levels of λ and θ.
In the empirical implementation of our model, consumer perceptions of C,λ,θ,πE are not
directly observable determinants of preventive service use. We seek to control for variations in
these magnitudes across the sample by including exogenous variables relating to consumer
health status and epidemiologic risk factors, access to care, income, other socio-demographic
characteristics, and consumer knowledge of Medicare coverage for preventive services. The
impact of the consumer knowledge variable, which is the primary focus of our analysis, is
largely a reflection of the influence of C on consumer decisions. Those who know that the
service is covered are aware that the out-of-pocket cost for the service itself is zero and those
who do not know this overestimate this cost. While this suggests that the coefficient for the
consumer knowledge variable in our empirical estimates is mainly a price effect on demand, we
recognize that the knowledge variable may also be correlated with higher estimates of λ or πE ,
6

or lower estimates of θ, because the educational interventions that promoted benefit knowledge
also increased awareness of risks and consequences of exposure and efficacy of prevention. As
discussed below, we also follow previous researchers in allowing for the possibility that the
consumer knowledge variable is itself endogenous and therefore employ an instrumental
variables estimation method.
Data Sources
The principal data source used in our analysis is the annual Medicare Current Beneficiary
Survey (MCBS). Administered to a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries,
the MCBS obtains information from beneficiaries on socio-demographic characteristics, use of
medical care, and indicators of health status and illness. Other respondent characteristics
obtained in the survey include education, household composition, health status, income, and
supplemental insurance coverage. The database also includes the Medicare claims records for
respondents. These claims records describe the exact health services provided and reimbursed
and serve to supplement the beneficiary’s recollection of whether certain medical services, such
as mammography, were provided. Once participating in the survey, a beneficiary is surveyed
three times a year for an in-depth personal interview for three years. Beneficiaries who die
during the course of their survey participation are replaced in the following year of the survey to
keep the average number of survey participants at roughly 14,000 beneficiaries.
In this analysis, we used data on respondent characteristics from Round 16 of the MCBS
(the “health access survey”) administered in Fall, 1996. Information on respondents’ knowledge
of benefits was obtained from supplemental questions from Round 18 of the MCBS, which was
administered later in summer 1997. The questions included a short quiz to test beneficiary
knowledge of the Medicare, as well as questions regarding the beneficiary’s use of the Medicare
7

Handbook and their access to communication technologies. We use five quiz questions from
Round 18. (These questions are given in our Appendix.) The first two ask if flu shot and
mammography are covered services. The remaining three questions test knowledge of Medicare
coverage of physical examinations, rules on provider payment and assignment, and rights to
appeal a payment decision.
An additional data component for the analysis was claims data for all beneficiaries from
the Medicare 5% Part B physician file for calendar year 1996. From these data, we computed
utilization rates for flu shots and mammography for each 5-digit zip code. (Denominators for
these rates were the total number of beneficiaries reporting any claims in each zip code in 1996.)
These rates were matched by zip codes of residence to the beneficiaries in our analysis and were
used as explanatory variables to control for possible neighborhood effects. Differences in
“neighborhood” use rates may be indicative of patterns of diffusion of information (Besley and
Case, 1993) since consumers may learn about their benefits from neighbors who used the service
in question. These rates could also be capturing zip-code-specific variations in access to services
or variations in preferences that we cold not directly observe.
The binary dependent variables in our analysis, for obtaining a mammogram and a flu
shot, were constructed from one year of claims data (September 1, 1997 to August 31, 1998)
following the end of interviewing for Round 18 of the MCBS survey (inAugust 1997). (For
respondents in our study whose participation in the MCBS ended before August 31, 1998, , we
obtained their additional claims data from CMS to complete our 12-month follow-up period)
Thus our dependent variable measures of utilization were collected subsequent to our measures
of consumer knowledge.

8

We also obtained binary indicators of prior use for mammogram and flu shots for MCBS
respondents pertain to calendar 1995. These were based on self-report data in the 1995 MCBS
Cost and Use file.
Estimation Methods and Model Specification
In estimating the effects of consumer knowledge on service use, previous researchers
(Kenkel, 1990; Hsieh and Lin, 1997) have recognized the potential problem that estimated
knowledge coefficients are contaminated by simultaneity bias,In particular, this could arise if
persons with stronger preferences for using a particular service gain knowledge about that
service and its coverage from their providers and from prior utilization experiences. Following
Kenkel, and Hsieh and Lin, we address this problem via the use of instrumental variables for our
measures of benefit knowledge.
In particular, consumer knowledge of benefits is measured directly by a binary indicator
for the correct response to the coverage of flu shot or mammogram quiz questions. Indicators of
responses to the other quiz questions, relating to Medicare program adminstration, were used as
instrumental variables for these knowledge of benefits measures. This procedure was based on
the rationale that enrollees with a good knowledge of the Medicare program are likely to know
about coverage of preventive health care while a “taste” for preventive care will not be correlated
with general Medicare program knowledge.As in Mullahy’s recent work on flu shots, we
estimate a two-stage model with binary dependent variables. The estimated models take the
form
1)

Ki = a0 + a1Yi +Pi + ui

2)

Di = b0 + b1Yi + b2Ki + vi

where K is the binary indicator of benefit knolwedge for beneficiary i Pi is a two-element vector
of binary indicators of general Medicare program knowledge, Di is the binary indicator of
9

preventive service use, Yi is a vector of exogenous determinants of preventive service demand,
and uiand viare random errors that may be correlated. The explanatory variables in the vector Yi
include determinants of the beneficiary’s demand such as income, supplementary insurance
coverage, education, and demographic characteristics. Measures of beneficiary health
characteristics are included on the assumption that these will affect the beneficiary’s perceptions
of exposure risk, severity of illness consequences, and preventive service effectiveness.
Neighborhood use measures are included to account for geographic differences in access which
may be correlated with time costs of obtaining preventive services (a component of C in our
conceptual model) and diffusion of benefit knowledge Finally, we also include a prior use
variable based on the beneficiary’s self-reported prior year use of the preventive service
examined. Prior use will increase consumer knowledge through experience. It will also proxy
for unmeasured “taste” factors that are stable over time. Thus, we view the inclusion of prior use
as providing a more stringent test of the pure effect of benefit knowledge on demand. More
specific definitions for these variables are given in Table 1.
Equations (1) and (2) are estimated via two-stage least squares with Huber-White robust
standard-error estimates for coefficients. The properties of this estimation method for
simultaneous equations with binary dependent variables have previously been described by
Heckman and McCurdy (1985). A recent example of applying this method in a closely-related
context is Mullahy (1999). We note that concern over several deficiencies of least-squares
estimation of linear probability models should be relatively minor in our application. In
particular, robust standard-error estimation allows for heteroscedasticity, while specification
error due to the assumption of a linear functional form should not be a major problem with
dependent variables whose mean values are far from the extremes of the 0-1 interval.
Study Population Characteristics
10

The core analytic sample for the analysis contains complete data for beneficiaries age 65
and older who were living in the community (i.e., who were not living in a short-term or longterm care facility) and who answered Rounds 16, 17, and 18 of the MCBS. We excluded
respondents from this subset who had missing data for the dependent variables or key beneficiary
characteristics, such as income information. Respondents enrolled in Medicare managed care
health plans were also included provided their health service utilization data, which would
normally be abstracted from administrative claims data, was not missing. An analysis of
excluded respondents did not reveal significant economic or demographic differences from the
non-excluded respondents. Although income differences could not be determined directly for
the excluded respondents, a slightly higher percentage of beneficiaries with Medicaid eligibility,
and a lower percentage of beneficiaries with higher education levels, were in the non-excluded
(i.e., study) sample.
Table 1 summarizes the two study samples, one for the entire population to model flu shot
demand and the other restricted to women for modeling mammography screening demand. The
largest age group in the sample is the 65 to 74 year olds, who make up 41 percent of the total
sample. A slight majority of beneficiaries are women (51 percent). About 83 percent of
Medicare beneficiaries in the sample are White non-Hispanic, with African Americans (nonHispanic) comprising the second largest racial group (9 percent), and Hispanics making up 6
percent of the sample. Many Medicare beneficiaries have low incomes, with the largest income
group being $15,000 or less (about 46 percent of the sample). About 41 percent of the sample
has not completed high school. Over half of beneficiaries live with their spouse (53 percent).
Approximately one-third of the sample live in the south (35 percent), and three-quarters live in a
metropolitan area (71 percent). Only 10 percent of the sample are Medicaid recipients and
11

nearly three quarters of the sample (71 percent) have some supplemental coverage (e.g.,
Medigap) purchased directly or provided by a former employer.
A majority of beneficiaries reported they were in excellent, very good, or good health (78
percent). However, 38 percent have been told they have a chronic heart condition, 18 percent
have been told they have cancer, 15 percent have diabetes, 13 percent have emphysema, asthma,
or COPD, and 11 percent have had a stroke. About 41 percent of beneficiaries have a visual
impairment (have some or a lot of trouble seeing) or are blind, while about 45 percent are hard of
hearing (have some or a lot of trouble hearing) or are deaf.
Estimation Results
Table 2 presents the results of the first-stage regressions on 1) flu shot benefit knowledge
for the entire study population and 2) women's knowledge of the mammography screening
benefit. General Medicare knowledge is found to be positively and significantly related to flu
shot benefit knowledge. The same is true for prior use of flu shots. Those likely to have greater
knowledge of the benefit are those with supplemental coverage and those living in rural areas.
Given that supplemental carriers provide another source of information about health benefits,
this result is not surprising. Beneficiaries residing in rural areas may be less inundated with
information than urban populations, and may be better able to attend the information they do
receive. We may also be observing the impact of information campaigns conducted by CMS, the
American Association of Retired Persons, and other social and civic organizations with high
participation in rural regions, such as the Rotary Club and Lions Club. Those residing in the
South are more likely to know about the benefit than those in the Northeast. Those with a heart
condition are more likely to be knowledgeable about the benefit as well. Since heart disease can
require a significant interaction with health care delivery and finance systems, spillover
knowledge to basic preventive care is not surprising. Finally beneficiaries who are married are
12

also more knowledgeable about flu shots. Two explanations for this result may be that a spouse
is another information source, as well as a direct incentive to keep one's partner healthy. Those
less likely to know about the benefit include blacks and males.
A number of the results regarding women’s knowledge of mammography screening are
similar to those found for flu shot benefit knowledge. The factors with the strongest positive
effects on knowledge of the mammography benefit are again good knowledge of general
Medicare program rules and prior use of mammography. Significant positive effects are again
observed for Medigap coverage and for residence in the South. Other features of the results do
not parallel the findings for flu shot knowledge. Blacks and Hispanics are significantly more
likely to know about the mammography benefit, as are persons with Medicaid coverage. Older
beneficiaries are significantly less likely to know about the mammography benefit. There is also
stronger evidence of regional differences in benefit knowledge. One of the largest
mammography benefit knowledge marginal effects was associated with women residing in
Puerto Rico, which again suggests the importance or regional information sources or campaigns.
There is also a positive relationship for women with a history of cancer, which may reflect
increased concern with cancer prevention.
The OLS and 2SLS second stage estimation results for flu shot and mammography
screening demand are presented in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Benefit knowledge for each of
the two preventive services and prior use had strongly significant impacts on service use in both
OLS and 2SLS models. Comparison of the 2SLS and OLS results indicates that OLS tends to
yield a downward-biased estimate of the impact of knowledge on use. This finding is somewhat
surprising but could be explained, at least in part, by the possibility that the prior use variable
accounts for much of the positive correlation between unobservables that increase benefit
knowledge and unobservables that predispose to use of services. In addition, note that in both
13

the flu shot and mammography 2SLS models Basmann's (1960) test fails to reject our
overidentifying exclusion restrictions.
Since the two preventive services are covered with no out-of-pocket cost to the consumer,
the interpretation of the strongly positive results for the Medigap and Medicaid dummies (for
both services) and for the high income dummy (in the case of mammography) is not the usual
straightforward confirmation of negative own-price and positive income effects on demand. An
alternative hypothesis concerning insurance effects is that cross-price effects on preventive
service demand are positive. Beneficiaries who use more curative services (because of lower
out-of-pocket price) may also be more likely to receive recommendations from their physicians
to obtain preventive services. In the case of influenza vaccinations, complementarity in demand
could also arise from joint time costs: the time and inconvenience of obtaining a vaccination are
greatly reduced if it is received at the same time and in the same provider location in which
curative services are received. Both of these arguments could also account for positive income
effects if the income effect on demand for curative services is also positive.
Race and ethnicity appear to have significant effects on flu shot demand. Specifically,
black beneficiaries and Hispanics have significantly lower probabilities of receiving a flu shot,
ceteris paribus. Corresponding effects on mammography demand, however, are not significant..
Our four education dummies are also insignificant in both Tables 3 and 4 although the pattern of
point estimates for their coefficients suggests a positive gradient for a continuous education
measure. Other demographic variables have no significant effects on flu shot demand although
there is weak evidence of a positive age effect. In the case of mammography, age has a strongly
negative effective while the dummy for marital status has a significantly positive coefficient.
Relatively few of the results for the health problems and disability variables are
significant in any of the models. Beneficiaries with one major disease, cancer, have a greater
14

likelihood of receiving each of the preventive services. Women with a hearing problem have a
significantly lower probability of mammography use. Those women with significant (four or
more) limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) are less likely to receive mammography
screening. This finding may reflect individuals who can not seek care independently.
Results for location variables are mixed. The rural population receives more of both
preventive services than those residing in urban areas. On the other hand, neighborhood effects
are not significant at the 0.05 level in either 2SLS model.
In addition to the results just presented, we also estimated our two demand models with
the prior use variables excluded. This did not substantially alter our findings. The magnitude of
the TSLS coefficient for benefits knowledge increased by about 35% in the flu shot model but
was essentially unchanged in the mammography model. Corresponding OLS coefficients
increased in magnitude by about 90% in the flu shot model and about 45 % in the mammography
model. We experimented with using an additional instrument in each of the two demand models
consisting of the binary variable associated with the preventive service knowledge question in
the other demand model. For example, in the model for mammograms, the instrumental
variables used were general Medicare program knowledge and knowledge of the flu shot benefit.
These additional variables yielded little additional predictive value as instruments and resulted in
rejection of the test for our exclusion restrictions. This latter finding could be a refection of the
fact that a “taste” for preventive care is common to both services.
We also examined interaction effects of benefits knowledge with prior use, both by
adding an interaction term to our models and by estimating separate regressions for those with
and without prior use. For flu shot use, OLS estimation of the model with an interaction yielded
a positive and significant main effect for benefits knowledge of 0.055 and a significant
interaction effect of 0.073. Two-stage estimates, with both the main and interaction knowledge
15

variables endogenous, yielded implausibly large coefficients that were very sensitive to the
choice of instruments. In the separate sample regressions, OLS estimation yielded significantly
positive benefit knowledge coefficients of 0.111 and 0.068 for those with and without prior flu
shot use respectively. Two-stage estimation yielded a small and insignificantly positive benefits
knowledge coefficient for those with no prior use and a very large (0.334) and significant
coefficient for those with prior use.
For mammography, OLS estimation of the model with an interaction yielded a positive
and significant main effect for benefits knowledge of 0.082 and a moderately significant (p =
0.078) interaction effect of 0.053. Two-stage estimates, with both the main and interaction
knowledge variables endogenous, yielded large and imprecise coefficient estimates. In the
separate sample regressions, OLS estimation yielded very similar positive and significant
coefficients of 0.110 and 0.090 for those with and without prior mammography use respectively.
Two-stage estimation yielded significantly positive benefits knowledge coefficients of 0.285 and
0.170 for those with and without prior use respectively.
Taken together, these various results suggest that the positive benefits knowledge effects
on use are larger in magnitude for persons with prior use. It is also true, however, that persons
with prior use will tend to have better benefit knowledge. (Mean values of FLUKNOW were
0.852 and 0.631 for persons with and without prior use respectively. Corresponding means for
MAMKNOW were 0.802 and 0.506.) Thus, our results do not necessarily suggest that education
efforts should be targeted specifically to those with prior use; we suspect that it is more cost
effective to target these efforts to groups that have the lowest average level of benefit knowledge.
Discussion
To place the results just described in a broader context, it is useful to compare them with
findings from earlier related studies. First, it is interesting to note that our finding of positive
16

knowledge impacts on demand for services is qualitatively similar to knowledge effects reported
by Hsieh and Lin (1997) and by Kenkel (1990). Our application differs from these previous
works, however, in that knowledge in our study basically measures awareness that the out of
pocket price of a preventive service is zero; thus a positive knowledge effect is clearly to be
expected and is logically consistent with rational consumer behavior. We also note that our main
result is robust to estimation technique (OLS vs. TSLS), and to the inclusion or exclusion of a
measure of prior service utilization as an explanatory variable. Inclusion of this variable does,
however, diminish the magnitude of the knowledge effect.
Our study differed from Hsieh and Lin (1997) by including education variables in the
structural demand function rather than simply using them as instruments for our knowledge
variables. In both our OLS and instrumental variables results, however, we find little evidence
of a general education effect on demand. (We do note that the coefficients for the education
dummies in the mammography regressions suggest the presence of a positive education gradient
in demand.) In alternative empirical models, we tried repeating the approach of Kenkel (1990)
and Hsieh and Lin (1997) to include education as instrument in addition to our other knowledge
variables. This approach yielded similar results. Thus, our results provide support to Hsieh and
Lin’s presumption that when more focused measures of knowledge are available, measures of
general educational attainment can be used as instruments and excluded from the structural
demand function.
Our results for flu shot demand can also be compared directly to the recent findings by
Mullahy (1999). His analysis, based on 1991 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS),
indicates that self-assessed health status has a strong negative relationship to flu shot demand
while years of schooling is a strongly positive predictor. While these results contrast to our own
findings, Mullahy also confirms our result of a significantly lower flu shot probability for
17

African Americans. There are important differences in model specification, which could easily
explain the differences in results. These include our inclusion of income as a demand factor and
the absence from the NHIS data set of many of the variables relating to health and disability
status used in our analysis.
The policy implications of our study are significant in a climate where CMS desires
elderly beneficiaries to play a greater role in their own health service utilization as well as health
plan choice. The results show that knowledge is an important attribute in medical care demand.
Few health care empirical studies measure knowledge directly. The rapidly growing consumer
choice and information literature provides data on self-reported information sources and health
plan choice. With the development of different benefit options for CMS beneficiaries on the
horizon, policy evaluations should consider recording measures of benefit knowledgeas well as
information sources to better understand the value of information dissemination.
An obvious extension of to our analysis would be to examine the impact of Medicare
program knowledge on medical expenditures. This analysis could be used to compute the net
fiscal impact to Medicare of funds spent on direct consumer education campaigns. Given the
fiscal realities of an aging population, a future analysis of the relationship between knowledge,
preventive services use, and health care expenditures would be valuable.
Conclusions
Economists commonly assume that consumers make rational choices with perfect
information. In health care, however, most consumers understand relatively little about the
consequences of their purchases or even the complex arrangements under which these purchases
are made. In this study we specifically focus on consumer knowledge of insurance benefits as it
affects demand for preventive health services. We find that even controlling for prior use (which
could be viewed in part as a proxy for experiential learning), knowledge of the insurance benefit
18

is one of the strongest factors affecting the use of influenza vaccination in the noninstitutionalized elderly population and mammography screening within the female noninstitutionalized elderly. Our findings suggest that strategies to educate the insured Medicare
population about coverage of preventive services may have substantial social value. Our
findings of positive income and insurance effects on demand (in the context of full coverage for
these preventive services), as well as race/ethnicity differences (especially for flu shots) suggest
that complementarities exist between demand for curative and preventive services and that
policies to reduce social disparities in the receipt of curative care among Medicare enrollees will
also reduce disparities in receipt of preventive services.

APPENDIX
MCBS KNOWLEDGE QUESTIONS
The five questions below are the items from the MCBS survey that we used to measure
consumer knowledge. The first two items pertain to flu shot and mammography coverage. The
fourth and fifth items, which pertain to general knowledge about Medicare program rules, were
used as instruments. All items were coded as binary 0-1 variables with 1 signifying the correct
